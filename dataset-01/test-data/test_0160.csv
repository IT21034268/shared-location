5,"VTM great game, must get unofficial patch for bugs","When this game came out, I opted to follow the other major release of the day, Half-Life 2. I figured I'd come back to this game at a later time, and that time is now. Good thing, too, since all the bugs have been polished by a devoted fan following, you need to get the unofficial patches for this game to be able to savor it to its fullest. Search for them on the internet.The game is great in atmosphere, the source engine of its day still provides a very nice offering of visual realism, nice colors, details, etc. The game itself provides an almost endless amount of role-playing choices, similar to the other great RPGs of the era.Overall, I had a highly enjoyable experience playing this game."
5,Terrific guide to kayak paddling/camping in Glacer Bay,"Interestingly written and very informative. His maps are rather crude but used with a NOAA map (17318, 17318a, 17318b) they are excellent guides to camping sites, points of interest, and dangerous currents. 6 of us did a self-guided 115 mile trip over 11 days based on this book. Excellent description of routes almost mile by mile. A must buy if you are going to do any lengthy trip and are trying to minimize surprises."
5,Great CD,"This is a great CD if you get it you'll be suprized. I like to compare it to Music From The Big Pink. Its neat because Robbie Robertson did not sing much in The Band. But he sang wrote all the songs on this CD. its not like The Band but I'm not saying it's bad its still rock but its a differant sound then you might expect. but don't hate it for that, thats the point of a solo album."
2,"decent music, but that voice...","I am dumbfounded by all the praise heaped upon this album. The songs are merely serviceable, and THE MAN CANNOT SING. The fact that it's at all worth a listen is entirely due to Daniel Lanois...and this is arguably his weakest effort. I refer you to Emmylou Harris' ""Wrecking Ball"" if you want to hear Lanois with a truly great singer. There's good reason nobody bought this record in the first place."
4,Malkovich - 5-stars; Everyone else - 3,"This was an enjoyable story, interestingly filmed and told. Malkovich as ""The Great Buck Howard"" was simply brilliant. The movie was funny, quirky, corny, sad, heartfelt and, at times, a little cliche. I really am tempted to go three-stars for this movie because almost everything aside from Malkovich seemed strained, secondary and inferior. I don't mean IN COMPARISON to Malkovich, I mean as it stood. The relationship between Hanks and Blunt was just weird. I know they meant it to be weird, but it wasn't believable and the acting when Malkovich wasn't in the scene was not very good. However, I am sticking with 4-stars because I ended up liking the tone, comedy and story a lot. If the trailer (which basically tells the whole story) interests you, the movie will deliver. If you watch the trailer and say ""This doesn't seem like much of a movie"", then don't press play! There's ""only"" storytelling and characters here."
4,"Pleasant read, but....","Interesting story, nice flow -- BUT, did anyone proofread or spell-check the kindle edition? It has the most errors I've ever found in a book."
4,A successful Project,"The beach Boys and countless other bands at the time were borrowing session people-why not the Monkees? Two fine vocalists-Davy-Baritone-Mickey-Tenor,two fine instrumentalists-Peter and Mike(a fine songwriter in his own right)-and some of the most creative pop to come out of that decade. Randy Scouse Git alone is as -dare I say it?-as innovative as anything else to come out of that summer of (Sgt. Pepper)love. Thank you Mickey. Experimentally as good as most pop coming out of that era. I only wish Mike would have been at the 2001 Westbury Music Fair Concert, which was professional, exciting,and brought back warm memories. Screw the hippie press- the Monkees were real, talented, and fun. God Bless Them!"
4,The Monkees fire Donny Kirshner and the outcome is this...,"a kicking album with a 60s garage band feel to it. The Monkees get liberated and decide just to jam on this one. Even though Micky's drums aren't exactly the best, everything else is very good. A definite must have for you kids out there that have your parent's credit cards and a mad collection of Monkees pictures on your wall."
3,More experimental weirdness needed....,"What happened to the cool time shifts and odd chords? What happened to the cool lyrics? The weird effects? Thanks to Jason, Voivod may become a commercial sellout. :( All the things that he himself liked originally about this band may be killed by his influence. I was really hoping for another Nothingface but got something really dull."
1,totally inadequate screws,"Otherwise well-made, but suffers from a fatal flaw that makes it virtually useless. Pitch and yaw adjustment are done by loosening and tightening two small screws on each side of the mount. The screws strip very easily, so you can't tighten them with much force, and even as tight as you can get them, the slightest bump to the projector will knock it off-balance (and my PJ is well under the 25-pound weight limit). This mount would have been far better without the ability to adjust pitch and yaw at all. Go with a geared mounting system instead (PRG-UNV)."
2,Had to return it,"No actual experience with the mount, but I had to return it because the color was black which was not noted in the posting by Amazon. Either silver or white would have been fine. Since then I have learned that on Peerless mounts a s suffix = sliver, w = white and no suffix means black. The low rating is for omitting the color from the posting. I'll post later on my return experience."
4,Well done,Had this book when I was a child. It spurred a lifelong interest in paleoanthropology. It was a good introduction to the subject.
4,disney cd's,"this is a great pack of music-all the original songs. my little ones weren't thrilled with some of the really ""old"" songs."
2,Don't buy this.,Pills slip on smooth surface - you often get an 80/20 split. Doesn't like oval pills. The Apex Ultra Pill Splitter is a better choice.
5,Good Purchase,"After buying a pill splitter that required many adjustments, I wanted something that does the job quickly and accurately. This pill splitter meets my requirements. No crumbles or powdery medication. Would highly recommend especially if you have arthritic joints and need ease of use."
1,Doesn't work well,"This is a cheap item, but you get what you pay for. The pill I split is round, and on this cutter it never comes out in half. Plus, it leaves a lot of crumbs and powder. I can do a better job with my own little pocket knife."
5,Top notch pill splitter,"The reason we selected this pill splitter was the simple durable design. Too often the ones we bought in stores broke after a few uses. The Apex has few moving parts, so it does the job and lasts."
1,Cheap Quality,I was looking for a quality pill cutter/splitter and the search will continue. I purchased a Rite Aid Pill Cutter and it was ok...some pills did crumble sometimes during cutting. So I decided to get the Apex Ultra Pill Splitter and it was worst than the one that I currently own. The new device made more crumble than my old one.
3,After about 4 months its broken,"I use it mostly for oblong pills, which as other reviewers have said its not that great for. But it works, just takes more time to ensure the pill is lines up correctly and even still it isn't always exact. After about 3 months the plastic piece that works a safety broke, but it still works. Now the holder it starting to get off center, so again it still works but now its a bit more work to try to get an accurate split of the pill. It wasn't a lot of money, but still I wouldn't recommend it. I'm going to try a different brand/type."
2,Spring broke after 3 months of light usage,"Uses a piece of plastic to act as a spring for opening the pill splitter. The spring cracked within 3 months with light usage. Pill splitter is still usable, but one must open the device without the help of a spring. Maybe used the device 40 times during 3 months of ownership."
4,"Doesn't cut small pills well, but okay for large ones","I needed a good pill cutter for various sizes, so I thought this one would work well, but it did not cut the small pills evenly. Worked well on the big pills for even cuts.So overall great pill cutter for large pills, not so well for small pills. Material is made of good quality."
4,works very well,I reccomend this to others as it works pretty well. The only thing is that it dose not split pills right down teh center. I think it would be too hard to try and design one that split every pill perfectly
1,Very short life,"I bought this pill splitter in November 2012 and have only used it to cut a pill every other day. In early February 2013, it quit working because the sliding plastic that covers the blade has jammed the pivot, preventing opening and closing the unit properly. While it worked, it splitted my oblong pills perfectly. Obviously, this device has malfunctioned after very little service."
5,Apex Ultra Pill Splitter,"After struggling with a razor blade and having pills crushed rather than split, this little tool is the ultimate. Works great!!!"
1,For more fun - throw your money away!,"I bought this splitter less than five months ago. Right from the start, I knew that I had made a bad choice. Instead of cleanly and neatly splitting the pill on the perforated line, it pulverized the pills into dust. After three uses, the hinge became difficult to open/close. After five uses, the hinge completely broke and this splitter is in the garbage. It does not even deserve one star."
5,Perfect,"This pill splitter works as advertised. I""ve used it to split pills from the size of an aspirin down to half that size."
1,Looking for another brand/type,I have had 2 of these pill splitters and do not like it....a plastic piece on the inside of this contraption keeps coming out and is hard to replace and won't stay in place when you do replace it. It won't cut the pills that I have tried to split very well....only have one usuable half and one pulverized half after trying to split them. I won't buy another one and am currently trying to find another one that works better.
2,Worked very well. Until it didn't.,"This worked like a charm, cutting pills precisely and easily, until one day it broke on me. There is a cheap plastic piece near the hinge that gave out (I probably chopped under 20 pills in the six months I used it). For that reason, I won't take a chance on this product again. Too bad, because the price was good and it worked well for a while."
1,Complete piece of sh**,"This is the first pill cutter I've ever bought and it is just a POS. It works fine for maybe a month or two at most, then the curved plastic blade guard at the bottom starts to crack and eventually breaks, creating a risk of cutting yourself by accident. The first time it cracked I took it back to the drugstore and they let me exchange it for another one. That was 2 months ago. And now it's breaking again. I am extremely careful with how I use products so I know it has nothing to do with my using it the wrong way. Stay away from this brand and style of pill cutter."
3,"Good, but doesn't last forever, or very long","I like this pill splitter a lot, but it only lasted for about 18 months. I have, however, ordered it again. It cuts pills cleanly and easily and I like that they can fall into a receptacle. But I would like it to last longer. The shield over the blade came off and it wouldn't work.Well, the second one only lasted for 4 months. The shield, which moves, broke. How about improving the product? I am really torn about buying it again."
1,Disappointing,"DISAPPOINTING!!! With its great specs I bought it immediately, it turned out to be GARBAGE. Whenever I watch a movie it pauses or goes into slow motion by itself. After a night mare with the technical support since they only answer every ten days they admitted they have a manufacturing problem as mentioned below:""Hello Fahad,We found this problem is due to the SDK from the chip manufacturer, and we have reported this problem to the chip manufacturer and waiting for the update. This takes time to get update from the chip manufacturer. As soon as we get update, we will fix this problem.Regards,Eric""It seems they have launched a product which is not fully tested. Ever since the answered me they stopped responding to emails. Now I'm stock with this machine, a total disaster.Take my advise don't think of it.."
5,Garden of Eden,"This book, along with Follett's Pillars of the Earth, is my favorite read in a long time. Why? It's tightly written, suspenseful, believable, clever, fast paced, and enjoyable to read.I would challenge anyone who didn't enjoy this offering to submit the name of a better written novel.OK Schumann lacked charisma and the ending was a bit of a letdown. Notwithstanding these flaws, it was a nice ride."
1,Disappointed,"This book is an overdue library book from the Palm Beach Library. It is very used, stained and was wet at one time. I'm disappointed and will be looking to buy a better copy."
4,Garden Of Thugs,"No other book I have read quite gives the image of Nazis as thugs as this novel does. It was one interesting read full of suspense and action. Well written. Paul Schuman is a killer with a soul. Deaver did an excellent job with the dialogue, even going so far as to include the differences in speech pattern when a native born German speaks English. But with all this praise there must be negatives to speak of or else I would have given 5 stars. The ending was too happy, nearly everyone got what they wanted. While it was good it just didn't reach out and grab me which I require a novel to do to warrant 5 stars."
2,Let's be nice,"I work and travel to Miami. I think the bookis a good guide but is insulting to adults.In the night life section, it is o.k. to be gayor lesbian but when you are an older adult theauthor will dog you and tell you that it is pastyour bed time for a good Latin music club. Hey,be nice and ""inclusive."""
1,Junk Tool - Poorly Manufactured with Poor Materials That Are Soft And Bend,"I bent several links due to the tool's inherent misalignment. Every tool on the shelf that day was improperly aligned. (In an attempt to find a properly aligned tool, I opened all of the packages to find they were all like that. I bought it anyway because I needed to fix a chain and had no tool available.)I continued to use this tool on a few more chains. The driving threads quickly stripped and both plates that brace the chain bent. This was due to the metal being too soft for the intended application, exacerbated by the improper alignment of the driving mechanism. (Probably put undue force on the plates, but whatever who cares - just know it does not work.)This tool is junk. Don't buy it unless your only intent is to pull one chain off that will itself, be discarded... along with the tool after that first use."
1,Not Canon Brand,Be careful ordering this item: the one I received was not a Canon brand lens hood. When I ordered mid-Jan 2011 the seller was listed as Joseph D Utley. If I had wanted an aftermarket product I would have ordered one for a third of the price of this one.I contacted amazon customer sevice immediately and was told I could not exchange the item I received for a Canon brand item (as advertised) because it came from a third-party seller. So I returned it for a refund. I am very frustrated that the lens hood I received was not the Canon brand as advertised.
2,"Disappointed, not really Canon","What I received was not ""Canon"" product as pictured, it was just stamped ET-60. Product quality lacking, was a hassle to try to fit to lens, even then it was not a good fit. Check with seller to be sure your getting a hood that is stamped ""Canon ET-60 Japan"", the couple dollars extra is worth it! It was ""Utley"" useless!"
4,Maybe a bit big,"Even for a telephoto zoom, this lens hood is a pretty good size, sticking some 3"" out past the lens. However, it is very lightweight, durable and will protect your lens from the occasional bump that always seems to happen, especially with such a long lens on your camera. It is rather a pain taking it on an off whenever you want to store your lens back in a case, so I suggest getting a longer lens case and just leaving it on."
2,If only Campbell were the author...,"There's not much to say. The book isn't confusing because the material is too technical--it's often confusing because the author doesn't go in enough depth; it's frustrating when a crucial concept is presented, such as Hamilton's Law, but no examples on its applications are put forth. I find myself frequently searching the internet to suppliment this textbook. It also doesn't help that the book doesn't come with a cd-rom, or any additional material, unless you purchase the teacher's edition...reading this textbook makes me yearn for Campbell."
1,Heed the WARNINGS - This product WILL disappoint,"I hate to sound like a broken record, but some things can't be said enough. I have used this washer four times since receiving it as a father's day gift last year. It has broken four times without finishing a task, a 100% failure rate. The replacement part costs fifteen dollars each time, with a life expectancy of fifteen minutes if you're lucky. Karcher does not respond to customer inquiries - buy this and you're on your own."
2,Buyer beware.,"Content of book is great however, condition of this library book was not ""like new"" as described by seller."
1,Missing Diagrams and Pictures,The Kindle Edition is simply a repackaging of the text from Project Gutenberg and is missing the pictures and diagrams. The complete book is available from Google Books.
2,Firtst Book of Farming,"Better than twenty pages failed to print in whole or part, especially in Index. Suggest a bit more quality control!"
1,"also ""Protection"" freeze","We got this system in June, and although it worked great for a few months, this weekend it froze in the ""Hello - Protection - Goodbye"" described in other reviews here. Reading others' experiences, I expect we'll just replace this with something that doesn't have so many dissatisfied customers."
1,Don't buy it!,The DVD player worked for about 4 weeks. It has been in the repair facility for four weeks and now I'm told the laser replacement part is backordered and will not be available for another 6 weeks. Don't buy this unit!
3,Disappointed,My mistake. I thought Lynn N. Austin was the same Lynn Austin who wrote many other books. Not to be. This book didn't come close.
1,DANGEROUS & CHEAP!,"This gate is the worst baby product we have EVER bought! It took my husband around two hours to properly install it and the next day the hardware came out the wall.. he fixed it again, this time putting anchors in the walls. A few hours after that my 13 month old figured out how to open it. About a week after buying and installing it, it completely fell on our brand new hardwood floors and gashed them badly! Now we have floors that need to be reapired and holes in our walls that don't line up with other gates."
1,Step Away from the Gate,"This gate is simply worthless. After wasting two hours of my Labor Day, I finally have it attached to the wall. Using the templates was worthless, as they didn't match up correctly. After drilling countless holes in the wall, I finally found a semi-straight alignment. Now the gate doesn't close without using significant pressure, and it takes two hands and a foot for my wife to get it open.This gate was designed by a very cruel individual who likes to make parents suffer.Stay far away from this gate."
1,Get something else,"First, the templates did nothing for us- when put together as directed, it was completely misaligned.Second, my toddler was standing on it (briefly) and the plastic pieces completely broke in half with the screws still attached to the wall! It bounces and if you have a child that will stand on it, this gate is not for you."
5,Rampage Light Bar,"Light bar fit perfectly. Easy to install with existing flat 4 connector. Increases safety with improved ""attention getting"" lighting on rear of vehicle."
5,Modified to use on Cargo Carrier,"I occasionally use a hitch carrier on the back of our SUV. It sticks out behind our vehicle about 2 feet. I've been worried about visibility by other vehicles especially at night. Attached light bar on rear bracket of cargo carrier, plug into hitch connector and instant security. It is easily seen, unobtrusive, and gives depth to the cargo being hauled."
1,Boring,"This film is arguably the most boring film I have ever seen. We watched it from beginning to end and the director's fascination with this obsessive little girl, who never seems to actually mature during the film, is astounding. The camera just follows the cute little girl around as she sulks and then screws the next guy in line. She's in love . . . she's in love. Yeah, so is every 13 year old girl on the planet. Grow up and get an actual job. Get on with your life girl."
4,help to remove glare!,Works as it should be. I attached it on XSi and it fits well without gap. You can attach the hood in the opposite direction for easy storage and transportation. The price is a little expensive for a plastic piece.
4,Pretty life saving!,Put this on in my sons room one night during a wind storm...he has listened to it to sleep every night since!!! That was three years and two copies of this disc ago!! There is one song on it that gets louder than the others and disrupts me if it isn't turned down low enough if I'm in the room sleeping but he sleeps great to it!
2,whoa this is odd,"i was surprised, this cd was a big disapointment. comapred to leaving thru the window its really crappy. thats being generous"
3,different,"When i walked into the record store i was a bit skeptical on wether i would be satisfied with the new something corporate. I've been a fan of them for a while and the rest of the drive thru bands as well, but i had read many reviews that sed this album was different then their previous work. BUT i knew i had to buy it. after listening to this album a few times i'm a little dissapointed with the change but..yanno things gotta change. ""space"", ""the runaway"", ""ruthless"", and ""21 and invincible"" are the better songs on the cd. all in all its not THAT BAD of a cd."
3,North vs. Leaving through the window & Ready...break,"I consider myself to be a pretty big fan of SoCo - I've followed the band since they first began and have every single song that they've ever sang on my computer. When I first listend to Ready...Break & Leaving Through the Window, I fell in love with the band. North, however, is somewhat disappointing. Don't get me wrong, there are still awesome songs on it like ""Matches"", ""She Paints Me Blue"", & ""Me & the Moon"" and good songs like ""21 and Invincible""...but it just doesn't do it for me like the other two CDs did. I had to listen to the tracks a couple of times in order for it to grow on me. Overall alright, but if you're a first time listener I'd recommend Leaving Through the Window."
2,Falling Short,"Something Corporate debuted with Leaving Through the Window, a spectacular piece of piano driven indie rock. They set the bar high, and in their sophomore album did there very best to get as far from even equalling their past effort. North is a flop of the highest order. When the band has a chorus worth shouting - the Anthem worthy ""Space"" - they stop after one go around and kick it back into a low gear. Not a smooth transition and not a good song. Furthermore, the entire first half of the album, with the exception of ""She Paints Me Blue,"" is convuluted. The best tracks come with ""Ruthless"" and everything after. Too bad the band decided to embody the concept of sophomore slump. Maybe they can break off into side projects and do something worthwhile, or at least try to recapture their original magic."
5,*bursts into ecstatic applause*,"This is one awesome CD. Unlike some other bands (cough...Saves the Day...cough), Something Corporate just gets better with time. North clearly showcases both Andrew and Josh's maturity in songwriting and musicianship. It is definitely significantly darker and more emotional than anything SoCo has released before. I can't really put down any of the songs on this CD, although I like ""21 and Invincible"" a little less because it doesn't have as much meaning (not to say it's a bad song, because it's not). The highlights of the album are probably ""Me and the Moon,"" ""Ruthless,"" ""I Won't Make You,"" and ""She Paints Me Blue."" If you like this CD, or just like Something Corporate, or just like emo, I would suggest also getting some of their past cds/singles/eps (Leaving Through the Window, Audioboxer, Ready...Break), because basically everything they write is amazing. Oh, and they are even better live.; )"
5,Enchanting!,The gorgeous illustrations are accompanied by simple pop ups and 3-dimensional cut outs. This book is a beautiful compliment to the other Cicely Mary Barker books in my collection and has a sparkling surprise ending. A charming trip to fairyland. I don't think you will be at all disappointed in this enchantng tale.
3,beautiful graphic but..,"I ordered three as gifts, but the lights on the last pages don't work at all"
3,Not as good as the others,"I purchased this book after buying the other Fairyopolis books. It is definitely my least favorite of the series. The illustrations are characteristically beautiful and there is a storyline. However, the pop-ups are not very elaborate and the lights on the last page were a complete failure. They worked the first time we opened the book and never again. My daughter was disappointed and every time we read it, she complains about how poorly made the book is."
2,Sappy!,"This movie looked interesting given it's description in Amazon. However, it was a real disappointment! It is a sappy ""B"" grade movie, not a hidden gem. The Eleanor Parker character is so tiresome, and unrealistic, as the backwoods girl doggedly pursuing the man she wants. Robert Taylor's performance is mediocre as well. There are very few movies that I buy, and after watching once, turn into the used DVD store for cash. This will definitely be one of them! Don't waste your time watch this 1950's ""B"" grade comedy."
4,Comedy western,Really enjoyed this movie. Good plot development and acting. Had some serious moments too. It all works well together. The fight with Indian in the cave is hilarious slapstick.
1,Run Away!!!!,"Wireless mouse did not reach more than 1 foot from receiver; also not clear that the mouse and keypad are much smaller than standard; hard to type on keypad, mouse difficult to manipulate."
2,OK,My wife wanted a keypad and mouse for her new laptop - this is fairly simple to install and works well except for the fact that the mouse goes through batteries like water through a sieve. If you get this I suggest using good rechargeable batteries and keeping at least one pair fully charged at all times.
3,Targus PAKP003U Wireless Keypad and Mouse Combo,"Overall optical response on the mouse is good. However, placing the USB receiver on the other side of my laptop (opposite the mouse) causes decreased functionality to the point of inoperability. The On/off button on the mouse is a little hard to operate (requires a fingernail and some patience). The 10-key pad works well."
1,Terribly frustrating,"Only after several failed attempts (including hours of ""charging"") and much frustration did I learn that this product was not compatible with Windows 7 (last worked with Vista). Seems like something they should mention. Someplace."
2,wireless keypad,I purchased this so i would have a number key pad but you have to push the numbers really hard before they will work and then it does several of the same number. Also the mouse does not hold a charge for very long!
1,Horrible,This is the worst product I have ever purchased. The mouse will not work unless the USB cable us plugged in and after about a hour the keypad does not key numbers. Very disappointing product.
4,Fun for the Spongebob lover in your house!,This is a great set of Legos. It's so cute. My daughter and son both love putting the sets together and creating a play area. They act out scenes from the shows and have fun with them. TA couple of the pieces do fall apart of they are played with so they learned to not touch them very much.It has provided hours of fun for my kids.
4,Bikini Bottom fun... eventually,"In our home the Spongebob fan is 6-years old. The problem is that the subject matter appeals to kids too young to assemble the product. However, once it was together he enjoyed it thoroughly. He takes good care of his 'stuff' so the Krusty Krab still stands a month after assembly was complete. A child who is tough on his or her toys will not get much use from this set as the completed building is typically fragile."
1,Missing CD,Took forever to receive it and when it did come there was no CD with it. I won't buy books for school here again!
3,'Music the art of listening' book,book was in perfect shape. It supposed to be comming with CD-Rom that includes 3CD's. Thats was missing and seller didnt bother about it.I was dissapointed but again book was great brand new shape but would be too expensive without CD's. Seller included only 1CD witch is general info CD. Seller told me to purchase CD's separately. That was wrong.
5,Ah...The rocky voice of Barzotti!,"I am an Afropean and I think all of us love great European music, like the Claude Barzotti's.We all grew up with these guys 's music.Thank you Amazon."
1,Creepy,This book is creepy. I scares me to think that there are people out there who believe that reciting things like this could be helpful.
5,The Happiest Man Alive.,"There's a reason they call him the ""Happiest Man Alive"". Reading this book, you're gonna find out why. A confession of sorts, Miller's writing reads like your favorite (dirty) old uncle telling you a bedtime story. This, along with ""a.k.a. Dorothy Drab"" has to be my two favorite books by men of all time. Buy it, keep it, treasure it. It doesn't get much better than this."
2,Waste of time.,I read this book on the advice of a friend who said it was an american literary masterpiece. To my surprise I found the book boring and devoid of any value. Miller spews out a self-absorbed diatribe intermingled with profane and tedious nonsense.After a while I thought - why am I wasting precious time on this book?There are other far better literary works.
2,A great writer that I just can't stomach.,"I will not argue the point - Henry Miller is a fantastic writer, more a modern poet than a memoirist or novelist, I believe. His writing is completely unabashed, unbridled, triumpantly violating every taboo. He has the same bombasticness and authoritative voice as someone like Whitman, but if Whitman is life's celebrant, Miller is its misanthrope.Reading Tropic of Cancer consistently put me in the foulest of moods. What drives this book ultimately is disgust and dissatisfaction, and all of Miller's talk of rot and vomit and stench and decay made my skin crawl. I completely understand why Miller is considered to be at the forefront of modern literature, he obliterates all known writerly conventions with this book. But while reading ""Tropic"" might be important, it's far, far from pleasant."
2,didn't get it?,"I really looked forward to reading this book, and it had its good points, which escape me at this time, seeing as I read this book roughly seven months ago. I was disappointed by it and would not consider reading it again. I guess I just don't like the way Miller writes. I was not shocked or offended, just bored and annoyed most of the time. I enjoyed the bits that were in French, and it was funny when that guy (Nonentity?)[went to the bathroom] in the bidet, but overall, I could have lived without reading this book."
5,A jewel in Litereture,"Reading 'The Tropic of Cancer', as with other of Miller's, is not essentially about a 'story' per-se but about falling in love with literature. I would find myself, mid- through, the book wanting to toss it away; as much he would - at times - annoy me with his never ending sentences and paragraphs ... yet i am glad I did not, becuase through his words one learns a very important lesson:- that to live and joy, despite all the tradegy and comedy of life."
2,Quality not so good,CD is not as new as it was advertised. It has some scratches and some parts did not play well. Had to miss out on some of the episodes coz it got jammed. FIgured to return products sold by third parties to Amazon is a pain.... happened once and not nice experience!
5,Forensic Fun,"Diane France is a forensic anthropologist. She solves murder cases and disappearances. She helped discover bones from the Guam incident in 1997 and at Ground Zero, 9/11. This is a great book to read because it teaches you about cases you've never heard about like the Romanov bones and Diane's cast of her face and a tiger's tongue."
2,Poor design on 'single' application - no cap on applicator,"I use drops at night and again in the morning. I use a small amount from the same 'single dose' applicator. TheraTears is the ONLY such applicator I've found whose twist-off does not make a cap to the applicator. This makes the applicator less sterile and safe for me for the morning dose. It also means I have to leave it under the lamp instead of putting it back in the container, which keeps it in the dark.I realize that TheraTears is trying to force me to use another applicator in the morning to move more money from my pocket into theirs, but I can't afford that, so what they HAVE done is make it less convenient and safe for me. As a result, they won't be moving ANY money from my pocket into theirs because I will be buying a different brand."
5,Great product,I have gone through many bottles of this stuff. It takes the sting away when used before insertion and soothes your eyes when used during wear. I have recommended it to friends and they love it too. I consider this a must-have product.
4,Freaky but cool!,"Hi, my name is Kristin. I love this album!! I don't know much about music, but they make me dance and sing along! I get happy when I listen to Ushiro Sugata ga kilei. Hi Ali!!"
3,Not What I Expected,"I heard Evergrey's single for ""A Touch of Blessing,"" and loved what I heard. Then I read a few reviews that recommended this disk over that one, so I bought this one. Maybe it's because I am new to this band, but this disk seems to have weak song writing.There is a quality to Evergrey that is just off the mark. Maybe they are trying too hard? I don't know, but I find myself mentally pushing for that last 'little bit"" when I listen to this cd. I don't really listen to it very often, though I break it out and give it a try hoping it is the type of music that you hate at first and grow to love...but it ain't happening so far.So not nearly as bad as the band, Mastermind, but definately not on par with other bands in the genre such as Riverside, Opeth, Zero Hour and of course Dream Theater. Three stars, but just barely.~J"
3,Bonsai Jade Tree w/Blue Pot,I loved the customer service I was given by Amazon but I was upset with the details of this gift that I bought my daughter. I know pictures don't always match what is sent and it was very true in this case. I expected the pot that was in the picture. My daughter sent me pictures and the pot was different. If they had told me that there was a possibility of a different pot I think I wouldn't have ordered it because it was a combination of the pot and the plant that I liked. Maybe I'm being picky but I expected a pretty blue pot that had design depth to it instead of the blue/black square dish that my daughter received.
1,All leaves fell off within a month,"Tree arrived in decent condition, but quickly started to drop leaves. All instructions followed and even bought care book. I see the good reviews here, but I would not roll the dice again! Worst purchase I've made on Amazon."
4,Water pot that's not,The tree came well packaged and is healthy so far. The water pot is nice to have but there's no mention that there are root holes in the bottom for water to leak out. A water tray is still required and should be mentioned to keep novices like myself from little accidents like I had all over my desk.
3,Nice plant but no tray,"The bonsai is a nice plant, and it did arrive in good condition and with instructions on how to care for it. My only complaint is the lack of a tray, and since the pot has holes in it you will need one. Shame, as if they included one this would be a lovely gift, but without it was a little disappointed."
2,"Arrived fine, died fast","It arrived quickly, despite the fact that I live in an apartment and UPS won't leave the package... The plant was in good shape, and I gave it as a gift to my grandma who loves plants.However, though she followed the care directions the tree died quickly. So at least she has a pretty pot to grow something else in. The grass sprout thing is still alive.Bottom line: I wouldn't buy it again."
5,Nice gift!,"I had good luck with this tree. I gave it to two different people as a gift. I saw one and it looked like the picture except it didn't have the second plant, just an empty space. It was everything they said it was. The price fluctuated and of course I felt better at the lower price"
5,Want to know what to do with that theme fabric you bought?,"Susan's book will give you great ideas for using that theme print in beautiful quilts. It's one of those ""why didn't I think of that?"" books with plenty of instructions and color ideas. Her second book MORE CLEVER QUILTS gives you more and different quilts, well worth the purchase."
5,"Living Well, is listening to this CD.","First off, if you haven't heard of Midtown... Now is the time to jump on this great sound. Each song from their new album ""Living Well is the Best Revenge"" will make you want to keep going so you can listen to more of their catchy lyrics. There's a song that everyone can relate to on this cd. This CD is about true life. You wont find anything fake in the lyrics, and you can relate to it all. That's what makes this cd such a great thing."
2,Another One Bites The Dust!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,If you liked their first cd this one is not for you it is softer and less hard as expected nowadays because everyone is trying to make it to the mainstream. ...
4,great cd for kids who like punk/emo,"This cd is pretty great and it shows how great midtown is. ""More Like A Movie"" is probably my favorite song on this album. As usual it's great catchy music you can dance and sing along too."
2,Disappointing Follow-Up,"Let me preface this by saying that Save the World, Lose the Girl is one of my favorite all-time albums. The songs had such variety and flavor. I was continuously impressed by Midtown's vocal and instrumental talents, as well as their ability to be both emotional and harder.Everything that made their first CD great is sadly lacking in Living Well Is the Best Revenge. I don't even know where to start. Everything is just mediocre, the variety, the music, the lyrics. The vocal harmonies that made the first cd so wonderful somehow come across as hollow as cheesy, almost like old malt shop bubble-gum style music. It's like they lost their unique-sounding blend of emo and pop-punk and became just another unremarkable pop-punk band. There literally wasn't a single song that struck me in the way that the first CD did. I hope their next CD will be a return to what made them popular."
5,Great product for a very low price,I was very pleased with the doorbell I received. It arrived in almost half the time I was quoted. I was told 7 to 10 business days but received it in 3 or 4. The chime is small and doesn't stick out like a sore thumb on my wall. The price was almost 1/2 of what many retail stores were charging for similar products. I feel that I received an excellent product for a great price.
2,If it doesn't work out of the package......give up,"I never had to work so hard to install a ""C"" battery. One battery is a very tight fit and no room for your fingers.And that's just the beginning. I finally got 3 batteries in the chime and one in the button and then.....nothing, it did'nt work.After reading the manual I learned that this thing uses electronic jumpers to achieve 64 codes and stop interference. The jumpers (tiny bridges that fit over pins on the circuit board) are very hard to get to, there are a total of 14, 7 in the chime and 7 in the button. It takes experimentation to figure out what works.I eventually found the right combination and then found that the head of the supplied screw for the chime didn't fit in the keyway slot on the back. Not a biggie...just added to the hassle.Too much aggravation for a $17 product."
3,Lots of Barney fun!,"This is a great set of Barney DVDs perfect for any Barney fan. With three full DVDs for less than $20 you really can't go wrong! The DVDs features Barney, BJ, Riff, and Baby Bop along with fun animals, letters, and the world! My boys (3 and 5 years old) watched the DVDs and danced around with Barney and his friends. They love the silly songs and that there are real kids on the show. I should add too that since these DVDs have already been released years ago, you should make sure you don't have them already if you are buying this set."
3,The Kid in the front row,"Quality of Film - well poorish. Contents by 2009 standards rubbish.N.B. Back projection, stock shots etc etc. BUT in an exercise inNostalgia for the Kid in the Front row very well worth it.Anyone got a copy of Johnny Mack Brown in Billy the Kid - WIDESCREEN!!"
2,What the ....?,"This movie was really good in the beginning...hence the two stars. The story revolves around two children who have a rough life, one is a cast out in school who also lives in low income housing. The boy is losing his mother to cancer. It is a very sad situation, and the children who play these characters are adorable. They were by far the best part of this movie, hence the two stars. The children dare each other to do insane things to get past their sadness, however, as they grow up, they don't mature whatsoever. They still act as though they are seven years old. The things that they do will boggle your mind, and you'll wonder how they haven't been locked away yet. The whole story itself just completely gets out of control and becomes so unbelievable, you have to watch just to see how crazy it can actually get...and take my word for it, it's nuts. The bad part about that is...it was meant to be taken seriously. This film was just not worth the hour and a half it took to watch it."
3,probably not worth it,"This item was smaller than i expected - i probably should have read the description better. THe boxes to write stuff is probably sufficient but still seems small. this item is definitely pocket sized though which should make it easy to take with for christmas shopping excursions. I also thought by the description that it would give stocking stuffer ideas - it doesn't. the book is basically a bunch of tabled pages for you to write stuff in. It is significantly cheaper to go to walmart and buy a small notebook and just make the tables yourself but if you need ""neat and orderly"" this may be good for you."
4,Great for the Beginner,"This DVD had everything I was looking for: an introduction to some of the basic yoga postures (such as the tree and downward dog), as well as a great stretching workout for the whole body. The wonderful British accents of the instructors are terrific for relaxation--another big plus. Although the editing is a little sloppy (it's obvious that some segments were spliced in from other videos), it can be overlooked in light of the overall package. This two-disc DVD is probably not for the hardcore yoga enthusiast, but perfect for the newbie. Because it provides such a wonderful balance to my cardio and weight-training regimen--and because it feels so darned good--I actually look forward to popping it in the DVD player."
4,"Complicated test, nice job at presenting material.","The PMP exam is tough. This book makes a decent attempt at presenting everything - and I think it succeeds - yet the subject matter has yet to be conveyed in plain English. It can be. Sure, there is a lot of PMI-specific lingo that you need to know, but I think someone should try writing with vocabulary beyond it.Its the best guide Ive seen."
4,Very useful reference.,"The book is very well organized, very useful, and good exercises. The best in this area. Strongly recommend it."
4,Passed easily!,"Not sure whether this book was the reason for me passing or the PM PowerTrac CBT tool by Management Concepts (the company I work for has multiple licenses for this). I didn't really do much of the sample questions, I left that to PowerTrac; the content is pretty good though and is readable. I think the key to passing is to understand the structure of the questions and do a few example exams. All in all, my preparation for the exam was about a month, and I wasn't very disciplined either!"
1,Time to move on,"I eagerly awaited this book, anticipating that Marcinko would give us some insights and wisdom on the new world of terrorism that we face. Instead, we get gratuitous violence, less than credible leaps between events, a silly plot and ending, and a poorly written book. It's time to move on, and if you're a fan in need of a Marcinko fix, go back and read the early classics such as Red Cell, or any of the 'color' team titles...those were great books. This one seems like everyone--the author, the publisher, and maybe even us as fans--want to recreate the past greatness, and, based on this effort, it's not happening."
1,Demo Dick is Done,"I have all of Dick Marcinko's book and I'm finding all the plots are like this....... Navy Seal, blah, blah, blah. Set-up Seal Team Six, blah, blah, blah. Formed Red Cell, blah, blah, blah. Love violence and gore, blah, blah, blah. In this book he loves G.W., even though his old man's administration put him in the clink for a year and didn't finish off Saddam off when could, now G.W. has to go finish the job that will cost the taxpayers millions. Obviously Seals are not hired for their intelligence.My last Marcinko book. The Rogue Warrior is getting Old. Stop living in the past and tells what you've done yesterday - instead of writing this cash cow to death."
5,Read it,"This is the first book that i read that got me into reading. Though it is for younger readers, older readers can not go wrong in reading this series. It has the spirit and the adventure found in good fantasy books."
3,"Reluctant reader, reads this Fantasy","After reading the 2nd book in this series, I greatly became dulled and bored of this quintet. But reluctantly continued, and read The High King. may I proclaim, this is a must read out of the 5 books. If like I, you became bored, just go ahead and read THE HIGH KING, it stands on it's own."
4,The High King gets high marks,"The High King is a book about an assistant pig-keeper named Taran who is living a peaceful life on a farm ... Until the wounded prince Gwydion turns up without the magical sword Drnwyn, that the kings of Prydain wear. Taran assists the prince on his quest to reclaim the sword Dyrnwyn from the Arawn Death-Lord and his army.It has a lot of battles, armys, magic, and death. This book would be right up a boy's alley. This book is easy for 4+ grades.This book has a bit of talking and romance, but, it's still an awesome book."
2,It Might Confuse You,"Drynwyn is the most powerful weapon in Prydain. Now Taran, an assistant pig keeper during the medieval age must travel to Mount Dragon evil's strong hold. During a winter of danger Taran reaches Mount Dragon. He faces Arawn evil deathlord, and makes the most crucial desicion of his life.This book wasn't a very good novel. It was a little violent and the names are confusing. Like the name Eilonwy is a diffucult name to say. This book is confusing unless you read the other books in the series. (The Prydain Chronicles) They don't descibe the setting of characters in the book. They just jump right into the story where it left off from the other book. This book is a little like The Hobbit, by J.R.R Tolkien. I like The Hobbit a lot better. The Hobbit was easier to follow and was very well written. I sugjest that you read the other books first. This wasn't one of his best written books. That is why I rated it like I did."
2,No clickable able of contents,"As mentioned above this book is pretty much useless on Kindke because it is so hard to navigate. However, it's got lots of good stuff in it."
5,my winter running shoes,"I got these shoes to run in during the New England winter. They keep my feet dry, which is just what I wanted."
4,Emergency ID Bracelet,I purchased this item through Amazon after my Doctor told me I should start wearing one. This item was delivered with in the promised time frame. It is a fine quality piece for the price I paid and serves my purposes. The only complaint I have is that because of the latch design I need help putting it on.
2,Clasp doesn't stay closed,"The bracelet is attractive, but, the Clasp doesn't stay closed which is annoying to my mother.[[ASIN:B0000532P6 Apothecary Diabetic ID Bracelet]"
3,Disappointed,"I bought a single Brussel's Money Tree a few months back and it arrived in good shape and I was happy with it. I ordered 2 more to give as gifts and they arrived crushed and close to being dead. Attention to detail in packing the delicate items was not there. I got a much larger, healthier, and less expensive plant at Lowe's Home Improvement. If you order one of these it is a toss of the dice. Good luck!"
1,Frozen tree,Ordered as a gift for family in Chicago.It will not be bringing any good fortune as I'm told the plant arrived frozen and nearly dead. Returned. Now waiting for refund. Waste of time and money.
2,False advertising,"True I did receive my order sooner than I expected but the plant was withered and almost dead when I received it. Also, the tree I ordered was not the tree I received. I will not order from this company again and will advise the same to all the people I know that shop on Amazon.com"
4,Two Proud Regiments,"This is a first class narrative of two very proud and successful regiments of cavalry. It is obviously well researched.The author nearly goes astray in at least two places by going off on a tangen but recovers quickly and gets back to the point. He certainly likes the word ""deprecate"" and by the end of book I wished he could have used a thesaurus. Also, he discribes their maneuvers as ""marches"" where in fact the 9th and 10th must have ridden as they were, after all, mounted soldiers.The biggest fault, in my opinion, is the very ending. What happen to these two regiments? Where they disbanded and if so, what happen to some of the major figures? This interesting story seems to come to an abrupt halt without so much as a wave goodbye."
2,Not a Biography,"I buyed, thinking was a biography and it's not!. It's a story with facts of Rav Kook life writen in a biography way but not a serious one. For a giant like Rav Kook I don't like the way the author describe his life...Rav Kook deserved more."
3,It was okay,"The story was kind of predictable, but enjoyable just the same. Not one of King's better tales."
2,Not Great,The Box it came in was torn and open. sealed with wrapping paper tape. NOT Brand New as advertised. Kinda ticked me off then taking out the net the hooks kept falling off. If i didnt Have to have it I would return it. NOT worth the money. Walmart wold have been better
4,Dissapointed,(Two Stars) The products arrived on time and i was pleased until i opened the package. The set i ordered came with a wall charger a car charger and a pair of handsfree earphones..... that weren't handsfree. They weren't retractable and that was a huge dissapointment especially since it was my very first order from this company. You can also get better deals from other companies. And now the site won't let me change my star rating it's really a two. Very dissapointing
1,Horrible Customer Service,"Bought this, and was working well for a few months. About the 4th month, started to leak, and could tell the filter wasn't working properly, due to smelling chlorine again in shower. Called Crystal Quest directly, they said they would send me out a new unit, that was over 2 months ago! Tried to work with this seller, said they would get back with me the next day - it's been over a week and still haven't heard anything back from the seller or Crystal Quest. This was really the worst customer service I've experienced. Next time would buy a different brand, just to ensure proper customer service."
5,No turning under raw edges,"I first saw Sue Nickel's on ""Simply Quilts"" with Alex Anderson, demonstrating her techniques. This method of applique looks as good as the kind you turn under the raw edges, but it takes alot less time. Sue also has a technique where you remove the inside of the fusible web so the applique isn't so hard. If you want a book on all kinds of applique techniques, then I would recommend Harriet Hargrave's ""Mastering Machine Applique"". I like Sue's approach to applique the best."
3,average,"Rowenta steamer is not ironing device, it is for quick touch up on clothes that were already ironed/drycleaned. When dealing with cotton, I presteem clothes with Rowenta and then iron. Ironing goes this way quickly and I don't hate it! It is true that it is sometimes cumbersome to handle and stretch the fabric so no wrinkles are achieved. The best results are produced on silk, polyester, wrinkle free materials. IT is easy to steam tablecloth, curtains. It is pretty primitive tool, not much engineering went to this design.My biggest complaint about this product is SMELL! Even when this steamer is not on, it stinks the room. There must be some terrible plastic on it that emits these noxious fumes. I just hope there are not toxic. I put steamer in room where nobody sleeps and keep windows open. This steamer is not new, we had it about 3 months and it stinks."
3,"ok, but poor workmanship","heats up- great; hot steam; after few months, container lid slipped off - used plumbers tape; after a year, it stopped steaming - took it apart and found serious calcification. looking for new hose to repair it."
2,Steams well but poor quality machine,"I purchased this steamer for my clothing store. While it did a nice job of steaming the clothing, within less than 3 months, a large hole developed in the hose so the steamer no longer worked. At least Amazon is awesome about customer returns!"
1,What a mess!,"My steamer worked well for all of 5 mins. The pole went from upright to a 45 degree angle without hanging anything on it and would not straighten out; the defect appeared to be at the connection where the pole screws into the machine. Then within minutes I had water all over my hardwood floors. I had the same problem as other reviewers, the water tank kept leaking. So off to the returns department we went. I guess it steamed well for the five minutes that it worked? Not worth all the mess and hassle of returning it."
1,What a piece of crap,"After less than 20 uses of this steamer, it developed an unbelievably annoying beeping sound and will not heat up. The only way to stop the beep is to unplug the unit from the wall. I steam my clothes as I am getting ready for work so rarely do I have time to accommodate the 8-5 M-Friday Rowenta Customer Service gruelling schedule. When I finally get frustrated enough to call Customer Service, I was informed that the beeping is a malfunction of the auto shut off and, by the way, the unit is out of warranty. I was politely referred to the closest repair service that is located in NY and I live in GA. I paid $150 for the unit initially only to find out that I must pay to ship the unit both ways and the minimum labor charge is $75.This is, without question, my last Rowenta purchase."
4,Rowenta IS-8100 Commercial Garment Steamer,"I love this product and don't know how I lived without it. The price was good, although 've seen other brands with built in hangers which would be really helpful."
2,Good while it lasted,"I have had my steamer for a little over a year. It worked really well at first but the hose slowly started to peel and fall apart - I used it about 3-5 times per week for small garments but never for an extended amount of time. Then the steam started to go in and out and one day it just stopped. No more steam. It turns on but nothing happens. I did not use this steamer to what I would consider its capacity and treated it well(used the right water, never left it on etc...) To top it all off the Rowenta customer service has been HORRIBLE. The website is no help and I have been unable to get in touch with a human who can help me figure out how/where I can get it fixed."
3,not so much a philosopher's Kierkegaard,"this is a good collection but I think some selections from The Concept of Anxiety - which is Kierkegaard at his philosophically most sophisticated- and maybe even the Concept of Irony, would make this more interesting to philosophy students. Beside these shortcomings its a good anthology available at good prices."
3,it is okay?,it is not the best Stonewall Jackson CD.It's a CD with allot of remakes of other artist!But it does have ''Me and You and a Dog Named Boo''
1,Price is wrong,"For the price it is one of the cheapest 2gb flash drives out there, but the good news ends there. I have had mine for less than 4 months and it's already coming apart. The plastic case has separated and the circuit board inside is loose as is the metal USB adapter. All in all storage has been no problem, but if the device doesn't last I don't consider it a bargain at any price. I bought a Sandisk Cruzer and am much happier with the build quality."
3,"A for technology, F for plastic case","I like PNY. They generally make good stuff. This flash drive is fast on data transfer. But the plastic cover fell apart after about a month, and I now carry it on my key chain uncovered, filling up with lint from my pocket. I expect it to be only a matter of time before the plastic hook that connects to the key chain breaks as well, at which time I'll add it to my collection of orphan flash drives.Good technology, crappy case."
3,Lund Basic Cargo Carrier,"I did not recieved what was shown in the picture for this ad. I purchased this unit because it had extention rails, when it arrived is when I found out they were not included. It works well, but I sure could use the rails."
4,Carries all,I purchased the cargo carrier for camping gear. It's easy to put together and install. You can easily strap your gear onto the platform. There are several accessories that you can purchase to compliment the carrier such as bike racks and storage bins. The reason I didn't give a five star rating is because Lunds customer service gives you no more than lip service.
5,works perfect,This works perfect with my Overhead Door garage opener. It costs much less than the factory remote.
1,A horrid CD,"My husband played flute professionally for 45 years. I am a pianist and we have played many of the Kuhlau sonatas together. Kuhlau's music is beautiful, but this recording is on fortepiano and a 9 keyed flute. It lacks the brillance that one assosciates with the Kuhlau sonatas. We are throwing the recording in the trash.I highly recommend the complete sonata recording of Elisabeth Westenholz on Kontrapunkt."
4,"Good, but with an odd ending","This slim work actually speaks volumes, and is written in an engaging, fast-moving account that will satisfy either the Civil War buff, historian or general reader. The final chapter on Port Hudson is the only downside. That city's capture was part of the campaign described in this book, but its exclusion from the rest of this work makes it oddly out of place."
4,"Impresive design, great toy !","Just that, I like the design, great idea. The designer knows what the kids imagine, instead of just copying the reality."
2,No cc,I was unhappy to receive this DVD and find that it has no closed captioning. I have been meaning to return it because it is useless to my students without closed captioning as I have a student who is deaf.
5,Entre el danzón y la descarga,"Un oásis, una pausa y una pasión...Interesante trabajo de Andy García. Una mezcla exquisita de ritmos entre el son, la guaracha, danzón, rumba y la descarga.No debe faltar en una colección seria de quién aprecia lo que es 'verdadera música'.Cinco estrellas porque es lo máximo, pero es un 10 en todo sentido..."
2,the lost city soundtrack,Total dissapointment! When I saw the movie I immediately wanted to buy the soundtrack which was suppost to be available in 2010. When I purchased it could not believe it. The song are literaly 5 seconds long is like wetting your lips and not being able to drink the drink.
2,Didn't work for me... maybe it will for you???,"I had high hopes that bump stopper 2 would work after reading the many positive reviews, however, after 2 weeks of consistent use (morning, night and after shaving) I still had razor bumps. The appearance of the bumps may have lessened somewhat but not nearly enough.That being said, I would still recommend others to at least try it. It has potentially beneficial ingredients not commonly found in other products and everyone's skin will respond differently."
3,Just Didn't Work Enough For Me,"The product certainly made the razor bumps better, but it didn't solve my problem. I started with 200 or so bumps after a bikini wax/shaving adventure gone wrong. The look of the bumps improved by about 75% after two weeks, but that still left 50 or so bumps that didn't go away even after two weeks of putting on product. Redness decreased noticeably as well, but not enough that I would feel comfortable going to the beach.The creme is also messy if you're putting in around the bikini area...it stained some of my underwear a light tan color. That said, the subsequent container I bought had white formula (not tan), and it didn't stain, so I guess it depends on the color of the creme."
4,This stuff actually works,"I suffer from a rough bear that often get ingrown hairs. I have tried tons of products to help combat this problem and get rid of the bumps and this stuff honestly helps out big time. I'd say it gets rid of about 90% of razor bumps. You do need to use it at least once a day (twice is better) and it definitely isn't inexpensive, but does work.It obviously works because when I run out and stop using it, bumps start developing again."
4,walker,This is a large walker meant for the larger person. It was easy to put together and very easy to use. My only complaint is that the brakes give out easily and have to be adjusted regularly.
3,"Decent, But Uninspired Death Metal From Amercian Stalwarts","Immolation's last platter, ""Harnessing Ruin"", was a fantastic modern death metal album with lasting appeal, a great, thick production, and enough variety, experimentation, and sharp songwriting skill to keep you coming back over and over again, setting a high bar and higher expectations for the next release. Unfortunately, ""Shadows In The Light"" seems like a misstep.Suffering from a poor production, somewhat uninspired riffing and songwriting, and an over ""flat"", somewhat boring vibe, this album was certainly a letdown after their last effort, which I thought was absolutely fantastic. Still a decent album in the genre, it just feels to me like they are simply going through the motions. That, + lackluster production values, = a forgettable metal album."
5,Roller skate Wheels,I purchased these wheels for my sister for Christmas. She wanted them to have so she could switch her indoor wheels with outdoor ones. She really liked them.
3,Must like puzzles,"This set is really just a puzzle that you can play with after it is put together. So, if your older child really likes SpongeBob and puzzles, great. If not, not the toy for you. My 7 year old needed A LOT of help putting the pieces together (ok, I had to do it all), but she and her younger brother (age 5) now really enjoy playing make-believe with the assembled set. Not sure if an older child (9+) would really get any enjoyment with this set after it is put together and they are the only children capable of doing it, hmmmmmmm"
2,not worth the $,"This is a very expensive set. Personally I didn't think it was worth it. Very hard to follow instructions with very small, easy to lose pieces. Way too difficult for small children to put together. Once together it was fun too play with but still not worth the money."
3,This toy is not for a 7 year old.,"My son just wanted the playset. It had so many tiny pieces, which I did not realize from it's description. My son loves playing with Lego's and Kinex, but there is no way that this can be built exclusively by a 7 year old. I was also afraid of my younger one putting the pieces that constantly snapped off into her mouth. The recommended age is 7-10. It is definitely for the 10 year old."
4,"Works for most people, not all",This product is o.k. I have been trying to conceive for almost 2 years and starting using this product about 6 months ago. I have not gotten pregnant yet. Some months it doesn't show that I have ovulated when I clearly did.
4,Easy to Use; Cheaper Here Than Elsewhere,These are the test sticks for the Clearblue Easy Fertility Monitor. They are quite a bit cheaper here than at our local drug store.The monitor itself is easy to use and aids in the planning involved with determining peak fertility.
4,Great product Great Price,I absolute loved this product!! Along with the monitor I feel very confident in conception. Also the price was amazing!
4,Simple to use,"These sticks are smaller then the ones that come in the box of seven. It took some time before I realized how switch the cap and insert it into the machine. If your not a morning person like myself, beware. I was almost late for work the first day I tried to use it because I was half asleep and didn't understand the diagram. THIS IS NOT THE FAULT OF THE PRODUCT! It works great once you figure it out."
1,Love the clearblue monitor but questioning this batch of test sticks!,"I love the clearblue monitor. It has been consistently reliable for me and I used it successfully to conceive my son. Once I bought these test sticks off Amazon, however, the monitor isn't working properly anymore. I'm backing up my ovulation tracking with OPKs I bought at the drug store and despite the fact that they are showing an LH surge, the monitor isn't. This has never happened to me before. The ovulation tests from the drug store always coincide with the monitor. My cycle is so reliable and the monitor has been so reliable in the past that I suspect something is wrong with these sticks I bought off Amazon. I will not be using them next month. I will be buying a new box from another vendor."
2,problem,"I have used this product for a few months. The first several boxes of testing sticks worked fine. The last box I purchased did not. There is an area on the stick that is supposed to show blue, after urinating. About 20 of the 30 sticks did not do so in this box. Now the accuracy of my monitor is incorrect, because it is not reading several of the sticks. I feel like that particular box was a waste of money, and has hindered the rest of my monitoring. I have no problem with this product, just this particular box of testing sticks!"
5,Fertility monitor sticks,Product arrived quickly and discreetly. Packaging was also great. Plus I got a better price here than anywhere else.
5,Great Buy!!,I've looked for the Andromeda cd everywhere & I finally found & I'm very pleased with its content. Andromeda sounds very different from Luces. Luis' voice sounds beautiful & I recommend this cd to anyone who likes spanish rock!
4,Great!,"I must say this is the best CD because I have been looking for a wonderful CD to remember the good old days. The quality is wonderful, I could not ask for anything better."
1,not PC friendly,Not only is it a bad game according to others you have to have a new and well equipped computer to even be able to load it. It requires a fast system and unfortunatley we dont have that. Now we are stuck with a game we cant play on our computer.
1,unlike any pc game,this review is for pc versionbasically the game lacked any customization.but my biggest problem with this game is its camera system.You don't have free third person camera. The game is only top view similiar to RTS games.There are a lot of things missing in this game1- camera is not what used to be ( previous harry potter games had mouse/camera free movement).2- no mouse support3- no video settings4- no audio settings5- no key reassignment.
1,"Don't be fooled by the ""PC"" version !","Don't buy this game! You will be sorely disappointed. This is NOT a PC game, it's a Gamecube/etc. game that's been poorly ported over to the PC. You can't use a mouse! Let me repeat: this is a PC game in which you cannot use a mouse!I am livid with anger at having wasted my money on this. Nowhere on EA's site was there any mention of this--I HAVE a GameCube and thought that, as with the previous HP games, the experience of playing this one with my son would be better on the PC. I've been taken!I am sure that this game is fun on the platform for which it was obviously intended--but I am not about to waste my time pecking around on my keyboard to control movement when the game is so obviously designed for a Playstation or Gamecube controller.I cannot believe that EA would stoop so low. Actually, yes I can."
3,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"This game is ok, but its not in the same format as the 5th and 6th games. This game is seperated into sections. And you have to find a certain amount of sheilds to open the next section, or complete the task (like the ones from the movie) to be able to move on. But it was kind-of fun"
3,Fun but difficult,"This game was not horrible, but it certainly wasn't the best HP game yet (that was the third one). I liked how unique it was after the first three being so similar. The graphics are great and it is very fast-paced. I thought it was weird though because everytime you think you beat a level it turns out you didn't. What I did not like is how difficult it was. I just couldn't beat it. The last task was ridiculously hard so I never beat it but the rest of the game was fun. A plus is the awesome graphics, for sure! Plus you get to choose who you want to be. I admit three players gets confusing but some reviewers seem to have found a way to play with multiple people, though it sounds fun I'm not sure how that would work. Anyways if you liked all the other hp games you should try this one, even if it isn't the best one it wasn't so bad."
1,The worst. Period.,"I LOVED the first four (SS, CoS, TPoA, and QWC) games.The first one was a little too easy (I beat it in three days after some practice), the second one being a bit too hard (I have a fear of fire snails), the Third one and Quiddich World Cup being perfect.When I bought the first game I was expecting another GREAT game. But here is what I got: graphics that were grainy, NO exploring, and no fun trunks with goodies. it was a HARD game, and i'm still stuck on the second task. I can't believe I decided to buy PetVet later because I wanted this. Here's hoping you can explore in the fifth one.~a very angry horsewhisperer360>:("
2,Very dissapointing,"I was soo excited to recieve it for christmas, but it is not worth it. You have all the challenges laid out infront of you, the view is awful, and you dont get to explore, it is all action!! I like the way you can choose whether you want a charm, jinx or accio, but other than that and the amazing graphics, it is pointless. To get some of the shields no one taught you how/what to jinx to get it!! No one teaches you the spells, you need to figure them out yourself. I think the third game was the best and that EA games should use it as a template for the fifth game. The fourth is fun, but aquard"
2,Obviously not designed for PC gamers,"I am only at the second level of this game but have to confirm what other reviewers mentioned before: Getting the characters to go where you want them to go is a challenge and the fact that you cannot change the camera angle makes it even more difficult. You cannot choose what spells to cast and when you cast, aiming is a problem because the characters are so hard to control.Oh well... what did I expect... This is just another moneymaker in the Harry Potter Franchise, not a game designed by people who enjoy the books and try to bring them to life!"
5,Excellent,"Always good to hear and experience the other side's story, there should be more books like this. Makes one realize the futility of war."
3,A Perfect Red,"The book is very interesting and well written; however, I was disappointed to note that the e-book version of this book is missing the figure illustrations."
3,"Interesting, unusual wide-ranging book","Wide-ranging look at nations' quest for ""the perfect red,"" and the immense impact that a simple INSECT can have on an entire nation's econmy.Good intertwining examinations of the parallel stories of the economy, empire, espionage, piracy, trade, labor conditions (including slavery), racism, the ""old"" and ""new"" worlds, etc. Lots of good detail about the personalities involved and the twists and turns as researchers tried to discover the source of the ""perfect red"" at the heart of Spain's economy.Fun aside: While you're reading the book, you find yourself noticing colors more. The book gives you an increased appreciation for the use of color in everyday life and a gratitude that in contemporary times everyone can afford colors of every hue, as opposed to centuries past when certain colors were only for the royals or other upper classes."
4,"""When The Devil Holds The Candle""",Good detective story. Place setting is Norway and it becomes apparent as you read. It is hard to figure out what has happened until close to the end. Good read for summer reading.
4,Adds nice flavor,"This is a nice product. It doesn't perfectly flavor coffee, but it does add a nice little touch. Definitely worth 4 stars."
4,Elemental Desires,I loved the vairous stories. Each story using the elements in a whole new hot way. Each story is a page turner and so hot.
2,This is ASTERIX???,"I think this is as LOW as Asterix has ever gotten. Come on, Uderzo has simply lost his touch and does not have the same magic as Goscinny. The previous Asterix books were just amazing, but this is just a PATHETIC excuse for an Asterix book. The storyline is weak(ever hear of using an impersonator just to get a helmet and sword? -ridiculous), and the flavor of humor is simply missing, although the old magic is displayed in some instances in the book. However, the drawings are still as good as the old ones, but that cannot save this Asterix from being a flop. I just hope that Uderzo can leave asterix in peace and finish the Great series before damaging its reputation any further."
2,Very disappointed,I was very disappointed in this product. I listened to it faithfully and even more than was recommended. I saw no difference at all. I just gave it two stars because it helped me fall asleep.
5,H. Robbins's first..,"Great writer, great book. There are however several spelling mistakes in the eBook. A company like Amazon should be more carefull."
4,Strong debut.,"It's been said that while working for Universal Pictures, Harold Robbins didn't like the movies they produced and made a bet that he could write a novel that was better than the ones Universal bought the movie rights for. If the story is true, the result was this, his first novel. And if the story is true, I'd say he did a good job. In ""Never Love a Stranger"", Robbins proves he can do more than write sex scenes. He's created some strong chracters, especially the hero, Francis Kane, and a very involving story. Definitely recommended. Strong 4 star rating.The book was also made into a movie starring John Drew Barrymore and Steve McQueen, seeNever Love a Stranger."
4,Good Book,"This is a good book all the way through. IT is very cool becuase when you read it, it seems as if you are really in this magical story. If you like magic, and funny stories, I would definitely reccomend this book to you."
3,A chance to change,"I haven't read the other books in the Magic Shop series, but I found this tale quite enthralling. Charlie, a 6th-grader and habitual liar, acquires a magical skull that causes him to be unable to lie. His family is affected by this, as well as his friends, and later other members of their community. It's a poignant tale of learning the power of truth and learning to deal with its consequences. There are serious topics in this book (cancer, homosexuality, environmental protection), and it's all handled clearly and positively. I certainly recommend it to adventurous younger readers, as well as older readers wishing to reminisce about those magical, younger days."
3,Good for basic work,"Being the only female at a lumber yard, I bought these to be slightly more feminine, but not so much that the guys make fun of my ""girly gloves.""I like their looks and they are comfortable.However, after just a few weeks of use, the leather palm started to come undone. I'm going to attempt to sew it back on, but I was disappointed that this brand would fall apart so soon.If you just want them for gardening or basic home-type work, they're great. But not for any kind of tougher work."
4,Fit great,I like these gloves a lot but if you're working outside in the winter you will want something with insulation inside
2,New version isn't very durable,"I had a green pair of these that lasted through some pretty serious stuff....the red and blue ones only last through a couple of weekends of regular gardening. The fingers wear through or the seams rip on the finger tips. I bought the leather ones and they lasted a bit longer but after a month or so they even wore through at the tips. I do have long nails but, I had long nails when I used the green pair...which was only retired because I sliced through them with a blade by accident, but the gloves saved my skin. Too bad the gloves were irriplacable :("
5,Worked for Me!,"I bought this monitor after trying over a year and a half to get pregnant. I have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and I got it after about 6 months of Glucophage treatment for the PCOS. I got pregnant the first cycle. It turns it I was ovulating later than I thought I was by doing the temperature chart alone. Even though Clearplan site says it is not accurate for PCOS people I believe it made the difference for me. I know it may seem like a lot of money, but for me it was worth it. I figured if it didn't work the money was well spent anyway. The first month it just seemed like we had sex every day starting about 2-3 days after my period ended for about 20 days in a row. Also, the waiting at least 15 minutes with your hips elevated after sex. Good luck to all of you who are trying!"
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased this product after reading the numerous positive reviews. I have to say that I am very disappointed, however, because the product does not function properly. It appears to calculate the number of days in my cycle properly but has displayed an error message every time I am supposed to perform a test. The machine keeps saying that the testing slot is not ready. I have addressed the issue with the manufacturer, and they are not sure what the problem is. Because this is not returnable to Amazon (even though I have never performed a test of any kind with it), I am stuck shipping the monitor off to the manufacturer and hoping it can be repaired. Because Amazon will not accept these returns and the price is so high, I would recommend purchasing somewhere where you have a seller to work with if there is a problem. Hopefully, mine can be fixed or replaced, but I have not had any luck yet."
2,NOT Entirely accurate,"I had been using 2 of these same exact monitors for over a year. Why 2? Well I wanted to see if it really worked...I would use both at the same exact time and followed the directions to a ""T"" and would get different results on both machines. So after getting different results numerous times I did an experiment...When it would say I was on the second high day or first ovulation day the next morning I would wet the stick with water instead of urine and according to the machine it would say I was ovulating. It automatically will say you are ovulating 2 days in a row whether you are or not! You hear all these stories about how it worked for the person on the first try well maybe it did but I am not convinced. Most people I have heard of who bought this had already been trying for a while before then so I think it is more a matter of that was just by coincidence the lucky month. But who knows. I just do not ""buy it""."
3,"Good product, but no guarantee","This product will help identify when you are ready to ovulate, but it did not improve my odds of conceiving. I tried to conceive for 3 months using this product and it predicted ovulation each of those months. (I tried 3 months before that w/o the product with no success.) The monitor's predicted period of ovulation coincided with physical signs, so it seems accurate. It showed me that I ovulate at different times each cycle. So far, I have not conceived even though my husband and I are otherwise healthy and conceived our first child with nothing other than sheer dumb luck the first month of haphazardly planned intercourse.I am going to continue trying and I am glad I purchased this product, but just because you have intercourse while this machine indicates peak fertility, it does not guarantee success."
5,Clearblue Easy Monitor,"I'm irregular and my cycle is all over the place. I just started using this month.....will see what happens. Overall, the monitor is is easy to use."
2,Annoying,I was hoping this was going to help me succeed in getting pregnant. I started it the day of my cycle and had one low day of fertility and 19 days of high fertility without a peak... egh!! very disappointed with the product and would recommend saving your money.
2,fertility monitor,"I am so disappointed that after spending a whooping sum of money to buy this product, it is faulty and i don't know how to locate amazon.com to file in my complaint. the aim is defeated so far."
2,Machine stopped working the first month!!!,"After 'winging it' for several months and taking my temperature for one month I decided to buy this product. I was very excited to use it. Everything was going along just fine for days 1 through 16 (a peak day). I wake up on day 17 (Christmas Day) to find the machine is still stuck on day 16. Couldn't believe it...of all the days. I wake up on day 18, the machine finally advances a day, but it's still a day behind. I was extremely disappointed considering the cost of this product. The helpline offered nothing, but advised me to stop using it and start over at the beginning of my next cycle. Like another poster stated, don't put all your eggs in one basket."
3,Expensive and Unhelpful,"So when we decided to try to conceive I bought both this fertility monitor and the ClearBlue Easy Ovulation test. I must say the ovulation test was more straightforward and easier to act on than the monitor. The monitor would just give day after day of highs and no peaks, it would give me highs when the ovulation test showed I was peaking. The ovulation test always gave a smiley face. I actually decided to just ignore the monitor and just follow the ovulation test and I'm glad I did. We're pregnant! I don't think the monitor adjusted to the fact my cycle is short and varies in length. Whereas the ovulation test didn't seem to have that problem. So I would definitely recommend getting the ovulation test first and trying that out before getting the expensive monitor."
2,BEWARE: Product not as pictured,"I needed some photographic dust removal hand brushes, I ordered this item on a whim based upon looking at its photo. Note the photo shows TWO brushes with a hand loop and the title reflects the plural sense of brushes as well. What I received from Adorama was a SINGLE brush which looks nothing like the two pictured. This is a small brush which has no hand loop handle, it is simply just a peg of a handle. Would not have bought this single small brush at this price--the company is the same as mentioned in the title, and the model number is the same as listed in the product page, but it is a completely different item than what is pictured. Contacted Adorama about the problem: never received a reply. BEWARE."
2,Stopped working after 3 weeks,"The cushion worked well to start with, the high setting gets very warm, almost too warm. Not that comfortable to sit on, moves around no matter what you do. If you in drivers seat must run cord under seat to power supply. Stopped working after 3 weeks. Amazon replaced free. I would not buy again. But would you expect for 18.00 ?"
4,"So far, so good.","First month and it's great.. warms up quickly and feels great. I've only had it one month, so the question is ""how long will it function?"""
5,Wagan 12V Heated Seat Cushion,This is perfect. I looked a long time to find a heated seat that did not include vibration.Wagan 12V Heated Seat Cushion
4,Nice Bun Warmer for the Price,"The recent cold snap in the northeast has me sorry I got leather seats without the heating option. This is the next best thing for the price. Heats up pretty fast, but doesn't stay in place very well."
4,Satisfied,"I bought this heated seat cushion because the heated seat in my car broke. For the $16 I spent on the cushion I am extremely satisfied with it. It has two different heat settings; low or high, and it heats up quickly. It obviously isn't as good as my actual heated seat was, but I am still very pleased with it. It is great for those cold New York nights. Highly recommended!"
2,you get what you pay for,"If you don't sit on it, or plug it in, it will last forever. However, if you use it, it may crap out in a matter of minutes or days. Trying to find a quality heated cushion is nearly impossible, and this product is no exception. Some have had luck with it, alas I did not."
1,Terrible and cheap,This piece of junk stopped working after about 3 weeks. The straps are cheap too. Two of them broke on me. I do not recommend buying this piece of crap. Save your hard earned money.
4,heated seats,"It's great! Have had most of a month; no problems with straps, but it does bunch up. Getting soft in my old age; two days, and I was spoiled. Don't want to go back to non-heated seats..."
3,Mixed Blessing,"The seat does get hot quickly, which is the good part. However, as mentioned by other reviewers, the elastic bands fastening the seat to your car seat break easily, so the cusion can start to get bunched up and will not hold its shape well. Finally as another reviewer mentioned, this WILL drain your battery if you leave it on... nice idea and price, but watch the limitations."
3,hot seat!,"Okay for the price. Does the job keeping my wife warm, who is always colder than me in the car and trying to make the heater higher. Wish it had more than two settings, as it does get pretty hot."
3,"good, for the price",Wagan Heated Seat Cushion. Heats up fast and well. Doesn't secure to the car seat that well.----Requires adjustment of cushion prior to each use. VERY GLAD TO OWN IT-----MAKES LIVE'NG THROUGH A BITTER WINTER BETTER.
4,Inexpensive but good,"I purchased (2), one for my daughter's Honda Accord and one for myHonda Element and they performed flawlessly. Heat output good & quick.The elastic bands are a little flimsy, but it went on The Element withno problem at all, but was a liitle snug for the Accord seat, so my wifesewed in a 3 inch extension and now it functions well. I am amazed thatit works so well for the price. You do not have to worry about drainingthe battery if you own a newer model car with a power outlet, because power is shut off when the ignition key is turned off. You will have tounplug it if you own an older model with a cigarette lighter outlet.I definitely recommend this product."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CAR SEAT CUSHION ONLINE!!!,"The seat cushion I bought from Amazon before Christmas 2009 stopped working after one month, just soon after the return window expired. Now I read more other buyers' complaints, I realized this thing could malfunction and could become fire hazard. DO NOT purchase online since you'll waste your money for sure and can't return."
1,"Worked well, then broke - twice","I recently bought a second seat heater because the first one I got worked well, but then stopped working. The instant heat is great on the really cold mornings. The price is good. Hopefully this time it will work more than the 2-3 months of use that we got out of the first one. The item has a few drawbacks besides, like cheap straps and fasteners, but is what you would expect for the price. Update: my hope was dashed on the rocks of shoddy workmanship. The second one didn't last as long as the first. I won't be purchasing another: twice burned, thrice shy."
4,Wagan Heated seat cushion,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for myself...and I LOVE it. I wish it had a better design for staying on the seat, but honestly the thing does what it is supposed to do...heats up quickly and makes a huge difference in my automobile comfort on cold days. I especially like how warm it gets on the high setting."
1,Avoid the Wagan 12V heated seat cushion.,"AVOID THIS ITEM:During the time it works (if it does at all) it works very well. The first one I purchased lasted for 2 1/2 MN winters, not at all near as long as it should have but long enough to convince me to purchase another when I was unable to find any other suitable replacement.The second one I purchased lasted less than 3 weeks.BE AWARE OF REFUND REQUIREMENTS:Amazon only provides refunds within 1 month of purchase.If you do not time the return accordingly, or your cushion fails two days after the deadline, you will be given only a partial refund or no refund at all- REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT YOU WERE SOLD A DEFECTIVE ITEM."
1,Won't try for 3!,"I purchased this same seat warmer last year, it lasted a week. I called to return it and that went no where. It was directly from Sears last year. This year's model is the same. It has a faulty switch and won't work on high. It worked well for about 3 weeks. I am not at all impressed."
4,Third one purchased,"Tried one of these in my 1986 Isuzu Trooper the morning it was 6 degrees in Utah. Made the old clunker feel like a BMW. I then purchased another one for my son's 1997 Subaru Impreza and another for my husband's 1987 Ford F-150. We are all thrilled with the results. Seat cover installs best onto bucket seats. I attached a large ""UNPLUG ME...or else"" sign on each. If left plugged in, it will slowly drain your battery. Only thing that would be better is stronger ties to attach the under the seat. However, the price is great and I can always attach an old shoelace to serve as ties."
2,Not a good product.,"I bouth those at a local staples and after few weeks of use with SKYPE I decided it was a waste of money. Just like other reviewers mention the microphone volume is very low, many times i have to repeat or shout into the microphone for others to hear anything and the earpease even though it feels confortable at first after waring it for about 10 minutes you get a feeling like your ear is goning to fall aff.Stay away from this product. Good luck to all."
1,Microphone volume tooooo low,"Just don't buy it, waste of money, microphone volume too low. First i thought its a software issue, but now reading every one's review its a hardware flaw."
1,Unsuitable for Dragon voice recognition,"I bought this headset to use with Dragon Naturally Speaking 11. Unfortunately the quality is so poor that it fails to function, as reported by DNS in the setup process. I bought the Andrea NC-181-VM USB instead, and it is excellent."
3,Not my favorite Artemis Tip,"The shape is a bit of a hinderance here, althought the coarseness is a plus. I like the Power Tip, which is a larger tip and coarse -similar to this tip, but that one is less likely to roll off your foot with the spinning action of the tool. The only other plus I'll give this particular file head is that if you have a dexterity problem, this might help aid you better than any other heads offered for the Artemis product (my husband uses mine occassionally and offered this good bit of info)."
5,Saddle the Wind,"Excellent DVD !!!! Sous-titres en franais, comme promis !!!! Je suis enchantée de mon achat!!!! MERCI à l'excellent vendeur dont l'envoi fut rapide!!!Christiane"
3,Needed editing,"This 800 page tome is book 4 of the Earth's Children series that I'm reading this summer, and I was delighted yet again to be reading it on my nook and giving my wrists a break. This has to be my least fave book of the series so far. The so-called traveling book, there is much repetition and lots and lots of pages on the flora that could have used some editing. On the plus side, I did learn more about Mammoth sex! I have 2 more books in the series and will get to them after I've had a bit of a breather."
3,boring,I LOVE the earths children series but i find this book the Most boring book of the earth children series
4,It makes you want more.,"This book,although not at the level of her Cave book,certainly leaves you longing for more.But the power of the book comes more from the earlier books in the seires than from the book itself.Since Auel has built such a wonderfull,rich world,it is very easy to get ""into"" that book.It is like coming home.However,I am dissatisfied with a lack of plot in the first part of the book and with many open threads left at the end. I was thrilled to find out nomber 5 is in it's way,but I would love to hear some solid news on that book. ..."
3,A great book but ....,A great book but not up to Auel's usual standard. This book is a bit too winding for me. I think there is only so much of ice age fauna and flora I want to know about! however as a conitnuation of Ayla and Jondalar's story it is a good book. I'm looking forward to the fith book though. The ending of this one is definitely a cliff hanger!
2,"Misspelling in Kindle's ""Plains of Passage""","I have read and reread the series. When I purchased it for my Kindle, I was disappointed with misspelled words. Not just misspelling, but some words were completely typed wrong. For instance, in places the pronoun I was a ? and in others cases, it was even worse. If I were not rereading, I would not have figured out some of the words.Loretta Clark"
4,I love this book and can't wait for the fith book.,"The book is intresting and I plan To read it a second time time to catch up with the four times I've read the other books. It is intense on adventure as it is on facts. Jean must be proud, and I hope she hurries with the fith book."
1,This series of books gets worse and worse...,"The First book, ""clan of the Cave Bear"" was intriguing. By the time you get to the fourth, ""Plains of Passage"", you are wondering, when this book will pass to an end. It is the same material, repeated over and over, and over and over, and over and over. I skipped several pages at a time, and didn't miss a step. The sex scenes (and there is one every few pages) seems like the same, not even reheated. It's almost as if Ms. Auel knew that people would be skipping over this material, and felt that if she repeated the same thing over again, not many would notice. If you feel like I have made my point several times in this short review, then, well, you get a flavour for the book!I hope ""Shelters of Stone"" is better."
4,The Plains of Passage,"In her continuing fascinating - and sometimes brilliant - exposition of Man's development, Jean Auel does not disappoint.The frontispiece map is helpful, but needs to be supplemented with a topographic map of Europe for a full appreciation of the massive geographical and geological research that went into this book. Those interested in Ice Age zoology and/or healing plant lore will also find much here. The author's effort to make each book of the ""Earth's Children"" series stand alone leads to some neccessary flashbacks and rehashing, but she does it well. On the down side, there are too many overly-explicit and repetitive sex scenes - enough already! That said, this is a worthwhile and very readable addition to the series."
2,Excruciatingly Repetitive,"Don't get me wrong, this book, like all of this series is entertaining. I just wish the author could cut down on the constant repetition. Also is it really necessary to completely describe every bush, tree and rock and how they associate with every other bush, tree and rock? The story carries pretty well until the end which ends quite quickly compared to the rest of the book. I still await the next book but hope Jean Auel listens to her readers and addresses the most common complaint of repetition."
2,Where did she get this from?,"Like most of the people that have written the previous reviews, I read all of Auel's books. And, where was this going? I found myself forgeting whole sections of the book because it was so BORING! I have to admit that many of the other ones were pretty drawn out as well, but atleast they kept you reading. This is a book I would recommend not to buy. But, honestly, if Auel wrote another one I would probably read it. So, Auel, make them better, will ya!"
4,Ayla is the original 90s woman.,Ayla is the original 90s woman. She can bring home the mammoth and fry is up in the gourd. I found myself wanting to to remember all the survival techniques. The tale becomes a a little soap opera-y but is definitely worth a read.
2,Read it for the sake of completeness,"The first book of the series was brilliant, full of power and imagination -it's quite impossible not to get hooked. Unfortunately all the following volumes decrease in quality and I finished Plains of Passage just for the sake of completeness. If the next book doesn't improve significantly the whole story might some day just be remebered as a fairly cheap ""sex-amongst-the-cavemen-saga"", which happened to have a good start."
2,The last half isn't too bad....,"The Plains of Passage is the weakest of the first four Earth's Children books. The first third of the book consists of sex, review, more sex, eco-lecture, still more sex. Please don't misunderstand: I am all about whatever moves the story along but there is no plot to the first half of the book and the only real action is between the furs. Ms. Auel has set Ayla as the archetype of the creative, inventive, progressive Cro-Magnon, but she has made Jondalar a caricature of the sex-obsessed, self-absorbed, take-charge-when-he-hasn't-a-clue macho caveman. It's a good thing she gave him a horse because after all of that, I doubt he could walk.Even in the second half, the narrative drags along. The frequent five-page geological history lessons begin to pall quickly and the constant rehash of the previous books reads like filler material. If you've read the series up to this point by all means check this one out from your local library and skip the first half."
2,no pleasures here,"Jean Auel has done it again...written the same book for the fourth time.I know books in a series usually begin with exposition detailing key developments from the preceding episodes, but come on. I KNOW how Ayla controls her horse with subtle body movements, I KNOW that shamans ""speak with a shadow on the tongue"", that Ayla believes babies come from a mans essence, and how she raised horses, wolves and lions. Yeah, yeah, you were marked by the cave lion, never knew your own people, and are terrified by earthquakes. We KNOW. So sorry you had a bad trip with Creb, Ayla, but do we need to hear about it every damn time you meet a new mog ur or mamutoi?In fact I am 1/2 way through the book with little more than incidents repeated (often verbatim) from all the previous books. Ayla and Jondular are the party guests who just keep telling the same anecdotes over and over. The story might be interesting the 1st time but it gets old really fast."
2,Spellbound Reader,"""The Plains of Passage"" has been read twice plus I am now listening to an Audiotape. I have read every book in the series. Hands down, Ms Auel is a marvelous story teller. Her research is impeccably woven into the storyline which brings the whole series alive and her characters believable. Am anxiously awaiting her next book. Up until these books, my favorite book was Margaret Mitchell's ""Gone With the Wind."""
3,"Enjoyable plot when there, WAY too much description","I enjoyed the first three books, even though I was slightly frustrated by the amount of time spent on describing the landscape. This book is practically nothing BUT landscape. I like the characters and enjoyed the storyline (when it was there), but I really couldn't care less about how the glacier came to be or how many different types of trees grow next to the river. There were pages at a time when not a single word was spoken; it was all description. This book would be much better if it was about 200 pages shorter. I wish someone had warned me that this book reads like an Earth Science textbook."
1,another dead end,"william scott's ability times, which are the meat and potatoes of this book don't work to get you profits if you follow the books method of handicappingsurprisingly his ""ability times"" have found their way into popular software and are often mentioned. to be honest they are just mumbo jumbo with numbers.i don't know how mr. scott remains popular in the handicapping world as his information is worthless if applied in betting on horses."
4,Hold mic well in place,"This is obviously a necessary item if you want to attach this to a microphone stand. It holds great and keeps the microphone snug into palce. However, The gap for the cable to fit through should be a bit bigger, as well as the tail-end of the grip; because if you have a certain kind of XLR adapter that is wider than the microphone, you won't be able to take the microphone out of the grip without disconnecting the XLR adapter first."
3,It's Alright!,"This microphone clip becomes loose at the hinge very quickly, and needs to consistently be tightened. Too much of a hassle, really~"
5,A fun CD from an exciting artist,Especially for anyone who has had the pleasure of seeing her in a live perfromance - you will enjoy this wonderful CD even more.
2,"Great idea, but poor quality","When I first bought these I thought ""These are great, easy to install"" however the very next day after installing them the mesh screen that is on the top side, came off. At first I thought the whole thing popped off, but it was just the screen. The worst part is this happened when there was no rain or wind. So I am skeptable about what will happen in bad weather. Very disappointing. Especially since I bought and installed 300ft. of them. :-("
5,Oh My Gooodnesssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!,.....NOW...FOR THOSE WHO HAVE READ MY REVIEWS KNOW THAT I HAVE A LOT TO SAY...AND EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A SINGLE...ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT THIS SONG IS INFECTIOUS.....THE BOI HAS MAD SONG WRITING SKILLS....
2,Looks Great but Clogs too often for me,"I had this unit for over 2 months and used it almost daily. I'm not a coffee snob and I found the espresso it produced to be fine for my needs.What I found problematic was the errant coffee granule that would block that tiny hole in the portafilter even after I cleaned the portafilter and poked and poked that tiny little hole in the filter basket with the needle tool supplied with the unit for that express purpose.The mess that was created when trying to pull a shot and nothing would come out got to be too much for me even though it was infrequent, By the way,I am fully familiar with the grind level and tamping needed to make this unit perform as was intended by the manufacturer.So I returned it and was fortunate to get the second to last in stock Gaggia Classic here at Amazon. Wow!, What a difference. Better taste, better crema, tons of micro foam and no wet puck or clogged porta filter."
2,"lights are on, but no one's home","Beautiful machine, heavy, seems like it would be durable. Makes a nice espresso with everything you'd expect. At least, WHEN THE MACHINE WORKS. I'm on my third machine. First one, heater quit working after 9 months. Second one (their replacement), heater quit working after only 3 months. They replaced the third one with an upgrade to the BES 820XL model (programmable). It never worked - broken pump out of the box. Past 90 days with Amazon, so can't get $ back there and MAKE NOTE: If you don't purchase the machine directly from Breville, they can't give you your money back, only an endless game of 'replace the machine'. Hey, it keeps UPS in business at least. I know people who love their machine...lucky them, it's still working."
1,Broken twice. CHEAP PLASTIC PARTS. AVOID,"We registered for this for our wedding about 4 years ago. We use it about 10 times a week for cappuccino. The Espresso tastes great, but we've had to bring this thing in twice to have it serviced. The net net is: the insides are made of plastic parts which break under the stress of regular use. What a drag.I'm sticking with my 20$ italian oven top espresso maker. Makes perfect coffee, no parts to break and no $300 worth of service on the machine. 0 counter space taken up."
5,Great Service Breville,Mine broke on the wand but breville after 6months replaced the machine and upgraded it to the one with the gauge. i would get the one with the gauge as the wand is actually polished which makes cleaning a lot better. it also make better crema again thanks breville for great service
2,why did i give this 2 stars?,"i own 3 espresso machines and my favorite is my jura z-5 perfect espressos every time, ok now this one, i have actually owned it longer, i have never gotten a good pull, its been very difficult to find the correct combination of grind and compaction, too fine a grind and it plugs the filter, too much compaction and the water wont flow through, but the real surprise is the sloppy grind mess, this alone should warrant a one star rating, no espresso machine should produce this mess that spills all over your counter. i have a ugly machine i bought at target for less money and you get a nice espresso with with a moist puck. i really dont understand these great reviews. why the 2 stars then? well it looks the way an espresso maker should look, i just wish it preformed as well as it looks."
4,Vectors and tensors in engineering and physics,"It's a good-level book in tensors' algebra and calculus. Besides, physical examples help you better understand the mathematical concepts. On the other hand, I think it does not have enough applications about vector calculus (Frenet formulas, scalar potentials, Maxwell equations...).I would have also preffered it to contain more about general tensor theory: pseudotensors, curvilineal coordinates, and also about Riemann spaces. Despite this, it's an excellent book where you can see mathematics aplied to science; this is the important thing for physicist and engineers"
1,Upgraded to version 6 from 5 and had to deinstall.,"Until recently I was using version 5 and it worked great. Then I upgraded to version 6 and all of a sudden each individual file required a solid three or four seconds of my hard drive making awful noises to ""bleach"" with only a 3x overwrite. I did some research elsewhere and found that people are having all kinds of problems with this version of the product. You would do well to research yourself before you buy version 6 or upgrade to it.After what I experienced and read I got scared of this product and decided to write off the cost and de-install it. I bought a competitive product. What a disappointment."
4,Retro-Prog Avalanche of New Wave Techno Preportions!!,"Very ably straddling the line betweem between past and future, Stereolab release a double cd compiltation of recent singles which show as much reverence as innovation. Striking as much a 4AD feel as Krautrock feel they delve headlong into a new wave dance style without a sense of cliche. The sense of continuity with Dots and Loops comes from a copious selection of remixes. Despite a sense of overload (the double cd may be a bit much for novices), there is incredible sense of cohesion which strings the tracks together. Good luck keeping the tracks straight and the packaging though unique threatens the condition of the cds themselves. Indispensible and classic! Closed minded grudge types need not apply! Far too many keyboards for the guitar obssessed, though I find the guitar touches to be just as important as the dj touches. We won't even mentioned the simply divine turns from Laetitia! Essential for the Stereolab fan."
2,works great until it fails after six weeks,This product worked well until it failed after just six weeks. It was used an average of twice a day for 20 minutes per use. Disappointing that it failed so quickly.
3,"Works, but only lasted one season","I have now owned three Wagan seat-heaters, and this was the second I bought. The first wasWagan IN9738 Black 12V Heated Seat Cushionwhich worked but was flimsy and fell apart quickly. This one has a better design in terms of durability of material. BUT - it only lasted me one season, and was completely dead (light came on when plugged in but never warmed up at all) this fall after closet storage for the summer. I just boughtWagan IN9738-5 12V Heated Seat Cushion with Enhanced Durability and 3-Way Temperature Control Switchwhich seems to have durable material, much better straps, and has a 3-way switch. We'll see about the durability. I looked, and of course these only have a one-year warranty. Despite that, it's worth $20 every winter to keep my butt warm even if I have to keep buying new ones!"
4,I like this,"The seat is flimsy and doesn't stay in the correct position...the negative. However, I really do like it as it does a great job warming my back and bum :-)"
3,Worked for the season,Worked great for a season but the plug not only fell apart towards the end but it also caused the fuse to blow to the power point in the car when it fell apart.The seat cushion itself wasn't uncomfortable but it didn't secure itself to the leather seats in our 2002 Mercedes c230 coupe very well so it had to be readjusted each time we sat down.Wishing we got the heated seat option when we bought the car. :)
4,Great idea,These are great. Only caveat: wish they had an adjustable thermostat -- sometimes they are TOO good!
5,Sheer Bliss!,This cushion heats up almost instantly. Wonderful on a cold day! It is also very comfortable - no wires can be felt. A word of caution though: I left mine plugged in overnight and killed the battery in my car.
4,instant heat,"works nice in my old VW, no on-off switch, dont leave it plugged in or you'll need a jump!"
5,Cute but Over Priced,"My daughter's first reaction to it was ""COOL""! She has had it for a couple weeks now and the excitement didn't wear off. Until.....The rest of us just sat and watched my daughter mother this weird little thing. It was cool for a little while.It was great when it didn't have any new toy competition for the frist few weeks, but now a month later its a cute $50 ornament on her shelf.I don't recommend this toy anymore. I wish I could change my ratings here."
2,Read Between The Lines,"Recently I purchased a used book, Burr by Gore Vidal. I wanted the book and would have bought it without the additional information that advertised it as ""Signed"" Burr by Gore Vidal. However, I was excited to be able to add this to my library. When I got the book, I found it was signed, but by a previous owner. I imagined the seller had a good laugh on me and I resented it. I just wanted to buy a book. I didn't want to serve as anyones amusement."
3,misrepresented...,"I can't speak for the quality of this product, it seems heavy duty but have not been able to use it. I purchased this trimmer with the sole purpose of trimming 18"" prints and this product will only trim up to 12"". No where in the product description does it say what size document it will trim, I even read the product description on other sites and all it gives is the surface area measurement of 22"". I mistakenly was misled to believe that this trimmer would have no problem trimming an 18"" long document...ugh, it does NOT! Buyer beware! This picture of this product is also misleading..."
5,Great For Cutting Photos,"I have recently started printing my own photos and have found this invaluable. It has layout marks for all common picture sizes and a fence to make sure you have things lined up just right.My wife, a teacher, has also found many uses for this getting materials ready for her kids. She was very happy the day I got it.It cuts cleanly, quickly and accurately - what more could you ask for?"
2,"Apex ""Penicillin Allergy"" Necklace","Edges of this tag are not rounded, therefore they are kind of irritating. The red paint wore off quickly. I have many metal allergies. The Medic-alert symbol is attached to the tag using a rivet which is not hypoallergenic, so it caused my skin to react. I do not recommend this necklace to anyone who has sensitive skin. I had another brand of necklace (I believe it was Emerg), which lasted for years before the links in the chain separated when when it caught on something and broke."
3,"Eh, it's ok","Required to read this for Acting. I liked the imagery used in the text, but overall I thought it was self explanitory and didn't really need to read about it in a book."
5,Favorite Author,I think I have everything written by Mary Stewart--at least I try. She so vividly pictures everything for the reader that one feels one is right there in that world. I keep watching for any of her books that I might not have and any new ones.
1,Disappointing,"After endless descriptions of old rooms, and endless re-hashings of the past, this story comes to a completely unsatisfactory ending with none of the Stewart magic I've loved in the past. Ordinarily I would love such descriptions as preparation for character change or character discoveries. But It is Miss Read without the comedy. That said, in the comments to another one-star, a reader says that 50 pages of this novel were left off in some printings, whether deliberately or not she could not say. How to find these missing pages? Perhaps stuck at the back of a drawer, hidden by the nefarious Auntie. Now I have a search of my own; I get to be Kathy."
2,Rose Cottage: A novel,"Period atmosphere is OK, but the plot is predictable and the characters lack depth. Good for a rainy night, since you can read it in a few hours."
3,I'd recommend this product to family and friends. ...,"I'd recommend this product to family and friends. This product has a great whitening affect on my teeth. The flavor isn't too hot, however. I didn't care for the taste it left in my mouth."
2,Imagine my excitement upon finding a toothpaste that ...,"Imagine my excitement upon finding a toothpaste that was all natural. However, upon using it for the first time, I questioned why I ever strayed from my trusted Colgate and Crest. Saying the taste of this toothpaste was a disappointment would be an understatement. I don't know if it was the ginger or the baking soda, but this is the worst tasting toothpaste I've EVER tasted. Imagine that you have to taste someone's old wet socks: this is the only way I can describe the taste of this toothpaste. I couldn't use it more than once, because I was so disgusted. I also didn't notice that it did any better or worse than regular toothpaste in cleaning my teeth or freshening my breath. I would've liked to give it more than one try, but the taste of it was too revolting."
3,Remember Those Great Congo Church Dances?,"Sure the sound is muddy, but the equipment was primitive to say the least. These live recordings by Manhasset Long Island's own Outcasts recall the halcyon days of my own mis-spent youth. The Outcasts were featured at local church dances, (The Christ Church & The Congreational Church in Manahsset) country clubs and those great Battle of the Bands, where they duked it out againt the local compition, The Rogues, Dark-Side and The Cellar Dwellers. They even managed an appearence on the local Sunday morning show ""Sonny Fox's Wonderama"". Check this baby out especially if you were there way back in the mid sixties. Listen to Mark, Brian, Bobby, Bruce and Chuck as they cover The likes of Hey Joe, Hang On Sloopy, Gloria, Midnight Hour and Love Potion Number 9 (or was it Love Potion 69). I sure had a blast at those old church dances and this set really brings back a bundle of memories from those magical days."
2,Mr.,You sent me a used one...It's supposed to be grand new one...I couldn't believe it myself.The bottom line is that i am not happy with it...
2,my god this book is bad,"I'll have to admit I didn't finish reading this book (I hope my comparative literature instructors aren't reading this). It is boring, about four rich people spending their time doing pretty much nothing in Germany. If possible, try the Cliff's Notes.There are a few quotable quotes, giving it an extra star from me."
4,Do the Donut,The last CD before their hiatus didn't do much for me since they had departed from their rock roots. Then they somehow had a low key comeback.Haven't heard 3 sisters. Fuzz finally returns to their rock roots. These guys can still churn out some great tunes. This is the donut I loved in the nineties even though they do sound a bit tired. But recommended for anyone who likes real music and those who liked Alice Donut in the past. Smile!
2,BEST MOVIE I NEVER SAW,"Watching 'Aliens vs Predator' is like walking through a cave blindfolded. Nearly 85% of the movie is in complete darkness with only flashes of light and the other 15% is dimly lit. And if that isn't bad enough the predator blows up a power station shutting down the towns electricity. In any other movie this would be a disaster but these townfolk apparently only use 15 watt lightbulbs and the funny thing is after the electricity goes out the darkness stays the same-it doesn't get darker. Strange.From what I could see the movie is unrelenting with the aliens and the predator killing everyone in sight-men, women,children and even newborns in a hospital maternity ward.The overall movie I heard is probably worth four stars-but I gave it two stars for audio and someday maybe 20th Century Fox will release a special edition--Special because you can actually see what you're watching."
2,AVP sequel not so great,"I was really disappointed in the direction this sequel went. There was absolutely no scare factor that Aliens is known for. Nothing new that you didn't already know about Predators.If you remember from the last movie, at the end, an alien spawn burst out of a deceased Predator. Thus, an alien/Predator hybrid and made its way to Earth and attacking on humanity. Another Predator investigates and learns of a hybrid and takes off to hunt it down.That pretty much it. Humans are just in the way of the hybrid and the Predator is doing its best to track it down and kill it.Like I said, no scare factor. No build-up of suspense. The whole thing just felt rushed. Just plain disappointing."
3,avp fan really enjoyed this,wasnt to dark for me.some new adds to the story line.one made me laugh.a fun ride.dont let the bad reviews.turn you away.
2,I'll never get the time I spent watching it back...,"I absolutely adored the first movie. It was outstanding on many levels, especially the strong female lead. I had expected more of the same as far as energy, adrenaline and characters you find yourself invested in. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. It was formulaic and easily anticipated. Teenage ""B"" horror movie is a more apt description of a movie sequel that leaves you feeling hollow and awaiting the ""real"" sequel, that couldn't possibly be this one."
1,Deserves one Star for the Blue-Ray format,"I am a huge huge fan of both Aliens and Predators movies. AVP was great, but REQUIEM is really really unbearable, I just fast-forwarded to the end of the movie. Really a huge insult to any Aliens and Predators fans out-there.I give one Star for the beautiful Blue-Ray formats : the picture,the colors, the sounds were excellent ... but for the movie itself, sorry to say this, definitely one of the worst in the history of Sci-Fic movie ever made. Don't buy."
2,Requiem is an apt title for this movie has put the series to death,My title says it all. IMO this is by far the worst Alien / Predator movie. As an Alien movie fan after watching this I decided to dump my alien predator movies on ebay and forget they ever existed.
4,An okay Movie,"First off I'd like to point out that most of the reviews on here that give this film a one star are people that dont even understand the story concept of avp or take it too seriously. Now while the film has some inconsistent moments, what film does'nt?Its still an enjoyable film for those into blood and gore. Most people on here will complain that they made the film too extreme but that is the whole point of it; to take aliens vs predator to an extra level. This movie features some impressive special effects and of course an interesting take to the predalien. While character development was slow to nothing with some okay but not too bad acting, the film provides some very cool concepts for predator weaponry and a few cool fight scenes. All in all this was an impressive film to watch...not great but fun."
3,Aliens vs Predator - Requiem,"IF you love the Aliens and Predator franchises this is worth a pickup. The extras, deleted scenes and extended movie make this an enjoyable addition to your movie collection.Picking up from the end of the first AvP movie, the story leaves a little to be desired - A Predator ship crashes on Earth releasing its cargo of face huggers and a Predalien (Alien Queen that has gestated in a Predator) into the mountains. With a lone Hunter on his way to clean up the mess a human town is soon caught in the crossfire.The graphics for the Aliens and Predator are good, while the humans really only feature as fodder. Not a brilliant movie but still enjoyable and worth picking up."
3,TOO DARK!,"I love the Alien and Predator movies! I'm a huge fan of both! I have seen them all. I saw this one when it came out for Xmas in Chicago, IL. The Predator was too thin for my liking. I was looking forward to a big, mean, fighting machine. All I got was a monster that I look like I could whip!The movie was waaay to dark. My daughter and I couldn't make out the fight scenes. The actors were ok B-actors at best. If the movie had alittle more light and the Predator looked like he had a few meals before he came to earth and the actors were A-rate actors I would have giving this movie 5-stars.All in all it was a pretty good movie if you are a fan of the Alien and Predator movies.Question do anyone think that this movie may look better on BluRay?"
2,Bereft of original ideas,"There is not a single new idea here. The special effects are very good, however.[DW]"
2,Dissapointment...again,"I'm starting to think Hollywood directors aren't capable of originality anymore, or common sense. We need to work on developing characters, penning decent scripts, and stop hiding our non-creativity and laziness with tons of blood and action...but don't get me wrong, we love the action, we just want a story to go with it.The cute Laguna Beach kids, the bullies, the stupid blonde girl who can't keep her pants on. I have never in my life seen those characters 150 million times before in a movie, thank you for that. The only thing that saved this movie from being a total joke was of course, the fight scenes and the Predalien, which I thought looked really cool. At least that's one thing they usually get right, the costumes and effects. But I was bored to tears until a little bit before the Hospital scene and on which woke me up a bit.I really hate to be negative, I just want MORE. And it gets so old seeing great characters being rehashed into mediocre movies over and over again."
1,The Coup de Grace to the Series,"If you thought that the Alien and Predator franchises could not get any worse, let me introduce you to AVP: Requiem, a justifiable title considering that the dictionary definition of 'requiem' is 'a song or hymn of mourning composed or performed as a memorial to a dead person'. The inane plot, what there is of it, is reminiscent of one of those idiotic B movies of the fifties or of the more modern dead teenager flick. Though the theatrical version may have been at least watchable, the DVD version is not. The screen is so dark and dimly lit that not even frantic adjustments on your flat screen TV will make this viewable. It is like searching for treasure on the ocean floor without a flashlight. Avoid this at all costs and hope that someone will be able to revive the interesting AlienPredator storyline in the future."
1,Horrible,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There seemed to be sound bites stollen from the previous Alien movies, such as the little girl screaming sounded the same as Alien 2."
2,Wish I could have seen the movie,"This movie was pathetically dark. In some scenes, you couldn't see anything but black movements on a black background; frustrating when the scene is supposed to be crucial to the plot. Even the few daylight scenes seem poorly lighted, as if in a dream state. Once the plot settles to night and the cities power goes out, good luck trying to figure out whats going on.The plot was decent, but the fight scenes everyone buys the movie for were impossible to see :-\"
4,Excellent AVP sequel,"Yeah, this film isn't as good as the other Alien or Predator films, but it's entertaining and gives you everything you want from this franchise. The problem is that it doesn't give you what you need and that's why people are hating on it.What you need from any film is a good story and engaging characters. AVP2 has neither, but it gives fans everything you could want. It takes all the best parts of all the Alien and Predator films and blends them together in a nonsensical collage of action and one-liners. In that respect, it's really fun to watch. I also paid $2 for this Special Edition DVD so I'm not complaining about anything. This film is great."
2,Disappointed.,I had the DVD's shipped as a present only to get a call from the person I sent it too telling me that the DVD's were not all there. Seller should have done a better job to confim that the disks were included. The seller did eventually make good a mail out a new product with all the DVDs. But I had to have the person who the present was for ship the orginial box back at my cost. So at the end of the day I still ended up out of pocket plus I had the embarassment of having my friend receive an incomplete gift.
5,Another amazing Attenborough,"In this series, David Attenborough travels around the world teaching us about all of the amazing mammals on Earth, including ourselves ('Food for Thought'). Favorite parts: (spoiler alert) Attenborough says boo to a sloth, Tiger scene, skunks eating cave bats, and beavers."
2,Eh,"Im 6'1"" and after the first wash, these shirts became too short for me to wear. I ordered 3 packs and 2 were Harbor Bay, 1 was George Foreman. The George Foreman shirts held up a LOT better than the other ones."
3,A Long March over Tough Ground,"The Problem is a simple one. There are few books on the Seminole Wars available right now, and this is one of them. But to get through it you have to persevere. The subject not the writing has to be the reason you plow through these pages. Just think of a tough old sargent in a forage cap, grumbling ""close it up: keep moving,"" and you will get the idea."
4,Gets the job done,The kit is somewhat heavy to assemble alone but I managed. Some pieces did not line up perfectly but it all went together fairly easily with a ratchet set and a crescent wrench. Once assembled I installed it on a 2004 Honda Pilot with a Draw Tite Trailer Hitch (Part # 75599). I could fold up the cargo carrier without any problems; it clears the bumper easily. I did not notice any noise or rattles with it empty or loaded with cargo. The perimeter of the frame has pre-punched holes so cargo can be secured with cords/straps. I've used it once to haul camping gear and it did a fine job.
1,Canon Lens Cap Does Not Fit! Arrrrgh!,"What is Canon thinking? Buy an nice-expensive Circular Polarizer, mount it on my lens and then find the lens cap won't fit (no threads in the front of the filter). I will return this item and search for another."
4,"Sky Bluer, Water Clearer, Vegetation Less Reflective",I mainly use this when taking landscape shots where I want to either make the clouds pop or liven the sky up some (remember it works best 90 degrees from the sun.) I also put it on when shooting highly reflective vegetation or waterscapes that would otherwise cause blown-out highlights. One other little secrete is to use this when shooting waterfalls since it will allow you to shoot at slower shutter speeds thus increasing the wispy waterfall look.
2,Also Ran,"An earlier Tom Selleck movie; long winded and boring; you'll enjoy Quigley, Crossfire Trail and Monte Walsh much better."
4,Above average shoot-em-up!,"While away fighting the Civil War (Tom Sellick for the Union and Sam Elliot for the Confederacy), Sam's wife (Catherine Ross) and family are kidnapped by Confederate Raiders intent on selling them in Mexico to finance their ongoing war. Tom & Sam are reunited and off to the rescue! Good, above average western with some funny scenes, some drama, and lots of good old fashioned shooting the bad guys!"
4,Fan of westerns,"""The Shadow Riders"" is an entertaining western typical of Sam Elliott and/or Tom Selleck. If you like novels by Louis L'Amour you will like this adventure."
4,the shadow riders,Having both read the book and seen the movie I would say that this is one of the best western books I have ever read. The movie was also very good but lacked some of the information that the novel had. I would say that if you like the movie then you would almost certainly love the book.
1,cutting board,"Not so good product. The wood board cracks easily, especially at the sides. It did not last longer than four uses :("
4,Great introduction to basic aikido!,"Sensei Yoshimitsu Yamada displays great thoughfullness in explaining and illustrating basic Aikido empty-hand and weapon techniques to the uninitiated. Not much here on the philosophical foundations of Aikido, but plenty of detail on execution of techniques. Those interested in understanding the nonviolent, peaceful philosophy behind this art should check out Kisshomaru Ueshiba's ""The Spirit of Aikido"". This book by Sensei Yamada focuses on technique, displaying with exactness how the various pins, locks and throws are executed with both dramatic photographs and instructive drawings. I highly reccommend this book to anyone who wants to learn how to perform Aikido."
1,WARNING--THIS IS NOT THE TITLE YOU ARE THINKING OF....,"I too recall a wonderful hodgepodge book from my childhood filled with rhymes and folklore, but the this is NOT the same book! Mr. Bryan has written a book of hodgepodge for adults. It was published in 1986 and contains many wry observations from boring adults for boring adults. Half of which are not attributed to anyone in particular and leaves this reader wondering how much was invented by Mr. Bryan."
2,Lack of shelf life a negative for this anti-static product,"I have used the Static-Master 1"" brush for over twenty years, and been very satisfied with its performance. Until I purchased one for myself, they had all been supplied at work. When I received mine 'new' I was surprised to find that October 2010 was the 'shelf life' or 'use by' date. The radioactive component of the brush decays as it emits the alpha particles that make it so effective in eliminating static electricity from negatives. Unfortunately, there was no information online to indicate what the 'use by' date on the item was. I look carefully afterward and could not find anything. With the cost of the product, I was chagrined to find that my $ 60+ purchase was going to ""expire"" in less than 9 months.It would be more honest of the seller to indicate during the purchasing process what the shelf life of the product is. I would hope that for the price, you could get at least a year or two of use."
5,Static Master,This brush is a good for use with Digital cameras to remove dust particles off sensor when in a dusty area.
2,not varied enough,"Beautiful cards but the affirmations are not varied enough. Very repetitive and not inclusive of a variety of life situations. Gorgeous illustrations and sweet affirmations but many are very similar... could have used more diverse affirmations. See how I wrote these sentences? Four ways to say the same thing... the cards do exactly that. I prefer an inspirational book of wisdom by Taro Gold called ""Open Your Mind Open Your Life,"" in which I've found more unique, varied, and motivational spiritual wisdom."
2,Palm Zire 21,This is the worst Palm PDA that I have owned! It is too hard to read even in good lighted areas because it doesn't have a back light? All of my other Palm PDA's and my Treo 680 phone were great but this one leaves much to be desired!
4,Pretty Good Album,"Good, fun, tongue-in-cheek rock n' roll...it was a formula often repeated, but heck, it's a GREAT formula to repeat. ""I Still Think About You"" really stands out as the ballad on the album. It's a great song...and I bought the album just for it...though there are several good tracks on there."
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought this disc, because I am a fan of Andy Timmons and wanted to hear his early playing.Andy Timmons is great guitar player, but this CD is a bad example of hair metal. To me, it's sort of a cliche of what people remember of that style of music. I was a ""metal"" fan back then (still am), but this CD makes me cringe.If you are an Andy Timmons fan, you might want it, just to see where he came from."
1,Boo for Donald.,"I wasted my money and, more importantly, my time with this book. It is not about how to get rich and it really has nothing to do with the reader making money or even learning about making money. Donald literally talks...oops, brags about who he knows on every single page of the book. I was very disappointed in his efforts to give any constructive knowledge on ""how to get rich."" I agree with the other critic talking about the book.......How do you give zero stars???"
1,This book was a complete waste of money,"I have enjoyed the ""Donald's"" previous books and was able to learn a few key pointers. This book is pure garbage and looks as if it was a mish mash thrown together quickly. Go to the library or bookstore and open th book to any page and you will see."
1,How to get rich by selling yourself,"No one does a better job than ""the Donald"" on self-promotion. He'll certainly try to make you believe in his bluster by the end of the day. And that's his big secret to getting rich in a nutshell. Create a false illusion and get people to buy into it. This book was inconsistent, awkward and too self-involved to be of use to anyone seriously interested in making money. I thought I would be getting a manual of sorts and instead ended up with a name-dropping, self-stroking autobiography that half-attempts to justify ruthless and shameless business tactics. Donald Trump is also hardly self-made and for me that fact detracts from his 'acclaimed' business savvy. I would be more interested in reading accounts of his father's business ventures. The only saving grace to this book is Donald's sense of humor which makes for somewhat entertaining reading. But how to get rich? Not with this book! I guess I didn't buy into the illusion this time."
5,Be mentored by a Billionaire,"While business builders go to millionaires for advice, guess where millionaires go when they need direction? That's right! They go to a billionaire like Donald Trump.Thank you Amazon for offering this great book and thank you Donald Trump for writing it. It's an inspirition to all of us higher achievers.Great book. A must read."
1,Total BS from a celebrity buffoon,"This book will not teach you how to get rich, but it will definitely add more change to Trump's pockets. If you want to make him even richer, buy this book and then waste some more of your hard-earned cash at one of his real estate seminars that he's been doing lately. He has several partners in tow who are also snake-oil salesman, infomercial, real estate ""investors"" like Carlton Sheets, etc.His book, his seminars, and his BS Real Estate partners will pump you full of adrenalin about how to make millions, all of which is great until reality hits, and you learn, as everyone does, that wealth comes only from hard work, savings, running your own business, dedication, etc.Do yourself a favor and buy a hard-core book on real estate investing, save your money, work hard, and give yourself a chance to retire -- perhaps not rich, but in comfort. Leave buying this celebrity buffoon's book to other fools."
2,Definatly not what the title claims,"Like other reviewers, this books title is not what is found inside. It seems as though Trump wanted a way to talk about his acheivements. Just another publicity stunt. Frankly, if I would have known...I would not have wasted my money...and valuable time reading this."
1,Shallow and Empty,"I really like Donald Trump... as a person. He is charming and entertaining. But I have serious concerns about the message he is sending to Americans. We Americans seem to equate ""success"" as ""making lots of money,"" even though the ""successful"" person may be a poor citizen and morally reprehensible. There are many ways to be successful: good citizen, good craftsman, good parent, and so on. This book is little more than a collection of poorly reasoned platitudes and egocentric opinions. My advice is that you should save your money and read Aristotle instead."
4,"There's no one quite like ""The Donald"".","Trump is one-of-a-kind, and whether you love him or hate him, you can gain some valuable insight on success from reading his latest book.The book is not a ""how-to"" in the traditional step-by-step way. (This is the reason for the 4 stars. The title leads you to believe that the book will TELL you how to get rich.)No, reading ""How to Get Rich"" is more like listening to brief personal lectures from Trump on everthing from negotiating to being true to yourself. He ""talks"", you listen, and hopefully, you come away with some new knowledge on what it takes to succeed.The man is blunt, but he's also surprisingly FUNNY. I laughed out loud a couple of times while reading.If you keep an open mind, and put aside any pre-prejudices about ""The Donald"", I think you'll enjoy ""How To Get Rich.""Reviewer: Linda Painchaud"
5,"WOW! Another great book from ""The Donald""","A great read! Short and to the point chapters make this book and entertaining and educational read. The book doesn't exactly teach you how to get rich as the title conveys, but it does give you some sound advice that will point you in the right direction to make more money and to grow socially."
1,Trump How to get rich,"This book was titled how to get rich, yet, there was not one word mentioned about getting rich. The short chapters were worthless information, wisdom and advice that is common sense. The longest chapter A week in the life is nothing more then name dropping of the famous people that he associates with. I admire his accomplishment but Mr. Trump is relentless in self promotion and massaging his already over sized ego."
1,Worst Trump book... EVER..,"If you are a Trump fan, (which I was, until reading this book) you will be very disappointed with this book. The first half of the book gives some very common sense advice that can basically be summed up by; keep and open mind, stay positive, and be persistent in achieving your goals/dreams. The second half of the book was lousy. It was just name dropping and telling us whether or not he loves or hates the person.All in all, this book lacked substance. The title is very misleading, as there is absolutely no advice on ""How to Get Rich"". I believe the title was used to try and sucker people in to sell more copies."
3,Wrong Title,"This book seems to be more about how to get rich by working for Donald Trump, not oneself. That is the same thing as his show ""The Apprentice"" so you really don't need this book if you believe you can concoct a way to win the lottory or some other ridiculous get rich quick technique."
1,sweat pants,All the pants were ordered size large. What I recieved were three different sizes with lables indicating large. two of the pants were so small I had to give them away. Don't order this item you will get the shaft.
1,garbage,"This product did nothing of what the claim said it would do. It just taste bad. I would not subject this product to anyone, and for what it does it should only cost .50 to the public."
4,"Simple, straightforward, but good points","Kind of a basic look at behavioral finance. Easy too read, not very long (approx. 110 pgs). Overall a good introduction to the tendenecies people have when investing."
4,This is a great saw.,"This is my first saw with a laser. In concept it is a great idea, but in practice it is a bit gimmicky. There is nothing like watching the saw blade cut your pencil mark in half.The digital readouts are nice, a definite improvement over a scale.My unit does not swivel easily. It is binding for some reason, and I havn't had a chance to fix it.I bought the saw with Hitachi's mitre box stand, which is a great companion to the saw. Well engineered and sturdy.The saw has an annoying kick when it starts. A soft start feature should have been standard fare.My unit did not come damaged. As for adjusting things, everything I buy gets adjusted anyways. The guys putting the machinery togther are not fine craftsmen, and if you want to be a fine craftsman you need to know how to fine tune your own machinery."
4,Best book for Beginner to Intermediate,"One of the best book in the market for Chess Beginner-Intermediate level. Very well written for any level reader to understand and with exercises very well documented and explained, this is a must-have for B-I level players; when I say beginner I am talking about someone that knows to play Chess."
5,Baxter,Bought this item after watching Alton Brown on Food Network cooking with one on their Thanksgiving Special and reading the reviews of others on Amazon. No kitchen should be with out one and this particular one with its temperature alarm is superb.
1,JUNK,I have had mine for about four months and it just stopped working. The temperature jumps all over the place when I turn it on.Save your money and buy something better.
2,fail...,"This thermometer worked just great for 6 months. So here I am back at Amazon lookingfor a replacement. As others have stated, this is a ""must have"" tool for my kitchen.The timer still works. I'm sure it's just the probe that failed....so I still have a handy littletimer.Guess I'll try a different brand...I always thought that this unit needed an on/off switch.I see now that one of the other brands has added a power switch to their new model.I'll try that one and see if it lasts longer then the Polder.I recommend that all home chefs have a digital thermometer, just don't know ifPolder is the best choice."
4,Does just what it should,"Although my first polder thermometer broke the first time I used it, this one seems to be more up to the challenge. Basic thermo and timer functions have been used with no complaints."
2,ok but one big mistake,ok but one big mistake....no on/off switch...what! that's right you have to pull the battery out to turn off. Why I have no idea! oooppps I guess.
1,Alarm never worked,"If you order this, don't throw away the box like I did. You will have no way of returning it without the packing slip. The thermometer worked fine except there was no sound from the alarm making it essentially useless. I destroyed it with the sole of my shoe."
1,stopped working,"This would have been a great product... but we used it just twice and now the temperature always reads 300 degrees even before we put it in anything. Tried resetting, re-inserting battery, etc but no luck. So we can't accurately get a temperature anymore. Will be looking into a different brand to try."
1,No on/off switch on the unit.,"I am extremely dissapointed on the product. There is no ""on/off"" switch in the product. I thought I was going nuts turning the thermmeter over and over looking for the ""on/off"" switch. Maybe it may have an automatic time off shut off. That didn't work either. I spent time looking at the instruction. Of course it's multi-lingual manual. Finally on the very bottom of the instruction sheet in tiny fine print says that there is no ""on/off"" switch in this unit. No explanation what to proceed. It's a hassle try to unplug the battery and plug the battery each time. The product is very cheaply made. I think the bottom corner of the LCD screen had a tiny hairline crack on it. Low quality product and extremely dissappoint in the brand."
5,Highly recommended! Polder Cooking Timer/Thermo,"I love my Polder timer/Thermo. I wasn't sure how much I would use it at first, now I can't be without it! My friends love it, and I have ordered 3 more for them. The timer is loud, which helps is I'm out of the kitchen, I can hear it. I also use the timer for the kids when playing their alotted time on the video games, it goes off and they can hear it in the next room. I highly recommend this product, the only improvement would be that it should have 2 timers vs. one."
5,Great! Wonderful! Perfect,"I bought this to replace one we had bought at a local store, which didn't have it in stock when I looked. It has been so perfect for me and my family. We use the timer feature the most. My husband cooks with the thermometer alarm and is very happy with it.The one I replaced was at least 2 years old and I think the elementary school kid of ours broke it. I was very happy to see I could replace it by purchasing it from Amazon."
4,"Nice, but not for Induction","The thermometer works well enough at the beginning. Nothing has gone wrong yet. One major problem for those with induction cooktops is evidently the electronics have absolutely no shielding. That means when you are using an induction cooktop, even from a meter away, it freaks out with every slight motion. If you leave it in place, then it doesn't freak out as much. So far, so good, just great deals of trouble with induction stovetops."
4,"Good, but missing a few features from Previous Model","When my original Polder Timer/Thermometer wore-out, I purchased the ""Polder Cooking Thermometer with Clock"" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004S4U0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_hst_3 ), thinking it was a replacement, but that model was unreliable for cooking with the probe...After more focus on the description, I purchased the ""Polder Original Cooking All-In-One Timer/Thermometer"", which works almost as well as the original (it is missing the recurring reminder if the Timer expires). It is otherwise quite good."
3,for those with good hearing but...,"I ordered this because I have an old one that is on it's last legs.This one does everything the old one does but is difficult to hear in a noisy kitchen when the alarm goes off.The old one was so very loud and my being partially deaf was so appreciated for it's obnoxious loudness as I could hear it clearly even when the kitchen was a train wreck of noise, water running, exhaust fan running, clanking of pots and pans, and can openers operating not to mention the rock-n-roll blaring on the stereo.Good product, poor alarm.For some reason the quality on the alarm (and only the alarm) went downhill severely along with my hearing.I can still hear the old one though it isn't dependable anymore."
3,Not the Original!,"The ""original"" Polder thermometer came with a stainless steel probe that's attached to a braided steel cable. I loved mine and bought several. However, there were complaints about the original probe that it would fail if you got the cable wet. So Polder went to the plastic cable. IMHO, that was a mistake. I recently used mine in a BBQ, and the cable melted. I'd rather worry about getting the cable wet than worry about melting it in the BBQ, since I mainly use it while BBQing. Fortunately, I have several of the old cables. I hope Polder comes up with a Plan ""C"" soon that allows the probe to be washed and also used in high heat."
1,Worthless probes render it useless,"I have use Polder brand products including replacement probes for years, but the latest version of probes is a complete and utter failure. The replacements and new probes on recent shipments of thermometers all have a heat-resistant plastic-like coating over the probe wire much like a heavy guage coated wire rather than the prior successful metal mesh exteriors. Those with mesh occasionally kinked if abused by the user, but they never totally failed to give a reading with such short life. The mesh ones were good for one or more seasons. I am thoroughly dissapointed with Polder's ""new and improved"" probes. This, of course applies to any of the Polder products shipped with the new worthless probes. Another disturbing thing is that the photos of the probes appear to be the old mesh covered good ones and nothing in product description says anything about a different probe."
1,Didn't last,"I purchased this timer/thermometer just before thanksgiving. The first time I used it, it seemed okay, then temperature was way off. I came to the conclusion that the probe was shorted out. So it lasted for one Turkey. Will not buy another one. I should of sent it back, but it's in the drawer with the other junk I've bought thru the years."
2,meat thermometer with probe,I'm not sure yet. I have used it twice and the readings seem to be off. I'm going to have to find a way to calibrate this instrument. I don't think it's giving me reliable readings.
5,Don't Cook Without IT,I've owned one of these for almost 3 years and it has worked like a charm. No problems. Very accurate. No guessing if your meat is done! I leave my probe plugged in and use it as a room thermometer also. Rapid read out. Buying these 2 for gifts.
5,Reliable,"Have had this Polder Original Timer/Thermometer for 2 years now, and still haven't had to replace the battery. I don't think that's going to be much of an issue. The way to make it better would be to make it more of an ""instant read"" thermometer. It takes about 10 seconds to get the reading. Maybe I'm just impatient, and too cheap to spend the extra money for a Thermapen.I purchased the extra probe to have a spare, and qualify for free shipping, but haven't needed it yet."
1,Not made for heat,The probe's cord sleeve is made from silicon rather than a metal weave (like most continuous read thermometers). The manual says for BBQ and smoker applications to only use as an instant read thermometer. That defeats the purpose of this whole unit.RETURNED...
1,Does Not Work,"After following the instructions, even cooking the milk to achieve greater consistency for some recipes, the ice cream still comes out as small ice chips and melts immediately. If put into a container and stored in the freezer, the ice cream becomes a solid block. Based on my experience, in using similar ice cream makers, it appears that the freezing compound in them cannot keep the temperatures below 32 degrees long enough, and that the recipes do not provide the correct ingredients to insure a small ice cream that can be frozen and served similar to store bought ice cream."
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this product, but it just does not measure up. Maybe my freezer just does not get cold enough to make it work correctly. It just does not get the ice cream as hard as my old hand crank device."
2,Don't Expect Perfection,"I bought this for my wife because she loves to make ice cream for our grandchildren. It makes slush and that's about it. We've finished freezing it in the refrigerator, but it's nothing like we used to get out of our old ice and salt conventional mixer."
1,It has not worked for me,I have tried it twice and have not suceeded in getting any freezing at all. The bowl was in my chest freezer for a few weeks before I used it. The mix had been chilled overnight. The only thing I can try next is to put in less mix. Cannot reccomend it at this time.
1,Not so good,"I ordered two and my daughter one. We were not impressed with hers. Tried a couple of recipes and all went down the drain. Therefore, since mine were not opened, I am returning both. Spend your money on something else. nemaj"
1,NOT for use in the SUMMER,If you are planning on making Ice cream in the Summertime...forget it...I spent almost a hundred bucks....(I know thats what happens when you get these big ideas on baking good) at the store....pre mixed everything...set the batter in the freezer...after freezing the bowl for 2 days...was practically exctatic that I was going to have fresh cold ice cream within 20 minutes!! I had all the toppings...all the goodies....well...20 minutes later I go back to the blender and the batter is still the same as when I poured it...I am not completely blaming the product...HOWEVER......Im just hoping that you read this...to warn you that this product is better to use maybe in the cooler months...then it may work fine. =]
2,Does not fit European models!!!,"I bought my KitchenAid mixer from Turkey and bought the ice cream maker attachment from USA. The attachment that is advertised as ""converts any KitchenAid stand mixer into an ice cream maker"" wouldn't fit my mixer. A closer look at the photos in the booklet shows that my beating shaft was actually different than the ones shown. My dasher had a huge round spring that wouldn't allow the dasher to be pressed upward. This should have been mentioned in the product description section. I am very disappointed. I had to mix with a wooden spoon. I am giving it two stars because even with a wooden spoon (after 30 minutes of mixing) the result was perfect texture. I would have given it 5 stars if it had fit."
1,Does not work with European stand mixers. Part is $50. extra.,"After buying this and sending it to Israel to my mother-in-law, it won't attach to her European mixer. Ok, so 2 months later..... I find all kinds of places that sell the SMALL ADAPTER for over $50.00 USD. I can't believe this. Kitchen Aid is trying to rip people off for their buying mistakes. Do NOT buy this if you plan to hook it to a European model mixer."
5,love it,"I love my icecream maker. It not only gives my kitchen aid mixer another life, it makes grrrreat ice cream! I keep it in the freezer so that I can make icecream at will. If you have a kitchen aid stand mixer you almost need this neat item. If you love icecream like my group does, than you most definatly have to have it."
1,Dont buy it,I bought Kitchenaid Ice Cream maker not even a week then I had to return. It's so hard to use and really messy. And sometimes it not locked right.
5,Great and easy to use!,"If you keep the bowl in the freezer, you can make ice cream in about 20 minutes!"
1,Bowl needs to be in freezer for a long time and mixing speed is too fast,"I'm pretty down on this product for two reasons:1. The bowl is large and needs to be in the freezer for several days to get completely frozen.2. The mixing speed, even on the lowest setting, is too fast. This means that if your bowl is not completely rock-solid frozen, you are never going to get the ice-cream to freeze.I have a strong freezer (big GE Monogram), but invariably if you try to use the bowl and re-use it after less than 2 days, the ice-cream will never get to the desired soft-serve consistency before the bowl starts to thaw. This is a normal freezer with normal usage; if you have an extra freezer or can ensure that the bowl is going to get rock-solid, then perhaps this bowl will be OK for you, but if you want any sort of frequency to your ice-cream making (e.g. you want to make multiple flavors), then I think you might be better with a built-in compressor-freezer model."
5,Great,"I love it, and it works well. Cheaper hand crank makers could be an alternative but the item works well."
3,Won't fit European Kitchenaids! (including Australia and NZ) without extra parts,"Very speedy service and postage from Amazon, very impressed with that.Unfortunately the claim that this attachment will fit ANY Kitchenaid mixer isn't quite true. (found this out later)I am in Australia and have what is classed as a ""European"" model Kitchenaid mixer.The European models have a ring that sits on the beater shaft just above the pin you hook the beater to. This ring isn't on US model mixers, and it won't allow the driver for this ice cream attachment to fit onto the mixer.ALL IS NOT LOST....You will need another 2 parts a new drive assembly and dasher - which are basically the 2 other parts in the product image displayed sitting in front of the bowl. You can order these parts through Kitchenaid stockists.These 2 extra parts will allow your mixer to work on European models.Kitchenaid were wonderful and helped me out with the solution very quickly!"
4,Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr,A great adjunct to our KitchenAid mixer. Ice cream and sorbets when wanted. Better than sliced bread.
1,Don't bother,"I followed the instructions and froze the bowl for more than 15 hours. The ice cream mixture once poured into the bowl melts the bowl faster than it can freeze, even after I used an ice bath to cool the mixture. I would like to return this item but have used it so I'm stuck with it."
1,Defective product!!!,"We received this as a wedding gift (we registered for). It worked great the FIRST TIME we used it. We put it back in its original box for storage, and didn't take it out again for about 2 years. So the 2nd time we tried to use it - all the blue freezing liquid was leaking out a defective seam in the side of the bowl. We will be looking for a different product. VERY DISAPPOINTING! =("
3,A Little Tricky to Get Things Just Right,"My wife and I bought this for my Mom, as we have one ourselves. We followed all the instructions exactly, but things did not work out so well, for a couple of reasons. First, the bowl was not snapped down into the proper position until probably 2/3 of the way through mixing. We did not realize this, and the instructions did not emphasize the importance of the bowl being properly snapped into position. Second, we added thawed frozen strawberries in the last few minutes of mixing. The ice cream went from nearly solid to soupy almost instantly, and it never hardened again, even after many minutes of additional mixing. What a disappointment for the first trial run at Mom's house! I do think this is a good product, but there is a lot you have to learn by trial and error. My wife and I have made some killer ice cream with ours that would rival Ben & Jerry's. Good luck if you buy!"
5,This was a hit!,The ice cream attachment was all that I had expected and more. It was easy to use and made a great batch of homemade ice cream. I would certainly recommend this to all.
2,It works...kinda.,"Pros: Smaller and cheaper than most stand-alone ice cream makers. Allows you to get more out of your mixer. Cleanup is fairly easy.Cons: You either need to plan way ahead to make ice cream or keep this thing in your freezer at all times. Most of our batches have had some ice crystals. I think this is because it doesn't get cold enough to really freeze the batter, so a lot of the freezing happens after I put it in a container in the freezer. If you're serious about making ice cream at home, get a machine with a real refrigeration unit built in."
1,BEWARE,"This is a first for me to write a review on anything, but I am significantly disappointed. I love my Kitchenaid mixer so I saw the ice cream maker as a natural progression. Though I followed the ice cream maker instructions to the letter, my first attempt at using the ice cream maker burned out my mixer. Now I am having to replace my 6 qt, 575W Kitchenaid stand mixer."
5,Great Ice Cream Maker,"I absolutly love this, we have been making all different icecreams, sooooooo easy. My husband and I like things less sugary and it is hard to find ice creams less sweet. This is just perfect, i have been making recpies which do not require cooking or eggs and have been happy with it. Tried Coconut, mango, rose ice cream and Vanilla frozen yogurt."
5,Awesome ice cream!!!,Used it twice and both times the machine worked great and the ice cream came out creamy and tasty. It is important to freeze the bowl solid and I also put the batter in the freezer about 20 minutes before we make the ice cream. It comes out like soft serve but if you want it harder just put in a plastic bowl with lid and freeze. So far so good!!!!!
1,DO NOT BUY IF you have European/Asian Kitchen Aid!,"I bought this and several other items because I was in the States and it was a good deal. It states ""fits all models"". NO it DOES NOT! The models sold in Europe, Africa and Australasia can't use it because of the disk around the beater attachment that fits into the paddle. What a waste of time and money."
1,NOT FOR K45SS!,"This ice cream maker attachment may work well with other mixers, but it is a disaster with the 4 1/2 quart mixer. Page 13 of the K45SS mixer owners manual states that you ""4. Turn bowl gently in clockwise direction."" to attach it to the mixer. After the ice cream maker bowl came loose during the mixing process and jammed my mixer, I realized that the ice cream maker attachment tightens in the counterclockwise direction and so states in its owners' manual. A recipe for disaster. I will now need to replace the gear head assembly in my mixer. Do not use with the K45SS mixer!"
2,Misleading,"I'm sure the ice-cream maker attachment will be absolutely fantastic when I get it work. However, here's something that I feel should be at the top of the review section so worldwide buyers will be aware of this glaring irregularity: The mixer is certainly NOT compatible with all Kitchenaid stand mixers.For those stand mixer owners outside of the USA, if you have a metal cup thing on your motor beater, it won't fit as it needs a different ""dasher"" than the one in this model.Just FYI, so you don't waste craploads of money on shipment like I did."
1,"Nice concept, poor execution ...","I actually returned the mixer b/c it was horrible ... Had Kitchenaid spent a bit more time on figuing a better way to attach the blade to the mixer (they use a cheap piece of plastic that does not stay in place) it would have been a much mcuh better product ... Instead, it was terrible. To be fair, the bowl seemed high quality as did the mixing blade ... it was only the $0.50 piece of plastic that caused the entire concept to fall apart ... Hopefully this will be fixed in an upgrade ..."
3,ice cream attaachment,"The ice cream maker is ok,the product is difficult to attach to the mixer . IF you have the space in your freezer( great). I do like the fact that I can make my own ice cream with no artifical ingredients ."
2,you'll find it VERY inconvenient if you've ever used a proper ice cream maker,"as the reviews say, it does make good ice cream.However, if you've ever used a normal ice cream maker with a built in regrigeration unit, you will be highly disappointed. My mom has a great ice cream maker (from the 80's) that she just throws in all the ingredients, and then a couple hours later, voila!If that's what you're expecting, you're in for a surprise. Not only does the (very bulky) bowl need to be in your freezer overnight, but then you have to cook the batter and cool in regrigerator at least 8 hours, and then you can mix it in the frozen bowl for 30 min. Not exactly a quick process."
3,"Worked great, but didn't last long...","I bought this a bit over a year ago and loved it. It was so much easier than making the brine for the freezing process. My only disappointment is that mine broke in less than a year. I always kept the bowl in the freezer and my guess is that something bumped one of the tabs on the bowl and cracked it. I didn't find out until I was making a batch and blue liquid slowly started appearing at the base of the bowl. As the bowl thawed so that I could wash it the freezing liquid kept running out more and more. The receipt and box are long gone (I've never had an issue with a Kitchen Aid product before), but I'm not going to get another. Instead I'm opting for something that doesn't have a weak point like this bowl does. Maybe a rework of the design would help as well, after all it was a very awkward shape to fit in the freezer."
2,For a KitchenAid product it's not very impressive,"This makes good ice cream but overall it's a bit of a pain. You have to keep the bowl frozen for 12-15 hours before you want to make ice cream so you have to plan out ahead or leave it in the freezer taking up space. There is no lid on the bowl so alot of air gets whipped in and anything can fall in. As well, when I add solid ingredients (cho. chips, nuts) the paddle gets knocked loose and I have to stop down and line it back up. Overall, I would have rather bought a tradiational style ice cream maker. I'll probably give this thing away and buy a real ice cream maker."
1,your get what you pay 4...,Very light wieght and cheaply made... But this not a complaint and do not feel cheated. It is what I paid for and highly reccomend this product for starters..
3,Some darts are sharper than others.,"Decent darts, tails are kinda flimsy. Some darts are sharper than others, so not all of them stick in the board well."
3,What surprised me most when first trying this ...,"What surprised me most when first trying this peppermint toothpaste was that it didn't taste much like peppermint, compared to more commonly used toothpastes. I appreciate that its got """"all natural"""" ingredients, but every time I used it, it tasted more like baking soda flavor than anything else. I made my teeth feel clean though, and I grew accustomed to the light mint taste. It's certainly not bad if you're looking for a natural product, but I'm not sure I'd buy it."
3,I'd been wanting to try Tom's of Maine ...,"I'd been wanting to try Tom's of Maine toothpaste because of the all-natural, no artificial ingredients. I love the fact that it's produced cruelty-free (without animal testing), but I was a bit taken aback by the taste of the toothpaste. I think 28 years of using toothpaste with saccharin and artificial sweeteners has made this change a bit difficult. I found the taste of Tom's to be a bit hard to get used to. My six-year-old couldn't stand it, but I did notice that Tom's has toothpaste just for children. It did a good job refreshing my mouth and cleaning my teeth, but not any better than the brands I've used in the past. I'd have to say that for the money, it's just not worth it for my family. I think this would be a great product for those customers who are looking for an all-natural toothpaste."
4,Good Read,"I met Ms. Shapodee at at retreat in Savannah and was impressed with her reasoning for writing. I bought her book expecting it to be just OK as it was her first book. After reading it, I have suggested the book to many others. I like the way she build her characters and her story line is fast passed. Ms. Shapodee is not a young woman, but she has the teenage seen down real well. I am loking forward to reading her next book."
5,read this book!,"tTHE BEST BOOK I'VE READ IN A LONG,LONG TIME. A FASCINATING MYSTERY THAT INVOLVES FAMILY SECRETS AND COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS. ALSO A LOVE STORY AND SO MUCH MORE. THE FIRST-TIME AUTHOR MANAGES TO COMBINE LOVE,SEX, FRIENDSHIP, HUMOR, AND ADVENTURE IN THE UPPER-MIDDLE CLASS ATLANTA SETTING. THE FACT THAT THE CHARACTERS ARE AFRICAN-AMERICAN IS EXCITING FOR ME AS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN READER BUT ANY READER WILL BECOME LOCKED INTO THE STORY AFTER THE FIRST PAGE. I HOPE THERE WILL BE A SEQUEL AS WELL AS MANY MORE WORKS FROM THIS AUTHOR"
4,A PAGE TURNER FOR SURE!,WRITTEN IN RED INK CAPTURES YOU FROM THE BEGINNING TO END. WE ALL CAN RELATE TO THE EVENTS IN THE BOOK. THERE IS ROOM FOR A SEQUEL. YOU DID A WONDERFUL JOB KIEJA SHAPODEE.
5,"Kieja, It can't end here.....","I couldn't put it down (even at work).This book went by so fast, I hated for it to end. I even went back a couple of times just to read some scenes a second time. There are so many loose ends, there has to be a sequel."
2,Boring and Predictable,"This is the first (and will be the last) John Saul novel that I've read. I picked it up at a used book store primarily because I couldn't find anything else that I hadn't already read that looked interesting. There is a quote on the outside cover of the paperback edition that compares the book to ""Stephen King in his prime."" John Saul is no Stephen King in his prime. Stephen King's better books are ambitious in their scope, and explore old themes in unpredictable ways. This book brings nothing new to the genre, but instead rehashes the same tired themes that any horror novel about alienated teens are required to cover, and lacks ambition. I just couldn't seem to care what happened, because I felt like I had read about it all before, but in much more appealing packages."
1,If you are over 14 years old - pass on this one,"Not remembering that I had a read a book by John Saul many years ago (possibly as a teenager) and disliked it, I ordered this audio book. This author seems to have a penchant for writing storylines about dead prepubescent girls who are now ghosts, influencing subsequent tenants of their previous homes (also young girls) to somehow follow them to their untimely deaths. This pattern is overdone and very tired. I find it odd that this author can't be more creative. Doesn't he think we notice that his stories are repeating themselves, just with the names changed? The story reads like it was written by a 13-year old rather than a seasoned author and it is NOT scary. For example, a recurring theme in this book is children picking on each other in school. I can't imagine many adults would find this entertaining. The climax of the book was short-lived and it left me greiving the hours that I had wasted. Thus, if you are over 14 years old, pass on this one."
4,hard to put down,"I first read John Saul when I was eleven and have been hooked ever since. When I started reading this, I thought it would be another Amityville Horror. However, I was pleasantly mistaken. Saul managed to take my expectations and completely twist them, making me unable to put the book down. Great story. The only thing I could have asked for is a more detailed ending, but that's typical of his works. Definitely worth the read!"
3,What ever happened to tying up loose ends?,"Though the first four hundred pages of the novel were quite intriguing, the last sixty or so were an absolute disappointment. Having read most of Saul's work it seems as if he's patched together a conglomeration of Suffer the Children and classic teenage angst into a concoction that just doesn't seem to work. The character development which in the first one hundred pages was fine ultimately comes up short towards and the end when it seems as if Saul was in a rush to meet his publishers demands rather that the satisfaction of the reader. It wouldnt have hurt to add another fifty pages to give the reader a true ending, rather than the haphazard one that is presently there."
2,Not the best,"The first few pages kept your attention. I have read better books from Mr. Saul than this one. If this would have been his first book that I read definitely I would not read anymore.Sorry, there are a lot better books out there."
4,Touchstone of Talent,I love the Nickle Creek Band and was looking for more of their music when I found this CD. Sean's soulful talent shines through in this album. The only thing that could make it better would be for more of the songs to have words (only one does). But if you love the guitar (or blugrass in general) then this album will be a pleasure to own. It hasn't left my CD player for weeks.
1,Order 2 sizes larger then you think,We returned these skates because the toe area is VERY narrow. My kids have average width feet and the skates hurt. If you order 2 sizes larger then you need; they may work. We replaced the with other skates that fit just fine in the original size ordered.
2,Desribed as soft...NOT SOFT AT ALL!!!,"The seller describes this skate boot as soft Nubuck, but this skate is not in the least bit soft! It's very stiff, narrow, and has very little cushion in the insole. I'm sorry I purchased this skate!"
4,Nice starter for pre-schoolers.,"It's a nice prayer book to get pre-schoolers interested in prayer. But not an expensive book, so you don't have to worry about them messing it up. We really enjoy it. :)"
4,19 month old daughter loves it,We got this for my 19 month old daughter since she loves her outdoor playhouse so much. She loves going in and out the door. She will take a basket of small toys in there and and play for 15-20 mins at a time. It was a steal at Christmas time and well worth what we paid.
1,DONT BUY THIS,I would not reccomend this it is a great house and very fun but not very durable the plastic joints break very easy and they dont make these anymore so you cant get replacement pieces so once it breaks its trash I wouldnt waste the money.
3,Needs a couple of upgrades,"This was a gift for our two year old daughter. She is now three, and the house still stands! Its cloth walls are very nice, but there are a couple of issues. First, the house is in two pieces. This is very nice to make it more compact when not in use, but when my daughter is playing, there is nothing to keep it together - velcro would be nice to have on the floor of the cottage to attach the two halves together. Second, the door is made to have a top half and bottom half - not the greatest idea, my daughter just needs one door piece to open and close, not two separate pieces.On a good note, the frame is pretty sturdy - one day my daughters decided to flip the halves to the side and make them into boats! Again, velcro attaching the two house halves together may have prevented this, but the frame stayed together and the house still stands!"
3,cute but broken,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I've never seen her so happy about a gift. She absolutely loved it! So you can imagine how upset we both were when the plastic bits that hold the poles together started to break in a few days. So half of this house is sitting in our shed until I can figure out how to get it fixed. If your kids are hyper and distructive like mine...maybe think twice.
4,Girls aged 22 months and 4 love this!,"We purchased this for our daughters for Christmas- it took some patience to put together but it is very nice and durable. I would not have paid full price for this item but got it for a steal on Amazon, so I am happy with that. It's bulky so you have to have the space for it as it cannot be easily taken apart."
4,Great Make Believe Toy,"Our 1 year old daughter got this for Christmas. She loves it. She spends most of her days going in and out of the door telling us ""bye-bye"". I love that it stores compactly for the size it. It has provided hours and hours of fun. Our 5 year old son even will play in it with his sister every now and then."
3,Just o.k.,This product is just o.k.. I thought it would be bigger and heavier. I bought it for my 2 1/2 year old.It's pretty flimsy and can be easily pushed over (by a 11 month old who is holding on to every thing to walk).The stove that came with it is tiny as you can see in the picture the kids have to be on their knees to use it.I don't mean to sound so negitive and am sorry if I have discouraged you but it's just not a favorite. It is really cute though.
4,Rose Petal Cottage faulty stitching,"I ordered the Rose Petal Cottage from Amazon.com when it was on sale for both my daughters' big Christmas gift. When putting it together Christmas Eve I had problems with the fabric coverings. I realized that one side had overlapped fabric in part of the seam. It definitely was not going to fit over the chimney side structure. I had to pull apart the seam to free the fabric out, then hand sew the open end back. It fit great after that. I was glad to fix it, although frustrated to spend half the night panicking and trying to figure out the problem. I wonder if I was one of the unlucky ones to receive a defective cottage, or if a lot of other people had the same problem. I would have paid more money somewhere else to avoid this hassle. It worked out in the end, and my girls love it."
4,Wonderful playhouse for a little girl!,"We bought this product for our two and a half year old daughter for Christmas. She loved it and demanded we set it up first thing that morning. It took almost two hours to set up, would have gone faster if my child wasn't ""helping"" me do so. I would highly reccomend not setting this toy up in front of your child, but the night before. It has already had many hours of play with it. Our daughter incorporated her other play kitchen and doll beds with the house. A wonderful product for any little girl (or boy)!"
4,decent quality for the money,"We gave the rose petal cottage to our 3-year-old for Christmas and it was perfect for her size, but not a kid much older or larger than her. The stove was a little smaller than I expected, but that's okay. I was really surprised at how it looked when it was put together, because I couldn't imagine that large of a house being in such a relatively small box. I would definately rate this pretty good for the money. But, I do have to say we didn't buy any of the extra stuff that goes with it yet. I wanted to buy the house first and see if she liked it and would actually play with it or would it be a another short lived toy around our house."
4,construction a bit frustrating,"Ths product , once set up , provides hours of fun for both my 2 and 5 year olds. They absolutely love it.Not a one man job like it shows in the instructions. Once the frame is set up ,puting on the tent portion you don't want to attempt by yourself. With two it is still a bit of a struggle"
4,Loving It!,I love to watch my 18 month old daughter play inside HER cottage. She takes her 'baby' and just jabbers the whole time she's in there. She loves it!
5,Nearly Perfect,"I have not loved a movie this much in years!The movie changes a lot of details from the book (normally this would drive me crazy), but it doesn't matter in this movie because the ESSENCE of Jane Eyre remains the same (and I can see how the new details help the flow of the movie). It was almost as if I was reading the book while watching the movie--she acts in the movie exactly as she is described in the book. While I think Jane looks a little too old in the movie (that is my only negative remark about this movie--in all other respects, I think it is perfect), Mr. Rochester is perfect. They stay true to the characters in the book, instead of reinterpreting them in a modern light as most movies nowadays do (it always seems to me that most movies make the female characters more independent and saucy than they are in the books).Not only the acting, but the scenery and the music are beautiful too."
3,antonio aguilar,"Antonio Aguilar , is one of the most legendery actors out this generation, His movies have been scene all over the world. The Midnight Stallion,, is a great story, about a man and his horses. the actors in this dvd do a great job. I believe alot of antonios fans will like this story ."
3,Drag Queen review,"For what it is, it's not a bad album. Some of it sounds like a really good demo, but then again all I'm using it for is a review for a trans music web-site. This band is not in existence anymore anyhow. Unless you're a serious collector of music related to the GLBT community, you probably won't like this CD."
5,"dated, but still good","Well, Copper was never courted by a major label. They just imploded. Great band though. Second generation ""emo"" at its best. Think Velocity Girl meets the Cranberries meets Seam."
1,American Girl Magazine,"I would like to give you a review of this magazine, but I ordered it July 13, 2008, and am told I will not receive it until NOVEMBER 2008!"
1,TRASH,"I read this magazine once and I HATED IT!!! People always say that this is the perfect magazine for pre-teen girls, but they are so wrong. This is what the magazine is all about:-Tries to make it seem like all the pre-teen years are about is having stupid parties and doing crafts.-Tries to make people with problems in life feel like losers-Posts unhelpful advice, like if you are looking for advice on how to deal with crushes, they tell you how you can overcome your fear of brocolli (How helpful! NOT)-MindlessnessDO NOT i repeat DO NOT buy this so called magazine unless you want to feel bad about yourself."
1,No Substance & No Help Whatsoever!,"I subscribed to this magazine when I was having a lot of problems--in school, in puberty, in love, in life, in friendships, EVERYTHING! Since everyone said it was good, I got it and HATED IT! American Girl was no help to any of my problems! If all of life was based on AG, it would just be having fun parties and making crafts. It has absolutely no advice on puberty, and yet this is a magazine targeted for girls who are just starting to change and are probably scared about it. There are a few Heart-to-Hearts, but those are mostly things like the most unique gift you ever got and isn't helpful. For all fun and games and no substance, turn to AG. For substance and help for your real life problems, turn to New Moon, which is the same age group and is very helpful. DON'T GET THIS MAGAZINE!"
1,"not useful, not funny","There are a ton of pregnancy books out there with medical information, personal stories, etc. etc. I bought this one bc it seemed like a nice quick way to get some insight into what pregnancy was going to be like. It really didn't have any useful info & the attempts at humor were soooo lame. It's written in a chatty-i'm-your BFF kind of way, which sometimes works, but in this case, not so much. My ""S.O.""--as he is referred to throughout the book-- & I did have some fun trying to find the dumbest piece of advice... there was lots to chose from. Sorry to be such a downer about this one, but I wish I had saved my $ and not wasted the time reading it."
4,A fun countdown for pregnancy,"I started off with this book and two others when I found out I was pregnant. I really enjoyed this one because it is easy to read, has honest information and advice from real moms, and unlike almost all the other pregnancy books I read, it didn't concentrate so much on EVERYTHING that can go wrong. It was a lot more upbeat and I looked forward to reading it every week. The layout with the days countdown at the top of every page also made it easy to go back and reference. I definitely recommend this book for first time moms."
5,Loved this book.,I loved this book! It had something to read for every day of your pregnancy and I really looked forward to what it would say every day. Had lots of good info in it.
4,"Good, but not the best","This is a good book to read and is full of information that I haven't read in other books. Plus I like the way you can read day by day. I wouldn't use this as the only pregnancy book to go by, but it is a nice extra book to read. Would make a good gift for someone who just found out she was pregnant or for a baby shower."
3,Cute Coffee Table Book,"This book is cute to flip through, but it is not really organized in a way that makes it entirely useful. There is a few pages of information on every week of pregnancy, but not enough to make me pick it up every week to see what was going on with my body. Overall it appears to be an interesting coffee table book, not much of a must have reference book."
5,This is a super read!!,This is a really well written novel. I don't have any complaints about it. The only piece of information that I was missing was the fact that the auhor didn't get the translation of Spanish word correct. Fue una lastima.
5,awesome,how else are you going to learn how to look like rambo? this combined with arnold's encyclopedia of bodybuilding is perfect.
4,Good Book,My husband and I both benefited from this book. Sly is a real American icon and role model. The book provides an insight into the life of a dedicated success story and he gives the reader tips on how he's done it.
4,Work Fine,"I've had these bedrisers for about a month, and they work fine. I didn't give them five stars because they are not very attractive. I wish the finish were paint-friendly. I spray painted mine to blend in better, but the paint scratches easily on the glossy surface. I also wish the outside was round instead of star-shaped, because the shape looks odd sticking out from under the bedskirt.But . . . a good price and provides some well-needed storage under our king-size bed."
4,Bulky but they work,I picked these bed risers because they were adjustable. The work very well but they are big anf bulky and do stick out so if you are not careful you could stub your toe (another reviewer said the same thing).
3,"I liked it, but my kids didn't! It ...","I liked it, but my kids didn't! It wasn't sweet enough for them. I liked the Cinnamint flavor. It does lose its flavor too fast. It cleaned my teeth nicely, though. I might recommend it to friends. It's a good price for a natural product."
5,Gone Too Far.. (and too long) without these great albums!!,"Agree with last reviewer ""Song of Ireland"" I remember loving well. Some of these songs I have not been heard for 30 years! Wow..the memories they bring back! I speak for many I'm sure. MUCH praise and thanks to WOUNDED BIRD RECORDS for this! It was WaaaaaAY Overdue!! ""Song of Ireland"" can also be found on Eddies new PLATINUM COLLECTION.Now, I'm just wishing they'll get the album ROCKY MOUNTAIN MUSIC on CD.I'm afraid it's going to be neglected because I don't know what other album they could pair it with, since most from this era have already been matched. It SHOULD have been paired with EDDIE RABBITT from 1977. Because I love the song "" Tullahoma Dancing Pizza Man"". Does anybody remember that one? Sure it's kinda silly..and who can get get a pizza for $4.99 anymore? But it was a great song and brings back memories of the good ol' days.Oh well, at least we have most of the good stuff....FINALLY!"
1,the video is Crap!,"the video is Crap! do not buy! I thought that I can learn something but the video was absolute 100% waste of my money. I wasn't looking for entertainment buying that video, wanted to learn something new and they have nothing that one can learn. Total waste!"
1,Item not received yet!!!!!!,"I have not received this item. I have been told by the supplier that it is backordered with not date of shipment available. I am very disappointed with this kind of service. You have had my money since the time of the order and I tink I should be compensated in some way.What do you suggest I do? I still want the product, but I do not like having my money tied up while I wait."
3,Terk VR1 TV volume controller,"The controller seems to work well for RCA connections, but has no ports for HDMI connections. I think it has helped, but without the HDMI ports, it is only partially effective."
1,Totally Unsatisfactory,"The original and the replacement of this item both had the same problem when installed as per directions, in that it caused popping with any effort to regulate volume. I was sorely disappointed as the unit didn't live up to any of the advertised hype. Though this unit did regulate the volume levels it made such a mess of the sound I had to remove it after only a short test period. I rechecked all connections to make sure of correct installation of the units but alas determined that the unit itself was the problem..... not a good buy in my opinion."
1,DOESN'T WORK AS ADVERTISED.,This product doesn't work as advertised. It makes a popping noise intermittenly through my Bose stereo radio. I've had to disconnect it and put it in a drawer. Audiovox........you got me again. Never again will I buy an Audiovox thinking that they might have improved their products. They make [...] products. I've made the mistake of trying Audiovox products ever since they made 8 track radios.
3,"Clips high volume, but bring a high pitch constant note to sound","The Product is easy to use. I hooked it up in less than 3 minutes. It definitely does clip the loud sounds when you switch to a commercial or when a show is about to take a break. That has been heavenly. But after the first day of use, I noticed a high pitch note that plays constantly when we are watching a show, whether live or recorded. It drops out when you switch the unit off, but then you are back to the loud commercials. So we've decided to try to block out the high pitched note since apparently you can't have both. The high pitch note isn't super noticeable...in fact my wife didn't notice it until I pointed it out, and I'm guessing that if you have a sound system rather than just a TV speaker like we have, you could turn down that particular frequency and have the sound filtered out."
4,Controlling the TV volumn,"This little box does do what it claims - at least it helps. I hate when the commercials are loud when the programs are at normal volumn - this box does a pretty good job of leveling that out. It came with only one set of RCA audio cables - I did have to go out and buy different cables to make it work with my TV, not a biggie but it would have been nice if they had supplied at least some adaptions but then again, this wasn't very expensive. So all in all I would recommend this product."
1,Did not work at all,Hooked it up between my DISH 722 satellite receiver via the audio outputs and my surround sound receiver hoping it would level the volume difference between HD and SD channels. It did nothing.
5,"""Awesome"" you gotta have it","No more turning down the volume for loud commercials or turning volume up after commercials and between loud channels when surfing. Two minutes to hook up. Finally a volume controller that works. I have to turn it off sometimes just see if it is really working. To bad we have pay for a black box to fix a problem that the FCC should take care of ....taxes at work. They say it is just your perception commercials are loud, PHOOEY, my VU meters don't lie.Zapper"
2,Anti blast NOT!,"The VR-1 does seem to level the volume some but not enough. The commercials aren't quite as blasting but I still find the need to reduce the volume during commericals, not as much as before, but still have to do it. So net effect if you can tolerate not as loud as before you'll be happy. If louder at all is intolerable check other devices."
3,Some annoying clcks and pops,The device works but creates occasional clicks and pops. Possibly more annoying than volume issues. 2 stars
3,so-so performance,"Had a problem initially because my digital cable box has selectable audio volume settings of ""fixed"" or ""variable"". I had it set to variable which made this regulator much less effective. Setting my cable box audio output level to fixed helped and now the VR1 is a keeper but I'm not totally thrilled. I still find some commercials coming through louder than the program I'm watching - sometimes enough so that I have to reach for the remote to adjust the volume. Which was why I got this thing in the first place, so it doesn't fully do the job. I've seen much more expensive devices out there but am skeptical....."
1,It quits working after about 40 days.,"This devise doesn't last long. I did have a breif power failier in my area but if it is that sensitive, I sure wont replace it. I get no sound going through this devise anymore. If you can buy a simular devise by a different manufacturer, try that one."
1,Didn't notice any difference.,"I honestly didn't notice any difference. You can select to bypass the device with a switch, and I was flipping it on and off and it didn't seem to effect the volume at all. Loud commercials still woke me up, quiet TV shows remained quiet, loud channels remained loud.I only use my TV really low when I'm going to bed and it doesn't help at all. Blah."
1,Works Great - but durability continues to be an issue...,"I ordered the Terk VR-1 TV Volume Regulator about a year ago. It quit working after about a week so I returned it for a replacement. The replacement worked for about 2 months and then quit working also.EDITED - 2 Years later...This is the fourth Terk VR1 Automatic TV Volume Controller I have purchased. It works great - just as advertised but it could / should be a lot more durable. Nothing else on the market does the job - so each time I buy one I hope maybe this time it will last for more than a few months.The only competition to this unit I could find (""TV Volume Regulator"") is a complete waste of money since it raises the background noise to the same level as bombs dropping. In other words, raindrops are as loud as gunfire.So until there is something better, I keep buying the Terk (now Audiovox) because it is the only unit I could find that really does the job.If the unit was more durable I would easily rate it 5 Stars."
1,TV volume reducer that doesn't work,This product is supposed to lower the volume of your TV when those very annoying overly LOUD commercials come on. Great idea. Poor product. I have tried it on 3 different TVs with no success. I would not advise anyone to purchase this product.
3,huge bumpers,"These things are huge, They don't seem this big in the picture. No size discription was found anywhere. It will be better to mount w/stainless washers too I hope I don't look to funny on the lake with these."
3,Boat protectors,"These were a little difficult to fit but they do the job. Before you buy, take into account the size of your boat cover if it extends down to the fenders like ours. Cover doesnt fit in the front now."
3,"Too much ""black box""","As a compilation of Microsoft's sketchy and scattered documentation on ADO, this book succeeds. However rarely does it drill deep enough into the depths to be very useful. I give it 3 stars for a couple decent, though incomplete, chapters on handling conflicts and hierarchical recordsets. Maybe the author should have sprung for a few lunches w/ the developers."
2,goto msdn.microsoft.com,"If you dont have access to microsoft library then you can probably buy this book. its nothing but just the API reference. The foreword gives an illusion of getting interested but when the chapter comes its again refrence. and ""Questions That Should Be Asked More Frequently"" section is good, but i aint worth to buy the book just for that...."
2,non-complicated fluff,"Panties is an incredibly simplistic attempt to present the female nude in a ""High Art"" manner. Naz's sexual distraction as a means to convey a deaper sense of line and form was not done well. Although many of the subjects are incredibly beautiful, the choice of backdrops and positions do not do the women justice. Further, his true subject (panties) is more an after thought than a center piece.Panties is a decent conversation piece but is not worth the investment and is a bit too explicit as a coffee table presentation."
3,Ok for the price,"This is an ok marking knife for the price, the blade seems to be a little wobbly and not sharp at all."
1,Very Disappointed!,"I have been using this product, both the cream and pills, for 2 weeks now and i am not happy at all! Getting opposite results, my boobs have actually shrunk by an inch! Yes i measured them before i started it. Hopefully i can come back with better results at the end of the month, if not this is a complete waste of money!"
1,Very poor quality,"I would not suggest anyone buy these speakers. If you like loud music, don't buy these!! No bass response at all. Also, they are made of plastic. I am very dissappointed Infinity manufacter such poor quality."
5,EXCELENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!,"I received this product very quickly, however, it was broken when I opened the package. I emailed the seller and a replacement was ordered immediately. I did not have to send the broken one back or pay for the new one and wait to be reimbursed. I was sent all the confirmation and tracking info for the replacement item as well. The second frame arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Thanks!"
1,Cheap Frames,"I've seen better frames at the 99 cent store. These not only look cheap, they feel cheap. I'm not sure why they cost as much as they do when the quality is so poor. Returning."
1,I expected more,"""The frame that started the company over 30 years ago remains one of MCS top sellers. Built with quality and care to protect and display your treasures for years to come.""WRONG. First of all the picture showing the 4x6-inch frame makes it appear to have a black border or that the sides might be black but they aren't which could be workable but the description above states says this frame will ""protect"" your treasures... WHAT? How can this plastic, totally clear frame protect my treasure when it has poorly made cardboard backing? And the cardboard is so cheap that it tore the first time I tried to remove it. So sad. Maybe I'd feel better if I'd paid $1.00, Hey, that's what I should have done - gone to the dollar store!"
4,"A good book on the absurdity of the ""Good Book"".","Judith Hayes gives us a very readable and very personal critique of the Christian faith. Her style is clear, simple, and easy to follow. ""In God We Trust"" is a light read on a heavy subject. She makes her subject accessable and enjoyable with simple inquiry and ""every day"" common sense. A great book to give to ""believers""."
5,The most inspirational book I have ever read,"I am so glad this is back in print as my copy is falling apart from the number of times I have read it.The approach taken by the authors of emphasising the ""behind the scenes"" rather than from the astronauts point of view is extremely enlightening. The massive effort behind the program to put a man on the moon is spelled out with just the right amount of detail and is extremely entertaining and easy to read. I came away with a whole new interpretation of the phrase ""Well they can put a man on the moon, why can't they....""The methods, personalities and organisation detailed in the book is a beautiful study of how to carry out the most challenging undertaking of the 20th Century.If you are interested in space travel or manned space history, then you MUST READ THIS BOOK for the complete story!A FANTASTIC READ!"
2,not strong enough for me,"Like the concept and know several people who use this and remain stink - free, but this product doesn't keep me fresh. Sad."
2,not for me,I really wanted to like this product but it did not work. Let me revise that- it didn't work for more than 4 hours. I would have to wash and reapply every 4 hours or I would smell.
4,Hypnotic and calming,"I like listening to this while working on complex problems at work. When playing this with headphones, the rest of the world seems to disappear."
4,The Will Smith Music Video Collection,"Excellent DVD. Outstanding performances of this multi-talented artist.Regarding to Amazon.com, I am very satisfied. Price and target dates have been accomplished."
5,Big fan= a must,"I received this DVD as a birthday present, one of the best birthday presents a big Will Smith fan like me could recieve. Now I can watch Big Willie video's whenever I want! Not only would I recommend this DVD for anyone who is a Will Smith fan but I would recommend a DVD of music videos of a specific artist as a great gift for anyone who has a favorite recording artist."
1,Picture is not what you get,"The kit would be ok if you know construction or home design, just a pack of paper, no floor plan,not a kit to build more of printed material to use."
4,Does the job,It will make the soil acidic fairly fast. Good stuff. I used it to prep the soil for blueberry plants which require a very acidic soil and they are doing fine.
1,"Inability to fulfill orders, would not recommend","I ordered a tree to before Christmas, after patiently waiting, was finally told on 1/30 that there would be a delay until late March. Given other options I would recommend looking elsewhere, this company does not seem to have the ability to fulfill orders."
3,"Good, but not perfect","The sound is good. A little too much bass for my taste but overall the quality of the sound is acceptable.Design is nice and practical. Everything is fine except 2 issues:1. CD changer is very slow and kind of noisy2. I had problems with MP3 streaming from my laptop. Sometimes it worked fine but sometimes just skipped and it was not acceptable. Anyway, this mp3 streaming is adding actually just a remote for your computer so it is no big deal.I kept the unit for a week then I returned it because of the mp3 streaming problems."
3,"Good for Babies, not Toddlers","I purchased the Pampers Sensitive baby wipes to try out with our twin toddlers. We had been using Huggies wipes and thought with the great price for these Pampers wipes, here on Amazon, we would give those a try.The Pampers are a good product, but more so for a baby. Though I LOVED how each wipe popped out individually and were not connected to each other. They just are not thick enough to handle the messiness of my toddler boys. I would however recommend them to anyone with an infant."
5,Great wipes for both my kids,"Both my daughters have VERY sensitive bottoms. Pampers sensitive wipes and Target's version of Pampers sensitive are the only wipes I have been able to use on my girls. Their bottoms are so sensitive that I can only use Pampers, Luvs or Huggies diapers due to cheaper diapers give them diaper rash. I highly recommend these wipes and I don't think they are too dry and I have been using them for years."
2,pampers wipes suck,"Pampers wipes are rough and thin, you feel like you may get some doody on your hands. They dry out fast if left open. Pampers makes the best diapers, but Huggies wipes are the best"
4,"Love the wipe, hate the price","We have been using these wipes since day one. No complaints there. However, the current Amazon price is double that of our local warehouse merchant for 1/2 the amount of wipes.Double the size of the box and halve the price, and Amazon gets my repeat business on this item."
5,Great for new tushies!,"These wipes were recommended to me by friends and I loved that they were thin and gentle for newborn tushies. I think that thick wipes are better for bigger tushies and bigger messes, but these are great for the first 6 months at least! I've used a case in 2 months!"
2,Fastway - 'On Target' (Enigma),"I'm not saying this is all THAT bad of a CD. I'm just saying that it SIMPLY isn't Fastway. Certainly not the Fastway that I saw as support act for the AC/DC - 'Flick Of The Switch' tour. Now,that was incredible! 'On Target' is merely Fastway in name ONLY. Guitarist Fast Eddie Clarke should've changed the band's name as soon as vocalist Dave King left. The best Fastway CD reissues to snatch up a copy of are their self-titled debut, 'All Fired Up' and 'Trick Or Treat'."
5,A nice little introduction to the Bible as a book to read!,"This pamphlet asks and addresses these questions, from a Swedenborgian perspective:* Do you read the Bible?* Why should you?* What is in it for you?"
1,Safety First Easy Care Booster NOT SAFE!!!!!!!!!!!!,"First off this items is very cheaply made, but I picked it up for $15.00 so I expected that, you cant expect something wonderfully well made for that price. I had no problem getting my 25lb 15 month old in this, he fit great and I had no problem getting the tray to close comfortably around him. I also found the product to be easy to put together, which is a plus since none of us wants to have to wait for the hubby to do it!! I liked it, until I tried to attach it to our kitchen chair, the starps that are supposed to hold the seat to the chair do not stay tight at all, you just have to give them a little tug and they will loosten up. Afterward my hubby tried for an hour to get the straps to tighten, with no luck. I returned the item, I also have a 4 and 6 year old and I have not doubt that they would have knocked this seat right out of the chair with the baby in it. It is NOT SAFE."
4,Awsome track!,"The single ""Millenium"" is a cross between new pop and more classic instrumentals. The song is fun to listen to and sing along with. Plus the fact that Robbie Williams is an excellent vocalist. This song definetly earns its stars!"
3,very expensive ink,"It's ink. what else is there to say. Ahh, it is very expensive ink by the time I bought black and the other three (magenta, cyan, yellow) it was almost cheaper to buy a new printer."
5,Long lasting extra bright,"Epson makes excellent ink and printers. I use this ink for my Epson Workforce 600 and do daily color printing although not a ton of photos. I am thrilled with the life of the ink cartridges, I rarely have to change them. I especially appreciate how quickly Epson ink dries and has no trouble with highlighters. The colors look as bright as ever and never smear or bleed."
1,Failed to work properly,These cartridges look almost identical to the ones I've bought in stores or directly from Epson but the microchip on the front doesn't register the ink cartridge correctly. I was able to use the microchip from an old ink cartridge to get these to be correctly identified by the printer but for full price I expected better. Buy elsewhere.
1,INK was bad!,"I ordered this over 30 days ago and just decided to put it in my printer. To my surprise the ink was bad. I will try to return it. It's hard to stock up on ink with a 30 day return policy. I guess I will have to buy at the last minute. Regardless, do not buy from this company!!!!"
1,"total ripoff, get the high capacity","I print 0 color pages, got that? 0, I only use this printer to print shipping labels, I purchased these regular capacity ink carts for it to replace the high capacities I had in it FOR OVER A YEAR. It's been 27 days and these carts already warning me they are almost empty, funny thing is i print in grey scale black and white, I've never printed 1 page using color ink. I routinly use that practice with the high capacity carts and they last me 1 year, these didn't make it 1 month. Do not waste your money on these regular capacity carts, they are a consumer rippoff at it's finest, you will get 12x more ink in the high capacity carts."
2,Cost Effective?,My major gripe with Epson ink is not quality but cost per letter. I had a four month old Epson CX9400 that drank ink and wore out in no time. I chucked it but kept the cartridges to use in the Epson Workforce 600. The Workforce 600 is head and shoulders superior and does not use nearly as much ink. The drivers do not force me to use letter quality. I have purchased replacement ink and reusable cartridges from Ink Nova through Amazon and wait to use them. I like the idea of cheaper ink and reusing cartridges. I have not had much luck with such in the past but hope that the Ink Nova inks will be superior.
4,Epson TO69120-BCS 69 DuraBrite Ultra Ink Cartridge Combo Pack,"The Epson Ink that I ordered arrived in good condition. I am now using one of the cartridges (it was a multi-pack) and it is working well. Also, the price I paid for this item was well below the store prices. Thank you very much. Keep on ROCKING Amazon."
2,Quality good but finding correct cartridges is a disaster,"The price is extremely expensive in stores and doesn't last for many pictures. Also, This will be the second time I am going to return because I ordered the wrong inkjets. Very confusing."
2,The ink did not work,"I put ink in printer, it states it is full but it is not printing. I never had this problem before. I usually order with Epson, but thought I would save $3.00."
2,EPSON DURA BRITE INK JET CARTRIDGE,THE CAPACITY IS VERY LOW FOR THE PRICE. I HAVE OPTED TO GET THE LARGER SIZE SO I DO NOT GET IN THE MIDDLE OF A PRINTING PROJECT AND HAVE IT RUN DRY AND STOP PRINTING.NOT ENOUGH INK FOR THE VALUE.
3,Ink could last longer,"Unfortunately, the amount of ink is as always ridiculously small.Other than that the inks from original producers are just great for quality, and I have nothing to complain in quality."
4,Good ink - gets the job done.,"This ink has worked great for me, but the one thing I don't like is that when it tells me I need to replace the ink, I shake the ""empty"" one and there is still a little bit of ink in there - maybe it's that way with all ink cartridges, I don't know. But this ink works great."
1,Bought Wrong Product,"For several years I've been buying ink for my Epson printer yet this time I bought the wrong one. I don't want to blame this mistake on Amazon, but something obviously confused me resulting in the mistake -- as I said I've bought the correct ink many times for this printer and have trouble attributing the mistake solely to my own stupidity. Anyway, enough whining, I'll just make sure to buy in person and not online in the future. I would have returned it but I opened the outer box."
1,No black included,"I ordered a four-color package, but the one I got did not include a black cartridge. I was ripped off $10, and actually around $15 for the cost to order a separate black."
1,Printer Problem or Cartridge Problem?,"Like everyone else, I'm sick of stupid printers. They never work right and are incredibly overpriced. Well, this is no exception. Plugged in the cartridge, and it worked great, printed out 10 pages that I needed. The next day, it was printing a couple light lines, nothing legible. I used the printer's nozzle cleaning, and it worked ok for the rest of the day. Next day, same thing. Repeat this for the rest of the week. Today, it did it's usual, and now it won't work at all. It's just telling me to replace the cartridge. I printed maybe 25-30 pages total and I can't do anything now."
1,very dissatisfied,Put in the new cartridge and had to replace it with the other black. DId not like the fact that product was defective.
5,Excellent product,It's everyting it should be. Arrived iin just a few days. So much better than going to a store in every way.
2,Imperfect,"Purchased these refilled cartridges, but the print quality is choppy and smeared. It is a functioning product, but not reliable for any important images or documents. I have since gone back to the cartridges specifically designed for my printer, and my printer only."
3,DOA - Well maybe not,"Dead On ArrivalTwo of the 3 cartridges did not work when placed into the unit. The system reported they were good but when printing only on color worked. Tried everything I could think of but no good. Had ordered them as a backup so when original unit ran out I was ready. Since it had been a couple months since I ordered them, I could not return defective units when I finally plugged them into the printer.Junk and my loss..Update : Ordered another set. Guess what. It did not work either. After play with everything I could think of and cleaning and cleaning the heads I think there might be something wrong with the printer. Maybe I should be writing a bad review on the Epson Workforce 600 instead."
1,"Damnit! Buy at a store, not online","Ink cartridge replacement, right? Simple enough. There are a bunch of imitators out there, but i thought, hey I'll get the name brand product to make sure there are no problems. Don't bother. Bought the more expensive name brand just so i could get a ink cartridge that would print every other half inch. Weeeeeeaaaak! If i purchased this at office max or fry's, id just take it back. Damn ink cartridges! Hate...HATE dealing with this crap. Total money down the drain...Makes you think...considering the price of the printer, ink replacement etc, is it cheaper than just going to fed ex? Maybe. More convenient? I guess it would be if the damn cartridge worked!"
1,Very disappointing,"Although the Epson ink box stated it was for a CX8400 Epson Printer, when my husband inserted the ink, the printer stated that the inks were not correct and we cannot use the printer. We are very disappointed.Lillian R. Davis"
1,ink cartridge,I have not been able to get the black T0691 cartridge to go into my printer. The other colors are no problem. I have received replacements that also do not fit. We are at a standstill as to how to solve this problem. At this point I thinkthe best thing to do is go to a office supply store and buy one that fits. There is a problem with the grooves on the left side which are not compatible. They are different than the empty ones I need to replace. I have had a computer man try it and he could not insert it either and suggested I get a refund and purchase it at a store.I have been told to print a return mailing lable and tracking number. I cannot do this without a printer and I cannot use my printer without the ink cartridge which I am trying to replace.Janetta morgan
3,terrible packaging,"It arrived with a badly damaged inner box. I hope the cartridges are ok, but I don't really know yet. I will not order from this company again."
1,Not compatible,"The product was not compatible with my printer even though it says it us. My printer cannot read the ink as valid, so I had to buy another one. What a waste of money."
5,Produces nice copies and lasts a reasonable length of time,"I rely a lot on my printer and need good quality hardcopy. I do multiple copies of a craft handout for my Community Ed craft classes--origami, knitting, tatting and painting--and have been very satisfied with the way this ink performs."
4,magical,"Me, my best friend, and his girl, read these to each other on the beach one night. The stories and the seting were perfect. They lean more towards hesses surreal stuff, and they're simple and beautifull."
5,Oil Rubbed Bronze Dead Bolt,"I build a new house 5 years ago and the original dead bolt broke. I was able to find a replacement on Amazon that matched my existing hardware perfectly. In addition, the new hardware has been reengineered and the changes should result in a longer life."
5,Heart Like A wheel,"I enjoyed this movie because unlike most racing movies they have got the car sounds correct.You get drama,comedy and some good drag racing scenes."
5,Bedelia is Exquisite,"I saw this movie when it was shown in theaters back in 1983. It is without a doubt a great film due, in large part, to Bonnie Bedelia's performance. Heart Like A Wheel is by far her finest film, and she deserved an Academy Award nomination. The bonus material is interesting enough. Muldowney's derogatory remarks on Bedelia were uncalled for, especially in light of the critical praise she has received for her role. Jonathan Kaplan's comments painted a much different picture of Bedelia's work ethic. Make sure you watch the film at least once with Kaplan's commentary; it is the best bonus feature and very entertaining."
1,Not an accurate depiction,"Some good action scenes, but historically innacurate. Cha Cha's halo is a little tarnished in real life."
2,mom23987,"I was dissappointed with this product. It says automatic open BUT it is not totally automatic. After you press the button, it does pop up BUT you have to lock it in place manually. When you are also carrying packages, laptops or whatever this is a pain in the neck. But it is pretty small and pretty cheap so it's not such a bad deal. But be warned, it is not 100% auto open!"
4,Body Book,we purchased this for our grandchild - we had used it for our children. they remember it and are pleased to have a copy to share with their children as they grow. only negative - delivery was very slow.
2,Beauty,"I particularly enjoyed the micro and macro expositions on beauty. The references to the many catholic rituals and such were much less appealing to me.""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."" - Romans 10:13"
5,"Receive the ""Sacrament""","The best Lamb of God to date. They have put together a strong set. Fierce guitars and drums, gutteral vocals slam throughout the disc. Even the slower songs fit cohesively with the others. Must for any Metal Head."
1,generic and disappointing,"i never thought i would say this but LOG disappoint big time with this ball-less and tame album. the energy and the creativity prominent on all their previous efforts are nowhere to be seen on this album. personally, i cant even get through the record without getting bored and turning it off. whatever randy did with his vocals puts me to sleep faster than ambien. he sounds like 'the great southern trendkill'-era phil, and thats not a compliment compared to previous LOG albums. i cant believe all the five star reviews of this- you guys must like trivium. keep real metal alive- check out anything on relapse and willowtip records."
5,OH...MY...GOD!!!!,"This album is just simply breathe taking. It is very irreverent, unapologetic and very unforgiving, and I love that in heavy metal. They deliver a hardcore sucker punch to your ear drum with this one, and that's why I am so addicted to it!!!! Another requirement in every metal collection!!!"
5,Descending into the darkest release yet,"You'll feel like a recovering heroin addict as you sit in a dark corner rocking back and forth from the shock......the shock that music this good exists!!!! God bless Lamb of God, you guys are geniuses!"
4,It works!,"Basic alarm clock with everything you need and nothing you don't. Very easy to use, so feel free to throw away that manual. The numbers are large and easy to see from across the room except in bright sunlight. Unlike another reviewer, I never found that the LCD noticeably lit up the room at night. Volume and radio quality are good. You can't set multiple alarms or save radio stations or set the snooze duration, but let's just leave that for clocks of the more digital generation.The only caution I have is that turning off the alarm is just as easy as hitting snooze-- just slide the bar to the off position. Basically, you can do it in your sleep. So if you're one of those sleepers whose body seems to trick you into being late all the time, opt for a different alarm that's more difficult."
1,interesting idea but wasn't moved,"I like the idea that you can make your own workout, this software or dvd style should be implemented in the new blue ray disc since they are so expensive. Anyway, I don't remeber working out to it at all, just watching it and having fun making a new workout routine. Yes, I had nothing better to do with my time. Save your money for a real pilates class. If you must buy a dvd go with Ramona pilates or laurie winsor."
2,Massi and Bizet are the winners,"Massi is great in the role of Leila. Nakajima is terrible (to say the less) in the role of Nadir, Grassi is OK in the role of Zurga. The production is horrible. Very italian!!! sometimes you feel like watching one of those popular variety shows presented by the RAI with some exotic (and very distracting) dancing at the background whilst the singers deliver their parts. It is particularly intrusive and disgusting the circus style dancing that takes place during the famous duet of Zurga and Nadir. The sound of this DVD is pretty bad as well. Overall two stars mostly because Bizet and Massi."
5,No better diabetic organizer!,"We purchased this for my son as a replacement for his previous organizer (a similar medport which weathered the storm of a young boy for over 8 years). It is not only sturdy, but the only organizer I found to have this many zippered pockets and other storage places. He uses the pump now and can still store all his backup pump supplies, insulin pen, meter, strips, glucose tabs, etc in this relatively compact bag. What a find!"
1,Don't Use This Book!,"This is, to date, one of the worst textbooks I have been made to use in a college class. The text does _not_ give general formule for the principles it explains, but instead uses numbers almost exclusively in example problems, leaving the student to wonder just what is really going on. Every week, when I sit down to work my Circuits I homework, I feel like hanging Dorf and Svoboda by their mustaches - all because this book is so wretched. The end-of-chapter problems are useless to help understand concepts, as they frequently do not relate adequately to the material presented in each section.If you ever read this, Dorf, Svoboda, please stop trying to confuse students with your work. If you want to teach, teach. If you want to be confusing, go into law."
3,"Decent Book, but there has to be better","I needed this book for an introductory Circuits class. In my case, the instructor rarely used the book for anything other than chapter problems for homework. however, when I did use the book however, I felt that It did not explain some circuit basics well, making it hard to continue through the rest of it. Also, most of the problems have no example that is even remotely similar to the problem, which makes it hard to get through the tougher problems. If possible, Look for another book to learn circuits."
4,Great knife,"This is a very nice knife.As was mentioned it is sometimes difficult to change the blade, you need to make sure push the blade ALL the way out and then press the blade release button. The spare blade holder is nice and big, I have about 5-6 blades there. The string cutter doesn't seem to work all that well, so I ususaly just use ther enitre blade to cut string."
3,Quick-change??,"After about 20 frustrating minutes trying to 'quick-load' the blade, trying to look for the nonexistent instructions on how to do so, I noticed the screw on the side of the casing. I loaded the blade the old fashioned way - remove the screw, open the handle, insert the blade. I won't be using the 'quick-change' feature."
2,Distasteful,"""He'd never made love to a woman who was frightened of him...and he was looking forward to it"". This is pretty much the mood of this book. From the minute Cass, a single young woman arrives in her father's apartment with a convicted murderer is inside, her reactions in this story are simply not believable. Later, Richard (the convicted killer) walks out from a meeting with Cass and a team of lawyer. He stands up and orders Cass to leave with him. She jumps out and runs after him hand in hand (I think). This story has too many frustrations, mostly concerning the actions of Cass, to really enjoy. This story has no spice, no warmth, just a young woman falling for all the traps a strange man sets for her. Pass on it."
1,Cheap,"After assembling the frame with my picture inserted, (and I was very careful to ensure the clips were snapped into place because I was very exciting about hanging an art print I received for Christmas), I was trying to hang it on the wall. As I was adjusting the frame to make it hang straight, one of the clips snapped off, the frame fell, shattered, and damaged the print. I owned it for all of 5 minutes."
3,I usually prefer an anti-perspirant as well as ...,"I usually prefer an anti-perspirant as well as a deodorant, but I wanted to give this a try. It didn't keep me dry so I didn't use it for long. The smell was nice and the bottle size was standard. The name gives me the idea that it's for men, but I don't know if that's true."
3,Readable but not Henry's best work...,"This book is a good introduction to Henry's writing. Though if you've read his better stuff ala Black Spring The Tropics, like me, you're probably going to be at least a bit disappointed and want to hurry through it instead of savor his writing like usual."
4,Excellent resource,I found this to be a very simple to read book with principles that go beyond the current trends of the day in church growth. I am going to lead a group of people in my church through this book. It has helpful follow through steps at the end of each chapter.
4,Dutch film for children is wholly enjoyable,"I don't know a lot about dutch cinema, haven't even seen a lot of dutch movies, but a lot of the dutch films I have seen (specially comedies) seem to me to be consistently great, generally commercial but very entertaining and thought provoking. This is apparently based on a very popular children's book I haven't read. A cat turns into a woman after coming across some chemical stuff spilled from a barrel. She finds herself transformed into a woman on the rooftops of her small town. Eventually, she takes refuge in the apartment of a struggling but honest reporter, and through her ability to communicate with her fellow cats, she helps him expose a case of local corruption (a scoop that saves him from being fired from his newspaper). This movie wouldn't work as well as it does without the charming perfomance of Carice Van Houten (she starred in Paul Verhoeven's Black Book) as the titular woman/cat. Theo Massen's performance as the shy reporter is also great."
4,A fun movie,This is a real cute movie- Fun for all ages. You can't go wrong buying this dvd if you like cats and a bit of a mystery
3,"It;s Good, Expensive but good","Not as i expect, but it's fine for me. Not quality for the prize i paid."
5,"Get it, Read it, Ponder it, Implement it, BE...","This book is a must have for any serious poet/singer/songwriter. The author breaks it down with the best of the best. The work sheds light on inspiration, perspiration and infatuation with the muse. After reading it you are guaranteed to pick up your guitar and begin noodling. Enjoy"
2,Reading 400 pages is not necessary.,"This book has good points but is very redundant. Out of all that's being said, the whole idea is to basically run on the balls of your feet and do not over-extend your stride.It doesn't take 400 pages to tell that. However, the book is still enligtening and educational if you choose to read the entire book.For some reason, I believe I could have gotten all of this information for FREE on the Net. But oh well, I won't cry over $24."
3,too short,"This workout does get your heart rate going, but it's way too short. A large part of the 20 minutes is just stretching, so you really only do about 13 minutes of cardio, which really is not enough."
3,I've done a lot of workouts,"I've done, P90X, Ten Minute Trainer, Tracy Anderson Metamorphosis. This stuff is so hard ! I'm in my early 30s and my joints hurt from this. When it's only 30 minutes it's perfect for my lifestyle ."
3,Workout,"This is a hard workout, even the warmup is tough, but I guess nothing is worth having unless you work for it. I would recommend it to a friend."
3,Must be good if you can do it,I have bad knees so its difficult and way too fast for me. But I'm sure if you can keep up and your motivated it would be great.
3,poor vidoe quality,"I just want to say, this workout on the video is killer okay! My suggest though to have video on a better quality as the video was moving too much at the beginning and the guy in the back, he's not ready for this workout and I'm sure Shawn can have a better background guy who can handle the whole shot of video without stopping and showing us that the girl actually better performance than him! come on...other than that, work out is good enough to make me sweat like a crazy! But when you have been around army trainer, this is something easy for you to do!Let's get in shape!!"
4,Great workout,This is a killer 20 minute workout video that's definitely worth the money! It's requires a lot of energy in a short period of time.
5,Great Introduction to INSANITY,"I just received my DVD today and finished one round with it. It holds up to the name pretty well and had me sweating pretty good about half way through. I'm not sure why people are complaining about the audio/video quality. Everything was clear and crisp for me. Did it ever occur to anyone to turn up the volume, haha?For those sitting on the fence about buying the larger INSANITY package, this is an awesome introduction and stands as a good workout on its own. Also perfect for those with busy schedules. Easy to fit in a session before work or before bed. After 30-60 days of use, don't expect to keep progressing much though. That is the time to upgrade and push yourself further."
1,Did not play,Put the disc in and it just hangs at the intro. Tried multiple devices and it did not work. The disc came from Beach Body. Trying to decide if I want to roll the dice and get another one. Need a work out for rainy days and extreme heat.
1,it didnt work...,"I bought Insanity for p90x, and I just got it today. I put it into my DVD player, and it didn't even play! The disc is way to small for my DVD player, and same with the computer disc player! It doesn't even work! I hope for a refund..."
1,$22 for less than 20 Min Workout,"Out of 20 Min, they take about 5 min to warm up, during the 15 min, all they do is moving extremely fast with the workout routines that you are already familar with.They do it so fast that they can't even keep up.15Min workout for $22? really?"
2,Get Your Green Thumb Ready,"I used this company because it had such good reviews, but though my tree game full of dark green leaves they quickly started to fall off. As I took the tree out of the box I noticed a significant amount of leaf-loss, but it was so full of leaves I figured this was normal. Over the next week about 75% of the leaves fell off despite proper watering, humidity, and sun. The company sent me a replacement tree which arrived all but dead. I now believe that both trees experienced shock being transported in the cold weather. I was able to save the first tree they sent me but I would advise agains ordering in the cold weather months or paying for expedited shipping."
1,hated it,"I would give this no stars if I could, it is the second bonsai in a year that came with a fungus. First one was a Christmas present from my husband, I thought I was doing something wrong didn't know that the white cotton spots was a fungus, I thought they were mini spider nest. When the second plant arrived I saw the same white web spots, again thought they were spider nest., as the tree was losing leaves quicker than the first plant, I asked, Heidi, a plant specialist if she had any suggestions as to what I was doing wrong, and when I brought my plant problem to her she told me there was nothing I could do to save the plant and said that is a fungus in between all branches, not spiders. Now I own 2 dead plants do you think the company would replace them with some healthy plants we will see..."
1,The Indoor Bonzai Tree arrived infested with Spider Mites,"To avoid dealing with returns, we tried everything we learned to save this Fukien Tea Bonzai without success. This Bonzai Tree arrived infested with spider mites. I just decided to send an email to the company to get help and can't find a way to do so.I'm hoping they will support me on either find a solution to cure the infestation or send me a healthy replacement."
1,Bonsai,"I would have loved this Bonsai. It came very dried out, and VERY sticky. I got it pretty revived by setting it in water for a couple hrs each day for the next couple weeks. But continued to be very sticky. Could not see anything on it until I had it long enough to discovered it was infested with bugs. One big sticky mess....I have too many other plants to worry about an outbreak so I threw it out. Won't buy another plant I can not see first. Could have been a beautiful plant."
2,Mostly problems...,"1: No drip tray that's required, but not mentioned.2: No rocks for tray, which say are included in included instructions.3: Soil so compacted that won't absorb any water."
3,"Thin, very thin book full of love.","I love this guy, Lester Levenson. I think he is real, not a marketing product. You just have to have a look at his photo, to his eyes, his smile, to understand that he knows what he is talking about. Love. In this book he muses about that subject and chats with his students. The book is inspired but not Great. I mean, his message it is great, but the book it would be forty pages if it was presented in another way. People, specially (but not only) Lawrence Crane, are making good profit with him, publishing books that are no more than a few pages long and adding a few comments here and there and a lot of publicity for their courses and other books. The Joe Vitale way. They have a right to that, (I guess...) and anyway it is always a well spent money even if instead of a book you get just an interview or an article. It is about love. But someone has to indicate the fine print also, what you get for the value of your money."
3,I don't get it.,"I don't get it. The title is ""The Greatest Sedition Is Silence : Four Years in America."" I know that Pitt is pro-America/anti-Bush and that he is writing to say that ""We the people"" have hurt our country by being silent to the horrors of the Bush administration.Here's where I get confused. ""Sedition"" means incitement of resistance to or insurrection against lawful authority.Therefore, Pitt is saying that the Greatest (best) way to rise up against Bush is Silence. huh? The best way to counter Bush is to say nothing?"
4,lovely slicker ticker tape,"not often that these cheeky bedroom wizards also believe in beauty. it's quite obvious that mr. slicker does. he takes you out there, but not so far that you can't still tap (or stomp) your feet. i'd rate this disc 5, but i'm holding out to check his next venture."
2,Beautiful but...,"These shoes are really beautiful. If you buy them, you'll receive a zillion compliments but...the upper material is really hard and is so narrow that literally crush your toes.I cannot tell you if I'm happy or not: when I wear them, I could fall asleep looking how cute they look or simply faint because of the pain..."
1,"""No chance, for having any value""","After having been on a low cal/low carb diet for three months and loosing 13 pounds, I decided that I might need a vitamin and mineral regimen. I am 65, active and healthy. I desolved one tablet, as directed, in a glass of juice (6 oz) and within 20 minutes of finishing the drink, I felt just terrible. My intestines started seizing with cramps and I got an uncontrolable urge to move my bowels, which ended up being thunderous and painful.Not sure whether I should take another dose!"
2,Don't Buy For a 4Runner,"This bag was junk on a 2001 4Runner. The poor fit made it hard to secure and even more difficult to load and unload. I realize it isn't made for all vehicles but I purchased mine only after speaking with Lund, who confirmed the bag would work on my vehicle. Spend the extra money and buy a hard shell unit with adjustable hardware. Great service from Amazon, terrible service from Lund."
3,"Story excellent, recording defective","The story is excellent, and one of my favorites. The problem with this 10-CD set is the recording: the initial 15 minutes of first disc contains static that makes the sound difficult to hear. The seventh disc contains 8 or 9 ""holes"" of silence at random intervals, and tapers off at the end in garbled sound.Given a choice of narrator, I'd prefer Steven Briggs, but Nigel Planer does a passable job, and even excels with Lady Ramkin's voice."
4,Good bowl but holder rusts,I used this in my puppy's kennel to leave him a little bit of water when I was gone for a few hours. It works fine and attaches tightly but I found the holder starting to rust very quickly once it got wet.
2,Its alright,"I thought it was going to be more durable but its not. It would not stay level on the hinge. I bought it for my cousin who has a husky, and she was not happy with the product so she just uses the bowl and puts it on the ground. I would not recommend."
3,lacking,I am a language instructor and a methodology instructor. This book goes through many language teaching methodologies with mediocre definitions and explanations. Then it provides samples and some discussion questions. What is painfully lacking is that there is ZERO support/research for any methodology. I guess it never promised this in the first place but would you read a book on cancer treatments that provided zero research on the effectiveness or outcomes of those treatments? The only reason that language instruction ever takes place is the goal of language acquisition and communicative competence and a book that completely ignores that can offer minor value at best.
2,BORING! Zzzzzz,"Fear and Loathing is just NOT fear and loathing when it takes a tedious and disappointing turn into polotics and other extremely uninteresting matters. Hunter, what's up man? Get back to the drug-induced random ravings and rantings. My advice is to stick with the orginal Vegas Loathing, this just doesn't compare."
4,Reading through the fear,"Great book condition, just as promised in the description, and a great read on top of that! Great seller, quick shipping, and I'm definitely a satisfied customer~"
2,great gun... when it works,"Light, smaller design, powerful, and toenails well. The positive aspects of this gun are great, so great infact that after returning my first one, I purchased a second. The second, however, had the same issues as the first. The piston rattles and occasionally dislodges. When this occurs, absolutely nothing happens when I pull the trigger. Shaking the gun violently seems to realign the piston. This process is extemely aggrivating, especially when straining to hold a board in place.My first gun, I thought to be a lemon. After my second gun failed in the same way, it is clear that Hitachi has issues to address. From a carpenter's perspective, I cannot reccomend this gun. It's flawed and unreliable. Get on the ball Hitachi!"
4,it does pretty well,"I do a lot of deckbuilding, some light framing, dont shoot this into LVL, but if you get the gun the air, it will put the nail home. I used my first for about a year and recently, while shooting nails thru joist supports, the piston tip shattered. his is the first time i experienced a tip shattering, I was not lining up the holes, just shooting thru the steel. I bought my second from EBAY for 119.00, and am using it as a backup until toolbarn ships me a new plunger. The used gun I got has a LOT more wear on it, but after doing a couple of decks with it (2500 3 1/2 ring shank nails) there is no diffrence, and yes, I am still shooting the nails thru the joist brackets. I would buy this gun again, and an very happy. It has made me a LOT of money."
4,Stanley,I think I have done this before. It is good knife and does the job and is priced right and service was good. I think I got sooner than what was told.
5,nice cutter,great box cutter. Seems like it will last.does its job. I have owned it for 2 weeks and no complaints yet
2,Wahl Designer Clippers,"I just had my first haircut with this particular model. At first, the clippers sounded like a well tuned strong running engine. After three minutes they lost power and seemed to be chewing pieces. I have tried different Wahl models and found the chrome corded model with the smaller battery trimmer was and is the most reliable and consistent model. Don't waste your money on this one!"
2,Not very good as time goes on,"The first 3 uses of this clipper worked well. Very easily to cut hair, cool to warm temperature of blade, looks good. After literally the 5th to present number of uses, the problems so far:1. The temperature of the blade becomes unbearably hot after about 15-20mins. It gets worst in the summer when its humid.2. The blade actually started to rust! Had to wipe off the rust repeatedly to remove it.I took care of this thing very well: oil blade before and after use, brush off hairs and cut hair only once a month.Conclusion: The bad reviews on this thing is true. I would not purchase this again or recommend anyone to buy this."
3,No opinion for an obvious reason,"I ordered the tripp lite SVGA monitor cable and it was delivered to the new address promptly. Upon moving the monitor and computer tower around to install the new one, I found I had ordered an extension and NOT a m/m SVGA cable. Be very careful ordering stuff, or you'll end up like my own lame self with the wrong part and have to send it back. Amazon was very quick in returning my money, which is always good!"
5,Wonderful CD,"I love it. I saw her in concert at LBC in Alexanderia, LA and the cd I had got damaged so it is a replacement."
5,Worth the price,Worth a few more bucks than the cheapies! Invest in a good name and you'll be happy. American steel and durability. Using these blades for years and never fail to disappoint.Hint: reverse position when edge dulls.
3,Defective,"I received this from Amazon, and unfortunately didn't open it till 3 months after I got it. The interior plastic bag that should seal is ripped, from one end to the other. My fault for not opening it sooner, but I advise you to open it immediately!!"
2,Very basic guide,I bought this book hoping to find some guidance on establishing a Special Needs Trust. It is very basic and most of the information can easily be found on the internet. The Special Needs Trust Administration Manual is a much better reference.
2,You need a reference guide to make sense of this book!,"It's been 10 years since I earned my physics BS, and all that knowledge has faded a bit. I wanted a book that could sit on my bookshelf at work that would have summary information that covered the gamut of physics: from simple mechanics to E&M and quantum. If this is also what you wanted, then this is not the book for you. This book is badly organized, the information it presents is badly laid out, and there are surprisingly few illustrations. That's not to say it's all bad. If the world were about to end and you could only take a few books with you on the spaceship you constructed from recycled aluminum cans and bottle rockets, then this book would probably be one to take. Just make sure you bring along H&R and other familiar texts to make sense of it."
4,A fantastic overview of world history,"This book is a wonderful overview of world history. It tells you the basics of a subject, and if you are interested you can research more in depth. It goes through the stages of human development, and gives a great description of the cultures involved. I would definetly recommend this book to anyone that asked."
1,Flimsy,"I just received this portfolio today, and as soon as I touched the first page, I saw that the side seam was ripped for almost its entire length. I had barely touched it and, in fact, don't know whether it was ripped before I opened the package or only when I first touched it. The pages are too fragile, and I would not order this product again."
5,Good Inexpensive Portfoilo,I needed one of these bad boyz to showcase my artwork. Im trying to gain an aprentership for tattooing. Its inexpensive and decent quality.
1,worst BluRay ever,"This has got to be the worst sounding BluRay that I've ever watched. There is no bass, vocals are way too up front, A/V sync is off by more than my receiver can compensate for. A real disappointment for me.... a huge embarrassment for Springsteen. I can't believe that he allowed it to be released."
3,Hey!!!,"Hey,I like this book ALOT the only thing that was bad was the the words in the book that was not nice at all. But i like the rest of the book exsept the ending (it was real sad). But other than that it was so cool. SO all i have to say to cool readers is......READ THE BOOK (you'll like it)!"
4,Owl lovers vs. loggers,It's owl lovers vs. loggers who hate the spotted owl for putting them out of job. It's an amazing book by an amazing author about a boy whos father was a logger and he took in an owlet that was on the ground. You won't want to miss this!
5,So many lessons to learn from this book.,"I love this book and use it to begin the year with my 5th grade Reading class. There are so many things that can be learned about the book and it is very easy to hold their attention. This book deals with economics, science, social and political battles, upset adults, unemployment, children going to work to help family.. I could go on and on.At this particular time when many students actually know someone out of a job this book was even more effective this year. We have debates over saving the owls or saving the jobs. It can get pretty interesting what the students actually get out of just the few chapters. It draws on prior knowledge and answers so many questions that the students wanted to know and more. This is my 5th year to read this book and my students always ask....Is there a 2nd book?????"
3,I used this product on both my 2-1/2 ...,"I used this product on both my 2-1/2 year old girl and my 6-month-old boy. It has a nice smell and you need to use only a small amount to get a lot of lather. My daughter's hair is more normal to dry and fine. Usually she wakes up with """"bed head"""" even when we use a detangler and conditioner. This has been the only product that's made her hair soft and smooth. NO BED HEAD! Woo-hoo. As for my son, who has more normal skin and hair, this shampoo felt way too greasy. Overall, I'd recommend this product only to those who have dry or curly hair because it seems to be oilier than the typical Johnson & Johnson baby shampoo."
2,Deceiving advertisement!,"I received the bonsai in 3 days as promised. However, the tree is only about 8 inches tall (not 10 to 14 inches as stated) and the pot is a 6 inch round bowl (not 10 inch rectangular glazed pot as stated). I am very disappointed and will never buy trees from this seller again."
4,Ukulele Ike Sings Again,"Great Cliff Edwards singing with the Disney Wonderland Jazz Band (six pieces). Different than some of the classic older versions, much more dixieland style. Not as much ukulele playing as other Edwards recordings. When the ukulele is used it seems to be lost in the mix. It contains a great version of Jada. The overall sonic quality of the album is fantastic. The hidden track (number 17) is a special overdub of extra ukulele for the 45 rpm release. I paid about $5 for the CD at an online auction."
2,Could be better,Not easy to put together. Could not get the shelving to connect. There also isn't enough hanging folders. And from what i can see (been internet surfing) i can't find any more to buy anywhere. it would be a fantastic item if everything fit together and there was a way to buy more product.
3,Decent,"I had to find a case to hold my Jim Palmer autographed Orioles cap. For $15 this is a pretty good deal. The plastic is very clear and clean. However the bottom is quite annoying to get on and there is a little hole in the bottom that could potentially let dust in and build up. This is a good temporary fixture, but I think I will upgrade to a full glass cubed case eventually that is sealed closed. I am amazed at how quickly the product was delivered. Standard ground shipping from Florida only took about 3 days."
2,"Functional, but could be better.","I bought this to store and display an autographed hat. The quality of the plastic is less than ideal. When I opened the box, I was surprised to see the plastic somewhat cloudy and scratched. It was so cloudy that I thought there was one of those stick on protective covers over the plastic...unfortunately, that wasn't the case. This will work fine for storing the hat and keeping it in great shape, but if I want to display the hat i'm going to need to get something more presentable. The case just isn't presentation quality because you can see the scratches and scuffs."
3,Average at best,"This is a reasonably well written book, but the problem with it, is that it's a money making gig for Jessica. She is a very sad woman, and while it's an interesting insight into the life of a former great ball player, this is more of her own biography when really she is only 'famous' for being Jose's wife. Nothing she has ever done (from what she's written) has 'earned' her the right to write this book. I wish I hadn't bought it, because she gets my money and for what? Sure I get a one sided look into Jose's life, but she herself has never done anything important enough to read about. At the end of the book, she talks about how she's going to be developing her own line of skin care. Nowhere in the book does it mention that she is qualified for this or has training for this. Why would we buy such products from her? This confirms my theory that this book too, is just a money making gig because of who her ex husband is."
2,Poor Jose,"Poor Jose. Saddled with this moron. Any woman who feels compelled to discuss the intimate details of her sex life has no class. Clearly, she decided to marry Jose and spent enough of his money. Now she's married to a doctor (last I heard and no doubt they deserve each other) and Jose is broke. Again I say ""Poor Jose!"" meo"
3,Not Multi-Volt as stated on Mfr. website,"I purchased this shaver to take overseas and unfortunately it is not dual voltage as it claims to be on Remington's website. I only purchased this after downloading the user guide on their website which clearly shows it as 120-240 VAC 50-60Hz on pg. 11 of the user guide; what I received is only 120 Volt 60Hz. I'm not sure if I received an older model which has since been updated or if this is just an error; either way I have to return it. The shaver seems like it would've worked for my needs but I didn't get to use it. It's actually a lot smaller than I expected and comes with a travel pouch, a tiny brush and a small bottle of oil."
2,ehh...not so great,"Here is the deal....I bought this so that I could trim my body hair. And yes it works, but not too well. It takes forever to do a large area like say your chest. Partly because it is pretty small, and also because it somehow doesn't grab the hair too well. But, saying all that, I am still keeping it as a traveling groomer. It looks good, it seems to hold a charge very well, not too many parts, and it comes in a neat pouch. So for touch ups, or doing areas like your sideburns, or your pubic hair, then hey..it's fine. But if you are a looking to trim your leg hair, it's going to take 45 minutes."
4,pretty good,Works well for beard trimming. Holds a charge. Easy to clean. Haven't tried shaving with it because I never shave.
5,Great CD!,"Great Christmas celtic music! I would recommend it to celtic fans. And since it says I have to add 9 more words, I'm typing this extra sentence because I don't know what more to say about this CD. haha"
2,"Update: ""Not So"" rock solid AC",I've had this unit now for roughly a year and would certainly agree with the comments regarding the noise and the small evaporation tank; the fact that it claimed to be self evaporating is incredibly misleading. I use mine during the day in an office so emptying the tank is not as bad as it would be if I used the unit for a bedroom or gameroom which would be unacceptable. The noise prevents me from talking on the telephone since it sounds like a jet engine taking off while it's running. Bought it at Costco for less than [...] but will not ever make another purchase there without consulting Amazon first. I'm amending my original 5 star rating to a 2 star rating based on the fact that there has to be better units out there and it's obvious that I got what I paid for!
1,Do not buy this Item...,I was happy with both of my units at first although the drain plug is at the bottom of the unit and is hard to put a pan under it.I have owned the units a little over a year and the lower fan broke and parts of the inner unit started flying out of the vents of one. It will cost [...] to have someone fix it. I'm glad I was home because the fan that broke is what cools the unit who knows what could have happened if I was at work.The second unit donsn't blow cool air anymore and it will cost [...] to fix this unit. I have owned both for about 14 months.[...]..................Save yourself money and don't buy this unit.
1,NO GO - Royal Sovereign,"This may not be a fair review since I am commenting on different models of Royal Sovereign portable units. We made the mistake of purchasing four. Two arp 30125, one arp 1200de, one 900 series - all leak - two have been in the shop twice because they stopped cooling and repair was over $100.00 each - not to mention the hassle of transporting them to and from - one of which has just stopped cooling again and one only cools for a few hours before it vibrates so badly that it sounds like a jake brake on a tractor trailer truck - no exaggeration - the water has to be emptied before the sound stops - not good at 3 a.m. - they cool sufficiently but need to be in a work shop or somewhere with a pavement floor with a drain"
1,Wish I could tell you how it works,"Received air conditioner and 2 of the caster wheels were broke off. Have been trying to get the Royal Sovereign company to send out replacements, I have called the 800 number about 15 times. They do not return my phone calls. I have left several messages with all the information they could possibly need INCLUDING A RETURN PHONE NUMBER. So we have been really hot, as you can't use the unit. There are two metal prongs sticking out of the bottom without wheels, so have to place a thick pad under them just to keep unit in upright position and not scratch the floor. Tried to buy replacement wheels at hardware store, but none will fit this unit. So 3 weeks later am stuck with an expensive unit that we don't even know works or not. I think the company lacks customer support and after sale assistance. Would think again before buying this particular brand of air conditioner. Am getting pretty impatient waiting for something so easily shipped as 2 caster wheels!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS UNIT,WE BOUGHT THIS UNIT AND IT COOLS GREAT BUT AFTER ONLY THREE WEEKS.I WENT TO TURN ON THE UNIT AND IT MADE THIS TERRIBLE GRINDING SOUND AS IF THE FAN IS BROKEN.WILL SEND IT BACK FOR A FULL REFUND.
1,Don't Bother,"It is the end of July 2010 and we purchased this unit on February 3, 2010 -- LESS than 6 months ago. It is in a small bedroom and within a couple of weeks the fan made the horrific noise others have complained about in these reviews. I did the canned air thing and things seemed fine -- for a couple of months. Now the noise is back and the airflow is NON-EXISTENT -- no amount of canned air or tilting or speed changing is correcting these problems. The unit is now worthless and from I've read I won't even bother with trying to get the company to stand behind their product. I see Amazon has stopped carrying this model -- good for them.Sue Ann"
1,1 Star for the DVD; 5 stars for the film,"This excellent film has been transferred out of focus and improperly timed for color and light. When I saw this movie in a theater, I was very impressed with the overall visual quality of the picture, but the DVD looks overexposed and blurry, and the richness of the color has been lost. A huge disappointment..."
1,Tremendous Disappointment,"I am a fan of British film and like subtle humor and drama...but this! Well, first I should say that as far as ""family friendly"", this film is a gem. No profanity or any vulgarity at all plus a good story of 'right' triumphing over the system. But it was like the writers said, ""hey, lets take out all the intense, dramatic, exciting stuff out and just show them the boring conversation."" Subtlety is one thing, but this films takes the anticlimactic cake. The actors, fantastic...the cinematography...excellent. The directing...whoa...you have got to be kidding! The only phrase he could have possibly used to inspire these actors...""just be dispassionate"". Besides two good scenes, this movie barely held my interest. I kept thinking...""when is this movie going to start?"" and it never did."
5,Inspirational Read,"This book shows you just how evil the Europeans are towards America's superstar. Their jealousy is fully illustrated as the author discusses their relentless pursuit of doping charges.To get a glimpse of how this man overcame the ""Trolls"" and the naysayers provides inspiration for anyone who reads it.""Lance Armstrong's War"" is a great inside view of a talented hero."
3,Loved the story...,"I am a fan of the cyclist and enjoyed the book. Having said that, this author went a little over the top. The story speaks for itself, the excessive use of every superlative was unnecessary."
2,Old Book--New Edition,"This book has been out for years despite the copy right date. This is just the old book written a couple of years ago but now has a new section on the 2010 Tour de France. I got this book as a gift for my wife (she loves Lance) based on the copy right date. Come to find our she has the previous version which she alread read. I also got her Tour de Lance which covers the 2010 Tour de France.This book only had some minor new content. If you have not read the previous Lance Armstrong's War, this may be a good read for you.I sent it back because my wife said she was not going to read it."
1,Extraordinary? Hahah,Yes... this is the extraordinary history of one man cheating like if there was no tomorrow.... At least the truth came out recently.
3,"Careful....This is not ""livescribe""","Amazon is going to be selling the amazing new ""Livescribe"" pen. For some reason, searching Amazon for ""Livescribe"" brings up this older and much less capable device. Don't be fooled. (My 3-star rating is no reflection on this product, which I have never tried. You can't leave things unrated when posting a review, I think.)"
1,NOT compatible with Windows 7,"I wondered why this product was $86 and the identical product was over $200. My guess is that the $200 product is compatible with Windows 7, because the $86 product IS NOT. I have to return it and am disappointed."
3,writing memory,This item is great for making an exact digital copy of what you write. The paper is a little expensive and hard to find. The Hand writing recoginization software need a little to be desired but overallit is aokay
4,A complete Album from begining to end.,"I had the oppertunity to see them live this past summer at the Tattoo the Earth Festival, and was amazed at their power and stage presence. I had to buy the album, and I was very glad I did. Of all the newer mainstream albums this year, this is one of the best."
5,Great album,"If you've heard a song of theirs and liked it, get this album. Of the last 6 months, I've listened to this album the most."
4,Not too shabby,"Cold's 2nd album is one of my favorite new metal rock albums and far superior to their 1st CD. All of the songs are pretty good, but the series of 8 songs at the front of the album is the strongest. Highlights are ""Just Got Wicked"", ""She Said"", and ""End of the World"". Once you start listening to these songs, you can easily listen to the entire album. The melody and musicianship of this band is above average compared to their peers. They sound a little like Staind, but Cold is much, much better."
5,SCORE!!!!,"Cold is the best band (tied with Staind). They have the most touching lyrics I have ever heard and everything about them is just so great. They have respect for each other and respect for thier fans. I went to a Cold concert last night and it might have been a life changing experiance. Everything just clicked and fell into place. Scooter was so great and kind he actually bitched out the security because they were trying to take people off of the stage when they were crowd surfing and Scooter was just like ""Dudes calm down and let the fans have fun as long as no one gets hurt everything good I just want them to be happy and not get hurt. We respect them and they respect us."" It was just so awesome. Another thing the drummer can REALLY play. If you don't have this CD get it right now, if you don't have the self titled get that first...."
2,Cold - 13 Ways To Bleed Onstage,This was a terrible CD. The only song worth hearing is track # 1: Just Got Wicked. The other songs are clunkers. Don't waste your money on this. It's not worth it. Borrow it from a friend or burn some of the songs off a CD burner. But don't buy it.
1,Painful..,"I'm a big fan of the series, and I was excited to read this book because I thought Dalamar was an interesting character and hoped that a good portion of the story would have to do with the time he spend in the Tower of High Sorcery with Raistlin (my favorite character). Unfortunately the book ends at the door to the tower. And getting there was truly painful. I usually go through these books in a week while riding the train. This on I had to force myself to read just so I could get on with another book."
3,Angry Machines ~ Dio,"When I heard this album for the first time, I didn't thought so bad about it. I see all these bad reviews here saying this is even worser then Strange highways, but I didn't thought so then. But when I listened to it more, the album started to annoy me. Some songs are really annoying. These songs are Golden Rules, Dying In America and Big Sister. These songs got into my head, and it took a long time getting them out. The first 4 songs are pretty good. After those 4 good song you get Stay out of My Mind. I don't like the song because of the irritating long keyboard play. Other good songs are Double Monday and This is Your Life. The rest is very bad. And very irritating and annoying too! I hope Dio will never make an album like this again. This is Dio's weakest album, even weaker then Strange highways. I only recommend this to you if you are a diehard Dio fan. If you're new with Dio, you should begin with Holy Diver! I hope this review was helpful to you..."
2,Dio stuck in a rute,"Angry Machines is argualby slightly better than Strange Highways, but it still ain't nothing too great. Dio this time uses deeper, rawer sounding guitars, which is a good idea to try something new, but the songs are still slow and none of them really take off. I did respect Dio for trying something a little different (especially with his ""un-fantasy"" lyrics), but still the album isn't worth getting worked up about. Get only if your a Dio fanatic, because metal fans in general will be sorely disappointed. The cover art is great, but I don't get what it it and the title have to do with the album? Angry Machines? I don't remeber anything about machines on the album, but then again, I don't really remember listening to it. Still a cool cover."
4,Their next album might be 5 stars...,"This is a fantastic album by a band still feeling around for their own sound. As it stands LOVES A LONG SONG is a great collection of psychedic-tinged art rock that takes a lot of influence from 90's bands like Mercury Rev and Air as well as past bands like early 70's Pink Floyd. These guys know how to craft songs, the arrangements are very creative, and the mix is wonderful. A definate treat for those with higher-end sound systems. This is the kind of album that a fan of almost anything would like, and I expect that by the end of this decade, King Black Acid will be known as one of the heavy-hitters in the music world. Even though they have a few albums to their credit, I believe this one is the start of something big. -Mason"
5,Jakarta At Your Door,"If there's just one book to put in your rucksack on your travels to Jakarta, this is the one. It's obvious that the author not only knows his stuff, but loves Jakarta too! A winner!"
1,I wouldn't buy these again.,"Though these bars boast healthy incredients, they lack taste. The chocolate covered version has a lot more flavor. These taste almost rancid. Also, I wouldn't give this bar to one of my kids again. My four year old wanted one and he suffered diarrhea for nearly a week afterward. (We did not suffer the same consequence with the chocolate covered bars, leading me to wonder about this batch--I've thrown them out, despite reassurances from Zoe's)"
1,Yuck!,"I love the guilt free pleasue Zoe's Whole Grain Energy Bars provide. That being said, this flavor is YUCKY! I still have the box and can't make myself eat it."
1,Absolute Trash,"Zero stars. Not for the material covered in the video tapes, but for the fact that the videos are unplayable.I own a brand new DVD/VHS player and these tapes would not track properly no matter what I did. The sound was fudged as well.This is quite possibly the worst quality product I have ever purchased in my life. Do not waste your money. I wouldn't trust the DVD version either. I could have cleaned up this junk with my home PC movie software in an hour and put out a better product, and that is scary."
4,Car Top Carrier,"The carrier did exactly as was hoped - we traveled 1600 miles and all was dry and clean when we arrived. While I found the straps somewhat challenging to fasten so they would not make extra noise or whip around, it certainly can be done."
5,Soft pack roof top tag is excellent,"I bought this for a move from Wisconsin to Florida and it worked great. You can only fit so much into a Toyota Camry and this was perfect. It was very easy to put on and take off. I drove in 3 stages so in between I did take it off into the hotel or house I was staying at (without unpacking it) and had no problem. I packed my clothes into trash bags and threw them in the roof bag, I didn't pack it tight but I tightened the straps. I do not have a roof rack and it held great. I put the extra length of strap over the clip, otherwise it made weird noises and then closed the door on it. I never hit any rain but that's why I put clothes in plastic bags inside it. It never moved that I could see and although I could feel the weight it worked great. I highly recommend it. The price was great also. By the way the clips worked great that came with it I didn't have to do anything special"
1,It came apart!,Purchased this product and initially everything was fine but then it began to come apart! It didn't even make it back! The bag came undone at the zipper thank god that we had the bag stapped downwith extra straps we could have lost it all! I DO NO RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE!
4,Nice Roof Bag,This is a very nice roof bag. Just what I needed for the camping trip. It had enough storage for my extra things on my trip. The bottom part of the bag had a built-in foam on it which was nice and the straps are easy to install.
2,on off bar broke,It worked fine for 10 years but now the alarm will not turn on or off. This is the 4775/ab50 model which loks the same but was made in Germany.
3,Wasn't what I thought.,"Well the ending kind of sucked on this movie, never got to see the betrayal that took place, but the beginning of the war. Wasn't as good as I hoped for."
2,Hard story line to follow,The story line was slow developing and I had trouble identifying with the character groups as they intermingled throughout the story line.I would not pay to see this film at a movie house but for a quick down and dirty rentql it kills time.
5,underworld rise of the lycans,"Thought it was the best,because micheal wasn't in it. He was really weak to have a mixture of blood lines. The lycans were awesome!"
4,Russ' Lycan Review,"A good buy, not a great buy. Good story, but you really miss Seline (Kate Beckinsale):( Kate is why most of us started watching the Underworld series, but she leaves us for this one so we can get some history. BOOOOHHHH! A descent movie, will give a B+. Comparible to the 1st, not quite as good, definitely not as good as 2nd (Evolution)."
5,Fantastic,"After a very long wait for a third installment sony releases ""Rise of the Lycans"" and it hits the bullseye. One of the few good prequal films."
3,"Good Movie, Bluray Forces You To Watch Previews","The movie itself is quite entertaining, however, I am pissed off that they do not allow you to skip the previews on the Bluray. I would give it 4 stars otherwise.I didn't shell out extra money for the Bluray, just so they could force me to watch 5 minutes of previews."
3,Download The Firmware!,"I purchased the blue-ray version of this. I had the dvd version but picked up an HD LED television so I decided to upgrade some of my dvd's. My Panasonic DMP-BD60 blue-ray wouldn't play this disc. It needed new firmware for it to function. Had to go to Panasonics website, download the firmware to my computer then burn it to a cd-r. Then I loaded it into my player and ""BAM""! Just follow the instructions. It take's some effort. Just do it!"
4,So--now we know how the story begins,"Sometime before the original film, vampires ruled. Their labor came from lycan slaves. Lucian (Sheen) was the only lycan who was able to transform to human shape. Lucian is the favored slave of Viktor (Nighy) the vampire leader. He's also the undercover lover of Sonia (Nitra) Viktor's daughter.Lucian leads the Lycans against Viktor and the vamps when his love's destroyed. The fight, in true ""Underworld"" fashion takes place mostly with archaic weapons and a lot of blood and gore.It's difficult for me to review a prequel film, because I know what is going to happen. Still, ""Rise of the Lycans"" has well earned the right to stand on its own. The film's continuity is excellent with a strong look and feel like the original ""Underworld"" episode: very eerie bluish lighting and dark, even sounds the same.Rebecca Kyle, June 2009"
5,Watch this franchise in this order:,"If you have never seen the Underworld franchise, here is the order you should watch the films. First, watch this one. It is technically number three, but it should be number 0 because it happens before the first one. Then, watch the first one, since that was okay. Then, skip the other two, because they suck and don't bring much to the table, although if you REALLY insist you can watch the second one because she does get nekkid in that one. You can probably fast forward to the part though and ignore the rest of the movie. But don't watch the fourth one at all, it's boring and doesn't make sense and the lycans are sort of lame and scientisty and main vampire boobies chick has a kid (what) who looks like she's like 8 but she's probably 200 because, you know, vampire."
3,good customer service on my glitch,"I've had an awkward shopping experience with this seller, though their customer service to resolve the issue is amazing, very quick responses and helpful."
5,"Gorgeous music, gorgeous performances","I am a semi-professional singer with a BA in Music, and I bought this CD with some trepidation because it looked like one of those dreadful ""pop classical"" compilations that are everywhere lately. But it had lots of great repertoire all in on place, so I decided to risk it, and I was not disappointed! In fact, this is now one of my favorite choral CDs.As usual, the Choir of Trinity College delivers stunning performances, and the music itself is just gorgeous. Lots of ""church"" favorites from a wide range of musical periods. The mood of the CD is definitely on the mellow side, but it's perfect for those quiet moods. I love this CD -- highly recommended!"
1,Poor Rusalka,This is a very unfortunate presentation. You can buy this in Prague for about $12.- Even there it is stocked without customers. However it's in the reaL setting.
2,The Album Should Not Be In Your Home,"The castoff collection sounds just like a collection of b-Sides, which is, I suppose, what it is. The album is simply not as good as LJ's albums. Maria McKee's cowgirl posturing is off putting, and her screeching will make you beg for mercy. McKee is a great singer, but you'd never know it from this album. Everything here is a bit off kilter, if you doubt, compare her version of ""Way's To Be Wicked' with Tom Petty's vastly superior original. Stick with LJ's actual albums, or better yet, McKee's solo work."
5,Space Jam 1996,A fun video for any age tow atch. Having Michael Joprdan and Bugs Bunny plus his Looney Tunes group made this a fun picture.
1,This shipper is a very late shipper,I will NEVER shop from this shipper again. I have not gotten the item yet. They just sentit today and that is a shame cause i have ordered a lot of other items and got got all of other items and not have gotten this item. I hate this seller.
2,Disappointing,bad Quality.. it was fine to still watch it and its not HORRIBLE but the quality and resolution isnt the best
1,LESSON LEARN,I chose this rateing because the item I recieve was not what I order .After back and forth negotiation between the Seller we came to a compromise. But little did I know the item didnt work (was holding to send back). I sent it back anyway and have not hear from the Seller since. In short don't agree to a compromise no matter how good it sound without testing what you have on hand. TITLSpace Jam (Two-Disc Special Edition)
2,Space Jam-Enhanced Edition Still Denies Us A Widescreen Film,Attention! My rating is not intended for the film itself but for Warner Brother's decision not to give us a widescreen or letterboxed format of this movie. Anyone who has been holding out for a special edition of this film will only be half pleased when they realize the film is still shown in the pan and scan format. I understand this film is aimed at children and that they might not like it letterboxed but you could at least give us the choice like Columbia Tristar did when they released Stuart Little (both a pan and scan and a widescreen version were made available on DVD for this film). Come on WB! Get with the program!
1,PICTURE IS WRONG!!!,I was sent green life vests and they were suppose to be BLACK with a design on it. This was not the vest in the picture nor was in in the Large Main Title describing the vest. Green was in the very small print decription below all the main info. Be careful to read ALL the small print!
2,just ok,"not very good in terms of how it feels,a good back up at most, worth what i paid,it can save a life for cheap"
5,Love it,I can't get enough of this song. I am so glad they teamed up. They need to do more songs together because I love they way their voices go together. Well done
5,It's all about the pink,"I bought this as a housewarming gift for someone. As with all Cuisinart items, the quality is top-notch. That it's also pink (with a portion of the proceeds going towards Breast Cancer Research) prompted me to buy. In use it's similar to other ""winged"" corkscrews of similar construction. This is heavy and all metal of a very robust design."
2,Not what I hoped for...,"I give the book two stars because it's a creative idea and I really tried to like it but it's described as an erotic romance and the relationship has absolutley no tension or romantic build up, just sex. The characters fell flat for me and the descriptions were lacking."
4,"fun, energetic music","This music isn't meant to be brilliant, complex, or thought-inspiring. It's meant to make you bounce up and down and shriek along deliriously at the top of your lungs. In that goal, it succeeds beautifully. Though DHC is for the most part derivative, their dueling female vocalists add a touch of very welcome, and very well-crafted, innovation.Lockjaw is one of those albums you can listen to from first to last track without hitting the fast-forward button. That's mostly because the songs all use the same formula - snide lyrics, catchy riffing, some ska rhythm during the verses, and the standout vocals - and boy, does the formula work. If you sit still while listening to this album, there may be something wrong with you. Best track for me is Enough. Singing along has never been so fun.Also, I can not recommend seeing this band live enough. And if you're female, claw your way on stage to sing along with He Wants Me Back, one of the most affirming feminist anthems ever crafted!"
2,Kind of a dissapointment,"I used to listen to Mickey's Mousercise when I was a kid. It had this same cover, etc., so I figured it would be the same. It wasn't. Completely different singers & beats on songs, etc."
2,Shows more like a video for men,"It hardly showed any dance movements and most of the time was spent watch girls in closeups doing a few movements with some groaning. I'm sure some teenage boy would love this video, although it is very tame."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"When the watch arrived I was surprised at its size - definitely smaller than I had anticipated, especially the watch face. I was also not too pleased with the rather unconventional closure, which is quite stiff and rather difficult for one person to manage easily. It is an attractive watch for dress, but I will probably only use it occasionally."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I've enjoyed all of James W. Hall's novels and enjoyed ""Off The Chart"" as well. But this present effort isn't quite up to snuff. While Hall is a master of plot, this one has a few too many utterly implausible twists and some turns that simply don't overcome this reader's sense of credibility.Thorn, Hall's wonderfully crafted character, adds a few new problems and opportunities to his life in the form of Alexandra, a new romantic interest, and her doddering father who is introduced for reasons I don't quite fathom.The main villain, Vic Joy, is simply unbelievable.It's not a bad read: Hall keeps things moving along a quick pace and some of the scenes are tension producing. But overall, ""Off The Chart"" simply isn't up to the standard Hall himself has set with his earlier work. Still, for anyone who enjoys Hall's work or for those simply looking for a reasonably good adventure, I would recommend this novel - but with less vigor than I have for his prior work.Jerry"
2,implausible plot - annoying!,"I have enjoyed other James Hall books but the plot line in this one was so implausible, it was annoying. I finished the book, but I wish I hadn't."
3,it's OK,"I thought it would be actual tracing, but it was basically just drawing a line from point A to point B, kind of like a maze that's super-easy. My daughter is turning 4 in a month and is not excited about the book. It was fun for a night, but now it just sits there."
5,Excellent shoe!,"This shoe has been the best! My foot is very narrow and it fits me fine, my heel feels very secure. Also the roominess in the toes is great because I have a bone spur problem in my toe and most shoes really hurt it. I am very excited to have found these."
1,Disappointed,"My DD got it when she was 18mth for x-mas, she never was into it. The sound is too quiet, it doesnt do very much and all in all waste of good $25!"
5,"Amazing, epic work","I can't say enough good things about this cd. It is everything I thought it would be, and more! Therion are simply remarkable. All their stuff is amazing, even their early deathmetal is great. Anyone who is curious about metal with choir-like vocals (and definitely fans of bands like Nightwish... etc...) should buy this NOW! You won't be dissapointed! This has become one of my all time favorite cds. The fusion of different styles creates an amazing body of work. Highly reccommended.Great for any fans of powermetal or melodic metal... or music in general."
2,Mixture,I would have to say this is backed by a drum machine with slow talking to the beat. Sometimes they rap and sometimes they sing at the top of their lungs. It reminds me of women Beastie Boys and Morcheeba.
4,"'Quirky, yet fun!'","From the outset, this album may come across as being extremely quirky and unusual, but this only makes this album all the more interesting to listen to! What impressed about this album was it's originality and highly addictive beats. Each track seemingly has a 'story to tell' and therefore maintains interest throughout the duration of the album. From the ambience of 'Sugar Water' to the pulsations of 'Birthday Cake', there seems to be a song that represents every mood! Probably the only criticism is the recurrent theme of food which becomes a bit tiresome at times. Aside from that, this a highly creative album that certainly doesn't disappoint."
2,Marble madness meets short lifespan,"What is not appealing to building structures that allow a child to have fun being creative in creating courses to see some marble wind its way around and get to the destination, everyone remembers the game Mousetrap(tm) right? Kids make a course out of parts that glow in the dark to make it more interesting once the course is complete. However, the thing that plagues this product is its poor quality. Some children have a hard time building things to begin with as they focus to have a steady hand...now add cheap components to the mix. Eventually, one will try to connect some parts together and the *SNAP* will occur leaving the child with two pieces instead of one...both of which are now useless. Bottom line, even though it is neat to have a glow in the dark marble set, consider other alternative marble sets as there are plenty available. This one is lacking too much quality."
2,wrong color,"I bought a Michigan stand golf bag and these headcovers, both made by Datrek, but the headcovers were the wrong color blue. They were more of a royal blue instead of the dark blue that is the real Michigan blue. I kept them but not real happy they didn't match the bag."
5,Beethoven = God's music,Beethoven quartet op 131 is God's music. Listen to it very relaxed and then you will reach Nirvana. This Talich interpretation is the best one I've ever listened. Buy it with your eyes closed.
1,Masterpiece of trash...,"(...) With Burzum, I don't have too much to say. Varg Vikernes obvioulsy has some level of musical talent. I don't dispute that, musically, this album is up there with the other Norwegian Black Metal bands (I STILL think Emperor were the best musicians), full of aggression and mixing it with odd passages of beauty inspired by Norwegian folk and history. What ruins it is Vikernes' voice. Whereas Ihsahn shifts from operatic to evil screaming, and Attila Csihar sounds like he's gargling glass, (both of which are perfect for black metal) Varg's screaming vocals sound like a dying dog barking desperately to get attention before it expires. It's not singing, it's not even screaming, it's just a bunch of violent barks closer to death metal than black metal. Hate the man, not the music...a good statement, except that the man destroys the music, and thus turns what is a good black metal album into trash (in my ears anyway). (...)"
4,burzum are the best,it is a strong black metal with an unique sound. I recommand this album to all the fans.
5,"Useful, functional",I used this to connect my laptop to Austrilian plugs during my few trips there. Every time it worked great with good grip. I have no complaints. And it is cheaper than rivals.
1,Helmets!!,If you're looking for a book about information about the roman army from Hadrian to Constantine (as the title suggests) then you're looking at the wrong book. The majority of information in this book is on Hadrian's Wall (also most of the information is about roman army in Britain) and helmets. He is a British Roman army re-enactor and his work shows this in his very long boring descriptions of helmets & armour which could have been massively narrowed down. This just seems like a continuation of his other quite disappoiting osprey work The Roman Army from Caesar the Trajan. Osprey needs to update some of there works.
4,command performance,decent movie. thought is was a little too bloody. really don't think it needed all that. still a big fan! great soundtrack!
4,Not bad at all,I've seen just about all of Dolph's movies and this one is definitely one of his best. The action is great and for once he isn't a cop or some kind of ex secret agent. Oh and checking out Melissa Smith alone is well worth the movie!
4,Onc eupon a time there was a sheetrocker . . .,"who used to nail the rock in place. And he used a handsaw to cut his holes with!Yes, there was a life before spiral cut routers and screw guns.I still live in that realm sometimes.I have three of these kinds of saws. The one from Ace Hardware is a piece of junk (too many teeth). The Stanley is Okay, but my Goldblatt is the berries. I can never find it on the job because my helpers always latch onto it. They know which is the better tools too."
2,?????,"Cashing in on the name? I have Most of his solo stuff and personally this is the worst. The production is great, the band is good if not a bit tired, vocally it is weak."
2,An average book to pass the time with.,"Animist is an ok book to read. Not my first choice, but with a lack of anything else to read, I picked it up. It has an interesting premise, but the author fails to dazzle the reader with her words. Its a simple and quick read. Readers who are used to the likes of Robert Jordan, Frank Herbert, Robin Hobb - anyone whoe writes complex sci fi/fantasy will be disappointed. If you must read it, I would recommend getting it from a second hand book store."
5,don't stare at the album cover too long,path of debris is a cool band. don't look at the cover too long
1,The cover might look great but...,"The truth to be told, this is just pure crap from beginning to end. I bought it because I thought the cover looked great and thougth the movie would live up to it as well. Boy was I wrong!Its intentions was to give me a scare, but it had the total opposite effect. After 15 mins, it nearly put me to sleep. The acting is poor, the editing is laughable and the special effects are mediocre at best. These actors do not even put the slightest effort into making their characters believable and it makes me think that I did better at the school-play as a 14 year old. It's that bad. Our house got hit by the lightning halfway into the movie and removed all electricity, and as much as it was bad having our tv channels screwed up, I was relieved not having to keep watching this utterly stupid movie.My advice to you: Avoid this and spend your money on something better. Even the silliest movie I have with big Hollywood names is better than this piece of garbage."
1,They've all got it right... AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!,"I agree with most of the other reviewers, which is pretty easy with this one since this movie is so totally bad that it is almost laughable (if it wasn't so painful). Whatever you do, do not spend a penny on it. I accidentally just rented it for a second time (I guess I forgot that I'd seen it before - I think that was my brain trying to spare me from the post traumatic stress of having seen it previously). If you enjoy movies that are so bad that they are good, you'll still hate this one.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for..."
5,better than the TV show,and i very liked the show too !!. i remember seeing this book in the private collection of a professor at the university i worked at. so i took it home without his knowledge and read it. it was a very good read. light hearted but with a pleasant sadness.
2,Loss of time,"I almost laughed with the Villa-Lobos cantilena. The same with En Sourdine. This sort of music was meant to be sung by someone who sounds like a human being. If he wants to get into non-baroque repertoire, he should get some composer to write it for him."
4,A great novel for anyone to enjoy,I have read this book back in middle school and thought it was an excellent book. I liked it so much that I brought a copy of it and re-read it several times throughout my high school career. I thought the story development was really good and I could some what relate to a lot of the events that took place with Holland. I would recommend this book anyone who enjoys to read and just want to escape reality for a few hours.
5,Great Book,"I love this book, I read it back in high school. I think it's a great book for teens to read. I recommend it."
2,Too much of a bad thing,"The fault with this book is that it blows any sort of fear and interest out of the reader's mind before the storyline has even had time to set itself up. Instead of carefully leading us along, hinting at terrors and secrets to come, UNIVERSITY sucker punches you at the start, and simply continues to bludgeon you over the head with an over-done orgy of blood, sex, and evil. The theme of ""all-powerful evil"" in horror and suspense novels has been written right into the ground...and this book just doesn't have anything else to offer. By the way...the next time a horror author thinks he's going to surprise ANYONE with a cliched ending where the evil presence (or whatever)somehow survives, leaving us feeling like a tremendous waste of time just occurred--do us a favor, and unplug your word processor before you ruin what might be a good story."
4,Going to school has never been more fun!,"I have been an avid fan of Mr.Little's books since reading 'The Store'. His style of horror reminds me of the great's such as King and Koontz, maybe sometimes even a little more bizarre, such as the imagery projected in 'University'. I believe it was Stephen King who wrote on the differences between haunted dwellings and evil dwellings. This one definitely falls in the latter category. I may venture to say it even delivers more by making the actual dwelling an entity itself and the evil contained within representing the cancerous cells which effect the overall character of the place. No throwing of Holy water by a priest this time, but only an invasive attack from within could still this monster. I won't spoil it by describing how, because It would be a mistake for the reader not to peruse this for themselves. The trip along the way is loads of fun as well! For the reader who likes their horror served up with a side dish of surrealism, this one is it!"
1,Cheap Quality,"I don't dare use it. Most the items in the first aid kit are foreign made (China) and look unsanitary. Some items (gauze and gloves) even look used! Overall, the whole kit has a very ""cheap"" and ""low quality"" feel. It can't be returned either. Avoid!"
1,Don't waste your time.,Terrible acting and story.Never went far enough into to finish it.Had a hopeful story line but you couldn't sit through it.
4,Last Kung Fu Monk,I have always liked Asian Martial Art movies. This one was better than anticipated. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
4,Super Value,"We have been ordering these wipes for almost a year. After trying nearly every kind in the store, we saw this product on line and decided to give it a try. Now that our son is older, we use so many wipes, that it is silly and overwhelming if we don't buy them in bulk. Sometimes the web also offers coupons you can use online. These wipes are MUCH cheaper than the huggies, and of better quality. (Huggies- 4.8 cents ea. Luvs- 2.8 cents each)"
2,Luvs wipes,The wipes are very thin. You have to use 3-4 wipes everytime you use them. I'll stick with the Huggies from now on.
4,Not bad,"I read some negative reviews on these wipes, but decided to try them anyway. They aren't as thick as Huggies or Pampers wipes, however, when I reach for the wipes, I typically grab a couple at a time, no matter the thickness. I guess I have a phobia of getting anything gross on my hands. So, I figure if I am going to use two wipes at a time rather than one anyway, these being slightly thinner is okay and more economical. One or more reviewers said these weren't very wet; it is very easy to add a bit of water to the container of wipes."
4,A good general map,"If you ever feel like going somewhere, but you're not sure where, this is a good map to buy. It's got all of the southwestern states, and it features good enough detail that you could successfully just start driving with nothing but this in your pocket and get somewhere cool.The ocean.New Orleans.New Mexico.Some isolated crater in Nevada.A deep valley, or a deeper canyon.This is the sort of map you get to keep always in your glove compartment just in case, or to spread out on your living room floor and fantasize about.The places you could go.The mountains you could climb.The diners you could get sick at.This is a key to all of them."
1,AMAZON / LIVGREN RIP-OFF CDR!!!! BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!,MUSIC ASIDE THIS IS A CD-R AND NOWHERE ON THE DESCRIPTION DOES AMAZON CITE THIS. HELL I CAN DOWNLOAD MY OWN CD-R IF I WANTED A DAMN CD-R FOR FREE! THIS IS WHERE AMAZON AND THE ARTIST SCREW US CONSUMERS AND LEADS MANY TO FREE DOWNLOADING THAT THEY ALL WHINE ABOUT! I'LL BE SURE TO SPARE MY FRIENDS AND GIVE THIS AWAY FOR FREE SINCE AMAZON WON'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND OFFER A REFUND AFTER SPEAKING TO SOMEONE IN THEIR INDIA CALL CENTER!
3,selected poems and letters of E. Dickinson,Anything regarding Emily Dickinson is a must read for me. However this was one I had not read and got it as a gift. Was disappointed as many top poems were not included. Still it was a lovely text.
2,A Scary Guy,"I wish this book were a work of fiction, rather than a collection of real events. Sir John came across as a dominant who hadn't done his homework. He seems to take advantage of women who are not in this best of mental health, and worse, he practices very unsafe BDSM. I was stunned at his leaving submissives alone for too long while in bondage, at his non-use of ""safe words,"" let alone practicing safe sex, and for not really knowing what he was doing when using a variety of instruments.That said, if you like a sadistic dominant, you will probably like this book. If it had been just a sexy S/M novel, I would have enjoyed it more...."
4,Interesting read,"A very interesting book on what Burgoyne did right and what he did wrong to become ""The Man who Lost America."" Well-written and a worthy read to anyone interested in the American Revolution."
2,"Solid first effort, but they didn't find their sound yet","On ""The Stings of Conscience"", I think Unearth started out solid. It's very rare that a band's first album is their best. You're usually younger, less experienced, and haven't mastered your instrument yet. These guys are great in regards to their instruments on this debut record, but I think they hadn't mastered their songwriting skills yet. The vocals are okay, but Trevor really steps it up on the next record. I think ""The Oncoming Storm"" is where Unearth really found their niche. They wrote great songs, shaped their sound into something powerful and forceful, and displayed incredible musicianship. ""The Stings of Conscience"" is great jumping-off point, but don't expect to be wowed right away. There are really only a few songs that I think can come ALMOST close to the quality of the stuff they've done since. Check it out though if you're a fan that hasn't heard their older stuff."
4,Wonderful album,This album is a great album. Unearth to me remains one of the few amazing American metal bands. The album is loud and fast and flawless all the way through. I would have given this album 5 stars but one of their other album The Oncoming Storm is an absolute metal masterpiece. My Heart Bleeds No Longer is a wonderful intro to a great album. Shattered by the Sun is also a great song to help close out the album. Not a perfect album but still amazing. Great American metal.
3,"A Grade ""H"" Tape","HALF-WITS HOLIDAY (1946) is a very hard short to watch. Curly, who was ill at the time, suffered another stroke during the filming of this short, and was taken to the hospital while Moe, Larry, and the crew finished filming without Curly. Curly's absense in the rest of the film is too noticeable, and it's hard to watch this knowing what happened to poor Curly. The film is a HOI POLLOI (1935), and that one is better.HORSES' COLLARS (1935) - . An early Stooge short and I never liked this one that much because it's a Western. But Curly going wild whenever seeing a mouse, and uttering that classic line, ""Moe, Larry, the cheese"" makes this worth watching.HOW HIGH IS UP? (1940 is a gem. Most of the short is plotless, but the boys keep it interesting with funny gags, and it gets even better in the second half when the boys are on the 97th story. Wonderful work."
2,Great Case but Dismal Sound Quality,"I purchased this Portable Field CD Stereo as a gift for a family member. After I received it, I plugged it in to make sure every-thing was in working order. I'm glad I did. All of the controls were working & nothing was broken, however I was greatly disappointed by the sound quality- - So much so that I decided not to give this item as a gift. There was only one toggle switch for tone (or base/treble)- High or Low). The speakers were cheap sounding. The toggle & push button controls fit right in (visually) with the design of an aircraft control panel but were in fact of cheap quality. The heavy AC adapter was bulky. The unit should've come with a standard power supply and standard AC plug. What you're paying for here is the fancy case. The case is well built and of good quality-- it's just the most important part (the audio system inside) is junk and sounds like it. Use the $250.00 to buy something else. If it wasn't for the case I'd rate this as 1 star only."
2,There are much better options out there,"I agree with a previous reviewer that these bars are waxy and awkward in taste - there is definitely only a hint of peanut butter and the rest of the mouthfeel is filler. I bought two cases on sale and keep them in a drawer at work for when I'm trying to fight off the urge to hit the vending machine, but I can't give these away, and only eat them myself because I've already paid for them and they're better for me than a Snickers."
2,Nothing Special,"Very average-tasting bars, nothing special and not all that high in protean. Would not buy again."
5,"The breaking of the seven seals, courtesy of Dostoevsky","This books improves upon the Divine Comedy and revives the New Testament. This book is a bible of Dionysiac dismemberment. Dostoevsky has translated Job's Jehova for us, from the original thunder."
4,Great toolbox saw.,I have had the older version of this saw for about 30 years. Even now with all kinds of cordless tools this is a great saw to have in the toolbox. It can get into places that other saws can't and cut with finesse. Wish I could still get new blades to fit the handle I have (model # H1275).
3,Not as expected,"The Otter Box came in excellent condition, but it was not the model shown in the picture. It's the one without the foam blocks."
1,i dont think this is good,has some bugs.needs to be improved.no staff notation.no expression marks.needs more sound variation.
3,Alias review,"The book Alias started out really great, i just couldn't put it down, but then things started getting really boring, and it was almost as if i didn't want to read it at all. Near the middle of the book is where it just was horrible. the words, and contents sounded as if it was written by a 13 year old, i am dead serious. it sounded as if something i may write. ussually the books i get written by adults (which most are) they are wonderful, but this one, the words were dull, as well as the sentance structure. Ryan used dull, simple, plain sentences. example: the boy ran into the house. (you could've used) quickly, the tall, lean, tan boy charged into the red brick house. now, tell me, doesn't that sound much better?"
1,"Oh god, this is just awful","The one model who fits the description is Erica Campbell, and her entire short scene is spent in extreme closeup ' is that a thigh or an elbow... oh, look, it's a freakin' FOOT! That's real sexy. Not. If you like this, then you're probably already dead. If you don't, then there's hope. Just a bunch of women slowly, softly stripping windy layers off until you're deeply disappointed. This is the kind of ripoff that gives capitalism a bad name. Save your lousy $10 and throw it in the trash instead."
1,Make of this what you will,"Report from the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health""Identification of Personal Lubricants That Can Cause Rectal Epithelial Cell Damage and Enhance HIV Type 1 Replication in Vitro""[...]"
3,"A good, if messy lube","We ran out of lube after buying the Condom Lover's Wild Weekend pack, and needed to buy more. We received a few samples of this brand, so I bought it. It does it's job admirably, but it does leave something of a mess. I don't know if this is a default with the product, or if I'm just squeezing too much out. Anyhow, while clean up can be a hassle, it's still a good lube to use. Keep some tissues nearby though."
2,Doesn't last long,"Unless you're the type of guy who only needs a few minutes, you'd be better off with liquid silk or maximus. Astroglide starts to get sticky pretty quick. Really annoying for a marathon 30 minute++ session with your sweetie."
4,GREAT BOOK!,"THE ONLY THING I DID NOT LIKE IT, IS THE SMALL LETTERS. YOU GET TIRE AFTER A WHILE OF READING."
2,Archaic and Anti-Semitic,"Do not buy this book. It's another archaic off-copyright piece of junk that Amazon uses to fill out its Kindle offerings. The translation is stilted and old-fashioned. I've seen better in print (see Penguin edition in paperback, not available on Kindle). And if you are a Jew, and perhaps even if you are not, you will be offended by translator notes including gems such as ""the tragedies that befell the Jews were the fulfillment of prophecy -- punishment for the murderers of our saviour.""Amazon, please remove this volume."
4,I like,"the whole series and all the riffs in the series that Jackson takes. Jackson is not Elmore Leonard, but they share the common trait of making even minor characters memorable and Jackson always keeps the dialog fresh."
5,Every mom should have this book,"A friend's friend got this book at her birthday party, she read it out loud, we were all crying, later my friend bought one for me. I have bought and given away about 6, and have a list of about another 6 I want to give. It's just so sweet, so truthful, every mom identifies with it. Every son/daughter feel also moved."
1,Not a how-to-guide,"If you want to know how to make realistic paper flowers, this book is not for you. It will show you how to create the campy, fake looking flowers kids and young people might have made in 1960's USA, but if what you want is to make realistic paper flowers, for decorative use, that you can really be proud of, I suggest you look elsewhere. photos are mostly black and white, and instructions are not clear."
4,Lilia,Wow this book was great!!!!!!!!I never thought this book was great.Thanks Richard Carlson hope I get to read other one of your books
4,Smashing Spinoff,"The makers of ""Night of Dark Shadows"" had to be pretty creative when some of their series regulars balked at appearing in another big screen installment. Give credit where credit is due this film doesn't reach the heights of ""House of Dark Shadows"" but is reasonably spellbinding. Instead of recreating an episode of the serial the makers create a whole new universe and series regulars(Grayson Hall, John Karlen, Thayer David et al) play completely different characters. David Selby's darkly brooding Quentin Collins is not the werewolf he's better known as but a man possessed by spirits of Collinwood past. Lara Parker also contributes as the sultry ethereal witch Angelique. Whereas the preceding film took its cues from Hammer ""Night of Dark Shadows"" is more like a supernatural gothic horror film. What it reminds me of is a later film by series creator Dan Curtis, ""Burnt Offerings"". ""Night of Dark Shadows"" feels like a dry run to ""Burnt Offerings""."
4,Night of Dark Shadows (VHS),Another blast to the past and what a ride. I remember running home from school to catch the Dark Shadows soap back in the 60's. Great memories. Arrived in good condition and quickly.
4,Great melodrama and horror,This movie brought back some great memories. I have enjoyed watching the dark shadows soap when it was on during my years in junior high.
3,The more interesting of the two original DS films.,"This is certainly not a great film. It has many problems, most of which are probably due to the last-minute cuts that Dan Curtis was forced to make. However, I think it is actually much more interesting and original than the first film, House of Dark Shadows. Visually, this film is far superior. There are some great moments that make me sad that the final product just doesn't live up to what could have easily been.The fact that this particular release has almost no special features makes me upset that it wasn't put on the same disc as House of Dark Shadows. They should have put both films on one disc at a lesser price. Also, the fact that the promised lost footage will not be present makes me completely uninterested in this release. Hopefully they will do another release in the future and will have found the sound to the missing footage by that time!Unless you haven't seen this film, avoid this release. Wait until they get it right."
5,Very Scary Night!,"This was Kate Jackson's first movie and she is wonderful in it. When she joined the TV soap opera it was quite a nice improvement to an already good cast. In some ways her presence made up for having lost Alexandra Moltke's Victoria Winters character, since they were somewhat similar. The over all tone of this movie is very gothic and mysterious like it should be. David Selby's performance is another strong reason to love this movie. The plotline was actually not original, since the TV series had a parallel time storyline that involved Quentin returning to Collinwood with a new bride who had to deal with the ghost of Angelique. But it doesn't matter because it still managed to capture much of the soap opera's original flavor by borrowing another story from the TV series. The flashbacks between the present and the past also added much dimension to the script. This was a nice piece of nostalgia for any fan of the original series..."
3,"insightful articles, at times difficult and academic","It has some good articles... but at times it is hard to read, like a textbook written in greek, rather than in plain simple english.also, while I was looking as Nash Solution in Game Theory, I found that the tables are missing! How could that be!Then I joined the 90 day online trial, which required a credit card... depending on people to forget about the subscription and earn money from that... what a good and not so moral strategy... interestingly, the online content contains the missing tables... and it costs $25 per year. So it might be better just to subscribe to the online version, and be able to find articles any where you are with an online computer.also the DVD-ROM version doesn't let you copy the whole article to Word or Notepad with ease. You need to do it screenful by screenful. The online version is just a webpage and allows easy copying to Word or Notepad."
4,teva flip flop,I have settled for a size 8 (which is too big on my size 7 foot) because the size 7 I ordered was sized like a 6. This is the first time my Teva flip flop wasn't perfect. Returning gets to be a pain so I slop around in too big sandals to avoid another trip to the post office. I truly love my collection of Teva flip flops.
5,Worth every penny!!,"These flip-flops are the third pair of Tevas I have ordered (need different colors as fashion statements). I do plan on ordering more colors as these are the most comfortable flip-flops ever designed. They are so light weight and comfortable, they need no break in period. Their only flaw: I can't wear them to work as they are not considered ""proper work attire."" I will never purchase any other flip-flop but the Teva Mush."
3,too soft,The sandle itself is very pretty and I love the width of the strap and the design. I did not like to softness of the pad of the sandle. I have several Teva sandles in my closet and none of them are soft like this sandle. My heal and back started to hurt after wearing this sandle for a few hours. It would have been perfect if the pad was harder. I will only wear these if I know I won't be on my feet long.
5,Love These Flip-Flops!,"I bought a pair of black Teva Mush flip flops almost two years ago just on a whim and they're easily one of the best shoe purchases I've ever made. They're squishy, comfy and I've never had a problem with the strap rubbing a blister. I wear these almost exclusively during the summer and during the warm Texas Spring/Fall. Mine have squished down flat at the heel after all that wear but it's a small price to pay for the comfort. Really, my only compaint is that if they get wet the insides get slippery on your bare feet. Not enough of a compaint to justify giving it only 4 stars!"
2,Nice shoe RUN REALLY SMALL,"I usally wear and 8 1/2 and based on other reviews I picked the size down (an 8) instead of the size up. Big mistake! The eight is tiny, fits more like a 7. So I'm out the shipping fee to return these and I bought two pair, :-{"
3,"Zurich Time watch box 20 watshes, see thru box","The watch box looks nice and the price is OK, but the pillows for the watches are to small for the compartments and this causes a sloppy fit. Also the the lower compartment does not have enough height and you can only use it for very thin watches. In conclusion box looks nice but is only good for small/thin watches."
4,Purity of Sound Is Keane,"All of a sudden, there is a multitude of CD's featuring Celtic music - particularly female singers. This collection touches many bases, in addition to traditional Irish tunes - take a listen to ""Lili Marlene."" My favorite track on the CD is ""Died For Love,"" the story of ill-fated lovers. The guitarist is outstanding and wraps his sparse licks around Keane's crystal-clear vocal like a lover's tender embrace. There's even a track that could have been cut in Nashville - ""Foolish You"" - that's about as country as you can get! If it weren't for Keane's strong brogue, you'd swear it was recorded within earshot of the Ryman! A great outing all the way around."
3,it's OK,"It was an okay costume. It doesn't look too cheap at night. But I have to complain about the sizing of this costume. I ordered a size small, but it ran freakishly small at the bosom, and disproportionally large at my waist and butt. I used pins to fix the waist, but the top was so small, it ran up high and I felt like my throat was being strangled."
4,sexy but beware!,"I got this costume in the mail, I must say that I LOVE how it looks. Fits a bit big around the back are, and I ordered a small. But that's so minor, I don't care. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars, which isn't mentioned in any of the reviews, is that the gold fabric is so fine that it's fragile. I lightly grazed the costume on the corner of my kitchen counter and with my ring while trying it on and it put a run in the fabric. I was dissapointed about it. Such a beautiful costome, but such cheap fabric quality. It was $36 so I guess you get what you pay for and its totally worth it. If you're going to a rowdy party or an outdoor halloween walk, just becareful."
5,Weber kabob set,"If you like Kabobs, you must have this set! Nothing sticks to the grill. All food is cooked evenly and not burned. Try cooking scallops and prawns. Wow!!"
4,Rosette Irons,My mother used to use these irons to make Rosette's and I wanted to try it since the end result is so good. They were easy to use and I make two at a time using 2 different irons.
4,"Good quality rosette irons, like the different themes.","I have a growing collection of rosette irons, and these were a great winter addtion to them. And it is alway nice to have an extra handle lying around to do multiple shapes with the same batch of batter."
2,Avoid the Blackberry download.,"I am sure that this is a good product, however, I do not recommend downloading it to a BlackBerry Storm. The text is entirely too small and the program locks up quite often. I finally removed it."
5,A TRULY ENGAGING READ!,"If you have ever loved someone with your entire being and then discovered they were not who you thought they were you will relate to this book. I couldn't put it down and read it in one day. Her characters were extremely believable, likable and real enough to grieve for. A wonderful read that isn't easily classified as mystery or fiction. Drama is the best category for this book. A great read on a winter night by the fire with a cup of herbal tea..."
1,Ignorance,"I'll start off by saying that I once felt as the author does. I felt AA failed me. I've since started going to meetings that focus on working the 12 steps exactly the way the book Alcoholics Anonymous outlines, not through Hazleton, the 12&12, some rehab's idea other the multitude of other misguided approachs that leave WAY too much room for interpretation. I actually did what the book Alcoholics Anonymous says and have since recovered. I used to the same way she did; confused, discouraged and resentful. Unfortunately most people are unaware that the directions on how to work the 12 steps are outlined in the ""big book"" so they buy supplemental guides etc.. which fail many people. I feel sad that the message of AA is construed and that people like the author become misinformed and fail then air their resentments and add to the problem of misinforming others about the program and AA's fellowship."
1,Please don't give up on aa,"I feel this book is very unhelpful to those considering a 12 step program. The ""limited confines of the herd mentality of aa and other 12 step-programs"" is completely in your OWN mind.AA is the most freeing of recovery programs; aa DOES NOT limit you to anything except a desire to stop drinking. There are NO rules, ONLY suggestions. Take them or leave them, but if you do decide to follow these suggestions i promise you will not regret it.If you are in a 12 step program and still miserable ask yourself these questions: do you have a sponsor? if you sponsor yourself you have a fool of a sponsor. how long have you given aa? it takes time to heal.I hope that this book does not discourage those seeking recovery to shy away from aa. You would be missing out on what could not only save your life, but make it worthwhile."
3,Show them your light!,"First of all the title is quite overwhelming for people who are looking for some comfort when dealing with addictions. I have been on a spiritual self seeking journey for over ten years and have recently discovered that alot of the low self esteem that I harboured was related to alcholism. I have read books from Louise Hay, Marianne Williamson, Bernie Segeal, A Course in Miracles, Leanord Orr, Sondra Ray to name a few. I have been in fellowship with Al-Anon and AA. I can understand how you could have felt without the same spiritual background. I can see these programs updating themselves to conform to the outside teachings of all these wonderful teachers. If you have such knowledge of self worth my suggestion to you is to get back into these programs and help the struggling addicts to see the light that you have found. You would be doing the planet a great service."
5,"the cd is great, but...","I love this cd, it's just like the original, but with more songs. Now, I don't know if Amazon will put this on their site, but if they do, it's not like they are going to lose a lot of money. You can buy this cd at a regualr cd store a lot cheaper. Usually Amazon has prices you can't beat, but not this time. I got mine for like 18 bucks."
1,"Good luck, you are going to need it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",This is a piece of junk. The only pictures I ever could get into the product were scanned pictures. I tried every way I knew to get pictures out of Adobe Photoshop Elements 3 to burn a DVD. Forget it. Their customer service is non-existent. I just ordered Ulead Picture Show 4. I hope it works.JRC
2,The Civil War; Volume 3: The Narrative Red River to Part A,"Very disappointing to find that Shelby Foote does not read his own work. Instead, the entire masterpiece is read by the Jellystone Park ranger from Yogi Bear. Can't concentrate on anything he says without listening for Boo Boo and the pickinic basket. Not worth the price. Would have been priceless if Shelby had read this work of art."
3,I don't know... not great... okay...,"I read Island of the Blue Dolphins and loved it, so I tried the sequel, Zia. I must say, I was somewhat dissappointed with Zia and didn't like it nearly as well as I liked Island of the Blue Dolphins.Many books I read a few times, like I've read Island of the Blue Dolphins about three times and have never gotten at all bored with it, but I've read Zia only once and don't plan on reading it again."
2,Anxious,"Reading this book just makes me exremely anxious... I don't know why.. Maybe its because it just talks about a bunch of stuff that I'm already aware of.. i would rather opt for an interesting story that shows this rather than a bunch of essays. However, if you're into trade and want to sharpen up your knowledge on it, this book is for you."
2,"Music only...hoping for instructions to workout for kiddo, too","This is music only. It is not teaching your kid about working out or explaining moves to do for a workout. I was hoping for the old, mousercise routine."
3,"Nice smell , but does not get rid of dandruff","This dandruff like all other herbal essence shampoo have really seductive smells, however, I wash my hair twice a day with this, but still, my dandruff is not going away. I remember with H & S, there was no cool smell or nice bottle design, but it very effective at getting rid of dandruff.Anyway, it's crazy buying shampoo online, however, with Amazon Prime, I get everything second day shipping."
5,An excellent story for all ages!,"This book was recommended to two friends of mine who are librarians. I'm so glad they sent it my way! It was a quick read, but it is definitely a story I could read over and over again. Mystery, romance, and a touch of the supernatural all combine to form a page turning story. I don't want to spoil any of the plot points nor can I express it better than my fellow reviews, but I just had to say how wonderful this book is - no matter how old you are!"
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK,"wow i can't explain how great this book was for me. amazing. a tale of a troubled teen in england who discovers her mother's secret past. While uncovering the hidden details of her unknown ancestry Clare learns of her own future, meeting relatives, and falling in love. If you want to stay up all night reading a great book read this."
5,Fascinating read,"This wasn't masterfully written, but it was frequently breathtaking, and what a fascinating world she creates!She combines the fated feeling almost of a horror story - ""once you enter, you can't leave"" - with a romantic story seasoned with ancient Celtic customs and standing stones.The authenticity, completeness, intricacy, and creativity of her world makes this book well worth the read. If you have any interest in Celtic mysticism, ancient indigenous religions, or heroes tall, dark, and enigmatic, you must read this book. Very satisfying and thought-provoking, exciting, and intriguing."
5,Awesome subs!,these subs are awesome!! the most you will have to do is buy new wireing kit so the subs could work properly. other then that they hit hard!! i recomend them to anyone
2,Spend more for the real bristle blocks,"I wanted Bristle Blocks, but didn't want to pay the high price, so ordered these Krinkles, but I don't like them. They don't stick together right and the kids get frustrated because they keep falling apart. My advice: spend more and get the real thing. These are a waste."
5,Preschool must-have,Well made and fits together easily. This toys is a preschool must-have and lasts for years through various developmental stages. A good value for a great toy.
2,lack of instruction clarity,"If your toilet has any rust in it (which often is the case from rusty bolts holding the tank to the bowl), the test will cause a false positive. This should be mentioned in their instruction brochure."
3,Not good for latex allergy,"I tried both the tan and the clear, hoping that one would work for me. Unfortunately, they both caused a rash across my nose that lasted more than a day. I gave them 3 stars because I can see how this product would help someone with breathing difficulties, but if you have a latex allergy, they do more harm than good."
2,Ridiculous charge for peace of plastic.,"I think it is a crime to gain a wealth by patenting a product that can benefit or correct health condition. Yes, nasal strips do work, but unfortunately I can't get them from honest manufacturer, but crooks."
4,Exhilarating - A world of detail,"The fantasy art of Josephine Wall is innocent in subject, with a touch of the abstract, and often rich in detail.SPECIFICS:Page Count: 128Number of images: 118Small images: 5Half page images: 45Full page images: 642-page spreads: 4BW images: 0TEXT:Foreword: 1 pageIntroduction: 1 pageThanks and apologies: 1 pageMost of the paintings have a small paragraph with comments by the artist.Title, real size, year and medium used for every painting.ART:25 images: 5 stars62 images: 4 stars31 images: 3 stars0 images: 2 stars0 images: 1 starOverall: 4 Stars"
3,Pretty much what I though it might be.............,"Pictures are beautiful, informative information, would like to see more work by artist. I have a few of her prints and I enjoy them tremendously!"
1,I'd give it a zero if possible.,"I have not one, two, but three of these pieces of junk and have finally learned my lesson. The first one was DOA out of the box. The second one developed a USB connection problem within one month. And now the third one flashes continuously ""check cartridges"" and I have put brand new ones in there. It won't even scan or copy when it thinks you have printing issues. You're just locked up with a bunch of flashing lights. Don't waste your time with this thing. I'm definitely going to try a canon next."
2,The Printer That Ate My Computer,"After I installed my HP PSC 1315 about one year ago, I could not run my Jasc software programs. I could not use my Epson Stylus C60 as an alternative printer, although it remained installed with my computer. The HP PSC 1315 photo sharing progrm (Snapfish) required RECIPIENTS of photos to log in (even my daughter refused). Yesterday was the end, as the HP PSC 1315's malfunctioning (after one year) caused me to spend hours of my time trying to fix it by uninstalling and reinstalling the software. It would not reinstall successfully, so I uninstalled and am junking the machine. Until recently, the print quality was pretty good, but the quality has been going downhill recently. After not using my Epson Stylus C60 (about 5 years old) for a year (as the 1315 wouldn't allow it), I tried it today and, although it needed new ink cartridges, it worked perfectly. So, I'm purchasing an Epson all-in-one. I will never purchase an HP printer again - the 1315 has frightened me off."
1,PC Load Letter? What the *$%& does that mean?,"I hate this printer. I got it super cheap when a local Circuit City closed down and sold off floor models. I design business cards, pamplets, etc. on my computer as a side business while going to college and suffice to say, printing them on this printer can't happen. Nothing lines up correctly. It completly ignores the margins I've set. Everything prints at a slanted angle. And then to make it even better, it will print say 3 pages perfect and then never print it right again. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER if you need it to print on anything other than standard paper. It will not do it."
1,The worst printer,"Do not buy it, it simply do not work, the problem?? The drivers.go for an epson or lexmark or whatever. Don't waste your time and money.I know that the people from HP will not recognize it, but they know I am telling you the truth.It is a shame, how a company that says they are the best, can make a printer with the lower quality control. Again it is a shame."
2,Very hard to read,"This book may be informative, but I think it is way too informative. How so? It is describing martial arts movement. I don't know about you, but reading how a hand moves or how a weapon moves is very hard to follow. These things are meant to be seen. Some topics like the history and the philosophy makes good reading, but when the author becomes too descriptive with the techniques, it becomes very difficult to follow. Also, the style of writing does not make it easier to read either."
4,bean bag toss,The bean bag toss is a great game but is extremely hard to assemble. The plastic joints that the metal pieces go on broke as I was trying to assemble. nGame is a good game but just needs to be easier to put together.
3,Very cheap made.,Very cheap made. It broke the first day it was played. I do have to say though the company reimbursed me the money.
4,Very Business practical Book,"Communicating with others is a key success factor that this book brings in a journey way to the reader..If more than the book itself, the reader has other skills, like my case, I found myself discovering the well organized process while am matching realities and the author inspiration... this book is an average reference for advance reader in Business, but very effective for any public or private communicator that today business market require... I realize many changes just from the day i start reading it... Amazon did great to make available books like this...You should read it.."
4,The Best!!,"I am a huge fan of Kristin, from Charlie Brown to A New Brain, to this. She has an amazing character voice that is so enjoyable to listen to and so hilarious. She can do anything! Her new sitcom is great, so cute! Everyone should watch it, she's like a young Dolly Parton, but if you don't like Dolly, she's not really."
4,"'30's and '40's songs suit her fine, but...","I love Kristin Chenoweth. I hope her ill-fated summer replacement sitcom on NBC doesn't turn people away from her amazing talent and theatrical pizazz, both of which are displayed on this album. Kristin has said that she identifies with '30's and '40's music and styles and that her voice seems to embellish those periods' styles of music. I agree, although, after listening to the CD, I wished she could have recorded one or two modern tracks to accompany the old-fashioned big-bandness...but purchase the album anyhow. You won't regret it...but you might regret watching her sitcom...yeesh...! Love."
4,I can see her in her voice!,"Once you have seen Kristen Chenoweth in action (check out YouTube) you know not only what an extremely talented musician she is, but also how fabulous she is at acting out and conveying each piece to an audience. She is the WHOLE package! This CD is a great sampling of her extreme talents!"
5,good stuff,"This is the same stuff the pros use when you go to the spa (I asked). It does leave a residue, so you'll have to shower after a massage, but it's worth it."
3,milo talon,i had read this book years ago it is the typical l'amour book good reading for the first time reader
4,I liked the book,I liked the book. I enjoyed Lucy's letters to Gram and Grampop. I wish they had written back. My favorite characters were Lucy and Snowshoe Ballou. Lucy loved to read and she was very funny in her imagination.
2,Mrs. Brown's 4th Grade Class,I gave The Ballard of Lucy Whipple 2 stars because it's boring. The story is full of many letters I didn't find intersting. I thought there were too many characters and that got confusing. I just don't like this book. I like books with more action and adventure.
5,"An exelent, realisic read","This a wonderfully realistic book about a girl with values, a girls we can all relate to some time or another. I like this book because, mainly, of the charectors and how real it seems. I'ts almost like you are there in the gold rush with Lucy, saving up gold in a pickle crock and trying to read Ivanhoe in between washing the dishes and making dinner for a tent full of dirty men trying to strike it rich. This is good book for anyone who likes realistic fiction, and a supurb heroine who wants to go back east."
5,CUSHMAN'S THIRD PAGE-TURNER,"Whenever someone asks me to recommend a good childrens' book, I always mention all three of Cushman's. (This one, Midwife's Apprentice, and Catherine, Called Birdy.) All three are written in diary form, with the main characters putting down their experiences and feelings. By the time you finish, you'll feel like the main character has become one of your best friends, and you'll be sad to say goodby."
4,News to Me,"Wonderful, gently written book about the history of the sea. Enjoyable to read and think about. Recommend for all ages."
4,all is well,"all is well, no problems.the children will enjoy the books as I did as a child.We grew up with Enid Blyton"
2,nice pictures but many errors,"This is the required reading for the hand lectures for our plastic surgery teaching conferences. This book has two very strong points: (1) the chapters are organized in a logical fashion and written in the same style making for an easy read(this book was written by a single author) and (2) all of the chapters have plenty of excellent figures to illustrate the concepts.That said, this book is chock-full of errors including formatting errors, grammatical errors, spelling errors, and factual errors. The formatting, grammatical, and spelling errors make it rather difficult to understand and annoying to read. The factual errors are very misleading and sometimes difficult for someone early in their training to weed out.All in all, this book has the potential to be a great hand text in its future editions, but I would not recommend the current edition."
4,just as advertised!,I was very happy with this program. It's easy to use and works well. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to move their old tapes and records to CD.
4,"A thorough, helpful tool for beginning speakers!","For four years I have used this book as the main textbook for a College course I teach in public speaking. It is thorough, covering all aspects of public speaking. It is written for the beginner in mind. Ample pictures, cartoons and quotes make it an enjoyable read. Students regularly tell me they appreciate how it doesn't seem like a textbook.I especially like the chapters on overcoming fear, making speeches more persuasive, improving your vocal and visual appeal, and speaking on special occasions (introducing someone, receiving an award, etc.). The title says it all - you will become more effective in public speaking if you apply the truths given in the book. However, it is my belief that you cannot learn to speak well from a book alone. It is an oral event that requires personal instruction alongside. What it teaches is good, and as a class resource it is excellent."
1,Pretty disappointed,"I've got to say that I am pretty disappointed in these. As most people who bought these I was looking to upgrade the sound quality of my ipod. But, these disappoint. I had previously bought Griffin Ear Jams that have a little plastic piece that goes over the ipod earphones earbud and you mount the little rubber pieces on them. For $15 I thought they worked well which is why I bought the Sennheiser which worked on the same principle.In short, the Sennheiser don't sound any better than the Griffins AND the Sennheiser doesn't come with a carrying case. This is a very bad omission because the rubber pieces fall off the earbud so easily. After having one fall off (but, luckily, I found it) I started putting them in a plastic baggy.I would definitely not recommend these Sennheiser, instead get the Griffins.Good luck,Bob"
2,Hit or miss,"Seems like this is literally hit or miss. I've owned three of the cx 300 previously and none lasted more than six month, but I always liked the sound and how comfortable they are. This one however, was busted in two days after the usage and I now know the difference clearly between cx 300 and 500. Good thing I ordered both at the same time! 500 is much more durable and has better sound quality. Go with 500."
4,"Great sound, but one annoyance","These phones sound great, no complaints with sound quality- however, I notice that with the in-canal design, everytime I would bump the cord I would ""hear"" it in my ears due to the vibration being transmitted through the cord. Otherwise, these are fantastic for the money- I changed to cans, but my wife loves her pair of CX300."
4,Nice buds for the price,"For the background, I've owned & used various IEM (In-Ear-Monitor) headphones over the years: Ety ER4p, Altec Lansing iM716, Shure E2c, Sony EX71, Koss KSC75. Here's my quick impression after using these headphones for a week:Pros:1. Very good bass & well balance (not as bloated as the Sony EX71, the ER4p has tight but the least bass-feel/effect.) Mid-range is good. Treble is just a little bit harsh right out of the box (but can be tamed with EQ.)2. Easy to drive (with the iM716 phones, I'd need to crank up the vol.)3. Very light weight4. Comfortable tips (3 sizes included)5. Decent isolation from outside noise (the ER4p &iM716; have better isolation)6. Moderately priced ($50)Cons:1. Cables are thin so handle with care.2. Some people may not like the ""phonendoscope effect"" (cables frictions.) This is very common with IEM headphones, some are more than others.3. No pouch or casePS: For bass-heads, you will like these IEMs - from an owner of Beyer DT770-80's experience :)"
4,Great earbuds!,"Bought these to use with my new iPod Touch. These earbuds are great! Had similar Sony in-ear earbuds but while these don't eliminate all the ambient noise, they do eliminate a lot of it. They fit nicely in the ear and are very comfortable. And the black color kind of matches the black look of the iPod Touch (if that's important to you). I also have the Shure noise cancellng ear phones/buds, but those are really uncomfortable and hard to put on. Of course, these earbuds are TONS better than those earbuds that come with all the iPods. Don't even try to use those. Spend a little money and get these. The price is very reasonable."
1,Bad quality cable,"I was a big fan of Sennheiser having owned and loved the HD-600 headphones for years.These, however, do not sound noticeably different than the stock iPod headphones and have one fatal flaw, the cord is a hard plastic and any physical contact with the cord transmits a sound straight to the ear. I am using them right now as I type this review. Just moving my head slightly creates a loud rustling sound in my ear.I am ordering a pair of Shure EC2s right now, maybe I'll have better luck with those.Bad."
3,"Great sound, not so great design","To begin, the sound on these headphones is definitely high quality. I could hear sounds and lyrics in songs that before were not very clear, which was great! I will not knock these headphones on sound quality in any way, and they fit great in my ears as well. However, I do have several qualms with these headphones.First, the cord is just poorly designed in my opinion. I did not realize it was the type with the shorter end (left ear is about 6 inches, right ear is about 2 feet), which REALLY annoys me. Secondly, the cord picks up sounds like you wouldn't believe - if it even grazes my shirt or touches an object I'm next to it creates an extremely loud noise. Don't even think about trying to run or be active with these headphones. Finally, the cord tangles worse than anything I've ever seen. Everytime I want to use them I spend 2-3 minutes just trying to untangle them. Besides that, though, good headphones."
4,Excellent sound,"This was my first I considered performance earbuds, they definitely lived up to their reputation. The sound quality was excellent. I hated the ""brushing"" noise, I noticed after the split point from the wire, the right side didn't have this problem, but it still remained on the left side. I am not a big fan of the asymmetrice design of the wire but I will just have to get used to it. Aside from these two points I love them and I strongly recommend them."
3,Sennheiser earbuds review,The earbuds sound very good. They have different length cords to the buds wthich is not a good idea. The longer cord tends to get in the way and be somewhat cumbersome. The fit is good the sound is very good though.
3,You can do better...,"I bought these the same time my girlfriend bought her Bose in-ear headphones. She paid $40 more for hers. What a sucker! I'm talking about me, not her. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra $40.The mids and highs are pretty nice, but the CX300's do not offer a good bass sound.Just remember, you get what you pay for."
1,Absolute rubbish,"These are the most horrible in-ear headphones I've ever tried. No bass frequency at all and very uncomfortable. Shame on Sennheiser. It's unbelievable that they can cost 30 ?. The MX 500 are much better by far.And now, who refunds my money?."
3,Acceptable,"I purchased these for use with an Apple Shuffle that I carry when flying. The Apple earphones are ridiculous. You feel like you must shove them in to your ear canal, and they always feel like they are going to fall out. The Sennheiser fits like an earplug and they do a good job of blocking ambient noise on an airliner. This means lower volume levels to listen to music. The unequal length earbud cords were not something I was aware of when I made my purchase. I will never buy another set of earbuds with the unequal length cords. That is a really Stupid Idea. The sound is OK, nothing spectacular, but considering the size of the units I guess it's all I can hope for."
4,Impressived on the quality at this price,"Besides the asymmetric of the cord, I can't pick out any negatives.Really hate this one side longer the other side shorter design.It took me a while to get used to the feeling when it's in my ears.I use it for my DIY 300B, 45, 71A, and 2A3 tube amps. It really gives excellent performance on each amp. You can tell right away which tube amp you are listening. That is, this is a great amp ""monitor"". 112db sensitivity, you are hearing more sounds from this bud---detailed sound.It's a bit too much bass for me."
1,terrible fit,"I had to return these (very easy -- thanks, Amazon!) because they were just terrible. They did not fit my ears at all; they wouldn't stay in for even a few seconds. I tried all of the different sizes, and none of them worked. I would not recommend these earbuds at all."
2,Horrible Design,"First off, the sound quality of these earbuds is indeed pretty good. However, the cord design totally offsets that value. From reading other reviews, it appears as though the right earbud cord is longer than the left so you can drape it behind your neck? I can't find anything on Sennheiser's site about it. But I'm not sure how this is supposed to be a good thing. It's very awkward. The cord material is very rubbery so there is a lot of friction and grab. If the cord is draped on my bare neck and I turn my head to the right, the rubber cord pulls against my neck and pulls the earbud out of my right ear.Just because of that alone, I'll probably stop using these. They're just a pain to use and are very awkward due to the different cord length."
4,Very good sound!,"These headphones have a nice, rich sound with great bass. They seem to be manufactured of a high quality as well. I purchased them after my original earbuds had gone out. And, while they do sound great when you're lounging around, I don't recommend them for jogging. Because of the in-ear style, I heard every fall of the cord between steps as a thump in my ear. So, unless you're going to use them while exercising, they're definitely worth the money!"
2,LoFi ear buds,"I own a pair of HD-595 and purchased a pair of HD-497 as a gift for my brother. They are excillent for the prices. I did not hesitate to place the order after briefly reading the reviews. Well, disapointed.Too much highs, bass has no depth. Try removing the rubber cover, they sound cheaply. The worst thing is the mids, badly distorted. Changing the rubber cover may help a little bit with the bass, depending on your ears but mids can not be corrected.I was afraid of the fake products, so I purchased them directly from Amazon. I trusted Senn so much that I just tossed away the box and all the papers. Now I'm just wondering if I can return these."
5,Audio Engineering Excellence,"I recently listened to music with these for 5 hours straight and got to know them well. These babies are awesome. The highs are bright, the mid-range is excellent and the low-end/bass is very good. I'm amazed they can produce sound of this quality in such a small device. Bose and Klipsch have nothing on these things. And it bares repeating, the bass is VERY GOOD - almost THX quality. Taking further into account the price of these things and we're talking BEST BUY."
2,"Average, but mine are broken now","I've had my earbuds for about 3 months and I was really never impressed. Maybe I expected too much from some $50 earbuds, but after reading all the user reviews I thought I was going to get a great set of earbuds. The sound always sounded ""stuffy"" and not very clear; really didn't seem to matter what I did to the EQ. The fit on these is OK, I could really never get them to get a nice fit no matter what size fitting I used. The worst part is that my left earbud has no sound now at all and this is after very infrequent gentle use for 3 months. UPDATED... Sennheiser does have quick and friendly repair service and they let me get a different (more expensive) pair of headphones and no cost"
5,Mega Kudos for Fantastic Food,"Marlene Koch did the impossible. Provided healthy recipes for everyday people using everyday ingredients. Some cookbooks with complicated ingredients and recipes just frustrated me, but Fantastic Food has me enjoying cooking again. The Asian Barbecued Pork Tenderloin is great; Spicy Orange Beef was a hit with everyone in the family and the Zesty Chicken Strips with Sweet Mustard Dip is the best in the world. The Sweet Balsamic Vinaigrette is absolutely tops. It's almost hard to believe you're cooking healthy when everything tastes so great. I have made several other recipes and intend to make everything in this book. It is truly terrific!!!"
2,Blah Blah Blah,"This mythological book was about a prince that was very full of himself and it gets him in trouble. He is sent on missions by the empress of another land. First he his sent on a mission and if he succeeds he will be awarded a bronze ax, then a silver if he succeeds at the next mission. However, the price will not be satisfies until he gets the golden ax. He eventually is the cause of his land's ruin and is doomed for the rest of his life.This book was way too wordy for elementary school children. They would become bored with it quickly and miss the meaning. The illustrations were wonderful but still not enough to make up for the abundance of words on every page. The author's message was that you should be happy with what you have and not be so full of yourself as to cause others harm."
3,"good, but not as good as the prenatal video","This video is good, but not as good as the prenatal video. I'm not crazy about how it's broken up into 3 sections. It was good early on when my baby was very little. He's 4 1/2 mo. now and I find myself more interested in doing cardio when I can find the time."
2,Don't be fooled... you can't do this dvd with your baby.,"I feel quite mislead. The picture on the cover as well as ""snapshots"" shown before each section suggest that this dvd will allow you to engage with your new baby while doing yoga together. Yeah, right. Actually, you are doing yoga while your baby ""sleeps, or plays, near you."" I hoped to at least find suggestions of how to incorporate baby into the work but there was no such information included with the dvd. I wish I had gotten a different yoga DVD. I will admit, the yoga in it is ok... I think I would enjoy it, if I could include my little girl, but as it stands it's too basic for me to rationalize doing this dvd over others since either way I'm not spending time with my baby. Too bad, so sad...10 Minute Solution: Prenatal Pilates"
4,Hits the Mark for the average small to meduim Landlord,"Helps explain what the CPA was jabbering on about and puts things into clear perspective. When it starts to get confusing, the book refers you to other more in-depth publications. Highly recommended."
4,Useful information but be careful,"I chose this book because my husband and I have rental property and that my husband is a tax consultant.He was hoping it would be a good reference point for both of our business ventures.His bottom line is that while this book would be helpful for those with rental property it does not replace a good tax consultant.There were points in this book that he did not agree with fully.Others that he felt were true but still needed deeper interpretationAnd a few he found enlightening.Overall, a good reference book but just a part of what someone will need to address the tax issues involved with income property."
1,Piece of junk that did not work and we had to send me under the warranty!!,"Product was DOA!!!!!! Had to return to RCA for them to honor their warrant!!!! Warranty was honored and a working item was sent for the products replacement. Also, the product that was DOA was not packaged correctly."
1,Definately not as advertised!,"It doesn't work! The package that I received has, what looks like, two base units (two phone jacks in each unit). Thinking that it might still work that way, I've tried it, and it doesn't work."
1,Did not work,The extension unit did not work. The base unit green light came on when I hooked it to the phone line and it was working. However the extension unit would not light up in any of the outlets. Amazon took the product back so at least I got my money back.
1,Grab a wire hanger,"So, got this in the mail and both units were not paired. Easy enough. Fixed. Next can be summed up in ""If I hold a wire hanger in my hand on one foot, could I get these units to sync after being paired"". Answer would be....no.The units are 10 feet apart through a fairly normal wall and in numerous loactions would not sync.To add to this, I have a fair amount of feedback on the line in the way of a hum. It's interference that I cannot fix. See: Wire Hanger.These are worthless"
3,Nice Book,"This is a nice book to have for the more experienced cactus and succulent growers. I do have to say this book has very colorful pictures of cactus and succulents, however, the specific growing needs for each species is rather short and limited. A beginner to this hobby may experience some difficulties with providing the specific growing conditions with this book for each species. I would certainly consider purchasing this book as a gift for the upcoming holidays, as it would make a nice gift."
4,Good Introduction,"I always thought cactus were kinda cool, and look great, so I thought i would pick up a book to learn more about them. This book was my first on the subject, and is an ok introduction but even for a beginner like me left more to be desired. It does have a nice glossy feel with plenty of color photos, but doesn't cover a lot of material. Its not a bad choice to start out, but there is probably a better choice.The book covers grafting, a few different types with a photo or two of each, and a couple of points of contact for clubs and more information."
4,Good Buy,"This is a good book. It has al lot of basic information (life of plant, care, ect). I bought this book mainly for the succulent information. I was hoping there would be more info on different species though. Over all I think it's a good book for a novice, which I am. I'm stilling looking for more information on specific species of succulents but this book gives a nice summary general summary for succulents."
5,Improved daughter's fine motor skills within a week,"I know it sounds crazy, but my 3 year old daughter went from scribbling indecipherable pictures to creating defined shapes and drawing actual objects after using this cutting book for a few days in a row last week. I do believe this book and of course, the time my husband spent working with her, have improved her fine motor skills quite noticeably. She also loves it and is now using scissors to cut out pictures for other projects. I highly recommend this book!"
4,Lovely Dress,"This dress is soft and very comfortable. It is just low-cut enough, that you may like a cami underneath. The seam just below the bust began to come out after only two washes (on gentle). But, it is still my favorite summer dress!"
4,Fitting Compilation,"Having been familiar with artists like Cirrus, Propellerheads, Crystal Method, and Lunatic Calm, I decided to further test the waters of electronica. I purchased a few compilations, and this happened to be one of them. All in all, it was a wonderful purchase. Digital Empires: The Aftermath offers a great selection of artists and unique styles of electronica. The beats are fantastic and will really keep you moving. Again, great compilation."
4,bto's best album,"following the success of the 1973's ""II"", bto put out ""not fragile"" in early 1974. the album marked a slight change in direction as the band's already heavy sound turned more directly toward metal here. it also marked the debut of blair thornton as a second lead guitar, something that would eventually cause one of many rifts within the band over the next couple of years. randy bachman didn't like competition! this album rocks from start to finish with the powerful title track leading to the driving road song ""roll on down the highway"" and then moving on to the band's only no.1 hit, ""you ain't seen nothin' yet,"" featuring randy's stutter vocals. there are some oddball elements as well: a duane allman tribute (the instrumental ""freewheelin'"") and a song featuring a pedal steel guitar (""blue morning""). the album closes with a great power boogie ""givin' it all away."" all in all, it's a lot of fun and a good example of better than average 70s hard rock."
3,Not Fragile,Not like I remember . . slight disappointment upon hearing again. For BTO enthusiasts only.
4,Pretty good,I had read several different reviews so I was apprehensive about reading this book. Once I started it I could not put it down until I reached the end.I have to agree with one of the reviewers when they said that she had to many story lines going. In my opinion it was like she just threw that part of the story in for no reason. I would have loved to see the book deal with the lives of Sean and Lisa. It had been so long since I had read WIRI I forgot some of the characters. This book is nothing compared to Ms. Shapodee's other work. I am hoping that in her next book she will pick up where this book left off and fill some of the answered questions that are out there.Overall I gave this book 4 stars because I felt that the book was good and it had a great story line. This book was a quick read.
5,musical genius,I can only be in awe of his pianistic skills. The man is a genius. There is no difficulty in viewing this performance over and over again.
3,A Readable Term Paper,"I've read (and loved) everything Mary Gordon has written. And I like biographies of historical figures, so I figured this book was a sure-fire winner. But as Joan herself would have said, non.It's not a bad book. I learned a lot, and was surprised by a few things (for example, Joan's successful military career spanned only 5 months). But the writing is uninspired, a recitation of facts with only a little meat on the bones to make it interesting. It read like an over-long term paper.Overall this book was interesting enough to make me want to read a *real* biography of Joan of Arc. But it also made me swear off any more non-fiction by Mary Gordon, or perhaps any of the other books in the Penguin Lives series."
2,Bedtime story,"Gordon is a devout Catholic and a skilled storyteller who ducks the criticisms of history snobs by describing this modest work as a meditation, rather than a biography. The book is an account of the lives and legends of a medieval teenager, who either did or did not hear heavenly voices, and who was either a brilliantly intuitive military leader or else a glorified flag girl.Gordon's credulous tone is aggravated in the audio version by Mari Devon's breathy interpretation. Devon treats the listeners like small children, giving her high-pitched voice feigned expressions of amusement, awe, and despair. 'After THAT, JO-oan was known as the MA-AI-AI-D of Or-lay-OHHHHNZ.'"
4,Absolutly Brilliant!!!,"I have to admit that I was slightly skeptical about the newest ""British Supergroup"" (only Kiam Gallegher is missing to complete an emaculate lineup)- the hype surrounding the lauch has so often in the past been such a disappointed BUT the CD exceeded my wildest expectations. Listen to it completly before disecting each song - you can actually see the ""story"" unfolding. Definatly ranks high on the best of the last 12 months.....NOT Radiohead yet but could reach similar status should they show consistency and mange to harmonize diverse talents featured even futher. GO ORDER NOW !"
2,Unapologetically boring,"Sorry, but this one is just boring!!! Snooze alert! I will keep it next to my bed and listen to it while I sleep! After repeated listens it simply is missing the 'stuff' that made Blur and The Verve so great. Hey, it doesn't have to be 'in your face' noisy or loud, I would prefer mellow but make sure it has a pulse! As a note, Blur has always been one of my favorite, most promising bands to come out of the UK. Gorillaz continued with this that energy. I can say the same with The Verve and The Clash, so what happened here? People who rate this a buy (Alternative Press, etc.) are doing so simply to sell the record. This will in be the $5 bin in no time."
2,Snooze away,"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ, oh, sorry I fell asleep there for a bit....Must have been trying to listen to the Good, the Bad and the Queen again......Actually the title track seemed to have some energy, but concidering the rest of the cd is lacking in any, it came as a welcome suprise.....Some review made reference to Blur's Modern Life is Rubbish...The only thing similar to that wonderful recording, is Damon's participation and the last word in the title."
4,Damon Albarn is a genius!,I love Damon Albarn and basically will purchase anything that he has done. He is one of the best musicians out there and this new band of his doesn't fall short of expectations. This CD is refreshing and rocks!!
5,Very Enjoyable,"I greatly enjoyed this tale and have read it at least four or five times over the last 30 years. I supposed with movie version of The Hobbit approaching, I'll soon be rereading all Tolkein's books."
3,Farmer Giles of Ham,"This is a readable, witty and amusing tale, but it cannot be compared to 'The Hobbit' or 'Lord of the Rings'. 'Farmer Giles of Ham' is a children's fairytale, wheras 'The Hobbit' and 'Lord of the Rings' are entirely suitable for adults."
2,How much do clothes cost in the Matrix?,Hello Amazon shopper. I am talking directly to you. You must decide if you are ready to learn about the Matrix. As a sign of your determination you will purchase this coat and change your name to Morpheus.
1,"Remote Viewing What It Is, Who Uses It and How To Do It",Rifat is so blinded by conspiracy theories that it makes his book laughable. Buy another book on Remote Viewing.
2,Everyday Meals for Whom?,"Perhaps, I was thinking wrongly, but when I think of everyday meals, I don't think of the recipes that are included in this book. I was looking forward to recipes that helped me fix many of things I already fix in a healthier way. Instead, I consider most of the recipes in this book to be fancy (things I might use for special occasions). Though I'm sure the recipes are wonderful (I haven't tried any yet), this is just not what I was expecting from the title."
4,I got that funky feeling,I got that funky feeling I feel it all around I got that funky feeling Do you hear that TECK---NO sound?Boom shackalacka
5,Genesis Genius,"I was listening to this album again tonight and was struck by two things. 1. Phil Collins has never really been given credit for his musical brilliance as displayed in this work with Genesis, and 2. there are times when you need to turn off the ""shuffle"" feature on the iPod and listen to an album straight through.This work reminds me of opera. It builds and slows emotionally, using the instrumental portions to create anticipation for the poignant lyrics which follow. A deep range of emotions play out; love revealed as complicated. And, remember, this is live and Phil pulls it all off while literally setting the rhythm of the show as the drummer.Brilliant, beautiful. Perfect for anyone with a heart for romance and an ear for how music can express such things."
5,Pink Colored Vinyl LP has just 15 tracks,"The pink-colored vinyl LP has just 15 tracks: Side One: 1. Banzai Pipeline - Boardwalkers; 2. Baby Elephant Walk - The Jigsaw Seen; 3. Peter Gunn - Poison Ivy of the Cramps; 4. Monkey Farm - Tiki Tones; 5. Charade [Instrumental] - The Blue Hawaiians; 6. Lonesome - Friends of Dean Martinez ; 7. Arabesque - The Huntington Cads; 8. Push the Button, Max! - Del Noah & The Mt. Ararat Finks; Side Two: 1. Shot in the Dark - Wiskey Biscuit; 2. Touch of Evil - Man or Astro-man?; 3. Mr. Yunioshi - Insect Surfers; 4. Experiment in Terror - Davie Allan & The Arrows; 5. Mr. Lucky - Elliot Easton's Tiki Gods; 6. Pink Panther Theme - Oranj Symphonette; 7. Moon River - Nan Vernon"
3,Good Sound for Price,"This headphone has good sound, high clarity, decent bass. Headphone is a little tight if you have a small head but very tight for larger heads, comfortability is average. Swivel feature is OK if you need to pause to talk without removing the headphones"
5,BASE,i love the headphones they are great at first they are kind tight around the head but trust me after a few days of breaking them in and a lil bit patience they are bananaz.I would def recommend them to a friend they are not expensive but the sound quality behind them is GREAT. one thing i hate about them is that the cable is extreme long like long but nothing that will hinder you from using them.
2,Very bad bass!!,"I'm really disappointed of this product. I cannot find any ""super bass"" they said. The bass is much much less than their even low-priced earbuds such as mx560... Actually the bass is almost non-existent.Considering the high pitch is clear and crispy, I decided not to give it a 1 star comment but 2."
2,Without having listened to them...,"... I just opened the package and tried them on. They make my head feel like a giant zit that is going to pop. Seriously. The pressure is too much and I hope it relaxes a bit.Edit: A month or so down the road of daily use, they have indeed relaxed and are now comfortable."
2,the comfort is lacking,"The sound is great, but they are tight. I stretched them out on a couch arm overnight, It just reverted to the original discomfort. I dont have huge ears, they dont cover your ear you have to like stick them in and that brings even more discomfort. When i spend more for headphones i expect 2 things comfort and quality sound."
3,Bass Overload,"These headphones emphasize the ""DJ"" part of the model name -- put these on and you'll feel like you're in a dance club. Too much emphasis on bass for me, but if that's you're thing then these are the cans for you. I use it with an i-Pod and found the sound quality vastly improves if I select ""bass reducer"" on the i-Pod's equalizer menu when using these headphones. Overall: good construction and comfortable, but not as balanced a sound as I'd like."
3,These Are Not the Cans You Are Looking For,"I keep these over the top of my Dell tower (at work) when I'm not wearing them. It keeps them stretched out enough that they don't give me a headache when I wear them. On the positive side, these things will NOT fall off your head unless you are preforming the most extreme stunts. Like wow.I wear glasses, and they mash my ear up against the arm of my glasses up against my skull. It's really awful.The sound quality is fine, but I got them for their purported bass response, and I'm disappointed. The clarity is very good, but the range is just really limited. Even when I'm NOT trying to pound my brains out with bass, they disappoint.Honestly, they don't sound better than regular iPod ear buds. They certainly don't feel better, either.I can definitely say they LOOK better. They look pretty cool, actually. So if that's your priority, grab them now. Otherwise... move along."
4,E-z solution if tips over in wind,"If your greenhouse tips over in high winds, put a black solar bag of water on the bottom rack-the weight will keep from tipping over in high winds. In the day the water heats up and helps keep the inside warm at night. Hey, pretty good for a girl!"
4,Good Earth Lighting,"My husband and I were pleased with the length of this item as we needed it for the pathway in the back of the house, so far it has been very useful for people coming into our rec room at night."
4,Very Nice,"I bought this not knowing how it would work, but I am glad I did. They look great! I installed them on my balcony and ran it along my roof and at nights it is a knockout. My only letdown if any is that the lights are not bright white but of a yellow hue."
1,Worked for about an hour,Section of the lights went out within an hour of putting the lights up. iti s a lot of work to get these lights up and very frustrating that the quality was so poor they didn't even make it through one night.
3,Not bad for used.,"I boght a used 48' rope light because of the not so good reviews, don't have time to reship sometimes, they where cheap ,I would'nt loose to much. Anyways I got them, plugged them-up, about 2' of lighting did'nt work. I still use them and put on my outside deck. The section of the lights that did'nt work, I wrapped them around one of the deck post until the lites looked like they all worked, and connected all together. That's one good way to hide the bad section if you don't get a good ropelight from the start. don't know how long they will last had them on every nite for a month so far. Other than that, the deck looks great. I get complaiments all the time."
1,ONLY LASTED A YEAR,"My rope lights only last a year...The product description says.....""The lights themselves are extremely long-lasting--they're rated at 35,000 hours"". My lights are on a timer for 8 hours a day for 365 days or + - 3,000 hours of use, these didn't even come close. I am going to try to get a free replacement but my guess is I'll get turned down or it will cost more to ship the lights back then what they originally cost...."
4,Great lights!,"I agree with those who say the mounting clips included are bad. This is not a problem for the first year. After that if installed where exposed to the elements, they tend to become brittle and will break which then creates a domino effect, where your lighting will cascade to the ground clip by failing clip. Do yourself a favor and don't bother with the included mounting hardware. Go to Lowe's, in the cable/electrical section look for 7/16 Plastic Cable staples made by ""Ideal"". They can be installed with a small hammer. The lights themselves lasted approximately five years of nightly use. They are NOT L.E.D but then again they DO give off a soft amber-ish light which is perfect if you don't want the garish white L.E.D.'s put out."
2,Damn...,The rope lights were missing a good chunk of working lights in the middle of the rope! I still hung them up but it kind of sucks.
1,Modern Day Snake Oil,"If you read this book you will be led to believe that Oil of Oregano (only the type Dr. Ingram sells and no other) will cure anything from foot fungus to Hepatitis B. However, you have to keep taking it forever (even after the disease is ""cured""), you have to take capsules and oil under the tongue several times a day and you have to keep sending Dr. Ingram several hundred dollars a month for the products. What if it doesn't work? Then take more and more. What if your own doctor says it's worthless? Then he's part of the medical industry conspiracy trying to keep you away from Oil or Oregano. Dr. Ingram presents no scientific data to speak of to support his claims, only anecdotical stories about miracle cures and sewage sterilization. He walks a fine line between making unsubstantiated claims and spinning a nice story. Save your money. This is nothing more than the script for a late night informational."
5,Natural cure,"I saw the author on a local news program. Ordered the book on Amazon. Good book, lots of good info. Safe natural cures."
4,Review #1,"The video is pretty informative. It moves through the information pretty fast and, if you are going to take notes on it, you might need to pause it at times. Other than that, the movie takes you through the history of WWII through the eyes of Hitler's adversaries. The picture quality is decent. The plot is easy to follow. Buy it if you like history."
5,beautiful,The pictures of the dogs were beautiful. The set-up is fine. You can enter a much information as you want.Very nice gift for a new puppy owner!
3,Good for inbetween,"I use this product on the crown of my head for inbetween colorings. It does a great job but doesn't last very long however---two to three washings at the most. Also, this product is discontinued by Clairol. You can only find it very occasionally online. I bought this product much cheaper than it's selling for now. With shipping included, I would not pay the current price for this product..not worth it."
1,this aint got no swing,"HORRIBLE!!!They do NOT do swing anywhere on this wretchid turd of an album. It is a way lame Marylin Manson sound alike, with sound effects, grungs guitars, bad vocals, incomprehensible lyrics. Gone are the horns and big band swing sound. I pad a dollar and I want my money back. It is that BAD!!!"
1,Just a compilation of existing books,"The three stories are excellent in themselves, however, I had already read them. What I really want is some new stories from ""the greatest writer since Robert E. Howard to tell the stories of Conan the Barbarian."" I am starving for them."
2,"looks great, less filling","looks great until it gets a few scratches.then it is totally unusable in daylight, in the car or outI'm replacing mine before I get into a accident. too many closecalls, while holding it down below the dash board to be able to read it."
1,Do NOT buy this game,"I'm on dialup, and the game said it can be played on dialup. Well it can't. After 50 straight hours spent downloading the patches, I finally got to start the game. It was as boring as boring can be. Plus, at dialup speed, just forget it. I complained to Sony and they were ""gracious"" enough to refund my monthly subscription money. But I'm still out the $20 I paid at Walmart.I'd give this game negative stars if that was an option. No use rehashing what the others have said. The missions are pointless, unrealistic, take forever to complete, and grant you very small rewards.This game is a complete STRIKE OUT."
5,Helps to See the Small Things,"These Loupes (loops)...however you care to spell them are a wonderful addition to any household...for times when you need to see the small things. I am a coins dealer and they make my need to grade coins, along with viewing very small things that my eyes alone cannot see, a much more enjoyable experience."
3,Alright product,"I haven't used much, I stick with my lighted jeweler's loupe. You get what you pay for, and these didn't cost much"
5,Great Book! Used for math class.,This is a terrific book! The 3rd grade math teacher at our private school uses this book in her class. Well worth the money.
3,Mono meets tony,"There's a reason this is a dual-credited disc. It clearly becomes the epic, though sometimes generic, post-rock group's toolbox to experiment with more long-winded classical influence, but what it ends up sounding like compositionally, is unsure minimalist indulgences with a side order of typically bold but not completely necessary scorchers."
3,The Doors Concerto Riders on the Storm,I purchased the recording mainly for one song I liked when I heard it on my radio station. I don't care much for the rest of the music. The CD is in excellent playing condition.
2,Turning solid music into mush,"I'd never purchased a Nigel Kennedy album before. After my experience with this one, I never will again. Kennedy has managed to transform some of the best rock music ever written into Muzak mush."
2,Surprising Disappointment,"Being both a Beegie Adair and a Cole Porter fan I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of this CD, but would have to say it is, to my taste, the weakest of her works. I've tried to think why, and believe it is a conflict between a great instrumentalist and a great lyricist, indeed poet. Porter's genius was in his poetry, set to catchy tunes.In this CD, Beegie seems to run rampant with the music to the point that one can't follow the lyrics, either in your head or aloud. It seems a bit egotistical to me to do so, and I would compare this CD with her wonderful ""I'll Take Romance,: where Beegie seems to worship the songs she plays. In ""Dream Dancing,"" it's more of a battle.The final track ""Begin the Beguine"" is just painful, a slow funeral dirge of a song that can be a great self proclamation.Not recommended."
5,Swinging Trio Feeling,"This is a great new addition to the Beegie Adair collection of CD releases. You will find that this CD has a swinging trio feeling and is beautifully designed to sustain an air of strong rhythm and improvisation throughout. If you are looking for a lyrical jazz CD that you can listen to over a great dinner with special guests, or a jazz CD that will put you in a great frame of mind while driving to the office, this is the one. Beegie Adair has an intimate feeling for the work of Cole Porter to whom she pays special tribute on this release. Enjoy."
1,"Good idea, not worth the price","The ""stirrer"" widget that spins at the bottom becomes stuck with dried cocoa after about two uses, no matter how hard you try to clean it (some must seep along the axle).Once this happens, the cocoa won't stir, and simply burns. Great!"
4,worth it for just one song...,"""Stay With Me"" is one of the best unrequited love songs I've ever heard, especially in the punk/hard rock genre. It's very simple, but the imagery and emotions expressed are right on the money. It's not schmaltzy - it's Dictators-style honesty. The guy get dumped by the girl, mopes around, cries, etc -- but also gets drunk, high, acts like a fool and starts fights. I might not do all that, but some guys would...I think The Dictators would. And that's just the lyrics! Musically it's catchy as hell with an anthemic bridge and chorus. I guess you might call it pop-punk. If you do put it in that genre, it absolutely blows away every current practioner of that style. Period."
5,best sneakers,"these are the best! comfortable, pretty, long lasting. My daughter has worn them out. She has gotten many compliments over 6 months every time she wears them."
5,"Beautiful music, beautiful cover","All I have to say is, this album rocks the casbah baby! I love every single track and listen to it on the way to and from work every day. The classic instruments fused together with the modern instruments make such a great marriage, its hard to just sit and Listen quietly instead of dancing! Listening to this actually gave me a greater appreciation for Hossam's music. I have quite a few of Hossam's albums, but this one tops the chart. It also has the songs used for warm up in my class which was a really nice bonus. I think some of the songs might be used for peformance for an intermede/advanced student. Heck, even if I didnt dance, and just liked middle eastern music, Id definatly buy Immortal Egypt."
1,CD,"I love the music, but my CD came scratched. I was not very happy about that. I only got to listen to it once!!!!"
4,A good book for a rainy Sunday,"The relationships that grow before your eyes will grab you and keep you until you reach the end. The story is centered around a priest and her congregation in a small mountain town. I think what drew me into the book, more than anything else, was the author's ability to a priest as a ""normal"" person. I guess I don't normally put a priest, minister, etc. on the same level as everyone else. I am definately going to read more books by Gail Godwin. They are great!"
1,"Cheap, cheap, cheap!","The packaging is really flimsy and the materials are cheap and fragile. Note, also, that it does NOT contain a watch case opener. The kit does not contain instructions, either.Perhaps the price compared to other items is a giveaway but, really, it's even worse than the price suggests."
4,good set,"I was thankful to receive this tool set. I was struggling to size several watches with various makeshift items before. Once I opened this set and used it for the first time, it relieved me of all the aggravation I previously had of trying/attempting to size my watches. The only reason for four stars instead of five is that the quality is not the best. I had slightly warped one of the pin tools. Regardless, for the price and saving of aggravation, it has paid for itself."
4,Watch Band kit worth every penny!,"The kit is terrific! I was able to use everything immediately to re-size and replace the batteries in 6 watches in less than an hour. I would recommend that you go to the website listed in the kit for instructions on resizing and battery replacement. They were extremely useful. I was paying a watch repair shop $10.95 +tax to fix each watch. This kit was $29.95+SH. Those 6 watches would have cost me nearly $70 to repair, absolutely worth the cost. My only regret is not buying it sooner. It would have saved me a lot of frustration and money. Now, I fix watches for my daughters and friends as well."
1,Useless,Wasted my money. There were no instructions on its use. Without directions it was worthless. I should have returned it.
2,Less expensive options out there,Paid a little extra to purchase this kit thinking the tools would be higher quality but was disappointed. Ended up returning the kit and buying one for $20 that had more tools or similar quality maybe even better.
1,Worst Book Ever,"This book is so bad. The author, Michael Schudson, doesn't realize that books are around longer than human beings live and some people around the age of 16 at present day don't know what watergate was about. He should've explained what it was in the beginning of the book. I had to ask my dad about it because I couldn't understand what the author was talking about without background knowledge about watergate. I'd take the Scarlet Letter over this book anyday (and believe me the scarlet letter was pretty bad itself)."
4,There are more pennies out there!,"This book does provide a good analysis for the ambitious profit seeker in the small market, but I would also consider Dan Holtzclaw's ""Penny Stocks: The Next American Gold Rush.""-Dan provides great links and his market strategy is great as well!"
3,sales pitch,The book is ok but I felt like the entire thing was a sales pitch for a news letter that author sends out. The author explains how he gets his ratings. It sounds like the system could work but if you are a go getter and you are trying to devise your own plan for investing rather than doing what someone else is telling you to do then this book probably isn't for you. If you want to invest but you dont feel you have the time to do your own research then get the book. The plan could probably help you out.
5,aloha from hawaii..blue buffalo rocks!!,ALOHA FROM MAUI...i have 3 dogs..2 are senior dogs..one is 16+ years and the other is 13+ years old..my third is younger and also feed her Blue Buffalo.

Mahalo
3,Thought it would be good,1) Shelton Benjamin vs Chris Jericho= stellar match lots of action. ****My vote was Rhyno2) Diva battle royal= good action from these women. good match ****My vote was school girl3) kane vs Gene Snitsky= slow paced but still not too bad. ***My vote was lead pipe4)Eugene vs Eric Bishoff= crap. lasted 2 minutes long. *my vote was loser gets there head shaved5) Christy vs Carmella= took 15 minutes to change and the match lasted 54 seconds. 0 starsmy vote was lingera pillow fight6) Edge & Benoit vs la resistance= very good match. i loved it. *****7) HBK vs Triple h= shawn was crippled. utter crap. **My vote was Edge8) Ric Flair vs Randy orton. worst cage match ever. **My vote was falls count anywherethis was not a good ppv and would not recommend it unless you collect dvd's like me
3,Decent PPV,"1)Shelton Benjamen vs Y2JIC Title8/10 Good match! Shelton Benjamen wins with an Exploder Suplex.2)Diva Battle Royal3/10 Not a real wrestling match, just for teens with crazy hormones. Trish wins it.3)Kane vs Gene SnitskyChain Match10/10 Great match! Tons of blood and guts.

Orton wins a great,bloody match with an RKO.Overall PPV:8/10"
2,WHAT IF BARRY MANILOW SANG TOM WAITS?,"Okay, Tom is one of those artists who's music transfers well to almost anyone's interpretation. They are just damn good songs, and it's hard to mess up a good song. But listening to this music is like hearing Tom Waits emasculated, or maybe a Stepford Tom Waits. Hammond's voice and delivery doesn't even approach the pathos or spirit of Tom's. Sure it has a nice ""Blues groove"", but the spirit of Waits is lost in this recording. If Tom's music is smoked brandy,this music is a blended daiquiri with a paper umbrella. Holly Cole, who is, sometimes, so upbeat I want to slap her, gives a much more sensitive, gritty, and moving performance of Waits' songs than this Julie-Andrews-Guy. If you want mediocrity, buy this cd. If you want artistry, pass it by."
4,Awesome product,this is my 3rd watch i purchase i bought on amazon this is value for money and very good shipping which is amazing..
2,Disappointing,"I have been waiting for this book for a while as the publishing date slipped a few times. Having recieved the book, I wish I never bought it. To start with 2/3 of the book is about java, optimisation, a poor section on JDBC and some networking stuff that you can find anywhere else. The remaining of the book is a general discussion of Java and the last chapter (Ch 15) is about a simple 3d engine (jist 3D)which is pretty incomplete. The book has many incomplete code snippets and no games in sight which is surprising when the authors have been around the game development forums for such a long time.The book seems to be a poor attempt in discussing games development in Java. More like an attempt to cash in the market demand.If you are buying this book to learn about Java and 3D, then there are better books such as -Developing Games in Java- by Brackeen which has good explanations about various aspect of game development in java.My advice is that dont waste your money on this book!"
5,Surprisingly good...,"I just purchased and finished this book recently. Not normally a genre I read but I happened across it while perusing Amazon books.I really enjoyed the book. Interesting characters, solid combat sequences and an interesting twist on powers.Definitely recommended. I would compare it more to the TV series Hero's than to comics in general.Hopefully there will be more books in the series."
3,Good Wartime Movie,"Most war movies actually made during WW2, are a bit too soppy and unrealistic for my liking, but this movie was quite good and it portrayed a major event during WW2 in the Pacific. Spencer Tracy did a good job, as Jimmy Doolittle and Van Johnson wasn't bad either. I don't know how Van Johnson's wife in the movie, got pregant when they where sleeping in seperate bed's, unless he had a really long d***?? I liked the fact that the aircraft, ships etc in the movie looked authentic. There is nothing worse in a war movie then seeing a Mustang or Trainer painted up to look like ME-109. Having said that, the Trainers made up to look like Zero's in ""Tora Tora Tora"" looked the part. Overall a good war movie, well worth the money."
4,Mix of Rock & Jazz,"This is my only Weider CD and I would recommend it, like the title of my review says it is a mixture of Jazz & Rock. It has a nice flow to it and before you know it, you're done listening. I don't think with repeated play that this is the type of CD that you ever get sick of hearing."
3,Had Problem With Fastener Backing Out,"On the front lower control arm aft attaching fastener, I had problems with the fastener backing out twice. The first time I was afraid I had not torqued it to spec which would have been my fault. The second time I know it was torqued and it is a function of the motion of the bushing against the washer and fastener. I re-torqued it again with red locktite and it has stayed torqued for about 5K miles now.This is a little disconcerting. Maybe these bushings are not really appropriate if they are not captured on both sides by stationary structure."
2,Unimpressive Debut,"Tank is not a great singer. He's a fairly decent vocalist. The material presented here on his debut disc is, in it's best moments, run-of-the-mill. The only reason to buy this CD is for the artwork. The photos of him are amazing and worth the price alone. Otherwise, this is a very poor debut from the somewhat impressive rising star."
1,i had high hopes,"when i heard maybe i deserve i thought, this guy is someone i will like. he just grabbed me. i couldnt wait for this cd to come out. i ran to the store and bought it.... and i was highly disappointed. no other song anything like maybe i deserve on the whole thing. nothing for me i really do hope that he grows as an artist and holds onto his career because i wanna like his music i love his voice and the song maybe i deserve but i didnt like this cd. his 2nd one (one man) was better, but still not the level i want to see him on. basically i would say dont buy this, maybe buy one man if your curious, but keep your eyes out for this man because i really think with the right material he could be one of my favorites."
2,Ido deserve,I think I deserve my money back. Tank has good vocals but the songs don't enhance them at all. After a while everything sounds the same. Keep you money.
2,...ouch...,"maybe this deserves to be better...'deserve' is the best and only song worth repeated listening...maybe because it's the only song that tank wrote and produced himself...he must owe the other producers some past favors to have let them put those mediocre beats on here...plus i got tired of tank shouting them out at the start of some of his songs (i guess he wanted us to know who to blame for those tracks)....on the upside, brotha tank has an excellent voice, kinda reminds me of some jeffrey osborne. the lyrics are a disappointment, sounds like some songs that destiny's child might'a rejected which is saying a lot!"
5,perfect party favour,Cute and fun little duckies. They ended up being not too duable when actually thrown in the water at bathtime or the pool.
2,Bad paint.,"We got 3 dozens different rubber ducks from Amazon and this group is the worst dozen. The paint feels like it is not completely dried and it rubbed off on the bodies of the ducks. Also, these ducks do not quack/squeak because the blow hole is not on the bottom, it is where the mouth is; these ducks are more like water squirters."
3,"So-So writing /interesting book, though","This was not a bad book, but, I think the fact that it's a translation from the French does give it it a stiff quality. (I think there is also a ghostwriter involved.) Also, the initial leap from present to past is somewhat awkward in execution (the first chapter begins like a memoir in the first-person, then proceeds into a novel, occasionally returning to the first-person.)There were parts of this book that were better than others, particularly when the action was restrained to the characters of Nikolai & Fanny (where the writing really came alive), but then, there were sections that dragged a bit (for me, the sections written in the first-person).However, the story grew on me, and it always held my interest. I think 3 stars is a fair rating as I don't think I'd want to read this one again, which is my criteria for a 4 or 5 star read."
1,Monster movies,"I would like to know why so many of the monster movies from the late fifties and the sixties are NEVER released on Region 2 DVD.There is quite a big market here in the UK and Europe for these films, and yet they are never released here, but are all availble in the US on region 1.Why is this?"
3,Definately for the Practitioner,"I needed this book for a Financial Statement Analysis class. It is a decent book, full of examples, so that makes it very interesting; however, the themes are very repetitive. It not an exciting book by any stretch, but it does have some usefulness."
2,EPA/DHA amounts??,"they are too secretive in showing the epa/dha amounts. i went to their site and had to really look to find and then calculate amounts per cap. they are showing 160mg EPA, 107mg DHA per cap. usual amounts are 180/120. odd they are different then reg levels and odd they dont disclose it easier. may be fine product... dont know."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,I was a little bit skeptical about these bags because of the price. I am on a tight budget but didn't want leather because it isn't water tight. These were even better than I expected them to be! Great deal for the money. Look like leather but without the water worries and maintenance issues.Added bonus was they arrived really quickly!Update....A couple of months since I wrote this review and the seams are just starting to unravel at the stress points. Still happy overall but this is not likely to hold up to the test of time.
3,INCREDIBLY scary.....,"I decided to watch this movie at my brother's behest; he did NOT warn me that this would be incredibly scary. The fact that the situations were based on events that could've occurred did not help put me at ease. When Clarence Williams III screams maniacally, ""WELCOME....TO HELL!!!"" near the movie's end, it's all one can do not to run quickly into his or her bedroom and pull the covers up over one's head.It definitely keeps in line with the horror genre: graphic violence, supernatural occurrences, etc."
3,"Okay, but too dayum preachy!","When I watch a horror flick, I just want to be at the edge of my seat wondering whether or not if the boogy man is around the corner. I liked the twist at the end of this movie, and I loved the story with the little boy and the abusive father, but there were messages all through it that was being shoved down my throat when all I wanted is some cheesy fun! The last story was something that I would expect in that HBO drama series OZ, not in a horror flick. Lighten UP!"
5,A Haw River Genius,"Dale's book, from the word go, is astonishing. His control of of craft is clear. By this, I mean that he understands character's nuance, plot's highs and lows, Bill Harrison's ""what is obligatory,"" and, most of all, the holy necessity of knowing what is holy. Here, find selves with hands thrown from windows on the way to the outer banks. Find crooks and painters and would be horse shoe throwers. And find yourself, caught up in the dazzle of brilliant fiction. Buy this book. Or I'm out now, looking for you."
3,"A bit too good at failure, perhaps.","These stories seem to lack something like ""credibility."" At times the author simply tries too hard. There is so much failure and so much reason for failure that the stories wear down the characters to a point where I found it difficult to care. One has to be trying in order to fail, right? And in this sense it was difficult to find anything redeeming in the people involved. Rather than feel like they were caught up in bad situations I simply felt like they were fantastically and creatively stupid. As if one wakes up and asks, Just how pathetic can I be this month and how will I get there? The author provides an answer that is just a bit too thick. These people are just a little too good at mucking it up.Perhaps it was a mistake to read this collection in one sitting. The stories work together nicely, but break it up if you feel your heart falling asleep."
3,"Good, but with problems","It's a decent book, but I have two beefs with it. Beef #1 is that there are quite a few recipes taken straight from the Biochemical Machine. Since this is a companion recipe book, I expected it to make references to the original without exact copies. My second beef is that some of the recipes are incomplete. I have found several that fail to mention all the ingredients. For example, one recipe calls for potatoes, 2-4 cups of oil, sour cream, and chives. Nowhere in the description are the chives or the oil mentioned. There are about 1/2 a dozen occurrences of this that I've found so far. Some of these you can deduce what needs to be done, but others (like the one mentioned above) leave you utterly clueless. That said, there are several really excellent looking recipes in this book and I think it is a valuable addition to anyone following the A&B method. I just would have liked to have seen more originality and more attention to detail."
3,Two enjoyable westerns,Both films are enjoyable 50's era westerns. The scenery in Cattle Queen of Montanta is as stunningly beautiful as Rhonda Fleming is in Tennesse's Partner. Get comfy with a blanket and bowl of popcorn and enjoy....
2,It is not cheap to buy it here anymore!,Ive used blue buffalo for last 3 years!. Amazon has change and prices and availability... I.e. they no longer sell 30lb. End tge price no is high!!I just bought same product ( 15lb ) at petsupplies.com for a total price of $ 31.79Thats more than $ 11 difference and it got here very fast!...Your Welcone! ;)
3,VitaHound Recommends for Cleaning Dog Teeth,This product contains high quality sources for its protein ingredients. The products high protein content improves a dog's oral health. VitaHound believes cleaning dog teeth is important to the over all health of dogs.
2,Agree on the diarrhea,"My German Shepherd was served Blue as a puppy so I tried it for a while. Changed to another brand, and due to the unavailability of it I used Blue again. Even when I stopped feeding it to him a nightmare of a couple of weeks followed. I will not take the chance of using it again."
2,Not too bad or good,"The book seems ok for a noob like me, since i'm not an expert i can not give an acurate rating on how good the book is compared to others, but it was easy to understand and the software make it easy. BUT there in the software was my main problem, because for some reason it just was immposible to install it propertly. Just the simple fact that i was using 2 hard drives becomes a problem during installation, the Java never seems to work right and the interface never worked right. I did make it work at the end, but toke me a long time and a lot of work. So that's why it sucks."
1,"many errors, poor software","The software is Java based, tends to freeze up, and is not accurate. I found many errors in the book in CNC format and programming terminology. Download a free simulator from the web and purchase a better book if you want to learn CNC trade properly."
3,Close Shave...,"Molly (Millie Perkins) is a cocktail waitress in a bar. She is also a schizoid murderer on a rampage! You see, Molly was horribly abused as a child by her freakish father, leaving her w/ no alternative other than to castrate any man that deserves it. Molly is guided in her mission by helpful TV commercials that tell her what needs to be done. THE WITCH WHO CAME FROM THE SEA is an interesting, often tedius relic from the wacky 70s. While Perkins is decent in her role, the rest of the cast is like drift-wood. However, the story isn't terrible, and I never tire of seeing groovy fashions and hearing people say, ""Far out!""..."
3,"I suppose it's great for travel, BUT","One of the tags that is used for this product is ""TSA."" There is no WAY you would be able to use this as a TSA approved 311 bag. The bottles are great, (I put some of them in a ziploc bag for a flight) they don't leak at all. Also, the tray at the bottom seems to hold the bottles snugly. Again, however, you wouldn't be able to use this as a TSA approved 311 bag, and the other ones that you WOULD be able to use as one from this company are rated too low for me to buy one. I think it would be great if they could make a smaller version of this in clear plastic, that way you COULD take it on a plane with no hassle."
5,It's an album with mad lyrics and beats.,"Eminem has been on the dl for a long time now. I first heard his work about a year ago. I was instantly hooked to his style of rap. It's simple, yet intricate. Eminem keeps it real by expressing his feelings through his lyrics. He truly is an original. I also give him props for staying with it; most white rappers are unsuccesful. Keep it up Eminem!"
1,Pretty awful stuff,I think this is the worst music I've ever heard! So this is what people are listening to these days? I see no difference between Eminem and Britney Spears. Canned garbage either way. They should get married and have lots of children--their progeny would almost certainly cannibalize them both!
4,"Inspirational, heart warming, family movie.",This is a very well acted family movie. We first saw it on a christian tv channel and knew we had to buy it for our library.It has a surprise ending that will touch the hardest heart. It is a movie you will want to see over and over.
3,"Looks Cool, but Not For Pros","This is a good looking strap, but is a little flimsy for heavy use. The 2"" width is not enough if you are going to be playing for more than an hour or so at a time. I would recommend you look for a wider, real-leather strap if you plan to play a lot. You get what you pay for with this strap."
2,Print is WAYYY too small,The print is WAYYYYYYYYYY too small on the map . I tried to use it - even with cheater reading glasses ( which I don't even usually need to use!)So I ended up just leaving it in my suitcase at my hotel.
4,I found that taking Dr. Art Ulene's Optimal ...,"I found that taking Dr. Art Ulene's Optimal Vitamin Formula for Women was very beneficial. I don't usually take vitamins, but I find that I have much more energy and just generally feel better. Normally I have a very hard time taking any vitamins with iron, but found that I didn't have any problem with these. The only drawback is that I don't like having to swallow six vitamins a day. It's worth it, though, since they seem to work well."
5,The Galbraiths and the Kootenays,"The book was in very good condition, as advertised. The delivery was much earlier than anticipated. The only thing that was disappointing was the amount for postage and handling. All in all was very satisfying. I was looking for information about my family tree, my gggrandfather Thomas S. Baker married Anna Jane Galbraith, this was verified in the book."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I originally looked at this book because it had information on something that I was interested in -- propagation. However, I am now a little bit wiser.The reason this book is disappointing to me is only 1/3 is related to general care of cacti. The other 2/3's of the book focuses on common species of cacti and how to take care of that particular species. I also find this to be inaccurate, because care of species also depends a lot on what type of environment you put them in. My recommendation is if you are looking for a book on how to care for cacti, look a little bit longer."
3,It was okay...,"Luckily I found this book on sale because I probably would have been a lot more disappointed if I had paid more than [price]for it. The beginning section I found to be rather interesting, it's more of a general care section. The rest of the book however are tips for more specific species. If you have one of these species of cacti or succulents, it is a bit informative. If you're looking for a very general book, with some general tips, it's an okay book. If you're looking for something in depth, don't get this book because you'll be highly disappointed."
2,"""No Strings"" a two-ballad wonder","I bought this album out of loyalty to two songs Richard Rodgers wrote for this show, the title tune and the opening and closing song, ""The Sweetest Sounds."" Both aregreat. There are also some OK songs--""Look No Further,"" for example. I don't know what happened to other reviewers--earwax in their iPods?-- but take their idea of ""No Strings"" as a great Rodgers score with a BIG grain of salt. Most of the other songs are completely forgetable (following Hammerstein's death Rodgers may have thought he could compose the noodly sort of lyrics that his partner was cranking out toward the end of HIS career, but Mr. Rodgers was, in this case, wrong. Some of Hammerstein's later simplicity actually gets by [""My Favorite Things"" from ""SofM"" is an example], but Rodgers' own ""comic"" or light lyrics STINK). Richard Kiley was starred over Diahann Carroll in the original, but hers is the bigger contribution, at least to the music here."
3,"Review by GMC level 1, 2006","I like the book ""Hot Hot Hot"". Neal Layton is the author and the illustrator. The book is about the Ice age. In the summer it gets hotter and hotter. Oscar cuts his hair. He cuts Arabellas too. I think children would like this book"
5,Awesome,All I can say is that this CD is terrific! Memorable melodies and harmonies; obvious talented and creative musicians;lyrics that stay with you after you hear them. This band is a show-stealer!
4,Very nice product,"I just bought one of these for use with an older 30GB iPod and a new Nano. Installation took about 10 minutes using the provided template. It's the perfect ""morning"" device, enabling me to listen to TV channels, weather forecasts, radio stations, or my iPod while making the morning coffee.Sound quality is very good, as are the nice touches like the kitchen timer, and the ability to play the iPod whether the draw is open or closed."
3,Causing Problems With IPOD??,"Easy to install, clean design, everything works well. Sounds like a pair of $20.00 computer speakers, but that's what I expected. Radio works great. Mini audio jack would make it compatible with all other MP3 players. My 4th gen Ipod went on the blink within 2 week of use with the dock. I replaced the Ipod battery and it is working fine again. I don't like the fact that it seams to always want to charge the Ipod whether it needs it or not. The Ipod is starting to give me trouble again and I'm getting weary of docking it to the Ihome. I haven't heard of this problem form any other users so maybe my Ipod has a more serious issue."
1,OVER PRICED,Don't buy this product from Amazon at this ridiculous mark up. It was recently on sale at reputable store for 14.99 and is listed today at 34.99... Amazon's price is nearly double!!!!
5,I Could Not Live Without This Powder!,"When I was first introduced to this product, I was a bit skeptical. However, I now can't live without it. This is perfect for redness and those of us with the t-zone. If you live in a humid climate this is a must have!I wear it under and over my make-up. It takes all the oil away instantly and prevents it from showing up throughout the day. It's completely invisible, too.LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!"
1,A waste of money,"Great concept but utterly unreliable. After various malfunctions was advised by a reputable repairer not to bother wasting more money on this. NB I look after my things, did not submerge watch or anything like that. Spend your money on something else."
4,"Great Sound, Nice Size","I found the sound to be excellent on this unit, especially given the smaller size. Crystal clear sound even at maximum volume. Much better than I expected. I wasn't able to get any sound until I inserted the batteries (4 AA) so I would consider that a drawback. I have no idea how long those batteries will last yet. There is a separate backup battery for the clock in case of a power outage. It comes with a nice travel case as well as a remote that can pause/play the iPod. Overall I am pleased with my purchase."
4,iLove my iHome,"This iHome is great. I take it on all my trips. It charges my iPod, and it comes with the remote which is probably my favorite part. The remote even has a snooze button, so you can have the unit across the room and activate snooze from the bed. My only problems is that the lowest volume setting is still kinda loud. And the travel pouch can really only fit the unit and the remote. Still a great player though."
2,Great but wrong,"This unit was great, sound quality good for such a small package. But, I ordered silver, they sent black and it was supposed to play an Ipod Nano 5th generation.It did. But it did not charge the nano. So you can wake to glorious music then the battery dies beacause all night without recharging. I was not happy especially cause this had been a gift.It did close on a good note. Amazon was even greater in that they took the unit back and quickly provided a credit rebate. Thank you Amazon, this is a strong reason I continue to shop at Amazon. If they make a mistake, they take care of You."
1,Definately NOT Rated GP!,"This is an unbearable tape supposedly about guinea pigs--however, they hardly ever appear. The two live guinea guinea pigs who make cameo appearences clearly wish they were somewhere else--you will be too, if you're unlucky enough to watch it. My main beef--besides the material recycled from all the other videos in the Pocket Pets series--is that they describe ways guinea pigs can be tortured or killed through ill care and do so to humerous music and skits. Even those of you might recieve this tape for free will think it cost too much! END"
2,I need to make an exchange.,I need to exchange this Detroit Tigers cap for a larger-sized one. Please let me know how I can do it. Thanks.
3,Odd timing still happy,"Got here at a really wierd time. It said it would'nt come till like march. Still, saved me like 200 bucks!"
5,Dr. Art Ulene's Vitamin Formula for Men is ...,"Dr. Art Ulene's Vitamin Formula for Men is a well-rounded product. This mix of vitamins and minerals gives me the energy I need every day. Individual packets make it easy to take all the pills I need, instead of opening multiple bottles. In this busy world, we need all the advantages we can get. Most people don't eat right. This product makes it a snap to take care of yourself."
3,"Very Enjoyable, Recommended for Movie Buffs","I don't believe I've seen more than two of Mazursky's films but I enjoyed his book, especially the juicy chapter on his adventures with the increasingly more bizarre Peter Sellers. This is not a biography, but rather a series of essays about his involvement with different Hollywood people and some chapters about his current life and childhood. Recommended."
2,Not Up To Par,I have seen better Blu Ray on this subject matter. It does not live up to the Planet Earth standards by no means.
3,a competent book of poetry,"I fully expected to love this book - rural setting, conciseness influenced by far Eastern poetry, political and religious awareness. All the poems are well written - but neither images, word usage or emotion stick in the reader's memory. Yes, there are a few exceptions: ""You (the earth)were hungry / like us / for seed"" in ""the earth"" or from ""the old teacher"": ""that's how he wanted to help us ' construct the world: / solid everyday life/ and occasional expeditions / inward to the borders of mystery."" But there are few enough exceptions for me to recommend this book only to those with a specific interest in Scandanavian or Norwegian poetry."
5,Simply Stunning,"The writing of this book is lyrical in its prose, and yet terrifying in its portrait of lives destroyed by war. I gaurantee you will be haunted by this incredible book long after reading it."
5,Keyboards never sounded so good...,"These Guys do it all... Their other albums are satire-laden punk rock. This EP is high-energy, emotional indie rock. They use Keyboards like no one else does- (They use their heads to play them live!) See them live! They won't disapoint. I'm looking forward to the new album!"
5,A Great Reference Guide!,"This little gem continues to amaze me! Everytime I get stumped with my son's math terminology or the mechanics of a math problem I turn to this reference book and the answer is always there. If there is one book you should own to help your children with their math, this is it!"
5,Great Buy!!,"I purchased 2 sets of this stoneware for everyday use because my wife was tired of looking at our 20 year old Corelleware. I had purchased and still have another service for 8(different Misaka) when I was in Scottsdale, Arizona a few years ago for $500. I must admit, my both sets arrived promptly with no damage and are extremely elegant looking. There are only two adults in our household, so I really am not concerned about the breakage factor. My most pleasant surprise was the $112 price for the service for eight! This was just fantastic. A service for one( 5 piece) is still being sold on this site for $50. Why not buy this set for $6 more?"
5,Fantastic!,"Please don't consider this a ""tribute"" CD to Trane. Pharoah Sanders is an absolute master of the tenor sax in his own right. He's earned it. Lonnie's lament makes me cry when I hear it...this man is deep. Great tone and phrasing. Please give him and his wonderful band the respect and admiration they all deserve. Amazing music, amazing talent."
2,"ZzzzZZ A Sleep Fest, Terrible Up-Tempo Songs","This album is a mess. I can't see how someone can enjoy this water downed repetive recycled boring over the top sex trying to hard to be a wannabe fake R. Kelly bad singing trying to hit high notes but failed miserably songs. Marques Houston is an embarrassment and if I was him, I would walk around with a bag over my big ass watermelon head. First and formost that Naked video was an absolut blantant knockoff which is probably the only reason why this immature I'm trying to showcase my growth as an artist song is even getting spins. If you want to show some growth first of all come with something original and stop trying to copy everyone else. Copying everyone will not keep you relivent very long. The point is come correct or dont come at all. Skip this album and buy something that is worth more then 15 dollars. B***H come with I'm a hater. I know someone is about to call me one because I have my own opinion."
5,Do You Mind....,"I LOVE MH!!!!!!!! This album shows a more intimate side of him. My favorite song is ""Do You Mind"". I can't stop listening to it. I was a little disappointed after reading who wrote what songs that he didn't write the lyrics to my favorites. The album is still great. It makes you want to get real close to someone. Hey it even made me go by tickects for the scream 4 tour...yeah my grown ass is going to be at the concert screaming for MH...lol This is a definate must buy. Albums with less tracks have more to offer these days and this is one of them. So go get and get close to someone!"
1,"Boring, repetitive","I kept hoping I was at the end of this book (Kindle) but it went on and on and on. What he had to say, which is little, could have been said in 10 or so pages. Awful, boring piece of work."
2,Not a great one by the Buk,"While this book had some very funny moments, I'd hardly recommend anyone read it. In a nut shell, it's 260 pages of Buk talking about all the girls ...over a 10 year period. Oh, and he drank a lot. ...I did laugh out loud in a few parts, but I'd stick with ""Ham on Rye"" or ""Post office"" if you want to read some good stuff by this maniac."
5,Reality,"Women is a book about life. The life that we can't possibly imagine. Most of us simply go through life without even a hint of Chinaksi (I'm convinced he is no different that Charles himself) in our lives. Those days that do have a little Bukowski in us we remember for eternity.In Women, Bukowski writes about a ugly old man who has gone unloved for too long. But a change comes over this lonely man as he begins more and more relationships with women. His irrational thought makes any real person laugh and smile. He speaks about them, with them, with a complete disregard for everything, except the reader. He knows how to make the common person laugh; at his incredible optimism, and his look on life. Chinaski may in fact be a lot like our shadow. Those of you who have seen Fight Club, might know all about this."
3,A excelent book in a poor paper.,"The book is excelent, but the quality of the paper is very poor, practically disposable."
2,Not at all what I expected,"I pre ordered this book as soon as it was listed expecting to get four nuts and bolts books in one. This book is more about project managing a website than it is about how to use the tools in Studio MX. There are 12 pages about the history of typography alone. And although I don't generally mind a few rough edges, this book clearly went to press before it's time. It is packed with annoying grammatical errors and bad typeset. In fact, immediately after a 2 page diatribe on the misuse of single quotes, there is a sentence that contains 5 double quotes. To my knowledge, they should always be used in pairs.It appears as though the authors set out to write a Studio MX bible in a short amount of time, and when they fell short on material, they resorted to writing about their life experiences instead."
4,will(s),"I certainly agree with ""online Steven"": Billy stewart's 2 greatest hits were ""Sitting In The Park"" & ""I Do Love You"". They are also 2 of his most unrecognized & most under-rated efforts. ""Summertime"" is only OK...it's too ""motor-mouthed"" for me. Of course, Billy's moniker was rightfully ""Motor Mouth."" One certainly gets a taste of that in the other 2 tracks both from 1965."
2,I have very thick hair and this product ...,I have very thick hair and this product didn't offer the deeper conditioning I need. I need a product that also serves as a de-tangling product -- many conditioners make it easier for me to get the snarls out. I wasn't pleased with this product. It may work better on someone with finer hair.
4,"Well, I didn't hate the Neutrogena Clean Balancing ...","Well, I didn't hate the Neutrogena Clean Balancing Conditioner for Normal Hair. It was okay and I wouldn't have a problem using it again, but it would be unlikely that I'd go out of my way to buy it. There are simply other products out there for the same (or less) amount of money that work better."
5,"Hold the Schmaltz, This is Jewish Cooking","Wonderful recipes, new versions of family favorites without the schmaltz.I am sending it to my mother for Hannukah!"
5,Praying God's Word,"Praying God's Word is a wonderful tool for devotions. You find when you don't have the words, they have already been put in writing in God's Word, either as a prayer from someone else who's felt the same way, or through a promise of God already declared. This is such an encouragement.Well written by Beth Moore, including inserts from others who have gone through the very topics and found the answers and help from where we should always seek it - the heart and Word of God through Jesus Christ."
5,Excellent . . . a worthwhile purchase!,I bought this book to do a bible study with some women in my church. I am so thankful for this book because Beth Moore really helps you learn how to pray God's word . . . how to personalize scripture in your prayer life. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to dig deeper into God's word and break free from personal strongholds.
5,Great Book,This is a very good book. I would highly recommend this book if there are areas in your life where you need deliverance.
3,Mediocre,"This book is a great book in teaching you how to pray by the scripture. The Chapters are laid out by our strongholds, although I found some of her scriptures to not coincide with their chapter totally. In some cases, I even thought her scripture prayers applied to more than just the specified stronghold, yet one might be apt to skip over a chapter in fear of it not applying to them. This is my first Beth Moore book. I am sure she is a wonderful writer; in fact I loved what she had to say in each chapter. I just think the book layout was a bit awkward."
2,Good read!!!,"This book did not meet my expectations in its exposition of breaking strongholds; nevertheless, a good read. I have read more substantive and power-packed books on strongholds."
5,A Tremendous Treasure,"""Praying God's Word"" by Beth Moore isn't necessarily a book you read...it's a book you USE!! I carry this book to work with me regularly and have it handy at home all the time. Her introductory words are uplifting and helpful. The scripture she chooses and the way she rephrases it into prayer gives me applicable words to work with as I bring my own struggles before the Lord. I am so thankful for Beth Moore and the many wonderful books and Bible Studies she has produced. As a teacher, I have done two of her studies so far and will begin another one this week for our ladies' class. I thank God for Beth Moore and the wisdom our Heavenly Father has instilled in her for teaching the Word."
5,Great book,Worth reading over and over again. It is a timeless read and Go always gives me one more nugget of truth I missed before.
2,"had promise, but man was it poorly produced","I liked the women in this movie. I liked what they were trying to accomplish. I was rooting for them. That said, I have seen better crafted (produced, shot, edited) documentaries done by 6th graders. The production value was seriously atrocious, and I would venture to say, maybe the worst I've ever seen. Would I recommend watching it? Yes, I think so. But only if you can overlook the homespun, ""I did this in my basement as I had time"" feel."
3,Remember gang it's 64 not 46.,"Oh woe is me..I thought this CD was from 1946 not 1964! The first part of the CD is from 1964 Live Guard Sessions which has Tex and Miller alumni playing ""Chattanooga Choo Choo"" , ""Little Brown Jug"" (with help by the Modernaires), ""In the Mood"" and of course ""Pennsylvania 6-5000"". Now I'm not so sure any ""real"" Miller alumni played on this since there is no real listing of who or what was played on the liner notes. I'm only saying this because the music is pretty life-less. The second half of the CD is Tex with the Ray Block Orchestra (?). That pretty much says it all right there! Now the 1946 outfit Tex had thats a real musical group with some fire in its belly..ie Bobby Nichols and the whole trumpet section and Lillian Lane's beautiful singing! I love Tex and own just about everything he's ever put out, but this CD most people could do without. It's really only for those Miller fanatics who can't live without one more version of ""In the Mood""."
1,Be careful! Back part is too low!,"First time I wore these socks, I got blisters on the achilles of my both feet, because the back part of these socks is way too short. Had to finish my training with my shoes off and send the socks right to trash bin after that first use"
3,"More ""Cottony"" feeling than I wanted","These socks aren't bad, I have just been spoiled but my pair ofBridgedale Lo SocksandSmartWool Men's Adrenaline Light Micro Sport Sock. These Adidas fit nice but feel heavy and do not breathe as well as I had hoped. After a few hours of wearing in warmer weather they feel damp. The price is decent though."
1,They're too thick,"I don't understand the purpose of these socks, they are ankle high so you won't use them in the winter but they are very thick so you can't use them in the summer as your feet will feel on fire."
4,Lavender Popcorn... Groovy,"Deep thoughts courtesy of a group called Scrugg. Fans of pre-Tommy Who (A Quick One and Sell Out) and The Hollies will enjoy this over hour-long collection of lesser-known bands from the era. There are many gems in this collection such as I Wish I Was Five, Goodbye Thimble Mill Lane, Smile A Litle Smile For Me (Rosemary), Major To Minor, and Tamaris Khan. Also included is another version of Pictures Of Matchstickmen (by The Status Quo) called Black Veils of Melancholy. Suprisingly, most of these songs are still fresh.For a lighthearted revistitation of an era in music that will never come again, check this collection out.[DW]"
1,Reconsider! (Before You Walk Away With This CD),"I should have heeded the other Amazon reviewer's wise advice to steer clear of this CD. But being a Brenda Holloway fan and completist, I had to have it. After one listen, up for grabs it goes, never to darken my CD player again. Although Brenda is under-rehearsed and not in the best of voice, much of the fault of this third-rate CD lies at the feet of the producer(s) and the label. Horrendous sound glitches throughout, bad mixing and editing; just a really amateur effort. One of the worst ""live"" albums I've heard in awhile, and there have been alot of them over the years. Do yourself a favor and get Universal/Spectrum's 2-CD Brenda anthology with her Motown studio sessions from the 1960s, and pass up this travesty."
2,I know what is wrong with the audio on this DVD!,"I bought this DVD with very high expectations, not because of the documentary, which almost nobody will watch more than once or twice, but because of the complete Audio concert promised on the packaging. It is all about the music after all. But the packaging also promises Stereo sound, but in two different DVD players, I was not able to find the Stereo soundtrack. A lot of people do not necessarily have a 5.1 setup and/or prefer to listen to music in stereo rather than 5.1. But if you try to listen to a 5.1 soundtrack on a stereo setup, it sounds just like this DVD: unbalanced at times, hollow at other times. So the question is: how do you get the stereo soundtrack promised in the packaging?"
2,Fairly Tepid Really,"Uninspired interviews...other releases cover this stuff better...the sound is muddled...Roger mumbles too much...I was not inspired to continue on to the second disc. Some nice stuff for die hard fans, but to not have a fully filmed concert from that tour at the center of the release is a real shame. 3 hours of interviews can easily be scrunched onto one disc. Fellowship of the Ring is 3 hours on one disc. They could easily have put the video of the concert on the second disc. At least the audio should be able to be played in standard CD players...will we see a separate release? I give it high marks for the effort, but the gems here are only for real die hard fans...but the rest is nothing that most any fan hasn't already heard. It's hard to celebrate 35 years of a band without at least a few words from past members. As an aside about Alan's american accent...it's just becoming muddled from all the time spent in Seattle...but it's always been that soft lilting kind of accent..."
2,Very Disappointed,"I guess I didn't read the cover of this DVD close enough. So that others don't make the same mistake, read closely:** THIS IS NOT A CONCERT DVD **It is a series of interview snippets clustered around small segments of live footage. The interviews were pretty bland and did not flow at all. Most of what each member said was pretty trite - although I thought Alan White's comments were the best.Why YES would put out a 2-disc DVD and NOT have full songs included is beyond me? This would have worked MUCH better if they had sandwiched the interviews between full-song concert footage.The track listing of songs are audio-only, but the sound mix on these is utterly terrible. Certain songs start out great (Awaken, Don't Kill The Whales), but when the full band comes in, the bass and drums sound muted and distant - which is a problem with the way this thing was mixed (not the performance).Save you money. This one is a dog."
1,disappointment,"This may be the worst Yes dvd since Keys To Ascension. It's basically just extremely boring interviews. And hosted by Roger Daltry? What the hell? In the interviews, the band is pretty much repeating all they've said in the Yesyears video. They said it better years ago on that video. To add insult to injury, the second disc has an AUDIO ONLY of the concert! Whose lame idea was this? You can't even play it in a standard cd player. Only in the dvd player. While it's playing, it just shows still shots of the band. What a waste! They could have easily shown the concert on one disc and had all the interviews on the other disc. But for some reason, they didn't do that. Also on this dvd, the interviews are only from current band members. You won't see people like Trevor Rabin, Tony Kaye, or Bill Bruford anywhere. This dvd is just pathetic! The ONLY reasons to buy this dvd is if you've never seen Yesyears, or if you've never heard anything Yes did before 2000."
4,VERY INFORMATIVE,"If you bought this DVD hoping to get a concert with the classic lineup, you will be disappointed. However, if you want to learn more about the band and see what they do in their everyday life and behind the scenes stuff, this DVD is for you. I got mine for about $19.00. I thought it was well worth it.As far as the concert goes, there is one. However, I guess they didn't want to put three discs in the set. That's how many it would've taken to do the interviews plus the concert video. So, to keep it down to two discs, they used still photos from the concert instead. I still enjoyed it and felt that I was watching them play live. So, for $19, I think it was well worth it."
2,Frustrating sound quality,"this earpiece is the cutest thing you've ever seen. it really is. but all it does is sits in my drawer because its the most frustrating thing to use. the sound quality is very staticky, even if i'm holding the phone right in front of my face. and that's right after i have fully charged it. its a cute, overpriced, piece of crap."
3,"first one i recv didnt work, 2nd one is decent","When I recv the bluetooth in the mail noone could me at all ,so i sent it back at my cost 8 bucks!!! and got another a week or so later...its ok but it really annoyed me that I had to pay becase the product they sent me didnt work..."
5,Mr,"An exelent product, it works well with my treo 680. I am replacing the motorola H650 which was not nearly as good and caused my Palm to crash all the time."
1,one of the worst bluetooth deavice you can buy,"this bluetooth headset is probably one of the worst you can ever waste money on.For some odd reason all of my motorola bluetooth, including this one has really really bad static.I cannot clearly hear the other person and the other person cannot hear me.I would save my money and buy a different brand altogether.Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset"
2,Poor sound,"The headset pair's very easy but the sound is poor. It's like listening to a 60's radio in your ear. On the other hand, if you use it for more than ten minutes, it is very uncomfortable"
4,Still works after laundering!,"I love this headset! It's small enough to fit in snug jeans, and with the boom closed it doesn't turn itself on. Unfortunately I left it in my jeans when I did laundry and was distressed when I took the jeans out of the dryer and found it in the pocket. It didn't turn on and I assumed it was dead, but being an optimist I plugged it into the AC charger. The red charging light came on, and after charging it worked like new - and it was clean! It fits loosely over the ear and I've had no problem with it falling off, even though I have long hair. I can walk away from the phone into another room before the static starts. I hear others clearly. The reason why I gave it four stars is because at times others tell me they can't hear me clearly. Their reception usually gets better if I fiddle with it. Mostly people don't tell me it's a problem so I assume they're hearing me fine. I will definitely buy this again when the time comes."
4,Sound headset but low battery life,"The unit works well and I have tried it for months with several phones. But battery life could be longer.Fits your ear very well, confortable."
2,Bluetooth H700,"This headset had alot of breakup during use. I have another one of these from a different vendor that works well, but this one did not."
2,"Great at first, but not durable","I've owned two of these. It is great that it rests against your ear, and is very comfortable not having an earpiece sticking in your ear. The first one I owned, after a month, lost most of its volume. I could not make the volume louder via the volume control; the volume control actually never seemed to work, but at least at first the volume was real good...for about a month. The second one I bought lasted about 9 months, but now the button to answer or hang up on a call does not work."
4,Not for big ears,"Great performance, even works well in the wind. But, having fairly big ears, it is not very comfortable for me. Also unique charger plug differs from all other Motorola charger plugs I have seen, so order the splitter accessory"
5,Bluetooth H-700 Review,Very Satisfied with my recent purchase a Motorola H-700 Bluetooth Headset for my cell phone.
1,Didn't work!,"The product seemed to be really good and online ratings (and my husband's referral) were relatively good for this product. So I was excited when it finally arrived, and I opened it to get started right away. After repeated attempts to match the headset with the phone, and more than an hour on the phone with tech support. I had to pack the thing up and send it to the manufacturer for a new product. Luckily, this had a happy ending in that I received the next model up and it works beautifully! All is well that ends well."
2,not as good as the H710,My husband has had the H710 for a while & needed a replacement I - mistakenly order the H700 & thought it wouldn't make much of a difference - well it did - the reception was not near as clear as the H710 - I would not recommend the 700 - am having trouble finding the 710 & have order the 720 - have not yet received it - hope it works as well as the 710 did
2,ear piece,I have one that looks just like this and it works great! I loveit. THis one is not working well. IT dropps calls. I feel like i have to charge it all the time
1,motorola h500 is a flop,"After having the Motorola H500 , I decided to step up to the H700. BIG MISTAKE! This earpiece was the WORST EVER!First the ear loop is very stiff trying to open. it is poorly made and chips at the bottom or top. Now the earpiece fits poorly. replacement loops are $12-$15 for a pair.The fit is very uncomfortable for me. Ive had several brands and this is the most irritating earpiece ive ever owned. The ringer has a cheap tinny sound and it doesnt increase the volume enough to hear in many conditions.while charging the light goes from red to yellow to green when fully charged. the light doesnt go off, so you have a bright green nite light all night. ( if you need a night light.i would NOT recommend this product to anyone."
4,H700C purchased late Jan2007,"I paired the Motorola H700 with a Samsung M500 by following the instructions and it worked perfectly. I charge it at night and keep the mike closed when I'm not using it. I wasn't sure I would benefit from the wireless technology, as the wired earphones worked just fine. I use the wireless H700 much more than I used the wired earphones both at home and in the car. I like the voice dial and the Sprint Voice Command service to make the connection and I use I make more calls due the extra convenience. I added a Contact called Voice with the phone number of *, which then connects to the Sprint Voice Command list I uploaded earlier. I sounds kind of geeky, but it saves me from entering lots of phone numbers that I may only need occasionally. I haven't had the occasion to leave walk too far from my phone, so distance is not an issue. It is comfortable to wear, despite some rubbing on the back of my ear at first."
5,Best headset ever,Best headset ever! I've purchased more than 8 headsets in the last year and none of them worked. They were too large for my ears; difficult to hear; poked inside my ear; fell apart within days. This headset is like my old headset that I loved except it is just the right size and so easy to use. There is a mouthpiece that when closed to the base turns off the headset and when opened turns it on. It is clear as day and easy to use. I highly recommend it; you won't be sorry.
1,Motorola Quality Issues,"I used another Motorola H700 bluetooth headset for 2-1/2 years and was generally quite happy with it. When that one failed, I ordered another. The first unit that came seemed slow to charge, but eventually the red light came on and I was able to charge it, pair it with my phone, and use it. Unfortunately, the volume was much lower than the previous one and there was a lot of added noise. I sent this unit back and received a replacement. The replacement one wouldn't even take a charge; after 12 hours (partly with a known good charger) it still shined red.At this point, I don't know if Motorola has a manufacturing problem or if rejected or counterfeit units are infiltrating the supply chain."
3,Motorola Bluetooth Headset - H700,"this headset is smaller than than the HS850, and so is the range. i've experienced static when more than 10 feet away from my phone, but other than that, it seems to work just fine. i've used it in the car and haven't had any problems hearing others or being heard. as long as you're not paying too much for this headset, you'll get your money's worth. be aware of which version you are buying and who you are buying from. DO NOT buy from gateway_wireless. the headset came in dubious packaging (it looked like it had been opened before) and worked well enough the first week. now it doesn't work at all."
1,Stops working after only a year,"This was great for the first 18 months or so, easy to pair, held a good charge etc. Then mine just stopped working one day. People could no longer hear me - I could hear them but they couldn't hear me. I thought maybe it was just a fluke; that I got one from a bad batch but then about a month later the same exact thing happened with my husband's.You can buy it as long as your expectation is that it will only work for one year."
2,Completely one-sided,"This film is completely one-sided. The filmmakers don't interview anyone with a different point of view than themselves. They say they ""tried"" to reach the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, but that they ""didn't speak to filmmakers."" OK, then go find 10 doctors who don't represent ACOG, and have them tell you in rational terms why all OB/GYN's aren't evil, money-grubbing monsters. I think they have a valid reason to want to encourage mothers to consider their options. I also agree that we have medicalized pregnancy in America. But at least try to present both sides accurately. Don't just use angry midwives and PhD's who have an axe to grind as your experts."
1,Very Disappointing,"I wish I could give this movie less than 1 star. I won't repeat what all the other negative reviews have said, but I completely agree. I support ANY method of birth the mother and father choose and feel most comfortable with, and am so thankful there is free choice in the matter. I know women who have had beautiful births at home/in birthing center, however this movie made me feel angry toward that option. I don't believe the filmmaker did any favors to the midwifery system with this film."
1,So what did his wife think?,"I can't begin to describe how irritating I found this movie. Although I am totally pro home-birth and alarmed by the birth statistics in the US, I could not get past how self-absorbed the filmmaker/father was. I really regret having watching this film, except for the brief clips of Ina May Gaskin. She's awesome and outshines any penny-ante Michael Moore wannabes."
2,Dirty South,With the help from all the superstars you would think this cd would be off the hook. But unfortunately not. I have one word for this cd. Garbage. The only reason why it gets two stars is because the guest tried too help...
5,New Orleans Sketches,"This isn't a REAL review just a suggestion for all those fellow Faulkner fans out there who may not have come across this book, a collection of some of his first published writing for the New Orleans newspaper. This book is a jewel and puts Faulkner fans on alert that wonderful writing is coming down the road. It shows to me that he was born a great writer. He wasn't merely developing his talent. He was born this way. I'm an old lady and have loved Faulkner for years but I never heard of this book until recently. Beginning writers have so much to learn from him and those who don't write and have no plans to but love to read will find Faulkner in a special, wonderful category all by himself. And this book is a wonderful place to begin an exploration of this great writer."
1,Worst wiper blades ever!,"These wiper blades are excellent at cleaning the glass. They leave a silicon coating behind that allows the rain to sheet off at high speeds. The coating doesn't work as well as rain-x. Rain-x starts sheeting around 45-50mph, the piaa wipers coating not until 60+mph. However, any time you need to use your wipers they leave a white streak across the windshield that doesn't disappear for a second or two. At night, the streaking catches all surrounding light and is blinding. It's like someone flashing their bright lights at you every time the wipers go across the windshield. The silicon residue is a great idea in theory, but in practice they are the WORST WIPERS EVER! They're DANGEROUS!"
2,"ok, nothing special, wasted money","it works, but no more than cheap ones. A cheap blade and rainx would have same effect. After one month blade is already streaking windshield."
2,Bad DVD Transfer and color emphasis,"The movie was - well....ok - the plot was confusing and strange -overall however, worth watching. The DVD transfer, however was terrible. The color changes drove me nuts. I think this was done on purpose to enhance the film but it was done in very bad taste. I kept thinking there was something wrong with my new TV - it became obvious that the director kept messing with color and lighting from scene to scene. Sometimes the picture was perfect and stunning - most of the time, however, it was too red, too yellow, etc.If you rent this DVD - it isn't alien's messing with your TV - it is a very bad Film to DVD transfer and the director messing with colors."
5,Nurse Oscar Snub,Renee Zellwegger clearly gave the best performance of the year here and yet erin boobovich walk's away with an Oscar.This movie was pure brilliance and an unspoken gem
3,Missed the balance between funny and serious,"Trying to be both funny and dramatic, this film falls flat because of an untrained use of violence and balance. Clumsily disturbing, this movie falls flat of its comedic potential, interesting premise and decent cast. In the end it leaves nothing more than a half-smile and a sour stomach."
5,Darker than I ever imagined,I really liked this movie. It's like the LAST fifteen minutes are the best. It brings everything together. But the rest of the movie has to be watched to get there. Let me with a chill.
2,extremely sad,"This movie is not a comedy. There is not one funny thing in it. It is a story of a naive young woman who dissociates from reality during extreme stress and comes to believe that she is a character in a soap opera. This, played by the winningly innocent Renee Zellweger, who is a modern day Marilyn Monroe. All the rest of the characters are cynical, ugly people who circle around Betty like shades. The movie is an utterly unfunny, searingly sad portrayal of an innocent young woman buffeted by the vile cynicism of the world around her."
3,"""Here's an idea--","how about a BEING THERE/PULP FICTION kinda thing. The main character'll be a woman in this, but the smart people will still be African-American."""
4,A Great read!!,Nevermind that you don't understand everything that's going on in the story... that's what's great about SF!I was very pleased with the pace of this book. It moved at just the right pace and found you skipping because there were no boring parts.The characters aren't that deep but just deep enough to keep you wanting more. Bandie's character develops at just the right pace for the book but not so much that you don't want to move on to the next one.I'm ready for book 2!
3,ES,INTERESTING PREMISE BUT MANY AREAS ARE NOT FILLED OUT VERY WELL ESPECIALLY THE MOTIVATION OF THE ALIEN CHARACTERS AND MACHINES.
