3,Good book but not the five stars,Otherland was a great novel but five stars it was not. If you can get through the first 300 pages of the book then you're fine. I found it enjoyable after those 300 but before hand it was a chanllenge to continue. Questions on top of questions is not the way I normally view life. Otherland is a break from the normal and if you like that then read the book. Get past those first 300 pages and I can honestly say you'll enjoy it. I did.
3,A good part one to a story in 4 books,"Otherland is one giant story broken into 4 books so you can lift it to read it. Each book does not stand alone, so don't start unless you're in for the long haul.The VR worlds are well described and each has its own distinct feel. But sometimes the book became a travelog, with the characters jumping to the next world for no purpose but to have it described. In fact, the characters themselves sometimes share this feeling.The characters are also well fleshed out with their own sets of strengths and weaknesses. The author lets us into the heads of many of them, granting further insight into their feelings and motivation. By the fourth book, you know them almost too well, and they do very little additional growing.So while I enjoyed the story enough to read all 3000 pages, and found large parts of it to be excellent, there where enough slow and /or annoying part to bring it to 3 stars over all."
2,Cardio workout,"The music is great, but I wish we could find out how many beats per minute are on each song before buying. Also whether or not the music is mixed continuously or each song is individual ( as in this case)."
5,Great book,"If you are interested in this part of WWII, be sure to read this one. It is well written and easy to read. No ranting, no theorizing, just plain reality. I just finished the book and I can't stop hurting for little Gretl!"
4,Surviving as a Jew under the Nazis,"Some Jews delayed their departure from Germany in the pre-WW2 period, and some never had the chance - either way they were trapped in a very hostile environment. This is one such story - how a young woman lived through several near-disasters, and finally ended up in a very safe situation - which again became unsafe when the Nazis were defeated. Tension is ever-present, and occasional humour or unintended irony. It was an interesting read for me."
5,Just what I was looking for.,"When several machine heads broke on my Epiphone DR-100 acoustic guitar I had to find a new set. I didn't want to make new holes in the head so the selection was pretty limited. I decided to try this set because machines looked almost identical to original ones. First of all, they turned out to be much better-built than originals. Second, the installation went almost perfect (almost because the holes didn't match 100%). Overall, the machine heads do their job really well, though I still have to fine-tune my guitar every time before I start to play. I'm not sure if they are the best you could possibly find, but they absolutely matched all my expectations!"
1,junk,"These machine heads are so cheaply made I returned them and put a set of Grover's on a crappy guitar I found on the street. I didn't even bother to install them. Chrome plated low grade steel, wobbly, and I doubt they would hold a guitar in tune for long. Gearing is cheap and not sealed (well, I guess the back of the headstock would 'enclose' them) and the plating I'm sure will crack off in no time. Even the screws are cheap.I would seriously reconsider getting these if you like quality, even for playable crappy guitars(which is what I wanted them for). I just couldn't put them on any instrument, unless it's a free, horrible sounding guitar that you wanted to sell. But then again, if music and fine instruments aren't your thing, then these might be for you."
4,Creative Cranium,"My family adores this game. My son begs us to play it all the time! We have a great time together playing this game, it is fairly exciting and not your same old Monopoly (although we like that game too)! Fun for the whole family even different ages!"
5,EXPLICIT A.C. LYRICS!!!!!!!! DIE!!!,More NOISE from the master's..this time featureing a duet with a female!!!''JUST THE TWO OF US..WE CAN MAKE IT IF WE TRY'' with SETH making the sound of a RETARD while some sexey sounding broad sings the main part..HAHA GENIUS!!This one sound's even more ANGRY than usaual!!Evereyone need's these early A.C. album's..as we need them as weapon's..against the so called ''NORMAL PEOPLE''!!When the world end's you no damn well it will be because everey A.C. album was played at once..on every stereo on EARTH!!MANDATORY FOR THE NOISE FAN!!!!
3,I think some of you are missing the point...,"I like old-school grindcore (Napalm Death, Carcass, Brutal Truth, etc.) A.C.'s music is typical of this genre - fast blasts of guitars and drums with harsh vocals. This isn't conventional heavy metal and certainly shouldn't be compared to bands like Slipknot or Slayer, let alone anything radio-friendly. Anyone looking for conventional heavy music should look elsewhere and stop wasting their time giving a critique of something they don't understand. As far as this style of music is concerned, A.C. are kind of mediocre."
5,"Two Books,one great writer!","I wrote a review on this book before and also on ""Dark Passions"" by A.J. Ciulla. I haven't read either of my reviews. Both books are great. A.J. Ciulla shines !!!"
5,fun for toddlers,"I bought this video when my daughter was 2, she is now 3 1/2 & still loves to move & grove! Though I think over the age of 5 kids would be bored. It's best suited for toddlers & pre-k children."
5,Great DVD,This DVD is a terrific way to learn the basics of kettlebells and then how to work the various exercises into a credible workout.
2,This is effective but way too boring,"The instructor knows what she's doing and the exercises are well taught. But the quality of the video is poor and the instructor is rather dull and lacks personality. Additionally, the background music is repetitive and boring. The exercises are fine to do, but between each one there is about 60 seconds to rest, which is fine, but fun music to move in place or something would be so much better than what's there, which is basically nothing. This is a good DVD to learn some exercises from, but it is way to boring to use more than a couple of times."
4,Revamping Snow White,"Combine Snow White, Animal House and Revenge of The Nerds and you have Syndey White.This modern retelling fairytale of Snow White. It follows a beautiful college freshman Syndey White (played by Amanda Bynes) as she pledges her late mother's sorority. But after discovering that today's sisterhood is not what it used to be, Sydney makes new home away from home with seven nerdy outcasts. With the help of her new friends, Sydney will take on Rachel, the reigning campus queen (Sara Paxton) to attempt to transform the school's misguided social hierarchyBynes is great with her cheerleading style. The film is a cute send up with a Revenge of the Nerds twist.It is cute for an evening entertainmentBennet Pomerantz Audioworld"
3,"NOTHING NEW, BUT ENJOYABLE ROMANTIC COMEDY!","I watched this film with an open mind, because Amanda Bynes while appealing still relies too much on rolling her baby blues instead of her acting chops. This is a mildly funny film with some help from some quirky characters. The theme loosely follows Snow White and the 7 Dwarves, but I'll be damned if I could tell what dwarves they were supposed to be. Sleepy was easy enough, but Dopey/Happy?, Doc/Sneezy?, Grumpy/Bashful? seamed to all have little traits of each dwarf, this probably worked for the better and gave it a fresher feel. Bynes is a cutie pie and I'm sure she will mature in her acting as she matures in life. It's not a bad film and it was easy to watch."
2,"""Are You Kidding Me?!""","What are you people smoking here?! This must have been Amanda Bynes last role in fulfillment of a contract; either that, or she's got a really bad director, because this movie is as unfocused as she is. I was going to say untalented as well, but in the right part she actually has a two-dimensional appeal; only this isn't it.It's billed as a re-telling of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, but that's an insult to the Brothers Grimm. This ""D"" list movie doesn't even have the class of Kathy Griffin. Like Danny Strong's ""Gurkin"" says at the end of Act Two ""Things are looking grim brothers,"" and a truer word was never spoken. I just wish that it had come at the start of the movie and spared me the hour forty-eight that I wasted watching it."
3,I like it........but that's me.,"It's more than decent. Not half as good as ""Bow Down"" but when you compare it to rap these days, I bet all the people calling this album wack back in 2003 feel stupid. The production is definitely lacking, but the rhymes are good. Especially Cube, WC is still dope, but Mack 10 kind of fell of with his skills.Best songs.Call 9-1-1.Get Ignit (the title suggest that it's just a stupid song resembling current rap, but it's actually a good song).Lights Out.Izm.Gangsta Nation (as with any album, you can't expect the lead single to be the best song, but this is decent).Potential Victims.So Many Rappers In Love (Funny, and to some people saying they're hypocrits for dissing love-song rappers.....there is a huge difference between having a loving spouse and children and rapping about it, what do you expect them to be single forever just so you'll think they're hard. Newsflash, Cube's been with his wife since he was in N.W.A.)"
2,Terrorist Treats (Osama Bin Ice Cream),"This is a pretty weak ass boring rap album, man I couldn't say too many good things about it. I mean I do like the songs Gangsta Nation (cuase it has the funniest beat ever, reminds me of like a horror ride at a amusment park) and So Many Rappers in Love cuase I guess it's just kinda funny how at the begining he's like ""Aquarius"" and then ""I love poetry and flowers, girl I just love you"". But how could they say F a ho if they are married (Mack and Cube)? Anyways if you want good gansta get a Woodie cd or a Brotha Lynch cd, man if you want REAL gansta get an X-Raided cd, there is a reason that homeboy is on deathrow. As for these guys, I'm look at my watch and 16 minutes have passed. Ice, your not a good actor, you only did good in Three Kings cause you were with Clooney and your rap career is over RETIRE! All those other guys... keep it gansta homies!"
5,"Quality Product, solid value","I am a member of our county's Search and Rescue team that covers the Lake Tahoe area and have invested literally thousands of dollars to ensure I have the right equipment for the broad array of weather that we experience. I have few ponchos and prefer them for rainy days down to about 40 degrees .This one is easily the best of the bunch and the only one I carry in my SAR pack. Openings on the side, rather than the front keep the water out, even during driven rain, and allow for better air circulation. Draw strings for the hood offer better heat retention and prevent the hood from flapping around or blowing off your head during windy conditions. The best feature of this poncho is the material itself. It is very rugged, yet light and does have that sticky, tacky feel that is common with cheaper ponchos.Not the cheapest on the market, but definitely the best value I've found."
5,"So Far, It's A Great Toolset","I haven't had a chance to really put this to the test, but this is a great combination of tools. The knife is sturdy and the various tools slide out smoothly. It's very compact and lightweight as well. Perfect for a daypack, purse or men's shoulder bag."
1,THIS IS AWFUL!,"I bought this primer because my usual brand is quite expensive and wanted to find something more economical. Apparently you get what you pay for. It goes on your face like paint and is bright orange. Of all the brands I have tried, this is the absolute worst!"
4,Excellent Reference,"This textbook reads more like an encyclopedia than a normal textbook. The presentation of the material is very thorough and accurate yet assumes a reader more mature in the material. I am using the text in a materials behavior course as a senior in mechanical engineering and many of my classmates have come to similar conclusions. Both my professor for the course and another in the same field also agreed the text is probably better suited as a reference rather than a stand-alone teaching tool. Overall, excellent text but maybe more useful for a more learned reader than I."
5,HARDCORE CHICAGO,"The one and only Delta 9, straight from Chicago who makes the the roughest hardcore techno there is..... Fast beats ripping your brain apart, and hammering it till your head is about to explode. Beats ranging from 160 up to 360bpm. Signed under Industrial Strenght & EarAche records. Working with other famous hardcore dj's includind Lenny Dee (aka Tamper Tantrum)and D.O.A."
4,Works well,Allows me to plug my stereo headphones into my 600 and get stereo sound out via the MP3 software. Only gripe is that this piece is necessary at all. I often forget to bring it since I switch back and forth between using it with the 600 and not using it with my laptop.
1,Not recommend,"The battery is too weak and it can power the machine for 8 minutes (first time w/ 24 hours fully charged). Since it is made of NiCd, the performance will be worse after several uses. Furthermore, the motor is too weak to get the water in. According to my experience, it will take back around 30% of the water. I don't recommend this machine unless you got it with a really good deal."
4,solid book on the pixies long overdue,"Well put together in the style of Please Kill Me which is basically a linear compilation of quotes from those involved describing anecdotes and the chain of events that was the story of this great band. Commentators include everyone from the Pixies themselves to their peers like J Mascis and Throwing Muses, to those they influenced like Billy Corgan and Courtney Love to their engineers/producers like Albini and Gil Norton. As well as those that discovered and signed the band. A fascinating read for anyone who appreciates the Pixies and the amazing music they created. Very candid and enjoyable read."
4,Please Don't Kill Me,"This book is an interesting read, a good depiction of the 80s and the Boston indie scene. One has to be a Pixies fan to really enjoy it; I don't think it would be interesting enough for just any other kind of reader. As stated by the authors, this book is not about sex, drugs and the usual self-destroying existence of rock and rollers. This book is about a band that has a very average life but happens to make the best music ever."
2,where's the flip side?,"Those in the west who remember Kyu Sakamoto for hisbreakthrough hit ""Sukiyaki"" will find that song andnot much more to like on this cd. In particular, itwas a staggering blunder to omit the flip side of sukiyaki,namely ""Anoko no namaewa"", from this collection of his25(!) top hits.If anyone knows of a cd containing the latter song, thisreviewer would appreciate hearing of it."
3,Harmless But Average,"Feast of Love features a series of amorous encounters cenetered around an Oregon coffee shop called Jitters, owned and operated by Bradley Smith, played by Greg Kinnear. The film provides a fairly luminous galaxy of stars such as Kinnear, Morgan Freeman and Jane Alexander the chance to play roles at which they excel: Kinnear as the amiable, aw-shucks but clueless lead role, Freeman as the sage dispenser of wisdom dispensed to other characters through dialogue and to the audience through voiceovers, Alexander as the loving but saddened nurturer, and so on. Trouble is, the script doesn't offer them the chance to do much beyond what we already know they can do. The movie doesn't set out to achieve much. It's like watching your favorite ballplayer hit a home run in a game your favorite team doesn't win. Nice, but the end result is disappointing. Feast of Love is clearly a rental, not a purchase."
3,A multi-course feast,"The stories of the foibles of love are told through the narration of Dr. Harry Stevenson (Morgan Freeman). He and his wife, Esther (Alexander) are coping with old age and the loss of their son. He's also occasionally a sage advisor for others, but in the end realizes he still has much to learn.Harry watches as Bradley (Kinnear) misses it when his wife Kathy (Blair) falls in love with another woman (Katic). Bradley continues a spiral of relationships until the right woman comes along quite by accident.Harry recommends that Bradley hire 20-ish Chloe (Davalos) when his barista Oscar (Hemingway) falls for her. Then, Dr. Stevenson, who thought he was so sage about love learns the most valuable lesson from Chloe.""Feast"" is a multi-generation tale of love with lessons for people of all ages. Note: there are some explicit scenes including a lesbian relationship. The film's based on the novel by Charles Baxter and directed by Robert Benton."
3,Feast of Hell,"There was very little about love in this movie. The big lesson pushed in this movie (right up to the point of actually saying it) is love is just a game being played on us to help us procreate. This movie contains more life lessons like ""How to cheat on your future husband....repeatedly"", ""How to chop off your own finger"", ""How to avoid your boyfriend's alcoholic, violent father"", ""How to turn your wife over to a lesbian"", and ""How to lose your new, young husband to unexpected cardiac arrest.""The title and back cover of this movie are very deceiving. You've been warned."
2,An interesting mess,"Mr. Conrad has a fascinating idea here, but his execution is crazy. As noted elsewhere, many of his excerpts are absurdly short, and he talks in between every example. He should have trusted his idea and let the scenes do the talking.And it's beyond absurd that he includes a long excerpt from his own work."
4,...Cam(e) back to attack...,"After displaying a different vibe with the live studio mix of K7's Dj Kicks, Cam revisits that Jazz Vault that was prominent on his ""Mad Blunted Jazz"" album. rase1bannon made mention in a review of Cam's ""French Connection"" that Cam is not as ""groundbreaking"" as Krush or Shadow. I would venture to say, that what makes Shadow ""groundbreaking"" is how he took the baseline from Metallica's ""Orion"" and used it in ""The number song"". Well if ""Friends and Enemies"", ""Essences""(of any part), or ""Hip Hop Pioneers"" does nothing for you, then at least wonder how a guy from France watches ""Interview with the Vampire"" and takes the opening theme and makes it into one of the Hardest yet most beautiful tracks ""Twilight Zone"". Pretty ""groundbreaking"" really."
3,Beautiful,The flowers are beautiful. The directions seem simple and easy to follow. I was a little upset that the pictures are small and hard to see. I was also expecting some canework or skinner blends to be done in making the flowers. Maybe the kindle edition was the wrong thing to buy. I probably should have purchased the actual book. I am anxious to get started making beautiful flower bouquets.Kathie
5,David is back!,To the guy who wrote the review april 7.David is back I saw morbid angel with soulfly and the show was awesome! They played lots of classics! oh yeah really good live cd.
2,Great music but beware of the growls & grunts,"Battlelore is a great metal band with excellent musicianship and terrific female vocals, and the album is a compelling metal-operatic fantasy based on Tolkein; unfortunately on all but one track the songs are ruined for me by (sorry, fans) the prominence of death metal styled grunted vocals, something I fail to see any attraction in. If you enjoy that sort of thing that you are sure to really enjoy this album; but if you find no pleasure in grunted, growling, roaring vocals, then steer clear. 2003's Sword's Song and 2006's Where The Shadows Lie seem to be less growlingly intrusive in the vocal department."
2,Odd bitter taste; not like Postum.,"If you are looking for a substitute for the discontinued Kraft hot drink mix Postum, Pero doesn't taste much like Postum. Postum had a much smoother, slightly sweet taste. Pero has a bitter flavor, which to me tastes like stale coffee. If you are a coffee drinker and want to cut down on caffeine, a good decaf coffee tastes much better than Pero.By the way, Postum was made from from wheat bran, wheat, molasses, and maltodextrin made from from corn. The ingredients of Pero are malted barley, barley, and chicory; so it is quite different."
3,It really does not taste like coffee,"I was a 3 to 5 cup coffee drinker per day. I had to stop drinking coffee because of acid reflex. Drinking tea isn't the same as coffee. A friend told me about PERO so I tried it. It does not taste like coffee. I drink it on weekends only, but I wouldn't recommend it."
5,GOOD HEALTHY HOT BEVERAGE,i HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT AND HAVE HAD 2 STINTS IN MY HEART DUE TO BLOCKAGE OF MY MAIN ARTERY. NO CAFFEINE FOR ME! THIS BEVERAGE IS JUST AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER THAN COFFEE AND IT'S TOTALLY NATURAL.
2,It's not Postum,Thank you for the comparison. The only similarity I found between Postum & Pero are the ingredients. The conclusion I came to is processing & amounts of individual ingredients must hold the keys to the differences in texture & taste. I am not a fan of the powdery Pero.
3,Early Patterson Pretty Smokin',"This is the first of the ""Paget Trilogy"" and is a pretty decent book. Let's remember Patterson was 29 when he wrote this back in 1979. I guess that could explain the dope references, which didn't bother me at all. A flawed main protagonist??? Oh my God, The HORROR!!! Easy read that will set you up for the much better ""Degree of Guilt""."
2,Lacking quality,"Some of the information is useful but it is hard to focus on that information when the recording is so poorly done, with constant changes in sound and background noise it is extremely frustrating to watch. I had read the previous reviews and was extremely happy when this arrived. I have really enjoyed studying David Coleman's work and was hoping since this was done by him it would have been much more properly handled in filming and his descriptions but as is I am highly disappointed. Honestly I have seen better video and description on youtube for $30 I had expected a lot more."
1,A Reader from Laguna Hills - is DEAD wrong!,"As I stated, I purchased 3 of the cards, and they did work, but with green or red snow on all of the LCD's I tried. nVidia came out and stated that they did not support Hercules in their implimentation of DVI, and they will not support the DVI on the GeForce 2 without an external TMDS trasmitter.I stated only facts that I could prove in my post,No official support for the VI interface (DFP or DVI)No mention of a non-linear powr supply, but ech support insists on onepoor driverspoor build quality of the card2 bios revisions in 2 weeks,etc."
1,Really poor layout dilutes average information,"Looks like it was written and designed in a weekend, not well thought out in either respect. Obviously not much background in working with really serious golfers by the author"
3,"""NO, I don't feel 'fleeced' - - at least, NOT QUITE !""","""Fleecie the Lamb"" . . . a Beanie Baby of great renown . . . doesn't quite match the picture on this page. I was hoping for a lamb with that pink plumpness, and ""Fleecie"" truly is all white and a rather limp, even scrawny creature.However, it has a certain pathetic appeal - - and Reviewer mcHAIKU feels that ANY lamb symbolizes the ""Lamb of God"" & thus is considerably more appropriate in an Easter Basket than the pagan symbol, a rabbit!Whichever child wakes up to find ""FLEECIE"" looking undernourished on a bed of shredded green cellophane will doubtless accept it with familial affection - - and rate it higher than my 3 stars."
5,Classic,"This album continues to rank high with me-Pretty much wore the vinyl out ,but the CD has some great new liner notes which the vinyl never did. Puts the time frame in perspective......If you are a Scene fan, this is one to have in the collection...."
3,Not As Expected,"I thought I was buying the same hat I saw on someone working at a garden store; turns out this hat was not exactly the same; did not have the nice features the hat I saw had i.e. ""fishnet like"" flaps. It was ok but I thought it would be too hot. I ended up returning it."
2,Not worth the price,"The camera feels solid and it is, quite easy to use. The fixed focus and no choice of compression mode make it impossible to get a sharp picture, espacially with nature shots. It always comes out fuzzy. I regret my purchase."
3,The battery life is horrible.,"The camera is decent for the price. What I really don't like is the battery juice just gets sucked out. I constantly have to recharge my batteries and it's really a pain. Plus, the battery holder broke. Now I have to hold it together with tape."
4,A Perfect Trade of Skills,"Robin Rimbaud - mobile phone conversation pirate, and Michael Wells - Long standing hardcore meister. Both of which have only noticeably impacted on the fringes of the dance/electronic genre. Never before have the two shone so brightly. They have obviously fed off each other in scanner vs. signs ov chaos - using the best elements of each others styles. Michael's productions sound like the very best of scanner, and Robin's the very best of signs ov chaos. The two michael jackson's are worlds apart yet of the same substance and Robin's mix makes me feel all ""worm"" inside. mothlight is one of the loveliest dark ambient piece I have heard in an eon, and the simple, yet tasteful breakbeats in kink had me playing the track over and over and over while I worked. An awesome album, even if you didn't enjoy previous releases by these two artistes. Hopefully soon we will hear ""the revenge of scanner vs. signs ov chaos"""
2,Sigh,"I got this for my anxiety, have something to keep my hands busy. The day it was delivered and I took it out, I really liked the way it felt. However, not even four hours after anxiously squeezing it - not even hard! - and massaging it in my hand, I felt something wet. It was leaking. I instantly got depressed. It may not have been much, but still, it was a big waste of money."
2,Not much beyond the cute title,"The cover of this book declares that you'll learn ""Ten Simple Truths That Lead To an Amazing Life."" If your idea of an amazing life can be distilled to ""eat, drink, and be merry,"" then perhaps you'll see value in the sophomoric platitudes that abound in this book. Alfred E. Neuman, of Mad Magazine, with his declaration of ""What, me? Worry?"" provides a pithier statement of the philosophy proposed by Ms. LaRoche. If you're looking for some deeper meaning to life, to success, to accomplishment, you'd be much better served by reading Napoleon Hill, Anthony Robbins, Dr. Covey, Denis Waitley, or Brian Tracey."
1,Don't bother,What the picture fails to show you is the back of the necklace. The back of the neclace is hollow. The front of the necklace looks great but the back looks horrible. I returned this item right after I got it. Don't bother with this item. I thought this item would be a good substitute to the tiffany's version but this doesn't even come close
4,the best i've used,"Of all the photo papers I've used with my HP printers (832, 932), this has been the best performing paper, doing far better than a specialty paper (Pictorico), and somewhat better than the Kodak papers in color accuracy. Whether it will work as well with other brand printers I do not know, but I can only recommend it highly for HP printers.It would be nice if it cost less, but HP, like the other inkjet makers, intends to mint money on its inkjet supplies. And like almost all inkjet papers using water based inks, the prints are vulnerable to all water based liquids, including fingerprints."
1,$20 for just ONE ankle sleeve,"Found out way too late that there is a Bunga Skater's Kit (2pcs x 2.5"" gel discs, 2pcs x 5"" ankle sleeves and 1pc x aluminum style BungaBox) s for about $43-$45, while this ONE ankle sleeve I purchased from Trader Jay trough Amazon cost me with shipping almost $20. I had to place another order so I don't loose money for the shipping. The ankle sleeve is great to have it, but the price is just not right. Trader Jay advertise ""Bunga PadS""- making us believe there are 2 not one pad, but just so you know, you are getting just one- SCAM"
2,What went wrong?,"This book started so well. A lost scout for the good side gets caught behind enemy lines. He accidentally becomes the wielder of an amazing sword, but doesn't know what it does. He is able to get back to his own forces. His own magicians study and discover some of the features of the sword. The generals decide this will be their secret weapon. The scout becomes their designated assasin. Wonderful! Then something goes wrong. Characters are talked about without any contribution to the storyline. The focus becomes the dull time spent between assasinations. Then the war ends by an act of god with no involvement by the main character! But that's not where the book ends. After a wonderful start that leaves open so many avenues for weaving an intricate tale, the author seems to have given up. Just like a wood chip thrown into a river, the hero is a victim of circumstances even though he has possibly the most powerful weapon on the planet"
2,Make it work,"My daughter had fun decorating her box but the craft glue had dried and sealed so I have to cut open the bottle to use that. Everything went on beautifully but nothing stayed on. We let everything dry and the second time she opened it the skirt started falling off, then jewels started popping off, even the glitter flue peeled off! I would say affix everything with craft glue but there wasn't enough to do that so you would have to have your own. We also had trouble with the musical workings at first. Dad was thankfully able to fiddle with it enough to get it moving and after a day or two of on/off working it finally works correctly every time. So the product isn't high quality but is ok for the price if you are willing to put in a little extra effort to make it work."
4,when it works,"I have had no battery problems and have gotten amazingly great pictures inside and outside....however, it is now in New Jersey being repaired for the second time in 2 1/2 years. First the lens cover wouldn't retract. Now it is in because it will only come up ""ERR CARD"" when turned on. The good news is it is now under the warrenty from the first repair, so no charge this time. It is a lot of fun when it works."
2,Ok but not fine!,"Have used the Fine Pix for 8-months now.My PERSONAL experience with it:Pluses: Reliable, easy to operate, nice combination of features, small and handy (but see below), battery life: ok for about 25-35 pictures.Minuses: Have to work hard to get sharp pictures - usually I do not succeed; not really a 'pocket' camera; red-eye reduction never worked with my kids.Overall: If you can get it for $300 it is a good deal, current price of $500+ seems too expansive for what you get."
3,Fuji 4700,"The Fuji has most of the good ergonomics of the earlier model but they have mysteriously changed the battery system. Both the Fuji and the Leica models had an internally chargeable battery which lasted well and was very convenient. The 4700 requires AA batteries-if you use the screen, they will not last long. I've also found frequent and vexing problems with the camera not wanting to accept smartmedia cards it previously used. This is intermitent but annoying enough to warrant testing a card before you rely on it. The camera is a nice weight and produces great pictures but I am not sure that it's a quantum leap over its predecessor."
4,Nice Camera... where's the website?,"I tried this camera out over the weekend. It's quite handy... the size is really nice, and the lens retracts into the case with a real metal shutter to protect it. The user interface is decent, and the LCD is readable in most conditions. The second ""control"" LCD was a cool design, allowing the user to reuse buttons in both camera and playback modes.I have to agree with others that the image quality is good, but perhaps not to the levels that I've seen with the real 3MP cameras. This is certainly not a true 4MP camera... look at it as a 3MP camera that makes bigger files.I needed to find the manual, since I was borrowing the camera from a friend. I went to fujifilm.com, and was really disappointed with the offering -- I couldn't even find a _mention_ of this camera, let alone drivers/software/manuals! I had much better results on www.fujifilm.ca, their canadian site. The manual and information on the camera was easy to find there."
3,Read the description before buying,"I didn't read the description carefully enough and did not realize this deck had to be used with the Rush Hour Traffic Jam Game. I bought it for a Secret Santa swap in my 9 year old's class but since I have no idea if the person he is buying for has the Rush Hour Traffic Jam Game or not this deck of cards is pretty much useless to us. I like the idea of the game, however, and think it would be fun and challenging if you have everything you need to play it. Just make sure you don't make the same mistake I did and assume this pack of cards is a game in and of itself!"
4,Tamarack Technologies 2400 FS Film Scanner,"I was able to produce high quality 8x10 pics of scanned slides. for the price, this is an excellent scanner for beginners."
1,YUK!!! STAY AWAY!!!,"When I could get this unit to work, it was ok. But since the manufacturer went out of business in August 2000, tech support is nil, and I can't get it to work on a new machine."
1,Needs Better Software,"I bought this scanner and have had no luck getting the software to install properly, let alone get the unit itself running. I went to photographyreview.com and their site noted that a)Tamarack is out of business and b) that I needed to get Documan 3.0 software to run my scanner properly, not the 2.3 version that came with my unit.I went online to Tamarack's barebones support site and downloaded all the patches and installed them. Still no results.Since Tamarack is OOB and Documan is their software, I'm out of luck! AArgh! Does anyone have a copy of 3.0 they can burn for me and mail to me? I'd be willing to pay for time & materials.Any help would be much appreciated.Otherwise, I have a very expensive ... paperweight.Thanks,Mark Sagerholm..."
5,An exceptional book for teaching foundational Biblical truths to young ones,"This wonderful book overviews the entire scope of Biblical teachings, from a topical rather than an historical perspective. It is well-organized and explains Bible truths using illustrations and language that are very clear yet accurate for young children. Also, it explains Biblical doctrines in a way that is very oriented toward life rather than just an intellectual exercise.It would be preferable if the artwork were slightly more up-to-date and the Bible verses and hymn excerpts were in easier language for younger children. But these are certainly not show-stoppers.I was looking for a book to help me explain the basic truths of the Bible to our 6 and 5 y.o. in a way they could grasp clearly. For this purpose I don't think I could have found a better book than this."
3,Paperback was old,I wanted it for reading only - it was an old printing but not torn - just yellowed from age. Have read both books and hope to see a movie one day.
2,Wasn't very impressed,I though the lotion and shower/shave gel was better. Did leave my skin softer than other shaving creams it just didn't really impress me for the price of it. Buy the shower/shave gel it is better for shaving I think.
3,Fascinating if Flawed,"Definitely worth a look-see, for all the great photos and tidbits on performers famous and obscure (though where were Lyda Roberti? Olive Thomas? Judy Tyler?). Lots of factual errors, which I guess is unavoidable in a compendium of this sort. Still, a great guilty pleasure. If you like this sort of thing, you'll like this sort of thing."
4,Almost Everyone Is Here,"This is a big book with many stars, classic, silent, modern, etc. People I have never heard of like Cathy O'Donnell, Tom Tyler, and Dorothy Dell are even here. A few are missing, a few photos were labeled with the wrong people, like Heather O'Rourke, and the circumstances surrounding their deaths is rather small in some cases. If you want more details you might be disappointed, but overall a good book to have."
2,Stick to mysteries,"I am a huge Patricia Cornwell fan, but I did not enjoy this book at all. It was a little dark, but not in a fun way. And the moral at the end did not make sense to me."
5,The best tool assortment,"This is the most useful Swiss Army Knife I've owned, and I've owned several models. The scissors are larger than on previous knives I've had. The saw works great, and is perfect for cutting a walking stick to size. The can opener is quick and easy to use, and of course the knife blade is shaving sharp. I've used the tweezers to remove bee stingers. I can't imagine not having this small, useful tool with me at all times. I think it's the best option of all of the Swiss Army models."
1,Victorinox Swiss Army Huntsman Pocket Knife,"The knife we ordered was supposed to be new or in new condition, however when it arrived it had scratches on the handle. We returned the knife and purchased a new one for approximately the same price at a retail store. Our account has not been credited for the returned knife."
5,Safe In The Shepherd's Arms,This book is wonderful. It is just the right length. I like it because I am a busy mother and I don't have long extended periods of time to myself. I was able to start and stop at my leisure. This makes a great gift also.
5,I love her,"I love this woman,I met her and I am in rhis book. I just wish I could contact her now. 11 people I know recognised me from her more than accurate description of me. Thanks Rochelle, the book is hysterical, best read of the year especially for me. No I wan't the King or the date who trod on fish nor am I married, but maybe I will be, I have a new lease of life."
5,Computer Geek Favorite,"My husband requested these thermometers for Christmas. He's had them in the past (still has one, but another died a slow death after he banged it around in an office move). We use them in various places around the house, depending on what purpose he has for them (changes from day to day). Right now he has one in our furnace closet with a probe up near the attic vent hole (monitoring the air coming in from our attic - we like to be efficient here) and two in the office (one over each of his computers with the probes in front of the exhaust ports on the Micro ATX sized computers). We have another Oregon Scientific item (one of their weather stations) with a remote sensor that will be put outside. We have found OS products to be very reliable."
2,WARNING,"They are not clear enough that this RC toy car DOES NOT steer like a traditional RC toy car. This toy moves ONLY in two directions: forward, and it only turns going in reverse = NOT FUN TOY."
2,A thermometer not matched its name,"Both Amazon and the package itself indicate this thermometer has a feature called ""HiGlo(tm) electro-luminescent backlight for easy night viewing"". The picture in Amazon also shows this feature. However, the user guide provided in package neither tells how to use this feature nor mentions it at all. I have tried blindly for all buttons and even multiple buttons together, and could not get backlit to work.Other than that, the look is awkward. Two very wide bars on either side of the LCD. It also lacks of humidityOnly good thing is shows both indoor and outdoor on one screen, eliminating the need to push channel button three times to review outdoor temperature and come back."
1,"""Authentic Druidism?""","This book is a pathetic ripoff of the 17th century book of Fferlyt written by Iolo Morganwg. A ripoff of a forgery to boot. For anyone interested in ""Authentic Druidism"" I would recommend Peter Berresford Ellis' book THE DRUIDS."
4,The utmost regards,"I have heard many differing opinions on this Work, and I have to disagree with most of them. I consider this book as a framework for Practical druidism. I know many would disagree with my opinions and those stated in the Book, but it rings true to my ears and practices. I would be willing to reccomend it to anyone would would ask it of me. I should point out however that many would refute my veiws, and I can accept that. If nothing else, at least give it a read over. I HOWEVER, CAN ATTEST TO ITS METHODS AND IDEOLOGIES.regards,Taliere"
2,Ripping Tale,"This is a pretty good work of fiction; I think it can stand up very well as that and only as that. It does provide yet another point of view on the Arthurian legends and is intriguing for that reason if for no other. One should not look to it as a guidebook into the Old Ways, though. It is overly romantic in its depiction of a very warlike and brutal people whose main source of income was the raid on other clans. War was a virtue, not the NewAge Fluffbunny philosophy in this book. The author is less influenced by the ancient Celts of Central and Western Europe than he is by the Flower Children of Southern California.It's published by Llewellyn, so accruacy and credibility are not to be expected."
1,Can't I give it 0 stars? Puh-leese?,"Boy, was this an awful book. I chose to ignore the bad reviews, figuring those people were just grumps anyways, but man I should have listened. Why do so many people give this book a good review? After reading it, I can find no merit in the lies told in the text, and it is clear that the author is just out to make money."
2,"Not great, but not as bad as some might say...","Although it wasn't entirely accurate, it wasn't horrid. The Book of Pherrylt is a fabrication, yes, and some of the chants may be much more recent than listed, but they are still effective. I don't know about the herb section as that isn't in my realm of expertise, but the ritual was questionable. It shouldn't be listed as authentic Druidism, but as modern magic parts of it aren't bad."
1,Fabricated GARBAGE!,"RUN! Run from this book and this author. It is nothing but GARBAGE! Stick with the REAL Druids and scholars: John and Caitlin Matthews, Mara Freeman, Ellen Evert-Hopman, R J Stewart, Peter Berresford-Ellis, Miranda Green, Alexei Kondratiev, Barry Cunliffe, Emma Restall-Orr, Phillip Carr-Gomm, Isaac Bonewitz, Philip Shallcrass, Ron Hutton, Anne Ross, Simon James, Charles Squire, Alwyn & Brinley Rees."
2,Male Positive book on Paganism,"So many books on contemporary Paganism focus on the feminist aspects of Nature Religions. This one, however historically inacurate it may be, presents a very Male positive approach to Pagan Spirituality. I feel that it addresses a need left unacknowledged by the many wonderful books directed at women and girls.That said, the historical inacuracies and the insistance on one-true-way-isms, are points out of favor and, to be honest, I'm not sure that the world really needs more books which favor gender segregated Paganism."
5,The best book for learning calligraphy I have seen.,"I found this book to be very comprehensive, easy to follow and will recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn calligraphy."
1,not the full set there should be two Barbara Stanwyck movies,If this is the second season there should be 2 Barbara Stanwyck show in this series for the year. So I beleive it is lacking in what it is.
5,Abnormal Psychology,The book was in very good condition. It was a basically brand new book which I truly enjoyed because I like to keep my books after I use them for the class. There is not enough detail when it comes to buying a book. I just got really lucky with this book.
2,Not operating properly,"When I received the doll I turned it on and she made about 4 or 5 facial expressions before she said a word. She is not operating properly and since I ordered the doll a month and a half beofre my daughter's birthday, I was unable to return or exchange. I was told to contact the manufacture. I guess the doll was mishandled before it reached me...Be careful."
3,It's not Bridge of Sighs II,"Like a lot of Fans Of A Certain Age, I rejected For Earth Below when it was released in the mid-Seventies. I wanted Bridge of Sighs II. In retrospect, I can appreciate this disc as a bold and rather brave shift away from what had been a very lucrative psychedelic sound, in favor of more straight-ahead R&B. If Bridge of Sighs was Are You Experienced, then For Earth Below was Band of Gypsys -- the replacement of drummer Reg Isidore with a Sly & The Family Stone alumnus, Bill Lordan, brought Trower's sound down to earth as forcefully as Buddy Miles grounded Jimi Hendrix. The disc's biggest problem is the subpar songwriting: only ""Alethea"" rates as a commanding cut. Trower's change of direction would be vindicated with later releases like In City Dreams, but nothing he released after this would have the commercial impact of Bridge of Sighs."
3,Post-Freudian Giovanni,"The trouble with this bleakly modern staging of Don Giovanni isn't that it fails but that it works all too well. Instead of the Faustian Giovanni of traditional productions, whose defiance is so appealing that one almost wishes him a better fate, Gilles Cachemaille portrays a sex-crazed psychopath who unquestionably deserves the psychological hell he's created for himself. Instead of the stock commedia Donna Elvira, we get a hopeless co-dependent. The cocky survivor Leoporello, traditionally a double of Figaro but less lucky in his master, becomes a self-hating neurotic with just a hint of masochistic homoeroticism. Don Ottavio, traditionally a satiric role, in the Glyndebourne production becomes the most stable character, the ""therapist"" for Donna Anna. And so on. All the roles are well conceived in this dark, Bergmanesque psychodrama. It's a good piece of theater!Oh, but what about the music? Unfortunately, it's not well-suited to the action, and perhaps should be replaced."
3,Like-New purchase adventure,"1st - Like-New <ha> refurbished model with a soft modem didn't work on my phone line. Spent 2 hours with webtv tech trying different codes w/o any luck. He suggested a different house. Tried b-n-law's house. On phone with webtv tech 3 hours trying lots of different codes. Finally removed former owner's (seller) phone info and log on data installed on unit. Webtv tech removed it from his location and added mine. Another 30 minutes of different codes and it started working.It works, it works!!! At least the main unit. Have to aim wireless keyboard level with unit. Web eye uncooperative! Even my old web eye doesn't work with this unit.Classic webtv users are in for it. MSNTV doesn't have any manufacturers building new WEBTV units. Users have to rely on used equipment which may or may not be up to standard. Buyer beware!"
1,Diaper Genie is a scam,"I was able to figure out how to work Diaper Genie, but it's a lot of work and it doesn't work well. The device basically attempts to make little dirty diaper sausages. You put the diaper into the bag that has one end tied off, turn the head to slice the bag at the other end and tie that end off.All this happens while your baby is sitting on the changing table or, in the best situation, running around or lying on the floor, and you're futzing with the stupid bags.After just a few days we switched over to Diaper Champ, which uses straight tall kitchen garbage bags and has a rotating top that keeps the basic stink out. It works much more simply and quickly than Diaper Genie."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!,"when we registered, we thought that that genie was the only one out for diaper disposal. since it was all we had heard of, we thought ""of course we have to have it."" what a joke! it does work for the odor factor, but our son in only 2 months and i heard poop doesn't really start to stink until solids are introduced. it is just so incredibly awkward to use. it takes 1 hand to push the button on the top and the other hand to pull the top open. don't forget you have a dirty diaper in one hand, too! we wrap our diapers pretty good and have still gotten poop on the sides a few times. yuck! you have to push the diaper in way farther than you expect, close it and then turn until you hear 2 clicks. it needs a foot peddle or SOMETHING! my husband and i really hat it and think it's a waste. i have a feeling we're just going to stop using it because it's way more of a hassle than the smell of dirty diapers. wish we knew sooner that it really sucked..."
5,Great Item!,"I'm the mom of a 4 month old boy, and I couldn't be happier with the New Diaper Genie. It's not hard to use, and since we only use it for poopy diapers, the refills last. We've only used 2 or 3 refills in 4 months. I think that if you use a diaper system that uses trash bags, you still end up buying more trash bags each month, so what's the difference?"
2,"Maybe new, still needs improved!","Typically, it works alright. However I have problems with the cutting mechanism almost every time I empty it, it will only partially cut through the plastic (and that was on the stage 1). And after I empty it, I re-tie a knot and twist the top and the next time I put a diaper in, it just spins and spins with out actually tying up the diaper."
2,"Okay, but I might get the diaper champ....","This diaper genie works okay, but I really don't want to buy refills for it. I got a ton of diaper genie refills for my baby shower, but now I am running out of them, so I might just invest in the diaper champ since you don't have to buy refills for it.The diaper genie blocks the odor pretty well, but when you open it, it really stinks...I know a friend who owns a diaper champ and it does not stink when you put a diaper in because you never actually OPEN it.Another bad thing about the diaper genie is that you have to shove the diaper in there really far in order to get it in right. You also have to push the diaper in pretty hard. It can get nasty sometimes because no one wants to push on a squishy diaper like that, it's just gross!!Changing the refills also sucks. It's like this big stinky chain of diapers. I hate it.So, overall, the diaper genie is okay...but I think I might just buy the diaper champ because it just seems easier and better."
1,wish I could give this 0 stars,"Do not waste your money on the Diaper Genie. Even the ""new and improved"" Diaper Genie can't compare to the Diaper Champ. The Diaper Champ uses regular size trash bags where the Diaper Genie requires special refills. I can't speak for anyone else, but personally, the idea of having to constantly buy expensive refills for my diaper pail, when we already have trash bags in the house, is nuts.As for the ""smell"" issue. Let's face it - diapers stink. And regardless of brand, ANY diaper pail still needs to be emptied on a regular basis. As for the Diaper Genie vs the Diaper Champ, I have seen no difference in odor control between the two brands - both work pretty well to contain and control odor better than a regular trash barrel, but neither are odor proof."
4,I like it.,"It keeps the stink away and is easy to use. It is hard to figure out at first, but my son is now 6 mos and I have it all mastered, (even the refills)! Personally, I recommend it."
1,Say No to the Diaper Genie,"We have had the diaper genie for 6 months with our first born. The lid (hinges in the back) just recently broke, I would have thought this was a one time thing, but our friends who have used the diaper genie for 6 months as well, had just purchased another diaper genie due to the same reason.Also as stated in previous reviews. The twisting and cutting mechanism on the lid does not always work on the first couple of tries. We will be trying out a different diaper pail."
3,We got one...but took it back...,"We got one (had it on our registry) but then realized after someone purchased it that it was a cheap feeling piece of plastic and we would have to pay $5-$6 per refill (and I think there were like 30 bags in each one?)....so to save money, we took it back, and went to Target. There we got a nice looking, hard,metal trash can (a small one- about knee high) that takes regular trash bags or grocery bags... there is no smelly room because you change it every couple days. We've had it since Jadon was a newborn, and he's 7 1/2 months now. Worked for us :)"
1,It has fallen apart,"The second that I opened this thing over two years ago it was a problem. It was complicated to put together and still after many refills a mystery to reload. The plastic bags never seemed to stay twisted, so the diapers would all be in one big section. I guess I'm lazy but, it just seems to hard. When you have a two year old and a new born diaper disposal should not be so difficult. After my second child was born I bought some refills (which makes me crazy, seems like a waste of money!) and tried to get the thing up and running. Well some small plastic thing fell out (still can't find where it belongs) and the cutting ring is warped and a ragged at the edge. The ring no longer fits. I put stinky diapers in plastic grocery bags and toss them in the trash."
1,NOT WORTH IT!,"I did NOT like the ""new & improved"" Diaper Genie. First the button kept breaking off to open the thing. Second, you have to stick your hand deep in the pail - more than I wanted to for a diaper pail. Third, the cutter rarely worked. I had to use scissors more times. Forth, when I put the refills in, it never started off correctly. Finally, the odor control was aweful. Although, no matter what diaper disposal unit you use, the only way to completely control the odor is to empty it regularly and clean it. I was NOT impressed with this product at all - I would have given it zero stars if it was an option. I ended up going to buy another one, that was cheaper and works a lot better - no fuss at all."
1,I HATE THIS THING!!!,"I bought a diaper genie for my baby, despite numerous people telling me it wasnt worth it.. It was fine at first... My baby is only a month old and im already giving it away! My first complaint is that the first few diapers wont stay wrapped! As soon as i put another diaper in it unravels the first diaper and the second drops down with the first.. IT keeps doing this until the bag is too heavy and wont wrap at all! My second complaint is that the cutter doesnt work! It will cut about an inch or two and then stop and every time i try to do it again it just doesnt work, so i end up cutting it with scissors.. This thing is WAY too much work for a diaper pail! ANd its a pain to get the diaper down in there when trying to hold onto a wriggling baby too. In my opionion its NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL!!!! I wouldnt recommend this to ANYONE!! I bout the diaper champ and it is the greatest pail ever! BUY THE DIAPER CHAMP!"
1,whats the point?,"only specified bags, really messy and I see no point to doing this when you have a garbage can and hopefully you do not leave your garbage for a day or 2 in the house so when you take the garbage out, you take the dirty diapers. Please, I have it, my daughter is 9mths old and ask me how many times have I used it... ask me!!! I'll tell you- NONE! Thank you to the gift bearer, it was a great idea, thought, gesture and surely appreciated but the system sux.."
3,Replacing mine with a diaper champ.,"We've been using the new diaper genie for 5 weeks now. I like it, it works well, definitely contains diaper odor - but I have to go to Babies R Us to get refills today and I can see this becoming very annoying - so instead of refills I am going to buy a diaper champ, which uses regular trash bags. Anyone want my diaper genie? =) The only other problem with the diaper genie is that it is noisy - if I change my son and he goes back to sleep, I can't put the diaper in it until he wakes up. Right now he's on breastmilk, but when he's eating solid food, I won't want to leave those poopie diapers out overnight!"
4,Great Buy!,"If you can't figure out how to use this, you'll be in for a real treat when your kids get older and they want toys that need assembly. This is the simpliest and greatest gift we received. Diapers stink! Diapers that sit in your house for days -REALLY Stink! If you don't empty the diaper pail frequently, you will smell the diapers.As for changing the liner, it isn't difficult either and the linears are available in most major chains including Target!If you use washable diapers - you're whole house stinks unless you do laudry 3 times a day.Most kids are only in diapers for about 2 years - it isn't that long. We have it far easier today than people did years ago. A friend of mine used the original Diaper Genie years ago and loved it. After using the one we have - I must agree -it definately makes a useful gift, purchase, for new parents."
1,Buy the Champ!!!,"I used the Diaper Genie for 15 months and cursed it daily- not as much as my husband though :) The mechanism that cuts the plastic broke after only a month so we had to use scissors instead. The refills are expensive and smell funny. I think they added to the odor problem instead of masking it. Also, the lid was sometimes hard to open. We finally broke down and bought the Champ. My daughter's room doesn't smell like diapers any more! It's so easy to refill with just any plasic bag-trash, grocery or shopping bags work fine. One reviewer stated that she had to clean it regularly because of smearing- (ewww) Just make sure the contents of the diaper is wrapped up tight and it won't be a problem."
1,Not good in the long run,"I received the Diaper Genie as a shower gift. In the beginning, I loved it. There was no diaper smell in the nursery and it was easy to use. However, after each refill the plastic ring would bend a little and make it increasingly difficult to change. I have now had the Diaper Genie for almost fifteen months. The hinge on the back has broken and I can no longer use it with one hand. I am currently searching for a diaper pail that will last through at least one kid in diapers."
1,Not worth it,"This product was a major dissapointment. As far as masking smell, it was alright. But as far as practicality, the last thing I had time to do was make it work. A trash can with a bag and a lid has been so much easier to clean and maintain. Don't waste your money, just take out the trash. With all of the other purchases necessary I wouldn't even consider it."
3,Nice but not neccesary.,"My daughter is 7 months and in a size 3 diaper. Now that she is bigger, you don't get as many diapers into the genie and with the weather being warm, might as well put them in a plastic bag & straight into the outside trash can. It was a nice thing to have when she was younger & it always kept the smell out of her room. If you get it for a gift, great- use it as long as you can. But the money spent for it and the re-fills is better spent on diapers & formula."
2,Should have an expiration Date,"My son is now a year old and this things smells so bad I had to throw it out. It made me gag everytime I went to change it. The first few months it was ok but now about 9-12 months later it stinks. I bleached it out several times, and the smell would not go away. Plus I was having a harder and harder time finding the refills. Which are like $10.00 each. It also doesn't hold very many diapers. Also, if I didn't get the diaper in the clips just right it would fall to the bottom and get messed up."
1,Why???,"I can't say I've used any other brand but the Diaper Genie but I really don't get the concept. It was a pain to use even more of a pain to empty and for what? Why not just toss them in the garbage and bring them outside at the end of the day? (or sooner if you have an especially stinky one) The thought of leaving soiled diapers (or any other trash, food, or heigene item)in a semi sealed container in your house for weeks (or longer) is kinda grose??! I used it with my first child for a few months and her nursery smelled worse then my second child's does without using it. Save your money and pitch the diapers with the rest of your trash."
3,Okay but you need to double wrap diapers once they are eating solids.,I got mine second hand so it was free and when my son was just eating formula it worked great. You have to buy refills but they lasted awhile because we only genied the stinky ones. Now that he is eating normal food we have to wrap the diapers in cheap baggies from the dollar store and then put them in the genie. We have ultimately discovered that these cheap 1.00 bags actually work all by themselves in the garbage. We empy the garbage enough that there isn't any smell. This was convenient to have next the changing table for the first year. Then we got rid of the changing table and just haven't needed it.
1,I HATE this thing!,"Well, I put it on my registry and got it, and I wish I didn't! The handle does not twist the bag, so it DOESN'T lock in the smell. It just doesn't twist. It doesn't cut through the bags, you have to use scissors to do it. The refills are really expensive. And it doesn't have a foot peddle for no hands disposing. My son's room always smells like you know what. And it doesn't hold a lot of diapers. I feel like I'm constantly emptying it, which isn't the simplest procedure. I down right hate it, don't buy it!"
1,complicated and expensive refills,I found that it was more trouble than it was worth to set up the Diaper Genie and do the refills. A garbage can with a tight lid works great and the garbage bags are way cheaper than the diaper genie refills. I change the garbage bag every day anyway and haven't had problems with odor.
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought the diaper genie for my twins and used it for 3 months. My biggest complaint is, that it is hard to open (you often need two hands) and it is incredibly loud. You have to shove the diaper down and the bags really crinkle loudly, then you close the lid, which is heavy and if you are not careful will slam down. Then you turn the dial, which makes loud clicking sounds. My babies startle every single time. I just purchased the Decor plus diaper pail - so much better. It uses a similar cartridge system for the bags AND you can get them biodegradable now, so if you are using biodegradable diapers it makes all the more sense. Plus, once you are done with diapers, you can use this as a regular trash can, whereas the genie becomes useless."
1,Save your money!,"My husband and I bought the ""new and improved"" Diaper Genie for our son recently, and I have to say, if this is new and improved, I would hate to see what the original was like. Not only was the refill extremely difficult to install- and very pricey-the lid broke off of its hinges in a matter of days. Also, the plastic protector piece broke off the inside of the lid exposing a sharp razor on the inside of the lid, which of course my son found and cut his finger on. This is a terrible product and we were very dissapointed. It did not stand up to normal everyday wear and tear. I am going to go out and buy a diaper champ today. It can't be any worse! I would absolutely advise against buying this product. It is not worth the money!"
2,Highly over rated product,This product has been difficult to use from day one. The Diaper Genie was hard to work every time we tried to cut the bag to dispose of the diapers. I also thought the bagging system was really wasteful and another extra expense. To top it off it finally broke completly after only 5 months of use. We are getting ready to purchase the diaper champ I sure hope it works better than this!
4,A very informative resource,"This book shows in very good scientific detail the harm that is caused by meth. I am very impressed by the explanations, the risk factors, and the way Dr. Holley showed how serious the meth problem really is.I am absolutely shocked at how serious meth abuse has hurt this country. The best analogy I have is that methamphetamines are to drugs what AIDS is to STD's. STD's and drugs are bad, no getting around it, but as serious as AIDS is, meth is just as horrible. It is a death sentence, and there's no such thing as a safe amount. It causes permanent, irreversible damage to the user, and Dr. Holley minces no words in explaining it."
4,Juke Joint Jam,"When the plot takes the viewer away from the Church, the misnomered nightclub in this fictional Georgia town, the proceedings include a melancholy hodgepodge of gangsters, illegal booze, and fractured relationships. But the song & dance numbers, especially in the early going, are divine."
1,Just wild and confusing is all I can say,I expected a lot more from this movie. I did not enjoy it at all. It seemed very messy for a musical.
1,Could've Been a Great Movie About Ambition,"This movie had the potential of being a real eye opener for many people, but they reuined it with all the sex and cursing, two very unnecessary evils when trying to get your point across. I don't recommend it for anyone."
1,TERRIBLE,James Marsden is the worst actor I've ever seen. This movie is terrible. Do NOT buy or rent this drivel. I can't even call it predicable. It is so incoherent and the whole thing seems to be shrouded in an(accidental) WHO GIVES A DAMN attitude. Such a boring film. The DVD transfer isn't really so hot either.
4,Good teen flick,I loved this movie when I saw it as a teen that's why I wanted to buy it and relive the memories. Still like it!
2,Serious Waste of Money!,"This movie was B-O-R-I-N-G!Don't get me wrong, I think Katie Holmes is DA BOMB but seeing her in this movie was well, disturbing! This movie barely had a story to it plus it was poorly produced! If you just want to see Katie Holmes do yourself a favor and just go rent it! At least you'll be able to get rid of it! (My copy of Disturbing Behavior is under the bed, collecting dust)"
3,Why I probably liked this movie,"My sister is a English teacher at a college, and she says the reason why I like this movie is, because Katie Holmes is in it. I almost cried at the conclusion of the movie, because it is both happy & sad plus the music at the end."
1,JAMES MARSDEN POOR ACTING,"This is a movie that could have made it, boxoffice was very very low. James marsden doesn't come across,and pulls the entire production down. MGM could have cast certainly a better proven actor in the part played by james marsden."
3,"Alternate Ending, hopeful Sequel","In all honesty, I enjoyed this movie; in no way was this the best movie of my life, but it had a charm to it.For the script they were given, I believe the actors did an amazing job in performance.What would have made it better is if they had taken the alternate ending, and allowed you to view that ending in the movie instead along with the other cut features that actually in some places would have made the movie make a lot more sense.I understand why they never did, but I think if they had the chance, I would think I sequel would possibly be amazing as long as they do it correctly (control the plot, do not rush the film, and make sure the right ending is in the movie)."
2,There's One Reason To Spend Your Time Watching This,"...her name is Katie Holmes. Breathtakingly beautiful as ever, the makers of 'Disturbing Behavior' must have thrown her in to at least get SOMEthing out of their film. 'Cause there's not much of a story. Or rather, we've seen it all before.'Disturbing Behavior' is more original than 'The Skulls', on the level of 'The Faculty', but contains, what, one scary scene. 'Scary' is maybe too strong a word.But go ahead, rent it on a lazy afternoon, and enjoy Katie Holmes' gorgeousness. But do not expect much more from the film."
1,Original story was changed,The pro-Socialist propaganda in the movie ruined it for me.The film is loaded with Liberal White Guilt and I noticed this especially when Gulliver visits the one kingdom where they have a Black Queen and most of the citizens there are also Black. They were portrayed as the only group of people who are living the right way and this is highly offensive.I don't think a movie based on an 18th century novel should have modern race propaganda in it.
5,awesome,I recommend this movie to anyone who likes adventure and comedy. Ted danson did a fabulous job.
3,Winsome wood,The design is too wobbly because the lets do not have cross pieces for better opposing support. It would serve okay as a stationary table as long as weight was not being shifted on it too much or moved around or if not a lot of weight is put on it but you would not want to use this as table where heavy things were being moved on and off it on a regular basis.
4,"thank you, Jessica","This movie's very good, but could have been better. Fortunately, there is Jessica Lange because the lovely Gwyneth Paltrow isn't half convincing at all for this part. Still is a good thriller to watch because Jessica's taking it away."
4,A stunning beautiful movie,This movie has a beautiful storyline. Gwyneth is fabulous and looks great and her acting is stunning. Very attractive. Jessica lange is fabulous. I like when they meet for the first time and catches gwinnie in the nude. Cute butt! The actor who plays her husband is good too. This is a movie that people can watch from time to time about a loving couple and many exciting and entertaining surpises. Definitely an underrated movie.
5,Beginners to intermediate sewers guide,"This book is all about how to get the best out of your sewing machine, and shows all the attachments, presser feet, and needles which can be used with the machines. For the beginner, it will also tell you what to look for when buying a sewing machine. It also comes with some very useful sewing tips. I recommend this book for people who love to sew and who loves to experiment with their sewing machines. I am very happy with this purchase. An attractive book to read!"
5,Great Book,This is a most informative outline to accomplish fine sewing. The instructions are easy to understand therefore creating exquisite projects is made easy.
1,Not the serial,If you are a true serial fanatic you won't like this DVD. It's the feature version. I was surprised because there is a full 12 chapter VHS version.
4,"okay, but not as good as Marengo Films previous version","Marengo Films decided to add back in the chapter stops to this latest version of 'Shadow Of The Eagle', and honestly, I have no idea why. What was a unique move on their part by eliminating the repetitive summaries between each chapter, is now back again...adding an unnecessary 40 minutes more to the viewing time. I'm glad I still have the original version they put out, as this version is just like every other one out there on the market. It's a shame they never put out 'The Hurricane Express' and 'The Three Musketeers' serials without the summary chapters as well. The first version of Marengo Films 'Eagle' is the one that really soars!"
1,Not received it yet,"It has been almost a month since I ordered this product and have not received it yet. I was given a notice a few days later that it was backordered and that was fine, but I have received no word since."
1,Simply doesn't work,"I bought this printer for my wife. After unwrapping and installing it to the TV we were able to print maybe 10 pictures and then it continuously asked to put paper in the tray even when it already had it. Returned it to the store and got a replacement. After a few prints, I had the same problem. I finally gave up on it. Felt like I threw $100 to the trash."
3,Still not anamorphic,"This is a great movie, but this new version, with the digital copy, is still not anamorphic. Amazing"
2,video did not even fill the whole screen!,"I wish I had known that the video would not even fill up the screen all the way across. If it's widescreen, I expect to see the black band at the top and bottom section of the picture, but the picture would at least go all the way across. This only was a small rectangle in the middle of the screen! We don't have a giant screen (only 42""), but I would expect to see a larger actual picture than what we have. I would order it in blu-ray if that would solve the problem, but I don't want to spend another $8 and have the same result. It didn't give any option for full screen, so I guess I'm stuck with it. Not worth the hassle to return it with postage since it was only $4.50 to start with."
1,total garbage,"I served on board an ssbn as a sonar tech. everything about this movie is wrong from the basic plot to having a dog onboard.not one thing in this insulting movie is based in reality.the characters are weak-minded cowards who would never be allowed on a sub.everyone involved with this movie owe the navy an apology.there is no entertainment here and the controversy generated by thier situation is sheer lunacy.do not spend your hard earned money on this crap,they don't deserve it."
4,Watch Hackman's Acting Closely Here,"I love to watch submarine movies so I naturally enjoyed this one. But it's the same old story--a trigger-happy, mentally unstable skipper (Gene Hackman) and a loyal, level-headed, sensible executive officer who takes a lot of guff and abuse from the boss man without turning the least bit mean himself. Glenn Ford and Ernie Borgnine played those roles in Torpedo Run and Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster did it too. As did countless others for that matter. There's the usual disasters on board, menacing torpedos being shot at them from an enemy sub, the treat of nuclear war, a mutiny, guys smoking like chimneys--how do they get away with smoking on a nuclear submarine anyhow? But it's great entertainment and I'll view this little beauty at least once a year probably. Hackman's facial expressions are wonderful! Watch how he turns instantly from a grinning, apparently congenial chuckle to a sinister glare. I'd have given him an academy award for this performance."
2,Only old-fashioned projects,"I was very disappointed when I first opened this book. The projects are so old-fashioned, I hardly found a couple of nice designs. If you want to equip your home with things that look 100 years old, you should buy this book - but I do not like this style. This might be popular in the US, but not here in Europe. It is mentioned in the description of the book that the designs are classic, but I expected something else."
5,This book rocks!,"This book has so many projects in it that some are bound to interest you. The problem with books that feature, say 25 projects, is that if you find 10% of them interesting you get 2-3 projects out of the book. This has 150 projects. If you find 10% of them interesting then you walk away with clear instructions and pretty detailed plans for 15 projects. This book is well written and includes sections on finishing and material selection. I own many ""project"" books. This book outshines them all by a wide margin. Joinery is pretty basic and the projects run from beginner to intermediate, with most of them being the former. One point that I feel compelled to mention, however, is that most projects in this book require a machine (or hand tool) that will cut curves. Just buy it!"
4,A good collection projects for a beginner to intermediate wood worker.,My wife gave me this book as a surprise gift. I generally agree with most of the other reviews concerning the scope and complexity of the projects in this book. There are a lot of projects and not too many are difficult for an advanced beginner. Most of the projects can be completed with only hand tools. Several projects do require a lathe.I really would like to give this book 4.5 stars... :)
3,good little stamper,"The stamper works as claimed.Pros: There's a way to stop the mechanism in the middle to make it easier to adjust the date.There's even an adjustment, not documented, to change the relation between the date lettersand the customized letters so they both stamp with the same intensity.Con: The stamp pad itself gets indented by the letters, so that when one changes the date,some portion of the new symbols are left high-and-dry without getting ink. One way of dealingwith this is to change the date symbols the night before you need it."
5,Multisync 95 is Awesome,Great color depth and amazing graphics for the price. Highly recommended for all-purpose use.
4,Very peaceful,"If you like all piano and want something that is very subtly Christmas-like, this is the cd for you. I got it originally because I have another of Kurt Bestor's cd's - Noel - which I love, and expected this one to be similar in mixing renaissance-type instrumentals with occasional choral singing. I play that one to death, and it really puts me in a nice, energized Christmas mood. So, based on that, I was disappointed with Silent Night, BUT, I'm a massage therapist and found it to be perfect to play as background music for my clients during their sessions. It's very peaceful and tranquil, doesn't scream Christmas, and is perfect for quiet moments of reflection and meditation. My clients didn't notice right away that it was Christmas music, but really enjoyed it once they did."
5,"A collection of dancer's scriptures, to be read and danced..","Lots of nice reading here...a celebration of dance by those and for those who love to dance. Some of my favorites from the book: "" If we think, feel, and move, we can dance. "" - Margaret N. H'Doubler ""It is what I've always wanted to do - to show the laughing, the fun, the appetite, all through dance."" -Martha Graham "" I don't want people who want to dance, I want people who have to dance."" -George Balanchine"
2,Say What....?,"....the ultimo movie about a bungled heist job and the crooks are holed out somewheres is....Reservior Dogs. This has great actors in it...I enjoyed seeing, f'instance, Dame Dunaway...but, she, Sinise, Dillon, Mantegna, and perpetual co-lister Faison had a poor dialog to work with. Imagine if QT had written it. Or, my favorite tough guy screenwriter, David Mamet. Fortunately though, Spacey will have something to build on develop a director's repertoire..."
3,Pretty good flick,Good Dillon pick. There was a lot of fights and double crosses. Good to watch if you are bored or tired. It's plot is very original and suspenseful. The only problem is that it lasts too long. They good have made it about a half hour shorter.
1,Where does one begin?,"Bad, bad, bad. Nothing is good about this film. Nothing. The performances are overblown and director Spacey, such a talented actor, here directs every moment to be a major one, allowing nothing to just happen. Such talent is wasted here."
1,Avoid,"DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. Sounds good on paper but throughout the whole film, NOTHING HAPPENS. Unfortunately, I kept waiting for the payoff. Believe me, there isn't one."
5,Finally...pattern mittens for the intermediate level knitter,"Finally, a patterned method mitten technique for the pattern-challenged! I attempted complex patterned mittens before, but couldn't figure out how to follow patterns when other knitting stuff such as gussets and other increases and decreases were happening. And this author gives a technique for using bands of plain color in between the mitten and the thumb that allow you to start the pattern fresh at the gusset. This way, you're not reading two pattern charts at once (which I find very confusing).Also, this book gives detailed instructions on how to follow purely charted patterns for mittens, when other charted pattern books just left me to fend on my own.This is the best mitten book I have. Now I can attempt those pattern mittens I saw in Tasha Tudor's Heirloom Crafts book. :-)"
5,Truth is stranger than fiction....,"I am always hearing about biogaphies that dispel the myths. What most people don't understand is that extraordinary people usually end up in extraordinary situations. I always laugh when biographers like to dispel the myths. Why? Were you there? Also there are going to be others who always love to tear down those that are great to make them seem more human. I believe these people are just tearing them down to feel beter about there own usless existence. This book gives you a great picture of a great warrior. Myths and facts included. Granted it is not as in-depth as some may like, but there are other biographies that will do the job for you. This book is very entertaining, well written and paints a great picture of one of the greatest warriors ever to walk the earth. Lighten up people and let some legends stay as they are. They inspire us to be better than what we are! Good night Chesty Puller, where ever you are!"
5,"Perfecto, chorizo palacios de toda la vida","Es el chorizo palacios español verdadero.Compré 10 paquetes y llegaron bien y a tiempo, ya he comprado un par de veces el chorizo por aquí."
4,Very Good Chorizo,"Received the chorizo in a timely manner, it was well packaged. The diameter of the sausage was much less than I imagined. My son and I liked the taste. The vendor seems very conscientious to please his customers."
5,Eddie Palmieri & Co. - hot to the max,"This is definitely one of my favorite Palmieri albums! It adds a unique dimension to other musical offerings since the typically deprived prison audience (clearly heard in background) contribute to this LIVE recording. Eddie & Co. pack a collective musical ""punch"" in this hot, hot, album!"
5,Live in Sing Sing,Desde adentro para los de afuera. Excelente interepretacion de Charlie y Eddie. Musica como de viajar
5,Glad to Find,"I am so glad to find ""Christmas with Charles Osgood"" in CD form. I had two copies of the cassette, but I no longer have cassette playing ability in my car. I love the narration, and the music of course is outstanding being the Mormon Tabernacle Choir."
2,Softcover at Hardcover Price,"We were very dissapointed to discover the book included with this set is softbound, not hardcover as the product desription states. We bought the set specifically because we needed a durable hardbound book, but basicaly ended up just paying 12 dollars extra for a softcover with a doll we didn't really want which quickly fell apart. We ended up returning the set for a refund."
4,Patjo@dcr.net,"The book arrived wrapped in plastic, but it did not include the paper jacket as shown in the picture. However, the book did appear new and was a suitable gift for a medical school graduate."
3,"So-so, some good but lacks depth","There is much that's good about this novel, but there is no shading to the world around the main character, Nine, and her teacher. I like how he BECOMES her world, and her reactions are realistic, especially how much her world really is rocked by the relationship. But the story is too linear and one-dimensional. The characters around her, like her male best friend, are stock. Also their conversaionts are unrealistic. I can believe that she is smart for her age. I cant buy that Mr. Mann is as immature as he is, without realistic background. He never acts older than she is, except that he listened to eightie's punk rock. Of course, I am older than teen readers (I am 24) but I can still read and enjoy some older teen liteature. I just need to see more of a surrounding story, but I guess things have to be simpler for younger kids."
5,Tango review,I think this is about the most sensuous book of tango photography ever. I have two of them.
5,THIS FILM IS A GREAT ENTERTAINMENT!,"What is the problem with this movie? Why do people hate it so much? I believe that after ""Clueless"", Alicia Silverstone fans expect her to be some cute little smiley high school girl. Look, this movie is very UNDER RATED! First of all, the plot is engrossing and kept my attention. The script is actually quite good and well executed by the cast. And, oh, that Chrisopher Walken... the perfect touch as uncle Ray! I honestly DO NOT get it? Why do so many folks loathe this film? At least one movie lover gave EXCESS BAGGAGE it's due. Sun-Times Roger Ebert gave it THREE stars out of four! C'mon people WAKE UP! Snap out of it!!!"
1,"correction .1 star, sorry","This is the lamest of the lame. Alicia Silverstone can't act, sorry to say she never could. It totally lacks a plot, writing, talent, anything else you can think of. This is a horrible attempt at entertainment. I cannot reccomend this ""movie."""
3,"Not bad, but not that great","Colin Brake's first Doctor Who novel is not a resounding success. The prose is a bit laboured, the Doctor's first meeting with Fitz in 100 years (as far as the Doctor is concerned) is rather anticlimactic and the characters are rather wooden.The reason this book gets three stars, though, is Anji. Her character is a breath of fresh air after the companionless books that have just passed. Brake goes into a lot of detail about her and we really get to know her. Her relationship with her boyfriend is real (I've known people like him).Escape Velocity brings the Caught on Earth arc to a conclusion. It's not necessarily a satisfying one, but it does provide a good jumping off point for the next series of adventures (even down to the menacing shadow on the TARDIS door at the end of the book)."
2,One for the Band..not fans!,"This release is obviously for the band's egos not for the fans. Does anyone want to heat Ross, Neal, Jonathon and Dean sing? Think of the Yankees benching Randy Johnson and piching the 1st, 2nd, 3rd baseman and shortstop. The fans are cheated. I'm not paying for that. Enough said."
2,No Steve Perry! It's not Journey,"I'm not bashing the current line-up, but Steve Perry was the voice of Journey. I wish the ""new"" line-up continued success, but I'd give my eye-teeth to see Steve Perry perform with Journey again."
2,One of the Worst War Movies Ever,"The other customers are WAY too kind in their reviews of this turkey. The multitude of inaccuracies and exaggerations in this movie might be forgiven if they weren't further compounded by more drawbacks: wooden, cliched characters (Henry Fonda's); worn-out storylines (James MacAruthur's); corny dialogue . . . For the incredible all-star cast, the acting is, well, OVERacting.I liked this thing as a kid but it's almost unwatchable for me now. It looks even worse compared to more modern productions, especially Saving Priate Ryan.For a far more realistic, gripping, and intelligent film on the Battle of the Bulge, watch the 1949 classic, Battleground. One of the most underrated war films ever."
2,"Action-packed, but lacking historic fact","If you want action, this movie has it. Sherman tanks (M24 Chafees) go up against the mightier German Tigers (M47 Pattons)during the December 1944 Ardennes Offensive. Filmed near Segovia, Spain in March 1965 (Spain was a popular and economic venue for filmakers in the 1960's, until they discovered Yugoslavia), the film lacks the authenticity of Belgian or Luxembourgian terrain. The characters are stereotyped and the script is loaded with cliches. Still, the movie is a decent attempt by director Ken Annakin to surpass THE LONGEST DAY by use of color, spectacular battle sequences, musical soundtrack, and focus on a handful of characters instead of an endless all-star cast. Unfortunately, the full original cut of THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE has yet to become available VHS or DVD. Approximately 20 minutes of the theatrical film is still missing from the re-release of the video."
3,Good Action But Limited Relevance,"This movie, which I first saw as a [...], is only tangentially relevant to the actual Battle of the Bulge. The movie dwells on the seige of Ambleve and the capture of a fuel depot. There is nothing about the main part of the battle--the seige of Bastogne, its relief, and the ensuing behind-the-lines cutoff of the German advance (the ""bulge""). Focus on Bastogne would have made for much more compelling action and relevance to the actual battle."
1,Battle of the Bulge,"One of the worst of all the World War 2 films. Poorly acted and very historically inacurate even for Hollywood standards. SKIP this turkey and check out a much more powerful film on the famous battle.......""Battleground"""
3,Slightly flawed recount,"Eventhough I understand that this movie is not an exact retelling of the story of the Battle of the Bulge, It was still not close to accurate. The biggest flaw was using 1960s American armor to represent WWII German armor. Aside from that was the lack of Patton's rescue and so on.While I liked the movie, I wish it was more realistic."
1,Complete Fiction,This movie is Hollywood at its worst. The movie is loaded with historical inaccuracies and is down right insulting to veterans who fought in this battle - on BOTH sides. I remember reading about the reviews of several german generals who actually fought in the battle. They found the movie to be a gross parity of history.
3,"Battle Of The Bulge, Blu Ray - The entire movie is fogged","There had been others commenting on the ""fogged picture"". I believe the whole movie is fogged, may be due to light leaking on the camera during filming. Go to the ""train in tunnel scene"" on time line 1:37 and you can see clearly what seem like fogging on both side of the picture, more so on the left side. The amount of fogging that you see depends on the scene at the time. Scenes with high contrase or brightness tend to hide the fogging.I also have the 2005 dvd version of the Bulge and it has the same fogging problem. I believe the problem is with the original master. So is there a good copy of the Bulge where a good Blu Ray can be produced? If not, can present computer technology clean up the fogging?I enjoy the movie and the Blu Ray clearity. I am giving a 5 star rating for that. The 3 star is because of the fogging."
4,An Audiophile Viewer,Robert Shaw's performance was superb. His act and face was very close to the panzer commander Sepp Dietrich. The only pity was that the film producer did not use Tiger Tanks which has lost its accuracy. Hope a new reissue of film to be released with the latest technology soon. As good as directed by Steven Spielberg ??
3,Armchair Historians,"Yes, the movie needs to be Re-released UNCUT from Original Film!In DVD format! The BASIC premises of the movie are accurate!!Everybody who writes reviews thinks they're an Historian...IT'S HOLLYWOOD DRAMA, NOT INTENDED TO BE A DOCUMENTARY!The Basic history is correct: The Germans were excellentwarriors in the face of great odds against them; German panzer crews esp. in Tigers were elite troops,had a special Espirit de Corp, there are only a handful of the legendary Tigers left and they could make mince meat of ANY allied tanks; they were vulnurable to their support systems;they were in desperate need of fuel; they did abandon, but usually destroyed their own tanks,.. They (the editors) REALLY BUTCHERED this movie!!! JERKS... Censorship is alive and well in free? America"
3,"Great Movie, but why is it cut?","Don't understand why the German part is always cut out from this movie, where Robert Shaw is being briefed by the General and ends up seeing his tanks and Shaw saying ""It can be done!"". I truly hope when the DVD comes out that it will include EVERYTHING that was in the original. I want to see ALL of it (seems weird how they cut that part out in every video I've seen). Tends to lessen the drama."
3,But will there ever be a Soundtrack?,I enjoyed the original release and would hope the DVD (if there ever is one) is unedited. My favorite part of this movie is when the Germans sing Panzerwagen Lied which is also the music played during the opening titles. I've been looking for the soundtrack since it came out in 1965 and have yet to find it. It existed at one time on LP. Hopefully some day there will be a CD that includes both versions of Panzerwagen Lied.
1,"If you like historical war movies, pass on this!","The movie had to be shot and in the theater in 8 months, and it shows. I had not seen it since I was a kid; what a shock. I never realized how bad it was. How did they get Fonda, Savalas, and Bronson to sign on to this? Ryan? Lord, the cowboy actor never took his gloves off!! And when he called for ""Plan A"", I about fell out of my chair. The artillery train scence was obviously shot in Spain, and didn't have a thing to do with the plot. Regardless of what the producer said about ""scouring Europe for WWII equipment for the movie"", they didn't. The tanks are all modern American tanks with German markings. The main tank battle scene was shot in a training area in the USA by the looks of it. There is not an ""Ardennes"" tree in sight!! Save your money!!! The only neat thing in the movie was the Panzerlied song. I went to Youtube and downloaded it after watching the movie."
1,Typical tripe from Hollywood,"I recently had the honor to attend a reunion of certain veterans of the Battle of the Bulge. After talking to some of them and actually doing some READING on the subject, I feel insulted to have been charged admission to this one when I saw it as a kid in 1966 or so. Charles Bronson did a decent job of playing an American Major captured by the Germans, but the ""Fuel Dump"" scene where ""Hessler"", a very loose composite of Jurgen Pieper and certain other German officers, gets roasted by a rolling fuel drum is pure (...), and it misrepresents the scale of the battle. It wasn't just a little shootout over some gas, as the movie would have you believe. Throw in a wooden performance from Henry Fonda and you've got a grade C production from Hollywood. Unfortunately typical, and insulting as hell to the guys who really WERE out east of Bastogne in December of '44."
5,Great Tape!!,It covered the battle and the people who fought one of the Greatest battles in Europe theater. Lots of stars in an epic movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,A most excellent alternate world framed by the usual human v,"No matter how many miles in empty space you go, if humans (or humanoid) creatures are found, Jack Vance can create a new world so real you'd swear he had been there. This series, of which this work is but a fragment, chronicles the growth of young Kirth Gerson and his quest for justice after losing all his family to the fabled monsters, the 'Demon Princes'--are they real? And is there life after revenge? An incredible journey into the human condition, by a true master of fantasy and science fiction, Mr. Jack Vance."
5,Boy's dream,It's just what my son wanted. Now he is cutting everything. So far nothing that shouldn't be cut!
2,NOT real enamel!,"This is listed as ""enamel"". Well, it isn't. It's some sort of plastic coating on the inner ring. Real enamel is glass, and it's quite durable. I washed my hands with this ring on - just regular soap - and it took the gloss off the ring. Pathetic! I should have known better than to pay this much! I won't be fooled again...I hope."
1,IT SUCKS,"This is a piece of junk. I bought it becuase it seemed like a good deal. I got it and everything worked fine at first , the load times were a little slow. Then after about a month and a half it wouldn't play any discs anymore. And I hardly used it because I was just starting up my collection. Now ... won't take it back because it broke down after the 30 day time limit so I have to try and deal with the warranty company. Steer clear of this product. I'd suggest investing the money in a decent player, it may cost a little more but chances are it won't break down like this one has for me."
2,VERY SLOW,Well I have to say you get what you pay for. I own 2 other DVD players and i thought I'd buy this one for my kitchen. My 300 disc DVD player loads faster than this one. The picture does come in pretty good though. if you want an inexpensive DVD player and you dont mind wasiting then this one is the one for you. If it was my first and only DVD player I would think it was fast.
5,Great and affordable!,This wedge works great for my son and was a good price in comparison to many others on the market. It really helps with his posture when sitting. Seems to be good quality and we've had no problems with it so far.
4,Are CLothes Modern?,The service was prompt and the book exactly as described (slightly used). It arrived in less than a week and I was pleased with the purchase.
5,High Quality Sound,"Pros:- Cool, customizable and catchy design- Strong, clear sound- Very lightweight and comfortable (louder than most other headphones)- Great value- Sony brand name- New, more flexible type of wire (feels almost like a very thin strand of yarn)Cons:- Wire is too long and gets tangled too easily- Feels ""loose"" on your ears, almost as if its about to fall off- I suspect that the sound bleeds easily since it doesnt fit very tightly against your ear and doesn't have very much padding."
5,SUPERMAN IV,"Good Movie , But Not As Good As 1 And 2 , Still Christopher Reeve Became Superman To A Whole New Generation Of Kids , And The Man Was A Fine And Very Talented Actor , God Rest His Soul , He Made A Whole New Generation , "" LOOK!, UP THERE IN THE SKY !! IT's SUPERMAN!!!....."
3,Not as bad as you remember,"Looking back, now that Chris Reeve is no longer with us (soon to be joined, sadly, by his lovely Dana), it was easy to be cynical. The first two Superman films were perfect. After the stunning disappointment of Superman 3, people were a bit wary about giving their trust to a new Superman film.I'll be the first to admit that Superman 4 is nowhere near as good as the first two, but it does have a powerful message about nuclear disarmament and world peace, a cause which Chris Reeve threw himself into wholeheartedly.So before dismissing the film completely, remember the life and dream of Chris Reeve, and continue the elusive quest for peace!"
4,my favorite Superman movie,After hearing the news of Christopher Reeve passing I popped my copy of Superman IV in to the machine and hit play. I love this movie flaws and all. The idea of Superman dealing with the Cold War is a great one and the cast is excellent. The problem is in the editing and cheap FX. I agree with the reviewers who would like to see the missing 35 minutes inserted into the film again. The owners of this film should put the footage back and somebody should fix up the FX and put out a special edition box set of the Superman movies. I'd even sit through Superman 3 again if it was in such a box set with quality extras. Superman IV needs to recieve the quality treatment it never got. It's one of Reeve's best turns as the Man of Steel (although he was always great in the role). Put IV together right this time and improve the FX a little and release it on DVD somebody!
4,this movie desrvses another chance,I say Superman IV need another chance because most of the plot was cut from this movie.So give it another chance.
2,...a sad day for superman...,"...i gave 2 stars only because of Mr. Reeves great stance on peace and lives of everyone...but S 4 was just awfull....part of the movie when nuclear man flies off with Mz.Hemmingway , he takes her beyond Earth's atmosphere and she is still kicking and screaming(even an idiot would know that a person would die so far up into the atmosphere let alone in space w/ out a space suit)...that sums up this movie(if i get the set of 4 i'll sell or trade in S 4..."
1,Simply Horrible,"This movie was simply horrible. This one and Superman III. When you think Superman, one of the things you think of is the romance between him and Lois Lane,which is played out in the 2nd movie.The problem isn't really bad acting in this movie; it was mor like bad writing. It's such a shame because the first two Superman movies are classics. Watching the 3rd and the 4th movie almost make you never want to watch the first two again. My advice would be don't waste your money on this movie its not worth it. Or if you REALLY want to see this movie rent it."
2,"Still waiting for the ""Director's Cut""...","C'mon folks, where is the rest of this flic? This 90 minutes version seems more like an extended episode of Smallville, but not as good. I can accept the far-fetched plot points, pushing the moon, etc, (this is based on comic books not reality) but this badly edited disaster couldn't be saved, even by Super Christopher Reeves."
2,Superman IV,"Well, I happen to own all four Superman films on DVD. I must say that it would appear that with each following film the production became weaker and weaker... Although I do have an imagination, and I like all four films, the last installment was done by 'Cannon' films, which in large was the king of the ""B"" rated trash of the 1980s... Why on earth Christopher Reeve would allow this to happen is beyond me. Anyway, part 4 is barely 90 minutes long and its overall budget had to be fairly cheap... As for the cast, well, Gene Hackman is a great actor, but in this movie his acting talents are truly wasted. As for Jon Cryer, he was terrible... Personally, the script had potential, but it really needed to be worked out better....MR.BILL"
2,Superman IV: The Quest for Quality,"The quest for quality should be the title of this mediocre sequel. It's straight out of a bad comic book plot and belongs in the bargain bin at your local video store. It's sad that the franchise has not learned it's lesson from their last failure, Superman 3. Instead of producing a human and believable picture, the film shoots strictly for the kiddies with the lamest villain yet- Nuclear Man (don't even ask about Lex Luther's nephew and his reject knight rider car). The film would be a total washout if not for the heartfelt performances of the series' veterans including Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, and Gene Hackman (as the diabolical Lex Luther). Their noble effort can't save this horribly contrived film. It's sad that this is the last Christopher Reeve/Superman movie that we will see."
1,Awful. Simply...awful.,You would be better off to watch two hours of someone clipping their toenails than to lay down money for this stinking excuse for entertainment. Get a load of the special effects -- hoo ha! I've seen better in 50's sci-fi movies. You won't believe a man can fly after sitting through this Super-mistake. Even Christopher Reeve distances himself from this in interviews.
3,"Not great, but WAY better then # 3.","This movie, although it certainly has it's flaws, is a vast improvement over ""Superman 3"". Maybe because it didn't rely too much on comedy? Maybe because thay returned Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor? Maybe, but though both were wise decisions, the fact remains that this still isn't a masterpiece. Superman is back, and he's on a mission to rid the earth of nuclear weapons in an attempt to cease all threats of nuclear war. But Lex Luthor has escaped from prison and isn't going to let Superman take away hi main source of money! So, he steals a strand of hair from the museum and mixes his DNA with a nuclear missle, and when it hits the sun, POOF! Nuclear Man is born! The battle between him and Superman is somewhat poorly directed, if you look at the superb fighting sequences in ""Superman 2"", but how Superman eventually destroys him is clever. Overall, this is worth watching, and I can't understand why all the review books gave this movie such bad reviews!"
2,"SILLY, SHODDY AND UNNECESSARY! 1 3/4 STARS!","'SUPERMAN IV THE QUEST FOR PEACE' is entertaining on a pure camp level. The film is bad, the FX run from good to laughable(flying wires clearly visible)and some truly stupid decisions. I don't know what they paid Hackman to be in this unnecessary retread, but I hope he had fun spending the money. Everything in this film has a ""been there done that"" feel to it. The film is the shortest one in the series by at least 30 minutes but, I found myself dozing off a few time only to awaken with Mariel Hemingway breathing in outer space! LOL! It's sort of fun to watch if you know what to expect. I have heard there is a longer version.......I hope not! ....and I hope Spider-Man 4 doesn't come out this bad! I rated it 1 3/4 stars for a good laugh."
2,It would have been better had the cuts been kept,"What I said in the title says it all. I would rather see this in a edition where all of the cut scenes are put back into the film in their proper order. About the only thing good about this is Reeve as Superman. Although the film itself is not as good as it should have been, he was still endearing."
1,SuperBomb - The Quest for More Money - Half Star,Amazon should really seriously consider the ability to give half stars because this one needs it.Nuclear man - created from Superman's DNA yet he has Lex Luthor's voice and all the intelligence of a crab? What was John Cryer doing in this film? Chris Reeve has writing credit here and considering he didn't want to be labeled the S-guy forever I think he tried to kill the franchise. Golan-Globus should be ashamed. Do what I do buy the first two films and pretend III and IV don't exist. That's what they're doing for Superman Returns!
2,"Superdrupper-man,Sequel No.4 is A Blooper!","Agree with Leonard Maltin's film review on the Quest For Peace,story and regular cast are good as usual they give heart to a soul-ness production so thumbs up for a timeley-nuclear-disarmenment-theme and Chris Reeve & Margo Kidder for the key performances,shame Gene Hackman's terriffic Luthor is dropped on the cutting-room floor. SPFX is a major let-down as is the more than half-hour edited from this film, Fun for the little-kid's though comic-book violence,my small nephews like it, as a Supe's fan I wish only for a restored version of this heavily-edited movie. For Supe's excellence seek out Superman I & II ONLY!"
3,Some bright young talents,"True, most of these stories are pretty terrible: incoherent, recycled modern fiction. But the book is saved by its few good stories, Davy Rothbart's in particular. He's brave enough to take on a rarely-heard voice -- that of a prison inmate -- and honest enough to pull it off. Kudos."
1,Did a deadline influence this book?,"This book has fifteen stories. Among those fifteen, one ending has yet to be found. The stories have no sense of finality. Some of the stories were just plain awful, whereas some could have been salvaged if the authors had wrapped things up and given the story a true ending.The best part of this book was the introduction by Stephen Chbosky, the author of The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Sadly, the introduction only lasts three pages, leaving about one hundred and fifty more to wade through. I wouldn't even recommend this book to an enemy, let alone a friend."
2,This is no perks...,"I bought this book thinking there would be something remotely reminiscent of Stephen's book ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower."" However, this is not. From stories of killing someone on the expressway for no reason to same-sex-sex, within these pages is absolute randomness. I enjoyed one of the many stores in this book. Now because I understand some people like it for their own reasons, by no means will I say this book is ""bad"" or ""talentless."" However, I will say that it is not the least bit enjoyable to read. Despite this, keeping in mind that these are NOT Stephen's stories, I look forward to his next book."
4,great,"i got the two-day delivery and it arrived right on time and in great condition, the packaging was mildly shotty, but the book was fine."
1,This Derivative Book is Less than Groundbreaking,"Anyone who has read the scholarship on these poets knows that there is really nothing original here. Either Kirsch has not done his homework, or, more likely, he has assimilated much of the relevant schoalrship without acknowedging it in this sparsely documented book. I was excited about this book because I thought it would be a good introduction to some good poets for the general reader. It may well be I'm not the audience for this book, but I noticed that most of the insights had been expressed before by others and more convincingly. This is middle-of-the-road, indeed middling, literary journalism. Kirsch's claims are modest, but he is not--he reinvents the wheel and passes it off as his own singular wisdom at his best and as the wisdom of the ages at his worst."
4,A good performance.,"Recorded in 1985. Compared to other live America albums it is better than Live, but not as good Horse With No Name or the King Biscuit CD."
5,You will LOVE it!!!,The Art of Knitting and Crochet 2 was my first introduction to crocheting. It made learning to crochet really really easy. Everytihng is shot nice and close and Nancy Brown's demos are right on point. You'll make some fun stuff with this dvd...it's great if you love to knit and are always on the lookout for additional knitting projects and are interested in learning to how to crochet. I love this dvd and I know you will too!!!
5,I would buy this power strip again,"I wanted a power strip with a long cord, so I chose this model. Whenever I travel and stay in a hotel there are never enough power outlets that are conveniently located. I need outlets near my bed for my CPAP machine, netbook, digital camera charger, cell phone charger, and other items. The long cord enables me to plug the power strip into an outlet that is easy to get to rather than one that is behind furniture."
5,No problems...so far,"I got this little baby as gift from my in-laws so who am I to complain. Nonetheless, we've used it about 20-30 times and so far it's never failed."
4,Sing along Christmas Songs review,This is a good children's book of songs. It has 10 buttons you push to play the music that goes with the song your singing. Children seem to love this. A great all around children's book.
5,Wonderful!,"These were one of the best purchases I have made. I read many of the other reviews. Lots of people said that these sheets came out stiff. I can see why they think that. These sheets are THICK! They are noticeably thicker than standard 300 count sheets but they are also noticeably softer. After a few washings, these sheets are butter! I look forward to sleeping every night because these are so comfortable and soft. I have yet to find more sheet for the money. You would be crazy to pass these up."
4,"Good start, but felt unfinished","I devoured this book in about a day. I found it literary, witty, and darkly fascinating. The people and places Mantel brings to life here evoked my own Catholic upbringing and school years. I bought the book because of the review Margaret Atwood gave it (printed on the cover), and it well deserved her lavish praise.That said, I wanted there to be more. It felt like reading the beginning of a book, or like listening to someone tell me the first part of a history, and then suffering an interruption that leaves the story hanging. I felt it was unfinished, and I would gladly have read another 250 pages of this book, had they been there to read."
1,The only DW book I ever returned to the store!,"I am ashamed to say I read this book to the end. I kept hoping that the nightmare was just that- a nightmare. No, the blatent violence and gore of this book should never have been allowed to be published. Terminator or Aliens would be more restful reading!"
1,Not as good as their 2nd album.,I love Departures and Landfalls from Boy's life. I really tried to give this CD a chance but it just doesnt do it for me. Get Departures and Landfalls instead.
3,acceptable,"nothing special here... but decent backround trance. probably would not purchase it again, but not worth returning it. simple put an acceptable disc."
2,Doesn't fit the Kiddi-o Supertrike 3,"Maybe I'm too dumb to figure it out, but this basket certainly does not fit on the Kiddi-o Supertrike 3. It can be loosely hung on the front of the handlebars, but was obviously designed to fit a different trike. I'm very disappointed that Amazon promoted and sold it to me as an accessory for this particular trike."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Amazon should not have prompted people to buy this basket with the Supertrike 3 since it doesn't work with it!!!!!!! Very disappointing 2 days before Christmas when it came time to put it together.
4,STURDY BASKET...BUT!!,"We purchased this basket for the Kettler Happy Air Navigator Bike and the basket has held up well! The basket is a sturdy basket and the paint has held up well. My only con for it that it comes off the bike really easily but we were able to attach it with a tie clip but doing it this way you cannot remove the basket unless cut the clip. We do not have a need to remove the basket as we are satisfied with leaving the basket attached. Yes, I would recommend this basket but make sure you know that you will have to tie the basket down so it will not come off."
4,Great add on,"We got this as an add on for my son's Oceana trike since that model does not come with a bucket. I agree with some of the other postings that it slips off too easily, and ended up using the nylon cable ties to secure it."
3,Convenient size but not superb,"I started off with an Ipod and then went to this (b/c of cost). It is simple and convenient and has cool features, like the ability to record the songs on the radio. But the radio signal is weak even for usually strongly-received stations. After I dropped it once, sometimes the machine just turns off, especially when it is in the hold zone. I prefer an ipod b/c more userfriendly. but in terms of convenience and liability, I would choose this."
1,"Big talk, no action","These guys are lengends in their own minds butdo very little to actually help you. Of course,for 33% they will write letters that threatenlike this book. OOOOOHHHHH, I'm not scared!"
1,Surprisingly unfunny!,"I was extremely excited to receive my copy of Barrel Fever. After having read ""Naked"" and ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" I was thoroughly looking forward to another laugh out loud event. I was severely disappointed however when I finally got to read ""Barrel Fever"" strikingly not funny and dark to a fault, I had to force myself to read the whole collection. The stories that were the first and main part of the book were depressing and twisted. It was easy to tell that it was attempting to be humor but was falling drastically short. Three of the four essays that concluded the book were flat and boring and made me regret buying the book at all. The final essay however, ""Santaland Diaries"" was the diamond among all of the coal. Wonderfully funny, this last essay reminded me that, yes, I was still reading David Sedaris. If you are thinking about buying the book, borrow it from a friend and read ""Santaland Diaries"", but skip the rest."
1,this book [is bad],this books [is bad]. not at all like NAKED or ME TALK PRETTY...expected it to be funny but instead it is boring ...
3,"An uneven read, but still entertaining","Like many other reviewers, I found the four essays that conclude this book much more engaging than the short stories at the beginning. This is not to say that the short stories are bad, just that they don't match up to the quality of perception in the essays. Sedaris probes into the dark humor of everyday life with a satirical wit and a pathos that is unmatched. Sedaris invites us to laugh at ourselves, and he does so in a way that leaves his audience gasping for breath. ""Santaland Diaries"" is a phenomenonal piece that alone makes the book worth reading.As with most of Sedaris' work, the essays and short stories are written for the ear (i.e. read it aloud!)."
2,Strange...,"I have read several of David Sedaris's books. I absolutely loved Naked, but Barrel Fever was just so...strange!! I found it a little more disturbing than funny. Yes, there were funny parts, but mostly, I just kept hoping that the next stories would be better; they weren't. I still think he is a great writer, but this is not at all along the same lines as Naked, Me Talk Pretty One Day, When Engulfed in Flames or Dress Your Family In Corduroy and Denim."
3,Weird and raunchy early stories that hint at what's to come,"My first introduction to David Sedaris in the late 90s was ""Holidays on Ice,"" which I absolutely loved. I've read most of his books or listened to them as audiobooks, and the guy is hilarious and has been one of my favorite authors/essayists for years. Somehow I'd never picked up Barrel Fever, so I finally did.The stories and essays were weird, raunchy, and sometimes pushed me out of my (relatively wide) comfort zone. There were laugh out loud moments to some stories, but others left me wondering how I benefited from reading them. I can see how David Sedaris has developed as a storyteller from these early character vignettes, but I doubt I'll want to read this particular collection again. (The main exception is ""Santaland Diaries,"" which is also included in the ""Holidays on Ice"" collection."")I agree with the other reviewers here... if you're new to Sedaris, pick up ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" or ""Naked"" before reading this one."
2,Not his best,"Two of the stories in here were in other books of his I read, which was disappointing. This book is already pretty small. Most of this one is stories, which I find, generally, to be less enjoyable than his essays.If you haven't read any Sedaris yet, I really recommend picking up Me Talk Pretty One Day first. I really liked that collection. This one was disappointing in comparison."
3,"If you liked ""Naked""...","...read it again, or buy ""Me talk pretty one day"", and take a pass on this collection of contrived stories sprinkled with a few good essays."
1,Hours of my life I will never get back,"This book was painfully not funny. I slogged through 5 essays and could endure no more. I kept wondering why I was wasting my time trying to find a nugget in this book when there are so many good books out there that I could be reading.For the FIRST TIME in my life, I did not finish a book. I simply could not torture myself any more. What a waste of time.My advice would be to skip this author -- or at least this book -- and read something by Augusten Burroughs."
4,Insightful & funny & probably very right on at times.,"Hey, I haven't read this yet (but I can't wait) and I'm just as homophobic as the next person, but I've heard this guy on NPR, and find his radio broadcast insights, descriptions and portayals absolutely delightful and often right-on-the-money. Dare I say in this age of deconstruction (or whatever age we're presumed to be in now) that I often find a universality in much of what he says? Yes, I dare. Can't wait to read it."
2,Not up to the usual Sedaris standards,"Another bestseller from the humorist; I bought this in blind faith because it was a Sedaris. However, I admit I was a tad disappointed. In some of the essays, it felt like he was trying too hard to be funny; the stories seemed to lack the polish found in ""Naked,"" ""Me Talk Pretty One Day,"" or ""Holidays on Ice.""If you must read this, borrow it from a library or buy it used."
1,Barrel Fever,I was very disappointed. And I'm usually a fan of Sadaris's work! Barrel Fever was nowhere close to his later books.
2,Disappointed,"I stumbled onto Sedaris' ""Naked,"" thoroughly enjoyed it and was looking forward to ""Barrel Fever."" But the first 2/3 - the stories - were too mean-spirited, and only the last third - the essays - reminded me of why I'd sought this out. He definitely does real life better than fiction."
1,His other books are better...,I bought all his books thinking they are the same. Barrel Fever was only essays written in first person fantasy. Not based on reality. The ones based on his reality are the ones I find hilarious.I LIKED:Dress Your Family in Corduroy and DenimMe Talk Pretty One DayNakedWhen You Are Engulfed in FlamesDIDN'T LIKE:Children Playing at the Feet of HerculesBarrel FeverHolidays On IceThe Book of Liz
1,Not worth the price,"This book is simple and does not bring any insight to the process - anything beyond common sense is missing. Keep copies of all paperwork, keep track of your letters, seek cooperation from your doctor and call once in a while (but not harrass) the claim adjuster. Well, but of course."
2,Library of Congress - Emile Berliner Site,"If you are interested in an accurate account of the history of Emile Berliner and/or the gramophone, the Library of Congress has created a very comprehensive site. Go there instead,this book is very limited."
1,franklin usa outlet,"Rate this company very low, sent wrong product will not send proper product and will not respond to attemps to contact. Amazon should re-think using companies that reflect on Amazons reputation."
4,Amazingly taut story with loads of detailed characters...,"Parker's books have always had that tight, screeching around corners pace to them. I just couldn't put it down!!! Also, one major problem I have with most comtemporary writers is that they leave loose ends throughout the story, Parker does not. Each character becomes completely real within the text, even when they are fleeting. This allows one to become completely immersed in the world which she creates. Bravo Mrs. Parker, Bravo!"
4,Suspicion of Deceit Review,"Another wonderful story by Barbara Parker. Extremely good writing and difficult to put down! Although the author's newer book, Suspicion of Betrayal was a bit better and more varied with more emotion between Anthony and Gail, this book truly deserves a thumbs up! Keep up the great story line Barbara!"
3,Warning: this is for orchestra fans only,"Of the many moods of Christmas featured here, you will have to look hard for ""peaceful"". The grandiose orchestration overwhelms the choral effort. I was finally done in by ""I Saw Three Ships"", which is taken at a galloping pace and features over-the-top orchestration more befitting of a Broadway finale. If you are a fan of big production musicals, this could be the CD for you, but if you are more a fan of the Robert Shaw Chamber Singers sound, look elsewhere."
1,Worse than a bad recording,"Pros: They sing well.Cons: None of the carols are complete. They draw you in with a little teaser, tack on a big finale, then dash on to the next just as you start responding.Worse, the tracks bleed into one another, so randomizing playback sounds just awful.I'd love to have a recording of unabridged Christmas carols with this caliber of musicality, but can't recommend this cd."
3,IT HAPPENED AT NIGHTMARE INN,"The atmosphere is quite sinister and very threatening. Judy Geeson (of TO SIR, WITH LOVE fame) does well in her role as the pretty blonde heroine, and Aurora Batista and Esperanza Roy are indeed the most menacing inn-keepers since Mr. Norman Bates. Though obviously inspired by PSYCHO, this truly deranged Spanish shocker features several gruesome sequences which makes the film way ahead of its time. In fact, the film's only real drawback is the poor dubbing that makes it resemble one of those cheesy Euro-Hercules flicks.The film does indeed have that European quality from the 60's or 70's films."
4,A Good Read!,"Dave Kahle adapts many now common time management processes for the specific use of salespeople in the field. His underlying assumption is that it is much more difficult for outside salespeople to apply the usual techniques, since their lives are so filled with uncertainty. Plus salespeople tend to be action-oriented, so they don't commonly want to spend time planning or setting up systems. But, Kahle argues, such organization is critical to success in sales. While Kahle claims that most time management principles and tactics ""totally miss the unique challenges of the field salesperson,"" the material he covers in the book sounds very familiar. It echoes many other books about goal setting, problem solving, decision making and effective selling. We from getAbstract find that while this may be a helpful review of fairly common material in the guise of time management, the information is hardly unique - although its focus on salespeople's needs may give it additional value for them."
5,Works Perfectly; Exactly What I Needed,"I teach college courses, and I occasionally have students in my office and I want to show them something on the computer. I looked at a bunch of monitor arms that would let me swing my monitor around so that others could see it. This is the most sturdy, easy to use monitor arm I've seen. The monitor moves smoothly, and the range of movement is amazing. Just remember to tighten the adjustment screw to match the weight of your monitor--I forgot and initially thought my monitor was too heavy because it kept sinking. However, after I adjusted the screw, it was perfect.____Update: I've had the monitor arm for about a year now and it has been well worth the investment. One thing to note: The capacity of the arm (20lbs) is the weight of the monitor without its built-in stand. I have a 24"" monitor that is 21 lbs, but the stand itself weighed 6 lbs, leaving my monitor a lean 15 lbs that was well within the capacity of this arm."
5,Better than sliced bread,"I bought this to support a 19"" LCD Planar touch screen monitor. It is super well constructed and it and works as advertised. Ergotron makes a super product. It came with all necessary pieces for clamp or through mount and is a an absolute pleasure to use."
1,Huge flaw in design,The drivers side has a hole in the worst spot possible that allows water to drain out into your carpet. This could have been avoided with very little thought on the part of the product designer. The hole accomodates the hook in your carpet to prevent the mat from sliding forward. They could have enclosed with the mold design or provided a snap cover.
1,Weather Tech Customer Service,"I cannot give my opinion on their product as I have not received it yet. However, I can tell you their customer service is TERRIBLE! I ordered floor liners on January 4, 2010. They promptly charged my credit card and confirmed receiving my order January 5th. Today is January 28th 2010 and I still do not have my liners. I have e-mailed them twice, no response. I have talked to their rude customer reps and even their sales manager, Derick, only to have them tell me that they're backed up and my order will be sent as soon as they are manufactured. I wrote a letter to David MacNeil, the owner of MacNeil Automotive, to let him know of the poor service his business is conducting. But of course, no response.I will update this forum if and when I get the floor liners."
2,Weather Tech digital car liners,"Purchased the liners for my 2011 Subaru Forester. Took Weather Tech quite awhile to design the liners for this car. I had been using the Husky brand of liners, but was not really happy they way they allowed debris to get under the liner. When the Weather Techs arrived I was very disappointed in the coverage of the front liners, they were not nearly as good as the Husky brand. The rear liners were just plain poor quality for the price. Buy the Husky brand. They're not great but certainly better than Weather Tech."
2,Weathertech,kind of fits... cheap plastic... nothing holds them in place... they just slide around... step on them once and they are maked for the life of the product. cheap plastic scratches easy. Way too expensive for the quality.
2,"Good movie, but...","Ed Harris does his best performance here. Anthony Hopkins hasn't branched out much from his past roles, so his performance to me seems typical of what you'd expect. There are parts of this story that I simply cannot believe. I know this movie was based on a book, but in today's society where political correctness and diversity are shoved down our throats, I find it equally hard to believe that Coleman grew up with a prim and proper black family that had zero ebonics in their speech, zero animosity toward whites and were jewish to boot. It's just too much of a stretch for me. It seems to me all of this was thrown together to further the believability of the story, which otherwise would not be believable. If it weren't for me being so tired of the whole spin on race nowadays I might've enjoyed this film more. As it is all I see is a farce that begs to be believed."
5,The inefabble human intolerance!,"Four different arists converge simutaneously in that artistic work. The hidden sequel of the racism who affectes the internal life of a man of jew ascencendence who simply refuses to accept his black ascendence. He will lead this lie until his final days. And that's by itself a big problem.In the other hand the term spooky will mean for him a true whirlwind when he makes a simple ironic joke in the middle of a Literature Cathedra Magister Class.Third, the presence of a homeless girl who refuses to be the secret lover of his abusing father after her mother gets the divorce.And finally the troubled mind of a Vietnam veteran who has serious internal wounds.Four traumas that will intersect giving by result and admirable, mature and terrific reflection about the human nature and how Einstein had all the reason when he stated it was much easier to destroy an atom instead a prejuice.Fine acting and splendid photograph."
1,a very confused theme,"With all the great actors in this film who are absolutely the top, I expected the film to be excellent. To me, it is a film that does not know where it is going. It heads off in too many directions. I was thoroughly disappointed. Maybe I should have read the book first, but Mr. Roth is not a favorite author, he writes as if dialog for textbooks, and soon becomes boring and hard to concentrate on the story."
4,Great!,"This DVD is great if you are a Pilates instructor, or have previous experience in Pilates, but have neck or back issues. Instruction is thorough, clear, and direct. Wonderful to enhance instructor repertoire."
5,Men do pilates too,"I have been taking pilates privately for a year and often have to make adjustments due to neck and shoulder pain. It's of great value to have a tape at home that I can safely follow between my private sessions. Video quality - very professional, clear instruction, challenging pace. An excellent buy!"
3,A Flawed but Interesting Book,"This is quite an interesting book. It's a shame that Ananta Murthy seems to have lost inspiration two-thirds of the way through the book, and fails to provide a conclusion. As any storyteller, Indian or otherwise, will tell you, a good story requires a beginning, middle, and end. I hope that more publishing houses in England, India, and the U.S. take the initiative to publish such graceful translations of literature from the rich traditions of India's many regional languages."
1,Very dissapointing,"I expected a lot from this book, hearing so much about Shaara and how he makes history read like literature. This was not the case at all though. The characters are all so stereotypical, the plot is stereotypical. I read a quarter of the book and had to stop because it got so tedious. He is more concerned with the history of what happened, not exploring the minds of the men that fought in the war."
4,The first war,"Everyone should read this book, which is well documented . That is, if you are not afraid of losing faith in the human race in general, and in most of its leaders . It confirms many of the reports I heard as a child from my grandfather and uncles who fought near Arras and near Vimy Ridge . I cannot comment on the air battles,but I assume that the author described them with accuracy . It is a great book."
5,Good history writer,As I was growing up WWI was not taught much in any of my history classes and I figured it was time to learn. Jeff Shaara is a wonderful writer and I would highly recommend any of his books. He has a great knack for character development and these people come to life.
4,Well-written novel captures the mood of WWI,"World War I was, in many ways, the end of innocence in Europe. Because of the excesses of the war, extremism on both sides swept out the existing governments and ruling classes. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that WWI plunged Europe into dark times, out of which it would not emerge for 40-50 years. Shaara captures the darken mood of the soldiers and civilians alike. Further, he chronicles the transformation of the US Army to a world power through the sheer will of General John Pershing. As is the case in his other novels, the dialog of the world famous leaders is completely believable, though it is completely fictional. Once I year I have time to read for pleasure, and I will continue to reach for Jeff Shaara's novels"
4,"Not Shaara's Best, but still good.","I really liked the focus in the first bit of this on the Air war of World War 1. The flow of this is ok, but seems a little rushed."
4,A Good Look At The Reality Of War,"Jeff Shaara has done the nation a favor. I used to wonder why all these small Indiana towns had erected WW I monuments when the war to us was such a brief event, perhaps not even a big deal. Through Jeff's book I have learned how big a meat-grinder that war truly was, and how heroic our men truly were. Well worth the read."
2,Not what I expected. Disappointing.,"I feel a little duped here...The title of the book, ""To the Last Man"", implies that the book is about the soldier in the trenches. The cover art shows soldiers coming out of the trenches as well. I was excited about the prospect of reading fiction about the soldiers in the trenches. And the introductory chapter came through for me in fine style. Very well written and should have gotten the book off to a good start.Then Shaara spends the next dozen or so chapters on fighter pilots! How did his story of the pilots related to the title ""To the Last Man""? I can understand a need to place the entire story of the war into its historical context, but this facet of the story went on forever and ever!My attentions were barely holding on when we got to General Pershing and the AEF, but even then it fell a little flat. Too much politics and not enough on the soldiers themselves.Not Shaara's best work in my opinion. Though I shall remain a loyal fan."
3,Not Up To Par!,"This may seem unfair to review a book I am not finished reading, but the tedium I am finding may force me to ""retire"" the book early. I am a ""Shaara-head"" and have read, and enjoyed, everything he has written. I am even saving ""The Rising Tide"" for ""Beachtime"". But the personalities selected are not all that interesting (except Pershing) and the details are excruciating.I will not abandon Shaara and look forward to a sequel to The Rising Tide (which I havn't even read yet!)"
3,Good but not Shaara's best,"This novel, like most of Shaara's novel's is entertaining. However, it may be just me but WW1 isn't as interesting as the Civil War or WW2. His most recent novels on WW2 ('The Rising Tide' and 'The Steel Wave')are better stories and better novels. I personally have found them much more enjoyable, but ""To The Last Man"" is a good read in it's own right. it does deal a bit much in the 'grunt' aspect with a large part of the novel based on the fighter pilots (dog fights). However, if dog fights and fighter pilots are your cup of tea, than this is definetly the novel for you."
4,A worthy read,"I got into Shaara with ""The Rising Tide."" Tide was an excellent work, and after reading Last Man I can see how Shaara has significantly improved his craft. Last Man contains the elements of what later becomes a perfected craft. But I will say that I was taken by the lively accounts of a very misunderstood and almost unknown war. I applaud Mr. Shaara for his work here. This is worth picking up."
2,You can do better than this kit!,"I was so disappointed when this arrived. I felt like I was really taken advantage of.. The trays are cheap. better trays are from garden supply. I use my own compost. no need for that bag of ""stuff"". I could have gotten seeds for under $10. why did i pay $40? beats me. must have been the heat. was looking for quick easy wheat grass growing. i should have taken the time and figured it out before i invested in this ""kit"". please save yourself the embarrassment of buying this kit. it is so unnecessary. get some seeds.. soak and spread out on soil, keep damp with paper towel and let them grown. I learned we are never too old to be exploited!"
5,Just what I was looking for,The book included in this kit has changed my life. I didnt realize how important sprouts were. Bought the kit just for wheatgrass and now i'm buying all kinds of seeds and even purchased a sprouting kit because of the book I read that came with my wheatgrass kit. I also discovered Azomite. Forget about driving to home depot and then to nurseries looking for the recommended soil etc.. Just get the kit. It will save you time and you wont regret it!
4,good quality,"I really like the comfort grip on the handle, and the pins are a little longer than I expected also, which helps get through a thicker coat. Our dog is a lab poodle mix and she has a wavy hair coat that needs brushing a few times a week. She seems to like this brush, and with the rubber handle it doesn't get uncomfortable after a few minutes like the wooden handle the last brush had."
4,Nice single,"A year after the release of the grammy-winning album, ""Speakerboxxx/The Love Below"", Outkast is STILL releasing singles, with ""Ghettomusick"" from Big Boi and ""Prototype"" from Andre 3000.""Ghettomusick"" is a fast-paced dance track with Dre and Big Boi on it. Big Boi jumps on it to drop a nice verse in the middle, overall a really nice track.Dre really threw some people a loop with ""Prototype"", a slow Prince-like rock ballad. You really have to appreciate the whole Love Below album to like this one.This single comes with 2 more tracks from Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, ""Unhappy"" and ""Spread"". Great bargain - 4 good tracks for the price of a cheap single."
4,SBS helps increase productivity,I am an entrepreneur with a small business employing 8 persons. I have some basic knowledge of IT and have recently purchased an SBS 2000 with my HP server. I was really astonished with the ease I had installed and configured the server. Also the management of the system is very simple through the management console.I really recomend this software to all small businesses who cannot afford the cost of a fulltime IT engineers to manage its system.
5,Atlantic Coast Line Passenger Service: The Postwar Years,"Mr. Goolsby's book presents a very comprehensive review of the Atlantic Coast Line's passenger train operations from the end of WWII to Amtrak. The book is richly illustrated and it extensively uses company records, which together give an in depth behind the scenes look at ACL's passenger train service. It should be noted that despite the ever increasing competition from the highways and the airlines, ACL's and successor SCL's passenger trains were a class act right to the end. I still enjoy the ride to Florida aboard Amtrak and Mr. Goolsby book just adds pleasure to my trip."
5,One of the best teen films ever,"Jennifer Love Hewitt, Seth Green, and Charlie Korsmo are outstanding, and relative unknowns (when it was released) Ethan Embry, Peter Facinelli, and Lauren Ambrose do nearly as well! Magnetically energetic with some thoughtful introspect on teen life"
2,Lacked any true lesson,"""Can't Hardly Wait"" lacked true lesson or perception in it. For those of the audience who stated that Jennifer Love Hewitt was a ""wonderful actress"" need to actually look at her performance instead of her looks. She could have done so much more to her character--yet she just came off as a whiny little brat who just got dumped. All the other characters were stereotypical of the ""average teenager."" Yet the problem is that there is no such thing as the ""average teenager"". Teens are all motivated by different internal and external circumstances that are more than what meets the eye. Yet in this movie, the characters only were motivated about superfical things. It was semi-pleasant...but we need to look at this film with a closer eye. For those of you who wrote that you learned ""so much"" from this movie...what could you have possibly learned? Who could you have possibly identifed with in the superfical cast of characters?"
4,Just A Cool Understated Film,"Watch It and enjoy it. CAN'T HARDLY WAIT is a nice little film with a simple story. It's not the story that is memorable but its the performances from the leads jennifer Love Hewitt, Ethan Embry, Seth Green, and Charlie Korsmo. It follows a graduation party where Hewitt is dumped by her boyfriend so Embry tries to get in there. Hey what guy wouldn't? CAN'T HARDLY WAIT brings a new style and true view of teenagers instead of the smart Dawson Creek teenagers. Teenagers are confused like the ones inthis film. Watch it and you'll be surprised i was really. A GREAT FILM!"
1,...I hate teen movies,...Could these actors be any less talented and any more annoying? Could the script of this movie be any stupider? Will the American movie making machine ever stop pumping out bilge like this? There is no satisfactory answer to any of these questions.
5,May have strange plot but extremely funny!,"This movie may seen to have a boring or pointless plot but it can still be totally funny! Jokes are cracked at just the right time and i have seen this movie 4 times and want to own it. this is the kind of movie you can see over, and over, and over and....ps. seth green i know you probobly will never read this but if you do i think you are an amazing actor with alot of talent, very funny and cute! I""m even looking forward to idle hands even though its not my kind of movie but i luv you!"
1,Scam not a clam,"This knife does not come as a ""clam-pack"". Buyers beware. I placed an order and it come in a box. They even had the nerve to cross out the word clam pack and hand write not above it when they sent it to me. Now I get ahold of some person who will not work with me in customer service. Make sure you look into shipping and handling too. Seems like the more I payed for shipping and handling the longer it took to get to me."
1,Buen Viaje,I ordered this product a month ago. But I have not received it yet. I'm very disappointed and would like to cancel this order to get my refund. My son's school is almost over. I won't need this workbook anymore !!
1,Very disappointed,This product did not work with my HP Laserjet 5M. Contacted the supplier 24 hours ago and have yet to get a response. Enough said.
3,my favorite part is when. . .,my favorite part is when he makes faces to himself in the bathroom mirror :D second favorite part is when he & his wife converse in those hyperliteral phrases :D
5,"Interesting, Valuable, and Useful","Above all, this book highlights studies of success and the science of success, all written so that you can understand it and put it to use today. It is presented to not only be clear but also engaging. Each study on success is accompanied by an example of a person who demonstrates the idea in real life. The examples are wonderful, and range from famous leaders to average people. Some, such as the tale of the fall of the Schwinn Bicycle company, are incredibly valuable examples. I got a lot from this book, and I think everyone I work with would benefit from reading it."
4,Interesting Tidbits,"For a quick look into some traits of successful people, pick up Nivens' ""100 Simple Secrets."" None of what you read is earth shattering, but books like this provide excellent examples of what helps define success. In daily life we often forget some of the lessons in this book, so as a refresher, it an enjoyable read.Don't expect to come away with some sort of revelation into how people become successful. It is not here. Instead, be prepared to be reminded that the keys to succcess ultimately lie in those time honored traditions like hard work, integrity, and passion for what you do."
2,Quite negative,"I bought this little book to give out as a present to a recent graduate. When I received it and flicked through its pages I changed my mind about gifting it; Many of the ""100 secrets"" start with negative words like ""never"", ""don't""... and this is just not what I wanted to express..."
1,ABC's of Vocal Harmony?,"I regret ordering this book 5 minutes into reading it.It only covers the different scales in music theory such as the major, the minors and so on. The CDs are there only to help you repeat the scales.This is more like a book on elementary theory of music, and even so, it does not have any advice on theory application.Nothing on voice technique, breathing technique and voice training is included. The ear training procedures can be setup by the reader himself with a piano and any basic music theory book. Who doesn't know how to play the scales and sing along?Nobody can come close to being even the bathroom singer using this book."
5,"BOSTON LEGAL I, II, III....","This was an absolutely outstanding deal, and I wouldn't have known about it, but for an email from AMAZON...so, thanks very much for the mailing list!!! I absolutely love it, and getting a deal makes it even better!!!g"
5,can't beat the price,got this item on one of the great pre holiday sales. when it is something you want for a gift-half price is great
4,Pretty true to the real girl.,"Anastasia Nikolaevna Romanova, Grand Duchess of Russia, was born into a life of privledge--and love. The youngest daughter of Tsar Nicholas II and Tsaritsa Alexandra, followed by hemophiliac Alexei, she made her ""way"" in life being the family comic, hating her studies and enjoying playing with her best friend, sweet older sister Maria. But her life is shattered when revolution and execution destroys her. This is a good, if childish, read, starting in 1914 and ending in 1918. The author put in some silly facts that the cartoon Anastasia talked about, but otherwise it's pretty accurate and a good way to get children to know the <i>real</i> story behind the ""mystery girl""."
5,IT'S THE BEST BOOK OF ALL THE ROYAL DIARIES,"Anastasia is a funny, sweet, amazin book. It took me a week to finish it, that is how much I love it. It is the best book ever."
4,Interesting Portraial...,"This book was quite interesting, and somewhat historically accurate. However...there are some things written in it that gives only vague descriptions. It was hard for me to realize afterwards that this was *not* Anastasia's true diary. Personally, I believe the author did an amazing job discribing the day-to-day life of a young Grand Dutchess, but after a while, it seemed that the story began to lack. Not in truth, but in description and the portraial of Anastasia's life. I am quite pleased that, for once, the author wrote the ages of the family correctly. It seems to me that many times, the author tries to make them younger then they really were at the time (IE: the Fox home video of Anastasia). All in all, it was a good book, and did ""portray"" as one would say, the way a Grand Dutchess might have lived durring that time."
2,poor q-ty,the q-ty of the product in which i purchased recently is not very good. some part of the frame color has gone
5,Toenail Solution,"What a great product. I've got a bad back and other health problems,including impossible to cut toenails until now. What was an hour and a half of back breaking labor can now be done in ten to fifteen minutes. First review I've ever done online."
2,Is this really M:TG?,This is the first book I read from the Harper Collection. I got it after reading the OnLine Opinions. I disagree! (1) I don't think the story nor the characters have anything to do with MTG. (2) Since when we consider good writing the constant use of a thesaurus?
3,"Fast service, Pushy Customer Support","They provided the product I was looking for, but then I got email after email to write this review. I don't like to be pushed to do a review so this is why I'm giving it 3 stars."
3,"Great premise, falters towards the end","I read this book after finding it in a bookshelf at work. The book starts out great. The story is compelling, and the house is downright spooky. However, most of the scary details of the house are spelled out in the first half of the book. The entire second half is interesting, but not particularly scary, since by that time, you already know everything there is to know about the house.Also, one thing that bugged me is that there are very few likable characters. As a result, the suspense is lessened because you don't particualarly care if anything happens to them. The plot was intriguing, and I was spurred on to finish, even after things had bogged down a bit. Overall, the style was good, and though it does become significantly tamer towards the end, it is still a good read to find out what happens."
2,Started out okay,"The author did great with character development and descriptiveness at the beginning, but the story just seemed to fall apart during the part involving the second set of residents. Everything after that was less explained, and the book ended as though the author had grown tired of writing and gave up."
2,Waaaay too long....,"... and drawn out with superfluous stuff about the drawings one of the residents is producing for a book he's co-writing, the trials of a young boy in his new school, and the alcholic hazes the third house owner spends his days in. The thread that ties the stories together concerns the realtor who keeps winding up with the house on her list, and she is a sympathetic character, at least.Not a very scary book, and I admit I skimmed a lot of the filler. Could have been about 300 pages shorter."
2,"Great start, but it goes flat and ultimatly unsatisfing","Well, the book had real promise and I really enjoyed the first part of the book. Up untill the second tenets moved in I was thrilled, and scared. The rest of the book was just moe of the same. The writing was very well done, but the plot fell apart. The major fault I had was that too many questions were left unanswered and there was little or no resolution. I can't recommend this book, although, I do expect better things from thiss author. She is a goo writer."
2,nobody is home,"This ghost story was a huge yawner for me, it was cliche, boring, I didnt care about any of the characters, or even care who was haunting the house by the end. I was only curious enough to know why the heck all these spooks were even bothering being there to haunt in the first place, and the answer lies in the epilogue at the end, a one page deal that catalogs the ghosts reasons for being there, i think it was meant to shock the reader, i was like ""oh, okay, whatever"" If your curious just read the last page at the library, its more interesting then the whole book."
4,Great!!!,"You will never believe everything this woman has went through. After reading this you will have so much respect for Oprah. This is a wonderful book, that is interesting. After reading this I sat there and thought what a courageous woman she is. She went through alot as a child but this book tells the message that no matter what had happenes today there is still tomorrow and that yesterday was the past."
4,Olive's remake of 10cc's track I'm Not In Love Fabulous!,"Ruth Anne's vocals are simply amazing - breathtakingly sweet yet dark and melancholy. I can't wait to hear the new album, Trickle, out May 30. Expect the album to have much success now that Madonna's label Maverick is the driving push behind the album in the states. I certainly hope a maxi-single will be released soon featuring additional mixes of this wonderful track."
3,Great product IF you get the right size.........they run large!,"This nursing gown is made of great cotton knit - soft, comfortable, attractive, flattering the post partum shape and convenient for feedings. I really do like the product a lot.But the manufacturer's sizing chart is not correct; the gown was larger than expected. I ordered a medium and I was not a 6-8 prepregnancy, but my bust was in the size chart range...the 'girls' have very little support, if any. I should of ordered a small - the gown runs quite large and the fabric does have give to it... I would of returned the product had I not worn it. Bummer for me; I'll be washing it in hot and hoping it shrinks...."
2,Didn't like,Didn't really care for this nightgown. Wish it would have been more flowy instead of spandex. Didn't open so easy for breastfeeding either.
5,My favorite gown!,"The perfect nursing gown! I have a longer torso and smaller chest and find the top to be the perfect length, not too big. Most empire waisted clothes hit over my chest rather than under it. It fit well immediately post delivery, so it was great for in the hospital. Love that I don't need a bra with it."
4,overall good product,Very convenient for night feedings. Easy to pull down and nurse. Not as much breast support as expected and shape of skirt is not flattering for every figure.
5,Awesome Product,I was a little worried about spending this much money on a nightgown but it was worth every penny. I wore it all the time for the first week and it was comfortable and effortless to nurse the baby. I still use it at nights and it is comfortable and the fabric has no sign of all the washing I have had to do with all of the spitups.
4,Nursing nightgown,"Gave as a gift to my daughter in law. Not sure about the size, probably should have gotten the XL instead of large. Fits alittle too slim around waist. Soft fabric, nice color. I would not mind having this gown- and I am certaininly way past the nuring stage!"
2,Shrinks,"I first really liked the gown that it's convenient. But after a few washes in gentle cycle, the gown visibly shrunk, and it gets worse after each wash. Now the bust area is way too small to cover anything when I turn from side to side in my sleep everything falls out!! I ordered size small even tho I'm normally a size xs. Would have to find another gown."
4,If you love cooking,"Although most Americans have never seen an AGA range,cooking is a joy. Because there are no knobs or other controls, you learn to cook by moving items among the 4 ovens you find in many AGA ranges. This cookbook is structured so you can plan a dinner party for 10 and still have time to spend with your guests before the meal. Many people in England would surrender their Jaguar or Range Rover before their AGA Range."
2,Wishful thinking,"Holton is one of these academic liberals obsessed with the lower classes and certain that nothing good ever came from the upper classes. Thus, the Revolution had to originate with the lower classes, never mind the preponderance of evidence suggesting that elites led the masses toward revolution. For Holton, it has to be the other way around."
2,Outdated poor value,This book will do little to help your play but may help you learn how to sign up and play online.A great deal of this book looks like an informational for poker sites and the information is mostly inaccurate due to the time when this book was wrote.I wouldnt recommend this book to anyone and certain parts of the book are very misleading.A miss for me even though I respect the author Andrew Kinsman.
5,Daylight Florescent Lamps,"Really, whats to say. The lamps either work or they don't. I will say that besides the fact that they did fit my needs very well, shipping was prompt and items arrived packed well and in perfect condition. Yes I will order lamps from these folks again and save myself a bunch of miles driving and navigating through the crowd at Home Depot."
1,VERY Disappointed,"I've quoted another reviewer here because he said exactly what I was thinking.By P. R. moshofzp""these are off the shelf $2.00 cfls the seller claims 5500 kelvin. These are more like 3500 kelvin. not as pictured or described light spectrum may not matter in a porch light but this seller claims to be selling a photo flood with a daylight spectrum and is not delivering this. the manufacturers website says nothing about spectrum. Ummm maybe you ran out of the good ones and called me a sucker.""This seller is a complete ripoff. Sent me something I didn't buy. I can buy the bulbs he sent me at WalMart or HomeDepot. I'm not returning them because it wouldn't make sense to spend any more money on this transaction. (customer pays shipping, ect,ect)This seller should be banned from Amazon."
3,Just good.,"Mr. Laswell has now released many, many CD's... and is not slowing down anytime soon. Needless to say, it is getting harder and harder to find the choice discs. Sacred System, Chapter 2 is not one of them. I found it a tad more challenging than I cared for, and liked Imaginary Cuba even less. However, I remain a huge fan and after picking up the excellent 'Dub Chamber 3', I will continue to buy his stuff. Dub on."
4,IPod saver,"I bought a 60GB Video IPod on ebay, and it came with some scratches on the screen. I bought this of ebay as well and I t helped get the screen almost back to new. Highly recommended !!1"
3,"The Bedford Guide for College Writers: With Reader, Research Manual, and Handbook","Why are people posting about everything except if this book was useful or not. I, for one and I'm sure others, don't care how long it took for you to get this book or whether or not you were able to used it for class. I want to know if this book is worth my money. Ugh!"
3,Bedford Guide for College Writers with Reader,I used the book for my college class. It helps me in class. i paid a good price for the book too.
1,Midnight Landing,"Absolutely no originality to this album. I purchased ""No Bed of Roses"" along with this album and it's much better (no wonder with Reggae ace Style Scott leading the project). The whole tiime I was listening to Midnight Landing I thought that perhaps there will be one song anyway that made the purchase worthwhile, and I had to wait until the very last song to think ""yeah, maybe that one."" There was no compeling instrumentals on this album either and I really wish they would quite trying to imitate Augustus Pablo with that melodica. I won't blame previous reviewers who liked the album because I already had it before reading my first review, but sorry you people should try listening to Isreal Vibration or Misty In Roots if you really want roots music. I hope I like John Brown's Body better because I was actually looking for their Spirits All Around album when I found this one. (not an internet purchase this time). Too bad I can't return this one."
5,Great to have!,Very fast photo and video backup for vacation or work. Takes all card types and is very durable and compact. Don't try using your ipod as a photo backup like I did. It is so slow compared to the wolverine. Fast transfer means less frustration.
3,Values Have Plummeted !,"As of July 2007 cookie jar values have plummeted on Ebay. I would estimate people are willing to pay 50 % or less than in 1999 or 2000. The cookie jar collecting bubble burst. Examples-- A Hull Barefoot Boy did go for 200 easily. One recently started at 79 dollars and received no bids. A Shawnee Smily or Winnie dressed up in Shamrock or Chysanthemums (sic) etc was about 200-225 in 2000. I got each for about 100 DOLLARS this summer.If you like cookie jars-- the time to buy is now. For folks that bought jars in the late 90s, your collection is worth 50-60% less.Point-- this book's values are way out of date and using them will result in your paying way too much. Better to go on Ebay and watch for awhile or look at what jars you want went for recently via Searching History.The pics are great-- but as i said in late 1999, the coverage is not comprehensive of all makers-- focusing mainly on McCoy and American Bisque"
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!!,These ink cartridges are great! They last at least as long as the name brand and cost a fraction of the price. I highly recommend them.
2,reminds me of Donald Goines,"This book was okay. I have read a lot of books by Donald Goines, and it is evident that this writer has also. The book was good up to a point and then it was a let down. I only read it because I spent over 12.00 for the book. I am waiting for that one author who can write a serious urban erotic tale, with a tight plot and serious eroticism. This did not do it for me. Better luck next time."
4,Thirsty for more,"Well for starters this is the first time I've read any book by Noire.. ***Impressed*** the book was good, I couldn't wait to see what will happen next. I read the whole book in a matter of 16 hours. **smirk** I was kind of upset as to what happened at the end with Juicy, Gino and Juicy's brother. Overall I would rate the book 4 stars good work NOire. I do look forward in reading her other books. I have also recommened this book to my co-workers who were impressed as well."
4,I Don't Know What To Say About This Book!!!!,I know this is not a book that I would re-read. It was repugnance how 'G' and the other men sodomized Juicy. I'm just glad that it ended well.Overall rating: 3.5
5,THROWBACK,"THIS BOOK WAS GREAT,,I THINK ALOT OF NEW AUTHORS HAVE READ THIS BOOKBECAUSE MOST OF THEIR PLOTS ACTUALLY COME FROM THIS BOOK..AND THIS BOOK WAS VERY GOOD ESPICALLYFOR LIKE YOUNG TEENS/// LIKE 16 AND UP"
4,Damn Good!,"There is no need for a synopsis of this book because plenty are given in other reviews.This is the first book I read by Noire and I am indeed impressed and highly satisfied. I thought she did an amazing job developing charaters and giving us a very thought provoking, creative, and hot plot and subplots. Phenomenal Novel! Adult Content so please be advised."
3,Crazy G-Spot,"This book was an easy read for the most part. Some of the things that were done and talked about were a little over the top. But if you like raunchy, hood, and scandalous all in one then this book is the one for you."
5,THE G SPOT IS THE WHERE I FOUND MYSELF...,"I REALLY GOT INTO THIS BOOK. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE ANOTHER ""GANGSTA RUNS THE CITY WITH SEX, DRUGS, AND MONEY"" KIND OF STORY. I SEEMED TO RELATE TO JUICY AND PUT MYSELF IN HER SHOES. I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN."
2,Average Read - Borrow it - Don't Buy it,"This book is for entertainment purposes only. If you are looking for a good book to read, this is not it. The writing was very simple and the plot predictible. Was not worth the purchase of $15.00 that I paid."
4,Pretty Good Read,"It kept me up until 1 in the morning wanting to finish it. I kinda wish it wasn't so graphic with the rape. Wasnt really an erotic book, but it was damn goood still. I suggest this book to anyone who likes urban fictionI did think it was unreal at the end with all the other things going on in the beginning, middle, and so forth"
4,Awesome,"I recommend this title , enjoyable .The film only focused the british side , not argentinean side of the conflict.Thanks"
2,There are better Japanese movies out there,"I picked up this movie based on reviews I had read, and I came in with somewhat good expectations. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. Though the costuming is great, and the theory behind the story is interesting, the exceedingly slow pacing reduces the movie to what is quite frankly an excruciating experience. I actually fell asleep 2/3 of the way through because of the pacing.Needless to say I'm putting my copy up on ebay shortly, and I recommend renting this or borrowing from a friend before you buy one yourself."
3,Hoped for more details on the movie,"Mr. Pinto is correct in his review. The Complete Phantom of the Opera [which I have] is a far better and more complete book about the history the the novel, the earlier films and the Lloyd Webber stage musical. As Mr. Pinto says, far too much of this book, simply repeats the earlier book in short form. I had hoped for a book dealing in detail with the creation of the spectacular movie, but the information here is pretty thin. You won't get, for example any info or pictures on the [too understated, in my view] movie Phantom make up. This book is nicely illustrated, and should please people who want a general overview, but is hardly the complete movie companion, I had hoped for."
5,great condition,"when i received it, it was in great condition in the packaging, and it was exactly what i wanted."
1,DO NOT buy this book.,This book will not help you prepare for TOEFL at all!IT is waste of money.IT doesnt cover anything!Study with Barron's TOEFL and you will do well on the test.Good Luck!
1,A disappointment,"I generally enjoy Sue Henry's books. As with any author, some books will be better and others not quite so good, but still enjoyable. I started the book hoping for another good read, but about a quarter of the way thru, I put it down and never picked it up again except to toss it. Why? It just didn't have a plausible plot, I thought her writing was not as taut and terse as it should be, and frankly, I just plain got bored. It appears to me that she wrote it quickly so she could get another book on the market. Sue, please write as well as I know you can, pay attention to the art, and sales revenues will take care of themselves."
5,All things are possible,This story shows that all things are possible. I have a handycappped daughter and granddaugther. I alway hope for something like this to be possible . great read
2,5 star movie but....,Great movie-but which thanks to Warner Bros will not see again-I need SDH on the dvd's I buy which unfortunately eliminates the growing number of dvd-r releases which are made on the cheap without subtitles but still priced in the above average range. I wonder if companies like Warner/MGM/Olive and others realize they are missing a highly lucarative audience by this dumb-down process. It's a shame.
4,Barnard Turns Out Another Good One,"Robert Barnard's latest mystery, A Murder in Mayfair, contains a number of devices Barnard has used before. There's an engaging young man embarked on a quest for his parentage, a bit like the earlier Out of the Blackout. Then there's the solving of a 35-year old murder to help clarify current events, much like A Scandal in Belgravia. Finally, there's an unexpected homoerotic twist, like...oh, how many Barnards shall I name? All in all, this was a fast-paced, interesting, and engaging mystery. Not Robert Barnard at his best, but Robert Barnard in good form."
3,Mixed bag,"Washes Whiter Than is the earlier of the two albums and it shows. There are glimpses of the changes to come. The album varies from ballads to funk to jazz and rock with the gospel message.Never Say Die is the start of the ""classic"" era of Petra with their more straight ahead rock. From the opening crooner ""The Coloring Song"" we move into some classic Petra rock with ""Chameleon"". The album could be described as easy listening rock and finishes with the worship anthem ""Praise Ye The Lord""."
5,Amazing Unintentional Feminist Drama,"Henrik Ibsen was known for crossing societal boundaries with his plays. Hedda Gabler depicts a woman who has socially lowered herself solely for the purpose of marriage.Ibsen's use of phallic imagery throughout the play to signify Hedda's oppression is amazing. The play takes dark twists and turns. Although, I, personally, find Ibsen's The Doll's House to be better; Hedda Gabler pushes societal boundaries and expectations of women."
1,The Devil Himself,"Mr. Rockefeller is tied to the Rothschild banking empire via marriage to his mother or great-grandmother.He is a very happy man, having never missed a meal, fought in a war and born a billionaire.Read some of this, and other quotes and understand, that every step of the way he has done everything in his power to destroy the American people whom he abhors.He and his Illuminazi bankers have coerced every world war we have and had literally has the bloodof a billion people on his hands.Now you can read how Mr. Rockefeller adores Mao and major dictators like himself and wants to make this country into his personal slaves. The delight is palpable for the most evil man who has everwalked the surface of this planet.Rockefeller's own the Rand Corporation (that Daniel Ellsberg exposed for a pure body count in Vietnam) plans to start WW3 in North Korea and Iran.He will tell you that his policies, executed by ex-Nazi Kissinger, are for the greater good: yep,he's greater and it's good for him!"
3,Their power lies in your ignorance,The world's elite is responsible for every war on this planet. They predicted 3 World Wars. We are waiting for the third one that will also be orchestrated by them. Why doesn't the average American citizen not object to such tyranny? Because the average person has been dumb down by the illuminati to believe their lies. [Ever heard of mind control and MSG]. Also Jesus said if you reject Him you will worship satan and that is what is happening. We are living in a world that's run by a satanic cult. Soon the whole world will get chipped. If you deny Jesus and receive the mark of the beast [the chip] you'll burn in the lake of fire for the rest of eternity so don't take the MARK! Be ready for the rapture. Buy the book Illuminati 2 by Henry Makov for a detailed analysis on this group Mr. Rockefeller is part of.
2,rockefeller propaganda,"This book had so much potential. David Rockefeller has an amazing story to tell, but it ends up being so ""surface"" and so glossed over. For example...the rockefeller interest in/role in creating Acadia National Park in Maine, and the Carriage Roads, a fascinating bit of american history, gets all of three sentences.the book is essentially a laundry list of what the rockefellers did, w/no insight or analysis given. he needs a ghostwriter to take his rich and history laden life and make it the interesting story it could have been.if you want a good 20th century american Bio...read Katherine Grahams."
2,Not what I expected.,"I expected a movie based on fact but what I got was a documentary of the Nazi Officer's Wife. The things Jews had to do to survive the Hollocaust are unbelieveable.I'm still trying to understand how such an enlightened society could go so wrong. Sometimes I think I see a corolary to what's happening here. Next thing you know, we'll be trying to solve our energy shortage by burning mexicans..."
5,"When will you give us an update, Ms. Brecka?","This is such a terrific little guide. All the detail I needed at the time and small enough to carry around in my purse, making notes on everything I'd purchased or wanted to purchase in the future. What a great idea and fabulous writer! PLEASE GIVE US ANOTHER!"
2,Poor quality,The rechargeable lighters from the dollar store work better!! You can refill these but the flame is so tiny and it's really hard to push the button to make it light. I don't like them at all!!!
1,Crapped out early,"Refilled fine, once. But the sparker must have died. The butane comes out just fine, but not lit. Must have used it too often. Like three times. Tried to save on the environment. I expected more from Coleman. It's a shame that good old reliable brands get bought and turned to crap, or whatever happens. Phooey on Coleman. Phooey on hardware chains that carry this stuff that craps out."
5,Great Stuff!!,"Not only piano pieces as played by the master himself, but all kinds of background history and photos, include original manuscripts!! Very good for the musician and enthusiast alike, great reference for those musicians wanting a roots look at the playing styles at the end of the ragtime era; as it progressed into jazz. Hot!!"
5,Ferdinand Jelly Roll Morton,"Great! Get the history of Jelly Roll, his music, and some facts about each song!"
3,The starting point for Tales of the Jedi,"Although the Freedon Nadd Uprising is short, it is a starting point to begin your Tales of the Jedi readings. It excellently sets up the the events of the Sith War and the following graphic novels. It is action-packed and filled with the kind of drama and violence that only the Star Wars universe can provide."
4,Family History,"I was interested in my family's history and my 2nd cousin Colgate told me about this book and how it's history about our family would interest me, it has and I have passed it on to my children so they are aware of our long history starting in the 1600's early New York, New York. Also the start of Colgate company and how we are related to them. This is a great history book for the Colgate/Craig family from the 1600's to the 1930's we need to add present history to it to keep it up to date and complete."
4,"God's Promises for You, Daughter","This is a great little inspirational book. It includes scripture passage along with a related saying for each scripture verse.A great gift from a mother to her daughter, especially when the daughter needs a ""pick-me-up""!Jeanetta Bearden Pollard author of ""Mrs. Claus Shares Stories From the Heart"" founder of http://jeanetta@jeanettapollard.com"
1,Dated,"Allison Rossett is by far one of the most influential writers and speakers in Instructional Design. Her work is highly regarded. However, aside from the glossy cover this book was outdated before it was released. The practical advice in the first paragraph is valuable, but the examples are dated."
4,Somewhat dated but also timeless information.,Lots of great information. I wish somebody would do a video version.
3,Batter up but No Bases,"This is not the best of Bernie Mac movies. But otherwise it's fine. Bernie Mac character is an arrogant jerk of a baseball player who trying to hit the 3000th mark to make it in the Hall of Fame. He's hated by everyone. But when it's announce that he has only made 2,997 hits. He has to get back in the game. I loved Angela Bassett performance in the movie. As well as Jay Anthony Brown cameo as the umpire. but besides that make this a rental not a buy."
3,Not All That Good.,This movie wasn`t all that good because it`s about Stan Ross a retired baseball player who believe that he hit 3000 hits but he didn`t. I forgot what number of hits he really hit.
3,We miss Bernie Mac!,"This was not the most popular movie, but it showcased Bernie Mac's amazing talent for comedy. I laughed throughout the entire movie."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,The Bottom Line:The late Bernie Mac is appealing but the movie is long-on-formula and short-on-laughs; it's really not worth seeking out unless you're a baseball nut.
3,Mr. 2997 actually...,"I've seen the trailer for this movie a couple of times already. And usually when I see movies like this, I'll say to myself 'stooopid'. Especially half way through the trailer when they show you that Bernie Mac's character uses his 'Mr. 3000' title as a gimmic after he retires. But when they reveal that he actually only has 2997 hits and wants to go back to get 3 more hits, then it got my interest and I started to think that this movie actually looks like it might be pretty funny.Have you ever thought about how many stats there are in sports. And although it is improbable that a mistake like this can be made and go uncaught for so long, it does make for a funny story. Probably a must see for Bernie Mac fans! And a maybe see for sports fans or people just out for some light comedy."
4,Goofy Grammar,"I teach middle school students in a homeschool outreach/alt. ed. program. I use this book as homework for my grammar class. Several of my students are there because of ADHD or other learning difficulties. One particularly challenging fellow once told me, ""You know, your class is the only one where I like the homework. And I'm not just kissing up; I mean it!""This book is not a complete grammar program. It is, however, a fun and silly way to get started or do a review."
2,Ok,This book was ok in the aspect that I did get a few ideas about some ways for my children to start forming a relationship with the gods. I feel that some of there advice on how to handle children is unrealistic. Makes me wonder if they had jobs. because anyone with a job cant do most of the things they talk about. Also it is to hard to do anything like they do when you have more than one child. These people obviously only had one to deal with. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
5,Absolutely essential,"Is there a better ""emo"" album in existence? I think not. Despite some of the worst production and mixing I've ever heard, ""The Power of Failing"" triumphs in every way. It's easy to categorize this as just another slow, sad band with off key vocals, but that would be cheating yourself. This music is so much more than just generic emo. The lyrics speak to your very heart, expressing universal feelings and truths, offering resolution in a world of despair. The guitars soar above the music and take these songs in to uncharted territory. There aren't any jaw-dropping solos or anything, but the way the guitar lines flow and tear into you and finally burst open and spill over at songs end is absolutely stunning. Songs like ""Slower"" and ""July"" will leave you astonished. One of my all time favorites."
2,"Great album, bad vinyl","I was really excited to get this on vinyl as it is such a great album, unfortunately as soon as you drop the needle you can tell the vinyl quality is terrible. There are so many bumps in the record itself it literally makes it unlistenable. I don't know how people get away with selling terrible quality records, but it happens, if you really want this album it would be better buying it on cd."
5,roc's over? definitely not,"This cd is amazing. @ first i was kind of skeptical since I felt that only jay-z and cam'ron had talent in the rocafella squad. Man I was wrong. I figured hip hop was basically over with jay-z and dmx retiring in 2003, and eminem resoritng to producing mostly I feared that rap would be overtaken by mainstream chingy's and no talent rapper's such as ying yang (catchy beats but worst rappers by far!) This cd made me optimistic about the future of hip hop. This is the all eyez on me, illmatic, reasonable doubt, ready to die, and blueprint of our time. Get this cd before your left out of the humor on the cd and great tracks. Will be the number 1 cd of the year until eminem's new album drops."
5,Sick Album,"I got this album over a year ago and I still listen to it at least once or twice a week, its so sick. The only songs I'm not completely in love with are Breathe In Breathe Out, The Workout Plan, and School Spirit. The skits are obnoxious at times, but there not that long, and can be funny every once in a while. My top 5 tracks are:5)Get Em High4)Last Call3)Never Let Me Down2)Family Business1)Through the Wire"
4,skits skits skits,"this cd is very good, i recommend it to everyone...however the only downfall to the cd is the skits...there are way too many skits...its ok the first time you hear the cd but it gets old fast...there is an incredible amount of talking...however the songs are great and everyone should get the cd because kanye can spit...if the cd had more songs and less skits... it would have recieved 5 stars"
5,Simply Stunning,"This record was such a surprise for me. I wasn't actually too crazy at first with ""Through the Wire"" or ""Slow Jamz,"" but I decided to get the album anyway. I was blown away by West's creative genius with both his lyrics and his production capabilities. His unique beats have been found all over the rap industry, and he finally is getting the credit he deserves. Last year was Pharrel's turn for recognition, and this year will be Kanye's. He avoids the cliche rhymes of money, rims, rides, and instead focuses on deeper issues including religion, education, and family affairs. His lyrics, even for a ""suburban white boy"" such as myself, are inspiring and comedic. Although I haven't experienced the things he raps about, I can appreciate what he has gone through. I would definitely suggest that everyone buys this album if your sick of Lil Jon owning a rap industry that has turned to shouting and yelling about crunk."
1,Christian? I think not!,"Sister 1: I think it's sad that Kanye thinks he's a ""Christian rapper"". His lyrics are AWFUL! Can he honestly believe God is behind songs that swear every other sentence? Now I'm not to judge, but it puts a bad name on the Christians who listen to fulfilling music. If he really wants to be a messenger, sing pure music! The beats, though, are fun, but I find this CD a total waste of my time.Sister 2: Once I heard the CD I thought to myself, ""He's a Christian?"" I think it's terrible to spread God's word in such a wretched manner. I agree with Sister 1 that the beats are off the heazy. His purpose is noble, but his lyrics are not worthy of listening to. This really IS NOT a CD I would reccomend to those who pay attention to the lyrics. Nice try Kanye, but next time, read the Bible!"
3,3 and 1/2 for kanye west ablum,"even though i didn't hear all da songs da songs i did hear and saw on tv were my favorite like jesus walks which was my song of da year, all falls down as my second favorite song from da album, through da wire was a great remix from shakia, and da workout plan wasn't his best music wise but it had a very good beat, was very funny at times, and send a message 2 people made staying in shape i heard a sample of all his songs about 30 seconds of each of them da another song i think she should have made was gradutation day that had a very good beat and might have made a statment 2 those who graduate and r prpearing theirselves 4 da outside world as young adults this album is a good album can't consider yet great because i would like 2 listen 2 all of his songs one day most of his songs has strong unique beats that most people haven't heard before which is something i admire da most about kanye his words and beats is something that is always top notch"
4,the future overview,"Kayne West has the most abrupt rhymeing scheme i've heard in a while. on this cd, he talks about some rather contravercial topics, but the politics does not out weigh the true depth and perseption of this rapper. i see this man being at the heights of Jay-Z if he plays his cards right. Big things in mr. West's future...lets just hope he doesn't mess up on his next album and let critics forget about this nugget of hip-hop gold..."
3,"Great tracks mixed with ""so-so"" tracks",I have to say that I was a little dissapointed with West's first debut album. There are some standout tracks...but the album seems to be laced with stand up comedy samples and songs about fraternity/sorority houses. Not exactly what I look for in a Jay Z protege.
1,"Hey bandwagon ""hip pop"" fools ..",This album is crap ... his whole production ability is overrated also .. He's the newest best selling crap out that's why people flock to this kinda crap .. To my real rap fans pass over this non-rhyming fools album.. Don't believe the hype .. His 3 mins. of fame will be up.
5,yay fof Kanye,"and the award for funniest reveiw goes to.... musicalgenius""jeremy"" give him a round of applause folks! According to our Scholar, Kanye's album sets a bad example to dropout of college.. hmm i guess students across the country will get ahold of the cd and say ""I wanna be like Kanye and dropout"". So how's it goin at Harverd(which last time I checked was actually spelled Harvard). Lastly to all of those who do own the College Dropout, doesn't he sorta remind u of the guy in the skits!?!... as for the album itself its great.. it reminds me of old school hip hop like De La Soul and Nice and Smooth just updated.top 5 songs1. Jesus Walks2. Spaceship3. Never Let Me Down4. Two Words5. Slow Jamz"
1,Here's what I think of this album......,"I wish you morons would get it in your thick skulls the fact that rap music IS NOT MUSIC!!! Rap is a disgrace to musicians everywhere because it takes absolutely NO talent! How about these rappers actually learn how to sing or learn to play an instrument? (no a drum machine doesn't count!) Rap music is like an epidemic or plague that is spreading like cancer throughout our society.Oh yeah, you suburban thugs playing rap in your daddy's BMW look like complete fools!"
4,I'm surprised this is on MTV,Breath of fresh air in today's bling bling rap trend. The lyrics are actually about something. I'm very impressed by the production and the message of his songs. Believe the hype.
4,Almost a disappointment,"Prior the The College Dropout, nobody Kanye West and his production skills more than me. I was becoming a big fan from his work with Jay-Z. So it goes with out saying that I picked this one up on the day it was released. After major expectations for The College Dropout, I was underwhelmed. More than that, I was almost downright disappointed. Kind of like the disappointed on the day I bought The Neptunes' The Clones. But fortunately, there is enough here to keep this album just a hair above the average album. I still maintain that West is the most skilled producer in the game today. But this one was ALMOST DISAPPOINTING. I expect more from his second album - much more."
5,Kanye Kills It,"This will go down as one of the best rap CDs of 2004, maybe only getting outdone by Dr Dre's upcoming release."
4,Good Stuff,"Although there are some underachieiving ""filler"" songs, overall, this album is a very good one which can please both the fans of commercial hip-hop and rap and fans of more lyrical based rap."
4,Awesome!,"I LOVE what this dude is doing. Hip-hop is not about women, cars, ""bling bling"", crime, and money, its about speaking your truths and beleifs, paying respect, and trying to keep the peace- and Kanye does that perfectly."
1,A mataphor?,"The title must be a metaphor for West himself, because only someone as uneducated and stupid as he is would think as much of this garbage and himself as he does."
3,College Dropout= Waterlog music=URBAN MASTERPIECES!!,"Waterlog's ""Brained Off Drugs"" album and music is the only thing I have heard better than Kanye's ""College Dropout"". Waterlog's music stands out amongst a crowd of millions and Kanye's album makes mainsteam hip-hop seem out-dated, or maybe even just behind the curve. I can't wait for the next new wave of music from both Waterlog and Kanye!!"
5,definitely no regrets,"college dropout is one of the best albums i've bought in my whole life! kanye definitely proves he's different from most rappers today through his debut album. he puts soul into his music and he tackles about life and everyday problems -without the sex, money, women and violence. he also shows his sense of humor in some of the tracks. my favorites are we don't care,allfallsdown,through the wire, jesus walks, never let me down, school spirit,family business and last call. though i admit kanye doesn't possess great lyrical prowess, he makes up for it by giving his heart into his songs. now that's something special."
4,A good debut,"This album has great songs and beats songs like never ""All falls down"", ""Spaceship"", and ""Never Let me down"" are amazing not to mention ""Through the Wire"". The problem with this disc are the skits. It feals that after every single song there is a skit, and most of them but maybe 1 or 2 are stupid. This album is still good and i suggest you buy. It's not as solid as 50cent debut but it still has great songs. I just wish that those skits were not on it, and wish that Kanye could of been with another label because Rocafella sucks. Kanye West has got to join Aftermath. Westside!!!"
5,I am an idiot,"I went to Best buy last Tuesday and was staring at the CD. I wanted to buy it so bad, but then I just left. Like a buffoon. But later I picked it up, and was amazed! This CD is so awesome! Kanye West does a great job on this CD. He can now take Jay-z's place on the R.O.C. He is that good. Buy the CD!! Don't make the same mistake I did."
2,ARE YOU SERIOUS?????,"THIS ALBUM IS OK, I DON'T KNOW HOW HE GOT SO BIG. HIS FLOWS AREN'T THAT TIGHT. IF IT WASN'T FOR TWISTA HOOKING UP WITH HIM ON SLOW JAMZ, NOBODY WOULD EVEN KNOW HIM. THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT 2 OR 3 GOOD SONGS ON THE ENTIRE CD. HE SHOULD HAVE STAYED IN COLLEGE AND LEARNED HOW TO WRITE SOME FLOWS."
5,The best album,i think this is one of the best albums i own its just so sick and i recomend everyone to get it.
2,"Solid, that's it","When I bought this, I expected dope production and an average flow from Kanye. That's pretty much what I got. The skits are abit annoying, but it's all part of what he's trying to convey so I can take it. Kanye is out-preformed by just about every guest on this album(they all give pretty good verses though) but does have his moments on songs like ""two words"", ""Jesus Walks"" and ""Never let me down"". The album does get a bit monotomous and some songs are just wack (see both ""workout plan""). Not a bad debut, but not anything classic."
1,not so good,"kanye is a good producer, not a good rapper. the only good about this album was that it had some decent beats but the rappin was horrible. kanye can not rap at all, the only reason he has so much hype is b/c jay-z signed him. kanye needs to stick to producin and give up his career in rap. don't waste your money on this album it's not worth it."
5,Stunning and essential,"This is essential for any fan of music. Every single track is absolutely stunning, all deserving individual repeat-listens. As a whole this flows incredibly well and is extremely well-recorded. It sounds so clean and pure that I'm amazed these recordings are more than 50 years old. I haven't written a review on here before, but felt obligated to give it 5 stars after seeing only one rating of 4. 5 stars aren't nearly enough."
4,Very Good Book and Clear Concepts. Worth buying it for Refer,I find this book very informative and worth buying for your regular usage&reference. Though it did not cover advanced topics and give more examples in general but the flow of this book is very good and easy to understand. I strongly recommend this book for the people who want to know more about the details of Oracle9i Architecture&Administration.
4,Good product,lasts long and good quality perfume:) mature scent and is very strong so make sure your carefull with the amount
1,Waste of Time and Money,"Not only does this book have tons of typos but many of the resources listed seem to no longer exist or will lead you on a wild goose chase if they do exist. The supposed help on how to write essays and resumes states the obvious. For example, they explain that your applications should be free of dirt and stains and should be typed. If you don't already know that, good luck in college.This book claims to help non-traditional students. Of all the resources that might apply to me as a non-traditional student, I have found none worth pursuing. Either you have to pay a fee to apply for the scholarships and contests or you have to spend a fortune mailing requests for further information. I tried saving money by looking for information on the internet but ended up wasting more time than it was worth. It would be much easier to get a job and pay for your own school than spend the time and effort it takes to have a slim chance at winning a scholarship or contest that pays only $100."
2,I was a little dissapointed,"When I ordered the movie I thought it would be in English, because the movie was already out in English at the time. The Sub is still good, just not what I was expecting."
1,This is not what Mylon's music was all about (ever!).,"I was so very disappointed when I got this one many years ago on the day of it's release. This is not Mylon's music. I don't know if the record Co. or the producer or mylon or whoever was at fault, but there simply is a vacuum in this music. I can't explain it exactly, but if one was to compare it to 'Sheep in Wo;ves clothing' one would understand."
1,Turtles killer,"Don't buy this product, it killed two of my turtles. It's temperature reached 120 degree. I bought other one from Petsmart, it also had same problem. Beware!!!"
2,water is still cool,i have red ear slider turtles. my 20gal tank water still feel cold and it not near a window. my tank is right under my apartment heater vent. i thought it would be a lil warmer but it feels the same to me. and the turtle waste floats right in the lil heater top grill and i constanly have to take out and clean more then the tank itself. i dont like it.
2,great design but not durable,I had the heater for about a year. It was in a tank with four 5-inch-long red ear sliders. It stayed on the bottom of the tank and never moved. Unfortunately it stopped working and Tetra has honored my request for a replacement.
3,"Useful, but not necessariy as ice cube trays","These little silicon wells, do make cubic cubes, but the cubes are harder to remove than regular ice cube trays, which just crack out. I suppose it is easier to take out a single cube with this.However, since they are silicon, they can be used in the oven too, or as a mold for chocolates or other goodies.anyway, they are a frivolous item."
1,Piece of junk,"I have had this DVD-R for about a year. We started having problems a couple of months ago when the DVD we were watching would get hung up and we had to take it out and clean it (several times). Soon after, every DVD we loaded would elicit a ""unknown disc"" response. I took it to an electronics repair shop who told me that the laser is bad and would cost too much to fix."
2,problem with what disk i can use,i bought this dvr and i have had troblem ever since i got it. when trying to copy anything to a dvd i have trouble with the blank disk i use. i tried memorex dvd-r and it will load the disk and say i have 2 hours of record time but after 30 seconds an error message pops up and say cannnot record on this disk. so i got sony dvd+rw and they work fine. but memorex dvd+rw wont load or format when i try to use them. besides sony media what blank dvd disk can i use in this machine.
3,VIBE has done it again,"I think you would have to have been brain dead or asleep for the past decade or so to not have noticed that hip-hop has become the single most important form of art or even communication in the world. Surpassing even the internet, I think history will remember hip-hop as the most important development made by civilization in the last half of the twentieth century. There is little doubt in my mind at least that figures like Dr Dre, 2 Pac, and Snoop Doggy Dogg will, in due course, blot out such lesser figures as (in politics) JFK, (in music) Bernstein, and (in philosophy) Derrida and Foucault who some backward-thinking people still regard as more important than the fathers of hip-hop in our culture. This book does not make my claims, which is why I give it three stars rather than five, but it is certainly an emotional and compelling history of a movement more important than civil rights, the space program, social security, and the first amendment all rolled into one."
3,a good book but all scientists are from Canada,As I stated this is a good book but ALL scientists are from Canada --something I did not know until the book arrived
4,Ideal for the right reader,"I find this book well written and useful. Of course most of it is speculation based on what is known from ancient documents about Jesus' life from age 2 to 30 (of which there is little). But I think it is very helpful to speculate and have done so myself. It helps us to realize that Jesus was not some lofty deity who can't know what we go through, but himself experienced all the problems we have in this life, went through the same process of maturation and can sympathize and help us as we face the perplexities of life."
4,It took a few nights for me to really like it.,"The first night I used this pillow I kind of hated it. It felt like it was stuffed too full, it was awkward to use/move and I just kind of thought I'd wasted 40 bucks. Id been fully prepared to LOVE this pillow--I really like my memory foam pillow for my head and didn't want to give it up!I planned on returning the pillow the next day, but my husband had already recycled the box. So before I put it on craigslist I thought I should try it again. And I am SO glad I did!It is comfy, for one. And for two it lets me either lay back and kind of tilted or do the same thing forward, which is great! I'm in my sixth month of pregnancy and I really needed something better than the multiple-full-size-pillows trick I was using. It can be a little cumbersome at times and I often with that the U shape at the bottom were just a little wider, but all in all I think it was well worth the money and am very glad I purchased it!"
3,"Liked the size, still ended up sleeping on my back","I specifically wanted a body pillow that would let me still use my regular pillow for my head/neck. This was a great size for that. I put the small side toward my front, the long side up my back. However, it didn't stay snug to my back and I inevitably wound up sleeping in the middle still on my back (not supposed to in pregnancy). Also, it was really difficult to roll over with this thing. I returned it and am back to just sticking a standard pillow between my knees."
3,too small,"I guess it's my fault for not paying attention to the mini in the description. I'm only 4'11"" and I feel that it's not serving the purpose it was designed for. If I knew better, I would have spent the extra money to buy the large full version of this pillow."
2,Too small,"I am 5'1and this was too small and uncomfortable. I returned it and got the regular snooker. Love that pillow can't live without it. Spend he extra money, you will be glad you did."
2,Too small,"Works ok to put between my legs at night, but it's too small for me to use it as a body pillow. I'm 5' 7"", so I'm neither short nor super tall. I wish I had ordered a different pillow."
5,Perfect for the Price,"This pillow made sleeping in my bed much easier, especially as I got closer to my due date. I didn't want a massive pillow and this one fits me great (I'm 5'4)!"
3,bad graphics,"Everyone makes a big deal about graphics in video games these days. Why do the ones in King Kong stink so much? Granted, I've seen worse, but this game could totally pass for a PS1 game. The action parts offer a nice amount of excitement, though."
2,Just watch the Preview.,I watched the whole movie but it was just not good at all I saw all of the funny parts in the preview. So save yourself sometime and just watch the preview for this movie.
4,A fun way to transport Barbie and her friends.,"My girls have enjoyed this car for their Barbies. The windshield pops off occassionally and the seat belts, although a good safety feature to include to educate the children, have proven to be a big pain! We ended up making Barbie an illegal driver by not wearing her seat belt! My child had a hard time getting the seat belts to work. Otherwise a fun toy."
2,Disappointing,"Allot of wasted film of music & mountain and cloud scenes throughout - some useful information in the last two segments, but it appears to be a very a low-budget effort."
2,Disappointed,"I enjoyed the Japanese original very much, so I was curious to see how this remake would turn out. I was disappointed. The original version was subtle - interesting things happening in the background, great characters. The remake is not nuanced. Do Americans need to be hit over the head with a bat to understand things? Susan Sarandon's performance was very broad at times, almost a caricature. Jennifer Lopez seemed angry at the world, and it wasn't appealing. Richard Gere played Richard Gere."
5,Feel good movie,"This is definitely a chick flick. Richard Gere is a middle age man with a mid-life crisis going on, worn down by his unexciting day-to-day life. He's always wanted to learn ballroom dancing but hasn't for fear of what others might think, particularly his family. On a spur of the moment inclination, he decides to sign up for lessons and finds himself with an interesting assortment of characters who are also taking dance lessons. The students' goal is to ultimately compete in a dance off, which they do, with varying results. Gere's wife in the movie feels betrayed when she finds out what he's been doing, as she doesn't understand why he's been taking lessons. The fact that he has a young, sexy instructor doesn't help matters any. Gere and his wife reconcile at the end and women watching the movie wish they were the ones that Gere was looking at ""like that.""This is a movie to watch when you want something light and to just have a good time."
5,Best movie of the century!,Very meaningful movie specially for long time married couples who are about to lose their interest in each other. This movie will show you how to improve your life style and become someone you never thought of!
2,Cheesy,"I'd actually give this one 2 1/2 stars, because there were a lot of enjoyable parts to this film; plenty of laughs and good dancing scenes. Predictable plot, bad acting, cheesy script, and cheesier music make it not so good. Jennifer Lopez might as well have been a cardboard cutout for how much personality she shows in the movie. What happened to the girl we fell in love with in The Wedding Planner??!!! Aside from one scene of great dancing and a few other likable dances she spends the rest of the movie trying too hard to look sad. Way too many shots of her staring out windows looking calculatedly pathetic. Is she supposed to be tragic and mysterious?? I'm not sure. The supporting characters are what make this movie worthwhile, not the two big stars, I've never cared much for Richard Gere anyway."
5,The best,"This is the best movie I have sen for a very long time - awesome, inspiring story, very funny at times, very romantic and touching! A film for everyone who is brave enough to follow his/her dreams! I film for everyone who wants to be happy!The best movie ever!"
1,what a dancing DUD!,"If you've ever seen the Japanese original, this film will be a HUGE letdown, screwing it up in every stereotypical Hollywoodish way imaginable: kitsch, corniness, cliche, patronizing the audience stupidity, etc. Richard Gere is an OK actor, Jennifer Lopez is barely average (even if she's a hot babe) and this movie is just a disaster.I almost walked out after the first twenty minutes, it was so bad. The main reason I paid was the $8 tub of exquisitely chemically-buttered popcorn we had invested in, so I stayed put in order to thicken my arteries a bit more."
4,Wonderfully uplifting!,This is a great movie to watch if you're feeling a little low. It'll instantly snap you back into a wonderful mood. It's impossible not to laugh at the many wacky situations these characters get themselves into. Richard Gere is as charming as usual and Stanley Tucci steals the show with his over the top portrayal. A romantic riot all rolled into one.
3,Quilting book,"Book was described as 'like new', and price was great; but when received it had a slice through the back cover which luckily didn't harm the DVD held inside. I'm just dissappointed in the misleading description."
5,"Great live disc, tons of energy!!!","If you can get your hands on this one, GET IT!!! Bo Ramsey's famous guitar work is all over this one, and the band assembled here is locked in and air tight. This is probably one of the greatest live discs I own, ranks right up there with Live at the Fillmore by the Allmans, Muddy Waters Live at Newport and Live at the Regal by BB King. You might have trouble finding it, so just go to Bo directly, he's got copies."
3,???? SO YOU CALL YOURSELF A MAN,"I LOVE CARL WEBER, HE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS. I BUY ALL HIS BOOKS WITHOUT ANY SECOND THOUGHTS! BUT I WAS NOT IMPRESSED BY ""SO YOU CALL YOURSELF A MAN"". THE NOVEL LACKED THE WEBER DRAMA! PLUS THE MEN IN THE BOOK DIDNT SEEM TO HAVE BACKBONES. THERE IS A SHOCK OR TWO IN THE STORY BUT NO WOW FACTORS. OVER ALL I ENJOYED THE BOOK. I KNOW THE NEXT ONE WILL BE BETTER MR. WEBER I CANT WAIT!"
5,SUPERB,"This is an awesome read!! The ladies of the book club thought that the storyline was very interesting and everyone found it hard to put down. One member thought that the story was disturbing. If this is disturbing then so is life! Carl hit the nail on the head in this book. He leaves you with your mouth hanging open, yearning for more. Superb job Mr. Weber. We're hoping that ""The First Lady"" will be just as good."
2,Dissappointed,"The books was just ok. The characters developed in an unrealistic way, in my opinion. It seemed rushed, and not Carl Webber's usual best.I'm still a fan."
4,"Drama, Drama and more Drama!","This book was really good. My mouth was wide open after I finished it. I became so engrossed in the story that I missed all of the clues to the lives of these three best friends. I must say that this book by far is the best by Carl Webber.""So You Call Youself A Man"" is about the secret lives of three close friends. James, a husband and father, finds himself paying the piper for a slip up he encounered during a dark period in his marriage. Brent, the cutest of the three, is a born again Christian training to be a deacon has to come to grip with who he really is. Sonny, has a side that his best friends has never seen until it is too late. The book will have you turning the pages to the very end! Good Job Mr. Webber! Keep em' coming!"
5,Loved it,"I loved it. It's well written, keeps you in suspense. And some character's story continues in ""The preacher's wife"" or whatever it's called. I sent my man this book while he's on business. He read it in less than a week. I read it in 3 days."
4,so you call yourself a man,Suspense from beginning to end. Very well written.one would wonder why one individual would go through such lenghts to keep a partner
1,A case that doesn't work,"I have this case, and it's the genuine Motorola article. However it is worse than useless for carrying the Pebl phone. When the phone is placed into the case and the top strap is closed, the phone's external display changes from time to ""T-Mobile"". I believe this is being caused by the case exerting pressure on the phone or it's buttons. It's repeatable and very annoying.Even if the case didn't cause the problem described above, it fits too tightly and the Pebl is very difficult to remove from the case. And there's more, the case sits too far from the belt due to the poor design of the swivel.This is junk. I wish I hadn't bought it and I'm looking for a holster that will actually work with the Pebl."
3,"Just OK, Not Quite What Was Expected.","This book was well written and had great content, but I do not feel as though it was an all-in-one book. A lot of the information is common sense, and after reading the book, I felt as though I still needed to read another. Good book as an introduction into the breed."
3,Heating Up Christian Rock,"Being one of the innovators of Christian rock, Petra helped change the way we perceived Christian music. They continue to break the mold with On Fire.From the opening power chords of ""All Fired Up"" to the closing keyboards to ""Homeless Few"", On Fire delivers a more powerful Petra.It's interesting to note that this is the preceding album to Beyond Belief, arguably their best album ever (my personal favorite), for it appears that On Fire is heavier than Beyond Belief. This doesn't make one better than the other, but it shows the band's ability to write for the song and in turn for the album. On Fire is, ballads aside, a very aggresive album, with songs such as ""All Fired Up"", ""Defector"", ""Mine Field"", and ""Somebody's Gonna Praise His Name"" moving fast and furious with it's lyrics of urgency in spiritual warfare.On Fire is a fine album and if you enjoy Petra's more rocking albums, heavy on guitars and rhythm, this is definately for you."
4,"""I could get used to this...""","I know that a lot of people say this in a lot of reviews, but all the other reviewers here don't know what they're talking about. Speaking from a completely unbiased point of view (having never heard ""the ugly organist"", the album that everyone seems to be comparing THIS one too) this album rocks. Flat out rocks! If you like bands like ""At the Drive-In"" then you WILL like this. No question. If you hate new radio mainstream rock, you will LOVE this album and everything it represents."
1,HELP!! No Sound is coming out of my system,"I've had this Philips System for a year and a half bought brand new from Philips. Suddenly there is no sound comming out, and the door gets jammed. They have been no help at all at Philips and have advised to take the unit to ANY repair shop. First there is no reapir for a system like this. They cant even reapir it. They said to try the software upgrade (which still may not work)and I feel I should not need one so soon. i can see if I had it for years. I loved this system and disappointed I cant enjoy it any longer. Anyone know of repair I may not know of??????????"
2,not worth,Its the same problem. It s a preety nice system but it s not work. The cd jumps all the time and it takes alot of time to read a simple dvd. It s not worth the money i spent on it
3,"Good subwoofer, but not much of a Surround experience","The Surround sound experience is somewhat ambiguous, there are moments during a movie where you are indeed tricked into thinking you are hearing sound effects from the side or behind, but 90% of the time you won't.In addition, just having one digital input (and co-ax!) seems a bit outdated to me. And what's the idea behind having it in the subwoofer rather than the main bar, where all the other plugs are?However, the set-up is really easy and I don't miss all the wires my previous 5.1-system had at all! And the design is very sleek, too.All in all, you get an audio system that is much less ""invasive"" in your living room, but you pay with a fairly limited Surround experience."
1,Video Noise in 1080p,"Be careful buying this product if you expect to upconvert to 1080p resolution. There is a discussion thread concerning this in the discussion area so check it out. Essentially you get significant video noise in the form of green vertical lines in 1080p. Frankly, the more I read the more I suspect that most people simply haven't tried 1080p and thus haven't encountered this yet. Or they don't have a 1080p capable TV. Could be wrong about that but I do know that Philips has their head in the sand when it comes to this problem and their customer service (if you can even call it that) is horrible. Too bad because the unit is a good idea, looks great, and otherwise functions as advertised. I'd wait until another company with a clue comes out with something similar in Blue Ray."
3,icky.,"Having read this, I must say, I've learned nothing about the Wicca of Love, let alone what on earth it is.Skip this silly thing, although it is not a bad gift for a lovey-dovey person you feel close to....but I wouldn't give it to me, for example, or a serious Wiccan, Witch or Magus.It's a sort of Wiccan equivalent of a Romance novel... You know, the kind of book you order in a way that no one knows you've purchased it!"
1,"This is a play, not a history.","This is not about CHina, any more than Edward Albee's ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" is about Virginia Woolf. For info on Mao and the Long March, see Edgar Snow's ""Red Star Over China"" or Harrison Salisbury's ""The Long March."""
5,Rin,This movie was awsome. It has a wonderful storyline I could not stop watching it. It arrived very quick great packaging no damage to the movie at all.
1,Don't Buy the Kensington Digital Photo Frame,I purchased this product a number of years ago and never managed to open and install it until yesterday when I found out that current operating systems no longer support the product so it did not work. According to Kensington it only works with Windows Me or Windows 98. The company no longer makes this product and provides NO tech support.
2,Disappointing,"For a Mission Impossible fanatic, it's passable, but that's all. I've watched the first four seasons, and they are mostly very, very good. This 5th season is not nearly so. The sets are very artificial-looking. Many of the plots are weak, and the acting thin. Leslie Warren is awful in the beginning but steadily improves as the season progresses. Unclear why Sam Elliot alternates with Peter Lupus, who actually develops a personality after four seasons of blah. I did not like that the introduction of each episode is inconsistent one to the next. Some of the character actors utilized throughout are excellent, such as George Sanders. This is Leonard Nimoy's second season, and he is not as good as in the first, but this may be due to the weak plotlines. Peter Graves and Greg Morris are the stabalizers; very good each time out.I hope the final two seasons will improve."
5,Great price and good product,I have never found HP color cartridges to last very long so buying them at this price compared to what is charged in stores is the only economical way to go. Packaging is not fancy but product works exactly the same as ones 4 times the price from stores. Buy a few at a time and shipping is free.
4,Real page turner,I enjoyed Mr. Helix's descriptions of the experience of being a soldier as well as the adventure. The ability of the man to overcome odds and to uphold his beliefs was so well portrayed. Thank you for the opportunity to get lost in a good book.
3,Short life,"The quality of these filters is fine and I've seen no issue with them. However I have found that there are another type of filter that will fit in the same application that have a much longer lifespan. This filter seems to have a consistem media, whereas the newer filters have a wound string type construction. In my experience the newer ones last 4-5 times longer. Therefore, while I was happy enough with these, I'll be looking for the newer construction type going forward."
3,Consistent Quality...,"More good stuff from Africando. Temedi is the slammer on this CD and runs hard from start to finish. Several other good tracks as well, all backed by some of NY's finest musicians.There's a crazy array of languages - 8 total for 11 tracks, including Spanish, Wolof, and Haitian Creole, to name a few. Makes for a unique salsa listening experience when you're used to understanding what's being said. With this Cd you better get the liner notes if you wanna know what they're singing about!Not my favorite release from Africando, but unique, quality cuts with a great band, as always!"
1,red flags,"The author's time was misspent. I found his testimony to be salacious, and ultimately lost any credibility he had with me. His warning to the church is also misdirected. The problem is NOT with the contemporary authors he takes out of context to make a point, the warning should go to the church who only hears half of what these authors are trying to say. Brian is guilty of the same. His warning should be for a people who would only hear half of the contmpleteive message... Those who only want an experience OF God, and not the experience of a relationship With God, wich requires obedience, humility and faith."
4,To bad I didn't get this earlier!,"I am a DJ at a country station in Juneau, AK. I just received Paul's single ""That's What My Daddy's Fighting For"" in the mail this morning. After listening to it I must say that I am very impressed, not only with the writer's abilities to put into words what so many of us feel, but also Paul's vocal style and talent. I look forward to hearing more from him in the future. Once I get the ok from my Program Director...this song will be on the air in Juneau...that's for sure. Good job Paul!!"
1,"Dull, Boring and Corny","I have read so many British (and some American) chicklits in the past 4 years I think I am qualified to voice my comments here. If you are looking for a contemporary author such as Sophie Kinsella, Louise Bagshawe Isabel Wolfe, Helen Dunne,or Clare Naylor, then don't even attempt to open this book.This is NOT a chicklit. I highly doubt people talk or think like Chloe anymore. (Also does she have any friends of her own age?) The style of writing, the pace and the characters just remind me of the turn of the century, and I don't mean the new millennium. I can only picture an old maid librarian writing a fantasy story like this. It is un-realistic and trite. It should really be sent back to the time-tunnel."
4,Must love indie...,"""Elephant Shoe"" is a touching, extremely low-budget indie film that runs only 25 minutes or so. It was an audience favorite at the 2006 IFCO Winter Gala, and later at the 2006 World Film Festival.A stubborn, sullen college-aged boy named Eamon moves to rural Ontario, where his isolation is disrupted when he meets and is romantically pursued by a lovely deaf girl named Daisy. This short film chronicles their brief romance mostly through flashbacks and ""home movies.""I enjoyed the short film for its simplicity and small-town charm. I'd advise only appreciators of indie film to see this, since the plot and character development are lacking in depth due to the low budget."
2,Looks like a basic booklet that was made into a book,"I started to count the number of pages that were blank or only had one word on a page, but there were too many.I looks like a basic instruction booklet that the publisher made into a book.Out of about 100 pages, probably half have more than one word/number on them.The only reason that I didn't give it One star is out of respect to the ""author"". Although I doubt that it was his intention to make a book out of it."
1,This CD is just not very good,I have several other Dixie Chicks CD that I like but I just personally hate this one.
4,Very good album,The title track is fantastic as is Not Ready To Make nice but overall I preferred Wide Open Spaces and Top of the World
3,The Power of a Producer,"I love the Dixie Chicks. They're they only band I have fully loaded on my iPod and are the only band where I've yet to find a bad song on any of their albums/CDs....until now. This is a good album. It could've been great though....the production STINKS!!!! It's way too slick and ""pop"" ish. Yet you can hear the Dixie Chicks' true sound and voice guggling just below the surfice. This could've been a GREAT record. Grrr!!!!!! Chicks, run for your life and back to your old record producer!!!!! You shouldn't be ready to be nice to this new guy! He's stolen your style!"
5,"I Love My Country, But Fear My Government","Not much point in adding praises to what is here, but then again I am a little disturbed at those bashing the pro-American stand this trio takes and not truly caring about the music itself. Freedom of speech is great but then again so is the right to bury your head in the sand when people like Natalie Maines speak the truth about what terrible leadership our wonderful country has.If you don't love our country enough to hold it accountable when it blindly follows incompetent ""leaders"" perhaps you should leave it."
5,absolutely fantastic!,"I love these gals. I saw them at the Savvis Center after Natalie made that wonderful comment about Bush. I just love her and her honesty. And I totally agree with her. I feel the same way about Bush and his stupidity. I love this new cd. Especially "" Not ready to make nice""Very good! I think that the idiots who trashed the Dixie Chicks for their honesty are very mindless people and don't have thoughts of their own. Bravo, Natalie. You are one brave chick. And I hope to see you in concert this summer here in St. Louis. You guys are great!"
3,More Pop than Country,"I have to say that I am disapointed by the Pop flavor of this album after the excellent country/folk harmonies on ""Home"". By far my least favorite of all the chicks work. Still, it's a decent album with a few stars, such as ""Lullaby"", ""Lubbock or Leave It"" and ""The Long Way Around""."
5,Another excellent statement from the Chicks,"I have been waiting for this CD,I knew it would be great. But I was wrong, It's FANTASTIC!!! I see the nominations adding up as i type this. I hope they win them all. Great work Ladies!"
2,One Good Song On A Just OK Album,"I told my husband several months ago that the Chicks would sweep the Grammys more for their political statements than for the quality of their latest effort. If I were an artist, I would want to be acknowledged for my music than for ""sticking it to the man."" I found this CD lacking. Other than the one standout single, the album just moves along with one song running into the next. Don't get me wrong; I love the Chicks. I love Natalie Maines' voice and the tight harmonies. I just find their earlier work far superior. BTW, my husband, who will defend the Chicks all day long, can't even list five songs on the CD. They're that nondescript."
3,It is hard to decide who hates more...,"I just read a five-star review by woman who accuses negative reviewers of this CD as being guilty of ""hate."" Yet, when I read her review, I don't get the feeling that she's just luke-warm about Bush. There is certainly a lot of vitriolic hate in many of the pro-Dixie Chicks reviews, as there is in some of the few negative reviews I have read.I think politics is coloring a lot of the reviews unfortunately. I bought this CD based on the more numerous positive reviews and I will say that I am disappointed. Given all the hype, the album as a whole was quite a let down."
4,lullabye,"soft, beautiful sound, touching lyrics, I am so happy the chicks are back. They are the full package. They are multi-talented. Please don't waste your beautiful voices and music. George Bush is just not worth it. Two years ago, this country was in a scary place. I think people are beginning to wake up, so please stay with us. Your talent is rare and beautiful."
5,Don't need country,"I love this album. The Chicks say they're leaving Country Music. Well, country left Country Music a long time ago and the crap that's out there now isn't worth listening to. The Dixie Chicks are too good for Country Music. Their fans will follow where they go and that's where I'll be too."
2,Hollywood's Tail Wagging The Dog...,"I've always loved the Dixie Chicks' music, and Natalie's voice is amazing, and despite my disagreement with their political leanings, I am not disputing their talent. However, I can not in good conscience call this album one of their best, nor is it Grammy material. How can you possibly compare this album to Fly, Home, or Wide Open Spaces when only a couple songs on the CD display their real talent? This clearly is not of that same caliber. While some may say the Grammy for ""Best Album of the Year"" is a vindication, I say it's nothing more than a sham further proving the agenda of Hollywood to control public opinion. There are so many talented artists out there right now that I don't know how anyone can possibly say they earned this award with the current album when it is such a disappointment. It's unfortunate."
3,Same Old Chicks,Nothing new about this CD. It sounds like all of their music. They can carry a tune but they aren't too bright... They should stick to music!!!!
1,"Actually,zero stars is more appropriate","The Dixie chicks are not country anymore folks.They are more of a vapid,awful pop band who are more into making boring synthesized music.I could not hear even a single note of a guitar on this album.And the attack on George Bush was sickening.Stay away from this crap.Get any cd from Bob Dylan instead."
1,Another One Bites The Dust,"So, let's see... The Dixie Chicks have totally abandoned the musical style that made them famous (has anybody heard from Martie and Emily's instruments lately?)in favor of a bland, guitar-based pop. They've gone from writing and/or performing happy, up-tempo music with a wicked sense of humor in favor of coming off like a collection of whiny, preachy kvetches. And then to make up for all that, they've decided to go out of their way to annoy the majority of their original fan base. While I may own several Dixie Chicks albums, this one will not be staying in my collection long enough to join them."
5,In spite of the right wing bashers who still insist on taking cheap shots...,"The Dixie Chicks proved their critics wrong. This album is filled with beautiful songs sung and performed by extremely talented artists. Winning every category they were nominated in last night was just icing on the cake for Chicks.Buy this album. It contains excellent songs performed by great musicians.For those of you who are still making the threats and throwing the insults, don't you find your behavior hypocritical when you are accusing someone of being un-American for using one of the founding ideals of this country...free speech?Grow up and face the facts that your side has lost and contributed to the degradation of the country you claim to love."
4,Why apologize if you're not sorry? That would be lying.,"This is a review of the album, regardless of what the chicks have said in the past. The album is solid. It's a great buy, and there's a reason it's selling so well. Bravo to the chicks. A fantastic record. Very driven, and musically strong. Natalie's voice has really grown."
5,Love it!,"It took me a couple times listening to the album, but now it is all I listen to in the car with my son! Lullaby puts him to sleep almost every time!"
3,long awaited,"i waited along time for the new dixie chicks album. it is satisfactory but a little more originality would have been appreciated, but i dont regret the purchase"
2,Dixie Chicks fans apparently don't read newspapers...,"It has been more than three weeks since Natalie Maines denounced patriotism - but their fans still keep writing reviews here at Amazon claiming they are ""patriotic"" (see below). How can you be both patriotic and against patriotism at the same time?The music on this CD quite unexiting. It would almost be boring except for Ms. Maines whiny vocals, which are irritating enough to keep the listener agitated. Don't waste your money."
4,Seriously awsome!,"I love the chicks! I even bought a copy of this cd from target so that I can order tickets to their tour early. I like this cd and it is their most serious album. All of the other cd's have been on the fun, flittery, female side. It was about 3 strong women having fun. This album is about the same 3 strong women faced with grown-up problems and adversities. This has less bluegrass. I love the bluegrass and wish there was more of that. Wonderful piece of art."
5,review for Blackjack - 34,"I received this book in the mail today, and found it to be very intriguing - to say the least. After looking through the first couple of pages, I looked a little closer, and found on the cover the found the book was previously released under a different title. (No Greater Love). Hopefully, the different title may offer some different views concerning events that had happened. It seems that re-releases are often times better than the original pieces. I am looking foreward to reading the book titled: BlackJack-34. Thanks for the quality and efficiency offered.SemperFi>> Lt.McK usmc retired"
5,A soldiers View,"Greater Love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. John 15:13Very True, like many other readers of this book im am still a highschool student but i found the book to be thrilling and knowledable. I am currently doing an English report on it. Thank you Donahue."
3,"OKAY, THERE ARE SOME GOOD POINTS...","I'll give them that, it's a real nice sounding album, but its kind of been done already and done better by Red Chord. Death metal slash hardcore vocals are a nice touch. It's not bad sounding, but there are bands that sound even better then this one. I'm sure some people will dig this, but I found it to be redundant. Sorry. If you don't own many hardcore cds then give it a try and I'm sure you'll like it. Diehard hardcore fans will like this but nothing new here..."
2,Not appropriate for children,"I bought this book for my son and was quite surprised to discover that some of the pictures were inappropriate for an eleven-year old. I'm hardly a prude but I can't understand why a book on this topic would include sexist, suggestive photographs of female fans. I try to teach my son not to view women as sex objects but a handful of pictures in this book have little to do with baseball or spring training and do just that. Shame on the authors, who should know better."
5,i love this CD and will purchase another one,"the music/lyrics are calming, reassuring and inspiring......love this CD. Planning to purchase another one as a gift, I enjoy passsing on good music."
5,Hysterical!,"This cd is so funny. Sean Morey is the best! I heard one of his songs on a local radio station and decided to try this cd. Ever heard ""The Man Song""? It's on here, as well as ""The Woman Song"". My personal Favorite on this cd is, ""A Hairy *ss"" to the tune of ""Aquarias"". Try it - you'll love it!"
3,Maybe this and another book,"I used this book while hiking the trail and thought it was only somewhat helpful. It was nice that it explained the different churches and bits of the wall, but I felt it had a major downfall. While Burton included the location of pubs on the grid maps, he did not show the location of accomodations. I ended up having to go on the National Trail website and trying to draw in on the grid maps where I was staying for certain nights. This ended up being a problem since I drew one night's accomodation in the wrong place. There was another Hadrian's wall book (I think it was red-sorry, I can't remember what it was called) that many people hiking the wall also used and it looked more helpful since it showed the location of hostels, hotels, and b&bs."
3,Tracks,"The tracks played the right songs, but they were labeled differently on the CD. I had to retype the song names into iTunes. The only other thing that was disappointing is that the songs sounded like a CD, not like the LP scratches in my memory. CDs with songs this old should really be offered as CD-quality AND with scratches, hisses and pops, in mono like they sounded way back then."
2,This book was not the comfort I was looking for.,"This book did not meet my needs for comfort or answers as to how to deal with my feelings. My mother died nine weeks ago, and I was hoping to find letters from other women feeling the same things that I am right now. Most of these letters seemed to be from women whose mothers had died many years ago and alot of them sounded as if they didn't get along with their mother. I would not recommend this book to other women dealing with new loss of a much-loved mother."
3,Useful but there are better books,"One gets the impression that Strauch sees people involved in accidents as 'patients' who symptoms must be probed or worse that his approach is more like a pathologist, seeking the cause of the error. Hence heavey emphasis on substance abuse testing for example. Much better is Dekker's book The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error. The latter is better preparation."
1,Too small!,"This is such a tiny tea set. Do not buy if you are buying this for your child to actually use/drink from. This is more like a set for decoration use. The cup will only hold maybe 1 oz water. The plates are maybe 3 in diameter. The entire box that this came package in is only 5x8, maybe. I was very disapointed in the size. This is a super cute set though, just very tiny. I'll be sending this set back."
4,noce,"This small dictionary is packed full of the idioms,and 21st century words. I like it a lot. I would recommend it."
2,The biggest problem for senior users.,"I expected this dictionary so much until I got it, for the former edition was quite attractive, useful and handy.But this second edition has smaller and thin fonts, thus the Readability is much worse than the former one.Why do they layout like this? - they leave too much empty outer space.It's a pity.Hwanbom"
4,good,I needed a good reference and oxford is well known for excellence. so I wanted the best and i was not disappointed.
3,Dictionary,"I have been very disappointed with this dictionary. Because of its size, I expected it would be a good source for words; probably because it is combined dictionary & thesaurus, there aren't any where near the number of words to search that I'd expected. I've looked for word spelling or definitions only to find the word isn't in this dictionary too many times."
5,Not your average singer/songwriter,"This is one cd that gets played over and over and over. The music gets me out of my chair and dancing in my living room. Her words are comforting, inspirational and energizing. Even her ""sad"" songs contain a kernel of hope. Merrie is one amazing artist and I can't wait for her next cd!"
4,unchained,"setting up the software required 2 tries because microsoft tried to help, but IF you read the instructions (I know, how blase!) the install works fine. Nice little headphones, will probably get another set for work. The range is not huge but is considerably larger than ones with a cord, and if you get disconnected you have to reconnect, it is not automatic, but, for the price, they do the job."
4,"Good episode, had potential","This episode happens during Season One while Shendu is still stuck with Valmont in his statue form. I would have liked to see more of Lo Pei's back story... he is not the Immortal that banished Shendu with his siblings, I would have liked to see what Shendu did to be able to escape the Void."
1,Crayola coloured pencils,I am preparing for my elementary-level art class and have just spent almost 40 minutes attempting to sharpen a box of crayola pencils. The leads are so brittle that each pencil has to be sharpened three-four times on average. My table and floor are littered with broken bits of leads!! I would not recommend this product to anyone-- look for another brand!!
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"It's been years (or rather dozens of years) since I've used Crayola products, and I have to say I was not at all disappointed when I picked these up after such a long time. I use Prismacolors in my professional work, but wanted to cut costs and use cheaper pencils for random doodling/color-books. The color in these pencils is far better than I had expected, though obviously not comparable to higher-end products. The colors that come in the box are fantastic, but I do find certain shades are very close to each other. Other reviewers have mentioned that these pencils break easily, but I haven't had any trouble when sharpening them. I might suggest investing in a better handheld sharpener if you find them breaking on you. Overall I am very happy with this purchase and will continue to buy from Crayola."
4,"good picture, good price","For a very reasonable price, you can have a very affordable, high quality Television with all the features of the ""big boys."" Why the less than perfect rating? This TV is way too sensitive to power spikes (a normal, common event in every home) and sometimes won't turn on.I sometimes have to unplug the TV, lick the plug and put the plug back in while simultaneously holding the power button to make the TV come on. I am not making this up. I thought my TV had died until I started trying different things to make it come on. Sometimes it will be ok for months, but then it won't turn on unless I unplug it, wait, lick the plug (or otherwise get it damp) and plug it back in while holding the power button. Pretty inconvenient."
4,Informative account,Authors made an excellent job with a dynamic narrative and well researched content. The Company is a good source to get a rapid understanding of this important social innovation.
1,Not the real thing...,This was not in the retail package but just in the inner cardboard insert and even that had been opened. I believe it was used or a refill and returned it. I had to go to the HP site to get a new cartridge.
5,The Most Provactive Horror Stories Ever Told,"This collection of Clive Barker's legendary books of blood play more like a graphic comic book novel for mature readers. No coinicidence- he wrote for Marvel comics and also had Hellraiser and several stories from here and In the Flesh put into graphic novel form. He swears a lot and there is also a lot of blood shed. But is Clive Barker, as big an icon as he is, are his works merely homoeroticism disguised as stylish horror? As it appears, the author has been romantically linked to other men since the early 1990s. Debuting on the bestseller list, these propelled Barker to fame and became the new face of the horror through most of the 1990s."
5,barkers book of blood,clive barker has a descriptive talent unlike anyone i have ever read plus the stories are bizarre and always interesting.best book and value for money that i have purchased in ages
3,Entertaining!,"I found this book at my church's bazaar table ~~ and it was very entertaining! I love books about women becoming friends and exploring their friendships and this book is no different. These women all met up at the Chicago Women's Conference ~~ and the main character, Jodi, went only because her boss, Avis, was going. She also hoped to make some new friends as well.There at the conference, a group of women met together for prayer time, and decided to remain prayer partners after the conference. Throughout several months, they all confronted their own personal problems and got to know one another and prayed together.It's a cute book ~~ definitely light reading. I am actually amazed to see this book out there ~~ I am a fan of chick lit and it's nice to see something like this out there! If you're looking for a good book to while away an afternoon, this book would be it.1-13-06"
5,This is what christian women should be about.,This book is awesome! I recommend it to not only christian women but women in general who need an idea about what friendship is all about. The fact that women of various religion and race can form a relationship that doesn't tear down but lifts up is awesome. I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.
1,Not as I expected,Not very happy with this product. It would turn on for about a minute and then turn off. I don't think cycling the furnace on and off every 10 minutes is good for the furnace. I ended up putting my Honeywell T86 thermostat back on until I find one that works.
1,RECEIVED WITH BURN HOLE IN PRODUCT!!!,I am very upset at this product. I received the product with a huge burn hole in it. The burn hole is right above the heat off and cool switch. I will update about sending the product back to see if they will send a new one.
4,"Challenging, Insightful, Practical","If you're looking for a book which will enable you to grasp the concepts of adult learning in the 21 century then The Adult Learner is a must read. Covering the latest perspectives on adult learning this book contains practical information relevant to any field of education. The Adult Learner addresses more than just the theories of adult learning, it provides timely solutions to empower those who desire to transform the learning experience."
3,Men,"This obscure band from the Akron late 1970's punk rock scene that also produced Devo and The Waitresses (along with Chrissie Hind), had one great song, and this CD has it. The song is ""Men"" and it is a clever and tuneful song about the problems of boys and girls getting together. It is worth the price, and I have searched for this song in any form for almost 30 years (I understand that it was on an obscure Akron punk compilation called ""Bowling Balls from Hell"" that I could never find). Unfortunately, the rest of the CD is pedestrian at best, but again ""Men"" makes it worth it."
3,Tree Mug,The mug tree is very nice but I had to glue one arm in and glue the bottom because the screws just wouldn't work.
3,10 Minute Trim - just what it sounds like...,"The price is a bit steep for what it is, and Shane Ransley is probably not used to being in front of the camera all that much; however, if you are interested in learning to do your own barefoot trimming, this isn't a bad little intro. For me, the ""landmarks"" used in trimming the foot and the basic ""how-to"" was the most informative part of the video. I have watched trimmers, any number of times, but never had the process explained in detail. The trim could be critisized as being ""rough""; but, as far as I can tell, the only part left out was ""smoothing"" the leading edge of the hoof and creating the ""roll"" on the edge, once the hoof is leveled. I think that this is the easier part and can be gleaned from one of the books on natural hoof care. If you can borrow it, I would go that route, but if not and you have a bit of 'mad-money' and want to add to your collection, go for it!"
3,"Great Information, But...","First, I would like to state that this book is full of useful information; it is very well researched. The only fault, in my opinion, is that the book is at least twice as long as it needs to be. The author is frequently repetitious and wordy. Often, the information presented is too detailed to be of any use to the average reader. She should simply have indicated what to avoid and why. Also, it would perhaps have been helpful to include recipes for the 7-Day De-Sludge Diet; they're not particularly difficult menus, but it would have been nice. Overall, it's a worthwhile effort, and I would probably be interested to read her other book."
2,OK as far as it goes,"The hard part about .Net is its interactions with windows. Eg. To know that if you want to print a page with controls you need to know how to use WM_Print explcitly. With Petzold's background I was hoping to find this deeper info.Not so. It covers the pure .Net stuff pretty well and goes into all of the APIs in some depth, and it is probably the best book on the GUI side of .Net. But it does not address the hard stuff. (It is also a large book and a bit woffly.)So for the real documentation you have to search the news groups etc...(Be aware, only covers Windows/Forms API, not ASP, XML etc.)"
2,Check OReilly First,"Petzold's Programming Windows was the bible of VC++ development, but doesn't compare the condensed detailed information you'll find in OReilly books. Microsoft Press books are always full of fluff. As a rule of thumb look at OReilly first before buying anything from Microsoft Press.I don't work for OReilly. I have been a unix programmer for 15 years and a Microsoft programmer for about 3. The OReilly books are far superior in quality.Steve"
2,I was Petzold's student when started with C++ in 1992,"The book is very high level. Very shallow book. Good for beginners who would say after reading it:""WHAW! it so marvelous!"" not because they understand but more because they do not understand what had been tried to explained in this book. Not covering the depth of programming and concepts of C#. really does not worth time of reading it."
2,Totally bland.,"One would think that pairing up Roberto Roena and Adalberto Santiago would produce a masterpiece. Unfortunately, that is not the case with Super Apollo 47:50. Santiago's voice is powerful (as usual) but, the music is just not what you come to expect from the Apollo Sound. I don't know if it's the arrangements, the musicians or what but, it is just uninspiringly bland. You really won't get the hard hitting, salsa dura from the 70's. There is one HUGE exception on this album that saved it from becoming a total failure and that is ""Vigilandote."" This song is the epitamy of ""salsa gorda"" with fantastic hard hitting salsa combined with in your face lyrics and a vocal performance only Santiago can put on. Overall I really don't recommend this album, although you really should get a compilation album where ""Vigilandote"" is included. One of Roena's best songs ever."
2,"Couldn't get past the unlikely events to finish, quit in middle","Amazon provided enough of the storyline, so I'll just add my comments. The first half of the book is about a rescue during a snow storm that the hero takes her to a deserted inn. Of course no employees are to be found and it is also unlocked. I find this hard to believe. Wouldn't there be a maid left behind or a stable boy? The cook is gone, so is the owner. I just find it unbelievable the entire staff would have gone off to get provisions at the store and get trapped elswhere leaving everything open to be looted from if that should happen, but no, there are 2 couples who don't have the eye of the Ton on them and can behave how they want. I just couldn't get past this. The attraction didn't really feel that pronounced to be acted upon later and wasn't interested when it did happen. I can't say if it got better or not since I didn't finish."
5,Love these guys,I have been a fan for a long time. Neede this cd to add to my collection. You can't go wrong with this selection if you are a country fan.
5,Just WONDERFUL - listen on tape!!!!!!!,You much try to listen to this book on tape. I was so pleased with this book and its funny story. Listening to it helped since the character's English was not the best. Also there were many parts with singing and music!!! I was sooo into this book; it made the ride to school much easier.
1,Awful,"First and foremost his lyrics ... secondly his flow is wackif you liked the single-then buy this.. 'cause every song sounds JUST like itanyway, this guy is a fad-- here 2day gone 2morrow... this is one of those joints people will be embarassed to have bought"
3,"Dubs, Platinum, Ice, who the heck cares!?","THe only reason i gave this 3 stars is because the beats and tunes themselves are tight other than that the lyrics [is no good]. You get tired listening to a broken record about dubs, 20's, escalades, ice, platinum, cris, who...cares. Rap about something original!!!!! This guy is so fake, no wonder he's called a sell out, listen to what he raps about. He's purely in it for the bling bling and $$."
4,Pick this up!,"Nelly is new and awesome. I kow what your thinking that hes a one-hit wonder with Country grammar, but there are lots of nice songs on this cd. I would preview it first to make sure you like nelly in general, but i would definitely recommend picing this one up."
4,Country Grammer Rocks!,"When I bought the album ''Country Grammer'' I really didn't know what kind of artist Nelly was, but man oh man does he rock. He really puts that mood in rap, and this album just makes rap sound allot better then it is. Nelly is a really cool new artist and I can't wait till his second album comes out."
4,I like the old Nelly,"I'm not feelin the Get your eagleon-Shake Ya Tailfeather-gettin hot in herre Nelly but I am feelin this Nelly...Greed, Hate, Envy is my Nelly favorite , this is one of my favorite songs actually it's crazy...E.I. , Batter Up, Utha Side man all these songs is good...Nothin but good songs on this albumHe doesn't rap about buts gettin big or eagle's or any kind of birds at all not a single feather nowhere in this album so go buy"
2,"""Safe Rap""","i agree with blackdragon6 review whole heartedly.nelly is pop rap for the masses.when i say pop rap i mean pop rap as in bubble gum not popular.nelly has mainstream appeal he isn't harcore,he isn't overtly political,wich means he's easier on the ears of the suburbs.wich is cool cause thats where the money is i suppose.nelly beats are infectious no doubt but his lyrisicim leaves alot to be desired.i know theres more to rap then,revolutionery,gangsta,concious,political anti-establishment rants.BUT radio should never limit it self because of the powers that be sees rap as a threat.we should exsperience all of rap in its glory.not just safe candy a$$ rap.wich is all your getting from country grammer.."
2,it was for my daughter,"I am not a big fan, but my daughter is. She loves the cd. thanks for shipping it timely and the condition was what was expected. many thanks"
3,St. Loui ain't soo pooey!,"Nelly's freshman album is going to be up in the charts this summer. His rhyming is hot and he is somethin' different than the norm, but St. Louis is not a lot to rap about. Compared to the Cash Money Millionares, Nelly is hot with Country Grammer. His words are poetry to the hip hop dictionary, and he flows with every track. I would go out and make this purchase!"
4,Nelly Got It Tight!,"Nelly is the man! After many years of failed attempts of bustin out with his true rhymin, the man got it back! I done like none of his other cds, but this one, he hit gold. Especially with greed, hate , envy, my personal favorite track. This album off da hook so you gotta pick it up, right quick, dawgs! Uppper Brooklyn forevever! PEACE"
1,NELLY=SELLOUT.,"If you look in the dictionary for the word sellout you will see a picture of this fool in it.This cd is absolutely pure commercial garbage which should be burned.All of the songs have weak beats and this guy sounds like a fourth grader rapping.Its ironic that this album is called country grammar when he doesnt know anything about grammar or proper english with songs like ""tho dem wrappers"".I wonder if any of todays rappers even graduated from high school because they cant even talk right.Their hoods are in ruin but they could afford millions in jewelry.They dont care about their communities or anybody else for that matter.The black community should do something about this hip hop mess because its doing a disservice to their race.DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM."
5,Nelly,"This is definetly going to be the hottest cd ever! Nelly is definetly very talented, and i'm sure we will be hearing about him for a long time to come. Country Grammar is the best song on this cd, that song alone is worth your money!"
5,Paint match,"My wife had recently received a very nice antique brass floor lamp from her mother. Due to the age the lamp it needed to be rewired and the base needed some attention due to some rust on the surface. The base was made of iron which was the reason for the rust forming. After making some attempts locally to find a spray paint to closely match the aged brass part of the lamp, I gave up. Then I thought of Amazon and did a search inquiry and found this product. After receiving the product, I cleaned off the rust and applied a coat of paint. I found that this was as close as you can get to the look of aged brass using a spray paint. My wife and I both were very pleased with the results."
5,This is Candye at her Best,"First off, let's make it clear that Candye Kane is not some novelty act. While some folks like to focus more on her past and on her looks in reviewing her work, this is a serious vocalist with an exceptional backing band. There are few people on the planet who can belt out a song like Candye. Add to that, an allure that is hard to ignore and you have someone who makes great CDs and performs at unforgettable shows.Of all of her work this CD is by far the best. I don't think there is a weak cut on the entire album and most of these songs will either get your feet moving, put a smile on your face or at least get you to stop and reflect.While I would recommend anything she has ever recorded, this along with Diva La Grande are the perfect place to start in terms of appreciating her talent."
3,Lacking in many areas...,"Not a bad book, gives some decent advice on care. But it leaves out information on a lot of things. It doesn't even mention that there are differences between hunting and showing lines, and actually makes no mention of hunting except to say that Goldens were once used for hunting. With hunting being such a big part of the Golden Retriever's history (not to mention modern life), it should've gotten a bigger mention. Also, the training section was very simplistic."
2,Hyped and unreadable,"Political science professors and analysts play an important role in society by helping to explain the political process and its relevance to our everday lives -- but only when they make their readings and thoughts available to lots of people and not just a select few who understand their language.Ted Lowi's book, ""The End of Liberalism,"" seems to have been written for hard-core political junkies who are accustomed to reading ""unreadable books."" Mr. Lowi's book is also an outstanding example of terrible writing -- run-on sentences, obscure vocabulary, passive sentences, etc. This book doesn't help anyone understand the political process because it is too difficult to figure out.I do not recommed reading this book unless you have lots of time on your hands and are willing to take on a headache and lots of frustration."
1,Worst Purchase I've ever made,I think this camera is the worst camera I've ever seen. It looks metal but it's made from cheap plastic. The flash is terrible and the quality of the picture is horrendous. Do not buy this product.
1,NOT WORTH IT,PICTURE QUALITY FOR A 3 MEGAPIXEL CAMERA IS VERY DISAPPOINTING! THE ONLY GOOD THING IS ITS SMALL SIZE. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA FOR ANYTHING BUT A CHILDS TOY AND AT THE SELLING PRICE IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THAT.
5,This is one of their best albums!,"I have to correct what the previous reviewer said. Actually Triumphant return was released in late e 1989. Hammer and Nail was released in 1988. Anyway, this is a very strong Whitecross album. They came to play Bethel Temple in Hampton in May 1990 touring for Triumphant Return. I still have the poster from that show signed and framed. The music is like any given commercial metal band of the day, but their shows were outstanding. The musicianship was top notch. If I can recommend any Whitecross album to the new listener, I would strongly suggest Triumphant Return, along with Hammer and Nail, and the Debut. The 1st 3 rock the hardest."
4,Best guide to take with on the trail,There is a lot Rubicon Trail material in the web but this must be best trail guide to have with you when travelling to rubicon. Handy size. All essential you need. You want to have this book with you when driving the trail. [...]
2,tedious - not one of Jeck's best,"I am a huge fan of this series, but not of this book. It seemed to take a departure from others in the series in several ways. It spent much time on philosophical issues like marriage, friendship, taking lives, etc. If i wanted that, I wouldn't be reading mysteries. Even his foreword is long and tedious! And one of his steadfast characters reveals a major character flaw, which I found very disheartening, and quite odd after 15+ novels. A long and unsatisfying book."
4,Sex in the 14th century,"I've read several other books by Michael Jecks, but this was the first one that talked so much about sex and sexual customs. It also kept me guessing throughout the story. I had also never heard of the Scilly Isles. I actually went and looked them up and saw photos of them. This made reading the story all the more interesting. As always the people were interesting and the mystery engrossing."
1,Another horrifying Madonna tribute album,"Madonna, please tell these record companies that put out bad tribute albums to you (particularly San Juan Recordings) to stop! Honestly, almost every Madonna ""tribute"" album, with the exception of the string quartet one, sucks. Big time. So, if I were you, and if I wanted a good tribute CD, I'd buy the String Quartet Tribute to Madonna. It has beautiful strings, violins, and cellos, without any nasty vocal performances to spoil the songs."
3,Great kata reference,"This is a very good, comprehensive reference to all the wado kata, which occupies the bulk of the text. The first 20% of the book has a number of passages reflecting Otsuka's views on different aspects of budo and life in general. I suspect something is lost in the translation here because some of it is a difficult read, but there are pearls of wisdom in there. Some of it displays a simple and straightforward view of life in the context of budo, which is interesting.The sections on technique make some disappointing omissions. I'm not sure why this seems so lightly covered, I had hoped for more technical references.Still, you absolutely need a kata reference while learning and practicing, and I can't imagine a better one to have."
2,"Um, well, you know, good effort and all, but...","Okay. I've got all the Newsboys' cds, and I'm here to let you know this is the worst. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because I absolutely adore the band photo. For any Newsboys fans who have not seen Peter Furler with BIG POOFY LONG HAIR, get the cd just to see the picture. It's worth it.The music stinks. But hey, let's face it, it was recorded for the most part in the 80's, so, you can't expect it to be perfect.Overall, the answer is no. DO NOT BUY THIS CD. I don't know what you've got to be taking to think it's good, because it's not. As a Christian music and Newsboys collector, this was the last Newsboys cd I bought, and thankfully so. It was nowhere near worth the money.Truthfully, I LOVE THE NEWSBOYS. But even their first cd, Read All About It, is better than this one."
4,prety good,this overol was a great cd i just dont nkow if i like the 80's stuff but this is prety good the reason i cant giv it 5 stares is the styl of music
5,My favorite book ever!,"I've read this book at least thirty times, taking my dog-eared and yellowed copy along on every business trip and vacation. It's not only fun to read, it's highly literate - improve your english SAT score in only one reading!Warning! After reading this book you'll never again be able to walk through your living room without feeling pangs of embarassment at all the class indicators present."
4,"Wry, insightful and prescient, though self-indulgent.","As a newly prosperous young professional, I thrilled in this book's guided tour up and down our American class ladder. Outrageously funny, you'll need a thick skin not to take umbrage at times. I am still ashamed to learn that expensive technical wrist-watches imply horrible middle class status. Probably, most Americans will find discouraging this book's teaching that one's class is inherited at birth, with little or no recourse to change it (an exception being marriage up or down). As noted elsewhere, the final chapter of the book, ""The X Way Out"", is a throwaway paeon to bohemians like the author. Though written in the early 1980's, Fussell's observations are almost all still pertinent. Contrast this book's thorough review with the staid marxist tropes in a recent (2005) New York Times series, and you you'll have a clear idea from which class the Times has been hiring, lately."
3,Cranky Old Man Longs For The Values Of His Youth,"Fussell is an English professor at UPENN, but for this book he masquerades as a social historian. If you think ""Mr. Timothy's Worst Dressed List"" is amusing (e.g. her outfit looks like a plastic trash bag with arm-holes), you'll think this is ""witty"". The views are out-dated, inconsistent and backed by nothing other than the author's personal tastes which seem to have been formed circa 1950. Now and then he hits the mark, but ""pink lawn flamingos"" are an easy and cheap shot - his snide, mean-spirited delivery makes it hard to enjoy what could at least be an entertaining if not rigorous attempt. Think American Idol's Simon Cowell commenting on a somewhat broader array of topics and you'll have the picture."
3,3 stars because it is too short,"The video is well done, and beautifully photographed, as you'd expect from Natl Geographic. It is very educational as far as what people actually do on the Haj. I had thought the walking round the Kaaba was the climax but not so. Short, but good insight into something most non-muslims would never have the chance to see."
3,Does not show you the true feeling of Hajj,"It is not that bad, but I think that they could have made it 10 times better. I know I've been there during Hajj.It goes thru the process really quickly without stoping and explaining each process. It was skimming thru evrything. Maybe they had time constraints! Nevertheless, if someone wants to have an idea of hajj then it is not that bad as I said earlier."
4,green book,"well alot of people saying this is the best cd that they put out. although it is not the best but is VERY good. Alot of deep songs in it. it's based out of twiztid's eyes rather than the juggalos(fans). Twiztid has NEVER came out with one bad cd. Ignore Icp(even though they are on the album). This group is underrate and looked down on them becasue they are associated with icp. so that's what i mean by ignoring them. Alot of songs are good but just like every album you buy,you get one or two that [aren't good]. so check this out you'll like it."
2,"Green Book, Shangri-La, and Repentance","Twiztid did the Green Book. This was a collection of more personal songs. That's why it's very different.It's very different from other Twiztid CDs.For one, it's very off/odd when Psychopathic make sad songs. I thought all of their good songs can be played live. When you listen to good Psychopathic, you don't leave depressed.What sucks truly sucks about The Green book. It's all the hype. The hype was better than the CD itself.It's got a couple of really good songs on it though. Marsh Lagoon is a hell of a good song. That song and the artwork/booklet is the reason you should buy this CD. It's too depressing."
2,Boring,"Written by someone for whom English is a second language. Talks about himself and other inconsequential stuff, blows through the scenery and the nature of the country he's in, and has got a lot of misinformation that he never checked out to see if it was accurate. Don't waste your time or money."
4,Pretty good book,"A well-written book, really helped kick my winter blues, wanting to hit the trail. My only complaint is that the majority of the book takes place during his desert portion of the trip. I figured he would spend more time on his experiences in the high country of the Sierras, my favorite place in the world! The Sierras were only a small segment of the story, and although I enjoy the desert just as much as the next guy (I happen to live in it), I would have found the book more interesting had he elaborated on his time from Death Valley to the Oregon border."
5,No fuss.. big lashes,These are a great bargain.. lots less than buying one pair at a time when you want your eyes to pack a big PUNCH in public without shouting mascara.. you can even cut one in half for normal days to look great without shouting.. HEY I HAVE MAKEUP ON when going to the store etc... rock on Model 21!
4,I never read it but it's SO CUTE!,"Who can resist those puppy dog eyes on the cover? Hopefully the kids at the elementary school library will be thrilled with this new addition. The librarian requested it, so it must be AWESOME."
5,Pres. Reagan is my hero,This is a great collection and a must have for Reagan fans. What a larger than life character he was. The funeral process pictured in this DVD was indeed sad but one gets to appreciate the fact that people of different backgrounds came together to say thanks & good-bye to this man. This DVD is so powerful that I kept thinking about it for days after watching it. It's a great collection to my Reagan related DVDs and books. This is a timeless tribute to my hero.
2,Ready for Radio,"After ""Live to Die"" and ""Silence is Madness"" I had high exceptions for the new Bride album of my favorite Christian Heavy Metal band at the time. What happento the speed metal...gone...no screaming vocals.Was this a change to a more commercial metal or Hard Rock?Oh NOOOO... Bride changed styles here {even the cool cover art stuff was gone.}This is still a metal album at times but mostly Hard Rock with a couple of good songs likeTroubled times, Ski Mask, Everybody Knows My Name.Great vocals, lyrics are excellent,Songs with lots of hooks,This album would and did appeal to an even wider audience than the first Few Bride albums.If you like commercial Hard Rock {Aerosmith} you will like this.After all these years with this CD I never play it.Man, I was so bummed about this CD at that time I only bought a tape of the next Bride album."
1,The book is a big disappointment to me,"First of all is too wordy and repetitive. Second, Didn't help me at all. Didn't give real life situations and what to do. Just tells you to be happy, do this, don't think negatively or selfishly, etc. I already know this. I thought the book will contain many examples and stories and explain to us the best way to deal with each of 'em. Last but not least, the book rarely mention the words: 'best friend'."
5,Sweet story and lovely fuzzy illustrations,"This was one of my favorite books to read to my children when they were tiny. The illustrations are lovely, the story is simple and easy to follow, and nicely written. The children get to learn and make animal sounds as the little lamb meets different farm animals. The kicker for my children were the fuzzy parts on each page. They loved to touch the ""wool"" or ""fur."" This tactile element seemed to help them pay attention to the book when they were very young.I got the book as a gift, then bought other copies to give as gifts."
5,"In a sense, is more valuable than many contemporary books on CART","For me, this 1984-issued monograph is more valuable than many contemporary books on CART (I actually read the 1983 edition with gold & brown hardcover, but the contents is the same). The reason is that it shows the tortuous, painstaking trial and error process of creating and adjusting CART methodology.Therefore, if your goal is to learn yet another statistical recipe quickly, this book is not for you. If, on the other hand, you want to pick up some of the research methodology of the great quantitative modelers, I can highly recommend it. It will positively affect your thinking and, in the end, you will be able to tackle quantitative problems a lot better, be it with or without CART."
3,OK...but far from perfect,"While the features overall are pretty neat and this is a nice, compact design that is perfect for a night stand, I am finding that for a bedroom alarm clock it doesn't work so well. I thought that the ""HiGlo(tm)"" back-lighting was always on, making it easy enough to read in the dark, but that is not the case. The back lighting only comes on after fumbling to find one of the ""touch technology"" buttons that, of course, are also not lit up. For a desk clock, this would be perfect. For a bedside clock, find one that is visible in the dark..."
1,oregon scientific weather radio,"Piece of garbage. Speakers are like toys. Reception is awfull.Impossible to operate. Packed in sealed container. After cutting open package and finding I am not satisfied, could not return. Do not buy this product!"
3,Pretty good device....,"The soft touch buttons makes it too easy to turn the radio and or change the snooze timer from 8min to 25 mins which I am constantly hitting by accident. The back light doesn't stay on times out in 1 min. If need to see the time in the middle of the night you have to hit one of those sensitive buttons to light the clock on. However, you may want total darkness in the bedroom at night. It takes sometime getting use to the buttons. Fortunately. the clock and alarm requires more to setup. I do like that I can get a quick look at the inside temp and outside temp especially during the cold winter. I think this may be the best feature of it all. Radio station works well..The alarm has two alarm options one is a beeping sound and the other is the radio. The beeping sound is not so loud so if sound sleeper than this may be to lite of a sound...All in all the clock/radio/alarm/wheather station is an ok device."
1,Use a KNIFE if it's too deep,"If your cake is too deep for a toothpick, use a thin knife.This is an excellent example of wastefulness"
3,Buy it to hear Joe 90,"I bought this CD after eagerly anticipating a new Joe 90 CD (saw them in concert w/ Counting Crows 1/21/00 in St. Louis). Great song. Very different from their CD ""Dream This"". I am also very fond of the new Duncan Sheik on the CD. Surprisingly, my favorite song is BBQ by 2 Skinny J's. This is a rap-type song about a Bar-B-Que. It is hilarious and kind of sticks with you.All in all, as far as soundtracks go, this one is pretty easy to listen to. I would recommend buying it. If nothing else, just to check out Joe 90 & the BBQ song!"
4,Good,"I enjoyed this book... although it was not the greatest of Jean Plaidy's books. I just didn't get attached to Richard II or Henry IV... although I did like Catherine Swyford, but that was because I had read Anya Seton's novel... It was not as good as The Vow on the heron, but it's still fun to read."
1,FAKE!!,"I was so excited to see this on Amazon. I went ahead and ordered it (good thing I didn't order two like I wanted to) Anyhow first the box is wrong. Original box for Noa came in TWO pieces. ( As recently as 6 months ago, as I bought a few in Toronto) This box came in one piece. Second as soon as you spray it on you it smells like alcohol. And for any of you who don't know FAKE perfum typically smells like that. It smells NOTHING like the other THREE bottles I have ( I like to stock up as this perfum is so hard to find). I would def return if I could, but because it's open I can't. Please don't buy it is DEF FAKE! =-/"
5,Great bag,Made in U.S.A. The ziploc feature is smart: keeps air completely sealed within and without. I use this bag to seal precious garments in cedar wood blocks to protect from moth feasts.
3,piece of mind,The vendor was accurate in description and fast in delivery and the product works fine
2,it wasn't the book i was dissapointed in! I couldn't read,"I was really dissapointed when I was reasearching to find that to get the right info, you have to buy the actual book. what happended to finding simple info without spending money--these days the internet is such a joke! I can't even find info on my topic! I really wish if you advertise you could at least give a one page interpretation. I need the real stuff!--"
3,Decent,"I was a nice overview of the the history of Bigfoot in the southern states. One thing I wished to correct is that the TBRC (Texas Bigfoot Research Conservancy), despite the fact that I believe the video indicates differently, now has a, ""pro-kill"" stance regarding Bigfoot. Any discrepancy may be related to the fact that the documentary was produced several years ago, while it is my understanding that the TBRC has just altered there position recently. If true, I will no longer associate with the TBRC, or support their endeavors."
1,boring,I really wanted to like this doco..buts its just so tedious and boring..real shame actually..
5,It's a Strategic Asset!,"I recently accepted a marketing position at a community bank and one of the first books my boss asked me to read was this one - Dreamweaving. This has been one of the most eye opening marketing/communication stratagies that I have seen or heard of in a long time! It makes sense, is simple, and can be the most strategic asset for your bank or business. Dreamweaving builds an emotional bridge between your business and the community. It allows you to focus on the relationship with people first, and then the product. I think that we have placed too much emphasis on the product and that banking/business marketing is the 'same old thing!' Everyone already knows that your bank has checking accounts and CD's - why bother telling them? Invest your time (and money) into relationships. This book is a MUST for anyone and everyone who has a business and wants it to genuinely stand out from the rest - we're talking Top of Mind Awareness!"
3,Not very attractive but true to the Georgia Bulldog Logo,"This ring is very true to the Georgia Bulldog logo.However, if you are looking for a more attractive, artistic ring that would be great for fans of bulldogs in general (including bulldog mascot fans of any kind), I recommend checking out the ring selection at [...]He has animal rings of several kinds - all available in sterling silver."
5,The Wouldbegoods,"I am one of six children, I am the oldest and our last name is BASTABLE, I have to read this book."
4,Cool Jazz,"Enjoyable CD that is well suited for pilates or yoga, driving in a car, or just trying to relax. Smooth"
4,focus on essentials,"Heiman offers a concise overview of what is useful in statistic, with an emphasis for the reader who is majoring in the behavioural sciences. There is no proving of theorems or lemmas, like there would be in a book for maths majors. Instead, the text starts at an elementary level, describing various types of graphs. Along with metrics like the mean, median and standard deviation. Hopefully, you've also encountered this in high school.It goes more advanced from there. Always geared towards relevancy if you are designing an experiment. Often with human subjects. Hence there are issues of sampling from an underlying population. This should be a random sample, and there is an associated sampling error.ANOVA and Chi square tests are covered. For many situations with multiple independent variables, these are very useful."
4,Easy to Understand,"Although this subject was difficult for me, this book was written very well. The authors did a good job with making this book ""user-friendly""."
4,very good for the price,The book is a little old and faded but Anno's USA is just as fascinating and wonderful. A great replacement when you have lost a cherished book.
2,Good Cd,"I love this cd, he is so, bomb, it he as great rap singles, and he looks really good, he as really grat songs on his first cd, and i love this cd, it is the truth, to the fullest."
1,there's better feirce french rock,"After I got into Rammstein I decided to look for more feirce Europeaen rock bands so I found this band, but this CD doesn't make any sense. It's just the same drum beat over and over. There aren't even really choruses, it's all just dumb noises. The guy keeps going ""aaaa"" in a French accent and it really gets on my nerves.If you look at the songs in audacity you can see the whole envelope! How could they ship this CD out if it's not even produced? Definitely pass this."
4,confused,when I order this product I believe that was bigger according to the description but it was a 24square inches not giant!!!!
2,FLIMSY FOOD COVER,I bought this food cover thinking it would hold up in slighty drafty area. It was in my backyard. I had a barbeque and needed the largest food cover possible. Yes it did cover what I needed covered but the slightest wind blew it off the food and into my pool. I do not recommend this product for any windy areas. If you do buy this product I suggest you reinforce the edges to hold it down.
2,Opportunity Lost,"What could have been compared to what we got. A great opportunity was lost. Having that much talent assembled and watering down the performances was a big misfire. Where was performances from Lazy Lester, Jimmy Vaughn? Was Clapton invited. Instead we got Steven Tyler, Macy Gray, Joe Perry and a host of other performers that do not connect with the Blues.Performers like Cray, Burke & many others were matched with songs that felt awkward. As a long time devoted blues fan, Martin, I appreciated what you tried to do, you just did not do it very well. C minus when it should have been an A plus."
3,Beige - Ein Königreich Für Eine Handgranate,"Beige might have to have a genre named for him specifically. Let's call it clickdubjazzfunk. On his second album _Ein Königreich Für Eine Handgranate_, he abstracts elements of all of them, blending them into something altogether fascinating. The double bass of ""Doesn't Hurt (Even If You Try)"" gets overlaid with some odd wobbly synths for a bizarre experience that somehow works. The rhythms on the album stay firmly clicking away, even as the cut-up vocals on ""Where Else -- If Not There"" give way to a what-the-heck-is-this reaction. ""Dreams"" employs a tootling recorder to provide some additional texture, while ""Gosh! 48 Channels"" gets some light electro, augmented by some nice strings in the middle section. The funky horns on ""Wonzo's Erster Tag"" give an illusion of fullness in what is otherwise a very spare track. An odd listening experience, but rewarding nonetheless."
4,very cute,Bought these as a gift. The material is soft as I would have expected and they appear to be well made. Time will tell how they hold up.
2,Might Make a Good Movie,"After reading Bastard out of Carolina, Cavedweller was a big disappointment. The book is teeming with characters that leave you yearning for more--more information, more resolution, more anything!Nonetheless, I think it would be interesting to see it adapted to the big screen (not t.v. though as it would lend itself to the Lifetime Television for Women genre all too easily). On the big screen some of the more extraneous characters could fade into the background and there's a a lot to be done with the cave scenes.If a film were made, maybe I could finally say that I liked a movie better than the book it was based on!"
2,enjoyable,"Enjoyable novel about relationships between women, as friends and family members. The characters are a bit on the stereotypical side, but it's worth reading."
3,Close but no cigar,"I agree with the comments about editing by other reviewers. I found it very disturbing that I dropped $20.00 for this book and there were such blatant editing (or lack thereof) errors. Clint called Cliff, Cissy called Cindy. Penguin books should be ashamed of themselves. The story was intriguing, but didn't seem to go anywhere. As a first draft, I would be impressed. As a big fan of ""Bastard Out of Carolina"" I'm not so much disappointed in Allison but in her editors."
3,Well written but too sprawling,"So many plots, so little development. The main problem I had with ""Cavedweller"" is that there are so many characters and relationships with stories that are vaguely sketched out for the reader but never fully explored. Some authors can introduce background characters in a way that you can appreciate them on the basis of one scene, but Allison never manages to do that. Maybe because nearly all the characters don't have real world counterparts outside of trailer parks in the deep south."
2,Chaise cushion,Cushion a little narrow and not soft.Would be better if made with tufts and not so many sections.Ties are not easy to secure.
1,Grease in the box,When I received my book it had grease all over it and in the box. i wiped it off but it stained my book. i took pictures of this but don't no where to send them to complain.
3,Could have been better,"Okay, the content of the book was excelent. My question was why did not the authors of the book have a some executables on the CD. If someone has found a way to compile the source then please send me a copy or info on how you did it. thanks. contact: kaber0111@hotmail.com"
3,Good for beginners but outdated,"Good if you are just starting, the explanations are clear and it is fun reading. The drawback is that it is outdated, the sport has evolved so much that probably it requires a fresher look. Also it doesn't contain much material for intermediate and advanced windsurfers."
5,Using Space Efficiently,To me the wide open space under the kitchen sink has always been such a waste. This now let's you organize in multiple shelves all the things that seem to collect under the sink. I liked this in the kitchen so much I ordered it for the under the bathroom sinks.
1,"can we say ""kaka doody""?","If I had purchased this for $2 it would have been maybe ok- but it was so flimsy, seems to have pieces missing & had no insert/instructions- it was a HUGE disappointment. I could have gone to a one dollar store & bought a few plastic boxes to stow my stuff in & stack under the sink & it would be way better than this monstrosity- zero stars!!! KAKA-DOODY!"
3,"Not great, not bad","I read quite a few negative reviews before ordering this, but I figured I would give it a try.All in all, it's not a BAD product - and considering the problem it's trying to solve, you have to give it some credit. The space under a sink is a ridiculously shaped area. With pipes, deep bowel sinks, disposals, etc, things quickly get out of control under there.The Madesmart Expandable Under sink Shelf Organizer will give you some sort of organization, but be prepared that you could also lose some usable space at the same time. If you have a deep sink bowl, it's almost impossible to use this organizer, because even at it's shortest and least wide setting, it most likely will still be too large."
3,A Collection of all Selena's English Recordings,"This collection is really not Selena's greatest hits but a collection of English recordings. This album does offer some beautiful ballads like ""Only Love"" and ""Where did The Feeling Go"" and then also offers some uptempo tracks like ""Is it The Beat?"" or ""A boy Like That."" But what pulls this album down is the lack of thought and effort put into this album. It doesn't seem like a tribute or even a look back on what Selena would have become but more like whoever put together this album is trying to gain money and live off of Selena's image."
2,Not Absolutely the Best,"I purchased ""Absolutely the Best"" for my two favorite songs: Light My Fire and Feliz Navidad. I was very disapointed that Feliz Navidad is not the original song, but a ""live"" recording. Had that been disclosed, I would not have purchased the cd."
2,Depressing!,"I enjoy New Order, and thought I'd take a chance on an album by Joy Division.Man, is this stuff ever depressing. I glad they ditched the singer and turned up the synths!"
5,"One of the most important, influential albums of all time","From the opening track, Atrocity Exhibitions, where Ian Curtis beckons 'this is the way, step inside' on a swirling, mysterious number, this album is something quite out of the ordinary. Totally unlike anything New Order did after it, this is full of gothic songs with subtle, swirling guitar, ominous, pounding drums and loud, dark basslines. Isolation displays the electronic sounds that were to follow with New Order, but in a far darker song, while the last 4 tracks are even better than the first 4: 'Heart and Soul' a classic, dark song; The Eternal a slow, unfolding track and Decades an unnerving closer.Without this albums, as so many others will tell you, no Nine Inch Nails. No Tool. No so many modern bands. An ominous, tortured album which was recorded shortly before Curtis' suicide. Absolutely essential."
3,Pictures of figures you'll never find,"If you collect slu's and are fed up with never finding any, you might like this book as a refernce. The pictures are excellent and you can finally find out what the older figures look like. The prices listed at the bottom of each figure are a nice touch. Still, the figures are only worth what they are worth to you. A secondary dealer can charge whatever he wants and you are pretty stuck if you want the figure. If you are like me, you are waiting for this market to bottom out. I do recommend the book for the visuals though."
1,Part 1?,Is this 'Part 1' thing a joke? The whole season has six episodes!How about 6 'parts'? Or 7? One just with the commercials.Not buying it.
2,"Weak follow up to Skin Deep, Blood Red","I truly liked Mr. Skinner's first fictional novel - Skin Deep, Blood Red - and was so disappointed by his second entry into the mystery field. The premise of the book is good but it just never gets to any real intrigue or edge of the seat suspense. Mr. Skinner has great characters -they just don't seem to mesh together. And some of the scenes have no relationship to believability. Perhaps, this one was just too much an attempt to produce book #2 too soon. Wesley Farrell was a great character developed in book #1 and I was truly disappointed by his character in book #2. And if I knew a woman's liber, I would not recommend this book to her because the role of women was insulting and demeaning. Better luck next time - bring back Mr. Farrell with all his charm and mystic of book #1."
4,Great Book,"We read a condensed version of this book in class. I really enjoyed it. I really cared about the characters. It also had good basketball elements; the games were very descriptive. Ed Sorrell was one of the greatest characters I have read in a long time. It's not just a basketball book: It also has great characters. Even though it was published in '58, it's pretty much timeless. I felt most of the book was relavent today. I definitely reccomend it to anyone who is looking for a good book."
5,Hard to put down,"This was an excellent read. Made the reader feel like they were right there on the survivor boats and knew what they were going through during this very tragic and traumatic time. Once I got involved, it was very hard for me to put the book down. Would recommend it to anyone who is interested in info about the sinking of the Titanic."
2,CAN'T BE STERILIZED!,"I ordered this tubing through Amazon, sold by SCS collectibles (also made by Aerobile per packaging). It is not in Medela packaging but a clear bag (see picture of product from Aerobile). I have not even opened it, but I can read the instructions through the bag that specifically say ""DO NOT clean the tubing using steam or boiling water. Washable with cold water."" I realize that the tubing is not supposed to be in contact with the milk, but I would feel much better if I could sterilize it as the Medela instructions say. Not sure exactly what material this tubing is made of, it looks like the regular tubes that come with the pump. I'm going to return them anyhow and pay the extra couple of bucks for the ones from Medela!"
3,"Not Medela nor ""BY MEDELA""","The item works as advertised. It arrived in a factory sealed package, but it is not made by Medela. Amazon should not list this item as ""BY MEDELA"""
3,GOT IT FOR FREE!,"Great reviews! Thank you for letting me know I could call Medela and get it for free. Just did without hassle! June 17, 2010"
1,DO NOT BUY TUBING,"Call Medela, #800-435-8316 and hit 0, tell them you need new tubing. The first time I tried I had someone tell me its $19.99. I decided to try again, got a different person. She told me the same thing but I told her I thought it was a free replacement. She asked me how long I have had it, I said my son is six months old (indirectly answering her question). She said she would make a one time exception! I will have it by the end of the week!"
1,be careful - not all sellers here are selling genuine Medela tubing,"I ordered ""Medela"" tubing from a seller here. What I got was a cheap Chinese knockoff with no UPC code, name or any other info on the package. The color of the plastic tubing ends did not exactly match the other Medela items, either.Be sure to read seller's feedback before ordering."
1,WARNING WHEN ORDERING THIS PRODUCT!!!,"BEWARE!!! Despite the listing specifically stating (with pictures and instructions!) it is for the new PIS and PIS Advanced AND the picture being exactly what I needed, I received incorrect tubing. The tubing I received was for the First Issue PIS Advanced, Symphony, Lactina, and Classic Breastpump with double adaptors. Also, even though the listing stated it was shipped by Medela when I bought the item, it was sent from a store that was just an individual's name and was not in Medela packaging. May not be an issue for some, but this is important to me and why I ordered from Medela instead of paying less from another store."
3,Tricky to sterilize,I bought these to replace the original ones that came with my medela pump. They seem to melt at certain points when I use the medela microsteam bags. The instructions state to cover the tubeswith water but the 4 oz don't quite cover both tubes. I try to make sure the tube tips do not touch any part of the plastic tubing when steaming them but that is quite difficult at times. They still work though despite the holes.
1,not the right fit,this does not fit all medela pump in style advanced pumps like it says!!!!got the tubes which don't fit my pump and now I am stuck with tubes I can'tuse.
1,Disgusting!,"The tubing arrived today for my Medela Pump in Style. I was terribly disappointed in the packaging as there were pieces of hair wrapped around the tubing. Furthermore, both tubes looked as though they had been used. Overall, it looks a little too unsanitary to use even if I were to sterilize. Gross! So disappointed!"
1,Got them for free from Medela customer support,I just called 800-435-8316 - press 0 for the operator and ask for customer support - Told them I wanted to order replacement tubing and was transferred to customer service. They verified the correct tubing for the pump I have and said they will promptly send it to me in the mail at AT NO COST. Just call them...
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"I bought these tubes because they were advertised as Medela brand tubes. These tubes are NOT made by Medela, but in fact, made in Taiwan by AeroBile, LLC. I read the reviews posted here that said Medela was giving free replacement tubes, but I had no luck with that, so I decided to order them here instead, thinking I was still getting Medela brand tubes."
3,The delivery was delayed over two weeks ...,"I had to contact the seller (not Amazon)many times because two stools with the estimated delivery time, July 6 through July 11, were not delivered within the time frame. After a several e-mails to the seller, the two stools were delivered separately one week apart - I just received the second stool July 30. The seller at least responded my e-mails promptly. As for the stools, they look o.k.for the price, but some of the screws and bolts that assemble the parts are visible, which reduces the attractiveness of the products. Assembling was not difficult,despite an error in the instructions about which screws to be used in Step 1/2."
4,"Great value, good price!",Very reasonable cost. The navigation is a bit difficult at first. But overall its a great buy!
1,Looks best on the store shelf.,"I got this backpack over the internet with high-hopes. My mistake, I should have got one in my hands before dropping the money. For light use it would probably be great, but given its capacity I don't feel it is designed for light use. Straps have broken, plastic fasteners have broken and the bottom worn thin, then wore out way too quickly.The front pocket and middle pocket hang loose inside the main compartment making any sort of retieval from the main compartment difficult if other pockets are even moderatly filled. This goes for camping or classroom activities.In all, I should have gotten the standard 2-compartment Eastpack.If you buy this I hope you have better luck than I did."
3,Gift to son,"My son had asked for this for a Christmas gift. He is 40 years old and loves Nash Bridges. However, he said the full first series was not included and was disappointed in the DVD. Doesn't deter me, I will get him the second series that comes out on Mar 3 to see if that is any better."
5,It's About Time!,"All I can say is ""it's about time!"" My family and I have been waiting for this show to come out on DVD ever since it went off the air. Where else can you find the charisma of Don Johnson and the coolness of Cheech Marin? I've always been a huge Don Johnson fan - from the days of Miami Vice (yes, I have all those DVD's!) to Nash Bridges - and all the movies in between. Nash Bridges was an entertaining show, unlike most of the shows from the last few years. It's a classic and I can't wait until October!"
5,Great Show!!,This is such great news! I have been waiting for this release for years. I can not wait for October 14th so I can finally buy this!!!
2,Incomplete,"This book is interesting, but not complete. It does not include all the attacks by the Zebra killers. I felt that it was more of a biography of the SFPD and detective Earl Sanders."
1,Not the real story!,"I recommend that you read the ORIGINAL ""Zebra"" by Clarke Howard. THAT is the TRUE story, taken from transcripts, police reports, etc. Sanders was not the lead inspector on this case, and seems to be taking credit where it is NOT due. He was being trained at the time by the real lead inspectors, and is attempting to pass himself off as the one that solved the case, which he is not. It is shameful that someone would try to take credit for a case which he did not actually solve. If you want the real story, written by an independent author, get your hands on the book by Clarke Howard. This is merely the author's attempt at unwarranted self promotion."
1,"VERY Good Story, ROTTEN Amazon ""information"" . . .","This series was a very good and interesting take on Vampire comics by Judd Winick. I only have two qualms with it, and only one of those is what forced the 1 star rating . . . The first one, is that Winick was reported as saying he wanted to be the First to give vampires an update, or some such, in the Vertigo universe. This totally ignores the Vertigo ""Vamps"" series, from which only 2 short story arcs (out of a project 5 or 6 I think) were ever released (and only the first of those collected, I think), but were also quite good.The big problem, is that this collected edition, now listed by Amazon as out of print, was NEVER RELEASED!!!!!!!!!I waited well over a year for the thing after the projected release date . . . waiting and waiting for the release . . . it never was . . . and now they have the nerve to list it as ""Out of Print.""Arghhhhhhhhhh!Pretty good story, SOMEONE at Vertigo, PLEASE PRINT IT IN A COLLECTED EDITION LIKE YOU PROMISED!!!!!!!"
2,cactus jack b4 hardcore,this dvd is 1 hr longim not gonna lie to u its not that great i bought it for 5 dollars with steve austin early years that is kinda worth it he austin is worse he is a jobber so what are u gonnan expect there is 12 matches in 5 4 mins so it is destened to be bad if i were u id buy some other cheap dvd this but if ur a person like me u would buy it bc i buy mostly buy every dvd or vhs so the choice is urs girls and guyssincerlyLDL
1,STOP! Don't buy this brush!!!!,"This is a terrible pool brush! IMMEDIATELY upon first use we ran into our 1st problem. I thought I wouldn't have the troubles other reviewers have mentioned...I was wrong! The clip (where it attaches to the pole) does NOT work. My hubby made a ""work-around"" fix so we could use the brush, so I thought, ok we can make this work. Hold on, I'm not done, it gets worse before it gets better. The bristles fall out (all without me even noticing or being aware). So when we go to check the filter baskets, WHAT A MESS. There are bristles all mucked up in the filter baskets, causing havoc on our system. So I repeat DON'T buy this thing, it will cost you far more than you'll save! A super stupid purchase on our part."
5,Sweet Li Hing Mui,"I was just shopping Amazon one day and happened to notice the food link and thought I would try to see if they had one of my favorite hard to find snacks. Happily I found Sweet Li Hing Mui and other delicacies from China. I ordered this and was excited to see if it lived up to my expectations. The order was shipped within days and I received my package bubble wrapped and tasting fresh , I was surprised how fresh it was. I will definitely try ordering again when I need to have my snacks."
4,OK! The CD is the same of the picture,This is the debut album of Orphaned Land.A great work of this band of Israel with Oriental influences.The only thing to complain about the booklet is poor.
2,"face it, they're done","O.k., let's face it. Iron Maiden's last great albumwas Powerslave. Since then, it has been a steadydecline. This album is o.k. at best. Bruces recent solostuff is way better. There are about 3 average songson this. I guess that's better than nothing, but still sad.Maybe if they got rid of that tool of a third guitarist,they could get back to business.Time to hang it up."
5,Vintage!,"The songs are great, Dickinson is in shape, and the songwriting is always strong, typical of Iron Maiden.Just like the albums 1980's, Brave New World has its own style and adds to the impressive collection of this band.If you listen to it often enough, you can feel that this album is the next logical step after the Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son record from 1988. The four albums in between were... not the real Iron Maiden.Brave New World is a strong offering from the first to the last track. The Wicker Man stands out of the pack with its amazing rhythm and it will be a great concert song!"
4,Great return for Bruce!,This is a great way for Bruce to return to Maiden. This album contains some phenomenal songs (i.e.-Blood Brothers and Ghost of The Navigator). Anyone who gave up on Maiden once Bruce left needs to pick this album up and give it a thorough listen- you will not be disappointed!
2,Not my type...,"So you say this is a classic Iron Maiden... It doesn't do much for me, no matter how much I love Iron Maiden. Why?... The songs are too slow, too long, too repetitive and over-produced. The only tracks I like here are ""The Wickerman"", ""Ghost Of The Navigator"" and ""Out Of The Silent Planet"".Lets face it... The only reason this album is so popular is because of the return of Adrian Smith & Bruce Dickinson. If they still had Blaze Bailey on vocals this would have been yet another flop. Those Smith/Dickinson arselickers make me sick."
2,A mediocre release from a talented band.,"I was so excited when I heard The Wicker Man on the radio. It sounded like the Iron Maiden I loved back in the eighties. Wicker Man is indeed a good song. So are The Mercenary and Dream Of Mirrors. The rest of the album sounds like it was done by the numbers. Slow beginning, hard rocking, slow ending. This trend seems to have begun with the song Fear Of The Dark. It is nice that Bruce and Adrian are back in the band, but I believe that three guitarist is a bit superfluous."
4,Maiden comeback album,"The album reminds me of 'No Prayer for the Dying'. Lyrically the album is pretty good, though I still love Bruce's 'Chemical Wedding' much better. I noticed the radio-edit of 'Wicker Man' is different which was somewhat of a dissapointment. This album is a must-buy though. A very raw sounding mix. Not as much 'dueling guitar' harmonies as I had expected. It's excellent that all of the tracks are based off of books, though the lyrical content doesn't reflect the book itself very well though. The music sounds modern and new, which is often hard for older rockers. Up the Irons!"
5,BRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCE!,"Welcome back Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith!While I know Blaze Bayley (sp?) and Paul Di'Anno have their fans, Iron Maiden just ain't Iron Maiden without Bruce Dickinson. Plus, with the return of guitarist Adrian Smith, the lineup is a little crowded (is Janick Gers, though a good guitarist, really necessary?), but the lineup still makes for a great album with classic Maiden sound.The title track as well as the first radio release, ""Wicker Man"" definitely are reminiscent of a style not heard since ""Powerslave,"" but others like ""Ghost of the Navigator"" and ""Dream of Mirrors"" harken back to some of the more metaphysical songs of old, such as ""Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" and ""Heaven Can Wait.""Definitely an album to add to the metal collection, in an era where true metal is becoming difficult to find, and rap / metal hybrid (insert four-letter ""S"" word synonymous with human excrement here) is all the rage."
3,Actually 3 1/2 stars,So this is how Maiden will sound at the turn of the century? Cool. I can live with that. This is a pretty decent album with a few really excellent songs. A good album by a great band entering their declining years.
4,Good comeback.,"It's about time the Maiden kings got back! This is a great album ever since the downfall in the 90s. Bruce takes the vocals down a little bit, but still is very good. Very intelligent lyrics also to these epics. There are a few problems. (...) It's too long. Also, there are some boring parts in diffrent songs. But it's ok. Janick Gers adds more to the band. (...) I think he's a great guitarist, and fits perfectly with the band. Also, there are some of the band's best hits. Wicker Man, Nomad, and Dream Of Mirrors to name a few. Good album."
2,another boring CD,"another boring maiden CD, but the stefords will claim it to be one of their very best. Brave new world, dance of death, and A matter of life and death are like one long boring album."
5,"Bruce is back, and all is right in this brave new world...","Bruce Dickinson, the man who is defined as a human air raid siren, has returned to Iron Maiden, finally getting rid of the ill-fated Blaze Bayley. Also back is old Maiden guitarist Adrian Smith, giving Maiden a three guitar lineup and making them fiercer sounding than ever. The songs are fantastic as well; ""The Wickerman"", ""The Nomad"", ""Ghost of the Navigator"", ""Out of the Silent Planet"", and the title track are standouts, but ""The Thin Line Between Love and Hate"" sounds like nothing but a filler song just thrown onto here. Other than that, Maiden is back, better than ever, and all is right with the brave new world."
4,energetic stylistic explosion of exploiting black sounds and,"Lining up with prevailing contemporary taste nakashi has outdone themselves this time and redfined the rules behind the bass-driven pop music of america, a hybrid of precision-tooled groove and the flamboyant styles of professional procurers. This album for the first time allows nakashi to take over full reign of their creative abilities and playing; By adding the mysterious mike c into the mix, Slap funk bass-playing and stop 'n' start drum pounding and scored the gospel-tinged background vocals on ""was it something', as well as some stirring string arrangements the equation appears complete."
5,The best you can get!,"The Integrated Principles of Zoology is the most thorough of the three in the Hickman/Zoology series. For a collegiate zoology/animal biology course, you can't find anything better. The 5th edition was the college/university standard back in 1975 when I took Zoology, and in the 11th edition is still the standard now when I teach Zoology. The text has been significantly revised since the 10th edition, with a terrific art program."
5,You MUST purchase this DVD!!,"I was skeptical when I ordered this DVD because I have had bad luck with ""beginners"" workout videos. I am so happy that I was wrong in this case. Ms. Ivanhoe is a wonderful coach and really guides beginners through each pose. I never felt pushed to the limits but I did feel energized and like I had a good workout when I was done.Using the stability ball is a great tool for doing the poses, also. Throughout my workout I kept thinking that I can't wait to do this again tomorrow. I have NEVER thought that about excercise before!!If you have never done yoga before, this is the video for you. I can't recommend it enough!"
2,Huh?,Who came up with this concept? It had to have been someone studying marketing strategy and not someone who is a yogi or a fan of the fitness ball. I felt awkward during this workout. It did not make me burn calories (unless you count the giggles as I rolled around).
2,same stuff,thought the prevoius three albums were better. startin to sound the same but not in a good way.
3,A good series concludes,"I really liked the first and third books in this series, and the second one was ok, so I was looking forward to an exciting conclusion.This book was exciting, but I thought it got too involved in the mystical nonsense surrounding the Lifestone and Pug and Tomas and Murmandamus. I wish the story could have focused more on Arutha and Jimmy and the other fine characters that Feist has created and a good plot.If you read the other books in the series, you will probably enjoy this one as well, but I thought, while it was still ok, it was the worst of the series."
5,"AWESOME,JUST NOT AS GOOD AS MAGICIAN","If I ever really enjoyed any of Feist's works, I really enjoyed this amazing masterpiece. I don't think it should even be compared to Tolkien like so many others have done. This is an excellent book with wit and humor(I thought it was the funniest in the series). Of course, it can't surpass the two Magician books, they're simply the best. Oh yeah, I just want to say something, women readers might find Feist's female characters disgusting, but I'm a guy so I really didn't care."
5,Magnificent epic!!,I read this a few years ago and later forgot about it. The other day I saw it at the public library. Needless to say that I reread the entire saga! This work is eclipsed only by Lord of the rings. If you like Tolkien and Piers Anthony then you should love this saga!!
5,First one & we're hooked,"We first saw Yo Gabba Gabba on Nick Jr. My son was mesmerized by the giant talking puppets. Not only that, but he then started repeating the lessons - don't bite friends, hands to self, clean up, etc. Yo Gabba Gabba has become a centerpiece of learning and having fun - very catchy songs!"
2,poor choice,not enough action to hold my 20 mth old attention.She loves all the other Gabba DVD's except this one.
3,Not as good as Hit the Spot Pilates,But it is still a decent work out for a beginner. I just dont feel the deep burn with this DVD. I use it when I'm sore or being lazy.
5,It works!!,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this DVD! Once a day for an entire week and I could see that my body had slimmed! You have to keep it up because the weight will come back.Well done, Denise. Thank you for making a program that actually works."
5,A Captivating Intro to the Uplift Series,"The themes explored in Startide Rising make for a captivating read. Its firm grounding in physics makes for an exciting exploration of less well defined issues including the nature of consciousness and the mysteries of linguistic thought. While I was initially a little put off by some of the main characters being dolphins, the novel is so well written that it soon became natural.This is technically the second book, but I recommend you start with it. It makes a fantastic intro to the vast complexities of David Brin's Uplift universe--a series definitely worth reading."
3,"A good read, liked the dolphin characters and aliens","What first attracted me to this book is the combination of animals and science fiction. The dolphin characters are hard to distinguish but take on their own shape later. The space battle scenes are thrilling and remind me of the E.E. 'Doc' Smith lensman series. Some of the prose is simple and at times childish, but I enjoyed the uplift concepts and universe very much, and have started to read Sundiver, although reviews say this is the poorest of the series. The aliens do have very solid characters as species and I found a strong mental image had formed of the different creatures. A good read, money and time well spent."
3,"""Talking dolphins""","Despite the fact that I wasn't terribly impressed with Sundiver, I read the sequel Startide Rising. You could review this book with two words: ""talking dolphins."" To be fair however, the dolphins were actually pretty interesting. In Startide Rising we return to the universe Brin has created where races ""Uplift"" promising species by genetically engineering their intelligence. Lo and behold the simple wolfling humans (actually dolphins for the most part in a ship full of water, good grief) have discovered the missing Progenitors, the supposed parent race of everyone else. At any rate, hilarity ensues as the dolphins crash land on a watery planet (lucky) and attempt to hide while the advanced races fight it out for who gets to capture the clever dolphins and learn the secret of the Progenitors."
2,Ugh!,"Boy, was this book a disappointment. 300 pages of characterization and situational development! Why did it take so long! It could have been done in half that many pages! And then the resolution was way too short! I would have loved to see what happened beyond Mr. Brin's ending. He should have taken those 150 pages he didn't need for setup and used them to expand the resolution. For pages and pages, I was like, ""Ugh, enough with the dolphin-speak and the reiteration that there's something strange about the planet! Get on with the story!"" It was so frustrating.Now I'm wary of picking up the next book in the series, The Uplift War. If it's as slow as this one, I'm not looking forward to it."
3,Pretty good.,"It had a really slow start, but it got better towards the end. David Brin created a really interesting world in this book which in my opion makes it worth a read."
5,The Most romantic movie ever seen,"When I was a teenager I went to the theater finding out that the movie we planned to see was changed, anyway we decided to stay and waiting fro the new movie The Promise appeared on screen...What a lovely one!!! OMG!! I never never forgot it...I tried to find a copie some years ago and almost payed 85 bucks for it, but finally was stock out... couple of months ago I ordered it thru here ( Amazon) and what a surprise I received a wrong one (made in china)I was frustrated....I'll wait for the DVD version...hope it comes before I pass out...lol (Lourdes Rendon)"
4,Better than most.,Better than most on the tips side of Elk hunting. What to take on a pack trip. And how and whin to use calls on Elk. Jim is open minded on the rilfe side of thing allso.
3,Lots of listings!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was impressed with the almost 4,000 bottles listed in this book. I was disappointed, however, in the limited number of pictures the author used. Several were very difficult to see and the descriptions were rather vague. The book is small enough in size to be taken along when shopping for old bottles and I find this to be very helpful. In the front of the book there are very brief tips on identifying, buying and selling bottles. I found these tips to be short but informative. I am only a novice to bottle collecting but I think this book would be good for a beginner or a veteran collector. My favorite feature of this book is its compact size. I like the fact that I can easily take it with me when I go shopping for bottles."
4,Sweet looking rocket!,"This is my second rocket kit from Quest... I've built about 30 rockets over the years. First, note that I ordered, sent back, then got another order with botched decals (guessing from heat and decals sticking to the instruction sheet), but called Quest and they sent me new decals (took 1.5 weeks). Aside from that, this is a good kit - fun to make and looks super. I did not make it fully to scale as the 'air scoop' seemed like it would add a lot of drag during flight. Also note the tail cone is paper and not blown plastic, so it is a bit delicate. I've only launched her once, but she flew extremely well - be careful to direct the launch rod vertically, because if this bird gets going horizontal, you better have a LOT of recovery room (seems like all the missile rockets do). Very happy to have this one on my shelf!"
1,Boring,"If you are an illustrator or artist in search of fresh ideas, this is NOT the book for you. It's uber basic and not very informative. Blah."
1,"""new"" atari joysticks are junk","Seriously broke within 2 minutes of using it.the internal part is a white plastic ring that has nubs on it, which when moved in a particular direction, make contact with the buttons on the breadboard.. the white plastic is SO flimsy and definitely made with a manufacturing defect. i had 2 of them, they both broke in the SAME spot within minutes of using it.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEYPlease, create a new model with a bit more thought as to making it last"
1,Bought two- One didn't work at all. The other doesn't work well.,"Bought these for my husband for Christmas. Right out of the box one does not work and the other sticks, so playing games is difficult. These are total junk and being returned."
5,Better than people make it out to be,I just got done with this book and it's the first of douglas adams i've read. I actually really enjoyed it ive read it twice now and it is pretty hillarious. TOns of irony ect i give this 5/5 easy. Great sit down and read book.
3,About as Lightweight a Sci-Fi Book as You Can Get,"It will remind you of those booklets that come with some computer games that purport to tell the story behind the game you are about to play, except this one is more cleverly written and occasionally delightfully silly. PLEASE don't think about taking it too seriously. Most of the technology is now easily recognizable Douglas Adams fare, like the translation solutions. It's such a quick read that you won't believe it when it ends, rather suddenly. Too bad it grew up in the shadow of the resurgence of interest in that ""other"" Titanic. It coulda been a contender."
4,Really Entertaining !!,"Not having read ""Hitchhiker's...""(so shoot me!), I did not have any expectations prior to reading ""Starship Titanic"". I picked it up on a whim for just $5 from a 2nd-hand bookshop, and ended up reading most of it on the way back home! I did find it entertaining, and very funny. Jones' way of combining Earthly wackiness with alien life and characters made me forget they were aliens, and just accept them as normal folk - which they were (on their own planets)! The blend of zany situations described in an almost matter-of-fact manner made for a usually hilarious book. I got a number of rather odd looks from fellow bus-passengers, but just couldn't stop! I was also in the middle of a number of rather weighty assessments for University - but that didn't stop me either! I have never actually read a book that I ""couldn't put down""... and always thought that was a rather cliched and exaggerated expression, but it did apply to this book. It's definitely a good, if not great read!"
2,I'm saddened by this publication,"I guess I should blame it on Douglas Adams for having the idea in the idea in the first place, but I CAN'T! He's my favorite author! I'm still having trouble dealing with the fact that he produced this.Still, I could blame Terry Jones for writing the stupid thing, but I CAN'T! Monty Python was the greatest comedy troupe ever! I could always count on him to give a funny one-liner or to do that great screaming woman voice. I'm having trouble dealing with the fact that he wrote this. All those sex jokes in the second half, give me a break! It gets old quick.I only gave this 2 stars because, even through its faults, ther are a few funny scenes involving robots."
1,Save your money,"Weak writing, unfunny, uninteresting, and one of the few books I may actually put down before I finish. I'm halfway through now and it's a struggle to force myself to read further. Don't waste your dough on this one, folks."
4,Starship Titanic is a good book.,"Starship Titanic is a good book, but not compared to the books by Douglas Adams. Terry Jones' charactor development is not as good, and Adams did a better job of kepping his books intrusting- If you are consiering bying this book becuse of Douglas Adams' name on the cover, you may be disapointed, but probably will not."
4,Rather odd...,"I thought it to be rather odd that the book is called 'Douglas Adams's Starship Titanic : A Novel'.Shouldn't 'Terry Jones' Starship Titanic : A Novel' be a better name for it?I only found out that the book wasn't actually written by Douglas Adams until I read a review about it here on amazon.com.I haven't read it yet (Holland is a bit behind, and I didn't want to wait a long time, so I didn't order it here), but it sort of spoiled the fun to find out Douglas' name is associated with marketing instead of writing...I'd rather have him write his own books instead of selling his name to someone who wants to be a writer.Don't get me wrong, I like both their work (a lot), but I feel a wee bit (yes. I've been to Scotland) misguided.It better be a good book..."
2,frantic and dull at the same time,"Reads more like a description of a movie - lots of action, plenty of screaming and running in circles, plus sex. Disappointing, considering the talents of the authors. No plot to speak of."
3,"Quite alright, but not as good as The Hitchhiker-series","I'm a big fan of Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker-series, although I thought it got a bit less entertaining in the end. The Starship Titanic was an alright read, I found it amusing, but really not as funny or imaginative as the Hitchhiker-books. Some parts were better than others, and if you like Adams and Monty Python etc. it's OK. It might be better as a computer game, though"
4,The game is awesome!,"I think you guys haven't been with the game enough. When you play it, it really puzzles you. But you can just play around with the Bots. You guys probably haven't read the magazine. Most of the answers are in there. Not to mention that each sentence, ad and announcement is funny. You really need to use each of the senses. The Music room and Bomb and Titanic Tittalator are really easy if you use your common sense, do stuff the most practical way, and realize that the Succ-U-Bus doesn't like sauces.This is the best video game I've seen. My friend started putting it down, but once he started playing it, he wouldn't stop, even to eat. The graphics are amazing, the casting and voices are unreal, and the whole plot is downright funny!"
1,More for e-book than Paperback-BULL!!!,No way I will EVER pay more for an e-book than a paperback when the publisher's cost is so much less. RIP OFF!
3,not the greatest,small pictures and just little blurbs for each. Not even a half a page per airline with a description of the airline. More like quick reference see the pic and read whats in the photo. Something like looking at a bunch of newspaper pics & descriptions. However the picture of the planes were detailed and nice colours.
3,Still love the voice,"I bought this CD last year (yeah I know it's a little late) and dusted it off recently and listened to it again. JT Taylor is hands down my favorite male artist. However this CD does not show his array of talent in my opinion; even though I could listen to ""Marry Me"" and ""All Said and Done"" over and over again. I hope that he releases more solo (or even K&TG) CD's that really showcase his beautiful smooth voice. Love you JT!"
2,Only comes with one film,"This is a semi-rigid film that is somewhat unforgiving if you don't line it up the first time. I prefer the ""screen magnet"" type films (as opposed to this adhesive type) which allow you to reposition or clean up if dust gets trapped inside.Also, the package comes with one screen, not two like the description (at the time of this review) states."
4,Wonderful reference for collectors!,"Great book for the avid collector of 20th century glass. Arranged by style, this reference book is easy to use. What would make this book a 5 star book? More color photographs would make this an unbeatable buy."
2,WHEELCHAIR,"we recived the wheelchair only to find that one of the wheels was warped., it took three phone calls to be able to talk to someone. the first time we left a phone massage. the second call, the wheelchair expert was not in again no call back. the third time we talked to a very nice person who sent us a replacement unit. she promised to send us labels to return the defective unit. to date we have heard nothing. when we received the second wheelchair ,it had a users handbook and a warranty card. from that we can only assume that first unit had been previously sent to someone and returned because of the defect"
1,Shanghai Duped,"After seeing the incredible movie starring Jackie Chan and listening to the great music playing throughout including the Kid Rock popular song,we could not wait for the soundtrack. Imagine our surprise and dismay to find out it is all instrumental! Never do you hear the words that has become synonymous with this movie "" you want to be a cowboy baby""..."
1,Tore open after 10 minutes,"Looked nice, but the workmanship is horrible. My son played with it for 10 minutes and the stitching is already breaking open."
5,Great tool for 7th grade through high school & beyond,"I am very impressed with the content of the dvd. Segments are very well defined and the structure is easy to navigate through. Concepts are well demonstrated and explained and the visual aids used are top-notch. The drills are very well explained and can easily be transformed into plays. As a coach with 8 years of experience coaching grades 4 through 8, I am taking over the High School Varsity for the first time. This dvd series has helped imensely so far & I can't wait for the series to continue!"
5,Among the best Lacrosse DVDs available,"Like the first Winning Lacrosse DVD, for beginners, this intermediate video is well produced and packed with good information. Highy recommended!"
5,JUST BUY IT FOR THE VALUE OF THESE MATCHES!,"THE MATCHES ARE ACTUALLY NOT THAT GOOD. BUT, JUST FOR THE SIMPLE FACT THAT THESE ARE VERY EARLY MATCHES FROM STEVE AUSTIN'S CAREER, THIS IS A MUST-HAVE!! TONY ATLAS AND SOME OTHER GUY HOST THIS COLLECTION OF MATCHES. IF YOU WANT TO OWN SOME OF THE RARE USWA MATCHES THAT AUSTIN WAS IN BEFORE HE WENT TO WCW, GET THIS DVD NOW!!!!"
3,Good CD but it is not mixed,This is a good CD but it is not mixed. When i listen to Techno I don't like breas in between the songs. It ruins the momentum of the music. This would have been a four if it were a mixed CD because the track selection is just what I expected to hear from Frankie.
5,Paulding Farnham: Tiffany's Lost Genius,The book was well written and informative. Paulding was a fabulous designer who until recently never got his due recognition. Photos are great.
3,Good price with faults,"The product works, that's the good side. The downside is the fan issue. After the 2nd or 3rd use the fan would sound like it was grinding against something. With a little tapping on the grille that covers the fan I am able to get the grinding sound to stop, but I have to do that everytime I turn the enclosure on.I would have probably gone with a different product if I'd been smart & read the reviews BEFORE I made this purchase."
4,Good for intermittent backup,"I have owned this product for over a year. It has done a great job for me. However, I only use it for backup, and turn it on about once a week, do the backup, and then turn it off. No loud fan noise yet, as some report. It was a tight fit, and I had trouble putting in the hard drive disk because I have arthritis. I like it, it looks good, and so far is working great for me!"
1,Not reliable and NOISEY,"Mine stopped working after about 9 months. I thought it was the HD inside. I heard a clicking noise form the drive. The drive works fine in my desktop, but wont work in this enclosure. I think the power supply crapped out, lost voltage or something. I will try another enclosure."
1,Fan buzzes loudly on both of mine,"Not recommended. The fan has a tendency to come unbalanced and start buzzing loud enough to be heard in the next room with the door shut. I bought three of them and both started giving this problem within 10 days of continuous use. The buzzing issue can be triggered by repositioning or touching the enclosure slightly or by opening or closing drawers in the desk that it is resting on. The buzzing can be stopped by taking the case apart and applying pressure to the bearing at the center of the fan (underneath the sticker), or sometimes by stopping and starting the fan, but it usually returns anywhere from 10 minutes later (for the worst one of mine) to 1 week later (for the best one). This isn't just a case of the wires touching the fan, as the fan still buzzes with the enclosure opened, the hard drive removed and the wires out of the way."
3,Sheeplessly OK,The Sheepskin Pad Cover is soft and cuddly but does not work good while rubbing over clothing. Feels good on bare skin though.
5,Well worth the investment,"We first cam across the Jeanie Rub Massager at our local chiropractor. My wife and I both liked the way it worked in the office so we decided to get one for home use. It is a heavy device that feels like it is made to last. While it is not a do-it-yourself device, it does exactly what it should and we believe it is well worth the money."
2,couldn't take the smell,"I really wanted to like the Sebamed line of products, but I just could not take the smell. If you're planning on purchasing this line of products, try to get samples to determine if you can tolerate the scent before purchasing."
4,Nice!,"Bought the Helmsman after looking for a good multi-purpose knife for sailing.Plus: The blade is really sharp and lockable - very important since I would hate to have it snap back on my hand, the marlin spike is good for knots of a decent size, and the tools are standard fare on a Victorinox.What I would have liked included : The marlin, Philips screwdriver and awl to be locakable, a wrist strap to be included, the color to be bright to make it easy to locate if dropped in the boat, some way to make it float :-) if dropped overboard."
4,I really liked this book!,"The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is its a little dated and she kind of plays fast and loose with the Vitamin/Supplement section. But her writing style is SOO enjoyable. And the majority of the book, where she discusses the various types of low carb programs out there and the pros and cons of each, is very well researched and written in plain English. I kind of feel guilty about only 4 stars because it is a very well written book. Maybe Dana C. will write another revision and shore up the last section with some well-researched info to corroborate her supplement recommendations. Or readers can just skip that part."
1,This book is NOT signed.....,"I bought this book on the assumption that it was ""signed"" by the author like in the description. I recieved a copy of Tapping the Vein book 3 which I already own and book 4 with the spine broken and NOT signed. I asked them to change the description to a more honest one but it still the same as of today. Not a good buy."
1,This book is bad,"If you want to know everything about photon mapping this is not the book to buy. The book is full of weak points and lacks many details and, I'm sad to say, the author at some points confuses more than he does anything else. Furthermore the book only goes half the way - there is so much more to the photon map technique.The true target group for this book is difficult to specify. If you don't know anything about computer graphics it is probably good in some ways if you can detects the errors - very unlikely. If you are an experienced games programmer, this is too introductionary."
3,God moves in less mysterious ways,"The Doctor has been showing off - he has brought Fitz and Anji to a planet where it is pretty much impossible to get to. Such an isolated place would seem somewhere where a series of experiments could be run, away from prying eyes. And experiments on a very large scale have been carried out here...An odd book for the Doctor Who range, this book has a religious storyline running through it. The adventure takes place in a society that has been shaped by a very strong religion, a religion that offers truth to its adherents.And the outcasts of this society also play an important role in the book.Steve Cole is a writer who produces a reasonable book, but seems to achieve better results with a partner. This is a solo book, and not what it might be.Somewhat downbeat, the book probably isn't one that you'd want to read if you are depressed."
2,very simple,I did not find a lot of useful information. Very general. It will not teach you more than you know. Save your money.
2,metal fan has a rap cd,"I'm going to be honest. I got this cd simply for one song. ""God Gave Rock N Roll to You,"" is an Argent song from way back that DOC did a cover of with hard rock\ heavy metal band Bride. I am not a rap fan, nor have I ever been. This was probably one of the last recordings to come out that had a crossover of rap and Hard Rock before the rap-core and rap-metal bands (Kid Rock, Rage Against the Machine and EDL) came on the scene. Before what we had were artists like Run DMC that decided to do a song with a rock Band like Aerosmith or Anthrax. The CCM industry followed suit nearly a decade later with artists like this one (DOC) doing songs with bands like Bride, Tourniquet and Deliverance.DOC has a very trendy album here, as most pop is and was at the time."
5,Lots of princesses,"I was happy to find a poster that included many of the Disney princesses, and not just the usual 3 that seem to be everywhere (Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty)."
1,How I see it.,"The DVD is full of wrestlers that I don't know. Yet I do know about the Bushwackers, and that is why I bought this DVD.The matches are:The Missing Link VS. The SpoilerMissing Link Bang your Head VideoWild Bill Irwin and Big Bertha VS. Black Bart and Skandor AkbarKarate Kid VS. Little TokyoKevin Sullivan and the Purple Haze VS. Phil Apollo and Rob Van WinkleKamala VS. Kerry Von ErichSherry Martel VS. Candi DivineBushwackers VS. Bastion Booger and King KaluhaAll the videos look like it was copied strait form the TV. The sound is very, very bad. One minute it was loud as heck, then it when so low that I had to turn up the sound all the way up.This DVD is not a good buy."
1,Why would anyone like this show...?,It was poorly cast and had some of the lamest jokes I ever saw on any sitcom. This is prove possitive why TV shows on DVD are a big joke.
1,Garbage,"To the question: Who Doesn't Love Raymond!!!, that some have posed here. Can I answer, I dont! This comedy is average at best. Its not terrible, but it just isnt that funny. Here in the UK, unlike brilliant shows we import from the US like; Seinfeld, Larry Sanders, Will and Grace, Frasier, Sex and the City....this comedy is really average.Maybe its Ray Romano, who gets paid a ridiculous sum each episode. Face it he's not funny! His delivery is like Droopy on downers, yes that dull. Even here someone said in a review that the other characters were funnier.This comedy is one step from the Cosby Show, and that is not a complement, trust me. The gags are lined up with big red flags before they arrive for the audience to laugh at. Very 1970s.Here in the UK, unlike the other brilliant comedies we import from the US, this show is put on at 8am in the week. Ie the ""dead zone"", as people just arent interested in it. Sorry!"
1,Nobody Loves Raymond,"It's beyond me who would watch ELR. I've honestly tried to watch a complete episode because there is so much positive buzz around it but to me I still haven't been able to do so. I must admit, Patricia Heaton is hilarious but the rest of the cast comes off as being just bitter and caricatures of real people - especially Raymond's brother, Robert."
4,Good on its way to very good,"Funny at times and yet one can tell someone fuller, funnier and more wonderful is coming. This is a must for those who buy the whole DVD collection. If not, buy it to watch it and then sell it later. Or you may laugh enough to want to keep it once you own it."
5,Not a fan of tea but I love this!,"Not only am I not a fan of tea, I'm not a fan of licorice but I was open to trying this as a means to help me manage my IBS (I also use fennel and peppermint tea). This tastes so delicious, I want to drink it whether my stomach feels good or not! Yummy! And a cup does sooth my savage stomach."
3,"Tensioner broke, leaving exposed screws","SO, first two months this thing was great, but just today the tensioner broke leaving exposed screws on the box and not allowing the lid to stay open. Very disappointing. Unfortunately we are out of the warranty on this thing and can't return it. Very very upset about this. Beware, I read a lot of reviews on this and decided it was still worth buying, now i'm kicking myself!Edit: KidKraft is sending me replacement pieces, we'll see how that goes...moved up to 3 stars"
3,Beautiful piece of furniture,"I bought this toy box for my grandchild, and very pleased with what I have purchased. It is not only a functional item, but a beautiful piece of furniture. It can grow with my grandchild, and can be used for a long time in his room. Not only can it be used for a toy box, but as he gets older it can be used for storage and an extra seat with cushion in his roomThank you for offering this item to us."
1,Looks good and is sturdy made BUT,"One part missing and one part not drilled, so got it two weeks ago and still waiting on parts."
2,You get what you pay for,"Bought this on sale, for about 1/2 the cost of the Camelback ""Classic"". But I rarely use it since no matter what I do, it leaks. It leaks at the joint where the drinking tube attaches to the bladder. After about the 3rd use, a velcro patch used to close the top of the pack started unstiching from the pack. I would not recommend this product."
5,Great product,Great product especially for the price! Great zip pocket and pouch. Love the clip to hold the mouthpiece.
5,comfortable and stylish!,"I have these in black and red. . they are so comfortable and they look great even on my ugly feet. It is rare that a woman can find a comfortable shoe that doesn't look granny or lesbo. . . This is truly a one-of-a-kind shoe! I see now why it is so high quality -- it is made in Austria, not China! You're probably hemming and hawing over the price, but really, if you want cheap crap from China that will fall apart after 6 months, this isn't the shoe for you. If you want comfort and style that's totally worth the price and lasts years and years, this is the shoe for you!"
2,Don't waste your money,A corner on my carpet tucker broke off after the first day of use. The plastic is cheap.
5,good quality pull,I was concerned that the pull might not be of the best quality and might appear cheap. I did not need the highest quality but I did not want a cheap looking pull either. This pull is a good heavy weight and the varied shading of the bronze matches the faucet I purchased at a big box store very nicely.
4,I Like It,"I found one of these in the plastics bin at the local recycling center, and I really like it better than anything else I've had. I have mine sitting on a concrete block. Of course chickens are messy but you should really change their water every day anyway so just hose everything out when you do. I cut the bottom out of a bleach bottle and set it down over the lid so as not to have chickens roosting on top.I wish it came with a heated base, that's the only reason I give it one less star."
2,Leaks! Don't buy!,"My waterer is on the floor of chicken coop - not entirely level but pretty close. I have tried multiple times to refill it and try different water levels but it keeps leaking! My entire coop is wet.... I might be misusing it, but I assembled it correctly and it should be easier to use correctly if I am misusing it. I wouldn't recommend this!"
3,"It takes some playing around, but eventually it works","I purchased this product to combine two phone books on two different phones into one phone. My computer runs Windows XP. Initially I got the message that I needed to obtain administration rights. I am the administrator. I called cust support and was directed to run the program in the windows 95 format. This allowed it to work. There are some bugs that inhibit the phone recognition when it is plugged in. However, once the phone is recognized, the program does what I expected of it.The program provides a safe backup of all my phone numbers, and that is a definite plus."
3,It does the job....,"With my phone's display busted I find it hard to see the details on the screen (heh), so writing down the data on my phone to transfer to another is rather difficult. ;-)This package handles many different phones, and in my case was a life saver to saving my phone book data.I expected a better UI though, this one reminds me of the old Windows 3.1 days... Ok, maybe Win 95. Seriously though, it's not a pretty tool, but it's a functional tool."
5,The best for picture frames,"I've had this machine for more than 10 years. I don't use it except for picture frames and it has been a real asset. It is easy to use, reliable and well worth its price."
5,I like it so much I wish I could buy the company,"After shaving every morning for bo0-coo years, I now shave when I must. Now I have a very light beard and it tends to curl. I do manage to have a mustache, though. Now that you know more about me than you ever wanted to know...I used a...well, I guess it isn't polite to mention the other brand..just let me say that I'm glad I didn't buy the company. I used one of them since I got my drinking license and that way back.Comparing the two isn't really a comparison. This sucker runs rings around the ol' Vic Kiam(sp?) stuff. The curly wiskers that hid and hid from the old razor disappear in a pass or two. The `stach trimmer wacks things like the old trooper couldn't do on the first day.Have used it dry, as I've always shaved that way, and the yanks on the occasional hair doesn't happen. Nice close shave and no pain. I AM REALLY IMPRESSED!!! As a guy with a weird beard, this sucker does a number. Where were you for the last 40 years or so???"
5,"Nostalgic, exotic, and a welcome resource","The Historical Cookbook Of The American Negro was originally published in 1958 as a community cookbook. A memorable compendium of recipes, facts, bios, documents, illustrations, documents, and anecdotes tracing the lost history of the African-American community and culture, Beacon Press has reissued this American culinary classic with all 132 mouth watering recipes which pay special tribute to African-American pioneers. From Emancipation Proclamation Breakfast Cake, Sliced Potato Pie, and A Nut Cake to Israel, to New England Suet Pudding, Brussel Sprouts with Paprika Sour Cream, and Yam Pork Chop Skillet, The Historical Cookbook Of The American Negro is nostalgic, exotic, and a welcome resource for any contemporary meal planner menu."
4,Kindle version has issues,"The content of this book is great. It is well written and insightful. The kindle version, however, has issues with the diagrams being several pages away from the discription of the diagram."
4,"If you like pool, you'll love this book...","I've seen Jeanette Lee play pool a few times on ESPN but never knew that much about her. As an avid pool player myself, I was always impressed with her ability and decided to pick up a copy of THE BLACK WIDOW'S GUIDE TO KILLER POOL after seeing it in a local book store. I was impressed; not only did this book reveal a few insights to the game -- especially in the fundamentals chapter -- but it also told the story of her life, which I found to be inspiring."
2,More Instruction Less Self-Promotion,"Jeanette Lee, argueably the world's most famous pool player, titles her book: The Black Widow's Guide to Killer Pool. She should have titled it The Black Widow's Guide to Killer Self-Aggrandizement. The book, in fact, contains little information or instruction for anyone more experienced than a novice to the game. Rather, the book serves as a rather shameless plug for Ms. Lee, detailing her triumphs on and off of the pool table, from how she battled crippling scoliosis, to how she (in her own mind) saved the WPBA (Women's Pro Billiards Association) with her looks and fashion sense. The book was an interesting read however, if just to see how Jeanette Lee sees her own contributions to the pool community."
1,A Waste of time,"The book goes on simply bad mouthing whites with stereotypes and misconceptions about European-Americans. It has no real valid points, save for that the author is a racist.If you hate white people then you should buy this book, it will go well with your other racist propaganda library.If you are white and want to read all the negetive misconceptions about whites and then feel self hatred then by all means buy this book.If you are trying to understand what whiteness truely is and to understand and see the larger picture of whites in the world, then don't buy this book, it will only fill your head with propaganda.If you want to buy the book you may be able to find it for free at a Wal-Mart bargain bin... aka the dumpster behind the store."
5,Perfect,I was looking for the song She Stays - and I was surprised & thrilled that I could find it! GREAT SONG!!!!!
3,When Time Ran Out(1980),"Irwin Allen became the ""Master of Disaster"" after making The Poseidon Adventure(1972) and The Towering Inferno(1974). By 1980, people were losing interest in big budget disaster films. When Time Ran Out(1980) is a decent camp classic. One can watch it for unintentionally funny scenes. An Asian guy falls sideways from a helicopter! This DVD version of the film is very short. There are no extras or a chapter index! Paul Newman plays a guy who is digging for oil in Hawaii. He has to lead people to safety as a volcano destroys most of the island. The music score by Lalo Schifrin is quite good. You can hear dozens of violins as fireballs smash into buildings or people. Dante's Peak(1997) and Volcano(1997) tried to ""recreate"" the magic of this film. Jacqueline Bisset, William Holden, Pat Morita, and Alex Karras co-star. When Time Ran Out was a decent disaster film that suffered from bad timing."
4,the last disaster movie!,"back in 1980 came ""when time ran out"" after a glorious decade of disaster movies started in 1970 with ""airport"".Even if you're not a ""genre"" fan you 've got to watch this film for at least three reasons:paul newman ,jackie bisset and william holden.they perfectly embody ""real life heroes"" taken into horrid events(my favorite scene remains the crossing of the bridge above a lava river).Last but not least,any movie buff will enjoy the ""army""of supporting actors: the great Burgess Meredith,red buttons,ernest borgnine,veronica hamel...pure fun!"
4,Very Good...but what does Bob think about it?,"Hmmm...Some think this film was a disaster (no pun intended)...but, personally, I think this was another one of Irwin Allen's great films. I found that this is somewhat similar to THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE (1972), and THE TOWERING INFERNO (1974), also with Paul Newman. Newman is a supervisor for an oil well operation, along with his partner Bob (James Franciscus), a real jerk who just cares about his money and that's it. When the Pacific Island volcano erupts, the lava is heading slowly but surely to the doomed residents of the main resort (!!!). Cast also includes - Jacqueline Bisset, William Holden, Red Buttons, Ernest Borgnine, and Burgess Meredith. Very Good movie..."
1,"Wasted Talents, Wasted Film, Wasted Time!","After the two-fisted punch of ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""The Towering Inferno"" it is amazing to me that Irwin Allen could've produced this disastrous exercise. This one is so bad it makes Allen's other faux pas ""The Swarm"" look brilliant!Oscar winners Newman, Borgnine, and Holden must have gotten a pretty penny for their involvement on this turkey!"
2,Surprsingly FUN! And great DVD transfer.,"This film is really unfairly maligned, at least when seen in it's proper aspect ration.Some writers have complained about running time, the movie is presented in its original theatrical version (109 mins) without all the excessive and boring drama tacked on for network television. believe me, you don't want that TV version.Overall its much better than many of the mainstream special effects would-be blockbusters being premiered today.Great image quality on this DVD, looks superbit. This is the version to see."
3,When Time Ran Out,"I saw this On NetFlix Instant,I like the Old Disaster Genre Films,some of them were great others not so great.I am not sure where this one fits in,Paul Newman,Jacqueline Bisset,William Holden,Ernest Borgnine,Pat Morita,Burgess Meredith(The Cool Trainer Guy from Rocky Films,""Ya'a Bum!"")and several other ""Famous Faces"".It is predictable like most of the genre and It can Drag on,But it is one of the lesser-known films and it is worth watching at the least."
2,Enh.,"I wanted white board paint but this is not available. The white board sheets . . . enh . . . they tend to rip when peeling them off the stack, and after a few days they start to roll up and fall off: better with tape! But the real bummer so far is that they really don't erase well . . . I had to do windex on a paper towel and then scrape the marker off with my thumb. Too bad . . ."
3,Write-on Cling on sheets,"Seems to work ok for some purposes. We were trying to solve another problem since our white boards are in bad shape, we thought we would try these cling sheets. They were of some assistance."
4,Pleased As Always with Amazon,"As usual, my order arrived within days of the original purchase date. Every thing was in tact and in good condition and it was just what I was looking for. It's easy to use and very handy."
2,"Good idea, bad book","The mix of early mythology and indian folklore is and excellent premise. Too bad the book just gets worse and worse from the beginning. Granted, this is the only Charles de Lint novel I have read, but after this one, I don't want to read anymore. If you like this style of adventure and fantasy mixed, try Tim Powers' novels. Happy reading!"
1,This book is really not worth buying,"If you're looking for design inspirations for your wedding cake, the cakes in this book are- In my opinion, kitsch- Way too extravagant (and expensive) for normal weddings- Too advanced for local bakers to makeIf you want to know how to make wedding cakes, all you'll find in this book are just a few basic recipes. There are no detailed step-by-step instructions for assembling or decorating cakes.What this book does is showcase Colette Peters' outstanding skills. If you want to see it, I'd recommend a local library...."
2,"good bag, bad resevoir","just got it today and i am kinda mad there is a small leak near the top so i have to keep it upright or the bag gets soaked. the pack itself though is very nice, many pocekts for keys, cell phone, ipod, ect."
4,"Good enough, but not the best!",TRACK 1 : OKAY TRACK 2 : GOOD TRACK 3 : COOL TRACK 4 : GOOD TRACK 5 : OKAY TRACK 6 : GOOD TRACK 7 : OKAY TRACK 8 : COOL TRACK 9 : GOOD TRACK 10: CRAP TRACK 11: COOL TRACK 12: CRAP TRACK 13: COOL TRACK 14: COOL TRACK 15: OKAY TRACK 16: COOL TRACH 17: crap TRACK 18: COOL TRACK 19: WHAT???
3,Nice album but if you're looking for GNR go here...,"Nice album but FYI if you're looking for GNR like one of the other reviewers was, until the new album is for sale on Amazon you can find the new material the reviewer was talking about (as well as other examples of new GNR material) at... www .newgnr. com /dloads/audio/ (without the sapces of course)."
3,Dissapointed,Its not as sturdy as we would like and the stain is not even. I dont think I could recommend it.
2,Too Hard to Adjust,"While this thing works well, don't get it if you are going to have to change blades a lot. You basically have to readjust it for every size blade, which is what you have to do anyway, but it takes soooooo long."
1,Childish blathering,"Apparently the editor finds infantile Bush-bashing amusing, but I don't. This book is so embarrassingly bad that I don't dare give it away."
4,A good lure into the remainder of the series.,"I read Julie Czerneda's first novel when it first came out. While I enjoyed it, I thought it left a good number of questions unanswered for what I assumed then was a stand alone book. After several years passed and I saw the rest of the series in the store, I realized why those questions remained. After rereading ""Strangers"" before reading the second and third book in the series, I appreciated Czerneda's laying of plot devices more. She does a good job of having several story lines move throughout the series with none of them becoming dominant over each book's main theme.Overall a good, solid addition to the science fiction section of the book store shelves."
3,Good book,"This book is pretty good, we used it for Algebra and the book makes Algebra somewhat explainable."
2,It works but ...,"Great price on this little shredder, BUT you get what you pay for. I am used to more expensive crosscutting shredders that really ensure that NO ONE is going to put the document back together. With this shredder the end product are nice clean strips of paper about 1/6 of an inch wide that, unless you really stir the shredded contents of the can before you throw them out, would be fairly easy to recover a name, address, and account number from (four adjoining strips on one of the statements I just shredded). I really should have spent another $25 or so and gotten a fine cross-cutter. My bad. Oh, and it is noisy, but the auto switch seems to work adequately enough (although I would be willing to bet it will stick if I run a few old mailing stickers through it)."
3,paper shredder not the best,ok paper shredder. good if you don't have alot of stuff to shred. need to shred only 1-3 pages at a time can't do more than that otherwise it stops working. doesn't shred into small pieces. good for simple one off shredding.
5,Dotsero - one of the best smooth jazz group!,"It's one of the best live smooth jazz album. I recommend this CD to everyone, who is looking for something fresh and new. Amazing music, amazing recording, very talented musicians."
3,A Couple Glitches...,"I do not personally own this DVD player, but both my brother and sister each own this model. My sister's will sometimes refuse to read discs, and my brother's does the same. They have owned their players for about a year now. My brother uses his alot more frequently, and is getting really annoyed with the player as of late. It does however have cool features like zoom and slow motion variances. Also, the picture is very clear, and the sound is satisfying. However, I would not recommend this purchase, nor will I be buying it myself!"
1,This doesn't charge the PSP,"The Intec charger I received was just a square box with a folding outlet piece. It didn't come with any cable, so I used the USB data cable that fits in the adapter, and while the adapter glows blue, thats about all it does..."
5,Tool,"the original was damaged by my own mistake[dropped in te water]and found this on line,very happy and still going,seems newer products dont quite keep up with durability anymore."
4,Solid Handheld.,"The HP Jornada while getting up there in years, is still a wonderful handheld device.I primarily purchased this product to manage my bank account and some office pools.It has served me very well and does more than I expected really.It was recommended to me by my father, and I would recommend it to you.It does lack some of the features that some of the new handhelds have but for everything I need, it shines above other comparably priced PDAs."
5,Great stone for the sharpest blades,"I've long been a believer in a sharp knife edge. All a dull edge does is frustrate you. I purchased the DMT 6"" Extra fine whetstone sharpener with the hardwood box. Now, all my knives, from personal carry to kitchen, have a surgical edge. The edge is obtained quickly simply by following the included directions. This stone should last a LONG time and I am happy I invested in it. I would recommend it to anyone who is serious about obtaining the best edge on their blade they can."
1,Absolutely terrible,"I bought 2 of these units, thinking the 1st one was defective.Nope... just totally defective design.Stay away from this like the plague... the grinds / water will overflow consistently, regardless of grind / filter you use. The drip-stop system they have (to stop coffee from flowing when you pull the carafe out) is very very poorly designed.Buy the Braun KF600 instead - we are extremely happy with it."
1,This one's a leaker,"This coffee maker is very attractive, but we experienced some problems. The first time we used it, the filter basket didn't fit properly in the holder which caused it to overflow and it leaked all over. We had to remove the basket and dump over 2 cups of coffee. The warmer plate was not warm and the machine turned itself off after each brew cycle. Coffee did not stay hot for an hour in the decanter. Continued to leak and I returned the item."
1,Disappointment,"I have been patient with this machine for almost a year but now I've had it! First, the water level indicator doesn't work, so no matter how much water I pour into the holding tank the little ball thing doesn't move. The basket holder is hard to open, the permanent filter makes the coffee taste bad so I chucked that thing and use paper. The aroma button makes no discernable difference, so don't buy it for that feature. There's constantly coffee and grinds all over my counter top because it leaks out the bottom somehow. The seal on the lid seems to be loose or something because there is always leaking when I pour. And, the coffee doesn't even start out hot enough, so the thermal carafe is kind of a moot point. Saving graces (that just aren't enough)are the timer and the overall sleek look of the machine. I'm headed out to look for something else."
2,I don't know why...,"...but Lara Fabian doesn't give the same emotion in these songs as when she's singing in French or Italian. I bought the English album as a ""test"", and frankly, her other albums have better song selections than this one. And she just doesn't sing the same... I miss the passion she instills in her French album songs."
5,Love by Grace,"This singer is an angel unknown and should be heard today. She has the softness of Barbra Streisand, and the power of Mariah Carey and Celine Dion. Without doubt, she will become a ""Super star."" I would recommend the Album to everyone who enjoys good music. Lara Fabian is a treasure for years to come."
5,WOW !,"If you like the breathy, sexy voice of Amy Grant, the powerful voice of Celine Dion and the emotional voice of Barbara Striesand, you will love Lara Fabian as she delicately combines the excellence of all three characteristics into a romantic and charismatic journey you will want to take over and over again."
2,Not what I thought,Not what I expected at all. Not a good quality of sound and I was very disappointed with the songs.
5,Excuisite Lara....,"such a pure voice and such a great talent...it's sad that she is'nt getting the glamour and the success she deserves in the US.this CD is more than excellent, the music and the words are just awsome, and Lara sings with such a burning passion...so please Lara, more CD's..."
2,"Almost no activities, and definately for 5 year olds.","This game has almost nothing to do, and I don not recommend it for anyone, unless you are obsessed with rescue heroes. I beat the game in minutes. I wish I had this review before I bought it."
4,Great perspective,"This CD offers great perspective - it is a unique and uplifting experience to listen to Leap of Grace. I would highly recommend it. The repetitive nature has a wonderful calming effect, which I love to play at work."
1,Reconditioned DeWalt needs more reconditioning,"Yes, I was trying to save a buck...don't do the same. The product arrived with a broken air filter and they did respond quickly to remedy the situation but its a bad inherent design flaw. Filter is a thin cheap plastic part that has an interference fit within the unit. The unit vibrates so bad that it's sure to break again. Screws come loose and they really need to be loctited or secured some way. Shortly after recieving unit I found new units for less money locally. This compressor was a replacement for a Sanborne I had for 30 years. But it runs so I'll give it one star."
3,kinda young,"While I found a few gems, and the author is clearly a gifted writer, I, at age 50, found it a little ""young"" for lack of a better term. Still, I can see the nature of this book is to help others and that counts for something. It may help you."
5,"Valley Class V Receiver w/ 2""x2"" hitch opening","The Valley 82520 is a class 5 receiver, regardless of the Amazon title saying class 4. It is solidly built without the crossbar openings on each end like some inferior models. It requires 4 bolts on each side and you may have to drill your frame holes larger to accept the new bolts. I would recommend applying satin black rustoleum spray-paint when done. It will ship partially exposed and will have some paint scraped off... Mounted to my 94 Dodge Ram 2500 without a problem. May need a helper or use a floor jack to aid you 'cause it's heavy. Doesn't integrate a wiring mounting plate so you will need an aftermarket kit and install on the bumper, etc. Amazon had THE BEST PRICE for this item at $176 with free shipping. Look no further (I tried!) Also go to ""valleyindustries.com"" and check the tables to see if this fits your vehicle..."
2,Really Disappointed with William Dufris,"I am a long time Asimov fan and i totally loved reading the entire Robot series by my favortie author. So that being said, my rating on this is not reflective of the story or author in any way. I have tried 3 times now to listen to this beautifully packaged masterpiece and have still not been able to get past half of the first chapter...All because of the horrible narrative job of William Dufris!!!He totally lacks the talent to be able to deliver this exciting novel in the way it was written. I dont think i've ever heard a reading this bad! So again, great Author, great Novel, great series, and even packaging. Terribly done narration!Some examples of great narration that i've heard for audiobooks are ""The Talisman"" by Stephen King and the ""Icewind Dale Trilogy"" by RA Salvatore. Great talents!!This one....noooo!"
5,Classic,"This is a real breakthru work. Written in the mid-fifties, it still stands up well. Very interesting main characters - Elijah and Daneel... it is a quick and fun read... of the hundreds of SciFi books I've read, I'd have to say that this is my favorite. The followup book The Naked Sun, is also top-notch work."
5,"Amazing book, a must read for any Sci-fi fan.","Asimov proves to be the ultimate king of science fiction through this first installment of the ROBOT SERIES. Intrigue, logic and the amazing three laws of robotics make it an instant classic. The Caves of Steel paves the way to Baley's future off world investigations and sets the mood to the entire series. Two THUMBS UP for this book!"
4,Fascinating,"I read this book about fifteen years ago and have been kicking myself ever since that I did not keep it instead of lending it (never seen again). This is a fascinating insight into the Rome of firstly the boy Caesar and later the political city of the Emperor Caesar. Presented as the chronicles of Cicero from boyhood, which he shared with Caesar, up to his banishment from his beloved Rome."
3,So-So,"If you are an Angelina Fan or liked ""the Bone Collector"" then you will at least want to see this movie. I can't really say it is great and I can't really say it sucks, which is basically what I have to say about ""the Bone Collector."" I would say rent it before you buy it."
1,Not very good,"This movie is a case of having high expectations only to fall incredibly flat. From the moment that Ethan Hawke's character shows up in the movie, it is obvious that he is the killer, period. Once that was established, the movie was dull and boring. I will say that it was nice to see Ms. Jolie in the buff, but it isn't enough to salvage this train wreck of a movie.Hey Hollywood, try producing a real murder mystery that you can't guess inside of 15 minutes. Just a thought."
3,Not Alfred Hitchcock...But Not A Bad Thriller Either,"OK, you won't receive a suspense overload like you did from Rear Window and Vertigo. And, this movie may be more predictable than Psycho. However, anyone who tells you that they guessed the surprise ending of Taking Lives is either lying or a better FBI profiler than Angelina Jolie's character in the film.This picture is also more loosely wound than North By Northwest but it's a fun two-hour ride with enough suspense and thrills to keep you interested and guessing if not totally riveted to your seat. Keep your expectations on that level and you'll thoroughly enjoy it."
1,Boring and tired,"Boring and tired murder mystery that takes all its parts from better movies and still makes a mockery of itself in the mystery department with a killer that can be spotted a mile away, and an ending that leaves you scratching your head on why you wasted you're time with this film in the first place. I do like Angelina Jolie but she should fire her manager for helping her pick out this film to star in."
1,Is Canada part of the USA?,"This movie is terrible. To begin with, what is the FBI doing investigating in Canada? I thought Canada was an independent nation...with their own government agencies.Secondly, the movie takes place in Montreal while on film all you see is Quebec City...thirdly, Angelina Jolie has turned into a parody of herself. Plainly overdone, she tries too hard to be incredibly sexy.So much wasted talent, Hawke, Sutherland.. etc."
3,Ok but I've seen better.,"Taking Lives starring Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke has a great and scary opening scene although the rest of the film drags and falls flat halfway through but it seems like none of the reviewers liked the ending, I thought the last 10 minutes were just as exciting as the first 10. Jolie plays her character very well, Hawke well he kinda over-acts but Taking Lives does have some frightening moments but overall this film is pretty much forgettable. So be forewarned, you might like it or might hate it, for me it was decent but I probably wouldn't watch it again."
3,"Pretty good, but. . .","this movie is pretty predictable. Only a couple of parts in this film will make you jump. I expected this movie to be scary and awesome. It's a pretty good film & Angelina Jolie is hella hot don't get me wrong, but it could have been better in many ways. But that is just my opinion. Peoples minds work a lot differently. If you want to go and see a suspensful, fun movie, then you should go see this. Oh, and there's a little [intimate] scene with Angelina and damn!!!"
4,Good Espresso Maker,Like this machine. You must be careful of the grind. Make sure its fine or this machine can be ruined. (passed experience).
1,Returned it after five days,"We've previously used Krups and Capresso espresso makers that are similarly priced to this one, but this is the worst of the lot.If we fill up the reservoir with water, it starts draining from every orifice until it is an inch or two below the rim. We checked the instructions, but could find no indication that it was supposed to be doing this.When we added the amount of water the instructions indicated, it only made about half the amount of espresso it should have, and if we added some extra water, it sometimes overflowed the carafe. We were completely frustrated with the inconsistency of the unit.The only thing positive thing I can say is that the reservoir cap is very sturdy.We have returned it and will go back to Capresso. That one never drained water or overflowed the carafe."
2,If you like froth this you will have to toss!,This is an alright maker. The problem is that you can not fit the glass carafe or any normal sized mug under the frother. The nozzle does not extend beyond the machine and there is simply not enough room to get a mug under let alone move it up and down to froth the milk. I regret my purchase.
2,Cheaply made but OK in a pinch,We have a different primary home model that we use daily and only bought this for traveling. I feel it's very cheaply made and find it disappointing that you need to add water each time you want to brew. We made it work but would never have this as our primary home espresso maker.
4,Great Product for the Price!,"Wanted great tasting cappuccinos and lattes without the headache sticker price of most espresso machines. Foamer works great (could be longer, only complain) and shots of espresso come out perfectly."
3,how does the steamer work?,"Can someone please tell me how to get it to steam milk? I have had a delonghi machine before that was a different model but super easy to use and made great lattes. This one I just got, and it seems much less intuitive. I turned the steamer knob with the milk under the steamer spout thing, but nothing happened. Anyone know how to work it?"
1,Negative Review,I would not recommend this machine. It has a flaw that it does not have the option to have the machine on without having the coffee brewing. Thus the coffee does not pour hot into the cup. It pours warm instead of hot. I personally enjoy coffee with a little foam on top from the actual brewing and this coffee comes out with no froth. I would recommend a machine with the option of having the machine on so it can warm up the water and then with an additional switch that gives you the option of when to begin brewing.
3,So...So,You can't steam milk and make coffee at the same time (that's for sure). The expresso comes out flat with no foam on the top. The coffee is OK for a latte type drink. I would not reccommend it for expresso drinkers.
1,espresso maker,"My 10+ year old DeLonghi espresso maker developed a leak so I thought I'd give this one a try. I didn't want to spend hundreds and liked the looks. The feature I didn't like most was part that holds the metal basket of coffee into the machine was made of plastic. After using it about 5 times, the plastic showed wear. I returned this coffee maker."
4,Not Bad,"Not a bad little machine. The frother is tough to get used to, but all in all it brews a great cup of joe."
1,stupid machine,"I just got this machine for Christmas as a gift. I was so excited at beginning, but after I got back home and played with it, I got really mad. First of all, it was difficult to put on the filter holder. Then, the cappuccino nozzle did a ery bad job. I tried to make it work for 4 times, but no good lucks. I have decided to return this stupid machine."
1,One Star too many - Warning - Stay Back.,"A warning label should be applied to this model advising not to purchase it. This is litarally a piece of junk. Seriously. If you do not mind wrangling with the misplaced steaming wand and standing far enough away from the system in order not to get splattered with the brewing esspresso, then this is for you. Me on the other hand prefer not to dodge spraying esspresso while using it or spending five extra minutes cleaning up the mess it just made. This lousy piece of junk brews super slow and during the entire cycle splatters esspresso all over the place within a three foot radious. UNAVOIDABLE. I've tried everything to stop it by even drapping a super absorbent towl over the unit. Stay away from purchasing this machine unless you have the desire to look like a spotted cheetah. Get yourself a Krup as it out performs this thing and costs less too."
4,Good for a first time espresso machine buyer,"Overall this is a well made espresso machine, does a great job brewing good product, but my only hang up is the placement of the steam nozzle for steaming milk. Its in an akward place, but I just use a pyrex measuring cup and it works just fine."
4,Great,"It's really great. I loved my machine, however, I have to warm the cups before making the coffee, otherwise, until the proccess ends, the coffee won't be that hot."
1,Country of manufacture: NOT Italy,"This rating is in no way based on actually using the machine. I ordered this machine thinking, ""A cheap espresso machine NOT made in China? Too good to be true!"" Indeed, I was right. Although the ""country of manufacture"" info given on Amazon says Italy, the machine itself says: Made in P.R.C. right on the bottom. That = People's Republic of China = Made in China. I try my best not to buy goods made in China, especially not large plastic things! So, alas, although I anticipated this machine's arrival, I will not be using it."
1,Do Not Recommend,"Cheep plastic Steam Nnob melted on first use, where is the safety ? The old saying you get what you pay for is correct here. Price looks good, the the Quality is very poor. If you want a Espresso Maker pay the price and get a quality one."
3,Disappointment,"I was e-mailed the You Tube performance of this concert by a friend.... Thinking the DVD would be the same, I bought it.. What a disappointment.. The title states: Radio City Hall Live in New York... but there was none of the focusing on the Orchestra Players, the Vocalists, nor, and for me this was a disaster, no close-ups of some of the audience re-actions... The lady who, right near the beginning, who seems to gasp, and places her hand on her chest, in an expression of sheer delight.... The mature age gentleman whom the camera caught twice.. I felt his eyes were 'misty' on the first 'spot'.. then after the person seated next to him spoke, he nodded his head.... The lady who was singing along with the song.... and so on.... One cannot deny the brilliant interpretation that Mr.Rieu gives the song, for it 'spoke' to me.. but such a pity that I could not feel as 'one' with some of the audience re-actions shown....."
5,A Special from New York City!,"Any show by Rieu is bound to be special listening and watching, but this one captured my full attention and is the best...especially his violin and the music of Frank Sinatra. Always fun to watch and hear, New York City should be proud to have had him and his entertainers live in the Big Apple."
2,NOT one of A R's tipical concerts!! NOT a keeper!!,"A black toddler starts off playing ""Dance of the Fireflies"" and then Andre plays the Godfather Waltz. Then a black Harlem choir sings with Andre playing classical and romantic classical. Afterwards they jointly played some nice religious songs but this is definitely not one of his typical concerts."
4,Ground breaking original,"The first PBBB album and John Mayall's 'Hard Road' album turned me onto the blues. This album was ground breaking with its long solos and 'improvisation'. The 'I've got a mind to give up living' track is my all time personal favourite, with Mike Bloomfield showing a never since repeated depth of feel and talent. The other tracks worth the price are 'Work Song' and 'East-West' although time as diminished their impact. Personally, the first album stands the test of time better and shows what great talents Paul Butterfield and Mike Bloomfield were."
2,Over rated,99% of these reviews are written by people who replaced the OEM belt with one of these. Which means they're comparing the cheapest belt the OEM could buy to an over priced thing.I've compared these belts to GOOD v belts and don't see any advantage in terms of vibration dampening.A Gates Cogged Hi-Power belt runs about 1/4 of the price of these and produces the same amount of vibration. In addition to this at the same tension (ie not stressing the motor) the link belt was more prone to slippage when the tool was loaded down than the Hi-Power.
5,Great workout,"I love Denise Austin's DVD's. She is so positive and encouraging, it feels like she is in the living room with me."
3,"Too fast, little focus on form","Con: Her choreography moves very quickly; I prefer to move more slowly but ensure proper form. More than once, women on the DVD were doing lunges with their knees too far forward.Con: Some of her strengthening moves had me swinging the weights in large arcs with less-controlled movements.Pro: The music sounds like it was made by a real person, not a computer, which is refreshing from other DVD's.Pro: The circuits are not too repetitive."
2,Dishes aren't dry OR clean,"Well, this is not a top of the line dishwasher, which the price reflects, I suppose. But I HATE having to scrub my dishes before putting them in the dishwasher. And I mean I have to get everything off the dishes first. If I leave a speck of, say, mayonnaise on a knife, it will be there when the cycle is done! And, as the other review says, the dishes are pretty wet when done. Glass somehow gets sort of dry (but not really), but anything plastic doesn't dry at all and I have to wipe everything down when it's done. Now I don't know about you, but it seems to defeat the purpose of having a dishwasher when you have to hand wash your dishes before putting them in and hand dry them when they're done!"
3,It was an amazing story! Sad too!,"The book is about a girl named Bridget that is 14 years old and was adopted. She had a brother named Morgan that doesn't speak. Her and Morgan go into the woods and spot a house. They keep going to it, while making excuses to her adoptive dad that they were going for walks. Bridget never knew that this house was the house of her parents. She meets a girl named Elissa that reveals what her parents were like and who they were. This mystery novel will make you so interested, you will want to read it all over again. To find out more about the book and what happens and all the details, you have to read it. Believe me you won't be sorry for reading it. I'm in 6th grade and I loved it. I hope you do to."
5,Good update,"I have been wearing this version of New Balance running shoes for nine years with no problems. I have wide feet, and these fit perfectly and offer great support."
4,Double the Genre - Double the Fun,"The brilliance of AIP was that they didn't merely make an indie film - like Miramax, they made Indie genres. Any other studio would be happy with only one Two headed creature movie on the slate. But Sam Arkoff knew that a year later, the drive-in audience would be begging for a second - second head film. I remember as a kid hearing about these amazing films.Who would imagine that Casey Kasem and Bruce Dern would be acting against each other in ""The Incredible Two-Headed Transplant."" But they're not sharing heads in this classic. Arkoff knew that the audience wanted to see a two headed superstar in the second flick and a year later, he gave us ""The Thing With Two Heads"" featuring Oscar winner Ray Milland and football superstar Rosie Grier sharing a body and a motorcycle.And for Munster fans, you get to see Pat Priest.The great part about the Midnite Movie Double Features series is that you get entire 2 headed grafted 70s genre in one box."
5,Hard to find!,"This movie was very hard to find, but this vendor came through for me! I would not hesitate to do business with them again."
3,Decent. Nothing spectactular.,"OK for quick study, locating key words. A few errors, in my opinion, as well as some controversial statements."
2,Horse Tradin',Well I expected more out of this book. The stories were long and drawn out. I do not think I would purchase any of Greens other books. Maybe I picked the wrong one to read first.
5,THESE DAYS ARE GONE,"GREEN HAS BEEN THERE AND DONE IT, BUT BETTER YET HE CAN RELATE IT TO THE READER WITH OUT TOO MUCH ENHANCEMENT."
2,Disappointing,"The previous reviews point to a really satisfying read. I didn't get that.At best it is a social commentary on the penal system, but appears to be the same-old, same-old:- prisoners with nothing to lose fight over crude things,- rampant homosexuality and brutality (usually together),- squalid living conditions,- Big Brother watching all,- main character is very familiar: wrongly accused of a a crime, dishonest/biased judiciary system sentences him to life on a remote island.- reader coerced into picking a side to win in the ultimate struggle for controlGot about half way before I just couldn't be bothered reading anymore. I guess I expected some interesting twist on a story that has been told many times before."
4,good,"Sometimes a little hard t keep up with author.A little jumpy on the big events,happened really quickly withour much detail."
3,Interesting,"I found this book to be interesting, but not deserving of 4 or 5 stars that most readers gave it. At times it was a little hard to follow. But at the end it turned out the way I hoped it would."
3,PENAL COLONY,THIS WAS A VERY GOOD BOOK. MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT HOW TERRIBLE THINGS WERE WAY BACK WHEN..HOW COULD ANY EVER SURVIVE IN THIS KIND OF ENVIRMENT AND COME OUT HUMAN.. REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK
4,Pleasantly surprised,"Intelligently written, with believable characters and dialogue. A decent, mild-mannered man who has taken the modern, civilized man's life of relative ease and convenience for granted is thrust into a world of depravity and violence, and must learn how to survive. And he learns much more besides. It was good enough that I will seek out more work by this author. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book, especially for the current $3 price."
5,An awesome read,"A great futuristic prison book. Once you start reading, you won't be able to put it down. Lots of action and excellent dialogue. The movie No Escape was based on the book. However, the book is tens times better. Enjoy."
4,LIFE INSIDE THE WALLS,"Interesting concept of prison with no bars, and understanding how they survived by creating a community of trust. The book kept me interested and reading but dropped off at the end.. wishing for more."
5,Makes you feel as if you are there!,I just got a kindle and this is the first book I downloaded. It really makes you feel as if you are right there on the island. You can feel the fear and shock of the characters. I found myself thinking about it all the time. It was actually on the free list so I didn't pay anything for it.
3,The future or the present.,A totally unexpected storyline based on what could happen or might be and we do not know about yet.A very engrossing story. Worth reading
4,Intense Book,This story kept my interest until the end. I like the main character and story line. There are some very graphic rape parts that I didn't like to read before I went to sleep. I enjoyed the idea that even the worst criminals can have a good and a bad side of the tracks.
2,Review for penal colony,"I didn't like this one, kept finding myself skimming through pages. Could have been more action and I wouldn't recommend this book."
5,Very Few Available,"I live in a very salty and acidic environment (Big Island, Hawaii). You would think that for those of us who live near the ocean that rust free products would be readily available. They are not! I had to go to great lengths and finally found just what I was looking for on Amazon. These fixtures have been absolutely great! No rust No corrosion."
4,Enjoyed this video,I have not done a lot of yoga before I became pregnant but this was a very enjoyable workout. I liked all of the variations depending on which trimester you are in and how you are feeling. I not only could feel my body working I also felt a great stretch for my whole body which really relaxed me by the end. I would recommend this to other pregnant women.
3,I need motivation!,"I was doing a little yoga before my pregnancy (in preparation for the 3rd trimester, actually), so this seemed like a natural fit. Maybe... but I rarely felt inclined to watch it, must less do it. It's almost like they expected everyone to be fully prepared to throw their pregnant bodies into all kinds of positions -- not me! I WANTED to, but I wasn't prepared to. Give me a little more motivation, please! Then maybe I would have been inspired to complete these programs."
2,not a favorite,"This video falls into the category of: seems like they did it in one take. The main problem is the instructor. She makes numerous grammatical mistakes, doesn't explain certain things well, and makes ""off-the-cuff"" remarks that seem staged. I don't know if there are better yoga videos out there (I bought this one since its reviews were better than most), but this is NOT something I happily reach for. One caveat: this may be the snobbery of someone with several yoga studios within walking distance. If your fitness access is limited and you're not picky, it is certainly better than no yoga."
4,very different work out,"I LOVED that this even had the oh-so-important kegal exercises. I found mucles I didn't know I had. The actual work out is very mild. It has a meditation session at the end. I liked it, although she seemed a little cheesey. Really centered and relaxed me though."
4,A little too drawn out,"I was drawn into the personal story but felt it was too long. Also, I read to be entertained and not to have someone's political views forced on me. The author definitely had an agenda and for that reason, I would probably not read another one of his books."
2,Why The Five Stars?,"I am surprised by the five star reviews on this book and I am puzzled by the comments of other reviewers claiming this book is ""brilliant"". To be honest, I have only read the book 1/4 of the way through so my review probably isn't very objective but I have lost track of the characters in the novel and I am thoroughly confused. The characters and period of time jump from the late 1800's to the late 1900's and it is like starting a new novel with each chapter. Perhaps I will just archive this book temporarily and try reading it again at a later date. If I decide I wasn't fair in my review thus far, I will submit a retraction of my comments and publish another review."
2,Be Careful,"Ok dont get me wrong, these speakers are nice, great bass response. Only problem is, about 2 months after owning them, one of the speakers just quit working. I have had the hardest time trying to get ahold of M-Audio. 24/7 assistance? I think not. I have read story after story of people with the same problems. Please be weary. Save your money and look into a set of yamaha monitors, or even something else. When it comes to quality and longevity M-Audio is not on my list. Please don't make the same mistake i did. I am regretting this purchase every day i have to listen to my one working speaker while i try to get ahold of customer support..."
5,Jeff conquers the cube in 45 seconds: And you can too!,"This book works! I am a 40+ year old woman and I did it over and over again. It is important to read through the begining to understand what each step means. After that, it is easy. I'm not quite able to memorize all of the steps yet but I can do it very simply with the book on hand. I would say buy this book and then memorize it and freak out your friends. When I have it memorized I am going to put my cube on my desk just to watch everyone's faces as I solve it right in front of them!!!!!!!"
1,delta 23-710 sharpening system,"This tool does not do what it says it can. None of my chisels or lathe tools reached the stone properly when on the tool rest as it did not travel low enough. Also there is a vibration in it that only went away if you loosened the nut on top of the wetstone (thereby making it useless). The wetstone is driven by a plastic gear that didn't inspire much confidence in the longevity of the tool. The large stone itself is very soft and seems like it will wear out too soon and is about $50 to replace. That being said, I love my Contractor's saw and old delta/milwaukee bandsaw. Built to last."
2,"Slop, slop and more slop!",One word describes the adjustments on this tool - SLOPPY! All of the adjustments have too much play. You really have to tinker with them to get the machine to hold a tool correctly.
1,If I could give it zero stars I would,This particular author appears to be attempting to prove to the world how much she knows about rock bands without looking at them (and the culture) objectively. Congradulations to her for attending alot of concerts but I guess a degree doesn't really mean everything these days.
5,Surprisingly Entertaining!,"Long-Term Greedy: The Triumph of Goldman Sachs was a satisfying read on many levels. While there is considerable business analysis (and my background is in science), the concepts and terms are described well and enlightening. But what I enjoyed most was the story aspect. The cast of characters included the people from the 1980's headlines. Lindskoog introduces them as Goldman confronts them on behalf of its clients. He describes how Goldman initially struggles, but ultimately triumphs when faced with the unorthodox tactics of the 1980's. There's even a moral: stick with your principles. I did not expect such a book to be so entertaining! Well done!!"
3,"Very insightful, but there are better guides for job seekers","While I found Long Term Greedy insightful in areas, it's also a little out of date. And there is a better guide I found called ""Goldman Sachs"" by Vault Reports that job seekers and Wall Street employees would find more interesting and up-to-date."
5,This Left Feels RIGHT!,I LOVE this dvd!!! I think it just adds to the evidence that Bon Jovi is the greatest band out there! They take songs we all know and love and totally revamp them into something new... it's like an entirely new collection of songs. You have to think of them as NEW songs and not re-dos or you won't enjoy this. If you can let go of the oldies for a couple of hours you'll love this dvd! Jon is super hot in it too! The lounge style of singing definitely works for him! I give it two thumbs way way up!
3,Not as good as the Halloween one,"This is a nice book, telling stories of many Christmas symbols from an historical, rather than religious standpoint. I don't think it's quite as entertaining or easy to read as the Halloween book though, which is really, really good."
4,Pretty enjoyable,"Although not as good as the best Renaissance or Annie Haslam, it is still pretty good. I liked it a lot better the 2nd listen than the first so I guess it grows on you. The voice is the same and the material is good although not great. Definitely a rare hard to find item for the hard core fan."
5,I Like Cats,"My daughter checked this book out at school.She loved it so much, and hated to return it to the library, so I ordered it for her for Christmas.What a great story about liking cats with awesome illustrations to go with it.I highly recommend it for anyone, cat lovers or not!"
2,britannia collection gift box set,"really cute, but they're TINY! based on photo, thought they'd be larger (ie able to acutally use to store tea). these are almost too small to even be decorations. i bought them for a gift and now am very hesitant to give them. they'd be lost on a shelf (whether display or storage).disappointed the product description didn't include measurements.1.75"" Wide x 2.5"" Tall"
3,a promising beginning but,"After the frist hundred pages, this novel falls into repetition without interesting variations. Longueur succeeds longueur. The characters cease developing and the situations become predictable. Only verbal brilliance could save the book.A much niftier book about life in poststructural times on a major American unversity campus is Hynes, The Lecturer's tale. Much more interesting style, plot, and characters."
4,imperials: treasures cd,"if you are looking for a good gospel cd by the imperials, this is it. there is a very well roundedness to the selection of songs from the different albums previous to this one that have been put together on this cd. the song ""i don't have to live there anymore"", is a bonus track on this album that i haven't found on any of their other cds. if you like russ taft or the cathedrals, you will probably like the imperials along with this cd."
4,"Good serial, and a pleasant surprise for Lugosi fans","This 1934 serial is a well-made adventure story, of special interest to Bela Lugosi fans because for once he plays a plausible romantic lead instead of a sinister menace, and he's quite charming in this. A lot of action was packed into the first four chapters (intended to attract exhibitor and audience interest); these are especially good, with fine end-of-chapter perils. (For those who haven't got time for the entire serial, a feature version was fashioned from the first four chapters.)"
5,"Higly recommended, emotionally engaging book!","This was an outstanding and emotional story of forgiveness and of learning to forgive yourself. It's about overcoming childhood problems and mistakes and forging ahead to find love and happiness again. It's not just a sappy romance story though, there's quite a lot of mystery, sabatoge, adventure and revenge involved too. I respected Rhys from the outset and couldn't help liking Brina and all the secondary characters (except John, of course). Their story captivated me and they'll remain in my thoughts for days to come."
4,The Sea - A Class Apart,"Coming to this book with some previous knowledge as to Banvilles reputation I was thrilled to read a fine, imaginative and extremely interesting work. Set in a countryside that I know well, The Sea captured memories of a time and place and interwove it with characters that were ""real"". In my view this novel merits its awards and allows every reader to enjoy the work of a fine novelist.It is very much a class apart from many others."
3,Good but not that good.,"This book did not deserve the Man Booker Prize. Kazuo Ishiguro's ""Never Let Me Go"" and Zadie Smith's ""On Beauty"" were far more deserving. I mean who really cares about that weird, shallow, pretentious family anyway. I guess the bigger your words the better your chances of winning the Booker. Enjoyable summer reading but not prize worthy."
2,Would have been better as a short story,"I have read several books by John Banville, and this one I think could have benefited heavily from some editing. The author seems to enjoy creating prose more than conveying any particular ideas or creating characters. This book seems like a scetch that leaves you with the impression that you almost see a picture, but when you stop to think about it it's just a few rough lines on a page torn out of a notebook."
2,Poor Booker choice,"Up until the last quarter of this book it would barely have rated 1 star. The denouement made the book interesting. I agree with previous reviewers that the Booker was awarded for all the ""big"" words. Sadly Kazuo Ishiguro was ripped off, as ""Never Let Me Go"" was a much better book. Then again, ""Atonement"" also missed out a few years ago."
2,"It's Like I'm Stranded In the Ocean and It Never, Ever Ends","...and I mean that in the most excruciating way. I believe some writers get lost in the words and the construction of sentences before they realize that they don't have a plot. So, with about 25 pages left, they throw in a twist, the pay-off, that has been projected, painfully, for a few hundred, tedious, ponderous, and stupefying pages. I had just read 500 pages of Margaret Atwood's ""The Blind Assassin"", another Man Booker Prize winner with incredible writing, an unlikable narrator and a missing plot, before I picked up this John Banville novel. Thankfully, it was, at least, short. Ostensibly about death and the nature of memory, I found it to be meandering and confusing. Obviously a terribly gifted writer, with sentences that beg to be read again and again, I just think that being able to manipulate words isn't enough to garner the praise it deserves, much less a Booker Prize."
5,Your Rottweilers Life,"I recommend this book to anyone that is thinking of buying an Rottweiler or to anyone that is new to the breed. I find that the information is up to date, accurate, and very instructive. Ms Dearth gives advice on all aspects of ownership and many humorous insights into the personality of this breed. I sincerely hope that anyone thinking about adding a Rottweiler to their family, will read this book first!"
1,not happy,My daughter was so excited to get this rolling backpack. The amount of books she has to carry was hurting her back. The item lasted until last week (week before Thanksgiving) when she told me that one of the wheels was not rolling good any more and the straps had torn off at the bottom so she couldn't even put it on her back. The wheels are too small and it looks like they got worn by the concrete. One of the leg props fell off within a couple of weeks too. This is not a strong enough backpack to be put thru the day to day travel of a 6th grader. I wonder how they tested this item before they started selling it. I would not buy this again and it makes me nervous about other products that look the same. I thought for $30 that is would have lasted thru the school year at least instead of just 1 month.
5,Sharp Bits without buying new ones,Received the Drill Doctor last weekend and after watching the video tape that was included I was sharpening bits sharper than when I purchased them. If you find yourself buying new bits often than this product will pay for itself in no time.
4,a must read for educators!,"sonia nieto does an extraordinary job of conveying not only the notion of multiculturalism, but also the understanding of what it takes to teach in a multicultural arena. nieto accurately describes the learning process as a reciprocal process between students and teachers, and students as teachers. nieto discusses the notion of ""culture"" as a verb, which i think is quite appropriate. the use of personal narratives, as well as her own experience as an educator in poor, urban areas, was very insightful and uplifting. one thing that struck me as prophetic, while seemingly obvious, was her statement ""in order to become a multicultural teacher you must first be a multicultural person."" well said. and well written."
2,Worked for a while...,"Worked for a while, then it split in two sepparate places, both places being glue joints between the slats. The larger of the two splits is large enough to allow juice drainage from the well under the board onto the counter. I might as well use my plastic veggie board that doesn't have a well, because this well is useless now and the wood doesn't stay in place as well on the corian countertop as the plastic board does."
5,Great product,"This camera is very easy to use, and it has a wide veriety of features. The dial makes it easy to switch from different modes. And the eye control helps to make each shot focused on your desired subject."
1,Murder mystery that goes NOWHERE!,Hoping for a good murder mystery? Forget about it! This isn't it. Spare yourself some agony and don't read it. A word to the author: don't sell yourself as a mystery writer when you don't have the guts to give your readers a worthwhile ending.
3,"""Interactive"" is a bit strong","My five year old daughter had a lot of fun with this for about two days. It could not understand either her or me well enough to give the correct responses (we both speak clearly)to the prompts - and you mest ask specific questions, and will receive certain responses in return. Not very spontaneous and does not interact with the dolls."
1,Osteoporosis Prevention,"This book has a SOME good information. HOWEVER, this important information is assimilated by a layperson, not a medical expert who works with patients and emerging research on a daily basis. The book is poorly presented and edited. MUCH better books are ""Osteoporosis for Dummies,"" ""Reversing Osteopenia,"" and ""Action Plan for Osteoporosis."" Most importantly, be sure and discuss your questions with a medical specialist--don't rely on any of these books to self-diagnose or self-treat. The author's gem and personal analogies fall flat and are distracting in this book.P.S. Like the author, I am a patient with osteoporosis, a writer, and have done extensive research on the subject."
5,cable review,"I compared using this cable with an actual HDMI cable when hooking up my Playstation. The pure HDMI has a very subtle improved picture to the DVI/HDMI, but I had heard that this occurs from other online info. So with that said for the price I payed for this cable it is well worth the money and don't pay the ridiculous price tag for more expensive cables!!!"
2,Poor quality but it works,Cable is exactly what it is. A working cheap cable. Would probably put up the bucks and get a good one next time.
5,"works great, but what version?","The cable works great, and it's sooo cheap. I only wish I knew if it was hdmi v1.3."
2,"Feels cheap, quality just ok","I have purchased other items from Cables Unlimited and am mostly very happy with my purchases. I am a firm believer in not paying more than you have to for cables, and overpriced cables are nothing but a rip off. However this cable was a disappointment.The plastic feels cheap and britle, and the signal quality was worse than that of VGA. I compared a VGA connection to this connection using a top of the line PC with a high end video card, on a 46"" 1080p LCD tv. The HDMI signal was awful, whereas the VGA was crystal clear.I do not recommend this cable."
2,"not for me, but somebody else","This is designed for something i don't use. It works well as a DVI to HDMI cable, but I misunderstood my laptop, which doesn't have a DVI port to plug into. So i am stuck with 11 bucks worth of nothing useful, due to my own incompetence, not the quality of the product."
5,Same quality as monster cables at far less than the price.,"Forget Monster Cables, buy this and stop feeding the big company who jack up the prices on cables."
1,"Bad Cables, Bad Customer Service","Cables would not work, and customer service would not reply my email asking for a replacement.Will not buy from this company again and will warn all my frineds and family to stay away from them!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Used it For XBOX 360 to Computer LCD,"Cable does the job as advertisted, was able to run the HDMI out on my XBox 360 to the DVI-D input on my Computer LCD."
5,GREAT BUY - Don't Spend $$$$$ on other cables,I have had this cable for 2 years I use it to connect my desktop to my TV it works really great it has a vivid picture. Very clear and cripst I mistreat the cable and it still works. This cable has no problems you will not be sorry if you get it.Enjoy.
1,"Worthless, lost everything!","We bought this and got it all set up, no big problems. We used it for less than two months and then the hard drive physically failed. I took it to firedog within Circuit City to see if they could recover the data, and nothing, sure enough the guy said there was a failure within the mechanics of the hard drive itself. Over a years worth of work lost. I am really frustrated with this product and we're replacing it with a Seagate that has a 5 year warranty. Never going for this brand again! Don't waste your money, time or put anything important on this hard drive!"
2,Snooze Wood,"I came into this movie expecting something other than what was delivered and I suspect that this may have impacted my overall enjoyment of the movie. From the very beginning Wake Wood has a truncated quality to it which makes it difficult for the viewer to connect with the poorly realized characters and their situation -- almost as if the film makers felt that the initial tragedy would be sufficient to buy the viewers interest and sympathy for the whole of the movie.Wake Wood inhabits an uneasy space between a mystery, occult thriller, and slasher film and manages to fail on all three counts though if it had simply focused on the occult thriller aspect there were a number of intriguing ideas that were barely explored and seemed to exist as window dressing though they were by far the most interesting aspects of the film."
2,"Okay I guess, Definitely NOT scary","The movie was alright, kinda cheesy with some of the dramaticness but overall was not a scary movie. I'm sure this is in taste for some but if you really want to feel scared or get that ""edge of the seat"" feeling, this isn't the movie."
2,"Some good points, but...","On the plus side, this book succeeds at being distinct from other Tull books in certain respects. For example, a chapter is devoted to fairly long interviews with various (mostly past) Tull members. The photo gallery was also replete with pictures I have not seen. Unfortunately, the writing is somewhat amateurish and the editing/proofreading is even worse. In my first ten minutes or so I identified over 20 typographical errors and mistakes in grammar. An example is the author's CONSTANT misuse of the contraction ""it's"" in place of the possessive ""its"". Overall, I would not recommend it."
2,Mixed feelings about this book,"Ms. O'Faolain is, beyond a doubt, a gifted writer. Unfortunately, this book isn't the best showcase of her talents. She seems to view herself as a witness to her own life; her academic accomplishments are ascribed to various ""patrons"" who helped her get scholarships rather than hard work on her own part. We know all about the men she slept with and the pubs she visited, but she never gets around to naming all of her siblings. And while she might feel that witnessing W.H. Auden eating an egg at Oxford gives her some startling insight into his character, the meaning escapes me. It certainly says nothing about her.For all her talk of freeing herself from the restrictive life that Irish women were expected to live until recently, Nuala O'Faolain comes across as an extraordinarily passive woman."
4,Every Woman Should Read This Book,"This is a book every woman should read. It is an excellent historical account of the difference between generations of families. It is a deep revelation about family relationships.For young women, especially, who have lives not so different from their mothers should make this a must read. It is a very personal history of what it was like to live through the women's movement."
2,"Some advice, Nuala - Get some Prozac!","This memoir was deeply unsatisfying. While I like the way she writes and crafts words, I found her to be uninspiring and pretentious, to say the least."
2,Not a winner,"I read this book as part of a book group. I found it boring and pretenious. The author would have done a much better job if she spent more time on a specific event, rather than racing through general situations. She skipped around a lot so it was very difficult to remember who was whom, or to even care."
5,I understand me by meeting Nuala,"One of the most powerful books I have ever read. I came away with a richer understanding of my own Irish Catholic background. Even though I was raised in the USA by parents of Irish descent, the cultural influence was strong. Being taught by nuns from an Irish order also had a tremendous impact on who I am. I think many women would see a part of themselves in Nuala's story--so many women are driven by a need to feel love and for many of us, it's because we didn't feel love even though our Irish parents claimed to have loved us. As an adult I now understand like Nuala that my parents were just ordinary people who were the products of their own unaffectionate families. They gave me what they themselves were given. I do love myself and believe I can recognize love and share it with another human, so i must have gotten some from my family."
5,"Deserves a skyful of stars, not just 5!","I bought the cassette tape way back in the 1980s when it was a newborn. Through twenty years and countless playings, not once has it failed to delight, quieten the soul and uplift the spirit, and make me thank God that Ian Tyson was born and that he shares his gifted voice and songs with us. Never was a cowboy born who wouldn't have loved the heartstring pulling and honest songs that Ian says he ""tries to write"" in Springtime. Rockies Turn Rose and Own Heart's Delight rival any songs, anywhere, for top hand status."
1,Terrible battery life,"This battery last less time than the 1 year old one that it was purchased to replace. I won't even make it through 1/2 a day, it came in new packaging but this lasts no where as long as a new battery should."
1,Battery not recommendable too OLD,"old battery not recommended, I charge it for 6hours and last for only 8 hours, my old one last 14 hours, I bought this because a new one lats around 36 to 40 hours. BIG time dissapointment."
3,"Good, but NOT sharp.","No complaints with the quality, except if you are looking for SHARP Cheddar, this is more like VERY MILD. Almost to the point of lacking a cheese-like tast."
4,good movie,"Overall I'd say it was a good movie. Good plot and effects, but too much technical jargon for the average movie watcher. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat."
5,'95 Protege 8000K HID Conversion,"Received my lights today the only things missing were the ""10 tie wraps, 2 pcs double-sided tape, and 1 installation guide"" (items 6, 7, &8 in the instruction guide). Nothing missing was critical, I had my own zip-ties, the mounting brackets work better than tape, and I didn't even need an installation guide. Also, the shipping time was around 7 or 8 days, not the best but this wasn't the only package I ordered last week that took a little longer than expected to arrive. Other than that, I couldn't be happier with my order. The lights work as expected, fit as specified, and are MORE than bright enough. Very pleased."
5,Great toy!,"If you like Lincoln Logs and trains, you can't go wrong. My only suggestion is to get a big bucket of Lincoln Logs with it so you can build more stuff with it. My 4 year old loves it!"
3,"A fair survey, but could be more organized.","This is a fair survey book. It covers parity space, the likelihood ratio approach, and other approaches. It starts by giving the big picture.It can be better organized, however, and movement from chapter to chapter can be better motivated."
4,Maps,excellent account of the Germans last offensivewould have been helped by having more Germanpersonal accountsNeed more maps to follow the action
5,Incredible Album!,This album is what every music listener needs in there CD player. Don't waste another minute of your life. Buy this album today...right now...and be blessed by what you experience.
2,Heroes of Iwo Jima,"Excellent detail to a time in our history when our young Marines gave their all to preserve our freedom. This shows why it was said ""Uncommon Valor Was a Common Virtue"".This deseves 5 stars and not the 2 showing."
2,Inconceivable,"How did the production company manage to land two of the best actor's in recent cinema history? Not to mention, Darryl Hannah, Bokeem Woodbine, and Balthazar Getty. The script was dull, the plot was unoriginal, and the production quality was very low-budget. The only reason I gave it two stars was Val Kilmer's portrayal of a very eccentric character which was marginally entertaining. Don't buy this movie, don't rent this movie, don't ever watch this movie. Trust me, you don't want to equate this movie to Val Kilmer's or Christian Slater's acting careers."
1,"Tried it, don't!","This raised toilet seat has sharp edges where the skin meets the plastic. I would recommend a ""sloped or curved"" seat and maybe 1/2"" lower for shorter people."
4,Very helpful,I have a disability and most toilets are extremely low and with this device I am comfortable.
5,A great addition to my eclectic libray,"I grew up with the lead guitarist in the band. Elementary school band together. He played trumpet back then.I was surprised to discover he played guitar, years after graduation. From track star to rock star. :)I like the album. Clear influences from the bands we grew up listening too in the mid to late 70's."
5,Definitely Heavy Duty,Bought this to cover my new Kenmore grill. Its a great cover with thick felt lining. Velcro straps keep the cover tight on the grill. This cover survived hurricane Sandy on my rear deck.
5,Durable cover,"My last cover was worn after two years in the outdoors. This seems like a good replacement. I have a small propane grill with two burners and small work spaces on each side. It was one of those you for under $100 at the start of the summer. It is sturdy and thick, I think this will last another two years. It already withstood a tropical storm."
3,Dark Side of the Moon,"From twelve thousand dollars for the horse, tack, etc., to twelve hundred dollars later in the book, I sort of lost interest. Too many mistakes in writing and too many typos. Laura also has too many troubles. Not really well-written books. What was T. Jefferson Parker thinking?!"
1,This book is really bad,The author is all over the place. There are stories within the story that make no sense. The characters are all over the place. I knew who the killer was almost immediately. Kept reading to see if it would get more interesting. Finally skipped the last 40% of the book to get to the end. I was right about the killer. This book isn't worth a $1.00
2,Don't waste your money on this book - BORING!!!,"I was really hoping to enjoy this new author because book reviewers and critics gave winning comments. I was bored to death, pushed myself to finish reading it so I could give an accurate review, but I was very disappointed. I live in Arizona where this book is based, and actually felt like it was some kind of travel manual. There were far too many details and not enough story line.The first chapter of any novel should grab the reader and leave them wanting more. In this case, the reader has no clue what the 1st chapter has to do with the story line until long into the book. In fact, the book's description is completly misleading to the real story. The author did a poor job of giving the reader enough clues to keep the story moving. It begins with a double murder, but that isn't even the main plot. To cut to the chase.Is it worth buying?Absolutely not. In my opinion, it isn't even worth checking out from the library if that were an option."
4,omnijig review,"I bought a 7116 omnijig and a adjustable through dovetail template from Tool Crib and the first one came to me with a grossly deformed aluminum casting. I don't know how it ever made it past quality control because I noticed the defect as soon as I opened the box. I called Tool Crib and they had UPS come and pick it up at no expence to me. Fed EX delivered the second one and a look at the box had me worried. It was badly damaged, and upon opening it I saw that the styrofoam packing was completly destroyed. Luckly there was no damage to the omnijig.I watched the video (it seemed intimidating) but I started to play with it and get familiar with it. After about 4 hours of set up and making test cuts I made 8 drawers.They came out OK for my first attempt. I think if I buy some good measuring instruments to make set up more precise and easier and after getting more familiar with this jig it will become easy to use and will produce quality joinery."
4,A Good Introduction to the Yankee Dynasty,"This book is a solid read on the first year of the famous yankees dynasty of the 1990's. It gives us inside look at the 1996 team from it construction to the World Series win.My only negative comment is that at time I thought it could have been written better. There were some dull parts that I skimmed through.Nevertheless, it is a good and quick reas that I think all Yankee fans will enjoy."
2,"One of my wife's favorite, thought I would never find it on DVD.","Great movie, one that we have watched many times. The quality of DVD recording is poor at best. My old VHS has a better picture. It's a 5-Star movie on a 1-Star DVD."
1,THIS STINKS,"I got this Intec PSP Safe Case thinking it looks pretty good how the psp fits perfectly without any space. I was definitely wrong. A lot of flaws are in this product. It is much too bulky, and to tell you, it's not really protecting your psp. There is a lot of space between the sides of the case, and if you drop the case, it pops open 100% of the time (even from 2 feet above the ground). When I test dropped it, I could just feel the psp getting damaged. I'm telling you, it stinks!!! If you want a great case, get a Playgear Pocket. 99% of all psp owners who have a case have a Playgear Pocket. It has the shape of the psp and is a lot less bulky. You can charge the psp while its in the case!!!! It feels like you are just holding the psp, except you have a full proof protection around it. You can even put pictures inside the Playgear pocket so you can see them. It's basically a decal thing. Do me a favor, just don't get the Intec PSP Safe Case. Thank you."
3,Good not Great,"A good product, but nothing was said about it running only on batteries! What a joke. If your child leaves it on, it's dead. This product needs an outlet plug. That would make it great."
3,Buy batteries!,"We bought this for our 3 year old son and both he and our 5 year old do play with it, but not for very long. Graphics (in this day and age) could be much better, and woudl prefer it had a power cord rather than just bettery as the betteried won't last long (uses 4 D's and have alreayd changed once since November!)"
3,Dissapointment...,"I read all the good reviews on this toy and then Santa decided to bring one of the Smart Cycles to my 3-year-old daughter for Christmas. The toy runs on batteries with no AC adapter available, so you have to stack on batteries. Graphics are terrible (but the kids don't seem to care.) My daughter needs assistance in pedaling and guidance through the different games. Overall, the Smart Cycle takes a lot of space and after 2 weeks that we have had the toy, my kids are done playing with it."
1,When it works it's fine. Poor quality.,"I just read the reviews for the new Smart Cycle and it says this has a known flaw. Our first one broke a few months after we received it. We received a new one and it worked a little longer than 2 months but it is now broke. The smart cycle does not read the programs. So we cut off the cord and have a stationary bike which the kids use very little. Overall, the quality is a piece of trash. Spend the extra money and get the newer version, unless you want to have a stationary bike for the kids."
1,A huge disappointment,"Santa brought this toy to my then 4 year-old son because we live in an area that snows heavily for 6 to 7 months of the year. He saw commercials and thought it looked fun and we thought it would be good exercise for him. We put it together and after about 15 minutes of riding it, one pedal came off. We were able to put it back on and the other fell off a few minutes later; and it happened immediately again. Time got away from us before we tried to put the other back on, again, and now it won't go back on and it's most likely too late to return it. He literally got about 20 minutes use out of it and it's not the cheapest toy on the block! The idea is great but too cheaply made."
3,expensive but okay,"We bought this toy for our 3 1/2 year old granddaughter to use while we are on our exercise equipment. She gets frustrated with the fact that she cannot go to different levels without going through the beginning ones. We have not run out of batteries yet however, it would be very nice if the cycle were able to have an adaptor as we have not been able to find rechargeable D batteries or a recharger for them. Every recharger seem to be only for smaller batteries. We only bought the one game component that came with the game, as the other boxes said the same thing on them we could not tell if there would be a benefit for harder games or only just a change in visual surroundings."
2,The pedals are too small for kids with long legs,"My son was so excited to see this toy in Toys R Us - and I was anxious to see how he would do with it. He's 3, knows all his letters and numbers, so I wasn't sure he'd really be that into it. He jumped on the bike, was so excited, but he couldn't get the pedals going. He rides a regular bike with no problems whatsoever (and has been for nearly 2 years), but couldn't maneuver the pedals very well at all. The metal parts holding the pedals are too short and make their movements difficult. If you have a child with average to long legs, I would not suggest getting this toy for them. I think educationally it is great and I think the idea of getting kids moving some while playing video games is great, but it needs some improvements for taller kids."
4,Great Fun Educational Toy,"I purchased this item for my nephew, age 4, as a Christmas present. He loves it! It was easy to put together, easy to connect to the TV, and easy for him to play immediately. The only problem we encountered with the product involves the bolts for the pedals. He managed to strip the original bolts in just a couple of days. Thankfully, his grandfather was able to find more well constructed bolts to replace the original set that came with the Smart Cycle. Hopefully, there will be no further problems!"
4,"Love it, but would like to see the following improvements:","My 4 year old LOVES this toy!!However, I have some ideas for some improvements for the next generation of Smartcycle:Add a resistance knob, so that the pedals can be increasingly difficult to push, to give more exercise, instead of freewheeling with no tension.Add a DC output for an AC adaptor.Make a cartridge all about flying, pedaling an ultralight, or space bike.Put in a usb port, and built in hard drive, and give users the ability to download new adventures from a computer website, to keep the toy updated with new games and skills.This is a very cool toy, thank you. It is a big hit in this house!Gail Carson"
2,Not what I hoped,"This is sad because this should have been a great toy. The concept is brilliant. But the graphics are horrible, the games are boring, and I spend time trying to talk my son into playing it just to justify the money I spent on it. The idea of cycling and playing is wonderful and my son prefers riding it just as much when it is not hooked up as he does while it is. He played it a few times when he first got it, but after the first month, never even asks for it even though it is right by the TV ready to go. Wish I hadn't wasted our money, and sad to see it is a top ten wished for toy because I know there will be some frustrated parents and children. It doesn't live up to the hype."
1,Doesn't last long,"I'm sad to say that this bike doesn't last too long. I got it for my first son, he played it a few times (not too much, maybe 20 times in all). We just brought it out for the second kiddo to try and he played it twice and it stopped working all together. The screen garbled and it turned off three times in a row and then it wouldn't turn on anymore. I thought it was the batteries at first, but then I changed them with brand new ones and it still wouldn't turn on. I googled and found that the circuit board has issues and many were returned. Wish I'd known that sooner! I do not recommend this toy, it's quality isn't all that great anyway (but my boys loved it), and then it breaks and makes them sad they can't use it."
2,Boring and not durable,"I got this for my daughter last year christmas present, it only keeps her entertain for about a month. Plus all other kinds of games all have the same format, just diff characters and themes, so she got bore pretty fast. Six months later when her friends try to play, it kept froze up and now couldn't play anymore."
4,Fun Fun Fun,We got the Smart Cycle for our 3 year old son and he loves it. My guy is a little on the small side so he has a little trouble putting the game cartridges in but other than he does really well. I would definitely buy this item again.
5,Smart-Cycle,I bought this for my son's 3rd birthday. He loves it. Easy to assemble and very fun to play.
3,No Plug - Shorted Out,"Someone bought this for my two year old and I put it together just to see if he would even get on it. He loved it, and I was impressed that he was able to reach the pedals on the lowest setting.I didn't realize it would need batteries (huge drawback - 4 D batteries are required), which baffles me because it already has one wire coming out to connect to the TV. After purchasing the batteries, I realized that the bike we got had a loose wire somewhere. I couldn't get the power to stay on for more than a couple seconds. So, I never got to test out the actual game catridge; I was curious to see if my son would even understand that he was affecting the images on our TV.Overall, it's a great concept. I was secretly happy to return it because I hated the need for batteries and didn't want to invest in rechargables (and because I knew it would be a long time before my son is actually old enough to enjoy it). I'll keep my eye out to see if Fisher-Price decides to add a plug to this."
4,smartcycle,"My 3 and 5 year old both are having a lot of fun and when they finish a game they are both panting :)I would like to have different resistance levels, the 5 yro pedal so fast she about fell off!"
4,Great Bike for Learning!,"This is a great bike for learning how to steer, pedal, words, & numbers. It would be nice if it was wireless. It's very durable. My daughter loves it! [...]."
4,Good toy--my batteries lasted!,"I read many reviews about th batteries not lasting but my son has been playing with this regularly since xmas and even has left it on a few times and the batteries are still good. The first time we set it up though it didn't work, but after a little fiddling with the batteries, it's been fine ever since. not sure why that happened. My 2.5 year old son got it for xmas and it is easy enough for him to turn on and start playing by himself. The cartridges need to be pushed hard and snapped in, but other than that he can do the games himself. He doesn't like to pedal it though and just bypasses that part of the games to play the joystick part...maybe he'll like to pedal it after he learns to better ride his tricycle this summer."
3,Not the Best for sure...,"As soon as I bought I had to take to my MECHANIC SHOP so I finally had the pedals fixed for good. It's not a bad toy but since my son got a Wii game for his 4th Birthday, he didn't care about the Smart Cycle much. He might play once in a while again, but I don't know if I would have bought it if I knew it very well."
1,Constant blue/black or garbled screen but may have found a fix,"We were able to use this game about 3 times before it started acting funny. Would get a split blue/black screen, or it would get a garbled screen, or would just shut off all together. Blowing on the contacts of the game would work for a very short time, maybe the play of one game, and then it would do it all over again. This seems to be a common problem and after doing some googling, I found a couple of possible fixes. I haven't tried any of them yet to see if they work but intend to. [...] Either of the solutions I saw, the board and switch being loose and the contacts, need cleaning, seem like that would certainly work. I just made this review so that others looking for a possible fix could find one. At this point there is no rush to fix it as my daughter has lost interest and is 3 years older"
1,Why?,Why would you pay $500 for this 1000 piece set? Amazon also sells a similar 700+ set for $45. What is the deal with this set?
2,plug wires too short,"even though this set was the correct part number for my car, 3 of the spark plug wires were 6"" too short."
4,Love this!!,"This is one of my favorite movies from the 80s. Completely hilarious, Val Kilmer is great, made well before he was ""Iceman."" Since it wasn't a huge movie I was shocked that retail stores were selling it for $22; this was a great deal."
5,Rare laserdiscs-dvds Movies Collector.,"Real Genius's one of my 80s greatest movies,'tis A Must See for Val Kilmer's Fans..you wont regret it :))))"
2,"Pardon Me, Would You Have Any Grey Poupon?","Viewed: 4/12Rate: 34/12: Real Idiot is more like it. The film is mediocre, and these kids, especially Chris Knight (very hard to see any genius in him), look like they are in a serious need of a bottle of Ritalin. Just take as many as they want, I don't really care. Jesus...check out the sideburns on Val's! Speaking of stupid, notice that the 15 year old Mitch had a hard time figuring out how the weirdo disappears in the closet. I thought the solution was so simple. Just close the freaking door! And something will open. Can't believe nobody in the project saw the true purpose of the experiment coming. That was too obvious. All in all, it's pretty difficult for me to see what's so good about Real Idiot which is a cross between WarGames and Revenge of the Nerds. More math and science please...but less of Val."
4,"Great product, mostly...","IT's awesome once you get the face plate on, but puting it on is much harder than it looks."
5,Nice addition to just about everything,"This has all the great stuff you probably use anyway (salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder and more), but conveniently in one bottle. Not to say Nature's Seasonings is a replacement for those things, but it comes comes in handy. I use Nature's Seasonings on everything I cook from veggies to meats and it is really a flavor enhancer without being too salty. I wish I found a store to buy it from in Boston so I didn't have to buy it online."
2,Try Other Games,"My 5 year old son understands the concepts of this game, but this game is not nearly as entertaining as other 6-8 year old Smartridges from Vetech like Aladdin, Spiderman or Batman. The problem with this game is in the Learing Adventure mode. My son must solve 10-12 spelling words before he moves onto another ""path"" or level. He gets frustrated because he is on the same board learning the same skill for an hour or so and then finally gets to move onto a new level. Much too long to keep his interest, so this one sits on the shelf a lot. I would stick with the other games I mentioned above to avoid frustration."
1,"okay, this WAS cool...","when i was in 6th grade. i can't believe that people can consider this band to be 'one of punk's greatest bands.' that is a complete insult to everything that punk rock really stands for. what guttermouth is is a bunch of whiny, homophobic, sexist jerks who play the most generic sounding 'punk' i have ever heard. i digress...(...) ::sigh::"
4,This is a lot to find in one book,"I first checked this book out of the library, then liked it so much that I bought it. With 24 homes in it this book was a bit overwhelming at first. It took me a week to carefully read. I agree with the reviewer who said that the floor plans were disappointing. I believe that was intentional so that people don't ""steal"" the architect's designs. The descriptions at times were too brief and frustrating in their lack of citing sources for materials. The book, though, does what it set out to do very well; promote the concept of flowing and multi-use space as the new design for modern living. Some of the ways that these families customized their homes to their lifestyle are amazing. Everyone should have a custom home because they have a custom lifestyle and preferences. Some of these families made the trade-off of a smaller house to own a custom house that they could afford. These people and their homes are inspiring."
5,Reading in the RIGHT places!,"You'll laugh out loud! The author's ""take"" on life, work, pets, dating, and more, make for a very funny book. Cicale observes the vicissitudes of life from unusual perspectives, definitely exposing the funny side of our lives.I liked the innuendo without naughty words. A series of short essays, I decided it is great gift item for friends 15 to senility, especially those with short attention spans."
5,A great product for eliminating UTI's,"Over the years I've gotten UTI after UTI. It got to the point that macrobid didn't work, and sometimes even multiple courses of the strong antibiotic Cipro were required to chase one away. I started using this product a few months back and it really does work. If I even feel like I'm getting a UTI, I can take a precautionary dose and the ""UTI feeling"" goes away. I highly recommend this product to anybody with this recurring problem as a safe natural alternative to antibiotics. Cleartract also comes in capsule form in case you may be in a social or business situation where it is inconvenient for you to mix the powder into a liquid.Cleartract is actually D-mannose, a type of sugar, but it is safe even for diabetics because D-Mannose isn't metabolized, so it doesn't interfere with blood sugar regulation. D-Mannose creates no disruption or imbalance in normal body microflora so it won't make you more prone to a yeast infection like antibiotics often do."
5,Excellant series to complete my set,"This season was a very pivotal in the telling of the story of these women. The characters all have flaws and strengths and you definitely want certain characters to work out their differences. Also, you want to hate the villain! Great series overall."
3,"Great book in print; Kindle edition, not so much","I've long thought that Hiking Grand Canyon is one of the best books about backpacking in the park. The PRINT edition is, at any rate. This review is of the Kindle version. This version preserves all of the text, but leaves out the maps that are critical to understanding the text. This is NOT apparent from the sample version of the Kindle edition, which includes the page with the map key, and includes several pictures (in grayscale, but discernible). I've brought my kindle along on some trips because it's lighter than a book, and I'd hoped that this version of the book would be worth having along. It is, but it's not what it really should be."
3,Mustache Grooming,"This looks great, but functionally the comb teeth are too short and too wide to be effective grooming aide for my full mustache. The comb does not pentrate my mustache-- which is fairly thick. It is a disappointment...such a neat item with a design challenge , at least for my beard and mustache.Service was excellent"
3,THAT'S HOW WE DEAL WITH MONSTERS,"Janine's vehicle runs off the road. The tow truck driver is a mute who then takes Janine captive. While captive we find out a few things that keep us interested in the film. Janine claims to be a thief and has a stolen photo album in her SUV which she claims is worth money. People are after it. In order to cope with captivity and the zap collar, she escapes into a dream world with her sister Alice where we discover she has daddy issues. What's in the photo album? What's with the dreams and daddy?The mystery aspect holds our interest because the slow moving film does not. The mystery involves a twist ending, which didn't make the film much better. A borderline pyschological thriller.F-bomb, nudity (Sunny La Rose, Courtney Hogan)"
3,Expected more,"I bought this game expecting to sit down and not be able to get up for at least two hours. I ended up etting up after 20 minutes. I have played many RTS games and enjoy them very much, but I just couldn't get into Earth 2150. It is very complicated and I had to go over the instruction booklet several times. I also like a good multiplayer game. THis game does include good options, but it is hard to find people to play against. I wouldnt give this game the reviews I have seen it get on internet sites. Its just your average game in my opinion."
4,This album is a freakin classic,"All the emo kids of today should be looking back here for inspiration. So much of what passes today is Weak (pun intended) but lacks subtly, honesty and rounded emotions of this album. Unfortunately fashion rules the roost and as a result, we only get what is weak."
2,Great Sound - Extremely Poor Packaging,"I bought this remastered version to replace my original copy that I have had since it came out. It's a great CD and I have played it many times over. You have to ignore the reviews that bash it because they are trying to compare the music to Led Zeppelin. Of course it sounds like Led Zeppelin. That's where the influence comes from. Is the music as good as Led Zeppelin? Of course not. But it is awesome music from a band that rocked. My big hang up with this new remastered release is the poor packaging, it is about as bland as can be. There are no album credits or liner notes anywhere. Doesn't even list the members of the band anywhere or say who produced it. Looks like I will be keeping my original copy and trading in this new unprofessionally packaged remaster."
2,WAY TOO ADVANCED!,"This video is really just WAY TOO DIFFICULT. I've been taking 2-3 yoga classes a week for over a year now,,and consider myself to be very flexible. In this tape, you can barely understand the instructor, and she does things like complete splits, headstands, etc. Very bizzarre. I regret my purchase and disposed of the tape after one time using it."
4,Surprise? Bad? Good? No no no.... Fishy yes!,"Despite the same critics who originally criticized ""Why Do They Rock So Hard?"" at its release and then loved it, saying exactly the same thing now, RBF has delivered. Rumors aside, while ""Cheer Up"" adds little new besides the covering of several different styles/eras of ""rock,"" this is essentially the same old Fish just back for more of ""Why Do They Rock So Hard?""Honestly the amount of horns in this is album is not much less if not the same as that album. I say sit back and listen to this a few times RBF fans, the songs will grow on you."
2,It was A'ight,"This album was okay, but it wasn't great. There was a lot in it that was simply boring, and this CD went pop. I really don't have a problem with pop music, but bands need to stay true to their roots, and instead of simply growing, Reel Big Fish has complete jumping the genre. Ska may not be the best seller, but they should have stayed with what they did best."
1,cheer up..more like grow up!,"I just don't understand how they could do this. After two wonderful studio albums, and a compilation of old recordings, I was nothing short of satisfied. Then, excited at a new album, I rushed out and bought ""Cheer up!"", expecting nothing short of amazing work from these guys. What I got was a new coaster for my room. Well, after I take off the last few songs on the cd, which were actually good, mostly because they didn't even write a couple of the last few. The feel of this album is fake, and the songs just don't seem like the type a band with members in their late 20's to early 30's would write. Come on guys, I know you can do better...I've heard it."
4,Give it a second listen....,"When I picked up ""Cheer Up!"" on June 25th and first popped it into my CD player I have to admit I was questioning if Reel Big Fish still had it in them after several years and many personell changes. But after listening to the songs several times through, something just clicked and it seemed alright that it felt a little pop-ish. If you listen for it, you can still hear the happy-go-lucky band from ""Turn the radio off"" But more strikingly you see a band that has fought off becoming stagnant and stale and is evolving into something new and fresh. All Im saying is give the CD a second chance before you immediately dismiss it as ""too pop"" - you'll find you see these new songs ripe with the old Reel Big Fish Charm."
3,Sell out ...,I just picked up this cd and i started listening and i started to think that this was NOTHING like old classic reel big fish. There are definate poppy rythyms and horns..... not enough horn solos and its just weak sauce for rbf. I highly reccomend picking up turn the radio off and why did they rock so hard over this album....
2,New CD with Completley new style,"If you are a loyal RBF fan, I doubt that you will enjoy this CD. It is a lot more pop than it is ska. I got it the day it came out and I was sorely disappointed. Although it is good pop music I wouldnt recommend it if you are looking to get a ska album. The catchy lyrics are gone, the RBF style isn't there anymore and there isn't excessive profanity. The album does not make we want to sign along like the other ones either. Even though the style is not their original style the music is still good, just not what I liked in RBF"
3,"It's not you, it's me","Regarding Amazon Instant VideoMy equipment: non-HDTV, Wii, DSL. When streaming is good, the picture is good but when it's not, then portion of picture is pixelated.The movie is good and would rate it 3.5-4 (out of 5) stars. Note violence and blood."
1,Be very careful!!!,"As an experienced MCT, and having taught from the MOC courseware, I can say that this book has some of the worst labs I've ever had the inopportunity to use. Especially the REGEDIT labs, where they had you looking for keys that didn't exist! (HKEY_LOCAL_COMPUTER?!? Come on!) There are a lot of end of chapter test questions that are answered in the Instructors Resource CD that are just plain wrong. Sometimes, there will be 21 answers given, but only be 20 questions in the text book! Also, the cover ripped off my copy in the first week I had it. So, use caution when using/teaching from this book. If the web site had a errata that was easy to locate, then I may be more forgiving, but it doesn't so I'm not!"
4,Wayside School Is Falling Down,"""Wayside School Is Falling Down"" By: Bruce Coville is an extreamly funny book. I recamend it to anyone between 7 and 12. If you like humor, read this book. Wayside School is not your averege school, there is dead rats that talk, strange and ugly food, and the school is THIRTY FLOORS! Also there is a sequel ""Wayside School Gets A Little Stranger"" where even wierder things happen.-Dalton"
5,My touchstone.,"I have a Celtic heritage. This is the first doll I bought for myself as an adult. She watches me work, and sometimes I just gaze at her and think about the beauty in the Celtic history."
5,A beautiful Princess,"This Irish beauty deserves to be a princess.Her coloring is wonderful,pale skin,enchanting green eyes,and lovely auburn hair.But the best thing about this doll is her clothing.Dark velvet green cape and beautifly decorated gown.I absolutely love this Princess."
1,Bright and Early Thursday Evening,"A Tangled Tale indeed...this book is so tangled I wouldn't even recommend it to an adult let alone a child. From the depressingly morbid beginnign where the woman wakes up dead, til she eats her potato husband and wakes up, the story is just terrible. It contains tons of subliminal messages that do not seem appropriate for viewers under the age of 18. As future teacher, I will not be having a copy of this book in my library or classroom."
1,Not Set Up Well,"For whatever reason, this book is not user friendly. When looking up a word, the book will refer you to ANOTHER WORD.....I don't understand the style this dictionary has. It is USELESS and lacking definitions for TONS OF WORDS.STICK TO YOUR OLD DICTIONARY. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT."
3,Better for older kids,"I have to agree with a couple of the other reviews. This game is a little challenging for young kids. I would think it is good for a typical first grader. That being said, this is my son's favorite of the games because of the characters. He always chooses this one, but becomes frustrated very easily. So, I end up playing. He loves the grocery store game (getting the supplies for the party). I HATE IT. It takes forever and the items on the list don't really look like the items on the shelves. I guess with some practice you would be able to get around the store maze quickly and get the items, but it takes me a while...and then paying for them...again counting out every coin for an endless stream of items. It does hold my son's attention span while I play, but as an adult, I think some of the other games (like Scooby Doo) are more entertaining."
3,"Don't know, We can't play it","The system won't work, but it seemed cute when it did work (for about a week)"
4,Ending Revealed Early,"Another Great Story from Havill. However, the title and the plot reveals the ending and the bad guy early."
1,This price for a piece of machined aluminum?,"OK, it works and works well, other than the sloppy stops the Omnijig employees.But this price for a piece of machined aluminum? What does it cost Porter Cable to make this accessory? $2?PC does have to cover the development costs and should charge a premium for a jig that is somewhat of a standard in woodworking. Check out the price of the Omnijig. Trust me, you've already paid for this accomplishment when you purchased the original jig. And the design of this jig hasn't changed in years and years. PC is way behind the times.I'm thinking (hoping) that there is a special place in hell for those individuals in companies, like Porter Cable, who decide to rape their customers, who have already paid a hefty tab for the jig, when they want to purchase an accessory for that jig.Shame on Porter Cable. If had it to do over again, I wouldn't buy a PC dovetail jig."
3,Red Eye Reduction doesn't work well,I like this camera a lot except for the red eye reduction feature. Just about every picture I get back has some red eye glare. This is disappointing since the camera otherwise takes very good photos.
3,Inconsistent Pictures,"I bought this camera to replace my fabulous Elph stolen during a trip to Mexico. I am very pleased with the size and features of the camera but unfortunately the camera takes very inconsistent pictures. Some pictures come back beautiful and other times I'm left with rolls of disappointing shots. I've taken the camera to Europe twice, once with great results and most recently, 3 rolls were terrible. The size isn't worth sacrificing picture quality so I may stick with my large/bulkier Minolta 35mm which takes beautiful pictures. In reading previous consumer reviews, it sounds like there may be a corrolation between picture quality and processing. I may bring one of the bad rolls into another processing center and see if the pictures come back better."
5,A terrific camera for precise situations,"Whilst not quite a point and shoot product this camera is intuitive to use and delivers an almost infinite variety of choice by varying format and focus.Somewhat larger and heavier than the basic ELPH LT, it is nonetheless small, rugged and totally reliable indoor or out at any time of day or night from southern Africa to Canada.My first time using the camera I was somewhat intigued by the way the flash and motorised zoom lens popped in and out, but I was soon accustomed to this.Pictures have been uniformly excellent, allowing for operator error.If you wish for a camera which will give you the reward for a little care in composing a shot, then buy this one with total confidence."
1,"Totally Overhyped, Zero Information on the Core Topic","David Nolte may be an optics expert, but he certainly is neither a computer expert, an algorithm expert, a software development expoert nor a vision expert or AI expert. The quality of the latter topics is about 0.1%, 0%, 0%, 5%, 0.1% respectively of introductory texts for these fields.This book gives zero information on the key topic of how his optical computers (or any other) are going to handle the topics AIs, Intelligence and Vision. (Of course this is due to the fact that nobody knows how to do it today, but at least they do not claim so)."
4,just get it,"i somehow discovered Eugenius in undergrad, probably by way of Teenage Fanclub. later i heard Cobain cover the Vaselines, so i got the Way. i was a little overwhelmed by the raw simplicity of it, but i loved it. and i discovered this was also Eugene Kelly stuff. i was very pleased with myself for having made this connection. still later, i discovered the Captain America record."
4,I wish i could give a 4.5,"after having listened to this release it is easy to hear the many popular bands that the vaselines have influenced. A few of these songs are kinda dull, but that's okay because some of these songs are essental listening to any rock or pop music fan. The vaselines are no Pixies, but this cd is a great listen, that is an indisspensable album to the intelligent and open-minded rock fan."
3,only made famous because of Kurt Cobain,"This gets publicity simply b/c of the Nirvana connection.This is very eccentric, shoegazing, D.I.Y. music. It is so earthy and different that it does have a certain charm to it.The best songs are ""Jesus wants me for a Sunbeam"" ""Son of a Gun"" and ""You think your a man"". This is not on par with any mainstream, professional production work.The work is precious yet you can only take so much. I wonder what their exposure would have been without the Nirvana unplugged connection."
4,good for beginners,"This book was quite informational for beginners, it explained how to paint without getting too involved."
3,"Looked kinda dingy, like it wasnt new...","I think I bought this product new but it didnt look new. It looked kind of dirty... Also, it wasn't the pretty light blue it is online. It was like light blue-green and not a very nice color. Product works fine though."
1,Not so hot,"Good flame performance, and easy to use and refill, however the igniter failed after the first session. I contacted Bernzomattic's customer support and they said to return to the store for refund/replacement."
2,The Lion King is too short of a game,"My son is three years old and at first he was very interested on the game for about a week, and now he feels bored playing it. I'm planning on buying Spiderman I just hope is not a short game. Otherwise the entire concept is great."
2,Pass on this one,"Just not happening on this one for my kids. At the current price of $22, I'd say to pass on this. That's way to expensive for a game like this."
2,"good, but there is better!","This was one of the first books that I ever bought.It's a pretty good book but it's pretty much all about revenge and self-gain.Now as the Wiccan Rede states, we are bound not to hurt people and ever mind the Rede of three. So I guess it's all up to you if you want to try some spell. But I wouldn't really recomend it. ""Blessed Be"""
2,"to turn atud,revenge,wealth,love...","I have read the book it seem,s very interesting, but with a lot of empty gaps in between.like where to get materials needed in the are you (person)lives. How long will the effect of any spell perform last and none information what so ever on how to reverse or break any of this.I don,t know anything about this world. But I,m a very concious person and believe in not hurting any person unless I have to defend my self in a no way out situation.I read the other,s review and I guess what it really made think I need to find out more information before I decide to play with this book ,was something about the rule of three (where it states that anything you do it will be done back to you with 3x the strengh or something like that) I would love to get any recommendation,s and answer,s or sugestion,s to all my question,s Thank you very much. E-mail portisa@ic.si.edu"
1,"I have not read this book, but it is a Fake.","0 Stars:A book to turn your ex-boyfriend into a toad? Even if it is to get even. A spell for revenge? I don't think so. REAL Witches (and when I say REAL I mean REAL) would never do such a thing. There is a line in the Witches Rede that states: ""And it harm none, do as thou wilt."" This basically means HURT NO ONE. I think books like these are the reason why people have been misinformed about the Craft. I find it a shame that books like these are published period. And to all of u out there that think witchcraft is all about spells, you're wrong it is so much more than that, and I feel that books like these aren't worth the money for the paper they were written on. I am sorry if I come across you as being mean, but I feel books like these aren't worth the trees that had to die for it. And plus a witch believes in the three-fold law (what u do comes back to u 3 times) so think about it before u use a spell for revenge or bane.)O( A Disappointed Witch )O("
5,"Just as ordered, timely delivery.","Great product, gave multiple copies as Easter gifts. Friend says this book is life changing! Can't wait to read....."
3,Wore Me Out,"As the author ofAmaze Yourself : Take a Quantum Leap, and both author and big-time lover of personal development books, this one frankly wore me out. The writing and language are way too old fashioned, at best! And as to the contents, I frankly prefer the more passionate and timely writing of Louise Hayes."
5,Do you have 90 minutes???,"This book is a concise and easy to read map for making your life the very best! Based on scriptures and an understanding of the mind, subconscious, conscious and super-conscious, Florence Shinn makes it easy to see why your life is what it is, and how to change it for the better."
3,duplication,"The book has some of the same good advice that I have read in others..however, the second part of the book was not an interpretation but the exact book rewritten with ""her"" instead of him."
5,The Greatest $6.00 Investment you will ever Make!,"This book is so powerful, yet so simple to understand and read. The chapters are short; so I read a chapter a day to keep me motivated, thinking positively and expecting great things to happen to me. It is thin enough to keep in my purse, so I can pull it out if I have a few minutes while waiting for something/one. It really has changed my life. I keep copies (Amazon makes this so easy) to give to people as gifts and the feedback from them has always been positive; they start passing it on.FYI to publisher - I prefer the original cover and layout of the book over the existing one."
5,Best Civil War Series ever!,"This series is so vastly superior to Ken Burns' overlong, uneven treatment, it doesn't deserve comparison. The Divided Union is just as comprehensive, and half as long. More intelligent and insightful historians provide the commentary (I found Eric Foner's comments especially enlightening and revealing...this series was my introduction to this brilliant man), graphics at least as good, battle recreations taken from actual battle recreations, choice and rather playing the same uninspired theme endlessly, it utilizes a wide variety of music VERY well selected, period music performed on authentic instruments with a high level of attention to correct style.I wish THIS series were available on DVD. It was first broadcast on PBS a decade or so before the Burns series, but thanks to his strangle hold on PBS, I doubt if it will ever be shown again."
2,More Dead Than Alive,The story is very good. Clint Walker and the supporting cast are good also.The problem here is the music score does not in any way go along with this movie.I also believe that the director did not get the most out of this fantastic cast.This could have been a whole lot better.
2,Nothing against the seller...,"I only rated this movie like this, because the way the movie ended. I gave this movie away. Did not like it. Seller got the movie to me very fast. A++++"
3,Disappointed,"I purchased this product because my tub chair was to large for my daughters tub. I thought this was a super idea. It would not secure even though the tub measurement were within stated guidelines. The bench is great quality and light weight to travel, but just would not secure to our tub."
3,Didn't fit.,This bench did not fit our tub which is 26.5 inches wide edge to edge with an opening 21.5 inches wide.
3,Could be Better,There are a lot of features that are lacking on the 4112. For one thing there sould be some extensions that allow you to clamp the machine as well as screw it to the side of a table. I also agree with other users that there should be an eaiser way to adjust the depth of cut. The tool works but if I had the option again I would buy a used Leigh jig.
4,P-C 12in dovetail system 4112P,"This product lives up to the claims made by the manufacturer. The unit is well made with bends and fittings all being where they should be for fast assembly and precise adjustments. The auto-indexing is fast and accurate. However in this regard some flexibility would be a nice feature if one needs to prepare boards that are not in increments of 1/2in or 1/4in for the templates available. Also the top alignment bar could be a little longer for ease in attaining perfect squareness. Speaking of templates, I own the set. The CMC aluminum construction was a big selling point of me.The only glitch I have found is a propensity for the top board to slip (ruins the joint) when applying 'significant' pressure when joining,for example, ash. A little sand paper may fix this but replacing the holddowms with hollow square steel stock (0.75in) certainly will the trick."
3,The River Between Us,"The River Between Us, by Peck, illustrates the beginning of the civil war in 1861. Tilly Pruitt and her family welcome two stranges from New Orleans to stay with them in their house in Illinois. Their whole household changes when the strangers introduce new styles and home remedies. The overprotective mother worries about her son, Noah, going into the war. He eventually leaves home and his mother sends Tilly to retrieve him from the war camp.I recommend this book for children ages 11-15 so that they understand the events occuring in the book."
4,What a great book!!!,"I love this historicle fiction book, it used GREAT discription and had a great plot that kept me interested the intire time! Although some parts were very sad, and the time change was rather confusing I loved it. The book tells a story of a boy in the civel war. He has just turned 16 and is allowed to join the army. He is eager to fight for the North. Then a misterious girl appears off a boat and is welcomed into the Pruitt family. The girl appears to be keeping Noah from leaving and the mother is thankful for that. What will hapen? I LOVE this book!!!"
1,"The WHAT Disco Band? Surely, NOT Super!","I just couldn't get into this band's disco music. Don't get me wrong. I DJ a wide variety of music for different parties and events and I know the past hits, as well as current hits of today. It really had a ""Countdown Singers"" feel to this one - and trust me it isn't a good feeling - and there seems to have been a reason why no one remembers this ""Super Disco Band"" in the first place. After listening to this group of 30-second samples, I was not feeling it at all. I personally would not recommend this one, for any one. Unless, of course, you mean it as a practical joke to drive someone crazy by having it play over and over and get irritating like fingernails on a chalk board. Stick with the well-known artists in the past if you really want a good disco album, like Chic, Bee Gees, etc."
5,"Smoothest I""ve Tried - in My Lifetime","I went to World Markets and finally did it - I bought a box of PG Tips. This tea is mysteriously free of bitterness - so smooth. I found that I need to put less half-n-half in my cup when I drink this, because it's that smooth. It's even enjoyable to open the box because the fragrance is uniquely lovely! I strongly recommend that you at least give this tea a try. I will never go back to Tetley British Blend, again - inferior!!"
5,This is a fantastic camera,"I had bought a fantastic camera called Canon Rebel 2000 Date Body in Brazil. For me, a amadorist photographer is perfect camera SLR. I need this camera to take pictures from climbs, camps, and so. And my sister take pictures from your architectural projects. And I bought a 20/80 lenses, to improve my camera."
4,Tara King provided a spark we all knew would flame,"Let's be honest. It was a little frustrating watching the playful antics of Steed and Mrs Peel, knowing that all that would ever happen would be a respectful peck on the cheek or a cordial hug. Enter Tara King, Steed's last partner. She is a Peel-in-training, only a little younger and a lot more in love with John Steed. Of course we know that nothing overt would ever happen between the two. It's just nice to know that when the credits roll the two might actually kiss on the lips. Linda Thorson is absolutely terrific as Steed's sidekick. She is athletic, fearless and determined. The '68 episodes were constructed with the same care and attention as the Rigg episodes and they are a pleasure to watch. If you think Mrs Peel was the only game in town, check out Tara King. She is a gas."
4,Bought it only for the Lindy dance segment,I love the Lindy and Frankie Manning's dancing. That's the only reason I bought it. It was good for a slapstick movie but the dancing was too short and not enough.
4,Really Pretty,I find this doll prettier in real life than in photo. It is also exotic and very original. And the dress is beautiful too. Its one of the best of the 'Dolls of the Worl Collection'.
2,"Great looking, poor build quality",Purchased the night stand version of this table and i love how it looks but it is seriously lacking in the build quality compartment. The drawer barely went together as most of the predrilled holes are in the slightly wrong location. Also the drawer requires a substantial amount of screwing around with to get it to open and close smoothly and as it comes from the factory it just falls off the wooden rails. The top of the table does not sit flat on the 4 posts so it wobbles around quite a bit.
3,"Nice, but not without faults","The product is nice and corresponds to the picture on amazon. However, one massive fault was a piece where holes were punched on the wrong side and so I had to punch them again, so the screws would fit. Luckily, you could not see this on the outside, but it gave me a significant additional work and obviously required more tools than anticipated. The stand looks nice and combined with some other pieces from the product line, it's a good buy. Not sure if I would recommend it. Perhaps if you're buying several pieces together and you know where you want them in your home. Otherwise, buying furniture online is always a bit of a gamble."
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT!,A nutritionist/sports trainer suggested I start taking greens rather than vitamins which aren't easily assimulated in our bodies.Macro Greens Power is an excellent value and tastes pretty good to boot!
5,Easy and fun to use.,"I have owned two Canon digital cameras, the latest a 7d with a set of different lenses. I grew up with film cameras and still use many different kinds as a hobby. The Canon 2000 is a very flexible camera and close to the point and shoot variety of digital cameras. I like the look and feel of film as well as digital photos, just as I still like to listen to my old LP's as well as my mp3 player. This camera winds and counts all the frame first then winds back into the can after each frame. It uses the markings on the can to know the film speed and count. Since it is auto focus and exposure, the photos come out nearly perfect. But there are a range of manual and semi manual settings for both focus and exposure for your creativity."
