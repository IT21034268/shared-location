4,Typo's,I enjoyed the story line and the prophecy's. The only problem with this Kindle book was the typo's. I would recommend this book!
5,Number 2 is soooo much better,"I know I said in my review of the first in the series, that I would not buy the second. I was pleasantly surprised. I picked it up when I noticed that is was co-authored by a different author. This book was so much better than the first. I loved all the details and the way the story captivated you and made you want to hike to Ararat!!! I hope the next installment is as thought provoking and exciting as this one was. You won't be disappointed. Entertainment and Education all in one---Bravo!!!"
3,Just can't get into it,"Left Behind books - Great; Babylon Rising: The Secret on Ararat - Not so good. I had a real problem reading this book. The first one I liked, maybe too much of an Indiana Jones twist, but maybe that's why I liked it. The Left Behind series I would read until they were finished, non-stop. This one has laid on my nightstand for 3 months. There's not as much mystery and suspense as the first. Not much mentioning at all about the ""arch enemies"" of Murphy. It's very lonely and empty and the search for the actual ark doesn't begin until the last quarter of the book. I honestly can't remember what happened in the first part of the book because I just can't pay attention to it. I have forgotten most of the characters for lack attention or they are just not built up enough in description to remember. Sorry, but it just doesn't flow the way I'm used to seeing a book with Tim Lahayes' name on it."
4,Good but not excellent,"I had searched for 5 years for this item. to match 3 that I had purchased elsewhere. Through a web search, I was able to find them, All in all, they were as good as the old ones, but a little sloppily bent. In other words, they did not all match. the part of the square rod that is supposed to be straight, in two of them was curved. again, a little sloppy. I was able to put them in a vise and pound them straight. But this cracked the paint. Again, not a big deal as they are going to be outside on the side of my barn, and out in the weaTHER ANYWAY. THE OLD ONES HAVE A RUSTY PATINA AND ARE NOW AGED WITH RUSTIC CHARM. THANKS , PHIL PARENT"
2,"This is not Watermelon, Chicken, and Gritz","Nappy USED to have hits. Now they're a bunch a cheap sellouts. Some of WL's tracks have some nice beats, but most are rushed and poorly produced. Download the few singles on this cd, but don't buy it. 2 stars."
4,No jinx here...,"Excellent follow up. Not every song works for me but the large majority do.With all deference to the Amazon reviewer above, 2 of my favorite songs are Push On and Leave This Morning - I guess that's what makes the world go around...I certainly wouldn't call them ""missteps"".Check it out"
3,Nappy Roots Wooden Leather Album,"cd wasn't as good as their last one, watermelon, chicken gritz. Had a few good songs like No Good and Twang."
5,The best classic jazz,"I decided to add some old, classic jazz to my collection, and the Prestige series and the Blue Note collections are the best you can get.If you like the classics, you can't do better than this!!"
4,GOOD FILM,"It's a good film. I lost interest though because it's a lot like many other boxing films. The great thing about this story is the Mexicans get to get the money and return home to live better on their land. I only ordered this film because I'm a big fan of Steven Bauer. He does a great job in this, so do the other actors. I feel the writing could've been deeper."
2,Blaxploitation II,This film does deserve credit for the outstanding performances done but it's cast most of whom are newcomers. The film sadly in many ways is a modern day latino incantation of the Blaxploitation genre of film of the 1970's. Noble and heroic latino/hispanic people unite and trimumph over the evil anglo/white people. The film is loaded with false stereotypes many young and often uneducated urban latinos have of anglo whites. Given the current climate in the country over immigration I would not show this film to young people if I were a parent of any race or ethnicity.
1,"All Tell, No Show","I picked this up the other day, not expecting too much, but hoping that, considering the fame of the author, it would be a decent read.Woe upon me! This book is hardly printworthy. I would give it 0 stars, if I could.While the premise of the story is quite interesting, it is exceedingly poorly written. Perhaps this book was meant as an outline for a longer, fleshed out work, and someone accidentally forwarded to the printers. The prose is sloppy and nondescript, the characters are paper-thin, and the dialogue - though there is plenty of opportunity for it - is sparse and uninspiring, and what was no doubt meant as a surprise at the end was neither surprising nor particularly original. As the title of this review indicates, in this book, Farmer is all tell and no show.Not recommended except as an example of how NOT to write fiction for writing teachers to give their students."
5,Another Two Year Old Enamoured with Bad Cat,"Chalk up one more rave review by an almost-two toddler. My daughter actually had the Bad Cat sequel first (Bad Cat Puts On His Top Hat). We got Bad Cat when I just could not read Bad Cat II one more time! :) Truthfully, I love them both and so does she. The ""busy"" pictures--the ones with all of the characters (especially the opening page of the book)--are, by far, her favorites, as she loves to pick out the characters from the busy city scenes. She also is completely cracked up by the character's names (in both books). (Today, she kissed one of the pages in the book and said, ""I love you, Pooslop."") Bad Cat is one misunderstood cat; he's naughty, and silly, and great fun to read."
3,Lisa Jankovic,"Having read the novel, I decided it was time to see the film. However I must admit that I was never a fan of Charisma Carpenter, but I really enjoyed her in this film.See Jane Date is about finding the one....but having to date all the losers to get to Mr Right.Jane's cousin is getting married to a high flying internet exec, and having a fancy expensive wedding. Jane feels she can't turn up alone, so starts going on a series of dates to find her ""date"" for the wedding.The book maybe more detailed, but the film is pretty much right on. However I am suprised that they cast Holly Marie Combs in the role of Natasha Nutley....but she's very good in the role and has a very nice wardrobe.I would recommend this film for anyone who has needs a laugh or has gone through the hell of dating..haha"
1,"Nice to push, rough to ride in","The suspension and brake make this seem nice for parents, but look closely at the seat. There is no padding on the seat, seatback, or shoulder straps. After buying this, and opening the box, I had no intentions of making our precious child ride in that.I looked around, found the Instep Safari for $10-20 more that has great padded seat, seatback, and shoulder straps, as well as child tray, swivel/fixed wheel options, and looks a lot nicer overall."
4,great buy,"I wanted to have a stroller for walking and running, this has been great. My daughter likes it too. She enjoys being able to look at where we are going instead of the baby carrier kind where she stares at me the whole time. This also allows me to have a longer workout time since she is happy. I the only think is that the brake doesn't catch so much, but it has a safety wrist leash, so it is still safe. Hope this helps."
1,Way toooo small,"This is a great idea however is not a great product. The stamp pad for this is a normal size. The stamp itself is miniature. It is so small that you could not put the finger number in a circle on the fret to indicate how to play the chord. thankfully it was cheap, don't waste your money buying this thing, it is a 1/4 of the size that it should be. the image makes it look big, trust me, it is not."
3,GREAT~!!!!! But........,"WOW, this really works~!!! LOL~!!!! Cute little toy like Robot ""walks"" around a room and sweeps for me. My dog loves it too. It is a cheap looking plastic gadget made in China, but it indeed does a job for you. Down side is Replacing PADs, and that is where they make bucks~!!! Pads can be washed/dried and used it again few more times. I am supposed to get 48 FREE replacement pads, however, the web site, nor the 1800 number does not seems to exist. What's up with that?? DO NOT work on Carpet. ONLY for hard floor."
1,Disappointing,"I bought the RoboMaid because I had seen a good review for it elsewhere, and figured that a low-tech toy might amuse my husband. We weren't too impressed. The replacement pads get filled quite easily, and anything remotely solid that the RoboMaid comes across only gets pushed around (and sometimes is re-deposited under sofas, chairs, cabinets or in the corner).It's a cute little gadget but my husband went and bought a more high-tech robotic vacuum a few days later."
2,A good story...,The ghost writers are no match to VC Andrews' original writing style. The Orphans series was ok but a bit predictable. I couldn't get into this one. This book is interesting but could be better.
4,Nice Memories,"I had seen some movies starring James Stewart growing up. I hadn't seen several in this set , so I bought it. He was very enjoyable to watch in all these different roles. I found the set to be a nice blend , romance , hardship,drama, personal struggle. I still really enjoy most westerns, and the settings and plots. The blend of Stewart and Fonda ,sometimes as friends or rivals was very well portraid . I also like when the dvd includes any behind the production interviews from actors,writers, producers, directors."
4,Fast when not using backup program.,"This drive works very well when using for dragging and dropping folders and files, but very slow when using backup program. I had over 2 hours and less than 50% done for 7 gig when I stopped backup. The ""y"" USB was plugged into two ports. It makes better sense just to use it as a extra drive and back up only folders, data files, pictures, etc by dragging them to the drive icon. XP detects drive without installing any extra software and copies large files very fast."
1,Think twice before buying this drive!,"I had the One Touch II Mini for a little over one year, then the USB port actually came loose and fell into the drive itself (just after the product came out of warranty of course, so no replacement) rendering it useless. Maxtor/Seagate ""offered"" to recover the data... for MINIMUM of $700!!POS drive as far as I'm concerned, with horrible tech support to boot. Now I'm stuck with a paperweight that contains all my backup info. Stay away from this product if you're looking for a reliable drive. I'll never buy from them again."
5,The Cross and its Shadow,thank you for the book I enjoy buying books from the states because and not very expensive and I will buy from you again you very much
5,Unique vampire romance,"A great first book in what appears to be a series. I bought this book on a whim after reading the reviews,and decided to buy it. I'm glad I did. I absolutely loved this book. It has a different take on the vampire. Lanie was a great female lead character and Mac was a solid male character. I liked the way she drew out the romance, it played into the story, it didn't become the story. I like plot, action, interesting characters and a little sex never hurts. This book had a great combination of all these necessary components for making a very interesting and enjoyable read."
1,Not compatible! Sandisk unreliable,"Recently bought a DSC-H2 Sony camera. Although it was apparently compatible, it actually isn't. Sandisk people blame the camera and provide awful customer support. Furthermore, you only know it ain't compatible since when inserting it, the camera asks to insert the stick again. Buy the Sony stick and it'll work fine. Worth the extra bucks.Watchout with Sandisk!"
1,Lasted 1 day,"Worked great for about 3 hours, then it locked up and became completely useless. Granted, they're cheap to buy, but I would have hoped it would last long enough to actually use."
1,Scan Disk Media - Dont Trust It,"This media has had major problems, causing me to spend the money for Sony authentic media and discard this crap. It failed to safely store the pictures. Several media readers I have tried wont read what is written on it properly. The Sony camera I used it in fails to recognize everything on it, and we know its highly unlikely that the camera is defective over a generic piece of media. Ill never trust Scan Disk with my photos again!!!"
3,DONT get it for your PSP.,"Sandisk not a bad brand, however this model of memory stick PRO DUO just not competible with the Sony PSP. I tried copy files and mp3 into my PSP on the day i received it. and it just dead after 100+MB, I couldnt even format it or got it recognized by my psp or PC. I returned it and got a replacement from Amazon ( Great Customer Service ). Same problem with the replacement too. I believe not just me have this problem with this memory stick PRO DUO. Go and get the Gaming version if you need that for your PSP. it work great with the Gaming model. Dont try give yourself a try just because of the price ( it dropping because of that ), I sure you will ended up paying more maney or shipping to order the model for PSP Gaming one."
5,Great for psp,"Do not regret buying this memorystick. Got it for my psp, and has not had a single error with it. Its got a fast transfer speed, and the size is perfect for a film and some music albums. And its a memory pro converter in the pagage it can also be used in my cybershoot, and then viewing the pictures on the psp, GREAT."
1,SanDisk Pro Duo Media is not compatible with my SanDisk 6in1 reader,"The card reader will not recognize the media. I updated the firmware. Still no luck. Thought I had a defective product (SanDisk Pro Duo), so I exchanged it for a new one. Still no recognition. I can upload data from it if I put it in the camera and use the Sync Cord, but this is a pain.The problem has something to do with the existing formatting of the card, however I was unable to reformat the card. It seems to be inaccessible. If you know how to get around this, by all means, buy it (and let me know too). If not a guru, buy Sony."
5,"Wonderful, recommend to everyone","It's the perfect stick. It's the same as the special ""Yellow"" one, but it's cheaper, and comes with an adapter. You have to use the adapter with most memory card readers, since they don't usually read the memory stick duo sized chips. But I've put it into 3 seperate readers, and they all worked. I have not tried this chip in my digital camera which takes Memory Stick Pro media (the larger one) but Sony says it should work.A previous reviewers said it was incompatible, but Sony says it will work in any device which supports Memory Stick Pro or Memory Stick Pro Duo. It is incompatible with Memory Stick devices (without the Pro or Duo in their names)."
2,Spoiled brat kid out to make a buck,"If you have read either his own words, or that of Charles Chaplin Jr, then this book will give no further information on the great comedian and film maker. But then, Charlie Chaplin, while a major figure in history, is not the focus of the book, but rather, the motivating force of a narcissistic boy trying to start his adult actor career in the motion picture business during the mid-60's. While it was written with the ""modern' jargon of the hippie era, it is nothing more than a self-delusional journey into Michael's own feeling of self-importance. The only reason I've kept my copy is because it only rounds out the other Charlie Chaplin biographies I have. It is no wonder this book has not been reprinted and that Michael has disappeared from the public eye.I wouldn't recommend throwing away more than a dollar on this book (I spent a quarter for my copy)"
2,A real leaker,"No matter how careful you are with pouring the water in, some is going to leak out.Also the stop drip feature when you pull the pot out while it is still brewing doesn't always work, causing a wonderful mess."
2,Leaking Water,The coffee maker worked great for about a year and then one morning I poured the water in and it just passed right on through Mr. Coffee. He can't hold his water anymore. Disappointing since other Mr. Coffee products have lasted forever.
1,Worked ok for about a week.,Heater (and brewing) then shuts off part way through brewing - takes a /long/ time to complete brewing now.
1,Great til death do us part!,"This was a perfectly fine coffee maker. It produced a good cup of coffee, was easy to clean and had convenient features. In less than a year, however, it suddenly decided not to brew. Troubleshooting didn't solve the problem. I am sick and tired of buying substandard junk from you-know-where and would love to purchase a USA made coffee maker with a decent warranty. Since it crapped out on the 4th of July, it's fitting that I'm declaring my independence from companies that have outsourced American jobs to produce junk elsewhere, then try and sell it back to unemployed American consumers...not exactly a sustainable business model.Mr. Coffee FTX49 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Black/Red"
2,"Good coffee, good system but breaks easily","It has been a good coffeemaker to us until last week. It only last for 6 months. It doesn't brew anymore. The electronics still works, relay seem to click and turn on but it does not heat up. I've been looking for spare parts but not the heating element.Nice design, good electronics, red elegant looking, shiny, classy. Before it broke, I would have given it 5 stars but not anymore. My previous coffee maker lasted more than 5 years until the glass was dropped and broke."
1,Junk,I received this coffee pot for Christmas and it never really got the coffee that hot then today - it died. 3/19/2011 3 months later. Would love to know how to get a hold of the company for a replacement!
2,Mr. Coffee Ignores Design Flaws,"This Coffeemaker was sent to me as a replacement after the first Mr. Coffee maker with steel closed-style carafe leaked coffee all over my brand new wood floor during its first week. I insisted on this version because i assumed I wouldn't have problems with a more simple carafe. Not true! As others state, this carafe leaks water and coffee from the simple act of pouring. Pour as slow as you want and it will still dribble down because of the way they designed the plastic ring at the top. Also, this plastic ring has a channel between it and the glass that you can't get to in order to clean, but water/coffee/soap can get in there and never fully dry. This means whatever bacteria that builds up in there can end up in your cup. I can't believe this is still on the market. There is no way they don't know about this problem, but continue to send them off. Have a little integrity Mr. Coffee and fix the problem!"
1,Bad check valve in Mr Coffee FTX45-1. Stops making coffee.,I have the answer why the FTX45-1 stops brewing before it is done! The check valve in the hose is bad. It's the lump at the end of the hose that connects to the water tank. It does not let the water flow properly into the heating element and the water steams furiously and the thermostat shuts off the coffee maker. And yes I cleaned it over and over! Mr. Coffee needs to do a RECALL to repair them all!!! Better yet an exchange program where Mr Coffee is sold! I emailed them and told them. I would be happy just to get a new improved check valve. The coffee maker has those goofy screws on the bottom to keep us out. I used a small screw driver and got them unscrewed. [...]
4,MORE!!!!!,This book was great. It feels good when you can read a book over and over again and never get tired of it. It wasn't too long (like some x-rated movies) and it wasn't too short. Yonder thank you for giving me more ideas to fantasize about. Great book!
5,Ann Moten-Arthur (This is toooooo..... HOT for TV),"This is a very good book and it takes you back in the day, ooh yes it does and that 1069 scene.... wow,wow,wow I can't even explain it, you need to read the book to find out....Anyhow Yonder bring it on, I'm ready for the next book, so I can put my feet up on a warn afternoon and FANTASIZE."
5,Want to do Taboo?,"Yonder One has penned a hot and steamy read. Lots of great sex, with humor laced throughout. Definitely a good read for those fellas who desire to know about the little toys their women play with in the dark.Jessica Tilles, author of Sweet Revenge"
5,One of the best exercise books I've ever read!,"This is a wonderful book! These are exercises anyone can do and are so much fun! Also, the illustrations are so cute! I highly recommend this book!"
2,compartment sorter,"For the price of this item, I was disappointed to find that the shelves were made out of cardboard. Not what I was expecting for the price."
3,Cheap Quality,"The size is good, but the construction is, quite frankly, flimsy. The interior slats are made of cardboard, not wood. There's any number of ways this could be made using sturdier press-board for the interior slots, but Fellows went the cheap-route here.Also, you would be well advised to purchase some woodworking glue to put this together. The kit includes a tiny vial of glue which, if you're frugal with it, might just barely get you through the installation. Get a small bottle of woodworking glue and save yourself the frustration of running out, halfway through the job.Other than that, this works. It looks ok. It's fairly costly for what you're getting."
2,Comes UNASSEMBLED! Did not expect this!,"I ordered this sorter and it arrived in a little flat box. What the website does not tell you is that it comes completely unassembled and they send you about a dozen wooden pegs and a little tube of glue and a bunch of teeny tiny nails to hammer on the VERY flimsy cardboard backing. I decided to ship it back. It wasn't worth my time and effort to go through this for such a piece of junk. I WILL say that the lady I spoke with at Amazon was VERY sweet and kind and treated me very nicely through the whole phone call, but Amazon needs to let folks know that this item needs a ton of assembly!"
1,Very poor quality. Don't buy it!,"The shelf broke before we even had it assembled. The shelves are made of cardboard, not wood or even laminate. Very disapppointed. Don't buy this one!"
5,Dis-solve that bad stuff with the power of sulphur,"Powerful product, should be well informed before purchasing, not to be underestimated .Provides a beautiful shine to the skin, dis-solves bad calcium, creates amazing flexibility, and cleanses the liver.I know this product works because I use it not because some one else told me this or that :)Best of Luck!"
5,"Oh my god, I know them!!!!","I just received this book for the holidays. I was going to bar/bat mitvahs in the early eighties and throughly enjoyed this book. Then came the photo. I graduated junior high with the entire table!!!There are no words to describe how happy I am with this book, except to say that reading it was pure enjoyment."
5,Scary but true,"This is a must see for everyone,it is abit inteimdating to know the truth but we must all open our eyes. The seller was very professional and sent the product straight out."
4,its pretty good,"basically the story's about this super villain called Traitor and the different generations of green lanterns that fought him. i thought that overall the comic was good, but i must admit that hal jordan's part was really cheap. abin sur's story was interesting because it's set in the wild west. the real reason for buying the comic though is kyle's part, because kyle has all the action and creativity."
4,High Viz - It sure is,"I'm really a bit 50/50 on this one. On one had it really does dramatically increase your awareness of the sight while really helping you to maintain your eyes free so you can look for the target. No question about it, that this sight is loads better then the standard sight that came on my Benelli. But on the down side, the screw that comes with the sight never really stays in tight in the rib. You have to use lock-tight on the screw, but i would also recommend using lock-tight everywhere the sight makes contact with the rib, to prevent it from pivoting left/right around the screw. Maybe if the design incorporated some kind of clip at the bottom that would keep it from moving around, I would give it a higher rating..."
5,Well Written,"I am very impressed by this book. It really inspired me to continue with my art and to inspire others to become artists. I really loved the story of Harriet Tubman which not only utilizes some of the ideas presented but would be very useful for teachers to use in their lessons on Harriet Tubman to students. This book can help anyone find there artistic, creative side."
2,The Forest,"THE FOREST is a stupid and confused Slasher-turned-ghost-story about two couples who are stalked through the woods by a cannibalistic killer. The awful score is the best THE FOREST has to offer over its uneventful storytelling, bloodless murders, and idiotic characters. It is simply a bore to watch, and the supernatural elements plot elements make absolutely no sense. The ghosts of the killer's family come and go at various points, interacting with the characters who seem entirely unfazed by their existence. Thankfully, a few of the poorly scripted lines make for some unintentional humor and milk entertainment, but other than that, this is a bottom of the barrel Horror with no redeeming qualities. It is clearly the work of a talentless director looking to exploit the ""Slasher in the woods"" theme.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
2,Stay Away from The Forest,"Im only giving this 2 stars cause i was able to get thru it, this is definitly not something that any slasher fan would wanna watch twice, like Dont go in the woods or Just before dawn, the forest is the worst woods slasher of the bunch, no real gore , no good death scenes, and a ridiculous plot about a man who kills his cheating wife and takes his children to go live in a cave in the woods, eventually the kids kill themselves and the lonely man kills campers for food we see no real canniblism except what appears to be a pot roast on a spick thats supposed to be human, the campers are guided to safety by the ghosts of the mans children its pretty lame, slasher fans pass whoever said this was classic is just hype dont believe the hype this movie is bad in a bad way."
5,Just simply one of the best!!!,I grew up listening to hard core punk. And one of the bands that I remember playing at CBGB'S was the Beastie Boys with one of the girls from Luscious Jackson backing them on drums. They kicked ass then and they still kick ass today!!! One of the reasons why I listen to the Beastie's is because they bridge that gap between rock and rap. And they are one of the ones next to Rage Against the Machine Etc... who do it the best!!!
1,this cd sucks,for fanatical star struck beastie fans only. this cd really sucks. on check your head the beastie boys main assette LYRICS went belly up. on this cd the beasties prove that they suck musically as well. i would fully recommend the beasties first two CDs. I would half heartedly recomend the beasties third cd. but ILL COMMUNICATIONS really really sucks. its too bad they didnt retire. there is nothing influential innovative interesting or entertaining about this CD whatsoever.
1,the fall of the beastie boys!,this ablum mad me loose a lot of respect for this band. dont bull this . get some of there earlier stuff.
4,Sabotage,"Most everyone has heard Sabotage and for me thats reason enough to pick this cd up. But, as always with the Beastie Boys, there are many other songs that give this album merit. One of my favorites is root down. Very cool."
5,I don't know about the rest of their stuff but...,"I have to say that any serious hip hop beat freak will dig the funk on this album. Their earlier stuff is a little too frat boy dorm room let's get some chicks in our 'dope' party-ish sound. But this album shows some serious thought processes at work and some heavy philosophies at play. The beats are tight and the rhymes are strong, with more conviction than before and frankly this album is incredibly inventive and original in many ways. They are really exploring on this album and it's all good. The beats man. The beats are cruel, man. The theme of ill communication is also nice, with their voices muddied and fuzzed out. Some serious conceptualizing. deep. This album is a classic in all respects."
5,The Boys can do no wrong,"Just about ten years after the release of their first album, the Beastie Boys (not quite boys anymore) reveal that you can mature without losing your edge. ILL COMMUNICATION is so chocked with great songs that it might sound like a greatest hits anthology. It is also the eclecticism of the tunes that give off that feeling: there's punk, funk, old school stuff, retro 70s soul explosions, hints of reggae, jazz... and they make it sound so easy... none of it feels stiff or self-conscious.While later Beastie albums are also quite good, I think this is the one where they jumped the shark. But what a jump! Sure enough, the guys soon disbanded, but the good news is that they are releasing (or just have released) new music. What a welcome relief!"
3,Bizarre!,Acid trip+60's music+70's music+80's music+rap= Ill Communication. I have thousands of CDs. This is definitely one of a kind. There is nothing like it out there.Beastie Boys be Illin'
2,Re-Check Your Head,"Up until this point, Beastie Boys albums were groundbreaking events-the metal-rap hybrid License to Ill, the collage spectacular Paul's Boutique, and the live instrument anchored Check Your Head. Here is where the Beasties began to falter-this is nothing more than a complete retread of Head, with the same ratio of rap to punk to instrumentals. Only this time, the music is weaker, the raps less satisfying, the instrumentals more boring. (Even the cover art seems rehashed). The lyrics are different, but now the Boys are far more preachy and sanctimonious. Apart from ""Sabotage"" (which really isn't as good without the clever video) this record is forgettable."
3,Ok read,"This book was just ok for me. It was a good book, the characters and back story were good. I just didn't feel like this book was the bomb like the Hightower series."
4,The beginning of a saga not to be missed,"This book is like many firsts. It could have been thicker with details but the plot is solid and the books to follow are fantastic. The plot is solid SF fare with a political twist. Basically ""what would happen if corporations really DID take over most of the world"" is the backdrop for a seriously good read - even the 5th time around."
4,good series,"This is a good series and a good book, read this several years ago so i decided to add it to my collection thouhg i must say i sort of lost interest after the second book"
3,too much 'water',"I think this book could be 7 times thinner and it would not loose its value. I appreciate the contents, but the author seems to repeat same stuff over and over and I am skimming through it instead of really reading..."
5,First Things Last Things,It is a joy to re read Eric Hofer. It has been some 30 years ago that I first read his incredible notes on life.
3,Escapism at its Finest,"In Philadelphia Fire Wideman takes on the task of engaging with issues important to the African American community while at the same time presenting them from a modernist viewpoint. Yet topics such as voyeurism, fidelity, and even the title fire are left behind in the main character's escapism. Perhaps Wideman wants to show the disorienting effects society plays on the male African American mind. However, the style becomes tiresome, despite glimpses of simply beautiful writing, and halfway through I found myself looking for an escape as well."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,"I cannot BELIEVE that I paid almost six freakin' dollars for an 848 word DESCRIPTION of a product. That's right, if you think that you're buying Onfolio, YOU'RE NOT. You're buying a DESCRIPTION of Onfolio. Maybe you think that I should have been tipped off by the low price for a software program. Well, considering that Onfolio was FREE until Microsuck got it's money-grubbers involved and killed it to try to eliminate competition with its OneNote, $5.95 seemed like a reasonable price for what I thought was a ressurection of what used to be a great program.Had I read the fine print, I probably WOULD have known that I was not buying the program but only a few paragraphs telling me WHAT I ALREADY KNEW. But I didn't so now I feel very ripped off. THANK YOU AMAZON.COM!"
5,Great find!,The book was what it said it was. Service was on time. Looking forward to a good read this winter.
4,Good but not for beginners,"This was a good workout but a little hard to keep up with the moves. If I had not done a number of pilates DVDs before, I would have been lost. It will be a great DVD to work up to mastering but if you are brand new to pilates something else might be a good idea to start with."
3,You Are Never To Old Too Love A Computer: The Fearless Guide for Seniors,"While the book was somewhat helpful, the print date of this book is 2005 and it definitely needs updating. Things change very fast in the world of technology. Vista and Wi-Fi and two topics that are not addressed."
1,Less Than One Day,"This is the first bad review I've written here, but when you order a product that stops working the very same day you receive it, there's little else to do.I received the cradle via UPS today, and immediately set it up, docked the iPod and tested the remote. It worked fine. I went about the rest of my day, leaving my iPod and dock untouched on my desk.I sat down in the evening to use the computer and decided I wanted some music. The remote no longer worked. Nothing I did could fix the problem.My mistake was to cheap out, and order the least expensive dock I could find. Next time I'll know better. I don't recommend this for anyone who wants to use it for more than a few hours, every."
1,IPod Dock disappointment.,"I bought this item to use in my shop to hook my ipod into my sound systemInsten - Black Cradle v3.0 with Remote and Dock Plates for Apple iPod 40GB, 60GB, iPod nano (Gen 1 & 2), iPod mini 4GB, 6GB, iPod (video) 30GB, 60GB, 80GB, iPod Video U2 Special Edition, iPod 1 20GB, 30GB, iPod 20GB w/ Click wheel, iPod photo U2 Special..., When I received it, it was DOA. I contacted the seller and they told me to return it for exchange. After a couple of weeks, when I had not heard back from them, I contacted them again. I was shuffled around from department to department and finally reached someone in authority who agreed to just refund my Paypal account and stop all the confusion. The product, BAD! The customer relations, Good!! I would buy from the company again but not the same product."
5,Works Just Fine,"I had alot of apprehensions about picking up one of these because of all the nasty reviews. I went out on a limb and bought it though. I'm glad I did, the unit has good weight to it and it doesn't feel like a cheap plastic toy like some other stands. It fits my 2G Ipod Touch well with no compatibility issues. It does exactly what you would think it does i.e. output audio, charge your ipod, and keep it upright. Just to note, if you keep it plugged in all the time, it does emit a bright blue led so if that bothers you. I have it next to my nightstand where it makes a nice little night light...another plus! I don't understand why you would want to spend $70 to $100 on similar stands?"
4,Very good product for the price,"It's a very good product for the price. It works with my iPod Touch 2nd Generation, the remote control functions (Next/Previous, Vol Up/Vol Down, Play/Plause) all of them works with my iPod Touch.The only problem that I have is that the iPod Touch isn't very tightly docked to the base, so it isn't possible to use it in the car."
2,Not Very Durable,"I have washed this cover about four times and the waterproof liner has already ripped. On the plus side, it fits the Chicco Lullaby LX Playard, it is soft and my baby seems comfortable on it."
2,Beware - it shrinks,"We just bought this mattress pad after reading some great reviews. I tried it on before washing it and it fit great in our Pack 'n Play bassinet. I washed it - following the instructions, and it shrunk so much that now the bassinet pad bunches up. I'm not sure we're going to be able to use this waterproof pad at all, which is disappointing."
3,Serves intended purpose but it does not fit standard size mattress,"We got this from our baby registry off of amazon.com. Once we got it and opened the package, we realized that the product itself is intended for a mini-crib and not a standard size mattress. We will have to return it. Otherwise it definitely does serve its purpose of it being a high quality waterproof fitted quilted mattress pad cover."
5,American Waterproof Quilted Portable Mattress Pad,"Very pleased with this wonderful pad. It certainly met our hopes and expectations for a quality, comfortable pad for our grand baby's new mattress. Great transaction."
5,Perfect fit!,"This was perfect for the mattress I bought on Amazon to fit in my Pack n Play. I loved how even tho it was a waterproof one, it was still soft for the baby to sleep on!"
5,Excellent toning exercises!,"I love this workout. I've been doing it on and off for years, and it's super effective at lower body toning. It's only 28 minutes, but it packs a lot of punch, and Madeleine Lewis is great! The exercises are easy to follow, and Ms. Lewis reminds you of proper form. Generally I get bored with taped routines, but I like this one so much that I just purchased it again to replace the one I wore out."
2,I know she's a better writer than this book shows...,"I found this book to be depressing, and a disappointment after all the wonderful things I'd heard about Lamott and her other work.Mattie, the main character in this book, seemed to have no life and no aspirations to a life beyond her young children and sleeping with her sleaze of an ex-husband. I never got the impression that she placed any importance on working -- if I met her today, I'd probably tell her that if she would give some thought to what she wanted to be when she grew up, and then take some concrete steps toward achieving some goal, any goal, her life just might lift out of the morass it currently seems to be in.As a recently separated woman, I read this book thinking that it might give me some insight, but I really wasn't able to glean enough information about Lamott's protagonist to help."
1,Anne Lamott should be Anne Lament,"Anne Lamott's name should be Anne Lament because that's all her characters ever do. We enjoy reading about flawed characters because it reaffirms our own imperfections in life, however I can't stand whiny characters that never do anything positive to change their life's negative direction. Anne Lament's newly divorced main character makes a choice to fall for a MARRIED man while continuing to SLEEP with her newly MARRIED ex-husband. Hello, don't you have enough wobegone misery in your life already? Make some smart choices, don't get emotionally involved with married men, and don't read this book. It is horribly written. I just finished reading ""Life of Pi"" and the comparison between the two is astronomical. Pi good, Blue Shoe, bad. Skip it, life is too short to read about whiners who do nothing to improve their situation in life."
1,"Is it just me, or....","...is every single book Anne Lamott writes about herself and her family and friends? I LOVE her non-fiction, but the same people show up again and again in her novels, often quoting things she has already written in her memoirs. I have to wonder if Lamott is capable of writing any characters that aren't thinly disguised versions of people in her life, or of setting her novels anywhere but Marin County. She has taken ""write what you know"" to an extreme. A very disappointing book."
1,Woe is me!,"If only her fiction could be as interesting as her non-fiction! I labored through this book, thinking it would eventually become creative, funny, inspiring, but it just never got there. It was just painful, preachy reading. Hopeful for the next one!"
3,Good but not Great,"I'm an Anne Lamott fan...big time! But Anne's writing is her own brand of formula fiction and getting worn. Blue Shoe is a good read if you haven't read Traveling Mercies which is a great read. Anne seems to be getting tired and may need to explore another voice in her style.The big selling point of Anne's work is everyone thinks it is reflecting her own life. That may or may not be true. Keep in mind, this is fiction.All in all, if you're Anne fan, buy this one for your library. If you're not then try Traveling Mercies or Bird by Bird."
2,Lamott needs to leave the autobigraphical novel behind,"Anne Lamott is one of my favorite authors but she's never been able to pull off fiction in the same brilliant way she's mastered nonfiction. (Although ""Rosie"" came very close.) This is sadly evident in the ""The Blue Shoe' which is boring and forgettable.I still have hope for Anne. If she would just get out of her own head and create characters that are completely different from herself and the witty gang she hangs out with, I believe she'd have fiction worthy of celebration. (As long as she also included a liitle bit of plot in the mix as well.) The first rule most fiction authors learn is to leave the emotional, obviously autobiographical opuses behind. Lamott would do well to heed that advice."
5,Outstanding Messages in an Unheralded Film,"""By Dawns Early Light"" deals very effectively with many of todays results of our deteriorated culture. Bad parenting, failed government schools, obsession with material replacements substituted for real personal relationships and a constant decaying of values that worked effectively for generations are exposed and corrected with warmth and humor. There are nuggets for both genders and all ages to make you smile, laugh and think about changes you might consider for yourself and those close to you. The message is presented in such a fashion, you will want to see this little gem and share it with others for whom you care over and over."
5,"The Stones Roll, or I mean Rule","Great Album.... if you like Rock, you gotta have some stones in your collection and this is arguably the best Rolling Stones LP."
1,All hype and No Substance,"I really tried to like this book but found the main ""source"" to be ""we found out"" without giving a clue at just how this happened. The writing is of very poor quality yet worded in a crafty manner to imply far more than the actual documentation and evidence supports.This is conjecture and opinion loosely strung together with an occasional fact. It also does a real hatchet job on the lovely City of New Orleans and portrays it in the most unflattering manner I have ever encountered.I kept reading hoping to get to the ""good parts"" where all the secrets were unearthed and startling revelations made but there were none. Not even mildly entertaining!I'd have to say it is not quite ready for prime time!"
1,Not for me.,"I tried, really I did, to read these books. They were very difficult to understand. I even did an online discussion with ""experts"" to try to figure out what was going on, but it just didn't happen. I read ""As I Lay Dying"" entirely & the story behind the story told by the ""experts"" was okay, but did not make the read worth the time. The 2nd book, I couldn't get past the first few chapters & by the third book, I had given up. Definitely not my style."
2,Faulkner Book Trio,"Only people who are masochists would enjoy these books. Extremely difficult to understand, no make that impossible, unless you are reading a reader's guide somewhere that interprets the books for you. There is little or no real insight into human problems to reward you for having struggled through such a mess. I only bought them because Faulkner is so well known, but I have better things to do with my time. As I Lay Dying is the only book I finished."
5,Great ball machine,"The basic Tennis Tutor is an excellent ball machine for club players, from beginner to advanced. I am an old geezer tennis nut and have used several ball machines over the years, including the Tennis Tutor Plus. I just bought the Tennis Tutor and love it. It has all the great features of the Plus but is much more portable, being a bit lighter but more importantly, much smaller. It's very easy to just pick up with the handle and easy to roll on the wheels with the puller handle. It will fit in the trunk of any car. The 85 mph shot is more by far than needed for good practice. It lacks only the spin control and I don't miss it at all. Set properly, the ball dips nicely over the net for low volley practice. When the ball strikes the ground it picks up forward spin (topspin) so your groundie practice is still against moderate topspin. It's also very quiet, won't bother anyone on the next court. Buy one, practice 100 lobs with it, and you won't miss an overhead for two months!"
4,Lauren's Bound for Orgon Review,This book is pretty good when you start to read it. It has interesting points of view from the children on their way to Oregon and how they travel on their way.
3,Bound for Oregon: Dull and Long,"Bound for Oregon by Jean Van Leeuwen, was a book about a 9-year old girl about her journey through the Oregon Trail. It starts out in Arkansas(which was a little odd because most people traveled around Arkansas because all they saw at first was swamps)at their home. She talks about how they moved to Arkansas because of all the illness that was going around. After a while, I lost interest in this book because it was so boring. It stopped having any adventure and got very monotonous.The setting was in Arkansas sat first and then all the way along the Oregon Trail. I recommend this book to no one."
5,NOT SELF CHARGING!!,This product is great at what it is. BUT BE WARNED- it is not a self charging station. It basically is just another miniUSB cable (like the one that comes with the ps3) and a holding dock. You still need to turn on your ps3 to have it charge the controller.
3,"Christian based, lot of theory, no practice","I found the book to be easy to read, honest and informative. But I found no tools for shadow ""work"", I would call it shadow ""theory"". Also, it was Christian based, which I found difficult to follow at times (being my knowledge of Christianity so little). I found ""The dark side of the light chasers"" much more practical.But if you are looking for an introduction about the shadow, and are Christian or have enough knowledge about the subject, this could be the book for you."
4,toe curling,"in german with german actors, production ofcourse;this is the almost verbatim meeting held in the city of the title where the german elite explained just how they were going to exterminate the jews entirely...the cover-up,how they would make it look and sound palapable,going over details without euphamisims. difficult to watch,but needed. we seem to have already begun willing to repeat the horrible mistakes we promised to learn from...there is an american version with kenneth branagh and stanley tucci that is as good,but lacks the story in and told by germans...it is called the ""conspiracy"" on dvd..."
4,Great Effort,Paul does a really good job here. He mixes up the styles of songs and gives you a little bit of everything. We all know he can play like no one else. Its great to see how versatile he is. I think he may have even held back a bit and could have even shredded some more. The song construction and arangements are solid though and will translate well on the G3 tour I am sure. I love the first track...very innovative. Always excited to hear new material from Mr. Gilbert. A true legend in his own time.
4,Great Composition as well as Excellent Playing,"What can I say, I want more! Paul is extremely talented as this CD testifies. The songs are different and do not wear the listener out.If you enjoy instrumentals by Joe Satriani or Steve Vai I think you will find this CD is very similar."
4,Coppertone,"I like the smell of Weekend By Burberry, although not enough to buy a bottle, maybe another sample. The floral notes are a little too strong. This cologne kind of smells like Coppertone to me, which isn't a bad thing. Actually I use Coppertone because I prefer the smell over the other brands. Weekend By Burberry comes across as very linear, basically smelling the same from the opening though the dry down. The projection is very good, maybe too good. Although that could be because I put too much on the first time. I can imagine buying another sample of this during the winter when I miss the warm sunny days of summer at the beach slathered in Coppertone."
2,Musty smell,"The scent was kinda musty, didn't smell like anything that pleasant. I prefer ""fresher"" smelling colognes, not ones that people may think you are wearing day-old clothes."
4,Good job!,"Horowiz manages to create very earthy, historical surroundings in this book with likable characters. A very good read though a little slow in places."
2,Lots of glitches,"I can only complain so much, because I paid all of $130 for this on a Best Buy closeout. However, despite firmware updates, the machine will not play Blu-rays by 20th Century Fox; nor would it play ""Zohan,"" from Sony. Also, lip-syncing problems are common on other Blu-ray discs. On the upside, the picture on the Blu-ray discs that do play is very good, as is upconversion of standard DVD's."
2,No Longer Works!!,"This player worked great when I first got it, however, the latest blu-ray dvd's will not play! Pirates of the Caribean, 3:10 to Yuma, and any other new disk. The new firmware upgrade didn't help at all. I suggest buying a PS3. Stay away from this player!"
1,Firmware/Software Issues,"I received this unit and the first thing I got when I loaded a Blu-Ray disc was a ""This disc cannot be played"" message. I updated the firmware from Samsung's site and loaded using the CD method. After the upgrade I still receive this message. Tried a second Blu-Ray movie and get the same message. Standard DVDs work fine, but the Blu-Ray movies just give me the same message. Samsung's tech support could only offer the firmware solution (which I've already tried), and told me to call back to ""Level 2"" tech support. Anyone else have similar issues? If so, how did you get past them? I'm sure the player is a great purchase, I just can't get past this initial problem."
5,Please rate item - not Amazon or affiliates,"I have purchased SanDisk miniSD Cards and card readers and so far they are excellent items and simple to use.There are a couple of reviewers here who are marking lower ratings on this item, when it's not the item they are rating. They are wanting to rate Amazon or affiliates.Please do not rate this item low when you have an issue with Amazon or someone else. And if you order from an affiliate make sure it's a new item, not a used item. You take the risk on used items.Call Amazons or the affiliates customer service when you have an issue with them and not the product."
5,Just Perfect..,"As expected, another great product from a trusted company. Now planning to get another similar product with more capacity in the near future."
4,san disk 512 mn transflash,Could not get the music to download to my phone. It is difficult to figure out and I still have not been able to do it.
5,Interesting,"Focuses on how Pink Floyd developed their style through previous albums and evolved to become the iconic group they are. Majority of the video talks about their releases BEFORE Meddle, but it is necessary back-story to understand their motivations and how Meddle came to be."
3,Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii,"Having seen this in 1974 in the movie theater,I was disappointed at the fact that the ""directors cut"" did exactly that , they cut part of the concert out !!!That is why I bought it . I feel ripped off by the director .This much different from the original movie . It's not nearly as good toward the end ."
5,Pink Floyd - Live at Pompeii Outstanding!!!!!!,"If you are a fan of Pink Floyd, this video is a must have! The addition of the Directors Cut is a very interesting plus! I had always listened to Pink Floyd since I was a teenager and having many of the Floyds albums I was amazed that I had never even heard of the Live at Pompeii movie. I stumbled across some videos on the internet that were from the film and I purchased the video via Amazon.Com. Upon viewing the video when I received it, which came rather quickly, a renewed pashion for the Pink Floyd music struck me. I have since ordered ""Pulse"" on DVD and ""Meddle"" on CD which I should receive tomorrow.Shine On You Crazy Diamonds!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Not a ""Live"" DVD","Guess I was expecting a concert with live performance and an audience. This is a melange of video with enough personal shots that now have some value, kind of like the old documentaries of Bob Dylan. Disappointed."
3,Quick read and good story,"I selected this book looking for a quick read on a short flight.I am pleased to say that this book kept me quite entertained and I now find a new interest in Tudor history.The story goes on a bit long with the political this and that between the church and government...probably more than Anne Boleyn would have really put into her diary...but it kept the situation in perspective.I would say that this is certainly not die-hard history, but if you want an introductory look into Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth I, or Henry XIII this would be a good start."
2,not to good,this book goes from elizabeth I to Anne Boleyn's life. It was an ok book but doesn't tell a lot of either. I wouldn't recommend this book for the price.
4,A Good History Lesson,"This book was a history lesson yet it actually kept me interested. It's about the life and struggles of Queen Anne and the secret diary she kept throughout her life and up until her death. No one knows about this diary besides Anne, her servant, and now many years after her death, her daughter, Queen Elizabeth. I definitely would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in the history of England royalty."
5,A page-turning must read!,"Having just finished reading The Secret Diary of Anne Boleyn, I can comfortably say it is one of the best historical fiction books I've ever read. Robin Maxwell is a genius! Whether or not the premise is close to truth, one can't help but be taken in to Anne's world. Through her words I have lived alongside Anne Boleyn. This book is a must read for anyone who is fascinated with Tudor history."
5,GREAT,This book was received in good condition and very timely. For anyone who likes history this is a wonderful book to read.
2,Shallow,"The premise behind this book is a great idea, but poorly executed by Maxwell. The characters are shallow and repetitive - how many times did she work in Anne Boleyn's sixth finger?! I kept waiting for Elizabeth to have some interesting reflection about her mother, but none came. Someone else should write what this book could have been."
3,plastic case,"I cheaped out on replacing my battery and went for this one. It locked into my powerbook fine, no problem, and it charged up and behaved pretty much as I expected it to. It even has the little button and lights on the bottom.But folks should be aware:1) The battery case is plastic, not aluminum, and in spite of being painted gray, it does not match the powerbook case.2) The rubber foot does not match the quality of the original-- it wore down to nothing in a few weeks like a cheap eraser.HOWEVER: this may have saved my powerbook after an unexpected impact on the corner with the battery-- the plastic battery case cracked, but everything else works fine. The aluminum casing would have transferred more force to the main case. YMMV..."
5,Kings Row,"Rediscover the lost art of melodrama with Sam Wood's peerless ""Kings Row"". The film's strength lies in its subtle transformation from wholesome Americana into a dark tale of madness and evil, transcending any sentimental, dated attributes. Unquestionably, our 40th President did his finest screen work here, and Cummings fits the stolid, noble Parris to a tee. This combined with Sheridan's star-wattage and a top-notch Warners supporting cast (including Claude Rains, Judith Anderson, and Charles Coburn) makes Kings Row a town well worth visiting."
1,unhelpufl,"seems like everything in this book was written 20 years ago, is it even updated? Way better books and mags out there, don't waste your time, or your money."
3,Interesting but boring,"It took me a day to read this book. it was rather boring than interesting. Book has some clear points compared to other convoluted design patterns books, but i can't say i m a big fan of their style."
3,Good book at a reasonable price,"The trouble with computer/development books is they are so darn expensive. I was able to locate this one at a reasonable price, the seller shipped it quickly, and I am happy with the purchase. The only comment I have on the book, is this copy came from a public library (stamped inside) and as such the front/back covers are a little beat. I'm sure if this copy were used by just a person this wouldn't be the case, but I suppose live and learn on what a 'used book' really means, right? Overall I am satisfied and would do business with the seller again... after all you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, and this one was a bargain for what its teaching me."
4,A fun way to learn Patterns,"Patterns are boring. This book makes them fun. How they did it, I'll never know."
5,Excellent Reading Material,This is an excellent reading material with good explaination of the concepts.
1,The Teaching Style Doesn't Come Close To Working For Me,I purchased this book based on the strength of its high review scores. I'll be more careful in the future and spend time reading the negative reviews as well. I find this style of teaching to be tedious and distracting. I much prefer teaching that is brief and to the point.As someone has already pointed out - you'll either love it or hate it.
1,Stupid book for stupid people.,"This is by far the most stupid book ever written on the subject of design patterns. If you enjoyed this book, or if you found its style to be useful in learning, then you have no right working in the software development field. This book is written by dummies for dummies. Period!Sure, you may learn a few things about design patterns, but you did it using child like learning methods. That should raise some red flags about your ability to understand complex technical subjects like a grown adult. If you cannot learn from real sources, then please, please, please, stay away from any sort of programming career."
2,"Tedious, exasperating","Indeed, repetition and elaboration are the two pillars for memorizing. But distraction is not. Silly, unhelpful graphics, the obsession with pizza and coffee, the pre-teen jokes, and not least all the spelling errors just distract too much.All I could think of during the first one hundred pages, before I gave up, was ""GET ON WITH IT!"" Did the repetition at least help me memorize the first patterns? No. But I now know there is a difference between Chicago and NY pizzas.Already had the Design Patterns book by the Gang-of-four and was hoping this tome might indeed help call up the necessary patterns during programming, but I'll just go through the GoF book again.Two stars for trying."
5,Great book,If U are new to design patters or u even read the GoF book and are little familiar with them. This book will realy get u on them and load them into your brain so u have them with U when u need them :)
3,lachinov,"Nothing special in terms of ""load patterns into your brain in a way that sticks"". Otherwise another description of patterns that can be easily found online."
1,"Childish, obtuse, and 10x longer than it needed to be.","This book contains so many comics, cartoonish diagrams, and lame jokes it's impossible to learn from it efficiently.The highly acclaimed ""Design Patterns"" by Gamma et al is only half as long and three times more informative.I suppose I would still recommend Head First to someone who was taking a programming course involuntarily and would rather be watching MTV, but not to someone with an actual need for knowledge in the subject."
4,Good but hard for a new programmer,"Great concepts but a little hard to read if your not the greatest at Object Oriented programming approaches. Would be a great book for someone surrounded by experienced programmers and not a ""Lone Ranger"" at their company."
4,Scottish Historical Documents,Haven't had time to read this yet. I scanned a few documents and it's quite a bit to take in. I have gladly added it to my collection of Scottish material. Very proud to own it from Amazon.
4,Gazpacho soup is fine,Amazon wants a review of the gazpacho soup. It's perfectly OK soup; what else can I say? I got gazpacho and Vichysoisse thru Amazon from same store because impossible to find these cold soups in ordinary supermarket.
4,Great But songs are Old,"This is a great CD, its been out for a while and the songs are old...from the albums before Surfacing. Most of these tracks came off records and B Sides from those records. ... Its a great time to get it. If you like Sarah......its a must have. Especially if you like DJ music."
1,Boring and Slow,Most of these songs are not even remotely techno or electronica. They are just boring songs with a slightly less boring beat. I literally thought that I was going to fall asleep and drive off the road when I put this CD into the player. These songs would be great if you just want to relax on a rainy day while you read a book. They sound more like MUZAK than anything else.
5,Sarah Mclachlan has found a new audience!,I think a lot of people bought this album because Ms. McLachlan has not yet released anything new or want to attain a copy of Silence. Silence is a great song for Ms. McLachlan....but the real jewel of this album is Sweet Surrender. It compliments Sarah's voice and retains the dark emotion of the original.
4,Worth buying!,"Sarah's Remixed CD is great! 9 of Sarah's most memorable songs were remixed into great mixes that you can dance to. The track listing is as follows: 1. Fear - Hybrid Mix 2. Sweet Surrender - DJ Tiesto Mix 3. Angel - Rollo Mix 4. I Love You - BT Mix 5. Silence - DJ Tiesto Mix 6. Possession - Rabbit In The Moon Mix 7. Black - William Orbit Mix 8. Hold On - BT Mix (Edit) 9. Plenty - Fade Mixwhile I don't think any of the mixes are as great as the originals, this CD is still worth buying."
2,drum machine galore,"Unfortunately, these remixes add no value to the originals.I like House genre (I even own Hybrid's ""Wide Angle"" and DJ Tiesto's ""In my memory"") but fancy synthesizer tricks don't necessarily add value.The only one that does is the Sanctuary Mix for ""Silence"" which was raved on about and for very good reason - it transformed the original and enhanced it way beyond it's initial uninspiring form, however, it is not on this CD. [The Sanctuary Mix was the only CD-Single I ever bought.]I see no evidence remixing has gone beyond filling-up a CD-Single."
5,Great read aloud for my classroom!,I have read the Junie B. books aloud to my first graders and they enjoy each of the stories. I am very pleased with this book and my order!
5,Cheater Pants,"I liked the book because Junie B. Jones was always getting in trouble at school. First, Junie B.Jones copied Mays homework. This caused her to get in trouble with Mr.Scary and her Mom and Dad. The problem was that Junie B. Jones was a cheater pants. She does learn her lesson and decides never to cheat again. But that didn't last long because Herb helped her on the spelling test. She cheated again! Two days in a row she cheated. Herb and Junie B. couldn't sleep that night. So to make themselves feel better they went and told on themselves to Mr. Scary. She got in trouble again and was given another talk about cheating by her Mom and Dad. But the best thing of all was that Mr. Scary trusted her again because of her honesty."
4,Uncle Mike,"Mike Reilly was my grandma's brother, so I found this memoir to be fascinating. As a history reader it has merit as well, offering insights into the world of the White House, the fear and diplomacy of the war era, and some views of the Yalta and Cairo conferences. The culture clash between the Arab delegation on a Navy ship and the author's attitude to them in the 40's is interesting in light of today's ""troubles"" in that region.Robin MacDonaldHughson, CA"
1,About some of the most innocently racist stuff ever,"The guy is a committed academic in his desire to recreate the past for the purpose of informing the present, however every sentence falls further into the abyss of conjecture, innocently naive racism, and personal interpretation based on religious beliefs, both his and his personal ideas about turn of the millennium Judaism. He is a great read if you want ridiculously dated material on the social concepts that lead to passive (non-violent) racism. Don't rely on it for real facts, free of confusing personal interpretation. Needed more pictures too :)"
4,Must Read,"This book is a must read for financial survival. Prechter has an engaging writing style. His opinions are often outrageous and sometimes too extreme. This value of this book is in that it is so different from the conventional financial press.Almost alone Prechter predicted the great bull market back in 1979. He then called the top prematurely but at least he did warn this readers that a top was coming. The scope of Prechter's vision is awesome. He has charts with trendlines going back to 1700 with projections for the next century.Chapter 11 ""Manifestations of Investor Psychology"" is very powerful."
1,Amazon Seller never sent item!,The Amazon Seller never sent the item. It is 31 days after the one click purchase. Seller did not respond to emails. Amazon did not respond. Review of feedback shows this seller has a very bad track record. Amazon doesn't seem to care about the reputation of those it lists. Buyers beware.
5,all ok,"this product works well, the packaging intact, no problems so far. The shipment arrived very fast to Peru, thanks for all."
5,Mighty boosh box set,"This show is great i grew up watching red dwarf on channel 9 and have had a withdrawl of good british comedy since, this fills the gap its great show too bad they went on tour instead of keeping the series going."
5,Martin scorsese.........scores here,"I am sure you have read some of the reviews so what I do is give an opinion. This thriller has it all, a great storyline and some interesting and surprising twists the atmospher you can feel and the cinematography great Martin Scorsese has put together a superior thriller and shows he can do much more than war story's. I highly recommend this is a must for anyone's library who likes movies of this genre. I will always tell it like I see it.....Good or bad.SCOTT M"
3,Another mistaken reality film.,"I don`t know which film was shot first but this film bears striking resemblance to ""The Ward"". Leo usually does movies that are much better than this one like Inception."
1,El Stinko,This was a very boring movie. It seemed to never end. Don't waste your time watching it. Very disappointing.
2,I didn't like it,"There are two ways to look at ""Shutter Island"".If an average director made it, then it would be a pretty decent movie. However, since it was made by Martin Scorsese, I expect a lot more. When you are among the best directors, you have high expectations...which I felt that this movie did not fullfill. This movie looks a lot better in the trailer than it did played out over it's full length.Most of ""Shutter Island""is pretty good, as far as the casting (Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Kingsley are great), the scenery is effective, and the sound lends to the atmosphere.I just thought that the story was lame (NOTE, I am purposely not going into the plot since it will impact/reveal the mystery). When the film is all done, you feel as though you watched a ""Scooby Doo"" ending.This atmospheric movie is a weak Scorsese film. It would best be compared to ""Cape Fear"" whic was far more effective."
3,Mixed Feelings On This One,"This is Martin Scorsese doing another salute to Hitchcock, as with his remake of ""Cape Fear"", and obviously having FUN doing it. But I expect a master filmmaker like Scorsese, who knows EVERY film genre and technique like the back of his hand, to take a familiar genre the average filmmaker would MAKE average, and create a film that kicks it up MORE then a few extra notches; But unlike ""Cape Fear"", I don't feel he succeeded THIS time around.The movie is ""Popcorn"" okay and watchable, and it's NO surprise why it was a such a huge box-office hit. But ironically, the twists and turns of the adapted screenplay (I haven't read the novel), most especially the twist at the end, is MUCH closer to the now too-familiar style of M. Night Shyamalan, rather than Hitchcock, which stunts it's ability to be anything MORE than what it COULD HAVE been, even FROM a gifted filmmaker such as Scorsese."
3,It was very good... until the end,"1. I know the end of the movie is just a small percentage of the film, but... it's the end; it obviously brings the whole film together and thus it was a huge let down / dissapointment when at the end (well, you'll have to watch it... or just perhaps skip this film). Other than the end, which makes the entire film illogical, the writing / acting was excellent. But again, once you're done with the film, you'll be asking yourself ""what's the point of the film?"""
2,Possibly Scorsese's weakest film.,"The biggest issue is that if you can't figure out the ending within the first five minutes of this movie then you must be new to watching movies or reading books. From there, it just follows the numbers. Uninspired."
5,Fantastic thriller!!,This is a great movie!Keeps your attention through the whole movie.The acting is great and the movie is well written with lots of twist and turns. Leonardo at his best!
3,cape fear meets every single movie ever made.,"scorsese : perfect. camerawork, cinematography, lighting, etc....all on point. it alot of aspects he borrowed very heavily from Hitchcock....very heavily. it worked to the movies favor.actors. dicaprio : love his acting but this was not his best by a long shot. weak boston accent and loads of overacting....that said im thinking its not his fault entirely because....and the reason for the three stars...that script : horrible. really weak story that completely rips off many, many movies before it. not gonna ruin it...but you will very very quickly figure out the mystery.this movie looks amazing but thats about it."
4,Blu-Ray Shutter Island,Pretty good movie which I had never heard of. Unusual ending. A little bit morbid for some but I enjoyed it considerably.
1,boring,"Love Scorcese. Wanted to like this movie, but going into it... and this isn't entirely Scorcese's fault, it started to remind me of a movie called ""The Ninth Configuration,"" which was written by the same guy who did Exorcist. these are basically the same two formulas, but with different characters. I'm sorry, but Shutter Island had this feeling the whole time like it was trying too hard to be spooky. That's Scorce's fault. He makes a good movie, then does some clunkers, then makes a great movie. then more clunkers. this is a clunker. One man's opinion."
3,Depends,"Without giving anything away, I think that if you have not seen a similar story made into a movie, then this should be a brilliant watch for you. I'm not sure why it received an R rating, as this felt more like a stereo typical PG-13/14 sitting. They pretty much had me up until a certain turning point, at which they lost me nearly entirely. Great acting and direction, along with a little bit of a been there done that, makes up my 3/5 star rating. Lastly, I do think my expectations were greater."
5,DVD not to miss!,Shutter Island is a DVD to watch if you like to expect the unexpected! Amazon.com shipped it fast and at a great price.
3,A beginning...A middle...,"****SPOILER ALERT*****The movie just ends out of nowhere. The credits started to roll and I had to check and see if I had a bad disc that skipped to the end or something. Half of the movie was decent. Laying down clues for you to attempt to figure out what was happening. But it just ends out of nowhere with no solid crux to it.Hollywood just loves to make the movies about mental wards. Why do they always show the scene with a patient raking the lawn. It's always the same scenes in these movies; tunnels, mazes, lighthouses, barred prison cells. Hurricanes, knocking out the power. On and on.The cinematography was well done, except for some gore.This movie was predictable after halfway through I was acting out the lines before they happened! Although I have yet to read the book it appears as if it is an adaptation the couldn't recreate all the book wanted to tell.3 Stars"
2,Is it over yet?,A few disturbing scenes with a wanna be Andrea Yates and jump out heart attack spots didn't cut it. My wife and I fell asleep half way through it.
5,Awsome Thriller,"This movie is a suspenseful, awsome thriller. Very well thought out and takes you on a journey through the other side. Leonardo isn't hard on the eyes either :)"
1,ONLY GOOD FOR ONE VIEWING,"Once you see the ending of this film, there is absolutely no reason to watch it again. The dumbest plot since ""Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis."" A complete let-down."
4,Entertaining movie,"I saw the trailer in the theater and thought that I would like to check it out. As soon as it became available on Red Box I rented it. I don't have blue ray or even HDTV but the picture quality was vividly amazing from the first scene to the last. The acting is superb and the characters are believable. Almost from the beginning I found myself trying to figure out the twist. I knew there was one and as the story played on I changed my mind several times about what I thought the twisted plot was. It was enjoyable for me to watch a movie that allowed me to engross my brain. I was entertained until the very end and was not disappointed in the ending. The only reason I didn't give this movie five stars is because it reminded me very much of another movie which starred Johnny Depp. I won't tell the title of that movie as it may be a ""spoiler"" to some. So I'll just keep it a ""Secret""."
3,"Good Suspense, Story Line, Too easy to figure out",Would recommend even though I thought it too easy to figure out from start. Still a good watch.
4,Freaky Ending! I loved it!,"My favorite part of this book was the ending! This book has an ending that will shock you but at the same time make you wonder why you didn't see it yourself. The ending is freaky and I loved it!This book is about a U.S. Marshal that is sent to Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane on Shutter Island in Maine to look for a missing patient. He has to crack all these different codes while looking for the patient. The thing is though is that somehow his life with his wife (now dead) is somehow involved in the missing patient, Ashcliffe, Shutter Island and more...This book kept me guessing...and as soon as I thought I had it all figured out it threw me a curve ball. I couldn't put this one down! During the middle of the book I got a little restless with it just because it was a little confusing and a little crazy, but it picked back up soon enough! This was a great scary story read for Halloween...now I can't wait to see the movie!"
4,A Favor Returned,"I really enjoyed this book. I found the characters to be very interesting and believable. It was intriguing to see how Jennie's well-intentioned good deed could change so drastically the lives of others. I couldn't put the book down because I realy wanted to find out what would happen to these people I had come to care about. Even after finishing the book, I still find myself thinking about Jennie and Ross and how she affected so many lives with her special gift. I would recommend this book highly."
3,Somewhat better than Hard Contact,"This is the second in the series. The author does a better job this time in fleshing out the characters. I cared a little more about what happened to them this time than I did in the previous book.Unfortunately the plot is still substandard. It's kinda interesting but it doesn't really pick up much steam and doesn't climax well.It's another decent read for Star Wars fan. Somewhat better than the first ""Hard Contact"" book but I'd still classify it as mediocre."
3,"Cheap, but poor picture quality","This card works nicely; Hauppage cards tend to play well with others. However, the anti-aliasing of this card is poor, poor, poor. See http://techreport.com/reviews/2005q2/tuner-comparo/index.x?pg=10Most of the people here that say that the card has good picture quality have probably never tried another card. If you want good picture quality, go with another tuner."
3,Works... for now,"The card works(with analog signals)but keep in mind most good windows PVR software will cost you as much as this card does. The included software is terrible except for just watching TV (but no program guide!!!).I haven't used it with a game system but I did notice very long delays with a VCR hooked up.It's ok at the price, and the competition isn't any better."
4,Not quite a cliffhanger...,"This is an interesting book but hard to characterize in just a few words. The book certainly offers a comprehensive perspective of Hill's climbing experience from her first climbs as a teenager to recent years. The personal perspectives of many of the key rock climbers of the 70s, 80s and 90s that she offers in this book are often insightful, humorous and touching.However, I think the reason why I give this 4 stars (versus 5 stars) is that I felt that it was missing a bit of the spirit that characterizes the best books of the climbing genre. Even the opening chapter where she describes her fall is missing just a little bit that make it less gripping. There is definitely a lot to like in this book but I can't help but think that it could have been just a touch better."
1,Grocery store music,"Not much innovation here. If you enjoy elevator and grocery store music, this is for you. Otherwise, I'd look elsewhere."
5,GREAT REMIX,"This single is definitely worth picking up. The 14+ minute Englespost great remix of ""Darkness"" is a really enjoyable, pounding, house-shaking version that bears little resemblance to the album track. Also, the radio edit of ""Burn"" differs dramatically from the version on the ""Hit"" set."
1,The Sottish Rambler,"Like being trapped by a drunk who insists in telling you his incoherent life story with special emphasis on his resentments, puerile philosophical insights, and excerpts from bad Irish and C&W music. Don't go there. Galway was a nice town, it may still be, but there must be better ways to experience it."
3,The Guards,"Overall I enjoyed reading this book, but Bruen's writing style is different and I found it sometimes difficult to follow. Because I was a captive audience and it's all I had to read at the time, I plowed through it and actually enjoyed it. To be fair, this is his first novel I read so maybe the second one will be easier."
4,Try to find a used copy,"I found this completely by accident at local record store, and wasn't sure what I'd be listening to. I was pleasantly surprised. Her voice takes some getting used to, but this disc really grew on me. I love the cover of the Breeders' ""Head to Toe"", and the instrumentals are cool and mellow. A lot critics said this record never gets beyond cool and mellow, but I suspect they were waiting for Kim Deal to come out and sing. Josephine's a talented lady, and her music will grow on you."
4,"Some omissions, but nice tie-in with the movie","There are better collections of Shakespeare's works. The main sellint point here is obviously the tie-in with the movie, but it's still a very nice book.If you liked the movie and want to read more romantic words from Shakespeare, you can hardly go wrong with this."
5,to real for confort,"if you are looking for a film that captures children in poverty then this is probably one you should watch.all the kids in this film are not actors. they are actual real life homeless kids that were picked up for this film.their natural ways were implemented in this film and we get to see what happens to them, they steal for food and end up in a juvenile home, where they are subject to abuse by the gaurds and inmates. the realism of the film is what makes it so good. the way we feel about the main character is that we want to embrace him, take him away so that we dont have to see or believe that this is the world we live in. A powerfull and moving film that should make you think more about children in poverty, i know i did. This film doesnt hold anything back. Be warned that there is some child nudity and a brief rape scene, but dont let this change your mind. if you like foreign films then this is a definite keep."
4,Hauntingly Infective,"I saw this film in the theater as a first release movie and still remember its disturbing images to this day. While most movies show the innocent dream world we like to think children live in, Pixote slithers and crawls through a dark and surreal world unknown to most of us -- yet it is a world with recondite beauty because Pixote knows no other. We see things happen that would be totally unacceptable in the antiseptic world of civilization but our little protagonists does not seem to see his world as anything but normal. With the self-survival morals of any jungle animal, he goes about his day-to-day life. And this juxtaposing of morals leads to a little bit of an internal conflict with the viewer before the end of the movie. I highly recommend this film to anyone but would warn you that if the ""Pollyanna"" world of children is what you think exists and want to see, this film with keep you awake for quiet a few nights."
2,Don&#65533;t buy this book if you&#65533;re a Foodie!,"Unless you're a complete novice you'll be disappointed with this book, I was. How do you know if you're a foodie? Well if you already knew that 1) lemon juice can be used to keep certain vegetables, such as artichokes from rusting 2) that short grain rice is sticky and long grain rice is fluffy 3) that starches, such as corn starch, can be used for thickening, you're a foodie. I guess I expected more science explained but most of what I discovered was very basic. That's not to say that I didn't learn anything, I did, but most of the info I had already gleaned from other sources such as Food TV. Plus as stated in an earlier review, the book lacks a bibliography so even if you wanted to learn more about a certain subject you can't find it easily."
3,Looks detailed but not totally honest,"I love cookbooks with detailed tested recipes and photos of he results. This looked like one. However, I made the deep, dark chocolate tart (p. 42). First, by the size in the photo, this was made in an 8 or 9 inch tart pan, not a 12"" one (look at the the thickness of the result). Second, I used Scharfenberger bittersweet chocolate -- it I'd not turn out anywhere as dark (I suppose not a surprise given the amount of cream in the mix). It tasted great but didn't look anything like the photo. The book is good. It has a lot of useful information and I'd buy it again. But, until I try a recipe , I wouldn't totally trust it."
2,a bit disappointed,"As traditional sports fans, sons were a bit disappointed in coverage; only have 2 issues so will wait and see: price was excellent, very fast delivery, no hidden charges"
2,Sportscenter on Paper: Colorful and fast but offers no depth,"I've subscribed to ESPN and The Sporting News for a couple years now. When my subscriptions end, I won't be renewing ESPN.I want detailed sports information, in-depth stories and the kind of details I can't find in my morning copy of USA Today. Instead, ESPN delivers a Maxim-esque version of sports with lots of popular culture reference and clip art. And plenty of ads for gold jewelry, cell phones and men's body spray.I used to complain more but I've come to realize the magazine is a reflection of SportsCenter -- a show that has devolved into a series of annoying euphemisms for home runs, slam dunks and touchdowns.Bottom line: If you love SportsCenter, you'll love ESPN magazine. If not, look at the newly-redesigned The Sporting News or Sports Illustrated."
2,Not a good mag,"Very dissatisfied, too many ads and not enough variety. First 3 issues I received, basketball, college basketball and college football dominated the content. I understand that it's that time of year, but there needs to be more. I also have a subscription to SI and they do a decent job of variety."
2,I should have known,"First I'll say that I will watch ESPN while complaining about ESPN. They know they can get by regurgitating the same crap all day long throwing in random ""analysis"" and making a huge deal about as many small subjects as they possibly can. If your going to read a sports magazine SI is the way to go. The ESPN magazine is huge and full or random crap lots of pictures and twitter posts. Its 90% football most of the time with half pages (if that) given to some of the smaller sports. Overall its just not much content inside you can get a good deal on it I got if for a year for only 1$ but it just made the old magazine pile in the basement look rediculous."
3,Where is it?,"This magazine is still fairly good. I got this magazine again because it was a good deal and I always wanted a peek online for espn Insider.However, since it look like I was renewing the magazine they shipped it to my old college address. I bet some guy is really enjoying it. Won't get the next two either because they print out the labels already so I'll have to wait. It's probably 4 issues pass before I ever get it.Also because I haven't got the issues I can't even access espn insider because I don't have my account number which is printed on your label that comes with the magazine. Fantastic really. Fantastic."
3,Chi Gung Not Iron,"It's Ok The Chi Gung Part is good,Iron body is to little information.He try to put tomuch in too little a time.aikitroy"
1,"Agree - Buy Cards, not book","For starters, be careful that if you are starting out with this program, that you must start with ""Volume I"". ""Volume II"" is apparently another set of words that the book states you must have completed ""Volume I"" as a prerequisite before moving on to ""Volume II."" The majority of the book is one page each of the 100 flash cards with the front & back shown. There is a small write up that you can read as each card is introduced, but it really doesn't seem very helpful to me, and if anything, just something boring to read. Pretty much, this seems to be a vocabulary memorization type system & the flash cards will be fine. The flash cards are numbered in the order the book recommends you present / learn them. For a homeschool plan, I plan to give my kids 3 words per week for the school year with occasional reviews.English from the Roots Up Flashcards, Vol. 1"
5,Genius...that's all I can say,"Howard Shore brings each of these movies to life with these amazing segments of music. But I believe of the three soundtracks, this one wins. Though the orchestra music of all of the movies is beautiful, added to this one there is the beautiful song done by Billy Boyd (Pippin) while Faramir rides towards Osgiliath and Viggo Mortenson's (Aragorn) Elven poem/song at his crowning as king of Gondor. This soundtrack puts all others I've ever heard to shame. You'll be sorry if you don't get it."
5,"Ringer buys LOTR CD, what a surprise",Being the huge Lord of The Rings fan that I am (which has a name like Trekkie but cooler - Ringer) I of course bought this CD just like the two before it and as usual I was not disappointed. Howard Shore is one of the best movie soundtrack composers I know of and his music never falls flat. The music on this soundtrack is different from the first two movies since it gives the listener closure. We know this is the end and the music reflects that. Few movie soundtracks (and music in general) move me to tears and this one has done it for the third time. You listen to the music and remember the scenes from the movie with a bitter sweet sadness. Thank you Howard Shore for doing it again.
5,For The Most Part....An Original Score,"It is amazing to read some of the negative responses to Shore's amazing score for the Return of the King. They are pointing out that You are missing a few of the themes in the earliers LOTR Soundtracks. What some of these opinions are missing is the POINT. The greatness of a composer is the ability to use great themes in different ways. Shore has accomplished this task in a remarkable fashion in this last of the trilogy soundtracks. If people want to hear those themes that are missing from this last soundtrack, let them listen to the other two soundtracks to hear those themes. Kudos to Shore for writing a lot of original music that brings freshness to Tolkien's story."
5,LOVE,It arrived within a VERY reasonable amount of time. I LOVE this soundtrack! The CD was in very good shape.
5,One of the most powerful Scores ever,"I have the trilogy on dvd and have heard a lot of the scores online and in the movies and know that i need to buy this score. The only OST currently out that can hold any water closely would be either troy, or The Day after tomorrows."
3,Not TTT or FOTR,"Quite a disapointment. Although there are some memorable tracks, the whole score is weak compared with the TTT especially. The end credit song is also forgetable."
2,Don't get me wrong...,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the music. It's some of the most moving music ever composed for film. My beef is with this ""Limited Edition"" soundtrack, and that complaint is the ""limited"" part. Although the soundtrack for FotR suffered from cut-and-paste it at least managed to play in film order. This one felt like the editor chose the tracks and order by tossing a dart at a list of the different pieces. And here is also the biggest flaw: Two of the BEST musical cues from the film have been cut from this soundtrack: The chorale variation of the main Fellowship Theme from the Battle of the Morannon is gone entirety, as is most of the Charge of the Rohirrim.Maybe I'm being harsh, but just how much was left out, and the jumbled order, deeply disappointed me. I only hope that when the Extended Edition of Return of the King is released this entire 12+ hour symphony, in proper film order, follows it."
1,Not well made at all,I didn't mind having to put the laterns together but the fact that 4 of the poorly made brackets broke as I was trying to put it together was really annoying. Then one of the 3 strands I bought was a complete waste because the actual string of lights was broken - copper wire exposed - as soon as I took it out of the package. This was a huge disappointment.
1,Cheaply made and flimsy,"I'm not sure what I was thinking purchasing paper lanterns, but these are probably some of the worst outdoor patio lanterns I've ever had. First of all, it is difficult to assemble them and because you have to force the lanterns open with a metal bracket the paper gets easily ripped. Half of the brackets broke in half at the point where the metal frame is attached back to itself while I was assembling this.I had the lanterns strung outside when it started to rain. I quickly gathered them up and pulled them inside (they were maybe in the rain 5-10 minutes). The dye in the paper ran all over the place leaving a mess and some crappy looking lanterns once they dried. If you plan on using lanterns outdoors, these are poor choice due to the shoddy craftsmanship and total lack of durability."
2,Seahawks T Shirt,Overall not very pleased....white letters are fading after only a couple of months.
2,Didn't really explain anything,"I thought that she was going to explain to you how to invest in rental properties without going into deep debt for yourself. However, the truth is you need money to invest in real estate. So, there's really no way around it, which made her book redundant. She just gave examples of 3 people with 3 different investment strategies. In the end, the one with the most number of rental properties ended up with the largest profit growth. I really did not find the book useful for someone looking to invest in rental properties."
3,Good Premise... sadly underdeveloped.,"I really got into the premise of the begger child taken into the royal family. But Arn was a disappointment in that his sole ambition is to eat, sleep, and wench. His character had a lot of potential that was never developed. There was ALOT of combat detail that I am not a big fan of. However, the writing was interesting and comical at times. I am ordering the second of the series to see if Arn developes a personality. The relationship betweens brothers was sadly lukewarm. Maybe Arn will grow in the 2nd book???"
3,Not that good.,I found the guide to be incrediably lacking. It didn't even have a good walkthrough. Don't waste your money!
5,Brilliant,"This book was the funniest book of the year. True it did point out some serious issues, and at the same time revealed the humor in them. Kim, you go girl!"
3,Dangerous alien flowers,This is a entertaining story that will make you wonder about flowers and how they are thought to be just flowers! The story moves along nicely and is very believable. It will make you look at flowers differently and wonder if you should really be talking to them. It is a light sci fi/fantasy story and readers new to the sci fi genre will find it very readable. They may never look at new flowers in the same way again.
4,Bought this knowing nothing about it,It was absolutely bloody fantastic! Think Little Shop of Horror's meets the zombie apocalypse to get a feel of what this is like.
1,Do not purchase the Kindle version of this book,"As many others have noticed, the Kindle version of this book is corrupt and I'd encourage you to purchase another version of the book."
3,Only three stars for the Kindle edition,"This is a great classic work of science fiction; however, the Kindle edition doesn't do it justice. Besides not including the Introduction that's included in the paperback edition, the Kindle version is full of typos, missing letters, missing punctuation, and so on. Amazon needs to do a better job of quality control on the books it accepts for the Kindle."
4,Post-Apocalypse Now!,"Fantastic, frightening and entirely plausible, ""Day of the Triffids"" is a post-apocalyptic story based on a simple hypothesis - mass blindness coupled with the natural disaster of a mobile stinging plant called the triffid created by genetic engineering gone sour! Wyndham's genius is how he uses the tale of his still sighted protagonists, Bill Masen and Josella Playton, to address the moral and psychological issues that would be certain to raise their heads in this particular new world order - the definition of marriage, sexuality and the survival of the race, law and order, male vs female roles, government and authority, survival of the fittest and many more. Thought provoking in the extreme and yet still completely satisfying even when read only on the surface as a science-fiction thriller!Paul Weiss"
1,AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL,"This is the most god awful CD I have ever heard. I bought it, listened to it and threw it away. You may say that I could have given it to somebody else, but I don't think I would like anybody who would voluntarily listen to it. The lyrics are lame and nieve. The beat is garbled mush. HORRIFIC!!!!!!!"
1,AWFUL,This is awful. I ordered the book at August 5th. But still I HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE BOOK YET!!!!! It has been about a month since I ordered the book. I can't believe it took so many time.This is absurd.
2,Another Mindless TCM Clone...,"A pregnant woman (Raine Brown from 100 TEARS), her husband, and their four friends venture deep into the woods in order to be hacked, bludgeoned, and chainsawed to death by crazy hillbillies, including a masked, chainsaw-wielding maniac (zzzzz). If you are a fan of Ms. Brown , then I recommend sticking w/ the aforementioned 100 TEARS, as this movie is dull and not well realised. It's only slightly better than the godawful WOODS OF EVIL, also starring Brown. Yeeech!..."
4,Shows just how difficult it is to be truly Original....,"and here the Bad Plus almost succeedA Talented and above all, interesting, group5-Stars if they had only somehow managed to substitute another track for ""My Funny Valentine"" which is their only clunker ( ! )GW"
2,Basic info already known,"I was expecting a lot more out of this book. If you have been doing end of life care for a while, this book doesn't help at all. I am going to resell it."
3,Physics Book Bought Used,"First off I bought this text book (brand new) from a seller of used books. The seller, like some other sellers of used books, put the book in a cheap envelope. When the book arrived in the mail the envelope was torn on 3 of the 4 corners and the top of the book was slightly indented in a few areas.As for the text book itself after studying only the first 4 chapters it is obvious the authors are fans of relativity even though the text's material is supposed to be a calculus based introduction of mechanics. They do offer some challenging problems to solve. So far I found just one mistake, the wrong sign used in an example problem in chapter 4. Overall, comparing this book to the one used for previous classes of algebra based mechanics and electromagnatism (double book version) I would rate this text a C."
5,Superman and Batman--Best Buds,"The joy of reading World's Finest is in the interplay between a guy with superpowers and another guy whose skills are nearly super. This silver age treat in the D.C. roster shows us why friendship is always interesting. Some friendships were just meant to be--Superman really enjoys the company of Batman and the same is true for Batman towards Superman. In many ways, Superman and Batman are the most self-sufficient of heroes in the D.C. universe and their confidence in their abilities is what makes this partnership work. If you're ten years old, this on-going ""buddy"" adventure is a joy to behold. Who wouldn't want to partner up with the ""Man of Steel""? If Superman could be great pals with Batman, maybe he could be great pals with any one of us kids. If you're going outside to play, wouldn't you like to mess around with these two guys?Donald Gallinger is the author ofThe Master Planets"
4,Good value and versatility,"This size was a reluctant but necessary choice after two unsuccessful attempts to get the 14 x 19 size in 100 qty.The price was higher, but not that much. The pleasant surprise came when I realized how much more adaptable the larger size is for shipping a wide variety of items. For the smaller sizes, it's no problem to fold over the excess poly material and tape it down as an extra protective layer. It is flexible and easy to fit over large packages; works best with those that are relatively light weight. The poly material is lightweight and not highly resistant to piercing; serviceable for general packaging/shipping purposes."
5,Ahhhh...I love the Wire,"This season gets back to the good stuff with a focus on the Barksdale Organization and the Baltimore Police Department. It's a bit more complex than Season 1 in that it really dives deeper into the challenges faced by law enforcement and presents parallels between the law enforcement community and the street gangs. There is an order to this season that feels so good for such a transient moment, it's hard to explain. Overall, another great season."
5,Talk about realistic!,You won't find a more realistic cop drama on TV. After 3 episodes you'll be hooked in.
5,The Wire- season 3,"I received this item on the exact day promised. It perfect condition. Couldn't be more satisfied, especially since it is a Christmas gift. Will shop again."
4,Another excellent season...,This will be somewhat biased because I've been a huge fan of the series since the beginning. The Third season does not disappoint. All your favorite characters are back doing what they each do best. The two things about this series that I most enjoy are the grittiness of the script and setting and also the strength of each individual character. If you loved the first two seasons then this one is a must.
4,Christmas Present,I bought Seasons 2-4 for my dad for Christmas and he loved them. He immediately started watching them daily until he finished all of them.
5,Crossing the Threshold of Hope,"DEEEEEP. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A REALLY DEEP THEOLOGICAL BOOK, IN A SIMPLE, EASY TO READ FORMAT, LOOK NO FURTHER. THIS BOOK WAS A REAL EYE OPENER FOR ME. IT'S SO SIMPLE YET STIMULATES DEEP THOUGHTS ON GOD. THE POPES EXPLANATIONS ON GOD AND THE WORLD ARE SO INTERESTING, I REALLY LIKED THE INTERVIEW SETUP OF THIS BOOK, I WISH ALL FAITHS COULD BE EXPLAINED IN AN INTERVIEW TYPE FORMAT. THIS IS A MUST READ!"
4,well...,"Well, I started it, but I have yet to actually continue reading it. I'm interested in seeing what the late Pope has to say on a variety of subjects. On that note, I'm excited for the book. On the other hand, if he uses jargon that isn't just down to earth, that makes me wary. I like getting clear answers to questions I have, and I'm concerned about whether or not he'll be able to answer some of them. Either way, it's sure to be an interesting read."
3,Crossing the Threshold of Readability,"This book I really thought was going to be a more didactical piece, but I found it to contain quite a few pieces of rethoric. It had many bright spots, but many parts contain endless quotes from encyclicals and past conciliums such as Vatican II and one in Latin. At least for the tape version this quoting business is not such a great idea. About the basic tenets of christianity, obviously John Paul II is right on the spot about the basic beliefs and when he expresses his own opinions it is interesting."
4,The Pope Digressing on a Range of Church & Worldly Subjects,"A book with the Pope JPII talking and thinking about the Church and its mission.Done in a style of a submitted written question by the interviewer, followed by a written response by JPII.Some topics and some chapters would go over the heads of most, especially the one about philosophy and the players(prominent philosophers).However, most of the book is accessible or comprehensible to the general reader.A nothing special book, not a must read.But if you want to know JPII better in his role as Pope this is a good start."
2,crossing the threshold of hope,"Although I think John Paul II to be one of the greatest leaders the world has seen, this writing is above the comprehension of the average person, including me.Bill Dowling"
3,Interesting read,"We are reading this for my church book group. It has fostered a lot of conversation. I had no idea it was the Pope's response to a series of questions. Both the questions and answers are interesting, although Pope Benedict often never really addresses the exact question, which can be a little frustrating."
1,The Phantom of the Opera,"I viewed three versions(1925, 1962 and 2004) of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and enjoyed the ones made in 1962 and in 2004. I love the story of the 1962 version;the phantom is proved to be a respected music professor, a victim also a hero(by saving Christine's life) and people find out who is the actual ""monster"". Its stage is taken place in London Opera House instead of Paris."
1,Ugh.....,"I do not recommed this at all for someone who wants some truth to the story line. It's a good movie, in the Hammer House style. But, as a Phantom movie, it's just horrible. The only good part in the movie is where the phantom is playing Bachs Toccata and Fuge in D minor on the organ. Of all the phantom movies I've seen, that's one of the best senes. But, over all it was a terrible movie."
2,Definitely not the best phantom movie I've seen.,"I have seen MANY versions of phantom & this is by far my least favorite. The singing is only ok, and while the acting is not the worst I've seen it certainly was not by any means good acting. Had I known or seen this movie before I would not have bought it. Save your money."
5,A haunting thriller in the classic mode.,"Herbert Lom stars as the unfortunate Prof. Pertwee whose beautiful music is stolen by the unscrupulous Michael Gough -Lord Ambrose d'Arcy. The professor is grotesquesly burned in an effort to destroy the music that d'Arcy has put his name to. When d'Arcy tries to put on the Professor's Opera The Joan of Arc> The Phantom (Lom)bedevils the opera house with tragedies and accidents by use of his friend ""the Dwarf"". But the Phantom now discovers Christine, His new star,she is the Phantom's one weakness and he teaches her how to sing his opera, and pays the ultimate price to keep her alive. GET this OPERA on film Hammer does the Ultimate justice to the story. This is a MUST SEE!!!"
3,ONE SONG ONLY,"THe album has one great song on it and for the cheap price it is kinda worth it.OF COURSE THAT SONG IS ""MAJOR TOM"".One of the best 80's songs out there. Sadly the song is never on any of those darn 80's cd's."
5,Understanding Painting-Tonal Values,Add this excellent guide to seeing to Painting on Location and you will have the best tools possible for learning not just how to paint but how to see. With the very interesting experiments this video introduces re: how we see you will have guide lines that will help you transform these visual experiences into interesting artworks.
1,disappointing,"I was expecting a lot more than this little book offered, especially in terms of grammar, which the author treats very lightly in spite of the title. The book focuses on punctuation and is not reader friendly at all. I recommend The Grammar Detective."
4,Grammatically Correct,"This product will be of assistance to anyone who is writing articles,books or even just business letters. It has been a great help to me."
5,Beneficial,"It has been some time since I've exercised my brain cells to form grammatically correct sentences on paper. I found this book extremely helpful in refreshing my mind to the ""basics"" of grammar. Ms. Stilman provided enough examples for even those who are slow witted (like myself) can understand. Her style is simple and straightforward without making you feel like an idiot. I highly encourage those who are looking for an easy way in understanding grammar (rules even the average person forgets at times) to buy this book. In fact, it helped me in writing this review."
4,Great Camping Headlamp,"Really perfect for backpacking and camping. The other models by the same manufacturer are all good, but this one has the benefit of the slider switch.This is important because the other models force you to toggle through all the various lighting modes every time you want to switch between red and white, or turn it off. That's very annoying...means you have to click the switch 4 times just to turn the stupid thing off. The good news is, THIS MODEL does not have that - simply switch to red, or switch to white light. Easy.The red light is ESSENTIAL for camping scenarios. Don't blind your buddies. Don't blind yourself. Easier to transition from firelight to tasks.Strap is adjustable, angle is adjustable. It's cheap. It's rugged. It doubles as an improptu bike safety light. It may not be as slick as more expensive brands, but it's better if the other brand doesn't have the aforementioned qualities."
4,kids loved the red option,"I purchased 8 at LLBean; when they ran out, I scrambled for 2 more from anywhere and got them from you. Yours were the only ones with a red light and tilt down option. Also yours were cheaper by a few dollars. Fabulous!!. Only negative is that there was no "" 5 year warranty"" that LLBean has on their products. Yours did not have a flash option, but I must tell you that the kids all wanted that red light option. Thanks"
5,A Must have,"Great headlamp. Highly recommended. The light direction is adjustable, the light is powerful, and the battery life is long. The strap around my head is of good quality, after a couple of minutes I don't feel it anymore.Only criticism: I don't find the red light mode too useful, though, as it is very faint, therefore it can be used only indoors."
3,Disappointing,"I was very excited to read a book about orthodox Jewish life in Israel. What fascinates me is the way of life and in that I was not disappointed. The characters, however, were wooden, the plot cloying and it seemed to go nowhere. The big question was how the couple would get together (and you knew they would), so it seemed rather sophomoric. I like to revel in the style of the author, and found the style plodding. My hopes for something better on the next page were disappointed too many times so I gave up half-way through."
5,GO STEELERS!,This is a must have for any true DIE HARD STEELER FAN! One for the thumb is not in our vocabulary anymore because of this season.
1,not such nice quality,"this shirt looks like i,ve made it myself.very simple printing and the quality of the shirt is not so nice either."
5,Excellent indie horror film,"I enjoyed this film. It was a slow-burn horror film. I thought the acting was incredible. The camera-work was well done and the lighting was good. The story was troubling and dark. I watched this film in anticipation of the next scene throughout the film. Yes, it was predictable but honestly, what horror film isn't these days? The story was a bit of a retelling of May and Misery, but enough differed to make it worth watching. For those who like their films full of zombies, werewolves, or fast-moving slashers with high body counts, this film will bore you. But if you like variety in your horror you'll find this cerebral film different and much more enjoyable than any of the remakes and reimaginings done on budgets far greater than Nobody Loves Alice."
2,Too much Baywatch and not enough noir,"This is a stylish production with fantastic sets, stunning scenery, and some decent acting, especially by Morgan Freeman. The dialogue that sounded like classic Elmore Leonard was taut and witty, but seemed out of context. Ms. Foster has a hot figure, but her character is more valley girl than sultry temptress. And while I love Owen Wilson's perennially sunny personality and the fact that he makes such an unlikely con artist, he doesn't bring any cynicism or complexity to this role. Even his most cold and calculating lines are delivered in a characteristically laid-back and friendly tone of voice. This flic is billed as a film noir, but it seems like all the noir got laundered out in the gorgeous turquoise surf."
1,Product Placement,The only enjoyment I got from this movie was counting the number of product placements!!!They even have a product placement individual listed in the credits.
1,Stinks despite big cast,"How can a movie with Morgan Freeman, Charlie Sheen and Owen Wilson go so wrong? It's even based on an Elmore Leonard novel, whose stuff is good. But there have been more than a few stiff Leonard adaptations, and this is one of them. Wilson is never believable as a semi-bad guy, the script is weak, and the' comedy,' such as it is, is not funny. The only good thing is the Hawaiian scenery. Take a pass on this one."
2,It'll pass the time,"Is Big Bounce great? NoIs it horrible? NoIs it funny? NoIs it entertaining? YeahFreeman has done much better, but the scenary is awesome and Foster is hot. Sheen looks like Matt Dylan for Something About Mary.Big Bounce is alright to spend 88 minutes of your life. Don't expect great and leave your brain at the door."
4,"Visionary, Artistic, A rising star in Patrick Gleason!",One of the most original vampire stories of recentyears. A moody low budget film set sometime in the future. Patrick Gleason is a director to watch.
3,Stopping air flow out of my house.,"This stripping was easy to install and it works fairly well, but it could be a little thicker as there is still a gap between the door and the frame on a 18-inch section of the door way. The old, split weather stripping was a little more heavier in width. I wish they made different strengths in the magnetic strip."
2,Disappointenly non-entertaining,"This new work is surprisingly short on substance or entertainment. Buffett's previous works have been great at balancing a fun story with some deeper meaning. This book can be summed up in a few sentences. Got allot of money, love to fly, love to fish, go ahead and live vicariously through me. This is not what Buffett's music has been about, although if you listen to Banana Wind, you knew a book like this was coming. Spend you money on his other books, well worth it, and skip this one."
3,Read when you REALLY have nothing else to do.,"I've read all of Jimmy's books and I have all of Jimmy's music. This book does not live up to the Legend I was expecting to read about. I didn't find any true insight about turning 50 nor did I learn much about why Jimmy is where he is now. I do believe he has become a money making machine - contrary to his earlier - ""I know this may sound funny, but money don't mean nothing to me. I don't make my music for money...I make my music for me."" (From the A1A cd) Like other readers, I was easily distracted and only read when I really had nothing else to do. But if you love the man, you gotta read the book. There were some good parts and some not so good - well downright boring parts. All said he is still the Leader of the ParrotHeads and I'm still a believer."
4,Once again Buffett touches the sand in our souls,"For those of us who have been fortunate enough to live at least a piece of our dreams (except for the ones of course that would have us a making a living by them), Buffett has once again captured the soul of the Caribbean, of fly-fishing and of taking off into the less chartered regions that were the birthplace of the Americas and the playgrounds of our learning."
3,just a fun read,"sometimes bogs down if you're not an airplane nut, but a lot of fun to read when you skip those parts."
3,Well It is essentially a man's book,"Jimmy Buffett thinks a lot of himself and he is not afraid if we know it. I bought the book because i am entertained by his music and have day dreams of traveling around the Caribbean.Fly fishing is not my thing it's my husband's. Nor am I interested in the fine points of flying.As an early childhood educator, I was somewhat surprised that he would meet some strangers on an island and decide they were okay to babysit for him. Not entirely smart for a well known american abroad but it's only my opinion.Throughout I found it mildly entertaining in a peter pan sort of way."
5,Living Vicariously Through Mr. Buffett,"I'd heard from friends that the book was slow, if you didn't like fly fishing. But traveling the Carribean and South America with Jimmy made me want to know more about geography, the Amazon, the people, the culture of the Carribean and the way of the Island people. To go where he has gone, see what he has seen, and taste life through unjaded and 'youthful at 50' lips is a dream of this southern bred girl. I embrace 40 as much as he did 50, with the hunger and zest to see what is beyond the border of the mundane life most of us are born to lead. He, like Hemingway, never forgets to describe the essence of the normalcy, and make it intriguing. I hated for his trip to end, as it seemed as if I were along for the ride. And what a ride it was! I wonder what he's got planned for 60?"
3,Pirate looks at fifty,It was a fairly good book but not as good as his other novels. Some of the stories were not that interesting and I'm not a big fan of journals. It did provide some insights into the pirate.
2,The drum has quit kicking,Track down all scares about damp spider infested corners of the world with the cool ol' island boy but wipe your tracks. Ah stow the bear gun in the old streamboot just don't chew up the scenery. The good master jedi warrior should be folding the map and stay on land and stretch his imagination with a pina colada. The glory days strewn in or sewn from his diaries are like the stickers anyway. The niche is a skein of fruit wine to his people.
3,Way Too Long,"This book was part travelogue and part autobiography. It's too thin on humor and the travel notes were too long-winded and in most places uninteresting. Buffet was a bit of a loafer, albeit an intelligent and talented musician and song writer. A shorter version of 250 pages would've been better, and I'm fairly certain some of his more interesting adventures have been omitted. Is that the price of writing today as a more mature and family oriented individual? You can love his music at any age, but perhaps you've got to be 50 to fully understand the pace and course of his narrative."
2,Interesting and funny -- bad attitude,"I know that his fans will love him for ever... I know that he created a culture where there was none... However, as interesting as his life seems to be, he does not need to rub our noses in how much better he is than we are....Book is readable, entertaining, good for the summer. His attitude... my friend, take another vacation but this time make an attitude adjustment."
2,Uhhh...OK.,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. What an ego ride he was on. Parrotking or not, you don't talk down to the people you are trying to reach out to, to sell your products. Actually, the only reason I'm writing this is because I noticed a few editorial mistakesm (making me think the book was rushed as well) and Buffett seems to contradict stories and liner notes from his albums and other writings. It was an OK read but I guess TRUE Parrotheads will not find any fault in ther self-worshipping idol (reason fans are named after FANATICS). Form your own opinion, not just because you like the guys music."
1,I must be missing something....,"Looking over the other reviews, many with 5 stars, I must be missing something. I like Buffett's music, and impulsively picked up the book with the Albatross on the cover since I'm a pilot and would love to fly the Caribbean. I guess I expected more of an adventure story about flying throughout the area, which really didn't start until well into the book. I was looking forward to the author making me feel like I was in the right seat with him while making water landings in exotic ports of call. Alas, the reading was more like watching someone's home movies. Unfortunately one of the most boring I've read."
1,american cinema orchestra = synthesizer,"A decent compilation of film music, but the American Cinema Orchestra consists of a guy/girl and his/her synthesizers...."
4,very comfortable,I've been wearing Olga underwear for many years. These were a nice discovery. I like the wide lace band just below the waist. There are no lines under my clothing.
3,"A Consummate Work for the Genre, Yet not my Favorite","The ideas in this book gave birth to the enjoyable Steampunk genre of books and maybe even comics, cartoons, and the the odd Broadway musical set. This book was a fun read, but contained too much of the fantasy elements in the wrong places for my tastes. Granted, this genre is not founded on a tremendous amount of reality, but rooted in enough to make it about ""what if."" At least, that's the type of story I tend to enjoy more. I found the exposition passages in Infernal Devices to be entirely fantastical and almost made me stop reading (whereas, I eat up the exposition passages in a story like The Lord of the Rings).However, the dialog is absolutely masterful and heightened by the play between the modern (or at least 60's -ish) lingo and the Victorian. Overall the story was very enjoyable and I'm glad I read it, but I'm also glad I'm done with it. I am eying Jeter's other works for reading in the near future."
4,Good stuff,"Though this is not the funniest movie that has been put out there recently, it falls short only by a little bit. In general, the movie is a nice glance back at an old TV show and pokes fun of the 70's often. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are establishing themselves as two of the funniest guys on film these days and they tried hard to make this another comic success.There are a bunch of crazy characters in this movie and some of the casting such as Snoop and Will Farrel was brilliant. There is a nice balance between different styles of humor and a few fun action scenes as well. Overall, a very solid comedy that is suitable for any collection."
3,an average comedy,"This is an entertaining and unpretentious movie. I guess it has to be seen like a comedy and not like a remake. I wasn't a big fan of the original show but i can understand that the purists are disappointed. According to me, its an ""ok"" movie, nothing more, nothing less!"
4,Great onscreen chemistry,"This movie may not be as comical as most expect it to be but the overall feel of the movie is great. Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller have great onscreen chemistry. They just bounce lines off each other and take care of each other as if they were brothers. The only part I didn't enjoy was the camio by the original Startsky and Hutch. It seemed to not fit well with the whole rest of the movie. They shouldn't have had them be their own charaters-maybe just appeared as some random people-like a vendor or something. But other than that the actors were great, the music is wonderful, and the direction was good."
2,Miniscule Saving Graces,"This was supposed to be a humorous movie, but it was more dumb than funny. I always like Ben Stiller, but this movie doesn't show him off as well as Meet The Parents. The black lady's rendition of that Captain & Tennille song can only be called sacreligious. I guess one could call it a fun/upbeat movie, but it is **not** funny. The only two things keeping this off the worst possible rating are Carmen Electra and Juliette Lewis. Juliette blazes my world white-hot, but she is not in many movies anymore for some reason. The other cheerleader [besides Carmen] is also a babe. There was one minor breast cleavage outline from behind, but I guess they were trying to keep the rating not so harsh, so as to draw a more mainstream audience. This can be summed up easily by saying:wait for rental."
4,Funny Movie,"I bought this movie today. I've never seen the TV show before I don't think. The movie is very funny, I love Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. There are other great actors who are in the movie as well. Last but not least the band that was featured in the movie Old School ""The Dan Band"" play in the movie."
2,Enough is enough,"Again, another interesting pop-corn director that makes a couple of good low budget films and when Hollywood gives to him a free hand (or not so much) things go wrong. Is not funny, Wilson and Stiller aren't interesting enough and the 70's isn't a good decade to crave for. With this kind of films, is useful to listen to American critics, they know more about their own culture than us."
1,Still waiting for a laugh,"Going into this movie, I wasnt expecting much. And I was right after only finsihing it half way through the movie. I tried to laugh, really I did, but when I was laughing, I was laughing at how bad the humor was. Ben Stiller just didnt work the part for me. Seemed like he was trying to hard. Owen Wilson didnt work the part for me either. And I wasnt buying Vince Vaughn as the bad guy either. Snoop Dogg was pretty funny though, but the movie just didnt do anything for me. GO rent DODGEBALL instead."
5,Awesome..,This is such an amazing DVD; I have the book but the movie really gives you a pictorial which is good for learning. The Secret is not to be watch like any other movies you watch for entrainment; it is to be played over and over again until it sticks and you are actually doing what it says to do. If you are ready to change your life around get the DVD and the book or CD.
5,The Power Of Positive Thinking,"This is a great DVD. I highly recommend it for people who need inspiration and motivation in their lives. The secret tells you how to use the power of positive thinking in your daily life, and gives you true story examples of how other people have benefited by doing so.If you know of anyone going through hard or difficult times (financially, health wise, relationship wise), this would be a great gift to give.Anyone who says the power of positive thinking is not possible in the real world; has not tried it on a regular basis. If you apply the principles of this DVD to you life, things can and will change for the better. All you have to do is believe in yourself and have a positive mindset in everything that you do.Well worth the time and money...."
2,Doesn't compare to What the Bleep...,"Though the underlying message is the same (positive attracts positive, etc), this feels like a cheesy infomercial rather than an intriging metaphysical exploration like What the Bleep. It was recommended to me as the ""sequel"" that ""really explains it all."" I was really disappointed in the superficial and unsophisticated message presented here and recommend it only to those who stay up late looking for answers from paid TV shows."
3,"Not real exciting, author make their imagined $$$$ with this",Rather boring movie. Hard to watch. I cannot say I think it will work. OVERPRICED for what you get... OVERGLAMORIZED....
3,what secret?,"I have studied every,philosphy in print and hardly see what the hub bub is with this topic.if you have been around the philosphy block save your money."
2,It's nothing new,"The acting in this DVD is terrible and starling noisy at times. It's nothing new, there is really no measureable results. Positive thinking is good, but asking the universe for what you desire and getting it is questionable."
3,Not earth shaking...,"I watched the entire DVD and found it redundant and overly dramatized. I'd like to see the same concept and information in a different presentation. Many friends were extremely enthusiastic, but it became ""Well, yeah ..."" for me. Someone who is seeking universal principles and understanding, someone who has never encountered these ideas will be hopefully impressed and moved. It is along the lines of the DVD ""What the Bleep Do We Know"" which I found much better and highly recommend."
4,Be the Master of Your Destiny,It is a great philosophical insight into the journey of our lives and how to steer it to achieve success and fulfillment.
1,LOL,"I looked at a copy, and a few minutes were enough to know that this is recycled drivel, nothing new except a slick presentation.I had an acquaintance really into the ""laws of attraction"". Born into a wealthy family, and could not understand other's money woes. We were riding In my car one day, and when it over-heated I was asked ""why did you create this?"" We were in my Acquan's car a few weeks later, and a tire blew. Again, my pal asked the same question: ""why did you create this?"". ""Just to annoy you"" was evidently not an appropriate response.I wonder how likely the 5-star reviewers are to be regular lottery ticket buyers, and why we never read about psychics (or 'authors' like these) winning powerball.I'm all for ""positive thinking"", and figure that we can find a connection between ""an attitude of gratitude"" and lower stress levels, but you'll feel better about yourself if you use the money this costs to donate to a reputable relief agency."
2,So what else is new?,"The title is a marketing ploy.Simply wishing and performinga thought-circus, will not getwhat you ""deserve"".There is some truth to good/badthoughts, and their circuitousness;but without benefit to your fellowman, your comfort levels are goingnowhere."
1,"watered-down, superficial drivel","I had heard all the hype about this dvd, and luckily, I didn't buy it but borrowed it from a friend. I agree with other reviewers that this ""secret"" is no secret, but borrowed from Emmett Fox and many others, but WITHOUT the spiritual component. Whatever happened to serving others and its rewards? All I can think of us the starving children in Africa and the genocide in Darfur, and IF ONLY the recipients of such atrocities knew ""the secret"", they too would prosper, and not be in such a predicament.The really sad thing is the shallow, self-centeredness of applying the law of attraction....cars, houses, a lot of money. I'm sad Oprah was sold this bill of goods and promoted it onto the masses. Please don't bother watching this nonsense."
4,Just get the audiobook,"There really wasn't a need to make this into a DVD. You can listen to the audiobook in your car or something. It is a good message about positive thinking, but it does not address the issue for those who have a problem with positive thinking."
3,Power of Positive Thinking repackaged,"I thought this was quite good, not because it presented a new idea, but because it was explained in a ""new""? way. The scientific viewpoint of all of us being basically just ""energy"" is attractive to some who might be turned off by the standard idea of an inner ""spirit"". I did not like such emphasis on the ""Secret"" being used to get material things that was a focus for most of the discussion."
5,Need a clue? Get The Secret!,"The Secret is, if you are in the right frame of mind, the answer to questions you've harbored for years - how do I change my life? How can I become more of who I am? How can I create a better life? It requires an open mind and the ability to IMAGINE change. It also requires faith in your own ability to create the life you desire through positive imagery. Sceptics won't appreciate the message in The Secret, but for the rest of the world, it can bring about change. Try it!"
5,Great video,THIS DVD CHANGE MY LIFE AND I'M SURE YOU WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU SEE IT! ALSO WILL CHANGE THE LIFE OF ALL YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS.
5,Totally Awesome!,This should be required viewing in every school in the country! What a surge in creativity and abundance whould happen after everyone seeing this!
3,Grey magick for dummies,Dangerous booklet. Magick is not for everybody especially if you don't understand what you are doing.
3,The Secret,"Condition was excellent. The idea of building the person's confidence is also excellent. I think there may be some issue with the Higher Being portion. I think I allowed myself to imagine it was my higher being when I watched it. So, I hope other's will allow the same."
5,life-changing,Someone told us about the Secret. We got the book and movie and quit thinking in less and thought about more. It worked and we have a lot more joy and abundance. You flow better and see your future easier. I recommend it.
3,"Warning about The ""Secret""","I have not read the book but i saw the dvd. There is a good message in there... but, over all, it focuses WAY too much on how to use spirituality to manipulate the forms. For people who are not already spiritual seekers....it will be completely mis-understood, mis-used...and could potentially drive a person crazy with grief. Especially when applied to tragic events in one's life. It's not your fault!!!! For damage control...I recomend The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle.....because it's a book goes much deeper. Peace and Love to ALL!!!!"
5,The Secret,"I thought this video was very interesting, and it reminded me of how important it is to watch our thoughts. I have heard of the universal energy several times throughout my life and how it makes up all things and surrounds us. Realising that our thoughts too are energy, and attract things and people into our lives (the law of attraction) is very important to remember. This video drives that home over and over again and makes you realise that most people think of the things that they don't want, and that they are worried about constantly and therefore attract these things over and over again. I have watched this video several times because I know it will take me some time to break the habit of negative thinking."
3,Not a movie,"I thought this was going to be more of a movie the way the previews were presented, but it wasnt. It was more of a documentary. I bought it used, glad not to have spent full retail price on it. Very interesting and informative despite not being in movie format."
4,Good Movie,"Good Video. It does not go into enough detail and then to find out that they cheated Esther and Jerry Hicks out of the film, when they were the major source of information that was left out."
1,Crap!!!,"""The Secret"" is truly a joke. The insentive is beautiful, but execution and the way it is presented is not based on increasing the value of life, but to make more money!! New age crap !!!"
1,If the law of attraction...,"Let me start this review out by saying if the law of attraction was real every straight guy in the world would be dating a supermodel. The beginning of the video states that ""Bob the gay guy"" was being harassed and assaulted because he was attracting violently anti-homosexual people to himself by the things he was mentally focused on. Think about that... If we reason a bit and apply that same line of logic, then when a woman gets raped the line of reasoning in the video implies it would be her fault for attracting this behavior to her. If someone gets murdered was it because they attracted the murderer? Really? That's your theory on life, the universe and everything? To blame the victim? Really?Last Edited ~ 05/29/2012"
1,Simple fact,"I have no desire to write a long diatribe about this work or any of it's related companion pieces, but I would like to stress one point to anyone who is looking to this ""philosophy"" for answers: there is not one shred of substantiated evidence for any of the principles, techniques, or guidelines in this book. It purports a good deal of ""scientific"" basis for what it's saying, but the fact is, it's all just opinion. No experiments, no tests, nothing, just an idea of how things ""could"" work without any basis or foundation. If that's the kind of thing you want to live your life by, then be my guest, but just know that you are essentially believing a fairy tale."
2,Ok,"This was a great movie, everyone should see it. However the particular seller I bought from misrepresented the quality of the product. The DVD worked fine, however the cover was very beat up and worn. The seller described it as being in ""like new"" condition"". It definitely wasn't. So thumbs up to the movie, thumbs down to the seller."
5,The Secret,The DVD was all I expected it to be .I really liked the life -living examples it provided. This is a DVD that can be watched over and over.
4,Amazing to contemplate!,"I would really enjoy living in a home, working in a place, attending a church and living in a community where people thought more about what makes them happy and satisfied than what makes them grumpy, mean spirited and unpleasant to be around! ... not to mention how enlightening it is for people to realize they have a part in the way there lives are currently (accepting personal responsibility). My way of thinking has definitely been altered. Loving it!"
4,Good with action,"The teaching of positive thinking is great. To have positive thoughts is healthy for the mind, body, and soul. I think this DVD is uplifting, insightful, and inspirational. I wished they talked more about the physical actions of a positive mind and how that can benefit not only that person but everyone around them."
5,Revolutionary!,"Are you looking for health, wealth and happines? Well, the Secret is in this DVD. It's the law of attraction, which says we create our own world. All the great thinkers knew the Secret and that was the key to thir success. This knowledge is being released to the masses because the time is right. We have come to a time in our evolutionary history to make a quantum jump in our consciousness levels.Some of today's great thinkers, success coaches, quantum physicists and metaphysicians provide tips on how to use the Secret to help you get what you want. No matter what you believe, the Secret can fit within your spiritual doctrine and help you understand more of life's unanswered questions."
5,A must,This is a great first step in your journey to self discovery and growth. I have loaned this to several people and have been given a great base for growth.
4,The Secret is no longer a secret,I've enjoyed this book. I've been able to pick it up and reread sections whenever I need to refresh my outlook.
3,Great Product & Service,"This dvd was exactly what I wanted. At first I had trouble playing the dvd because I was attempting to view it on a video game system. When I contacted the seller they were very quick to send out another disk at no additional charge. I then borrowed a dvd player from a neighbor and both disk played well. I gave one dvd to a relative that is interested in what is taught in this dvd, and kept the other to watch over and over again. This is the perfect gift for anyone that has a desire to be released from all of the negative and adverse thought patterns foisted upon us over the years. My life experiences have improved greatly as a result of putting what I have learned from ""The Secret"" into practice.Thank YouThe pleasure has been all mine."
1,The Secret,"I got a notice by email that my money was being returned to my account that I had paid for the DVD. There was no ""reason"" given for the return of my money nor ""why"" I wasn't sent The Secret DVD."
3,The Secret,"Hopeful, inspiring compilation of world perspectives on the interaction of the universe within individual lives; however, the format too fast paced for some people to understand the concepts....requires introspection even though the DVD can be watched repeatedly."
2,it was no secret,"it was no secret that my grass needed to be cut....so i stared out the window and focused really hard and bam a flash of white light... i looked and the grass was still long, the white light was just the hotaz sun..so i put on my boots and took action and now it is cut....take this book as it is, just some great material to help you change your mindset on how to look at things, but don't give the homeless man a dollar who stands next to the gas station with a beer in hand. take action.you will be rewarded, they are not always monetary rewards."
1,What a waste of time,"I received this DVD as a gift. It is filled with obvious information regarding the power of positive thought. If anything, I found it be completely depressing; it is sad that people are so desperate for something to help them turn their lives around that they will spend their hard-earned money making someone else rich, buying only common sense. Perhaps this DVD is helpful to people who feel completely powerless in their lives. Perhaps the ""inspirational"" stories give them hope. Cheers to them, but I definitely do not recommend this DVD unless you are a self-help guru."
1,Very harmful for all,"It was a marketing project designed to see how gullible people are. Call something a ""secret"" and see if they'll buy it. The truth is people are desperate. Its message is to tell people greed is okay and hope they ignore that greed is behind every horror in human civilization. Frightening and sad."
5,"With an open mind, this can change your life","The bottom line is that the Secret is about your mind set, so without an open mind, you cannot receive what they are trying to tell you, nor can you expect to reap the benefits of what life has in store for you. The Secret invites you to change your way of thinking. It invites you to implement the positive changes you want in your life. If you want unhappiness, you invite unhappiness; if you want a happy, prosperous life, you invite that too. It's all about mind set. I found that viewing the tape several times to be inspirational, and this has truly changed my life. I stepped out on faith and went into my law practice on my own. I not only am still in business, (when everyone predicted failure), but it is prosperous and blessed. Because I said it would be so and implemented my mind set to that goal. I highly recommend this DVD or book."
4,Remake of old info....but,"This film re-hashes facts made real for me by books such as Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. However, the film in particular makes what could be dry material very rich by using very successful people and by rapid-fire editing to put together all the info on how you produce EVERYTHING in your life by your thoughts and feelings. The professional presentation coupled with the excellent visuals and rapid movement from speaker to speaker is what makes the film eminently watchable (and rewatchable) and therefore makes it the effective message sender it is intended to be. Highly recommended, even for veteran 'life-creators'. It is a celebration of the power of humanity!"
3,OK,"Initially, I was inspired by the book so I bought the DVD. The DVD is more concerned with getting material things, so i didn't enjoy it as much. The book had more insight into more spiritual and emotional desires. However, I don't feel either really explained how to proceed on a day to day basis other than ""putting up a picture"" or ""acting as if you had it"". I feel I must be missing something!!!???"
4,the secret,"For a last minute gift I decided to purchase The Secret Extended Edition. However, I did not receive the extended edition BUT I did get it in time to be wrapped for Christmas morning so I didnt mind."
2,Fluff..,"Started out strong and went nowhere...it's the law of attraction, over and over and over - check out Live Like A Fruit Fly - also on amazon"
4,Inspirational and life-changing,"The first few minutes of the DVD could have been deleted, and I would have given this a 5 star. Quite boring in the beginning--almost like a sci-fi movie, but it became much more interesting after the prologue. Great motivational speakers and good use of descriptive scenarios. I bought several DVDs and I give them to friends as gifts. They too have been inspired by the law of attraction."
1,"Or ""How to get secretly ripped off""",It never fails to amaze me how gullible people can be.No wonder the Nigerian scams continue as long as you have gullible people like this around.
2,Hard to find where the actual video begins...it is okay once you get in....the book is better,It is very hard to find where you actually start viewing the video....I think the book is better.
1,Populist Capitalistic Bait for Incompetent Fishes,"My friends and I trade documentaries, and yesterday this excrement floated in.It is hard for me to find the words to describe the tragedy that is this production.The real secret is there is a sucker born every minute, and its no secret, anymore than anything in this overrated infomercial.Utter common advice, rephrased and packaged as some sort of mystical secret, along with the utmost simple-minded populist message imaginable: everything you could ever want, free...and of course without effort.And what would simpletons want, if they had command of the entire universe, which supposedly they do? Why a new car, of course...and a dream house...and lots and lots of money.And there are lots of pictures of money, and expensive cars, and million dollar homes.Surprise! There in the DVD case, additional merchandise just for you... to enable that new car, dream house, and lots and lots of money...for the producers of this raw sewage."
3,The Secret - more than needed,"Although the concept is something that is not new to me, I thought the idea of the young child wishing for the bike was a bit too much. Of course if a child wishes for something grandpa would know about it and eventually buy the child his bike. It was a bit too much and a tad hokey.I try to live my life in a positive light and the secret is something that I have tried to practice over the years. The concept to me is real and understandable. As for the DVD I would say most women know about this 6th sense and it is a lucky man who is also able to tap into this force. Overall it isn't a bad DVD, just a bit over done at times."
4,The Secret,"A great substitute for reading the book. I felt like the DVD was in-depth and answered my questions about ""The Secret."" It is religiously inclusive and reminds you to keep a postive outlook on life."
2,The Secret,There is no reason to publish. It is a lot of nonsence. Was money thrown away. You shoul stop selling this item
4,The Secret,"It's a Great information for those who are committed and really know what they want and can apply this knowledge that by the way there is not secret about the secret it's been out there and we don't see it. Make your own conclutions, but about the movie, well it is nice to watch it"
1,Stomach turning. I could only stand the first ten minutes.,"I don't mean to be unfair, but within ten minutes I had to stop the movie. One star for a basically positive message, under a heap of junk. They talk about how being poor or rich is a function of your thinking. I found that overgeneralization really stomach turning. What about all the thousands of years of bloody struggle for equality? It's ongoing, and a good deal of it is more involved than self-absorbed positive thinking. I'd been hoping it was just another inspiring self-help film, to get me out of the rut of my week, but instead it became a nightmare of outlandish and offensive generalizations. Maybe if I'd been able to get past the ridiculousness I could have enjoyed it. I'll never know."
1,This is a joke.,"I know some people enjoy this, but this is not for realists. I can't say how ridiculous I thought this was."
1,Horrible,This is awful. This type of a perspective on the universe would only be so popular in a White American materialistic culture. The implications of this thinking are so vast and selfish that i cannot even begin to unpack them in my review. Do you not think that children around the world think about food all day as their bellies swell and hair tinges orange? Stop thinking so much about how you can get yours and reach out your hand to someone else.
2,secrete ? not really - scam ? perhaps,"This is just a series of rah-rah head shots telling you to think positively. The music was nice though. LOL The ""extended"" part is worthless and not very entertaining too boot. We bought it because of the hype on Oprah. I am not very impressed, especially for the cost. I would rather have my $30. Someone is making a ton of money off of a very easily made CD."
4,The Secret (Extended Edition),"I have watched ""The Secret"" 5 times so far. Each time I watch it I understand more. If I had the money I would send a copy to all my family and friends. It is very positive."
5,My first DVD of this type.,"Before I bought this DVD, I only read books with this type of information.I think this DVD is helping me, but I don't feel the need to buy the companion book."
1,Visualize this,"Qoutes from the secret:""If you don't understand [the law of attraction] that doesn't mean you should reject it. You don't understand electricity, probably. First of all, no one even knows what electricity is...Do you know how it works? I don't know how it works, but I do know this: you can cook a man's dinner with it, and you can also cook the man.""People PAID to hear these assinine ramblings? I weep for the future.""I don't care what city you live in, you've got enough energy in your body to power it for a week."" Um... no."
1,Overrated,"I can not understand the recent reaction to this so called ""secret"" except to applaud their marketing. It is simply the power of positive thinking - Science of the Mind - Ernest Holmes - reincarnated. Get this tape only if you have a hour to spend hearing the same thing repeated over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over............."
1,Top Notch Swindlering.,"Notice the promotional expertise of the dvd, the media hype that surrounded it...and on top of all of that, most of the reviews you'll see here are, as well to no surprise, promoters of the DVD. Pay keen attention to similarities most of the 5-stare reviews share in their name titels, quote unquote ""Metaphysical specialists"" etc. Something for example that would make me believe a positive review was genuine would be if the reveiwer's title was something less impressive like ""video game player"", ""postal man"" and definitely not ""Professor of Metaphysics"" or ""Quantum Physist"".PEOPLE WILL DO ANYTHING TO MAKE MONEY, THAT IS TRULY AN UNDYING SECRET THROUGHOUT HUMAN HISTORY, I TELL YOU THAT FOR FREE."
3,The Secret (Extended edition),Nothing you already didn't know ----- just elaborated upon over and over and over again. Wouldn't recommend this.....although did hear from others that they enjoyed the read.
3,Commercial but effective.,"Because there is so much hype about this DVD, it has become very commercial. Many people are viewing it without understanding the true purpose of ""The Secret"". This is not a how to be a millionaire DVD. If people buy into that, they will be very disappointed. It is, however, a way to motivate yourself to be the best person you can be by living a positive existence. When you have an open mind and know what you really want, the way will be shown to you."
4,Life Changing Video,"If you don't know the secret, this book will totally change the way you view your life and if you use what you learn you WILL change your life.If you already knew the secret, whether you called it ""the secret"" or not, this video re-enforces what you know and gives great examples of how to expand this way of thinking throughout everything in your life.Buy this DVD, watch the Secret and change your life."
5,The Secret,"Loved this book. It's given me a lot to think about. Anxious to read it again to try and really understand ""The Secret"". Very well worth the low price."
2,LEMMINGS!,"Obviously, most of these reviews are written by the very young and the very dim-witted. Rhonda and her cohorts did a great job of taking old, commonly-held theories in physics and status-quo beliefs in metaphysics and turning out their own version of ""Down the Rabbit Hole"" (sequel to ""What the Bleep""). Swell, for newbies, but sorely lacking for those who hope to find actual content. In the end, ""the secret"" is never actually revealed to the viewer during the DVD presentation, leaving room, of course, for a sequelof their own!"
5,Here you are!,"Revealling the law of attraction can evoke a lot of resistance since it goes straight backward into every assumption and believe you ever build up.Going behind those borderlines feels like loosing it all untill you accept that constantly thinking of limitations is in your(my) way of having it all.The DVD is therefor quit a job to watch, to me anyway.See for yourself, try for yourself; it will not cost you an extra penny!!"
3,Some good things,"Overall, I enjoyed the DVD and concepts put forth, but I have a couple issues with it. One, the intro is really hokey. Two, they really kind of gloss over the fact that you do need to actually DO something about your life, not just visualize it. If one doesn't pay close attention, one could easily walk away with the impression that all one needs to do is imagine the perfect life and voila, it will come to you. Nevertheless, I agree that positive visualization is important, and this DVD makes that apparent."
5,2nd copy,I loaned out my first copy of The Secret and the person took it on a trip so i felt like i needed to get a second copy...i have found after watching it several times that i get new info that maybe wasn't popping out the first couple times i watched. I am going to order more as gifts...i have gotten a lot out of watching it and highly recommend it for anyone interested in The Law of Attraction!
3,It's fine... just fine,"Really... I expected something more interesting, I'm not saying it's a ""bad"" movie... no way! simply that the content didn't revealed many new things about life, cosmos and human nature.Maybe it could be a better movie with less of all that ""Hollywoodesque"" style (visual and sound FX between every little dialog) and less ""background"" animations.Anyway... it's just my point of view... in the end anyone who try with it may find something valuable in the product."
1,A recorded book which is tedious to navigate.,"I loved the book so much I couldn't wait to get my hands on this. Bought 6 to hand out to friends, got 3 in one package from GoHastings. Where're the other 3? Went to wrong address and was returned. Anyway. As soon as I got the SEALED package, I extracted one copy. Cut my day at work, went home and prepared to watch. Yea! Opened the package. NO bloody DVD! I was a bit disappointed - NO. VERY disappointed. Luckily the other 2 had DVDs in them, so at least 2 of my friends got their copies. I got NONE. I will NEVER purchase another thing from GoHastings (they refused to replace the DVD - 'time had run out', they said).That being said, the DVD was disappointing, to say the least. I must have gotten my wires crossed, because I thought the 'Secret' movie was a... MOVIE. Not so. It's just the book recorded; plus, I had to be navigating between chapters. The 'extended edition' is nonsense. If you have the book, don't waste money on the DVD, and vice versa."
2,Underwhelming,"There are a few nuggets of value to be gleaned from this dvd. But overall, I was not too impressed. I did not like the format. They'd have a person say something for like 30 seconds then move on to another person for another 30 second blurb and so on and so on. Some of the things said are just plain silly which takes away from the credibility of the entire program."
3,The Secret,"Interesting and the theory is good, but a little too materialistic based for my liking. However if you need an introduction to positive thought, give it a try!"
2,Bright idea......,"Hey, i've got a bright idea. Instead of sitting around hoping your life will come together why don't you get your fat *ss off the couch and go out and make something of yourself. Sure, human will has allot of power but truly it is action that makes you who you are."
1,Oprah has Lost All Credibility With Me!,"I ordered this DVD following the second Oprah show featuring the subject. I missed the first show, but it sounded monumental. When the DVD arrived, I promptly put it in. Within minutes, I was feeling like a total fool, duped into buying something so ridiculous. The DVD is terrible!!! Lots of mysticism and focus on obtaining material wealth. It is very poorly put together.I fell asleep during the first watching, then made myself watch it a second time just to make sure I hadn't missed something that would change my life. Nope - 'fraid not.I leafed through the book version in a store recently and saw it contained some good quotes. If you have to purchase a version, I would take the book over the DVD. But honestly, they were both huge disapppointments. What was Oprah thinking to recommend such hogwash?"
5,The Secret,everyone should own this DVD.It would change the world if everyone could get it and put it in to practice.
5,Excellent- Not for the weak minded,"For the people who watched this dvd and feel that the dvd is selfish, well apparently you didn't watch the dvd until the end.It works and I have been doing this all these years but never knew what to call it. Whether it is the Law of Attraction or just a can do attitude this is definitely something you should watch if you're open to letting it in."
3,ITS OK,"There are alot of people who really really loved this dvd, HOWEVER, I thought it sort of trivialized some very important and absolutely true information.If you ""wish"" of a big house of fancy car, you don't ge it!"
4,Entertaining but lacking in substance.,"As a long time student of the teachings espoused in ""The Secret"" I have a slightly different perspective. In my opinion, these ideas are not a secret at all and the fact that the makers of The Secret choose to make it sound so mysterious has more to do with marketing than anything else.On the other hand, I think the movie has good entertainment value and some very inspiring stories. Overall I found it to be a positive experience, hence my rating of 4 stars. For those who are completely new to metaphysics, this is probably a perfect introduction. For one like myself, the hype obscures the value of the teaching presented.Please note, this ""Extended"" version does NOT include the interviews with Esther Hicks."
2,You can be Rich and Lazy,"I'm not going to write a long review here. But I thought this CD focused way too much on financial gain. And when I say gain, I mean without exerting much more than positive thoughts.""Sick of getting bills in the mail? Imagine checks instead of bills!""And that is not a simplification of the concept. Ah Geeze!"
1,Snake oil,"I was shocked at the amount of positive reviews... This movie and all its ""laws"" come straight out of the snake oil salesman book.They create laws (the ""law"" of attraction) that is no more law than the ""law of my carpet cleaner"" and then use pieces of common knowledge, and quotes from famous people to give their ""laws"" credibility. The funny thing is - those same people they are quoting would never agree with the shallow and twisted meaning the producers are attributing to them.Yes, there are some positive things (mostly things you already know) but that is part of the snake oil salesman strategy. They use common, positive knowledge, to get people to start nodding their heads, and when the watcher (or reader) goes on, lots of plain lies start getting thrown in there - in a very deceptive manner and sandwiched between real common knowledge.Stay away."
4,Presentation and Application Unique to Each Consumer,"When I first saw this video I realized that we accomplish what we focus and dedicate ourselves too.The video and it's concepts require more study on my part. As for the overall ""counsciousness"" responding to your needs and thoughts, I am not sure. Drifting around aimlessly produces nothing. Otherwise, the DVD was packaged and shipped in a timely manner."
5,"Excellent, Exciting, Uplifting...","I have shared ""The Secret"" with my whole family and we've all gotten so much out of it. It's not a new thought, but it's a wonderful reminder of what we all may have forgotten about ""The Power of Positive Thinking."""
5,ITS NO SECRET,"The SECRET is a well made film that seems to validate what most people already know! Its positive message is very inspiring and you will want as many of your friends and family to watch it. Truly, ITS NO SECRET... its just that we need to be reminded of the power of intention! A MUST SEE!"
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"If you're a believer in fate, a follower of Christ, believer in God, don't waste your money or time. The ""secret"" is, if you want something (to be a millionaire, to have a successful career, to be able to buy your dream home), all you have to do to get it is believe that it's ""on its way to you."" If that were true, nobody would be living in poverty, broke or homeless. The Secret reminds me of those forwarded e-mails that state, ""Forward this e-mail to 10 friends in 10 minutes...""I found that The Secret conflicts with my religious beliefs... that you don't get what you want, but what you need... from God.However, as you read other reviews you'll find many people loved it and believe in it. At the very least, it helps you to think positively, and we can certainly use more positive thinkers in this world."
4,Excellent intro to Law of Attraction,"This DVD is a marvelous introduction to Law of Attraction material. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to break out of poverty, conflict and disease."
4,Must believe,Thought provoking and inspirational at the least. Well worth the read. Easy read and I have been through 3 times already and plan on reading several times a year. Must believe
1,Waste of money,"This same thing has been said over and over again throughout history and it isn't anything new. Positive thinking...a person doesn't need to waste $30 to figure that one out. Save your money, all your doing is making someone else rich."
1,Must be an idiot to watch more than 5 minutes,"Actually, I watched 5:36 of this until I heard that the ""law of Attraction"" is the secret. Essentially = the power of positive thinking. I decided I didn[t need to watch another 1:39:00 of the same nonsense"
4,It should have subtitle !!!,"It quite good, but it doesn't have any subtitle.This story was printed in many country in the world, and many foreign like me really like this story. But they didn't make any subtitle, at leats just ENG it's enought. Or if they can, they should make others langauge too."
1,OPRAH SAYS BUY THE SECRET AND ALL HER LAMBS FOLLOW!,Oprah is amazing. She endorses this and everyone buys the dvd. She gives the Secret her blessing and everyone believes. Scary World We Live In!
4,Wonderful,"A gentle and loving reminder that ""thoughts are things"" and affect everything and everyone around us"
5,The Title of the Year,"Watched the Secret twice, just to make sure we didn't miss anything. It is like one of those great Classics; that you could watch or read over and over. One of those subjects you either ""get it"" or ""not"" as Dr. Phil McGraw says. And we ""Got It"". We are just waiting for (we try not to push) our married, employed, own their own home, wonderful children, to ask for our copy to watch. It is truly an enlightening veiw."
3,The Secret....,"I guess this is a good tool to get one thinking, but I feel there is a bit more to it. Each individual was ""designed"" uniquely...therefore our wants and needs are also unique to each individual. The ""secret"" to obtaining these goals starts with discovering who you are (i.e. your strengths, weaknesses, gifts and talents) and using those resources to become the person you were designed to be....and ultimately reaching your goals. There is a great study that will lead you through this process, called Blueprint for Life. I found it much more benficial than ""The Secret"" because it gave me the resources to proactively reach my goals...not just ""thinking it"", but actually ""doing it"". They just updated their website and added ""online communities"" if you want to do the study with others. [...]"
4,creamy treatment for furniture,"For my oil finished furniture, Parker & Bailey Furniture Cream is ideal. It feeds the wood restoring the finish to its original luster and beauty. It is like hand cream for furniture."
5,JUST AMAZING!,"I saw this concert along with my family during Father's Day... It was wonderful, I enjoyed it sooo much! I must buy a CD and had to buy the DVD for someone else... a person that I know would enjoy it ... He did...I would buy it again. It is excellent, I recommend it 100%!"
3,Live The Concert Event,It was by far the best cd that Yanni has put together. I would love to go to this concert. He played my favorites in a very different way that made them their own.SUPERB!!
3,"Vivid, but with same old tricks ...","No doubt Yanni's concerts are always full of energy, and often times beat some of his studio recordings. My overall impression of this ""Live Concert Event"": quite vivid, yet still with a bit too much show-offs of different instruments. Almost half of the songs are from his Acropolis show but presented in inferior versions and almost with all the same old tricks. The music sounds less dedicated and organized. Probably it's a difference due to the absence of Royal Philharmonic Orchestra that the music is rather plain compared to the 1994 live release. Personally I think the Acropolis concert is one of the best CDs ever but definitely not so for this Las Vegas encore."
4,Mostly good,"All in all, an entertaining read. They do spend a lot of time debunking Hancock, but since he is at the forefront of the Antlantis/aliens line of thinking, I found this aspect of the book to be satisfying and entertaining. My one caveat is that in the ""Star of Bethlehem"" section, they quickly dismiss the possibility that Mathew could have simply invented the story on the basis of the fact that many people who may have known Jesus would still be alive. Really?! How many of these people witnessed his birth? Isn't it the most logical possibility considering that it's the only gospel that tells this story and that it plagiarizes several other myths? I think the authors are simply being kind to the religious minded readers with this weak argument. But I suppose that's to be expected. And the rest of the book makes up for it.If you enjoy this topic, Jared Diamond discusses Easter Island and the Mayan collapse quite well inCollapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed"
5,A Good Pre- Facts of Life Book,"I read this book from cover to cover before giving to my 10.5 yr old. It was just what I was looking for - I thought she was too young for full-on facts of life & sex talk, but the girls in her class were going through changes. I needed something to introduce the topics but nothing too heavy. This book did just that. It covered taking care of your body, and why changes were happening. I particulary liked the way it promoted these changes as a wonderful and exciting time in the child's life. Its now 9 months later, the book is well-thumbed, and we're moving onto a girl-facts/boy-facts type of book. I would highly recommend it as the ""first"" book, but does need to be followed up at a later stage with more detail - book or talk.Well written, beautifully presented & great images - how about a similiar one for boys!"
1,Inappropriate for 9 year-old,"This book was purchased to start a discussion with my 9 year-old daughter about her body. I was shocked that this book was titled as a ""Book for younger girls"". The images and illustrations in this book are very unnecesary; girls sitting on the floor looking at their parts with a mirror, and bare chested girls talking about their periods!!! It had too much information on tampons and sex and I did not find it helpful at all. I'm still looking for a simple book to introduce my daughter to puberty."
5,A great book to get the dialogue going...,"I checked out this book from our public library and read it first on my own. The format of the book is several short chapters filled with great information followed by questions submitted by girls, which then the author goes on to answer. The book is written in words that are easy for kids to understand and the illustrations are clever and funny. In the other reviews, I read about concerns with the subject of masturbation. That is found ONLY in a question in the Q & A section of Chapter 7. I personally did not feel comfortable with the topic at our age group so when I BOUGHT our own copy, I just tore page 79-80 out and by doing so I didn't disturb neither the end of Chapter 7 nor the beginning of Chapter 8. Overall, this is a great book to get the conversation started with my daughter (almost 10) that has just started taking the leap from little girl to young lady. I have three daughters and I will use this book with all three. Hope this helps..."
5,Audiable pleasure to the ears,After looking at top of the line stores I was completely frustrated with their line of speakers. I use a specialty shop in Arizona for all of my other needs. Carver pre amp and amplifier. Carver 2500 watt cube subwoofers. I took a gamble and bought the Infinity center channel speaker and matched this up with my ancient Akai tower speakers. I was blown away by the clarity of the speaker. I invested my money into the Infinity Beta 50 3 way speakers to match my satellite speakers which are infinity speakers. You feel as though you are in a Movie theater with this combination of Infinity products. I highly recommend the entire line of infinity products. With age they will only become better.
5,Foot Heaven,"I had to reorder this after finding myself running low on my last tube. All I can say is this is like instant spa for your feet. The tea tree oil is the trick. If you try it, you will like it."
5,A Charming Way to spend Thanksgiving,"To read Edward Bleier's book, The Thanksgiving Ceremony,is to arrive at the pleasant conclusion that at last wehave a way to be truly thankful - and celebrate theoccasion with words and music as well as delicious foodand wonderful family.This is a book for all ages, and a lovely addition toone's library --- truly a 'must' for everyone."
3,"Somewhat sub-standard production quality, but excellent tunes and arrangements","The Kingston Symphony Orchestra might not be the very best ensemble in the world (and it shows on this recording), but the lasting power and beauty of the songs on this album and some of the new and lovely arrangements of them are worth the listen. There are some definite technical and musical flaws as far as the recording and ensemble go, but the music and how it's arranged makes up for it.Three stars for some soaring moments, due to classic tunes and arrangements.My main beef: Where's The Little Mermaid?? Why discount one of the most beautiful Disney scores ever written?"
2,one of thoseif you are desperate you'll buy anything,cut a hole in my car seat. maybe after a month of practice this might work. i gave it two stars for the glue
4,Surprising!,I read this book for a class I was taking and I didn't expect much from it. But I was wrong. This is a very good book and the information is both surprising and relevant. I probably would not have read this book except for my class and I would have missed out on a lot.
1,Worst book I have read in a long time,"I have been trying to get through this book for a few weeks now, and am about half through. I am still waiting for things to pick up and some sort of story or analysis to appear.Donna rambles about her ""rebelious"" youth as a ""rocker"", interjecting anecdotes of her own in a thinly veiled attempt to show us how much she understands the youth of the late 1980s. Or maybe she just didn't have enough material and interest in an autobiography.Donna sensationalizes the reality of growing up in suburbia and does so under the guise of trying to help the kids she is writing about.Donna is like your high school guidance counselor: talking at you while you dart your eyes around her office looking for a distraction until you are no longer in her presence."
3,Not a good book for beginners.,If you have read Flash MX Training from the Source...then you should know there're lots of missed information on this book. The instructions are not very clear. Many places don't even point out where the tools are. This maybe a good book if you already know Dreamweaver. Not recommanded for new users.
4,Dreaming?,"While, I have heard the contention that dreams serve a purpose of helping a person deal with events in their life, I cannot recall any that have accomplished that in my life. The book mentions that category and I wish some time had been spent on that subject. As far as the book went, I found the various experiences of case histories fascinating. Especially the one of Socrates, in which the dream was actually prophetic."
3,Velcro Back,"Didn't pay enough attention to the particulars and didn't realize it had a velcro back so you can change out the squeakers. It's great for my mom's dog that just likes to squeak, but horrible for my dogs that are rougher on toys."
3,"Kong Sitting Frog Dog Toy, Med, Green","Cute toy and my dog loved playing with it but eventually I had to take it away and only allow him to play with it while I supervised. He was pulling off the green fluff and eating it. The fluff would get stuck in his throat, much like popcorn hulls do with people, and he would choke on it."
2,ok for VERY small dogs,"Got this for a daschund, she loved it, but it is NOT durable at all. There are better choices out there!"
2,another waste of money,"I have yet to find a toy that my 9 month old Jug (Pug & JRT Mix) can't destroy in less then 1 hour. She manages to pull the pouch out - by the eyes of the animal - and just goe's to town with it. I will have to stick with cheaper toys, it doesn't seem to matter if they are $2 or $12 toys, she has destroyed them all within 30 min or less."
5,perfect!,"4 dogs later & they are still going strong! you know its going to be good, if you buy Kong!"
1,Not what they used to be,"I have bought several of these Kong stuffed animals for my dog. She loves then and they last a long time.I was completely taken aback when I opened this package. The item is completely different than shown---much lower quality that it used to be, and not what is in the picture. I can't imagine that it would last more than a few minutes with my border collie mix. I plan to return it.Shame on Kong for changing their products to this cheap item!"
5,Santana is back on top!,"This album restores my faith in Santana. It is not just for fans and collectors. Rarities does not imply poor sounding tracks, as other artists have done. I could live without the pointless remixes, are they going to remix the original 3 albums next? But the whole thing gets a rare 5/5 from me... especially since I got it new for $4.99."
3,"Great outer quality, not so great inner",CD holders and flaps are SUPER cheap! It is HUGE though!I doubt it will hold up with that many in CDs in it.A little expensive for the quality and shipping was pretty slow.The outside is sturdy. I will just have to turn the pages carefully.
4,Better than I expected,"When this was announced, I was expecting it to be, at best, terrible. So far I have been pleasently surprised at both the scripts, and the acting. The storyline so far has been interesting, and I like the way that they are slowly revealing his origin story week to week, and not all at once in the first episode or two. It is too early in the series to say this is a great series, but so far it is well worth the time spent watching."
5,Good series,Good series. A bit predictable but fun anyway. The characters are well developed. The acting is good. Special effects are good.
3,another super hero,"As a very young child, I learned to read using comic books: Superman, Batman, the Flash and Green Lantern. Green Arrow, unlike Batman, although technically not a SUPER hero, has not (to the best of my knowledge) been portrayed on the big and only once on the small screen. Can't really say about this newest incarnation, yet, although Smallville's Oliver Queen left a little something to be desired."
4,Entertaining,"This aspires to comic book moviedom, like a Dark Knight, or Spiderman. For a TV show it comes pretty close."
5,Awesome CW Show,"I always look forward to seeing this show, its action packed and never misses a beat! I hope that the CW keeps it going! With every new episode the plot get better! The actors are great for their roles!"
5,I had to cancel,I had to cancel my order with ship2you for a Sony CD Changer because my son bought one with some birthday money...theycancelled my order promptly when I emailed them. I will buy from them again because of this...
1,poor,"I needed the book asap, so I ordered speedy shipping. I desperately need the book for school and it's still not here!"
1,one word-don't,"If you read & liked the other 3 books in this series, don't read this one. It was written as if Ms. Bradley hadn't bothered with considering the story developments within the other sequles to BLACK TRILLUIM. (Blood Trillium & Golden Trillium) There is no continuity between it and the other sequels. I was very disappointed."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The Duncraft 18202 Safe Haven Wild Bird Feeder With Metal Seed Tray has several problems making it a waste of money. First, a design flaw makes it impossible to clean so when it rains the seeds congeal together and there is no way to get the old seed out. Second, another design flaw makes the thing apt to fall down to the ground (the rope is still connected to the top of the feeder but the top of the feeder and rest of the feeder won't stay together."
2,Not a good choice,"The roof leaked during a light rain and all the seed was ruined. The design seems guaranteed to leak. I sealed mine with acquarium sealer, but I don't know if that will work. Gray squirrels can't get in, but red squirrels sure can, so it is only squirrel-proof if grays are the only ones in your yard. It is very heavy and needs serious support to hold it up."
4,Smart and original.,"The title is what first caught my eye--one of those titles that made me say, ""Whaaaa?"" So I checked it out.It's tough to acutely depict the message Ms. Strauss tries to get across in this work--one must see it with his or her own eyes. One must read the novel and interpret the ideas with one's own mind. Each of the stories that comprise the novel are braided into one another until the final, which makes the work particularly noteworthy.This work is a different read; a novel with smart organization and catalytic prose.I recommend it."
1,Die hard Western Fan's opinion,"I was raised on Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, The Lone Ranger, John Wayne and anyone who wore a stetson and rode a horse.You can't get much better for a cowboy than Tom Selleck and Sam Elliott. I am glad to add this fine collectionto mine. As to Catlow, not in the caliber of the first 2 but a nice addition to my collection to have YulBryner in something other than The King and I and Magnificent 7. Thanks Amazon for making this available andat an affordable price."
5,Good Movies,"Really enjoy the movies, more than the books. The actors really bring out Louie's books and what the cowboy was ""really'' like."
3,"Not his best, but certainly novel","As a big Christopher Moore fan, I was disappointed in this book. However, the topic was interesting."
5,I'd give it 6-7 stars if I could,"This is simply the funniest book I've read in years. For us Christians with a sense of humor, it's laugh-out-loud hilarious. Biff tells the story of his lifetime friendship with Joshua of Nazareth (""I refuse to use that Greek name, Jesus""), from kid games (acting out stories from the scriptures) to a kind of ""team manager"" for the disciples. Every few pages I had to wipe my eyes because the laughter had filled them up again. While it portrays a surprising Christ occasionally (I could have done without the mild profanity in some of ""Joshua's"" dialog toward the end, but Biff's salty language was funny throughout), still it's basically a reverent book. And true to what I believe of Christ's humanity and divinity. I bought six copies as gifts for friends!"
5,Monty Python: For A Book!,"I first heard about this book from a couple people that said it was hilarious. Well, I decided: I better check it out! From the moment I read the product description online, I knew I was in for an awesome ride... well; i'm here to tell you--I was not disappointed! From the stupidity of the angel, to Joshua's love of irony, this book keeps you rolling from the beginning to the end. Warning: it is not meant for little kids! There is a lot of adult humor in it, so know your tolerance before you read it. Other than that, this book is a winner, and I can't stop re-reading it! It is the first thing I read from Christopher Moore, and know I'm buying all his books! Definitely read this! It's non-stop fun!!!"
2,"A few funny moments, but it's definitely been done better.","While there's some funny stuff here, Moore is not in the league of Christopher Buckley or Monty Python when it comes to generating laughs, or in the league of Gorman Bechard's ""The Second Greatest Story Ever Told"" when it comes to religious satire. Moore's book is way too long, with the humor running thin before the half-way mark. (It really is a struggle to finish). I can't recommend, even to fans of his other books. Life is just too short."
1,I was sorry I suggested this!,"I recommended this book to my book club. There are 6 women in my book club. We have been meeting for six years now and I think this is one of 4 books we all really didn't like. 3 of us couldn't bring ourselves to finish the book. The other three did not like the book. I am surprised at all the excellent reviews. I must admit that I did not finish the book so I can't give much of a review, but I did feel like it was worth saying my book club did not enjoy this one. Everyone agreed the book just got too weird and a couple of people were put off by all the time spent discussing how Joshua (Jesus) finds out as much as he can about sex. Another girl said she did not like the way they portrayed the angel as really unintelligent. For me it started off OK, but went downhill quickly. The others said it never got better!"
3,The middle portion didn't live up to the beginning or end,"Everyone I know that has read this book raves about it; they say it's ""hilarious"" and ""Moore's best"". I was disappointed. Maybe it's because my expectations were so high? I thought the idea was amusing and a (few) parts were laugh out loud funny, but overall I was bored. This didn't at all hold my attention like ""A Dirty Job"" did.It started out strong and I was intrigued. I liked reading about Joshua, Biff and Maggie and their youthful misadventures. But when Joshua and Biff strike out on the Silk Road and end up living with one of the 3 wise men, his imprisoned demon and 7 Asian concubines, I really started to lose interest. I had to force myself to read most of the book, only becoming interested again when Joshua and Biff return and hook up with the apostles towards the end.Overall, I give it a strong ""Eh"". I won't be picking up a Moore novel for awhile; after this I need a break."
5,GREAT BOOK TO READ,"Christopher Moore has an intellectual humor that is untouched. I'm glad he is sharing this in his novels. With this book (Lamb), I became hooked (I then read Fluke).There are a lot of excellent authors out there today, each with his or her own personal style (that match that of another author). I really enjoy Christopher Moore because he seems to have a style of his own. I would read this book again and again."
3,"A good book, not The good book","I really enjoyed the first half of this book, it was creative, entertaining and very enjoyable. The second half was a little distubing and left me longing for the good times of the first half."
3,Fantastic except when it's lame,"Moore follows the story of Jesus's least-known disciple, Biff. Biff's gospel tells the story of Jesus' childhood and coming of age. Those parts that take place in and around the Holy Land, and among familiar characters are hysterical. The writing is smart, the humor is from insight into personalities and the ""back story"" of events reported in the (better-known) gospels.If Moore had limited himself to these areas, this might have been one of the funniest books I've ever read. Unfortunately, he veers into a silly side track into Asia that lacks the charm of the beginning and end of the book. I'm glad I didn't give up, because the end was as good as the beginning; but it was a chore to slog through the middle. I loaned my copy to a friend, and she found the mid-section so annoying that she returned it withough having finished it.I would recommend this book because the good parts were so good, but be prepared to come across some really bad chapters."
5,A fun read,"This is a great book that made me laugh out loud at some points. Obviously from a Christain perspective it's to be taken lightly. If you are the type of person to be easily offened in your faith, then this book probably isn't for you. But if you're looking for a good, entertaining story I wholy recommend this."
2,Its just not that Funny,"I read this as part of a book club, and it just wasn't that funny. Its the bible a la 12 year old boy humor. Yes, there were funny parts, but it got old after a while. I didn't know anything about the story when I started reading. Once I figured out that it was a retelling of the bible story, with some gaps filled in, the story became rather predictable. And the humor got repetitive. Its an easy read; I just wish I had spent my time reading something else."
5,A message behind the manic humor,"I laughed until I snorted several times while reading Biff's account of growing up with Jesus. Beneath all the poking-fun-at humor, the sex, and the language that I (a substitute teacher) am not allowed to use in school, I found a wonderful message about love and loyalty and acceptance and inclusion. I can't wait for my husband to read it so I can pass it on."
5,MORE REALISTIC THAN THE BIBLE!!,"While I was living in an academy I was sharing a room with a guy who was reading this book for the third time. He was on the floor laughing every few minutes. So I wondered what was so special about this book?Well, after a few pages I knew why. It's with out a doubt the funniest book I've ever read. The story is a simple one, it's about JC and his mate Biff. It fills in the gaps of his childhood and teenage years.It's a pain in the face reading this, but it's well worth it.I'll be buying more Christpoher Moore's books pretty soon."
2,"Should be entitled ""Lame.""","It's hard for me to believe that a major publisher such as Harper Perennial thought this novel was worthy of publishing. The basic idea that Jesus has a wise-cracking best buddy maybe would be funny as a short story, but in the hands of Christopher Moore, the joke becomes tiresome after the first chapter. It just goes on and on and on. Moore just doesn't have the comedic talent one needs to pull off a book-length enterprise of this sort. In addition to lame gags, he relies on profanity and sex to shock the reader ad nauseum. Ultimately, it's an example of Christian apologetics dressed up in the garb of puerile hijinks."
5,I have never laughed so hard reading a book!,"I giggled and snickered my way through this book. At the time, I was taking an Intro to the Bible class in college, and we had just started the New Testament, AND it was Easter week. Talk about providence! If you like a taste of irreverance with your religion, then please read this!Moore definatly did his homework when writing this book, some of his ideas (aka, when Josh/Jesus heads East) aren't anything horribly new, but he puts a great twist on them, and makes it all very plausable. Well, mostly plausable, in theory anyways. The ancient ""inventions"" of stuff like cappacino and sarcasm will have you giggling, along with why bunnies are related to Easter and the first draft of the sermon on the mount. Josh definatly comes across as very human, with flaws and foibles, and Biff helps keep him that way. You don't have to know the Bible well to understand the book, but it helps. Even if you don't know all the Biblical details, read this anyway!"
1,I guess I'm too old,"What was up with this book? It just annoyed me so much. I couldn't finish it after a few chapters. The characters and situations were not funny nor did I feel sympathetic towards them. Therefore, it was time to move on to another book.Perhaps at 38 I'm too old to read this book. Nah. It just wasn't for me."
4,Glad to see Catch again,"Though I didn't think this book contained the wit held within this other books (Fluke, Practical Demon Keeping), I did enjoy the fun read.I thought that his rendition of the antics of these childhood pals, captures young boys and their behaviors, before they become dignified icons.And I was happy to see Catch again."
4,Funny.,"This was very funny up until Moore's take on the passion story, when it gets serious. I especially liked all the things Biff invents: matches, cream in coffee, sarcasm, etc. I also like it when he tries to fool Joshua (Jesus) by citing non-existent scripture, like Amphibians 6:5, for example, and Joshua, of course, plays the perfect staight-man. Moore obviously did his homework on this amusing tour of major world religions. I prefer a long, satisfying denouement and Moore's is rather abrubt, but the book was most enjoyable."
3,Biblical bromance,"I initially found myself rolling my eyes and grimacing, kind of like I did when I saw the movies ""Ted"" and ""The Hangover"". Not that the book, like those movies, was entirely bad, but the juvenile quality of the jokes was a bit heavy handed. Reminding myself that this was satire and pushing on, I found it easier to look past the shenanigans of the narrator Biff, and I began to appreciate the book and the character. While this book is definitely not for everyone, it was a good read and I would recommend it to anyone who is not easily offended by religious satire."
4,Lamb,"This book is sometimes hysterically funny, sometimes incredibly offensive. Christopher Moore doesn't necessarily aim to please in this clever rendition of a time period in Jesus' life we know nothing about, but instead offers up his insight of a young man struggling with his destiny while trying to survive adolescence with his colorful best friend. The modern day lingo could have passed on some of the cussing, and the story does get a little far fetched and long in the search for the Wise Men. In spite of this, if you enjoyed the rock opera ""Jesus Christ Super Star"" way too many years ago, I think you'll enjoy this book."
2,2.5,"Most the characters had the very same personality, speaking with the same indistinguishable sense of humor etc. No individuality. Some of the humor was too stupid.To sum up, the first quarter was bad, second good, third bad, forth OK. The obsession with sex became obnoxious real quick. I wasn't impressed. Seems if you are going to take on such a big subject it should be given more thought and care."
2,Not Strong Enough to Carry Long Book,"I am very interested in the academic Historical Jesus. This book was chosen because of its catchy title and premise that Jesus had normal friendships, which I do believe. If this were a short essay, I'd be happy. As the book continues, the sarcasm's cuteness wears off. Another observation is that one must be well read in the canonical gospels and tradition to understand many of the jokes. A certain person is attracted to a purported gospel written by Bif, Jesus' closest childhood friend. The author certainly did his research and is well-versed in Christology and the historicity of Jesus."
3,I was hoping for more,"Clever? Yes. By all means, it is clever. Funniest book ever? No way. The book was a bit too much like a fantasy novel for me to be absorbed by it. And although I recognized and appreciated the many humorous moments, it didn't make me laugh. Not once. A smile here and there, the occasional roll of the eyes. But unfortunately, I didn't laugh.That said, I wouldn't mind seeing Biff's story on the big screen. Hmmm..."
5,Lamb,It has a bit of a Forest gump sort of thing going on and I laughed out loud during many parts. Feel good quick read perfect for a summer day.
4,Entertaining Reimagining of Jesus' Life,"Excellent book. Compelling and funny. Christopher Moore created a very entertaining story out of Christian mythology about Jesus. The ""missing years"" part where Joshua and Biff travel to the East to seek the wise men was especially interesting. If you are familiar with the Bible you will notice a lot of subtle jokes along the way and appreciate the retelling of the early years and the final week of Jesus' life from Biff's perspective. I'd highly recommend this book."
4,Funny & philosophical,"Taking a look at Jesus through the eyes of his childhood friend is the kind of brilliant humanism that the son of G*d could use more of. Following Jesus and Biff as they ""backpack"" through Asia, these pages are filled with laughs and thoughtful insight into a variety of faiths and religions."
1,I tried to watch it!,This movie definitely is not Hollywood status.I literally sat there for 10 painstaking minutes trying to watch it but it wasn't possible for me.Why I spent Instant Video credits on this I have no idea.
5,No distortion,I wish amazon had a 4.5 rating for this product because that is what i would give it. The lens fits right on my Sony DSR-300 video camera with no problems. The lens is distortion free (with some wide-angle lenses the corners can be distorted). It does give a wider angle for the camera but not as wide as i expected. The lens works great for those tight angles inside houses. I do filming for a church camp similar to habitat for humanity and it was difficult to film construction in tight spaces like closets and small bathrooms. This lens helped out in letting me get better filming of those spaces. I wish it was a little wider but i guess it would have been distorted that way. For the price it is hard to beat compared to third party models. It worked for me and I would totally recommend it to anyone who is interested in a distortion free wide angle lens.
4,Mission Hit!,"Mission Kashmir may not seem like a great hit at first, but after you see it, you will definitely love it! The music and dancing steals the show, with the sensuous dance moves of Hrithik Roshan: Equivalent to America's John Travolta, and the beautiful, caressing style of Bollywood Siren Preity Zinta: Equivalent to America's Christina Aguilera, minus the sexuality. The action is superb, and the acting is wonderful. Sonali Kulkarni shows her vivid emotions brilliantly as a torn mother, and Sanjay Dutt makes you believe that he is actually the character, and not just an actor. Jackie Shroff is a pro at being a shady villain, which not many Bollywood stars can do, exception of 'Road' with bombshell newcomer Payal Rohatgi. Yet, do not let children see this: It is definitely R-Rated material. Once a child is 12, then watch it with them, and if they are 15, they may see it alone. Definitely rent it first, and then buy it!"
1,One of the worst films I've ever seen....,"This is a really bad Bollywood film. I don't like most films from India, but this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It tries to combine Rambo style combat, musicial numbers, a love story, and a story about the importance of the Kashmir struggle, and it ends up being a really bad joke. It trivialises and cheapens the Kashmir conflict worse than a Hollywood studio would, and that's really saying something. The performances are over the top, the musicial numbers are totally out of place here, and the message is simplistic and insulting. The only good thing is that the film is mercifully short (by Bollywood standards). It's only 157 minutes, but it is still painful to watch. There is a good film to be made out of the Kashmir conflict, but this isn't it."
5,AWESOME STORY,"This is one of those stories that, though very well told, is difficult to watch and even to fathom. There are some stories, however that need to be told and that people should watch. This is one of those films. GREAT JOB!!!!"
2,"For die-hard ""Hogan's Heroes"" fans... and no one else!","For those whose only exposure to Bob Crane is ""Hogan's Heroes"" (or one of those ""home movies""!) this mediocre Disney ""comedy"" is worth checking out. Col. Hogan is a straight character, always wise cracking, always sure of himself but not much depth. Crane's character here is a bit of a wimp with an efemminate scream! Crane doesn not exactly give an Acadamy Award performance here (the recycled Partrage Family script doesn't inspire) but it does prove that Crane could play someone other than Col. Hogan with a little versitillity."
4,"Great story, but under-utilized Force and blind Jedi!","This was a well-constructed story, but like many of the Star Wars Novels, the writer fails to adequately describe the fight scenes by using too many abstracts...('Obi-Wan's light saber danced through the fight....'). This doesn't paint a very vivid or exciting picture of Jedi in action. The ONLY author that really gives you a blow-by-blow, slash-by-slash description of a good light saber fight is Michael Reaves in Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter! It was very nice to learn more about Kit Fisto and get a feel for his character - so Fisto fans should be well satisfied. Unfortunately, this novel is consistent with Episodes I-III in that it really makes the Jedi look weak. Their inability to detect the dark side really diminishes a fan's view of the Jedi as being a powerful cast and really gives the impression that the dark side is really stronger! Not to be negative, this is a good story, especially if you're a Fisto fan!"
1,"Poor writing, awful story","The Cestus Deceptions was by far the worst Star Wars novel that I have read. I am not often disapointed by expanded universe novels and own nearly all of them, however; this novel was a supreme disapointment. Poorly written and horrendously paced, the author showed no grasp of any of his characters (especially Obi Wan's), with many of the characters displaying the same attributes as the others. The clones were feminized, various non-sensical metaphors were reused repeatedly and the plot was implausible at best. Do yourself a favor and skip this book as well as any other by this no talent hack."
1,never received,"hello,after my order around 45 days ago, i still do not receveid the perfume. i have sent some messages but i did not have a concrete answer.so how do you think is my opinion on this product and above all from the provider..."
2,"looks good, but not dependable.","Great monitor with a cool factor of mototrized fold-down. The problem is the fold-down motor is not durable in regular use. I have owned this monitor for just barely 2 years, and the motor is defective. At every bump on the road, the monitor would automatically close, which drove the kids...and me crazy!! I originally had this professionally installed, and now, the technicians stated that the motor is defective/broken. I am disappointed and really was expecting a much more reliable product from Sony."
4,Great discussion base for middle schoolers,"As a middle school teacher of literature, I have found this book very helpful in stimulating pertinent discussions in my classroom. The plot centers around a high school where two boys who have a history of being bullied plot a revenge to the boys who have bullied them. Told from the points of view of several members of the community, the contemporary and controversial story unfolds.I have used this book in small groups to stimulate discussion as to the causes of school violence, and the ways to prevent it. My students, across the board, were stimulated by this book, and read it without hesitation. Todd Strasser writes believably and compellingly for his secondary school audience.I recommmend this book for adults to share with teens, having had the experience of profound discussions."
1,This should be an adult book only!!!,"My middle school student found this book in his library, wow. I am in the process of trying to get it pulled off ALL the shelves in the school district. Crimes are committed more often by copy cats and we certainly do not need another school shooting in the United States. It does not answer any students questions as to why school shootings happen I am not even sure adults can figure out all the reasons why.This should be an ADULTS ONLY BOOK!!"
3,so-so,"Okay, this was a halfway decent book. There were a few gaping holes though.1. The preps were, okay, TOO shallow. Not one of them actually realized what they had made happen. Okay, I've been picked on but no one is really like ""Deidre""...2. Did Brenden and Gary not realize they were walking, talking Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold ripoffs? Did anyone else not realize everyone was a Columbine ripoff?Brenden Lawlor - Eric HarrisGary Searle - Dylan KleboldRyan Clancy - Brooks BrownAllison Findley - Robyn Anderson (somewhat)Sam Flanch - Evan ToddDustin Williams - Isaiah Shoels (somewhat)Although you do get points for referring to Bohemian Rhapsody. Any novel that works Queen into it rules."
2,Disappointing,"I read this book because I had read the books about the 2 girls killed in Columbine and had thoroughly enjoyed them. I was vastly disappointed. This book was so boring and written very poorly. It was like the author couldn't make up his mind about whether to make this book a novel on nonfiction. In short, don't waste your time."
5,"Oh, my goodness!","Good fiction encourages the reader to think hard about the issues that affect our lives. The very best fiction does that and more - it encourages us to act on those issues. In this powerful, honest, and disturbing novel about guns and school violence, Todd Strasser gives voice to the victims, classmates, neighbors, parents, and students who held the guns - both fictional and real - and asks the reader what he can do to make a difference. Strasser goes beyond just the issue of gun control by presenting a compelling look at the intolerance that pervades our schools. He implores our educators and children to celebrate the differences that make us human, to value accomplishments beyond those on the athletic fields, and to recognize that marching to a different drummer is not cause for ridicule. I applaud Strasser, a fiction author, who uses his craft and his gift to encourage readers to be part of the solution to violence that is unnecessarily costing young lives."
1,Worst Copy to DVD ever...,"It almost seems like there was a diliberate attempt to find the worst possible copy of the movie and imprint on a DVD. Perhaps, the goal of the producers was exactly that, and if you are after the nostalgia of seeing that movie as it was shown in the theater with a broken projector, you may want to get this. However, if you are living in the real world, where records were replaced by CD's some time ago, you may want to abstain from this copy, even if the price is tempting, as it was for me.I could not even finish watching the DVD, both because of the quality and the movie itself, even thought I am a fan of Bronson films. But this copy... is relative to Condid's interview - everything that could have been made wrong, was made wrong."
3,Nice to see Bronson in a light hearted comedy,Charles Bronson in a different sort of role as a 38 year old porn writer who has a loving romance with a 16 year old girl by the name of lola. Of course their love is not meant to be and the viewer sees that. But during the film you get a chance to see Bronson act in a more comedy sense than his usual no nonsense tough guy image and it's a welcome relief. DIfferent type of film for Bronson and it does falter a bit towards the end but it's still a decent attempt.
5,"Great product for the price, no issues.","It was delivered quickly and works fine with our laptop.We purchased it as a replacement to one damaged by my children(""no, wires are not for chewing on, take it out!"" :)"
4,Best type of DVD player for mobile use,"Installed two DVD players with headrest monitors (also from BOSS). Best feature is the insert/eject mechanism without a drawer, which allowed mounting vertically inside the center armrest/console. Two players and two monitors are perfect for kids in the back seat. With dual channels and wiring included, they can watch separate videos or tune in to the other's player. One remote control was defective, but they interfere with each other anyway, so have to use buttons on the players. Another complication was the two players and two monitors took so much power a direct connection to the fuse panel (40 watts) was required."
2,not really good,got these jaw breakers and the color made them look good. but they r not. the outter body of the jawbreaker have a little flavor than the rest is just a ball of sugar. i mean straight sugar no flavor at all. you get what u pay for with these i guess.
3,operations manager,"great fit, great feel, sound quality with distance from my treo 650 is really bad. It's ok when the phone is on your hip. But more than 5 feet and you can barely hear the person lots of static. How ever people can hear me fine."
5,What are you people smoking?,This was one of the great books of our time.Hundreds of people refer to it....In one word. I grok!
3,If you were realy into the sixties you will love it,"I am a huge fan of Heinlein's early work, and this is an okay book, with things to ponder and things to offend. However, it seemed to me that this was the beginning of a drift away from hard sci-fic and into the acid culture stories. Far from my favorite."
2,seriously?,"The 1950's gender archetypes are probably the most interesting part of this story. I wish I was Jubal, Front!To his credit, through the character Jubal, Heinlein offers some very thoughtful philosophical musings. However, this book (esp the last third) was really hard to read. Painful, actually.The bottom line is that I cannot ""grok"" it."
5,I'd buy it,"I have not yet read this book, but it was recommended by a friend highly so I went out and bought it. Before I actually bought this I did some research on Heinlen, and that was more than enough incentive for me to buy this. I'm super sure that I will not be disappointed."
4,I've read better- but not much!,"I read this book as a research topic for my senior English class and loved it. At first, I started it because I thought it was about a man on Mars but when he came to live on Earth and I saw how he interacted with his surroundings and his ""water brothers"" I didn't know what to think. As I got further into the book I realized it was not about ""the man from mars"" but about Earth and the human race. The book talks about people not understanding something because it is different and that is so true in today's society. This book was great and I would recomend it to anyone who wanted to read good science fiction.-Danielle"
3,Not my favorite Heinlein,"Great author, good book. Was able to read most of the book despite Heinlein's misogynistic ideals constantly bleeding through his work. I was even able to read most of it despite my most hated cliche being the centerpiece of the book, the child like all powerful being. However, as I read on a perversion set on as the main charactered really ""discovered"" women and sex; not to say that these things don't have their place in stories. It became harder and harder to be as immersed in the story as I was before, and I had to keep putting down the book due to the frustration of this ruining the flow of the plot. Eventually it became so bad that it seemed like the story was going nowhere at that point and I stopped reading the book. I feel like this book was definitely a turning point in his writing for me as I prefer his earlier work a lot more, although there are a few exceptions. There is no doubt in my mind that he is a great author, but this book is just not for me."
2,it just didn't excite me,This book did not excite or interest it. I got about halfway lost my place and didn't feel like going back. Main problem was that I just didn't care about anybody in it.
3,"Half good, half bad","I loved the first half of this book, in which plot and character rose to the fore. Great action sequences, terrific dialogue, and tons of suspense tricked me into thinking that this was a five star novel. Jubal Harshaw in particular was--and remains--one of the most richly realized characters in contemporary fiction. Alas, the novel quickly sags beneath the weight of its own socio-political and pseudoreligious philosophies. The plot thins, the action comes to a screeching halt, the characters flatten into cardboard, and the rest of the novel becomes so self-consciously preachy and churchy and utterly unsexy (despite the frequent nudity and bedhopping) that it lost all appeal to me. Less politics, more plot. I could grok that, anyday."
5,My favorite novel,"Heinlein has taken a lot of flack for his view of women, but I consider myself a feminist, and believe his advocacy for women remarkable, particularly for someone born at the turn of the (20th) century. This is simply my favorite novel of all time, so I just had to have it for my kindle. The wry commentary on religion, sex and jealousy, government, advertising and mob mentality, all contained in an engaging tale with intelligent, interesting characters still seems fresh and relevant today; the idea of a Martian Civilization may seem far-fetched, but considering that this was written in the early 60's it still strikes me as prophetic."
2,When will we realize that sex is not love?,"First off, there is no question that Robert Heinlein could write. He wove words together masterfully, and one has no doubt what Mr. Heinlein was trying to convey emotionally, politically or otherwise. The issue I have with ""Stranger ...."" is Heinlein's continual insistence that sex = love, not just part of love. Let's face it, a series of philosophical conversations can be quite stimulating to the mind, but do not create the loving bond between two people any more than a political debate between two presidential candidates. Equally, a series of sexual encounters simulate the body, but does not create this loving bond. There are many other complicating factors in love that one book may not be able to explore alone, like patience, kindness, not self-seeking or proud. Others will disagree, but I did not get the sense that this factors where given importance in this book on utopian love."
2,I was glad to be able to put this one down,"Wow this book really dragged on. I found it really tedious, and almost didn't bother finishing it. I've read a lot of SciFi and his seems to fall in the pulp area. I read and enjoyed starship troopers and figured I'd give this one a try as it is supposed to be a 'classic'. I was really disappointed.The characters all just mill around this central god like figure with very little direction, feel for the rest of the world, or reader interest. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Do a search on a different author, there is lots of better books out there."
1,Go back to the original published version!,"This ""uncut"" version, published thirty years after the original publication, shows how wise editors can be. The original ""Strangers"" is a great book, influencing a whole generation. The ""restored"" material in this version slows down the story, and its blatant sexism and dialogue are very offensive, dating the book. ."
3,"A great, insightful book. If you ignore it's sexist views","This book was a great page turner, but at times it made me cringe... because of its blatant sexism -- relegating all female characters to sexy secretaries, who can cook. And some homophobia was also sprinkled throught the ending of the book (""Mike would grok it as bad"" -- if a guy tried to make love to him). In such an inspiring book of free love and the powers of the individual, its dated views in some respects brought me down. But nonetheless I recommend it. It is one of the best sci fi books I've read."
2,Good start then all downhill,"I was excited when I began reading this book, but after the abduction of Ben Caxton, it took a 90 degree turn and never came back. Beside the needless minutiae of the narrative, it just shifted from a caper to a religious hodge-podge. There is a good reason no one has ever tried to make a movie of this book. It would be horrible. There are much better books out there worth reading and I found myself just reading to get through it as I felt I had wasted too much time on it as it was."
5,One of my favorite books,"I think everyone should read this book at least once. It is more than just a sci-fi book, it is a novel, an interesting look at human thought and interaction. It is one of those books you can not stop thinking about, even years after first reading it. The main character interacts with fellow humans in a way that others have never even considered. People around him are either mesmerized by him or repulsed. His ""condition"" is the result of being raised on Mars after his parents had landed their and eventually perished. The story takes place at his return to Earth. Unbelievable that it was written when it was. Many of the subjects examined in this book are edgy or downright taboo even in our modern times. This is a truly timeless book."
5,Amazing,"I first read this book when I was in sophomore in high school. Everyone should read this book! The first part was slightly slow, but once it gets going, it is incredible. I would read for hours and hours at a time. The concepts introduced in this book have helped shape all my future thinking for the better. If you want to broaden your mind and spirit, read this book!"
2,Kind of choppy,"I thought this book could have been put together better. It's not terrible, but could have been a lot better. Nia Sebastian is a workaholic. She puts her all into her career and tries to put out of her mind the love she had for Brett Faulkner. Brett Faulkner enters her life after five years going by. Brett unexpectanlty rekindles the romance they once shared, but things are interrupted when Nia's mentor and close friend is suddenly murdered. Again, it's an interesting book, but you will get lost if you don't pay attention."
5,stainless sink to go with newly remodeled kitchen,"Arrived in good condition, and as promised. An EXCELLENT and BEAUTIFUL sink... I couldn't be more happy. I had reservations changing to a stainless sink from a white cast iron which I liked the cheerfulness of, but this is SOOO nice. Seems to be of better quality than many brands which we looked at in kitchen displays."
5,More here than meets the eye.,"Like any encyclopedia this is not a book that you want to read straight through, so after I read the first few pages, including the hugely entertaining Readers' Agreement, I set it on my desk next to my computer and occasionally flip it open and read a couple of random entries and always come away refreshed.You can read it just for fun and enjoy Amy's whimsical outlook on life, but I think the main strength of the book is how well it illuminates the small moments of the author's and, if you think about it, of your ordinary life, to reveal how everything you encounter or do in life is worthy of consideration and holds meaning. The book reflects this; there is not a word on any page, even those a reader usually bypasses, that was not thoughtfully put there."
1,Not of interest to everyone,"Some people will find this book howlingly funny- and perhaps there is a kinship amongst those who do. However, there are some of us who find it less than funny, and annoying in a sort of cutesy sort of way. Perhaps this website has more of an interest in this book than other books. Some have noticed that for some reason, every negative review of this book has disappeared from this website after about one day. That's not very ordinary."
2,Anyone could've written this,"I don't know- maybe I missed the point. I saw this book in a pile of advanced reader copies and decided to give it a try. I had never read anything by AKR before, so maybe I wasn't used to her style. The encyclopedia idea was interesting, but unnecessary. Some of her entries were funny, or at the very least relevant so I could say ""Yeah, that makes sense."" But a lot of it was purely dull, as it was about her childhood or how much she seems to adore her husband. I wasn't interested. What I don't understand is why she bothered to get this published instead of just reading it to her family and friends- because it seems to me that was who she wrote it for.Anybody could've written a book like this. Maybe not with as much flair and writing ability, but things have happened to everyone. I feel that Amy should now read my autobiography, since I'm no more or less interesting than she is."
2,WANTED to like it...,"I'd heard about EoaOL during a recent book club discussion, and it sounded like my cuppa tea -- positive, uplifting, something I'd enjoy. And, at first, it was. I liked the author's lighthearted observations and appreciation of life's simple pleasures. Then, it was like, ENOUGH ALREADY!!! What was initially cute and quirky soon became really boring and trite. I understand that the book's about an ""ordinary"" life, so maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree here??? Either way, I found myself hoping that, at some point, there'd be more substance, more take-away, more ""this is what I learned"" blah blah blah... but, unfortunately, no dice."
4,Loved this look into the things that make up the modern existance,"This quirky, fun little book is all about Amy, the author. Structured like an encyclopedia, with entries on all kinds of topics, Amy's encyclopedia entry covers everything from parking tickets to toast, the deep to the mundane. It is charmingly written and is surprisingly amusing and fun to read.My only complaint is that the structure of the book is such that I didn't really want to sit down and read it for more than a half hour or so, because there isn't really a narrative flow. This would be a great book to keep in the car for those moments when you have to wait for someone or kill a few minutes at a time.That said, the idea is so innovative and it is so charmingly carried out that I'd definitely recommend it. I enjoyed it all the way through, and the way she made the mundane things of life so interesting, gave me some new ways of looking at the mundane things of my own life."
3,Good,"This is a cute book, will make you chuckle, but kinda forgettable after 2 months. If a friend had it, I'd borrow it, but if I were to do it over again I wouldn't pay for it."
1,the partial image of a ghost of a story,"I am a simple man. And when I read a story, I would like to have the entire story before me, and not be forced to go to the internet to find the rest of it!!!!!!!This volume, incredibly, omits the third and final chapter of ""A Jolly Corner""! It was an intersting experience, accidentally, because reading it without the last chapter made one confront the basic construct of the tale. It seemed incomplete after chapter two, but complete after chapter three. What was the missing element? The female character of absorption and empathy. So, I am glad that the compilation is a complete disaster, as it forced me to confront what this particular short story is really about: female human-ness vs male ego driven self-delusion.""Washington Square"" is the only truly great work in the collection. I loved it.I rate it a one because surely a person can read these stories on the internet in their complete form."
4,"Interesting read, just wanted more of a conclusion.","Basically a book on speed. Some of the facts were fascinating, especially when it got into the lengths we go to as a society to do things faster and be more efficient. I was hoping for a little more on the negative psychological aspects of this kind of mindset though. Still, pretty good."
5,easy to use,"The Garmin 270 is very simple to use. It is small, but the screen is easy to see. I plan to take it to Europe this summer and hope the European maps are as reliable as the US ones! I love that it is portable and can fit into a little case, then into my purse."
2,cute but not enough,"Bought this for my daughter, she thought it was cute, but did not have the add on features she would of liked, so she returned it for one that suited her geek nature."
4,Garmin nuvi 270 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator,We really do like this item but sometimes it is not as accurate as we would like it to be. We have gotten lost sometimes. Maybe there is another model that is more accurate. When we know the area and where to go we know that it is taking us a different route. It is a good purchase for the money though.
4,Perfectly Fine,"The 270 works just fine in US cities (DC, LA, St Louis, & Boston so far); have not tried it in Europe. Am slightly disappointed because in comparing and contrasting the various Garmin models listed here--all at approximately the same price--I somehow thought the 270 provides directions in real street names--a definite plus. Wrong--that's the 260, which I wish I had ordered. Could live without the European capability of the 270, though it may come in handy someday."
3,"Good GPS, but takes a while for a signal","Good product overall, but it takes a while to acquire a satellite to operate the device. Otherwise, a good device for a pretty good price."
4,Nuvi 270 in Nantucket and Provence,"I used the Nuvi 270 in Nantucket in August and September and in Provence and Paris in October. It guided us to addresses and to ""points of interest"" in both places with visual and oral directions. In France, passengers in our rental car were impressed and plan to buy one. It guided us on one-lane roads in Provence and got us to our destination every time. It's database was great offering phone numbers for golf courses, restaurants, etc.The system for attaching and detaching it from a rental car windshield is terrific. The cigarette lighter plug set up is great. When you turn off the engine (and thereby power down the plug), the Nuvi 270 turns off and when you start up again it comes on. No human intervention needed.Having a voice that told us in English to take the ""2nd exit at the roundabout"" and displayed the same info at the top of the screen, also in English, as we were driving through France, made our trip much pleasanter.A winner from Garmin."
2,Mediocre GPS,"I purchased this unit when my Tom Tom One 3rd Edition died and was immediately disappointed. For twice the price of my dead unit I found an item that was incomplete, harder to use, and didn't have features that I considered extremely useful.I call it incomplete because to register the unit you need a USB cable that is not provided--after much frustration I discovered that the USB cable sent with the Tom Tom worked with the Nuvi.Two extremely useful Tom Tom features that are not on this Garmin are the map-correcting feature and the 'demo' feature. The demo feature allows you to 'test drive' the route at high speed with actually moving--the unit does the turn by turn as you watch. The map-correcting feature allows people to add/change/delete map items (like Gas Stations) on the map and upload them so others can download them for free without waiting for a new map to be published."
2,useless when I needed it,"I bought the Garmin nuvi 270 series a couple of weeks ago. Since that time I got lost two times. I live in New Rochelle, New York and had to go to an affair in Mahwah, New Jersey last week. It did not pick up any satellite in that area and I was lost for over 2 hours coming home in a rain storm and the GPS keep giving me directions ""to go home"" starting from my home address in New Rochelle. I nearly through the thing out the window."
4,All I ever need in a GPS,This was a good buy ~ perfect size for the space in my car (CRV) and very easy to use and set up!
4,Garmn Nuvi 270,"We purchased this unit for a trip to Europe. The car company was going to charge us 10 Euro per day to rent one. It was cheaper to buy this unit than to rent. The unit performs well. It has both the US and European maps. It would be 5 star if it gave turn instructions by street name. But for an economy unit, it does fine."
2,Great Size But No Way to Plot Before You Go!,"I just bought my 270 for a planned European excursion this summer and next. While it has no documentation, it seems fairly easy to use. Since I haven't gone yet, I'm unclear how it will perform in Europe BUT I already have a major gripe that it has no way (as far as I can tell, and the enclosed documentation gave no help) to plan routes before you arrive in Europe. I was trying to plan distances from hotels and restaurants, to museums and cities, and while you can see a detailed map of these foreign locales, there is no way of plotting a route!!! I cannot find a way of entering a starting point!!! This is pathetic!!! Even Yahoo Maps on my Blackberry World can do this. This is a major need to travelers that has been missed by Garmin on this device."
5,Outsanding product,"The Nuvi 270 lives up to its reviews. The screen size is fine - don't really need the larger screen of the 370. The road map is unbelievably complete -- in our remote little town it even knows about the little road stub past the library curbside book return!! Voice prompts are quite audible, and come at the right times -- once after a turn to advise when the next turn will come, once when about 400 yards away from the turn, and then right at the turn. Touch pad is pretty easy to use, but when entering the PIN, if you get it wrong it locks you out until you either return to your home place, or disconnect the external power and power unit off and then on (I had to find that out the hard way). All in all I'm very pleased with it."
4,Amazing,I just returned from Europe. The Nuvi 270 was amazing. Not only did it have all the major highways but the most insignificant of roads (some a little too small of our vehicle). I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a GPS that will be traveling to Europe.
1,Uninformed,"This GPS will get you to where you are going, but this was the first one i have bought so i didn't know what i was looking for. I have used a friend's Street Pilot exclusively up until this one so that is what i judged it on. It does not pronounce the street names and I like that feature. It also does not have the ""find me"" feature which has been helpful on the Street Pilot. I returned this for the 650 and am much happier."
2,Not faithful to comic,"The first thing i found was wrong with this movie was that Catwaomen's real name was Selena Kyle and in this movies its Patience Phillips. The Story is completly wrong, Catwomen is not as goood as they portray her in this movie. the only bad she does is stael stuff she gives back. And where is Gotham, where is batman, where is Bruce Wayne? If you want to see a movies about the real Catwoman see Batman Returns."
2,"""Cream, Straight Up"" ~ Mee-Ouch!","How could you make a film starring the lovely Halle Berry in the starring role wearing a very revealing costume most of the time and still have a disaster on your hands. I'm sure the director Pitof would like to know.Positives: Halle Berry has one of the prettiest faces and figures in film today. You'll probably watch the movie from beginning to end for that reason alone. Benjamin Bratt is terrific as Tom Lone, police detective and love interest to Patience ""Catwoman"" Phillips and Frances Conroy (Ophelia) provides some much needed depth and occult mystery to the plot as the historian and guardian of the Egyptian Goddess Baast and the ""Secret Society of Catwoman.""Negatives: Sub-par special effects, silly plot and a little too much S&M; motif in the choice of costume for my taste."
5,"great movie , quick delivery.!","cat woman is a terrific movie.halle berry is great as cat woman,im a cat /animal lover so i can relate to her !"
2,Poor Acting,"Although Halle Berry and Sharon Stone are fun to look at, the acting and plot of this movie are not very good."
3,Halle Berry Is The Perfect Catwoman,"Catwoman is a non-stop fun ride! Halle Berry is a purr-fect for the role of Catwoman! This is one of her best roles yet! Sharon Stone also stars as well, and is quite enjoyable. The film is quite funny as well. However, this film does have one cliche. The special effects in the film seem a bit fake. But overall this movie is enjoyable.Pros: Funny, Sexy, Enjoyable Cast, WatchableCons: Special Effects Seem A Bit Fake.Overall: *** stars"
2,Missed It By More Than A Whisker,"The performers did as good a job as they could with the material they were forced to work with, and if you want to see Halle Berry at her most breathtaking, this film is worth a look. It's not a well-written script, which is a shame, because if the story had even been just a LITTLE better, this would have been a great film. Instead, we can enjoy it for the campy pile of glitz that it turned out to be."
3,"Not purr-r-r-fect, but not horrible","When I rented this, I made sure to use it on a free rental. This movie had been panned so much I didn't want to spend ANYTHING. It wasn't that bad, to my surprise. My favorite scenes were the ones w/the cats. Sharon Stone was wonderful as the villian; kudos to her after her stroke. Halle Berry and Benjamin Bratt were also fine, and the chemistry between them kept me interested. The main problem I had was her costume. Could she be wearing any less? And running in heels? Forget it! I do recommend this as a fun, not-to-take-serious movie night. Make some popcorn, grab your cat, and enjoy!"
2,Disappointment,Fans of cat woman would be disappointed. I like cat woman but this movie is awful. It's one of those WTF movies. The plot was weird and well just ban. I am a huge comic book fan and very disapointment to see one of my favorite characters be portayed so bad.
1,Meowing Snore!!,"I just sometimes can't believe all the movies out these days. Particularly, when they seem to have all the hype, and fall like a big watermelon. Halle Berry truly proved to have all the hype, but falls flat on top of her feet and on her face with Catwoman. To be honest with you, I wasn't even impressed with this knock-off to the Batman franchise that has held well for years. Especially putting Catwoman as a heroine, instead of the popular villianess from earlier in the Batman stories. It really wasn't appealing at all for Halle Berry to take on this role in my eyes. She was much more like her super-heroine character Storm in X-MEN and X2, but not here. This is one I strongly suggest you don't see. Wait until the next real Batman sequel to hit those theaters over this junk!"
3,ok well...,"i only have a few things to say about this movie, good and bad...*the music is awesome*halle did a great job*the digital work looks really fake*the real catwoman isnt nice like in this moviebut all around the movie is OK ...."
1,Crapwoman,"This movie is terrible.For those of you who are comic book fans, this ""Catwoman"" is not based on the character of Selina Kyle, it is a totally different Catwoman which has nothing to do with the one from the Batman comics.The acting by Halle is mediocre. She is nothing but a pretty face. Another example is her poor attempt to play Storm. That role was fit more for an Angela Basset strong type. This movie is just a way to showcase her in tight leather. If it's Halle's hot body you wish to see, get Swordfish."
1,HA!,This movie is a joke! WB is going to loose money releasing this onto Blu Ray when no one buys it.
4,Who Can See in the Dark?,"This is probably one of the classiest pulp films of recent. I think it got a bad rap from the film industry for ignoring the Batman tie-in. It's an extremely enjoyable movie ride. It has all the elements of revenge, love, regret, etc. (and for love movies I like ""la 'Alante"", so I am no rube). Go for it & you will enjoy it, as we do occasionally. It's a shame that the ""critic industry"" would deprive anyone of the enjoyment this film has to offer."
2,Hmmmmmm,"Well, I rented it for the same reason as any other red-blooded American male....to see Halle Berry in next to nothing. As expected, that was the best part of it. For the most part, the movie itself bored me to death. As a lame bonus, it had that weird, lispy, French guy from the Matrix that I hate. I like comic book/superhore movies as a rule, but this one I could take or leave. Why didn't Halle just be someone like, ""NakedGirl"", or ""Showerwoman""?Ha ha ha, I crack myself up."
1,the worst,If I could give it less than 1 star I would. The only super hero movie I would never buy. The worst plot acting & costumes.
2,non-photo blue pencils,"I have to disagree with the other reviews. Maybe I had a bad batch but these pencils are so hard and so faint that they are utterly impractical. I had to press so hard that I can't tell if it's the blue line I'm seeing or just indentations in the paper from the point of the pencil. I might as well be using a sharp stick. Useless for sketching loose preliminary line for illustration.Going back to the harder-to-find Staedtler non-photo pencils, they may not be quite as invisible to a scanner but at least they're visible to the human eye."
1,Will not buy from this seller again.,"Extremely disappointed with the seller. The seller advertises this product as ""12"" non-photo blue pencils. I received ""1"" in a box that holds 12. I will not purchase from this seller again nor would I advise anyone else to. As for the product, haven't tried ""it"" yet but used something similar when I worked for the government years ago and ""they"" worked very well."
2,BUTCHERING THE PIG'S LEGACY,"I agree with the complaint about missing tracks: whoever rereleased Blodwyn Pig's two studio albs did them (and listeners) a huge disservice by swapping tracks (although this may have actually ""improved"" Getting to This a bit, it ruins Ahead Rings Out). If they had left the original release intact, I'd be giving this at least 4 stars. If you want to hear all of the Pig's best stuff, you'll need to buy both CDs. Too expensive."
5,Simply perfect,"This is the best jazz/blues guitar you will ever hear. I just can't imagine anything being better. If there is something better out there I want to know!!!! Put me onto it. In the meantime, I'll just listen to Midnight Blue over and over again. These guys put you into the groove and never let go. Not one chord is out of place. Is it jazz? Is it blues? Who cares! It's just that good."
5,Need brute force?,"We've had this drill on the job for about 2 months now. Bought it after our Milwaukee RA drill busted while running a self-feed bit. This is one of the most powerful tools I've used. It got away from me, threw me off the roof into a pile of sand, pushed over a huge stone chimney, then spun out into the driveway and crushed a concrete truck, then knocked over a row of porta-potties with guys using them. The crane operator dropped a unit of pan decking on it to get it under control. Make sure to use the side handle!"
4,Solid phone and feature,"If the primary reason you buy a cell phone is to use it as a cell phone (and not for photos, mp3s, text messaging),then this is a rock-solid phone. The operating system and user interface are both good and operate well, the user interface in particular is very user-friendly and intuitive. The photos are fine. It has bluetooth.I dropped it many times, but it still worked fine. Plus it looks very slick too, many people have commented on its cool appearance.The one downside for me is that the phone is a bit heavy. It's not a thin and light Razr."
3,Good features but freezes,"It's bluetooth function works pretty well for me. No additional software is needed to transfer pictures, ring tones with a Windows XP Pro. Worked with my logitech BT headset like a charm. Picture quality and the battery life are average.The biggest problem is the phone freezes from time to time. The first one I got freezed at least onece a day. Then I replaced it. the second one is better, but still freezes about once every week. Hope a new firmware can fix it."
2,a swing and a miss,"It is not a very good cell phone. I actually get to work with dozens of different cell phones every year and this one, as much as I'd like to recommend it because it a US manufacturer and a very well constructed device, is just not very good as a phone. It drops call easily, fails to receive calls reliably, changes ring modes spontaneously, and the operating system is not very pragmatic. For example, the called number history and received call history are each limited to ten numbers, sure it can download and play video wonderfully, but to limit the call history to 10 calls is short-sighted as I personally find that allocation of memory a little more useful. Similarly, the camera is well done, and the bluetooth is a nice feature, but the menu system cannot be navigated with just the directional arrows, expect to have to use no less than 7 buttons while driving to call someone back."
2,A troubling good looking phone,"Pros:1. Good looking design.Cons:1. Randomly freezes. Power off or taking battery out will bring phone back to life.2. Missed calls, rarely though.3. Bluetooth is not stable.4. T-Mobile has sent me 3 replacement phone so far. Each one of those had Cons 1) and 3)."
3,Motorola V600,"I like the phone & the features, it's not as user friendly as I was hoping. I purchased my first one in August, it's now the beginning of Oct. & T-Mobile is sending me a new one because this one is defective...(it won't charge). Hopefully this one holds up better.I love the bluetooth features. That is awesome.Camera and phonebook entry could be a little easier to operate like my E715 was, but guess you can't have everything."
4,Don't be hard of hearing,"I have htis phone and it replaced a Samsung model that I had with Sprint. I am signed up now with Cingular. Why did I buy this phone? The features.Main comments/issuesBluetooth rocks, the volume is terrible (use speakerphone or a headset), phone is not as robust as most so consider an insurance plan or belt clip/case. I cracked the front of mine after a week. It was covered by AMEX but Cingular are not too helpful in this matter. The customer service for Cingular is the same as other companies I have tried, Sprint and Verizon. They are fantastic until you sign up and then they forget you.There are more features on this phoen that I want to use, like teh email option but I can only call CS once a month or else I boil over."
2,"OK, but noticed one big anachronism.","I generally enjoy Ms. McCaffrey's works, but the characterizations in this book didn't live up to her usual excellence.The big anachronism concerns the AIVAS ""turning itself off."" AIVAS doesn't turn itself off until the end of All the Weyrs of Pern. The reason AIVAS isn't available to the second pass Pernese is because it is buried under 20 feet of volcanic ash.Regarding 200 year old computers. Why not? A friend of mine has a 20 year old computer that still works fine. I imagine the Federation of Sentient Planets would have better computers than we have now. Especially as no one complained about AIVAS and the Yokahama still working after more than 2000 Pern years."
4,hardcore dragonlover & mccaffrey fan,"I fell in love with dragon's after reading the Dragonrider's trilogy. This is a must have for any serious fan of this series. Even though there is no outstanding character such as F'lar or Lessa in this book, it truly does bring the history of Pern to life for me. I look for any book from McCaffrey that may have anything at all to do with Pern or my beloved dragons."
2,BORING!!!,"I absolutely love the Pern series, but it's gotten to the point where the author is stuck in a rut and running the same material through over and over and over again.... It's been this long. There has been no thread. Uh oh! Nobody believes it's coming again! Time to persuade some Pernese! This was the first of Anne McCaffery's books that took me two tries to get through. This is definitely a book you WILL be able to put down. Repeatedly."
3,Red Star Rising,I enjoyed this as a fill-in for the history of PERN but my copy is defintely called Red Star Rising not Dragonseye!
5,Absolutely fantastic,"I've been a fan of Anne McCaffrey's for over fifteen years. I've read every book that she has had published. My favorites are the Pern series, this book just follows in a glorious tradition. I'm glad that a lot of questions have been answered; such as the apprentice system they use, it is similar to what we use now but with some signifcant differences. The beginning of the Harpers. A truly great read."

1,Another Poor PPV,This PPV had a weak undercard and the main event with Leno was just plain bad. Do not buy this PPV.
5,Just as promised!,"I got this as a birthday present for my dad. He loves Arizona Highways, and this is the month and year he was born so I thought it appropriate!"
2,"Cute, but little functionality.","I thought this would be ideal for my rack mounted pre-amp (it's only a pre-amp processor and therefore not much heat). You know the little 4"" fan I was using worked better than this unless you crank up the power to 12V (which then causes it to sound like a Cessna. Just buy a small standup fan for under $20, works better, just not as ""cute"". For a power amp or other real heat producing unit, this would be total under-kill."
3,Check your Electrical Boxes!,"Its a good concept, but make sure you have the plastic electrical boxes installed as they are slightly wider and deeper so they can accommodate the ""Hot"" wire installation. If your electrical boxes are metal, forget it, not unless you replace them beforehand."
1,Don't waste your money,I purchased a pack of 4 of these GE night lights to replace a comparable night light that lasted 10 years. Each light - not the bulbs - stopped working after ~3 months. It's sad to see such poor quality coming out of an American company.
2,One -Dimensional,"Dennis Prager is a radio talk show host who, like many of them, speaks before he thinks. He also, apparently, writes before he thinks as well. His good features as a writer are that he can be entertaining and his writing style is basically easy to read. But, he is not an intellectual or a critical thinker because he seeks answers to questions within a very limited framework. Like any fundamentalist, he knows the answer he wants ahead of time. If you want your conservative prejudices confirmed, buy this book. Everyone else--those seeking a real engagement of ideas, a range of thought, or any accuracy or fairness in Prager's depictions of that which he disapproves, should pass."
4,Try reading the book....,"I read this book a few years ago and found it well written, interesting and motivating.And this was before I knew who Dennis Prager was or before I ever heard his radio show. It's rather sad that people can disagree with a person's point of view, philosophy, religion or political position and hide behind an anonymous ""book review"" to make nothing but personal attacks on an author. It's sad, but not surprising - hate is a very strong motivator. These ""hate"" reviewers should try reading his books, they might learn something. Then again, I doubt it."
4,must have text for black identity research!,"Shades of Black begins to address the issues of identity for African Americans. Even though Dr. Cross has revamped his assessment of racial identity for African Americans, his inital theory of nigresence remains and is throughly explained in the book. I would recommend this book to anyone interested or studying African American (Black) Identity. Before we can advance the field, we have to understand the foundations of thought in this area."
4,Buy it in paperback. But buy it!,"I enjoyed this book, despite the Limbaugh and Clancy plugs. I don't understand the ire expressed by my right-of-center fellow readers and reviewers, though. Mills has come up with a unique plot. I look forward to the paperback of Storming Heaven."
4,Good first outing,"This book shows great promise. It has a few problems that are probably due to inexperience, but overall it was very good. I am really looking forward to Kyle's next one"
2,A sophomoric writer comes up with a great plot idea.,"Now I aint no pretentious book reviewer, but even an idiot like me can recognize poor character development and lazily researched settings. Take for example that scene where the characters go out in the ""desert"" around Houston, Tx. I used to live in Houston. Did that area turn into a desert since I left in 1990? I realize that when one is reading fiction, one does a certain amount of reality suspension, but when I came to that Houston desert scene, I was nearly disgusted enough to throw the book against the wall. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the plot. I know this may seem like a trivial complaint, especially to someone not familiar with the topography of Texas, but hey you Phoenicians, how would you like it if you were reading a novel and the author wrote: ""Kirby climbed to the top of Camelback Mountain and squinted into the glint coming off the Pacific Ocean."""
1,Lots of words- little on creating correspondance art,"This is an extremely thin little book. The largest portion of the book is narrative, history, philosophy, ""he said"" and ""she said"". Color plates are included almost as an afterthought - very few of the illustrations bore any obvious relationship to creating correspondance art. Not useful in my fairly large library, returned the book."
4,Introspective Live Album,"I've owned this cd since it first came out. This album has some serious flaws to it. There's a HUGE continuity error about halfway through disc 1 where the song just inexplicably fades out. Then like 5 seconds of silence followed by it jumping into the next song.THIS, my friends, is the nature of live Mississippi blues though. Pinetop Perkins on the piano has never sounded better live. And Louis Myers REALLY does well playing Middy's old leads for like 2 hours straight.Mojo Buford is a serviceable harmonica player but MAYBE a top 5ish in Muddy history. I've never even heard of the bass player & drummer on this and they fall into their own thing in spots that I don't care for.That being said it's in spots & doesn't destroy the album for me.Where THIS album picks up steam is in the song selections. Pee Wee Clayton & Jimmy Reed covers? OKAY!"
5,perfect and on time,"The book arrived on time and in perfect condition - as advertised. We chose this book for our group Bible study, and it's going to be great!"
3,disturbing,"I give this book 3 stars out of 5. I feel that when Jeff comes home is not a very good book. It's not a book that you would really want to read unless you're interested in disturbing stories. This story is about a young boy who gets kidnapped by a sick man about in his 40's and takes him away from his family for two whole years and rapes him many times until Jeff got used to it, let him and went along with it. I think it's a really sad story and I think it's horrible that real life is like that but then again it is so this could be a story you would want to read to learn about things that go on maybe in your own neighborhood."
1,YUCK!,"I am astonished at the previous reviews of this supposedly teen novel. I found it disturbing and without much merit. It seems the author's only goal is to desensitize to the subject of abduction and sexual molestation. I know young adults (12+) are more worldly than in the past, but what benefit is this story? If the intent is to scare, prehaps it succeeds at that, but a good story---YUCK!"
2,A Disturbing Book,"When Jeff Comes Home is a very disturbing book. How anyone could write about a MAN raping a kid BOY is disgusting. I felt uneasy throughout the whole book and was shocked that Jeff partly like being raped by the same sex. He never said that, but he thought about it and covered for Ray, and did actions he did with Ray. I do not recommend this book, but if you are going to read it, be prepared and emotionally ready. If you are under 14, you probably shouldn't read it. This is an appalling book."
3,Just what was needed,A reference work that is invaluable when information needed to determine the value of a book in the secondary market. Quite useful although now somewhat out of date. An undated version will be equally useful when and if it appears.Very helpful to find on Amazon since not likely to be available in the bookstore otherwise.
4,Another Nokia 770 OK,Works. Works well. Doesn't seem to make the Nokia battery drain any faster that the 512 dual-voltage chip that I bought for a couple dollars more than this one. I reccommend it if your machine is compatible with it.
1,Disappointing,"While Motoviloff's book promised to offer insight and wisdom on the unique natural beauty of the Driftless region, it ended up failing in the end. The author claims to understand the area's inhabitants, both human and animal, and the ecosystem they share. However, he also feels the region's natural resources are at his disposal. The entire book, which perhaps might have discussed the delicate balance of plants and animals, consists entirely of hunting and fishing stories, and poorly written ones at that. The book lacks a plot, or even a hint of excitement. It stirred only disgust at his total lack of respect for the land. Motoviloff, who only vacations in the Driftless region, lacks the experience and knowledge that only years of living in the region can give. The region doesn't need another man to harvest its fish or kill its wild game. It needs a conservationist who understands the land and respects it."
4,It'll do,We used this book in conjunction with the SPSS manual and software. Even though this book did disappoint at times (what text book doesn't really) it did prove useful as a reference book and supplemented the SPSS manual nicely.
1,Discovering Art and Culture - The New Zealand Maori,"A dissapointing viewing experience given that I am a New Zealander. The script was too narrowily focused, a more experienced commentator would have helped and the twenty minute duration of the dvd was far too short. It was not 'value for money' by any means and I would not recomend this dvd. Dennis Hulse"
5,Essential reading,"... This book is a classic, or will be. So what if the author made up a word here or there -- he's not the first. ""Above the Forest"" is an ethnography in the classical sense of one. Unlike Radcliffe-Brown, Pandya actually lived with the Ongees for over a year. His description of the shaman's journey is intriguing and detailed. I'm a lay reader and I found this book both fascinating and engrossing. I'd recommend it. It's the best thing going on the Andamans."
3,Very good - but often old - non-digital era - point of view,"Solid, very good standard info. However, you recognize that the basic concept of this book was written long time ago..."
1,Near false advertisement,"To whom this may concern:Here is a summary of my recent experience:1) This product shows in your listing more than 4 times under slightly different tittles and prices which cause me to pay the higher price2) Even though the name is the same and besides having consulted with the distributor to ensure the fragance was the same, the fragance i received was not the same it was rather disgusting3) Your support person in India is trained to say yes to everything so with the intention to apeace the customer..? come on thas a worst insult4) and so on....."
3,Not as good as it looks,I bough it for the programmable key which work well. my problom starts when I try and type anything. No matter how hard or soft I push the keys they dont always work right an thats a problom to me.
5,"Everything I needed, and more.","I was more than pleased with this LCD keyboard. Installation was easy and it's worked perfectly since then. Compatible with Windows 64 bit was a big plus! The keys aren't very quite, but I like the feel.It has G1-18 keys for macros, can set them 3 times for a total of 54 shortcut keys/macros. This is perfect for online gaming. The LCD display automatically picks up and games or programs installed that it can use. Very easy to change the settings as well.Great keyboard, but probably a bit much unless you are in need for all the shortcut keys, 2x usb ports or the LCD screen."
5,Big Bang for the Buck!!!,"I am an Engineer by profession and do alot of drafting and design every day in my line of work. This keyboard is far and away, the best programmable keyboard I've ever used for the price. Don't let the gaming designation fool you into thinking it's just for gaming. On the contrary, it is highly versatile and can be programmed to work with just about any executable program. It's 3 banks of 6 G-keys easily shifted over 3 memory stations gives you an extra 54 programmable key functions in addition to the F-keys. Macro's are easily created with the enclosed software and the media keys are a very cool and convenient feature. This G-15 is actually, in my opinion, better than the newest Logitech G-15 keyboard because it gives the user more programmable functionality. The only negative that I have found so far is that the keys are a little noisy and springy sounding. Also, the included plastic palm-rest is cheezy and should be thrown away."
2,Would Not Recommend,Bought this keyboard for my gaming husband and we discovered that it caused numerous games to freeze and just didn't work as expected. We now have an oversized paper weight on our hands. I would not recommend this to anybody.
3,Its Okay a little bulky,"This a nice keyboard but it is a little bulky and large, I like some tilt to my keyboard and there is not much with this keyboard, the macro keys are nice and the software is good, the keys seam a little tight too, if you are a gamer I would consider the Saitec keyboards, I had one before this one and I like it much better.CB"
5,Useful Keyboard,This keyboard is very useful. I love the LCD Panel that shows me stats as well as ram usage and so forth. I absolutely adore the usb slots for inserting temporary usb items like thumb drives and my SD card reader.I love the way this board clicks. Yes I am one of those oddballs who can not live with a Keyboard that does not click right under their fingers. This one feels nice and sounds nice. The fact that the keys light up nicely make it easier to use. That impressed my Dad once he realized it was supposed to do that.It is fairly sturdy and stable. It has held up through minor spills. Right now it desperately needs to be cleaned but it is still working great.
5,"Light, Enjoyable, Heyer at her best.","Just finished, and I'm sad that it's over. A delightful story with unexpected characters and surprising little twists. The leading couple's romance is one you probably haven't quite read before. And for most romance-readers, that's uncommon. Georgette Heyer exercises her talent of whisking us away to London in the time of Jane Austen. As always, her descriptions of customs, costumes, and intricate family politics are fun to read and hard to put down. I recommend this for any fan of Regency Romance."
4,"Fun Historical, but not really all that romancy","This is my first Georgette Heyer novel. I had a hard time getting into it. The first quarter of the book is rather slow and dull. However, once into the story, I found it very quirky and fun. I did not find it to be a romance though. Freddy and Kitty don't have much spark. And although I realize that this was not the intent of the author, I kept waiting for Freddy to come out of the closet. At the very least he is a metrosexual. I like my heroes a little less interested in female clothing and style.But if I look past the idea of this book as a romance, I enjoyed it. The banter is great. The characters are hilarious. I would definitely recommend it."
1,Not really a stylus.,"This stylus does not work on iPhones or iPads. It is just a hard plastic tip on a pen. I'm sure it works on something, just not apple products. The size of the pen is too small for my hand and the cap does not stay on well, to make it longer and fit better."
2,maybe I'm just not into Zen,"I didn't read through this book in its entirety simply because of its repetitiveness and inner-contradictions. I don't particularly agree with Buddhism and that sort of thing and this book definitely reflected my distaste for it. However if you think that 'emptiness is form, and form is emptiness' and that sort of nonsense, you might like this. According to Zen Therapy, we are all just walking molecules without souls. just FYI"
4,Another From Their Classic Period,"Although not as great as Thank Christ For The Bomb or Split, Hogwash is still a fine album from McPhee and Co.'s best years. Clive Brooks (formerly of Egg) replaces Ken Pustelnik on the drums for this one. McPhee at this point is incorporating the mellotron heavily in the music as well as synth, a departure from the basic power trio sound of the earlier records. I've read that he got into keys while recovering from a broken arm (fell off the stage during an American concert). Some of the mellotron bits remind me of things that Zeppelin would incorporate a few years down the line. Were they listening to this (especially John Paul Jones)? A few songs go on a little too long without going anywhere, especially ""3744 James Road"" despite some cool riffs in the process."
5,Taking Gay Literature to the next level!,"POWERFUL is the way I sum up this book. E. Xavier has the ability to take a story and let you see life through the eyes of an innocent boy that has been thrown into inevitable turmoil. Fending for himself through life's unpredictable twists and turns, the journey of Mikey takes place, where fate had already been set since the day of his birth. This is a story that definitely cuts to the chase, and uncovers life's uneasy journey for gay, latino youths. Through the rough areas of New York, you are taken on a rollercoaster ride as Mikey sets out to find true love, as well as forced to deal with his past pains. This is definitely a book that accurately depicts the lifestyle that a gay latino is forced to deal with. Thank you for opening the doors to The House Of Xavier."
2,Rather Disappointing Given The Attempted Hype,"I wanted to like this book. I hoped to find an exciting new voice from the gay latino population. Heaven knows we need one... Sadly, Xavier isn't it, yet..... He is rather like an unschooled racehorse. There is a lot of talent and originality there - that is obvious - but he needs a decent editor to clean up his writing. I suspect he won't find the help he needs at a small publisher lacking decent editors. He needs to move to a bigger house, or he ought to consider going to one of the better writing programs - Iowa, for example - where under someone's wing his raw talent could be developed."
2,"Good information, terrible presentation","As a psychology minor, I think Matlin does a wonderfully thorough job of covering cognition. However, as an English major, I find her style of writing irritatingly repetitive, and much more confusing than it needs to be. She uses a lot of examples to define concepts, rather than stating them--which would be very helpful. Furthermore, the glossary does absolutely nothing to help the confused student, since it basically reprints the in-text sentence where the vocabulary word appears. I would recommend sending the book to a literary editor who could redo the text."
5,Best information available!,"There is no way for anyone to list all the waterfalls in North Carolina, but this book does give very complete information on the falls that are accessible to most people. The directions are clear and the ratings are very helpful. Even if you consider yourself to be an adequate photographer, this book gives specific hints for the different locations. I have used and enjoyed the public library copy so much I finally bought it!"
2,acai berry 500 mg caps,I have been told by other relatives that this products works. So far my husband and I have noticed little or no effect. Will not purchase again.
3,Still waiting,My mother uses philosophy products and said they are great and I needed some new face products so I thought I would try this. I have combination skin that maybe breaks out just a little bit every now and again. This product is suppose to be for congested skin and yet I see no change in my skin yet. Maybe I need to use it longer; it's been about 2-3 weeks. I think it would be better if the cleanser had the micro beads in it to feel like my skin was getting clean.
5,Nosferatu Review,"Excellent 1922 silent horror film, classic storyline, great character plot, and the sepia color added a nice touch to it. I would recommend this to anyone who likes horror or has an interest/appreciation for good film. Though it is old, it is very well done for it's time. Nosferatu beats any new age 'dracula' story, it doesn't focus on fashion nor trend. It simply is what it is."
2,Does not rock!!!,"I love the movie, but the music does not live up to gothic industrial. It was very quiet and repetitive. A few times it started to build, but then nothing.My wife and I are so frustrated by this DVD soundtrack that we are going to make our own REAL gothic industrila soundtrack using tracks from Type O negative, Ministry, BauHaus, NIN, even King Diamond and Danzig!Don't waste your money. Buy the cheap Nosferatu with the old soundtrack."
5,Great Choice!!,"I bought this after reading the reveiws and found that the price was very good. I read is some reveiws of people getting white ones instead of black, but this did not concern me because i just wanted a good product. When the stand came in it was black so, they might have change the mix up for the ones that got white ones thinking it was going to be black."
2,Dissapointed,"This is a poorly made product and it is not worth the price. I wasn't expecting much as I know djs tend to shell out a good $75-$100 on a laptop stand, but I feel that I got less than what I paid for. This is very rickety and will bend easily. It wobbles quite a bit even if you have it set to lower heights where there is more overlap of the metal and therefore more reinforcement. I would not recommend this product unless you are on a super tight budget and feel you need one. I don't think I will return it as I have nothing to replace it with at this point. Also my laptop almost just fell out of it which inspired me to get on here and write this review. I had to catch it, the front of the stand has barely high enough lips to hold my laptop. (I have an acer aspire 5250)"
2,Total bore,"This book was a total bore. I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't a book filled with bad pictures of flower arrangements that look almost identical (and on top of that there are hardly any pictures in the book). What is colonial flower arranging? Don't expect this book to tell you."
5,A gem,"This is a wonderful book of teachings and reflections. Ajahn Sumedho's perspective seems somehow fresh (after all these years of Buddhist commentary). I found Mind and the Way down to earth and accessible, yet very much undiluted. It's definitely written from a monk's perspective, but most of the material is inspiring and useful for the laity too. This is clearly a man who walks (and sits) his talk."
4,Shazam Finally Looks Like A Hero One Can Enjoy,"I have never been a Captian Marvel (Shazam) fan. I always considered him to be a silly excuse for a superhero. Most of the stories introduced were shallow. Character development always lacked and the art work never matured. That has ended with Ross' outstanding portrayal.Dinni (writer) and Ross (artist) have made an enjoyable and interesting story in their third special installment of the DC comic hero's (Superman and Batman are the others). Ross' 50's film noir look is a perfect fit for this sometimes overly wholesome charachter.Marvel deals with saving a city from a volcana, stopping some ""bad men"" and confronting an abusive father. A good collecter's item."
3,Not That Funny,I LUV Jamie Foxx but this just wasn't that funny. Cursing a lot in a comedic routine does not a funny routine make.
2,Disappointing,"I really love Jamie and I love to laugh and I don't mind crude or rude jokes, but I'm not all the way through this tape yet, and I can think of a million other things to watch or do before I finish this. I can't understand that someone needs to feel funny by using the 'f' word in each and every sentance. After a while it's no longer funny (if at all) and it becomes really annoying. Like I said, he's great usually, but this just didn't do it for me. Sorry Jamie"
1,Boring DVD!,"I do not own this DVD,but I did watch this on HBO,and I was not impressed.The part about Jennifer Lopez is very stupid.Also,his routine about Africa is very boring.If you want to hear a good routine about Africa,watch Richard Pryor's ""Live On The Sunset Strip.That routine and movie is hilarious.The worst thing about this DVD is that almost all of the jokes are all about security issues.I don't mind jokes like this,but these tend to get old fast.If you want to hear some good security jokes,watch either of Chris Rock's DVD's.He is the greatest comedian ever.So whatever you do,steer clear of either Jamie Foxx DVD.He is not funny."
4,Good stuff!,"Muse sounds like a cross between Radiohead, Catherine Wheel, and Jeff Buckley. Sometimes they sound a bit too much like their influences, but, over all, this album rocks!"
5,Incredible,"This album is wonderful! I listen to it constantly and have never liked a group more. Every song is very good, and I just can't stop listening to it. If anyone has any doubts on whether or not to buy it....go for it. It was well worth it. My favorite album!"
1,Absolute Rubbish! Thom Yorke must be laughing at them!,"I'm sorry, I bought this on the recommendation of a mate who says it's like Radiohead, but slightly different. This album stinks! Thom Yorke's tribute band have officially landed! Why can't bands be original anymore? Radiohead are the best at being Radiohead, Radiohead are best at being Muse."
3,"Good album, but check out Origin of Symmetry.","Showbiz is more of a showcase of Muse's roots. The influences of both Nirvana and Radiohead are quite obvious, and detract a little from the songs if you are familiar with those bands. However, the raw talent of the trio is the album's saving grace.Matt Bellamy uses his voice to great effect, and although his falsetto is cause for many of the Radiohead comparisons, he produces an intensity which is quite different to Thom Yorke's subtly crafted vocals. Not a classic, but definitely an album which most bands would kill to produce."
3,a good first effort,"These guys are flat out good song writers; they just need to grow up alittle. The songs are well writen but sometimes poorly executed. Matt's wheezing between words is enough for some people to throw the disc out of the window of a moving car. Minus the wheezing and gasping, he has a really good voice and an impressive range. I find hope in the fact that these guys are young and this is a debut. With a few more seasons under their belts, these guys could write world class music. As far as radiohead comparisons, you must not of really listened to RH much beyond creep and iron lung if you think this band is even worhty of such a lofty comparison. As far as Muse's songs beeing more CREATIVE then Radiohead, that's the most rediculous thing I have ever heard."
3,Muse live,"All this comparisons between Muse and Radiohead are boring me as possible! Muse music sound a little like Radiohead's, and so. personnaly, some of Muse guitar sound remind me a french rock group: Noir Désir, but i don't try to find if they are better or worse because somehow they are different. This band has a very good potential, but it needs a little time to really find its own way. French people has the chance to have seen them live, in a TV program: Nulle Part Ailleurs,that's the first time i heard them, and believe me, they were amazing!so much that i was a little desappointed by the CD. They were totally in their music and the public was hang on matt's guitar. Some thing has happend this day that makes me say that Muse could be one of the greatest rock group of the next years if they take the good turn."
3,Showbiz - Somewhat of a let down,"Compared to Muse's other CDs (Origin of Symmetry/Absolution) this CD is somewhat of a let down. It does contain a few songs that are really good, but the rest of the CD does not meet up with the standards I expect from Muse. Muse is one of the great bands to come out of England, and most of their music is fantastic, but this CD is just not their best work."
2,flashlight combo kit,"I purchased this years ago, and still have the items today. After only like 5 months the batterys went very weak, to the point where the drill would not even work from the batterys. Since then ive been stuck using the flashlilght only, which is dull due to the weak batterys. A pair of batterys for this was about 75 percent of the cost of a new unit, so i opted not to purchase them. I should have tried to warranty them, but did not. I feel its possibly the ni-mh batterys that were the problem as opposed to the ni-cads. Possibly they have more of a memory. Overall nice tools, good power, but if the batterys are junk, and they are over 70 percent of the cost of a new kit, then you are left with un-needed tools when you end up buying another drill/flashlight kit."
5,You Know You're Hooked...,"... when you can't put a book down. This excellently-written and expertly paced story is one of those. A vast array of characters are introduced as the plot twists and turns (most importantly) in unpredictable directions. And although the story resolves itself so as not to leave the reader hanging, it definitely sets the stage for a sequel. Soon, I hope."
3,"Finding Led Zep in here is like playing ""Where's Waldo?""...","This album is often touted as being worthwhile because of the inclusion of members of Led Zeppelin. While indeed they do show up here and there, their influence is never really felt. Rather, this is a rambling stylistic piece that displays lack of direction more than broad range. While there are some beautiful and/or catchy tunes, the production is weak. The title song sounds like something Kinky Friedman got his inspiration from. By the time of this album, PJ had spent most of the money made in his early success as a hot performer on the Shindig! show. He apparently was disappointed that Tom Jones succeeded by borrowing PJ's own stylistic approach. A good artist, better appreciated by his earlier more pop-oriented efforts. One of many performers who just never could move along with changing music styles in the later 60's."
3,Norah Lofts takes on Isabella of Spain,"This is not Lofts's best book, but her writing talents are so incredible I found myself faulting Isabella for not leading a more dramatically satisfying life. Anything by Lofts is worth a read for her uncanny ability to get into the minds of her subjects."
5,Love this!!!,"I bought this directly from Children's Factory and I have to say, this set is WONDERFUL and well worth every penny I paid for it. My kids LOVE it and it's VERY well made. This thing can hold up to whatever my kids decide to do- and my favorite feature is that it is held together by Velcro. Unlike other sets this one can't come apart as they climb on it. I highly recommend it."
3,Disc was defective.,"The product (ordered from Planet Bollywood)Om Shanti Om [Blu-ray] was defective. Absolutely none of the special features on the blu-ray disc were accessible. The film itself was only ""ok,"" in that it was a fairly flimsy story line that took way too long to tell (it could have been conveyed in about 10 or 15 minutes). The technical quality of the blu-ray film was quite good, but you have to have lightning fast ability to follow the subtitles, as they are white and frequently invisible against the lighter colored scenes. They also go by at super-fast speed! It would have been nice to have been able to view the extras, but alas! none are accessible (or they simply are NOT on the disc, although listed on the back side of the cover)."
4,Excellent reference book,I found this textbook to be invaluable as I prepared to make an academic prsentation on nutrition and cancer.
4,The Missing Bronte Link,"I must say that despite my qualms about some of the author's ""politics,"" not to mention his barely-simmering-below-the-surface rage toward ""modern, independent"" women, I'm still so taken with the prose style and the very loveable character of Emily that I've read 180 pp and am almost sad to be coming to the end.And to be fair, Collier manages to skewer the entire leisure class- though he does reserve his sharpest barbs for the women."
2,Toy not designed for lefties,"I bought this toy for my two year old, not realizing it is not designed for lefties. The handle is hard for me to turn and would be difficult for any child. This toy is not what I thought it would be."
1,Alex Bubble Mixer bathtoy,Just not worth it. I made an incorrect assumption that the soap would slowly come out as handle was turned. Any soap you pour in immediately comes right back out. Better off just using good old plastic cups and spoons.
3,Smell No More!,"Onion Keeper definitely holds all the odor in of your worst offending onion. Downside, it will only accomodate half and onion (which is mainly what the use is for) and the overall design does not allow it to be stored in a practical way (small glass bottom, big round top. a rounded square might have made it more appealing). But it does the job as far as keeping in the onion smell so overall, happy with the purchase."
1,Nothing to learn,"The discription of this book sounds good. It will make you think that you are going to learn from this book. In reality, you must have the audio tapes or the book is useless. I can't find the tapes to purchase."
2,Good reference but a poor teacher!,This book is a good reference book if you are already transcribing. It is useless as a teaching tool without the audio tapes. The audio tapes are expensive for 6 - 90 minute tapes and must be ordered from Delmar Publishers. Unless you are enrolled in a class and have the tapes available from your school I would not recommend this book for beginners.
5,Given as a gift,This was given as a Christmas gift. She couldn't find it in stores and was happy when she got it.
3,"geared for ""reproductively challenged"" OR 40+ woman","Pros: very informativeCons: too informativeMy partner called this the ""bad book"" because it scared me. Did not enjoy the writer's tone-scare tactic like.Was deciding between RACHEL PEPPER'S book and this...choose this one based upon the number of pages (like more pages would make me a better educated mother on this subject).I was WRONG.Since then I have ordered RACHEL PEPPER'S ""Ultimate Guide""LOVE IT!She has a more relaxed feeling throughoutI found the snip-its of Real Stories from different lesbians & their experiences in every step of the conception process to be almost like a support group feel-encouraging you through this exciting journey."
2,Not Great,"This book is very anti western medicine an pits you against your doctor or the fertility clinic from the onset It advises not to get most of medical testing. For example, it says you don't need blood tests or ultra sounds in the first 12 weeks, because nothing can prevent a miscarriage. (Early testing does detect things like an ectopic pregnancy which if untreated can be fatal). I understand the backlash against doctors, but in this case, it is extreme, unnecessary, and harmful to the process of getting pregnant."
5,The Five Little Peppers and How they Grew,"I last read this book when I was 8 years old. It is the story of a loving,caring family,with Polly, the oldest child setting a loving example of selflessness and caring for her sisters and brother and family members. The book chronicles a life of hardship and deprivation to eventual luxury for all. I'm quite a bit older now, but the book left a tremendous impact about how caring for each other is life's ultimate reward."
5,"Adorable, a real treat!","I'm a Southerner who read this during a cold northern spring. It was such a treat, the perfect antidote to the gray skies outside. Warm, funny, and friendly. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to smile at the end of a tough day."
4,The enlightening life experience of ONE Somali girl-child,"I read this book because I am studying Psychology and it is the focus of a personality assessment piece I am to present. I found 'Aman' to be an easy read, but a pleasurable one. For those who choose to criticise her story, I would put to you that Aman did not presume to explain her story as that of EVERY Somali woman, but of her own life experience. Furthermore, I have been educated in the fact that not EVERY Somali woman is as dependent on her husband as I once presumed. I thank Aman for teaching ME a thing or two."
2,"Started good, but trailed off by midway","I have worked quite a bit with Somali refugees, and have established friendships with several individuals. I picked this book up in hopes of understanding more about the background of the older individuals I encounter (same ""age"" as Aman). The first third of the book I really enjoyed, and I think, learned much from. From that point onward, it seems to become less and less representative of ""the general"" experience or ""a typical"" experience. Though I cruised through the first part, by midpoint my interest was dropping off quickly, and I had to convince myself to finish it. If this is one of the better books to read about Somalia or Somalis, it is only because there are so few contenders."
3,A Good First Look at Changes in Japan's past 60 Years,"The book provides a first look at changes in Japan's past 60 years, focusing on the situation of the country's soul at the end of 2002. Personally, I think the author was a bit negative about the future prospects of Japan, emphasazing the problems of families and education. Even if things are changing in Japan, the country, on my view, is still the most accountable in the World. For people who wants to understand the country and how it became what it is now, the book is a good start, providing a solid beggining from which further reading should follow."
2,Like a Rehearsal,"The performance on this CD is really really unpolished. John Lee loosely meanders through the songs on this CD. He does hit stride at times - especially on Dazie Mae, but overall the band (drums, Bass and Hooker) are just too laid back and sloppy. I love John Lee Hookers' music but this CD is hard to listen too."
2,the title sounds much better than the actual book,"I was very disappointed when I received this book. First of all it is totally outdated. Secondly it is thin and not as comprehensive as the title makes it out to be. Yes, the author touches the topics, but somehow the title sounds much better than the actual book."
3,"Boook about Circuits Design, rather than Microelectronic","This book is required textbook in our EECS Department, however, I turned out reading Millman's Electronics to finish the course. You do learn some trick or say arts regarding circuit design, but not principles of microelectronic. If you're good at circuit analysis, you would wonder why memorize so many models/formulas which are easy to draw out(probably only good for examination, as you might have no time to do the jobs)? Instead of understanding the physics/limitation of devices and apply your knowledge form circuit analysis?! It's better for you to learn circuit theory/microelectroinc separately and then dip into advanced book, like Gray's Analog design, for consolidation."
3,A very bumpy ride for a beginner,"I have tried my best to use this book as my primary textbook for introductory electronics. Unfortunately, my frustration with this book is still about the same. Every chapter or section starts out very clearly and seems to make perfect sense. But all of a sudden an avalanche of new information follwos in the form of (step-by-step)analysis and (tips) that no beginner student can possibly find intuitive. I got somethings out of this book, but only the very basic concepts. Advanced concepts are not covered with the biginner student in mind. Recently, I have come across the book by P.R. Gray and R.G. Meyer. Supposedly that is a higer level book than Sedra's. But it actually makes much more sense to me than ""Microelectronic Circuits"". I think it's much more structured,and geared toward developing the true understanding that a designer needs. I still use Sedra's book as a reference, however, every now and then."
1,mediocre title,"This book does a good job covering the basics of transistor operation and basic amplifier configurations. There are a few other sections which are done well, but beyond that, the text is not a very pleasant read. Not enough examples is one issue. Some topics, such as oscillators, are only briefly covered, without any particular worked examples. Sometimes authors state that they are making an assumption, but fail to provide reasoning.In short, this one is ok for beginners, and it does it's job half decently, but I wouldn't recommend this as a reference, since it's not in depth and explanations are lacking in many places."
4,Exam Krackers Complete Study guide,"Im from Australia and brought the exam kracker books to study for the gamsat. So far I have read through each book and I must say that I am impressed with the quality of these books. Not only do they provide straightforward explanations but they also provide an effective approach to learning all this stuff. I recommend these books to those who have had some prior science background, as some of the explanations are not enough to fully understand concepts. A textbook may come in handy. 4.5 stars"
4,Comprehensive Review of MCAT Science,"As an Australian doing a very similar medical admissions test, I found these books pretty comprehensive in their review of necessary science knowledge. In fact sometimes they were too detailed (e.g. the non-organic chemistry went into some unnecessary detail)!The diagrams are A1 quality and text well-written.Notwithstanding the above I wouldn't say that the humanities parts of the exam are covered well so don't buy the package thinking it'll be everything you need to score well on the MCAT."
4,Service from Amazon.com,Quick delivery when I purchased directly from Amazon.com. I ordered the books on January 25 and they arrived January 30. Haven't taken a real good look at the content but so far I love the color illustrations and text-book like paper quality.
3,Night Rider,"Percy Munn, a young lawyer and tobacco farmer in Kentucky, becomes a powerful member of The Association - a group of farmers who band together in an effort to break the economic monopoly of the big tobacco companies. It's not an easy fight, and soon The Association is acting like the KKK, coercing farmers into doing their bidding, resorting to violence if necessary. Munn's morals disappear. Warren explores this dilemma of a good man doing bad things for a good cause and the effect it has on his life pretty well. It's a powerful work in spots, especially in Warren's use of dialogue, but finally the story, and the book itself, seems too long and drawn out. A decent first novel, but Warren would do better work later on."
2,"Their weakest, but understandably.","Understandably, because this is a collection of non album / early singles. Most of which are severely hampered by lo-fi, muddled sound. For completists only.Not to be compared with the superb ""This Is What We Call Progress"" or the 'good' ""If we Should Meet In The Future""...I don't know where these guys went, but I wish they'd come back with a killer!"
5,books,looking for touch and feel books to use with my SMH students found and ordered several here from this sellergreat pricebooks were in great shapewill order again from them soon
1,BOSS AUDIO BV7950 IN DASH,"TOOK ABOUT 6MO. FOR SOMEONE TO INSTALL IT IN MY SON'S TRUCK AFTERTHAT, IT ONLY LASTED 20 DAYS. TOTALLY DOESNT WORK."
1,No Rebate !,I bought this item becouse of the rebate. But there is no way to fined out how to get it.
1,You get what you pay for,I can see why these CD's are so [inexpensive]. They won't burn anything faster than 12x on my computer. Don't be fooled. You are basically buying slower CD's so of course they are going to be [inexpensive].
2,over hyped,"Schematic and poorly resolved. Details, situations and descriptions largely uninteresting. Seems the work of an epigone. Disappointing after all the build-up."
5,Best of the best,"This remains my favorite Bolano novel. While it lacks the heft and cumulative impact of 2666, the plot is clearer and the events more telling. Instead of the thousands of murders that actually happened in both cases (Chile and Ciudad Juarez), here he focuses on a few specific crimes, which retain their nauseating horror. Also, here we have an actual villain, which helps bring the evil of a corrupt system into focus. How to choose between poetry written in the sky by a military pilot and a book hung on the line like so much laundry? Bolano may have been the most fertile author on earth while he lived, and we are lucky to have all of his books. But for me, this one delivers the more powerful, sublime, and terrifying read."
5,This option is worth it.,Holley 534-54 Digital Pro-Jection Throttle Body Injection Closed Loop KitGet this if you are installing the Holley Pro Injection unit for converting a 2 bbl carb auto. It will make dialing in the elctronic unit mush easier ... and... likely will increase fuel mileage
4,Another nice accessory,"The only negative I have is it is just a little to short. Any project over 8"" and this just is too short."
2,"My favorite Calvert album has been butchered ""sweetly"".","Although this is my favorite Calvert album, I can only lament this release of a heavily ""sweetened"" version of the vinyl LP. Fully half of the tracks have been augmented with additional background vocals, synthesisers, and effects. Worst offense? The original vocal recitation of ""The Making of Midgard"" has been turned into a sort of ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat"" rounder, totally obliterating Calvert's eerie presence. What a shame. To whomever is responsible, may Muspelsheim grind your bones."
3,Robert Calvert - 'Lucky Leif&The Longships' (Beat Goes On),"Another concept lp reissue from Robert Calvert,originally put out in 1975.'Lucky Leif...' was the follow up to 'Captain Lockheed...' and not QUITE as good either.It's alight.Perhaps a tad to 'out there' for some.The best tunes are ""Magic Potion"" and ""Ragna Rock"".I've heard others comment that this'd be a great CD to trip on.Calvert's backing players here are Nik Turner,Pink Fairies bassist Paul Rudolph,Simon House and Sci-Fi author Mike Moorcock.A decent title to pull out to listen to during a slow weekend."
1,Stained page,Very disappointed with a major stain on the first page of the book. This is NOT new as was advertised.
2,Started off good...,"The only previous work of Strieber's I had read was ""Communion"" 20 years ago. Truly spine tingling.""The Grays"" seems to be a fictional account of something Mr. Strieber himself had gone through, but on a grander scale.The story starts off really well and is definitely a page-turner, but after a while, it just seems to fall flat. The ending is rather ambiguous and quite a letdown. By the time all is said and done, the reader doesn't really seem to care what has happened or what will happen to the characters of the story.The book also seems to be a sermon disguised as a work of fiction by Mr. Strieber as to what HE believes these ""aliens"" to be and why they are here (if, indeed they are even here at all - I am a true skeptic).All I can say is that I read a lot. When I finish one book, I pick up another. If a book is good, I may read twice more. If it's REALLY good, I will read it once a year or so. ""The Grays"", however, I read once and will probably not read it again ever."
4,Check the contents. Do you really need a COMPLETE set!,"'The Complete, Fully Illustrated Works, Deluxe Edition' of lewis Carroll's works may actually be more than you really want. While three of Carroll's works, the two Alice fantasy novels and the long poem, 'The Hunting of the Snark' are major classics of English literature, Carroll wrote an equal or greater amount of pretty dull stuff, primarily the two 'Sylvia and Bruno' novels, which I have never been able to finish.My suggestion to all but the Carroll scholar and people who want to see his logical works is to buy the annotated versions of the two Alice novels and the annotated 'Snark', all annotated by Martin Gardiner. This way, you are also guaranteed of getting Henry Holiday's illustrations for 'The Hunting of the Snark', which are not in all 'Complete' collections."
5,Starting to Learn Mandarin Chinese.,"New Practical Chinese Reader 1 is great for both beginner and intermediate students that are learning Mandarin Chinese. It also helps professional speakers to keep up with learning and remembering characters and how to write sentences. I remember a good portion of the material in the book, but there is nothing wrong with constant practice and looking over books. I recommend this book for those that want to learn Chinese either out of interest in the culture or because of business opportunity reasons."
1,Just atrocious,"Ok, first of all, this cd really gets 5 stars. I just gave it 1 star cause no one ever reads the good reviews. Second, I'm actually 16 years old. Anyways, this cd is listenable all the way through. The songs are either OK or outstanding. Highlights are Dirty Boots, Mary Christ, and Titanium Expose. The rest of the cd pretty much kicks, but sometimes it loses steam, or just gets to involved with the whole noise rock thing and it detracts from the quality of the song(Mote is 7 minutes long, and the last four minutes of it is noise.) However, this release will not leave you disappointed. Oustanding instrumentation, great hooks, and interesting lyrics prevail through most of the cd. If you are a fan of indie rock or avant-garde punk rock, I suggest you pick this up."
3,Maybe 2.75 stars.,"The songs, as others have noticed, sound a lot alike. A bigger problem than that is that the similar sound running through them isn't that great. It's pretty good, but not enough to sit through for a whole album. Dirty Boots is wonderful, Mary-Christ and Kool Thing are fun, Mote (the Lee song) is good, Tunic is depressing which isn't always bad, and the rest are either OK or forgettable and run together in my memory."
5,Sonic Youth's Best!!,"And my favorite album of theirs, every song is great! I would call it ""Daydream Nation II"". It's a masterpiece with some of their best guitar work. From the transcendental opening riffs of 'Dirty Boots' to the beautifully droning feedback epilogue of 'Titanium Expose'. A 90s alt/rock classic! Favorite Songs: Dirty Boots, Mildred Pierce, Mote, Kool Thing, Titanium Expose"
1,Not for beginners,"This book is not for beginners. Very confusing and poorly written.I don't know if it makes a good reference because I'm new to Photoshop, but I do know one thing, this book does not teach a beginner anything.I am taking it back."
4,Ravi in the Rain,"First off, this may have been recorded at Woodstock, but it is not rock, pop, folk or any other ""popular"" music. Also, because it was recorded at an overcrowded concert in the middle of a farm, during a rainstorm, the recording itself is not the best. That being said, this album contains some brilliant playing. Ravi is spectacular, Alla Rakha is unbelivable, especially on his solo, and the interplay between them at the climax of Raga Manj Khamaj is breathtaking.The three songs on the disc are not snippets, the shortest being over 8 minutes, and they require intent listening to appreciate, but it's worth it."
4,Not too bad,The book's not that bad. Its questions are similar to its examkracker lesson set. overall good practice for drilling yourself into remembering the material.
5,Miss Read is a cozy read!,"I love this series of Thrush Green, Fairacre and all the Miss Read books. They are sweet, funny and present great, quirky characters. Makes me want to live in a small village in England. Reading these just relaxes me... going to a simpler time when small pleasures and natural beauty made life grand."
5,My kids really like this toy.,"My two daughters aged 2 and 3 love to play with this pizza set. The velcro that holds the pizza together is really good, they can carry it around without the pan. I am glad I bought this for them."
5,Heather Simmons,This is a super cute set! Very realistic and great quality! I can't wait for my daughter to open it on Christmas!
5,Multilingual OCR that works!,"The FineReader OCR package performs as advertized. I required a package that worked with other alphabets and FineReader fit the bill. I was able to perform OCR on faint 9.5 point Czech typeface with no training -- and I got Czech spell checking to boot.The package is so simple that I failed to read the manual for the first week of use, then when I finally read it, discovered all kinds of OCR aids built into the package. The FineReader does everything I need and more. What's more, you can download a fully operational package and use it for two weeks to be sure it does what you want."
5,Footprints to Follow Proudly,"Rich, simple and startlingly clear & deep, the poetry of Ruth Bell Graham speaks a heart language that lends itself alike to silent contemplation or verbal reading.This is far more than an attractive coffee-table book. It is a treasure of rich verse, beautiful language, deep insight and breathtaking honesty.An ideal gift for yourself or that special someone, this is a book that will continue to give every time it is opened. It also poses the risk of making poetry lovers from those who think all poetry is stilted and obscure."
2,Heavy,This is a much better book than the Visual Quivk Pro book. At least you don't get the manual just reprinted...but with less detail.My problem with this book is that it's not for a beginner. Doesn't anyone do a book that's not for Oscar winners? I got FCP2 as a present and just want to edit my DV footage and add some titles and effects. Macworld has some neat ideas but theres just too much inbetween what I need.I guess I'll just start on the manual again... :O(
1,"Not for Guys, Tshirts will not fit on top rack = worthless","This may work for women who need to hand up shirts that are not very long, but for regular tshirts and dress shirts, forget about it. Just look at the image. The top rack becomes worthless as the height is too short so don't count on hanging jeans on the bottom and shirts on the top unless you're going to use this for toddlers."
5,Fantastic!,I love these double hangers. I have very small closets and every inch utilized counts. These doublers are being used in all of my closets now and really do allow you to double the space. If you don't want anything dragging on the floor I recommend setting them up to use one half for shorts and the other for longer items such as pants or shirts. You certainly won't be able to double your dress space but that is not really what these are intended for. Overall a great purchase and you certainly can't beat the pricing found on Amazon- I know I have tried!
4,Cheap solution for baby closet,"I'm setting up the nursery for our first baby and realized that I need more closet space. Viola! Solution found. This is exactly what I needed - it does the job, it was under $10, I didn't have to leave the house to search stores for it, and it came with free shipping. Bonus that I could ""assemble"" it myself, it's so simple. It's a great, simple solution for the purpose that I need it for.Addressing some other concerns from other reviews I read:1) Sharp edges. I wouldn't say any of the edges are sharp. Probably not pleasant to rub against, but nothing that is dangerous or would snag clothes or hurt someone. Sometimes it's possible to worry too much.2) Top rung not having enough room to hang clothes. For hanging baby shirts and baby outfits this is not an issue."
3,A collection of stories characteristic of southern lifestyle,"Although Ernest Gaines manipulates the subjects of his former novels into this novel, it accurately portrays a side of southern life which extends beyond the general theme of racism. In addition to depicting honorable morals, Gaines portrays the black race as a generally honorable people. Despite shortcomings and tribulation, the main characters of the novel produce an honorable aura about man and his accepted levels of change."
5,One of the best,I was going for a Ph.D. in philosophy and wanted to be a professor until I read this book. I dropped out of the graduate program and started to write fiction.This book of short fiction is dark and haunting. The first two stories are the best (A Long Day in November and The Sky is Gray). The stories are simple with a lot of social commentaries of rural Louisiana life. Both deal with black kids trying to make it in a white world.This is a fine collection of stories by a young writer crafting his voice. The writing is simple--one can see the influence of Hemingway--yet there are a lot of social commentaries and subtle psychological insights that Gaines would later hone to perfection. Buy this book. The first two stories are classics and should be read by all people.
2,stickers don't stick,"The images are great and the concept fun. My 4 yr old was quite excited. Unfortunately, not only do the stickers not re-stick, they often don't stay stuck the first time. Very frustrating. I spent a lot of time trying to stick them down really hard using my fingernails (had no glue available). My son eventually lost interest because it was just not user-friendly. Too bad. ""Storytime Stickers"" published by Sterling seems to make better ""reusable"" sticker books."
3,It's a sticker book,"I've said it before in other reviews of sticker books. If a 3 or 4 year old enjoys it, just pick a subject that interests them and I'm sure they will enjoy it. This had a lot of bare planetary landscapes and views of space. There was no story to follow."
4,Small entertainment,"This lava lamp works well for a while, but if you leave it on for a long time the wax just seems to glob in the middle and float there without flowing. If you shake it to get the wax to move, it breaks up into tiny bubbles and looks cloudy. My suggestion is to only leave it on for about two to three hours at most and then let it cool down before using it again."
4,Well made and good value,These are a great value. They have extra paper wrapped at the bottom so they don't leak. 200 count for that price is a good deal.
4,Very useful hook!,"I ordered 4 of these because they looked as though I could hang a variety of things: candles, lanterns, windchimes, mobiles, for example. I hung two candle lanterns so they'll be handy during our fairly frequent power outages. But I realized the two were not hanging identically! One was lower than the other. I replaced one with the same hook, the 3rd one, and now they hang fine. So I've assigned 4 stars because they may not be shaped exactly the same if you want to use them in pairs. But they are very sturdy. You should attach them with screws (not included) for best results."
2,In the Arena,"I began ""In the Arena"" with great hopes for a really outstanding book by this famous actor. However, I did not finish the book due to the fact I began to find it's contents BORING. I also got the impression that since Mr. Heston played Moses, he thinks he is ""holy."" However, his rough language turned me totally off & he is now wayyy down on my list. He is doing a good job with the NRA, granted, but personally, I do not hold him in high regard after reading his book. I also will not be interested in his 'goldie-oldie' movies anymore."
1,NC-2200W printer server,"After 4 hours of trying to get the unit to connect to my printer, I gave up. The instructions for setting up the server are sketchy, assuming I am a computer expert. I am returning the product."
2,He foresaw it wrong,I read this book some years ago . The analysis it gave of the impending death of the nation- state as central actor in political affairs has proven extremely premature.Brzezinski has a great knowledge of world affairs but somehow his perception is skewed. His writing style is also awkward and needlessly complicated.
4,useful material,needed this book for a course and it was useful- especially since it was a required book...and much cheaper than the University bookstore.
5,Great memories,"I used to watch this movie with my uncle and aunt when I was little.They're both gone and I've been looking for this movie for a while. I finally found and it brings back good memories. Everytime I watch this movie I think of both of them. I really enjoy this movie.Thanks,L.M."
5,Best spaghetti western ever made!,This is such a hilarious movie! It is like 40-50 years old and my teenage kids couldn't believe it whenthey saw it! It is their favorite movie!
5,Good Times,"If you're a fan of old movies, and like the romantic/comedy genre, then this is a movie for you. Fred MacMurry and Claudette Colbert are a perfect match for a newlywed couple. He home from the war and looking for a new business to make him successful and she dreaming of a white cape cod home complete with a picket fence.Little does she know that he's already cooked up a crazy scheme to get ahead, and it doesn't include living in the city and belonging to the best clubs.Also, if you're a fan of the Ma & Pa Kettle movies, this is the movie that not only establishes their characters, but gives them a strong second billing to the stars.All in all, this is a fun romp of a movie, and one that you'll find you want to watch more than once."
3,They are what they are...,"I got these chips and they are what they are. Just cheap poker chips. They work fine for what I use them for. However, as another reviewer noted the colors seem to be a bit dull compared to my older chips. Not a huge deal, but noticeable."
4,Good but dirty,"Good buy. Chips are wrapped in plastic, but for some reason the plastic wrap and chips at both ends of each set were dirty with a black smoke or a soft black dirt. I hope that black dirt is nothing dangerous; and if it is... too late! Make sure before opening each chip set, clean the plastic wrap and both end chips."
4,nice,"great set, and amazing for someone who gambles for fun like me, but mine came with some problems, like some screwed up chips and cheap separators"
5,Great set. Very pleased.,"After reading some of the reviews, I was not sure how great of a poker set I was actually getting. I bought it anyway because it seemed like such a great price, and I am extremely happy with what I got. I received the item in perfect condition and the chips are all in perfect shape. I have already gotten a lot of use out of this set. Many of my friends have also broken down and bought one as well because they loved mine so much. All in all, awesome product."
5,a great set,"I ordererd this poker set last year.It was great, chips and the case was all I expected.I had to order another set because my poker night grew.The seconed set was just as great as the first one. I wouldrecomend this set to anyone."
4,Poker Chips Review,"The first set that we received we sent back. The advertisement said that the chips came in a ""heavy duty"" aluminum box. We did not find this to be true. The hinges were not aligned well, the lid was flimsy, and the velvet inside was coming loose. I was immediately sent another set by your wonderful customer agents. When the UPS driver walked across the street holding the box in 2 fingers, I knew something was awry. It was empty! Again, I received a great response from your customer service representatives and was sent yet another box. This time the box contained a set of poker chips with a much more durable aluminum box. Thank you so very much."
2,The case was broken when I received it,The case was cracked when I received it and it was a gift for somebody. Other stuff is fine but was just not happy with the case
4,Great price and good quality,This is a seriously heavy duty set. Bought it for a company party and was pleasantly surprised. Best price I could find anywhere too!
2,missing chips,"We just got this item in the mail and are very disappointed. Its missing a whole row of chips, and one of the latches on the case is broken!"
4,Decent,"the contents in the case were as expected except for a missing dice.however, the case came with a slight dent at the back"
2,"Fine as a basic set, but don't buy if you're picky.","These poker chips are what they say they are: a set of poker chips in a case, with cards and hold 'em buttons. That is the best I can say about them. For me, that's enough, but there are some MAJOR quality control issues with this product. (As in, a complete lack of quality control...)Yes, the chips are poorly painted, with flaws all over, and bumps and scratches all over them. Yes, the inside of the case has ripped lining in a few places and a sticky hinge. Yes, the case is dented all over on the outside. Yes, the locks REALLY suck.But I knew all that when I bought this set. The other reviews will say the same. I still bought the set, knowing this, because for me, it doesn't matter, and it's way more fun to play with poker chips than it is to play with coins. For less than $30, what more can you ask? The chips still work as poker chips. Nuff said."
2,Decent Product,"The chips are not all that good. There are few which don't have smooth surfaces. They have some edges that you can see for products that are not very well finished.Also, the case was broken when it arrived. Most of the partitions had all come off. It might have been because of mishandling while shipping, bu the packaging was definitely not good either."
5,good chips,The chips are really cool. they are heavy and seem of the same quality as the higher end chips. I strongly recommend these.but do not buy this set for the case or the cards. the case is probably gonna have blemishes and the cards are really plasticy (i understand thats not a word but you get the picture).all in all the chips are what you're paying for and the case does an ok job holding them. its a good buy.
4,Keeps Food Pantry Honest,"We are a food pantry that services approximately 270 families with arouond 8000 pounds of food divided into boxes each week. Many of our clients are immobile and have others pick up their boxes for them. As with any give away someone (or someones) always try to get more than their fair share by getting an extra box. We tried various ways to transmit the information from the sign desk to those filling and delivering the boxes to the clients, but there was always some who found a way to get around this method until we started using the poker chips and specified the number of boxes by the color of chip. So far,at least to my knowledge, we have been able to keep all people honest from the standpoind of signing up for people on the list and getting the right number of boxes for those families. Everyone must now present a chip in order to get their boxes of food."
4,Lawnmower Man Series,"For the sci-fi group, these can be really interesting movies. Another takeoff on technology taking over the populace of the world. A computer enhanced individual getting a god complex and running amuck. I always liked the original and the sequel rounds the storyline out to mankind coming out on top. Worth a look-see."
3,Visually entertaining...,"This was a clever film with absolutely brilliant special F/X. Here we also see a pre-Bond Pierce Brosnan. I found it very slow in places and often confusing, but still good."
1,Not Worth It,"These movies can be had for 7 dollars a piece on amazon.com, and even cheaper elsewhere. definitely not with anywhere near 40 dollars for the set"
1,Lawnmower Man 0.5,"DO NOT buy this movie! If you were looking for the movie ""The Lawnmower Man"" this isn't it. This is Lawnmower Man 0.5 (something less than version 1.0). Unfortuanately, 1 star is as low as I could go.In this version, Dr. Angelo did not think of using Jobe because of his unfortunate accidental meeting with the violence crazed chimpanzee. The priest ws not so evil that he sold Jobe to Dr. Angelo for a donation to the church (and therefore deserve what he got). Jobe did not absorb hundreds of CDs learning the violent history of mankind and then decide that maybe he needed to protect mankind from itself. Dr. Angelo did not develop an extreme hatred for Jobe because he murdered Mrs. Angelo.Hey, all this stuff sounds like it would make a good plot to a movie or something."
1,"Good music, awful vocals","The music is fine. It's decent EBM/ dance industrial. Then the vocals kick in, and it's just embarassingly bad. If you only hear the first 30 seconds of each track, you might be seduced into buying this. But for me, the vocals really blow it on every track.These guy's considerable musical talents would be better utilized as backup to somebody that can actually sing."
4,Missing my Thrashers!,"The quality of the video is pretty decent; however, I'm having issues with the download and acquiring the license so that the file will play without the internet.I was in attendance for the only 2 playoff games that Thrashers had in Philips Arena. This video brings back some great memories and I'll always remember those games.Atlanta Spirit LLC and Gary Bettman suck ass!"
3,Okay Jogging Stroller,"The stroller is a good jogging stroller, however for the price there were a few things that I was not satisfied with. The seat does not have padding, and the adjustment to lay the seat back or forward is a pain in the butt. You have to tighten it or loosen it with straps that are similar to those on grocery carts. This is fine without the child in the seat, but with them in it is rather difficult (especially if they child is sleeping). Other then these two things I am satisfied when running with it. I just think for the price they could have made each of those a little better."
2,Wouldn't recommend it,"I got this stroller in late 2009 and I didn't know what I was looking for, so I thought lightweight would be best for a jogger stroller. However, who cares if it's lightweight because this stroller is hard to use. It is:-hard to fold down/close-very uncomfortable for baby (my son always cried sitting in it, finally I put a blanket down for him to sit on so he could bare it)-the cup holder is too small. This SUCKS for someone who wants to put a water bottle in it for jogging! Now I put the water bottle in the bottom basket, but I can't reach it when I'm jogging.-uncomfortable straps for child, that are also hard to use and adjust- no drink tray for babyI seriously recommend not buying this. It's even been discontinued on their website, along with all their strollers designed like this. They now design their strollers without all the things I just mentioned probably because nobody liked them."
3,Teen Titans in Comic form,"Teen Titans Go! is based on the animated series, Teen Titans (which is based on a series of DC comics from the 80's). The TV series is AMAZING, and is everything the typical kid's cartoon is not - it has depth that will capture any adult or older teen, complicated characters, and the delicate mix of drama, humor, and action. It will satisfy and hook almost anyone willing to watch it.The TTG! comics are entertaining for someone who is already a fan of Teen Titans, and many find them quite enjoyable, but I prefer the animated series by a longshot. DO NOT introduce yourself to Teen Titans through these comics, pick up the DVDs or watch it on TV."
2,Over rated!,"I do not understand the fuss about Thalia, I buy this CD thinking it would be grat but there are songs like ""El bombo de mi corazon"" that really sound childish; I really think this kind of songs are introduced to come out with a complete ""CD"" instead of releasing a single.Thalia is a beautiful face in a beautiful body but the content of the letter of the songs really is shallow and a product of publicity rather than a real artistic value!.Judge by yourself!"
4,great music and sound,"love the sound of sitar, beautiful and unique. The whole ""song"" is almost similar tune, but still beautiful."
3,Black Seed Oil,I just received this and bought it to help keep down my blood glucose. I cannot offer a complete review on this until I see if it will work for me.
4,shota's review,"I am a Japanese universuty student who watched the prison episode of ""30 Days"" in my English class. This episode shows,a normal Anerican man stay at prison for 30 days. His name is MOrgan Spurloct. The prisoners are not muders. Most of them are in prison is taking and selling drugs like cocain. Morgan stayed at two different building. he talked to many prisoners about their life and theirselves. I thought the show was realistic because one of the most prisoners was taking drug when he was a child. I would recommend this show because this show change my way. I thought we must not take drugs,again."
4,manami's Review,"I'm a Japanese university sutudent from Saitama.I watched the prison episode of ""30 days"" in English class.This episode shows Morgan,who is a normal American man, goes to prison for 30 days.The prison has two buildings-the east and west buildings.Morgan stays in both buildings.He meets and talk many prisoners.The prisoners are in prison for taking and selling drugs.I thought the show was good because morgan will be treated just like a normal prisoner.So,we can see a real life inside prison.I would recomend this show because we can know that drugs are so dangerous.If you use them once,you couldn't stop using them."
3,naoki's review,"My name is Naoki.I'm a Japanese and 19years old.I am a student of Asia university in Tokyo.In my English class,we watched this movie on Tuesday.The theme of this documentary is that Morgan Who is a normal American man goes to prison and lives there with prisoners for 30 days.heis treated just a normal prisoner.And he experienced many things.I think he is realy bravery!!His courage is a good exsample for us to follow(tm)"
3,Katsuya's review,My name is katsuya sato. I am Japanese student. I watched 30 days.This episode shows an American man spends in a NY's prison 30 days.He is treated as a real prisoner. The prison which he stays at doesn'thave homicides but criminals of drugs.This showed me what American prisoner are given more free time than Japanesn that. But the prisoners who were hold there almost looked likepretty thug. So If I stay there I will be scared all day.I would recommend this show because someone who saw this may think thathe that he doesn't want to be hold there. So he won't do stupid thingslike that.
3,Not what I was looking for,"These did not meet my expectations, the color was more of a brick red vice bright red, and I did not care for the texture of the handles. Also, the handles were not quite long enough. Returned this item."
3,Dissapointing sequel in a good series,"The third book in the Nina Reilly series was one I had high hopes for. The previous two novels featuring Nina were great court-room dramas with very well developed storylines/plots and characters.All this was missing in the third novel. The courtroom was entered only at a very late stage in the book and only for a brief period. The plot was quite flat and uninteresting and the development of the characters was not what we are used to from this writer team. Nina, Paul and Collier were still there old self ( in a way..) but the rest was not the sort of people I could feel any empathy with. I hope the next one will be better."
5,Wonderful product,"This closet doubler is an inexpensive way to hang your kids' clothes. I love this product, and so does my son."
1,Cheap and short,"This product did not work at all for me, it kept falling apart and is too short to work in my closet."
4,"Small, but excellent","This kit is pretty small. The spade is only about as big as my hand. The axe is also very roughly ground and won't chop anything. But, it fits neatly inside my back-pack and does the job (after grinding down the axe). I've actually grown to appreciate having the extra tools in a smaller kit. It is much more useful than my old combat shovel. It has definitely found a place in my camping gear."
2,Wicked small!,"When I say small, I mean like five inches long small. This is not a big shovel at all. Sure, its got the gadgets, but it ain't got the size."
3,Ok screen,"I got this screen, its OK. Have to return it as the screen developed some waviness on the sides. At one time the screen was stuck and will not roll down. Retuned it and got a wall mount permanant screen as I have plenty of space in my basement."
4,Added to my list!,"I read a lot of science fiction as you can see from my reviews over on Audible: everything from Niven to China Mieville to Abercrombie on the dark fantasy shelf, and some Scalzi thrown in for kicks and giggles. So, I was delighted to find a new voice that fits in there somewhere, near the crossroads of reality and epic adventure. Pendulum opens with a strong hook, but it was the heartfelt characters that kept me reading and how well the very different points of view blended into the narrative. Good read if you like sci-fi. Will add Richard Lynch to my list and I hope he's got more coming."
4,works for what I needed,"works well. Fit had to be adjusted, and used copius amounts of bathroom caulking to seal. Other than that the floor in the kids bathroom no longer resembles a swamp after their round of showers."
5,Takes a little work,It took a while to get it positioned but overall works great. No water on the floor. Fast shipping. Thanks.Recommend for mobile home tubs. You will save the flooring from rotting from being wet. A must have.
5,Stone Cold Surrender Review,Exceelent book! Another great piece by Brenda Jackson! As if she could write a bad book!
3,typical 50' sci-fi,"Typical 50's era sci-fi ""guttenburged"" straight from a out of copyright pump magazine from that period. Complete with blase story, uninspired characters and cliched ending. It has all makings of a Hollywood movie. Get the free kindle if you are a PKD or 50's pulp junkie, otherwise pass it by."
1,Total CRAP,"I already knew the basic salsa steps before purchasing this, and had hoped/thought this would be a great way to use those steps in a workout setting.WRONG! The instructor is boring, with no sense of rhythm. Neither he nor his partner can really move like good salsa dancers do. This guy is a complete hack, and his delivery is completely awkward. What's worse is that many of his steps are not even authentic salsa steps.While salsa dancing can provide a good workout, this is NOT the DVD that fits the bill.For those of you who want to learn salsa, DO NOT buy this DVD. Find someone who can truly dance salsa and learn from them!"
4,excellent,"Trees are best described as a slightly rockier Fairport Convention. If you know Fairport's Sandy Denny era music, you'll realize what a compliment this is to Trees.This band features a female singer with a bell-clear voice similar to Denny's' and the band behind her mines an organic, English folk aesthetic.But On The Shore features much stronger backbeats--there in none of Fairports jazz vibe-heavier guitar, and some keyboard work.Trees leaves nothing to be desired. - Absolutely solid overlooked progressive era music. Impressive. Get it!"
3,Excellent book,"Havent read the whole book yet, but I am already captivated by merely the introduction. I know this will be a good read, especially since a film documentary was based off this book. If you haven't seen the film documentary I highly suggest it."
4,Right on time,"My son needed this book for his community college class. Great savings and came 1 day before his second class.TeresaPhoenix, AZ"
5,the best book yet in the seires!!!,"I originaly came across Goose Girl and loved it so i decided to see if there was a sequel and there was, Enna Burning the book is about one Isi's best friends, Enna, and what happens after her mother dies and she has to deal with her brother. He some how gets the power of learning the language of the fire and suddenly dies in battle. Now Enna has the fire language and while spying gets kidnaped. Once she is back in the casle with Isi and Geric, Isi says that she must jorney to land of the fire speakers and learn how to control her fire. So Enna and Isi go not telling Geric that they will be gone over 3 weeks. In the end Enna learns how to control her fire and also that Isi is expecting. So they must jorney back to the casle before the baby arives (Geric doesn't know that Isi is pregnant) the story ends with Isi and Geric's baby being born."
5,I LOVE this book!!!,"i love all the books by Shannon Hale, have read this book over and over, and bought it. LOVE this book!!! Defiantly worth your while!!"
5,need to make one master set,"gasket set is fine, just is a bummer that you have to buy mulitple sets for different gaskets and then also have doubles of one gasket."
2,Dissapointed,Wouldn't play in my cd player. Cheaply made with little detail in the cover art. I guess I am used to the old days when they gave details on the artists and band members. What's with it being labeled as an IMPORT? I guess nothing is American made anymore :-(
2,Great while it lasts,"I purchased these batteries for a flaslight that consumes a terrible amount of energy (but the upside is it throws out a huge amount of light). The batteries worked well for a short time, but they didn't last, especially for the money paid. Duracell is much better (but more expensive) in that they last much longer."
3,Not the best value,If you absolutely only need two and you won't be using them much then these might be OK. I tried them in my duty light and they only lasted a few months. I suggest that for a much better value you consider10 pcs Energizer Lithium CR123A 3V Photo Lithium Batteries. They are much less expensive per battery and will probably last longer (I'm still on my first pair).
1,Batteries ultralast,"The batteries that i bought, one was in good condition and the other didnt work. I dont recomended this product."
1,Find a different brand,"OK, this is about the worst battery I ever used. I bought a couple of dozen from a reputable supplier with a 10 year shelf life. By the end of the first year whatever was unused had little battery life. Stick to Panasonic or Duracell."
5,Should be required reading for ALL Americans!,This book was a huge eye opener for me. A lot of material is given in the back of the book to verify what you are reading....you even get websites to view.Why isn't the truth about our American history being taught? I didn't like the answers I was coming up with.I warn readers....you will be angry that you have not been taught the truth about our American history.
2,Disappointed,"Do not be fooled by the description of this book. It is very much a book only about African American history. If you were looking for something more middle of the road that shows the flaws that our kids learn in history class these days, this book is not for you. It doesn't exactly ""set the record straight"". It merely amplifies what we are forced to hear about everyday. Overall a disappointing read for me."
5,This book should be taught in every school in America,This book opened my eyes about all the lies and whitewashing that was done to me in public school. So much valuable history hidden from us. How sad not to tell the truth about the part that Black Americans played in building this country.
2,"Good history, but far too partisan.","The historical context is very interesting, and certainly filled with facts that I was previously unaware of (and glad I am now aware of). However, the book becomes cumbersome to read because it quickly turns from what should be about black history into a ""democrats are racist, republicans are not"" essay. There are far too many jabs at democrats to give this anything close to an objective feel and almost makes me think the title should be ""Democrats hate black people"".It's a good book for showing some American black history, but feels too partisan to make it as enjoyable a read as it should be. There are likely much better options for a quick black history lesson from the Revolutionary War through the 1960s (though I don't know of any, so if you do feel free to let me know)."
1,Dumb and Dumber,Would you buy a book that makes fun of mentally challenged people? I doubt that this old author (who is trying to pass herself off as young) would appreciate a book that insults older readers. So why is she insulting any female who doesn't understand the complexities of the financial world? It's NOT fun. It's NOT funny! Check out Jane Bryant Quinn's or Andrew Tobias's books instead.
1,Girls Just Must Be DUMB,The author clearly thinks we're dumb. Why else would she talk down to us like this? I need basic money advice but this book is too condascending and the advice is so watered down that it doesn't give enough information so that I can make the right financial decisions for my individual circumstances. My college roommates agree!
2,"Very easy setup, and very easy to disrupt","I bought this to replace the wireless network to a basement office; the wireless had been OK but I'd lose connectivity whenever the cordless phone rang. For me, powerline ethernet turned out to be worse. The throughput was better but various things in my house (washer/dryer, furnace, vacuum) would cause enough interference to kill the signal (not always, but enough to be annoying). It would also sometimes seem to go out briefly for no apparent reason. I gave up and finally ran cat5 cable through the walls and returned this."
1,a complete waste of money,this product is a complete piece of junk. the connection is intermittant and the speed is slow like snail. stay away from it.
2,Slower than wireless,"Easy to install, but slower than wireless which defeats the whole purpose of purchasing this unit."
2,Not what I was hoping for.,"I wanted to connect my Garage/office broadband internet to my wife's computer which was in the house, less than 100' away. The connection was slower than dial-up. I gave it to my brother to use with a LAN printer and it worked, but it is a printer not internet web pages or downloads."
1,Does not hold up.,"Worked well then failed after a couple months. You are better off biting the bullet and paying an electrician to pull you a new line. This is a temp solution, an expensive temp solution."
5,Rammstein's third studio album rocks hard,"This album is considered by most fans to be their best album so far, and no wonder. It has many great tracks and will make you bang your head, but in the end, you always want more. That's why Rammstein sticks to 11 tracks. All in all, it's a good thing they didn't include any more tracks, it would have changed the flow of the album."
4,A new kind of Rammstein,"Rammstein's latest album Mutter comes as a fresh breath of air in the current rock scene. After seeing so many new rap-rock bands, Rammstein's new album is a mix of techno, metal, orchestra, and pop. Songs such as ""Mein Herz Brennt"" come with a full orchestral background. Other songs such as ""Nebel"" are slower and not as heavy but still pack a punch. Mutter also is packed with electrically enhanced guitar and industrial riffs. The enigmatic sextet's last album Sehnsucht went Gold in the US and this album looks to be even better. Mutter has a wider appeal, not seen as just death metal. Previous songs as ""Du Hast"" were seen as evil or dark, the new album, although still in German, has more of an inspiring or uplifting feel. Many just see this as a German Ministry, they are vastly different. Rammstein may not be breaking down any barriers; but you'll want to check this out."
2,Disappointment,"I didn't like this one at all. Yes there are a few good songs but most of them I didn't like and compared to their previous albums (which I thought were great) doesn't stand up. Songs are built poorly, and the sound in the old ones was much better"
1,SUCKS,"IT SUCKS. People get so fascinated by the smallest S***. They think it sounds fascinating because of the german language and how the guy sounds, ok then lets break it down. This singer couldn't hit a high note if his life depended on it and he is not singing he is just talking, wow what talent, then guitar player has no idea of melodic and/or musical theory thus making everything that is guitar sound so dull and boring, that is also why half of the bands today that claim to be hard rock or metal suck. And the rest of the band speaks for themselfs. Unlike everyone else i don't hear soemthing like a german voice in mainstream wanna be metal and think wow thats awesome sounding, instead i break all the musicians up and judge them on talent like it should be and you guys should try it sometime."
5,Nice...Really nice,"Wow, ok, those who tell you this cd sucks are on crack. Obviously they do not know what they are talking about, this cd is one of the best I have ever heard. While a few of the songs are kinda boring, thats just 2 of the 11 songs. A beautiful cd with both hard, heavy industrial riffs, and a melodic tune which just makes the music twice as good as it already is. The cd has a wide variety of styles ranging from industrial, to a hard type of punk, to even some metal with orchestral arrangements. I havent left home without it, and im listening to it now. I cant wait to see their live show"
5,"Rammstein's ""Mutter"" is the best!!!!","This is to me the best Rammstein album I ever heard. I got Sehnsucht and Herzeleid but they don't compare to Mutter. I mean a Symphony with Rammstein on some of the songs, that's just great and it sounds good. So it's worth buying."
4,Entertaining to Read,"I liked this selection because it is fairly well written. It is the original story of Escaflowne before the anime ever came out, so the story is a little different. This disappointed me for a little bit, but I did decide that since it was the first sign of escaflowne to ever be released in Japan, I decided to except it. It is better to read if you don't even think about how different it is from the show."
3,Middling,"While I always enjoy a Spider Man tale, this one was a bit shallow in places. I also get weary of the characters explaining everything that happens of their motives for everything they do. Who talks like that? I do like the classic comic art and the character of the Wraith certainly has some potential."
4,Dramatic Historical Novel,"This novel of the First World War is both epic and masterful. It is the story of an ordinary Russian soldier who escapes from prison camp and decides to walk home to his family. In the process of returning he assumes the identity of a dead soldier, but then his real adventures begin."
5,Super Hot and Sexy - Howard knows how to heat you up,I Love the heroine and loved Gray's character just as much.Linda Howards books are so darn good. She's one of a short list of authors that I can't get enough of.
2,Not Linda's best,"First chapter was excellent and I was thinking I'd found another LH great. This book could have been half the length. Dragged redundantly through the characters same thought processes until I could have recited them in my sleep, I have not seen a story where the characters mused over their problems so often. Though the characters were strong, they were brought together by one element - sex, which really doesn't hold a story together as well as deep abiding love, earned by overcoming adversity. Too bad really, because it could have been so much more."
5,You won't be disappointed,"In this book you get a heart warming story with some , tears and laughter. HOWARD DELIVERS IT ALL"
4,Wonderful...,"I think this book was wonderful. It's almost as good as Kill and Tell which is my favourite romance novel. There are some things in this book that I do not like. The first time I read it I would have given it five stars. But now, I can't really put my finger on it but I don't like it as much as before. Maybe because the element of surprise is taken away. Or maybe it is because of Gray's sister. I really don't like her at all. She isn't very normal. I get mad because she doesn't speak up until in the end of the book. Otherwise, I just love it. Faith and Gray are just perfect for eachother and LH describes it very well."
3,"Not her greatest love story, but...","Setting: Modern TimesWhat I disliked about the book was the fact that Gray treated Faith like dirt when she was just a child. She had a poor childhood, but she loved Gray at a far distant. When she was a child, she witnessed Gray having sex with a woman who was engaged to be married to another man. After Gray hooks up with Faith, the story moved on smoothly and I love how Gray is with Faith. This is still worth to read cause I love Linda Howard's alpha male characters in her booksThis book is a ""MUST have"" to add to your romance book collection."
3,depends on your point of view,"If you are looking for a book with great sex scenes, then this would be a great book for you. However, the main character Gray is very unlikeable, so unless your willing to handle his character, you might want to bypass this book. Also, Gray's change of character is unbelievable- he only changed because he was sexually attracted to faith!!"
5,whew...mercy!,"The story of Faith and Gray is refreshingly believable and easy to get caught up in. Faith is smart and beautiful, while Gray is sexy and commanding. Their attraction is heart-stopping and their encounters are heart-pounding. I agree with others that the porch scene will leave you breathless, while the public bathroom scene will leave you dying for a meeting with Gray! WHAT A MAN! Gray's explanation also let me know why my husband doesn't say much while we're... This is my first read of Ms. Howard's and it will definitely not be my last."
5,it's like magic,when i heard every song in this album ... wo....ow it makes me wanna dance like a crazy. The music hipnotizing everyone who hears it. It make my feet don't wanna stop. My heart sing with the song. And my soul flow with the music.
2,Disappointment,"Since this author uses film and not digital, some of the info is irrelevant to most photographers today. Also, he uses polarizing and warming filters on almost every shot, which I feel makes for stange and unpleasant look. However, the tips about camera angle and time of day may be good (I will try them out when I get there)."
3,Use with caution,"Author provides some good information about locations, access, and such, but the photographic advice is to be taken with some caution. Since he uses high-saturation film, enhancing filter plus a polarizing filter at its maximum effect for nearly every shot, everything looks muddy and oversaturated, with no true whites evident even in the winter shots. Show me the crisp colors which your eyes can see when in these locations!"
4,"Ed McBain's ""King's Ransom""",I enjoyed reading the book on my Kindle. I always enjoy his mysteries. The characters are well developed and I feel I know each of them personally. It is fun to read the interactions between them and their personality quirks. I recommend this book.
5,A superb companion for teachers,"Beginning to experienced teachers will glean ideas of ways to set up and/or improve their classroom environment by reading Louanne Johnson's book. An experienced teacher herself, Johnson also has a psychology background and uses it to explain what works with students. She is positively oriented and covers everything from preparing yourself as a teacher to physical logistics, discipline, motivation, working with parents, time and energy savers, etc. I've taught elementary to university students over the years and am implementing some of her suggestions as school starts out this year. I'm so glad I found this book."
1,Very Unhappy,"I heard so much about ""Rowenta"" I was real excited about getting the iron...I got it...it didn't work....end of story. Had to get a refund...took a little time but it did come through. I will never purchase on line again....at least I don't think I will. The deal might sound good...but if in the end you get screwed because of a non functioning product....what good is the deal.I tried to enter a ""0"" in my rating of this item but it wouldn't allow me to do so."
1,Scent doesn't last....,This is the first time I ordered perfume from amazon but didn't have a good experience. I love the scent of bvlgari omnia but I'm pretty sure this is not the original one. I sprayed so much but the scent still doesn't last. This has more of an alcohol and a drop of perfume. I'm not sure if I can still return it though... I don't hae the box anymore :(
4,Works flawlessly.,"This product works as advertised. I installed it in a stock '72 c-10 with a 350 engine. It runs smoother than ever and smoothe through the RPM range. No sputter like it had with points. One drawback is that the instructions make it sound like installation is a 10 minute job. Realistically, you should probably plan on a good hour to remove the distributor from the engine, do the conversion, and reinstall and time the ignition. If you plan on doing a coil too and want to run a 12V lead to the coil you'll have additional time to think of also. To do conversion and coil with 12V lead took me 2 hours before the test drive."
2,"Amazing Movie, Lousy DVD","This is the second of John Dahl's original Noir Trilogy, and it's a fantastic little film. But the DVD release is flat-out terrible! The film was shot and released in a widescreen format (1.85 specifically) but the DVD release - for the US market - is 1.33 pan n' scan. Particularly annoying, as the international release is apparently in 1.85. The DVD also has no extras of any kind - it barely even has a menu! No commentary track, no choices of audio format, no subtitles in any language, not even so much as a theatrical trailer. As much fun as this movie is - and it's a lot of fun - the disc almost isn't worth the bother, because it's impossible to watch it and not be constantly reminded of what a poor job Artisan's done in presenting it. I shudder to think how bad the DVD for Kill Me Again is going to be (it hasn't arrived yet) if it's been done by the same people, with the same lack of care."
3,"5 star movie, 1 star DVD","Great movie, I just can't believe they released this in full screen (1.33:1). Boo Hiss Artisan. Also, no extras.Don't you love it when they list SCENE INDEX andINTERACTIVE MENUS as ""Special Features"". Geesh.Say NO to pan and scan."
2,Poor man's BODY HEAT,"Despite a high-powered performance by lead actress Linda Fiorentino, THE LAST SEDUCTION was hardly the BODY HEAT of the 1990s.THE LAST SEDUCTION depends too much on Fiorentino taking advantage of others' stupidity. If only it were as easy in real life! One example of this bad writing, for those who have seen it, is the scene where she asks a black man about a certain racial stereotype.Good films hinge on out-smarting people. Not-so-good ones need people to be stupid. THE LAST SEDUCTION might be worth seeing on cable TV; it was made for cable, and that is where it belongs. Save your rental/purchase money for better works."
5,a stone cold classik in my book! moon & enwhistle are sorely missed!,"I used to have the original vinyl. Bought it when i was like 12 at Sears in the record department (remember the record department? upstairs at the Westland Mall location?? Bought Live @Leeds & Who Are You? fast forward to about ten years ago. I finally got around to re-buying Live@Leeds on cd. I am happy with the bonus tracks on here: Heaven and Hell, Tattoo, and Fortune Teller-The strongest 'bonus' track is Enwhistle's Heaven & Hell. My faves on the original album is the smokin take on Eddie Cochran's Summertime Blues as well as a smoldering take on Johnny Kidd & The Pirates' Shakin All Over. Great versions of Magic Bus, Substitute, SeeMe Feel Me, and My Generation. Too bad Keith Moon and John Enwhistle have checked into their respective suites in RocknRoll Heaven. It must've been RnR Heaven to have been in attendance at this gig! At least we have this killer disc as a memento of good times past & gone."
1,awful,"Really horrible sound quality, and the band must have been totally wasted...Apparently with so many for sale , others thought the same."
3,Original greatness diminished by inclusiveness,"Not many people will stumble upon this review of a recording that is the embodiment of power trio rock. To have done so will probably imply a deep familiarity with THE WHO and the exalted place the original album has in the pantheon of live rock & roll recordings.For the sake of this review, lets's use the original as a basis of comparison. For the sake of brevity, let me remark that you'll be asthetically better off finding the album in a used record shop than buying this reissue that obliterates the rhythm, structure and visceral power of the original mix. Sorry, but this splice job totally ruins the Magic Bus denouement which made the original edit a masterpiece. In this case, more is less."
5,Brilliant Performance + Fantastic Sound = Great CD !!!!,"Finally MCA has decided to release the entire Who concert recorded live at Leeds university in 1970. And now that i can hear it, i really wonder why it take so long to put out this brilliant performance available in it's entirely.Here you have a chance to hear vintage Who music: raw, loud, in your face rock 'n roll. Entwistle playing remarkable bass lines, like a second lead guitar really (he was named by guitar magazine the best bass player of the century). Moon attacking the drums like nobody else (well...maybe John Bonham). Daltrey singing powerful lines with his howling voice...well, and finally there's Pete Townshend, the brain of The Who, power chording al the songs in a great display of rock guitar playing.You won't be dissapointed by purchasing this double CD, it0s simply amazing!!!!"
1,"I love it, I love it NOT","This movie was terrible!! My roomate and I rented it because we enjoyed the quirkiness of Amelie and of course we loved the actress, but this movie was awful! To be completely honest, I am only going to recommend this movie to people who I do not like. It was a waste of my time, although I am glad I went ahead and watched it so that I can warn anyone else from ever renting it or buying it. He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not was a psychotic movie with a crazy plot and you shouldn't see it unless you want to torture yourself for over 1 1/2 hours! Although...If you want to have a movie to really laugh your ass off at...this is probably the one."
5,Provides an Excellent Point of Reference,"If you are curious what it takes to be great, this is a wonderful road map. This is a must have (Volume 1 & 2) In it, they describe one hundred biographies of the most influential personalities of world history, including philosophers, explorers, inventors, scientists, writers, artists, composers, religious, political and military leaders.The final summary is that all 100 individuals presented in this series possessed the following 10 characteristics:FocusPreparednessConvictionPerseveranceCreativityCuriosityResilienceRisk TakingIndependenceand a sense of higher purposeRating: Strong Buy (Despite the fact that it can only be purchased on tape)"
2,I kept reading just to find out why anyone would stand for Joe's guff...,"It's true. Halfway through the book I exclaimed to my husband - ""This guy is such a jerk!"" Who would put up with him for so long? I just finished the book to see if they mobbed him or what.It's OK for scifi, I'm not that discriminating. But I don't understand Maclaughlin's insistence in using such a jerk as the main character. No, I do understand why he does it. I mean, Joe *has* to be that much of a heel to get done what he gets done. But my big question is, Is it believable? I don't think so. (We're talking about the character, not the science behind the story.)So, Dean, what were you thinking? And did Joe resemble anyone you know?"
3,Michael Douglas had better roles&#65533;,"This is the common type of Michael Douglas type of movies with one exception, he rarely plays the role of a victim! Of course the movie is intriguing, you can see for the first time Demi Moore acts as a smooth criminal! But for those who enjoy reading books, I advise them to read the book instead of watching it! Here is why:1. The suspense in this movie is not as powerful as it should be. Usually Michael's movies are more powerful, violent and compelling. But the book creates all the dimensions you need to live the thrill and suspense of the story.2. In the movie, Michael never losses his temper! Come on his reputation, career, money and family are all in jeopardy but he manages not to lose his temper!!! Normally he should lose his mind!Other than that, the movie is brilliant and is still worth seeing! Both actors did a great job but maybe the screen writer or the director is to blame for the weak points!"
5,Still up to date!,"Disclosure is a suspenseful corporate intrigue drama, showing what goes on behind close doors in many places. It has an appealing interface to the audience by showing how products can be made flawed by careless manufacturing, but more importantly that one aspect of sex entanglements between partners is associated with power, in this case, of an alpha-woman over an unprepared man, so to speak.The Blu-Ray edition is simple, yet very well transferred, image and sound altogether."
1,"I bought it to use in a flashlight... came with a sticker ""not for use in flashlights""",bought these to use in my BRINKMANN maxfire lx (820-1025-0) flashlight. the details and images of this product do not mention that it is not for use in flashlights.why can't this battery be used in flashlights?if it can't why wasn't this detailed in the product description or picture?
5,Kaki's best,"I'm really surprised that this only has 4 stars. I think this is by far the best album Kaki has done. I find it to be way better than her latest ""dreaming of revenge"". There's just a real feeling on this album, it's brilliant from start to finish. Jessica is a fantastic track, as well as the opener, yellowcake. The whole record flows as a coherent piece. Timeless."
3,must read on mysticism,"A very remarkable piece of mysticism literature emerging from a time long before the classics of Carmelite Spirituality. It's an interesting work for those interested in via negativa. Thorough and engaging, allowing one to focus solely on what really matters in the Spiritual Life. Definitely not for the faint of heart."
2,Van Gogh Drawings,Drawings in this set were not very good quality. But they are interesting (and reasonable) if you are not familiar with them.[[ASIN:0486254852 Van Gogh Drawings: 44 Plates (Dover Art Library)
1,A Major Disappointment,"This book was disappointing. I didn't even finish it because it was so boring. Lynn Kurland's other books were very good, but this one ranked very low on my list of good books. The characters seemed implausable and did not fit the usual characteristics. And it was a bit unbelievable that the hero of the book was 30 something and had never kissed a woman.I would not recommend this book. It's a waste of time and money. Definately not worth reading."
5,Lynn Kurland is exceptional,"I agree with all of the 5 star reviews. Even though it is a ""closed door"" type of romance, you feel all the love and pain of the characters. It is a wonderful book that you just can't put down."
4,Dance through Time,"Wonderfully light hearted ""get away from it all"" book. It made for a terrific afternoon's escape from reality."
5,Absolutely delightful and one to reread frequently!,"This is one story which I thoroughly enjoyed. Ms. Kurland draws full, rich characters for both the hero (Jamie) and heroine (Beth). Elizabeth on her own is a little bland, but once she meets her Jamie, then magic occurs! With humor infused throughout the story, I have frequently been seen to either be laughing or grinning during my commute while reading! Even the secondary characters are all well-drawn, and the reader can often affectionately look at them to see their latest antics."
3,Only for the photos,"It's worth ony for the photos, which are great. The text is brief and adds almost nothing."
1,A Severe Waste of Time,"The only good news here is that this is a very slim volume, so it won't waste that much of your time."
4,On ambivalence,"Chapter 7, The Ambivalent Man, is worth the price of the book. I meet a guy who was charming, handsome, deep, interesting, and and deeply ambivalent. He positively radiated ambivalence. I never knew what I was doin wrong. I blamed myself for his confusing behavior. Ms. Findling explains the immature behavior behind such actions. She made me realize that sum total of what I did wrong was beat on myself for his actions. She also explained the range of emotions one will feel when breaking away from such a relationship, including lingering love and feelings of warmth, that it is OK to feel these but not to express them.Hats off! By the way, I am gay, and this book was quite applicable for gay men."
5,Awesome!,"I have had this book for almost 10 years and it has helped me, more times than one, in letting go of relationships that didn't work for me. Now, you have to be willing to do what it says!! I have suggested, and purchased it, for friends having trouble letting go as well. I highly recommend this book!"
1,Don't Call That Man,"I received the WRONG book, with no invoice ---- not very professinal!!! I don't believe the deserve any stars -- how about a minus."
5,A mans view,"Great book with a lot of good advice for Men also..... Yes, men have broken hearts and the section about ""Ambivalent people"" really made the book worth the read."
5,Gene,"As Good as It Gets simply is as good as it gets with Gene, this is a CD where you don't have to worry about only enjoying a couple songs, once in your CD player each song compliments the next. I suggest listening while have some alcohol on hand, great sounds to drink to."
5,An Overlooked Gem,"Peter Fonda hit a homerun with this film. It represents one of the best efforts in producing a gritty and visually beautiful western. This is one of my favorite westerns and epitomizes the late 60's early 70's earthy, grimy, style of the genre."
1,Poor Video,"This is a great film, it has been one of my favorites for years.The photography is wonderful, and the sound track is great.Unfortunately, the copy that was ...of such poor quality, that it was unwatchable."
5,I love this stuff!,"This stuff is great! It makes me feel and look awake and refreshed, and it's not too heavy. I will definitely keep using this."
2,"good hat, but....","Everything was ok except the measurement. Way too big for my head, definitely not a 7 1/4 like I ordered."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,Bought this for my 3 year old. Probably would have been a good toy but the car that comes with the set could barely make the turns and had to be frequently encouraged to continue on its way. After about an hour it conked out completely. You could hear the engine running but no wheel movement. Even with this my daughter tried to continue playing with the set by pushing the car along the track but got frustrated because the track would keep coming apart. We finally tossed the whole thing in the garbage with the promise to buy something better.
2,Not so great.,It's a clever idea but it doesn't work as well as your standard lint rollers. It's sticky but not as sticky as the tape-on-a-handle types. Also you only get a few swipes before its full & then you have to go wash it off & dry it before you can use it again. Regular lint rollers are pretty cheap and work much better than these things.
4,Very nice!,"This works nice on clothes. However, you do have to wash them too often before continuing to use it on the same shirt, etc. Even when you wash it, you can't use it until you let it dry, which takes a long time. I wash it before I go to bed, and leave it in a strainer until morning. Then in the morning, I'll put it together, use it on my outermost garments and put it away. The travel one is crap, I don't use it. This is nice if you can't continue to purchase the paper ones all of the time. If you can, buy the paper ones. Although, the pieces and handles are durable and it won't snap or break, like others and others with springs. 7.5/10"
3,not detailed enough,"This book is good if you already know how to write magazine articles. It gives a lot of information on the business side and getting them published. The actual writing section is not detailed enough, though and gives generic advice, such as to review it the next day with a fresh set of eyes."
4,Life on the Pharm...,"The Phunny Pharm provides an alternative to the rote pharmacologic memorization that medical students face. By introducing you to a world where penicillins are in a baseball game, and cardiac phys is a train ride, you have a ""story"" to help keep the hundreds of drugs straight in your mind. Some of the tales require a real stretch of the imagination, perhaps more than it's worth. Overall, several of my classmates found it worthwhile, especially for the antibiotics. Some of the bizarre little stories are just weird enough to remember in the 4th hour of your pharm final..."
2,Really Eats Batteries,"I travel quite frequently, and wanted a travel makeup mirror comparable to the one I have at home. The magnification of this one is good; and, unlike other reviewers, I haven't had trouble with the upper, 1X mirror staying on. The light works great if the batteries are brand new - however, that level of brightness lasts maybe two mornings. I am very careful to shut the mirror off when not in use; yet, I cannot get top quality batteries to light the thing for more than one business trip before I find myself gravitating toward a light in my room to actually see. It does have a port for an adapter. But, first, it doesn't come with an adapter; plus, I'm already packing charging cords for my phone and computer...it would just be one more thing to forget. Oh, and if I extend the neck, it tends to slide right back down. Apparently, it's a little too heavy for the design."
2,"My wife loves this mirror, BUT","I purchased this for my wife a few years ago. It lasted about 1 year before the glass fell out and broke. It still had the 10X mirror so she used it for another year or so until it died.So, I searched for a replacement, but this model won again, and I purchased another. It died after just a few weeks. I replaced it again, and that one died after a few months of use (after the warranty expired).I wish they would fix their quality control issues. I am willing to pay more for something that works for longer than the warranty period. A great idea poorly executed.Let me know if/when you get the quality up to a reasonable standard."
2,"Thought this was the best choice, but I was wrong","I read all the customer reviews for ""lighted mirrors"" on Amazon, and this one was given 5 stars by 2 people - so I bought it. The mirror's 8x magnification is really great - you'll see everything up close and in detail that other mirrors won't show you. The lighting is bright and pleasing. However, the quality of adjusting the height is pretty lame. It slides up and down easily even when it's tightened to full capacity. Also, the clock/alarm in mine is messed up. The alarm goes off even at the slightest touch of the mirror, and the buttons are very stiff and it's impossible to program the day or the time (and yes the alarm is still going off all the while). I don't want to buy another cell battery to see if that is what the problem is. I've spent several hours already trying to make it work. I am sending it back for a refund."
2,Only one mirror is lighted,"I received the Zadro mirror about a week ago. While I liked the quality of the light, I was disappointed in several ways. First, the height only adjusts a little bit--maybe 2-3."" So even the top mirror wasn't really high enough for me to use it easily for makeup application. Second, the hinged style of the mirror was annoying, because it wouldn't really stay in place. Third, only the bottom of the two mirrors (the magnified one) was lit. The top one wasn't lit at all, and that was the one I really wanted to use. Overall, I was very disappointed. I am returning the item today."
3,Zadro Lighted Makeup Mirror,Had this same style miorror for several years without any problems. First recent order can in and mirror wouldn' open correctly to make it useable. The replacement order came in and the top mirror has fallen out twice now; thankfully I was there and caught it before it broke to pieces. Apparently the quality of the products being made now just don't compare to my older version.
5,Under Armour is an understatement!,"What can I say except EXTRAordinary! The feel is exceptional. The performance is unreal. I can't believe they make clothing that feels so unbelievably silky smooth, yet performs like steel. If you haven't tried it, don't wait any longer. If you're an athlete like me, you don't know what you're missing. Absolutely incredible!!!"
4,Most Under Rated,"This like The Eye is the most under rated Diamond albumm by fans and critics alike. The main problem was that they became predictable. Overall, though, probably the heaviest album Diamond has made before or since. Key tracks are: Loa House, Voodoo and One Down Two to Go."
4,THE KING LIVES!!!!!,"No not that King!One of the true pioneers in shock n' roll,King Diamond lives with this kick-ass release.This is vintage King right here as he has inspired numerous death & black metal bands with his incredible falsetto voice and dark,maccabre stage shows.As far as i'm concerned,the King is one of the hardest working performers in the wonderful world of metal.The King really gets creative on this one and always has a story to tell that is never boring to a true fan.I saw him twice last year on the Voodoo tour and that's when I became hooked for good.If King Diamond/Mercyful Fate come around your way,check them out.You won't be sorry if you're a fan of theatrical-style metal like I am.Andy LaRocque is also one of the most underrated guitarists out there on the metal scene today and doesn't get the credit that he truly deserves as a talented musician and performer.Mark my words,you'll be hooked on this one from beginning to end!!!!"
5,pro bath spa,"awesome product ! well built very easy to use i would recomend for anyone with hand wrist and joint problems,the scented and warm wax makes you feel so good it leaves your hands very soft and moisterized"
5,excellent quality,"I use this hand bath at least once a day for an arthritic wrist; dip it five times, quickly wrap it in a produce bag and stick my hand into an oven mitt for about ten minutes. Then peel the wax back into the bath. It is incredibly helpful. I leave it heating 24/7 unless we are gone for a few days. If you have painful joints or arthritis, this is worth every single penny. You will feel relief every day."
1,Only worked once and has a short return period!,"I used the unit once. It did not work the second time, but I could not return it because it was past 30 days."
1,A biographer AND a school bus safety expert!,"Soon after the publication of this bio, it was reported that author Rick Davis also held a post in the Office of Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White as a school bus safety teacher at a salary of $72,565 per annum. The article in the Times of Ottawa (Illinois) also noted that "". . Davis freely admits he avoided some subjects that are touchy to White"" possibly the Secretary of State's two divorces and that the bio ""only briefly quotes one of White's two daughters.""The full review, entitled ""New biography outlines life of White,"" by Scott Reeder is on the MyWebTimes.com and was posted on line March 30,2006."
1,Don't be fooled by these reviews,"If you look at ""see my other reviews"" posted by the 5-Star people, you'll notice that 13 of the 15 only posted this one glowing review--seven years ago, when the book first came out.Fake, fake, fake!"
5,Search no further- This is IT!!,"This book is the BEST! This is NOT a ""diet"" book ,but a lifestyle book. With Robert & Krista's mindful approach to weight loss & healthy living, you will learn how to evolve in to a healthier, happier you, as they have taught me. They teach you in straight-to-the-point manner, all about nutrition, exercise, and mentally taking control of your life. I love how they are positive and supportive, and teach us to have the same mindset about ourselves & our decisions. Their approach doesn't involve strict food guidelines, nor does it promote pre-packaged meals, or any other diet fads. It is simply a COMPLETE way of releasing fat, and keeping it off, as I've successfully done. This is such a powerful, mind-altering way of looking at weight-loss & lifestyle choices, and has truly changed my life, as I'm sure it will yours. Search NO further for weight loss or nutritional answers, they are ALL HERE."
5,An Amazing Sound From an Amazing Band,"I thought the Beseech album ""From A Bleeding Heart..."" was simply one of the best gothic CDs I have ever heard. Beseech radiates with a unique and non-typical sound that encompasses nearly every human emotion possible. I am extremely enthusiastic about any future releases from the band."
2,Not What I Expected,I bought this book because I was under the impression that Ms. Langemeier would work with ordinary people like myself - and change their lives. She took subjects that already had a base - 401ks and properties and showed them how to use them to build wealth. I have none of these and was disappointed that there was no spring board for me to use.
5,Tips on acquiring wealth and the knowledge to build it,"Loral Langmeier is a financial strategist and coach who herself is a team-made multi-millionaire who has reached thousands yearly with her tips: her The Millionaire Maker: Act, Think And Make Money The Way The Wealthy Do provides tips on acquiring wealth and the knowledge to build it, providing the same financial insights and savvy millionaires have used to achieve success. Chapters discuss financial control, debt management and manipulation, forecasting, setting up business entities and more as they survey the road to independence and financial wealth."
4,Millionaire Maker,"Overall, this book is worth reading. She goes through the fundamentals of how to become wealthier in a hurry. First, boost your income dramatically; second build equity in investments (usually rental properties). Another principle, of course, is to pay yourself first, which Loral advocates. Loral's approach is to get people to think about how to boost their income within their given interests and skill sets; and how to run a business. She uses her own terminology (i.e ""gap analysis"" and some other buzzwords that you have to get used to) but overall her logic is easy to follow. She goes through a number of scenarios with her before and after illustrations of people's situations. This book might really benefit people that are entrepreneurial minded - but haven't quite found their calling yet or haven't been able to hit their income goals."
1,Unrealistic and unoriginal,"The stories in this book are totally unrealistic when you analyse the numbers, tax consequences and facts. These stories should not be followed by the average Joe. If you really want to be inspired to move forward, read Rich Dad Poor Dad by Kiyosaki and Lechter. After all, many of the general concepts here about building wealth, building businesses or getting to the point of living off of passive income are ""borrowed"" from Rich Dad Poor Dad. Can I get my money back?"
5,"The Millionaire Maker: Act, Think, and Make Money the Way the Wealthy Do",MS Langmeier proofs that poverty belongs in the museums and that every person has the potential for a life of wealth. People like her rekindle hope in others.
1,Don't bother,"Very little actionable advice, the book is heavily padded with repetive tables and figures that if rationalized would probably drop it under 150 pages. I felt that the true purpose of this book was to market the author's seminars, to get me to follow up with them so they could sell me their coaching services.One of my favorite lines was that real estate is a ""continually appreciating asset"". She obvoiusly was not doing this in the 80s and given recent times may want to put out a new edition.There are much better books in this category."
4,A good book with a good plan!,"I found this book to be very helpful to the average college graduate. It would make an excellent graduation gift. It presents great ideas on how to change how you look at money so that you will be successful with it, and how to create and hang onto wealth.- Aimee Elizabeth, Author of Poverty Sucks! How to Become a Self-Made Millionaire."
5,"Harmonic disk, beautiful entirety","I've listened this now about two months and five times a week. Beautiful and classic retro music, which really affect your feelings."
2,Stage Comedy,This CD is difficult to follow because it consist of the dialogue for comedy performed on stage. Without the visual it is difficult to 'get it' at times. The item was delivered quickly and in a timely manner.
1,"""A must un-keep""","After reading ""Captivated"" I was ""so-like"" Board with the stories...The Heros were ""BLANK"""
2,*NOT A FAVOURITE*,"I love Susan Johnson novels! But this was okay, not a favourite of mine. So, so. Just okay on the erotic. Hope this helps."
4,Not perfect... but excellent,"I would have to say that after reading this book, I decided that it is fascinating and extaordinarily well-written, but I don't agree with anyone who makes it sound perfect. A few things I didn't like: 1) The second half of the book is tedious, each chapter ending with another ""realization"" which is essentially the same as the last realization. 2) Ellison is obviously a very deep thinker and complex man, but he sometimes takes it too far and his meaning becomes too obscure. 3) He doesn't make his concluding point at all clear in the epilogue. Besides these things, I loved the book. It is insightful, and gives a human face to the oppression of african-americans, without being whiney or predictable. The writing style isn't hard to follow, which puts more emphasis on the substance, of which there is much. Overall, I'd say that to enjoy this book, be prepared for the 3 things I described, but it is definitely essential reading."
5,find your identity!,"This book (along with 1984) have been instrumental in my quest to find out what type of person I want to be. This book is not simply about the search for a black identity, but the identity of anyone who feels that their life is being defined by others (a scary prospect)."
5,Ellison Evokes,"I originally read this superb book back in my High School days. Required reading and all. And recently rediscoverd Mr. Ellison's masterpiece when my oldest son was raving to me about the book he HAD to read!In ""Invisible Man"", we never actually know the narrator...he is invisible in name, but, in bringing us his nightmarish journey cross racial divides, he is very high profile.We travel with him from the Deep South to the ravaged streets of Harlem. Where men are men and African American men are reduced to fighting animals to survive.Reading this profound tome again, I have renewed my faith as well as my fright of human behavior. An excellent book to read, share and remember.Thanks--CDS"
2,This printing: Full of typos!,"This is NOT an editorial review. The criticism is for the terrible quality of this particular printing. My daughter is reading this book for a class, and she has found an unacceptable number of typos: Letters missing, zero's instead of ""o""s, 1's instead of L's. Ten dollars is a very reasonable price, but the typo's are distracting in such an intellectually intense work and we would have purchased a different issue if we had known about the poor quality of this one."
1,Long and boring,"The narrator gets kicked out of school in the South and ends up in Harlem, New York. He works as a speaker for an organization and becomes a part of the Brotherhood. The Brothers are starting chaos and riots in the streets of Harlem and the narrator does not agree with this. Reading the book to find out what the ending is done at your own risk!I am a senior in high school and had to read Invisible Man as an English assignment. I would not waste my time on this book again. The narrator's role is written poorly, some chapters don't make sense, and it is extremely long and boring- I could even say it lacks substance.Do not waste $19.30 on this book!"
5,One of the most inspiring books,"As an African-American, I can say that this book is part of my cultural history. I am truly moved by its message. Ellison is a GENIUS, too often forgotten in literary classes...."
3,Interesting book,"This book is philosophical and many questions about humanity are rhetorically asked. I gained a lot of perspective from this book. The issue with the book is that the author gave numerous minute details that was irrelevant to the story as a whole. At times, it became tedious. Overall, an inspiring book."
4,Wonderful and Disappointing. Great listen but abrupt ending,"Recently, I had the opportunity to listen to Joe Morton's outstanding reading of Ralph Ellison's The Invisible Man. The reading was superb in everyway and Mr. Morton deserves the highest praise. However, I was surprised to discover the last chapter and the epilogue are not included on the tape. I found this to be a terrible omission and need clarification. Was this intentional on Random House's part, since the last chapter and the epilogue are essential to the novel? The tape ran to the very end. It was the eleventh tape in an eleven tape unabridged box set, and therefore its omission was startling if not incomprehensible to what had been the best listening experience of the summer."
4,This book showed truth that no one wants to see-prejudice.,"Ellsion showed the cruelty of manknid. We can be so cruel. So cruel that sometimes, people may feel like the world just goes on a round them. They are confused why. They feel like the world ingores them, and they don't like being ingored. As the main character says, ""I am not invisible that nobody can see me, I am invisible because they choose not to."""
1,Not what I ordered,"What is shown in the picture and what I received were two completely different items. The second view looks like someone airbrushed off the rest of the earring to give a ""close up"" which looks more like the item I received. Sorely, sorely disappointed.I will not be ordering from this supplier in the future."
2,Not What I Expected,"This book was not what I expected. After reading other books by this author, I was unhappy about the sex in it. At the 50% mark of the book the sex started. It was very well written, I just did not want to read in detail, about the sexual encounters. I requested a refund and stopped reading the book, which I almost never so. This book and the sexual content was very well written and done in good taste. Just not to my taste."
3,No more than 3!,"Learnt that flavored coffee is the least quality coffee for the flavoring will disguise its faults. We drank the Millstone Ground Coffee, Vanilla Nut Cream, 1.75-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12) and grew tired of the smell and taste. Much better to add your own essence of your preferred flavor. Learning about good coffee takes a while and eventually one becomes discerning and somewhat more demanding in their choices. For the time the price was decent so 3 Stars for this one."
2,Not quite as you might expect,"This garlic press is much, much heavier than a typical garlic press, and you have to remove the ""beak"" to use it, so it doesn't even resemble an animal while in use. The beak is supposed to be used as a garlic-press scraper, but I am sure the beak would eventually become separated and lost - and then this garlic press would be a heavy, unidentifiable, and not very useful piece of plastic (or whatever it is made of). I gave it two stars because I presume it would actually press garlic."
5,GE 4 way Distribution Amplifier WORKS !,"I am using all four ""outs"" for a cable tv forty foot line, from source box. I have one amp (another brand) near the source box. I have the GE amplifier on the side of the line, closer to the tv sets. I know this thing works, because I have some excellent televisions and a cheap television hooked to it. I get max everything on the good televisions, and all I should expect to get on the cheap tv. Without the GE amplifier all suffer signal loss, which you never want to experience with any tv."
1,Worse than without,"I bought this GE 4-way amplifier (mine is in a silver case) from Home Depot to strengthen the signal from my pre-digital UHF-VHF attic antenna. I hooked a single digital TV to the output. Unfortunately, after installation I saw MORE pixelation and ADDITIONAL instances of total signal loss on several TV stations. NONE were improved. In short, my digital picture and sound were significantly better before installation and after removal of this amplifier. I'd give this zero stars if possible."
1,NOTHING TO RECOMMEND,There is nothing to recommend in this badly acted and extremely tedious film. BORING BOREING BORING. Don't try loking for an intelligent script as there isn't one.
1,out-sized with a design flaw,"I am 5' 5"" and weigh 110 lbs. Small framed and athletic. With the straps fully adjusted until they could go no smaller, this barely fit me, but because the nikon shoulder pads are thicker than the movable binocular rings, it was unasable for a small framed person."
2,Did anybody measure?,"The elastic pieces were not cut to the same length. Therefor, there is an 8"" difference in strap adjustment lengths. This made it almost impossible, without the help of someone else, to adjust the straps by yourself. The NIKON shoulder pad on one side was not able to pad the shoulder because it could not slide over plastic strap adjuster 'thing'; it had to be 8 inches higher on that side. The plastic clips are CHEAP, to say the least, and using a metal keyring and a plastic connector was also cheap. GREAT idea, but since I bought mine I have seen several other higher quality harnesses. I would definitely NOT recommend this product."
1,"Junk battery, not new, but sold as new",The battery I received is not new; the seller listed it as a new one. The battery does not even last for 12 hours without any talk time. DO NOT BUY IT.....no wonder the shipping charger are more than the price of the battery. Just a waste of money.
1,customer,"i bought this cellphone battery and it won't even last a day long, won't hold the charge even for the entire day,very disappointed with this product"
2,Not all that!,They spent more of the book on talking to crafters than info about the craft. Not worth buying!!!!Sorry~Kamilla
3,The good comes with the bad...,"This book is only mediocre as far as craft books go. Yes, the pictures and commentary are amusing but as far as the projects are concerned, I didn't find them very appealing. They were fairly average in design and creativity and weren't really worth the money to buy the book. It was an entertaining book if you want to read other peoples' craft exploits though."
2,not different,i thought this book would be unique while it tries to be it does not spark any creativity for me.
2,Crafter's Journal Not Project Book,I had high hopes for this book but upon receiving it was very confused. It took me awhile to figure out where the stories about each crafter ended and where their particular craft project started. TO be honest I could care less about these weirdo crafters and how they discovered their love for fake dreadlocks. Also there were barely any crafts in this book and out of the eight there were really only two I would ever be interested in doing. Everyone knows how to make a bowl out of a record and if not it is very accessible online just like every other project in this book. I also did not like how there were only a few pictures in the book. I have a hard time making things without knowing how they are supposed to turn out. All in all unless you like reading about other people's craft lives this book is not worth the money.
4,good little movie,this movie was well acted and a quaint little film. worth the money to buy and add to your dvd collection
4,For the expert knitter,"This book is a visual feast. Even though these designs are from around 1990, the garments shown would be a delight to own. However, this is NOT a book for the inexperienced knitter, and the intermediate knitter would need to be well-versed in the various color knitting techniques. It can in no way be considered an instructional work.But if you are looking for inspiration, or just some great designs to drool over, this book is definitely worth owning."
1,Honeywell Thermometer,The product worked very well for six months or so then the batteries went dead; after replacing the batteries it lasted about 3 weeks; now the out door temperature device dosen't work.
2,Gift purchase,I purchased this item as a gift for my parents but I was not as impressed with this style of Indoor/Outdoor thermometer as I was with one I had purchsed for myself from L.L. Bean several years previous.
3,I expected better-,"Ok, I liked this book, but I was hoping for more. I am a big fan of Linda Howard.I read the previous reviews and couldn't wait to get the book. I was disappointed.I was hoping for a little more suspense-I personally like twists and turns but this was pretty straightforward-no guessing-I like to be on the edge of my seat! And I like humor added in-which there wasn't much. I liked Open Season and her other books. If you like her stuff, read this but don't have high expectations.Maybe that's what ruined it for me."
4,The best since Mr. Perfect,"Sarah is my hero! She is so tough, but not self-agrandizing. She is a welcom change from Open Season's Daisy, who was a feather pillow for anyone to toss around. The mystery and romance here were a bit on the weak side, but Sarah's character more than made up for it as far as I am concerned. A must buy."
4,Excellent!,"I loved the book, the hero and heroine together were explosive. My only complaint is the villain seemed to have little or no motive for what he did, and because we could not get into his character fully, we could not gett fully frightened by him. He was bascially motiveless, and background info on his was not followed through and left me guessing and unconvinced. Having said that, this is still one book you will have to read in one sitting."
2,NOT HER BEST!!,"THIS WAS NOT EVEN AN AVERAGE BOOK. THE PLOT OF THE BOOK SUCKED REALLY BAD. THE BAD GUY IS AN OLD GEEZER WHO IS A BIG PERVERT AND COMES TOTALLY OUT OF LEFT FIELD. THE ONLY REASON I AM EVEN GIVING THIS BOOK 2 STARS ARE BECAUSE OF THE LOVE SCENES WERE VERY SPICY AND KINKY. OTHER THAN THAT THIS BOOK HAD NOTHING ELSE. I TYPICALLY READ LINDA HOWARD'S BOOKS WITHIN DAYS (GOTTA EAT, SLEEP AND GO TO WORK) BUT FOR SOME REASON I HAD A VERY HARD TIME TRYING TO FINISH THIS ONE. IT TOOK ME ALMOST A WHOLE WEEK TO FINISH IT. I JUST WAS NOT INTO IT AND THANK GOD I ONLY PAID 50 CENTS AT A DISCOUNT BOOK STORE."
1,Not Linda Howard's best book,"I have read quite a few Linda Howard books, and was excited to start this book. However, by the time I was halfway through it, I was bored. I found the characters were not believable, and the interactions between them, had no depth, or interest. Overall, I found it to be a very poor example of a Linda Howard book, and one that I would not recommend."
5,Gripping Suspense,No one writes books like Linda Howard. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Excellent book.
2,"Linda Howard, Dying to Please","I have been a fan of Linda Howard, but I feel in her recent book that she is putting too much emphasis on sex and forgetting that the main focus should be on the story. I will think twice before I buy a hardcover book of hers again."
2,Just not up to Linda Howard standards.,"I have always enjoyed all of Linda Howards books since she first began writing. Her men are always dynamic and make you wish they were real. This book was an absolute disappointment. The intrugue was great, but the characters, especially Cahill, just never seemed to develop. When I gave it my neighbor, who I swap books with, especially Linda Howard's, I told her to pass it on, I didn't want it back. It was the one Linda Howard book that I would not be keeping in my collection. I hope her next book lives up to my expectations."
2,disappointing,"I usually read the Linda Howard books but find her output uneven. Some good, some not so good. Nothing wrong with the writing per se, but sometimes they tend to the banal. I'm sick of the psycho type killers. I feel this one was written by the numbers. Hot sex, but that's not enough to make a book good. I'll probably pick up her next one, hoping that she'llbe back up to form."
4,"Great, fast paced read!","I love Linda Howard and this book didn't disappoint! Its original which I loved. There wasn't your usual, run of the mill characters with the same old complications and occupations. I loved Cahill, he was a great hero; all sexy and scorned by his ex wife. And Sarah was a fascinating heroine. The fact that she was a butler made it interesting without an overly traditional feel. She was great. I liked that they both had hang ups and were real. The villian was truly creepy!!! The suspense was great and gets you hooked straight away! Definitely recommended!"
5,"Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael",It showed real teenage emotions. I wish Hollywood made more movies of this kind.
5,A very moving experience for me,Reading this book was a moving experience for me as a therapist. I found Marcia Hill's observations to range from mildly amusing to profoundly wise. She modeled the kind of vulnerability within a framework of integrity which no doubt makes her a very special clinician. She has the ability to laugh at herself and the profession while it is obvious she is deeply committed to her clients and her vocation. I would recommend this book to anyone who wonders about what makes good therapy.
5,Gunsmoke memories,This set of Gunsmoke-The First Season dvds is excellent. It brings back so many memories of my childhood. These were my heros. These should be the heros of kids today. I have been waiting for this set to become available and I have not been disappointed. Everyone who grew up in the fifties and sixties should see this collection.
5,Nostalgia,"My husband got be started watching the old Gunsmoke Series on tv, the only problem was I wanted to see the episodes from the very beginning. These are not shoot em up cowboy shows these actually have a storyline to them. I just love watching them can't wait for the second season to come out."
5,Hesten's favorite,"Very good movie and one of Heston's favorites. Not a ""traditional"" western, but one of my favorites. Well acted and entertaining."
4,Despite Some Odd Choices This is A Pretty Solid Western,Will Penny starts off very strong. The cinematography and setting (it was shot in the Eastern Sierra) are fabulous. Heston is very believable as an aging cowboy near the end of the trail. The romantic elements are well acted and stay on the right side of cheesiness for the most part. The element of this film that detracted from it's overall quality was the casting and acting of the family of villains Will encounters. Some of the scenes they are in are actually weirdly out of sorts with the rest of the film. It's like Lonesome Dove meets the Manson family for a few minutes. Overall it's a 60s Western well worth watching for Heston's performance and the mostly solid script.
2,"Heaven help us from newbie Western ""afficionados!""","Wow, this is truly one of the worst westerns I have ever seen. A ""minor classic""? I dont think so. And who cares if Heston ""becomes Will Penny""? A solid individual performance but not enough to overcome a weak storyline, and even weaker script.Had the director followed the classic formula and left the ubiquitous Joan Hackett in the background that may have been enough to salvage this turkey. As it is, she occupies way to much of the screen and THAT is a major distraction. But if you like the creeping sentimentality of mush like Rooster Cogburn, the Shoot Out, and that silly out of place ""Raindrops"" scene in Butch Cassidy then you will probably love this thing.The DVD transfer is nothing spectacular, I'd give the video/audio *** and the soundtrack gets *. What a dud, I think the producers of Walking Tall used this soundtrack as inspiration. You've been warned. Wish I hadnt bought this."
1,"a going-nowhere, nothing told film","what's the purpose of this pathetic film with pathetic small timers from the very beginning to the end? there's almost no story at all about this film. guy is just a good-for-nothing guy like all the other characters. he can kill but has no guts to settle down and to take care a woman and a kid? ""i'm 50 years old now, i can't settle down (even she offered doing the farming)all i know is being a cowhand...."" so just drift away with the other two cow punchers? what kind of logic is this? and what is the purpose of this whole movie? the only watchable thing in this totally clueless movie is the beautiful scenery."
1,Over rated,This book is not as good as i thought it would be. I hope i have better readings with Bryan Tracy's Advance selling.
2,One extreme to the other,"This book is all about extremes. It describes lighting and materials in very simple terms and then proceeds to list the complex equations involved. There doesn't seem to be any middle ground.I understand that metal is shiny and that tree bark is rough and bumpy. But going from that to the complex equations is quite a leap. I was hoping for a book that explained objects in relation to the settings that 3d programs like 3ds Max use to create their materials...Diffuse, Specular, Glossiness, etc. etc.I would only recommend this book to you if you can make use of the complex equations used to produce realistic lighting."
4,Best option I've found,"They don't glide perfectly smooth, but they protect the floors well, and hammer in so they attach very securely. Well made. I would buy again."
2,Not the first one.,"This movie wasn't horrible. It was just lacking the humor of the first one. ""They Call Me Bruce"" was a laugh-riot. ""They Still Call Me Bruce"" was a little more serious, and just didn't come off as well. He was supposed to be a wanna-be Bruce Lee, hurting himself more than those around him, and winning by luck alone. If they had released it on it's own, and not as ""They still call me bruce"", I feel it would have done better."
3,Ruthless Trust,"Fast shipping. Book is older than what was described as ""like new"" condition. Pages are yellow and seems very old."
5,Spiritual Growth,Ordered this book as a gift. It arrived within the given time and was well packaged. Ordered new book and pricing was very fair. Good buy.
4,very clean scent,"If you're a fan of any of the Kai products, you will need to add this to your morning ritual. It feels so silky smooth on the skin and the fragrance is fabulous. A must have."
3,The forerunner of minimalist grunge guitar,"I really love this album, 'though I know I shouldn't in the ""snob"" sense. Lightnin' Hopkins is simply my favorite electric guitar player. I like every single song on this album -- Lightnin' is like a sprightly John Lee Hooker when he goes electric. I prefer Lightnin' plugged in to unplugged. Plugged in he's something else entirely. ""Brand New Automobile"" and ""Mr. Charlie (Pt. II)"" are slow grinding wonders. I keep going back to this low-budget enterprise time and again, and really enjoy it. Well worth the piddly-squat price!"
4,this allows my EMR to function,The speech mike allows me to turn on and off the speech recognition software easily enough that entering data in my EMR is easier and quicker than writing by hand. I have not used other products but the accuracy is very good. There is always room for improvement. I can't tell what is the microphone not picking up what I'm saying and what is the dragon not transcribing what it's hearing. Overall I'm happy with this product.
5,A more positive opinion,"This fine watch was a recent Christmas gift. So far it's flawless, both in appearance and accuracy, and being a well-made Seiko I expect it will remain so for any years. From experience with my older Seiko watch, they're meant for life in the real world.A short comment on an old previous review (above): I don't know what kind of ""Seiko"" the reviewer had, but the Hardlex crystal didn't scratch on a cotton shirt. That's just not physically possible. It's hardness is midway between mineral glass and sapphire. Hardlex is every bit as good as sapphire in everyday use. It's also more flexible and far less prone to shatter than sapphire. For that reason NASA specifies hardlex crystals for their Astronauts' Omega watches.BTW, this beautiful, high quality watch is a real bargain at the current $157 price."
2,The useful part is available elsewhere,"While this back-to-front read might be an interesting conversation starter to place on your coffee table, Achron's Oct. 7 review is correct -- the text comprises a preface by L. Sprague de Camp (which is also reprinted in the more useful http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1568820704/002-9569671-8448844 ) and 16 repeating pages of fake language.Don't be fooled. The Necronomicon doesn't exist, and de Camp's preface is available in a book that contains more you can actually read."
3,Fact: its fiction,"Contrary to popular belief, there is no such Necronomicon in the British Museum. If anybody has seen or claims to have studied this completely fictional book, produce photographs. If the book exisits so do photos. No one translates from original texts. this book is cool for for props or if you take it for what it is. fiction. The ""Arabic"" is a nice touch. (If anyone wants a good laugh, find somone who can read it!)"
5,Al Azif,"...i must say,for those that think the necronomicon ie. al azif is a joke,fake,or in the true text in any way fraudulent;hasn't truly taken the time to study and research the semeticism of the text. after spending the last twelve years studying this text in corilation with a few others,such as the LEMMEGEDON;the little key,ie the KEY of SOLOMAN;the SUSSEX manuscript;the LEYDON PAPYRUS;and the writings of Alberta Magnus, just to name a few. though crude in the english text, i truly believe without proper research no piece literature should be blindly accused as fake..."
3,Wha???,"I've been looking at this book for a while now and I haven't been able to decide whether to shell out the 20 bucks for it or not. Why? Because there are two opinions about this book, the common one is that it is real and was written by Abdul Alhazred and the second is the great American writer HP Lovecraft made this up. Because of these, I can't decide whether or not to buy it....Does anyone really know?"
2,uh..... yeah,"Interesting read, didn't buy it as real for a single moment.Just to put a finer point on this, the necronomicon never existed, -never-.In fact you will never find any mention of it -prior- to 1922, and I challenge those of you who think it did to provide proof and links (if any are to be had) otherwise your arguments fall flat and your cries ""IT'S REAL! IT WORKS!"" are nothing more than self-induced delusion.So please crawl back down into your parents basement and stop with the irrational ravings."
5,Good Stuff,"Live At Billy Bob's. This CD was exactly as advertised. It was delivered on time, and in new condition. What more can you ask for? Good Stuff!"
4,More Answers Than You Would Expect!,"I read Out on a Limb when I was fourteen-years-old, and the book acknowledged every doubt and every idea that I had thought of growing up with Christian ideals: fate, the afterlife, the soul, etc. Shirley MacLaine introduces her personal faith from the beginning and systematically details her progression into the spiritual teacher that she is to this day. MacLaine also seems to possess a sixth sense as to the questions that her readers will encounter as they read her novel and answers them in a very clear and concise manner (if you're not careful, the material can be quite daunting).My only outstanding complaint about this novel is that MacLaine had to account for every facet of her and Jerry's relationship. It proved to be quite distracting and I did not feel that Jerry's extra-marital affair with Shirley was necessary for a book of this nature."
3,I donated to the public library......,I donated to the public library......good but not great.....Out on a Limb.....I read a zillion books ....it was entertaining...I've always like Shirley Mcclaine!~
5,Pleasant surprise,"Just a great second release from Deadsy. I perfect maturing of their sound and my favorite album by them. A truely unique band that has so much to offer. New wave/goth/rock and just completely irresisable and rich synthesized music. Favorite tracks ""The Last Story Ever,"" ""Phantasmagore,"" ""Book Of Black Dreams."" I highly recommend this album to previous fans and newcomers alike."
3,Cannibal Corpse - 'Gallery of Suicide' (Metal Blade),"Personally,I liked the CD before this one,'Vile' better.Don't get me wrong,'Gallery...' is decent.There's no mistaken George 'Corpsegrinder' Fisher's trademark bowel-from-way-below like vocals on about every track here.The most head-riveting cuts are ""Blood Drenched Execution"",the very unpleasant-sounding ""Dismembered"",""Chambers Of Blood"" and ""Every Bone Broken"".Overall,another fairly good thrash catalog title.Another sick cover from CC.Very likely to have been banned at Kmarts and Walmarts everywhere.I've often mentioned how in past recent years I've 'sort of' grown out of this genre of music.However,I happen to catch the band out on their current 'Wretched Spawn' tour and all I can say is that I think I appreciate their intense energy more than I do their music."
3,Enter the Gallery of Suicide,"Cannibal Corpse have always been loyal to their fans have never sold out in any way. Their sixth full length studio album ""Gallery of Suicide"" is a decent offering. George""Corpsegrinder""Fisher still relies on both the high pitched shrieking and cookie monster vocal styles especially in the song ""Blood Drenched Execution"". Just like most of their albums ""Gallery of Suicide"" focuses highly on shock value in their lyrics. Musically it seems that Cannibal Corpse have improved some. One of the songs on ""Gallery of Suicide"" that I believe music was one of the main focuses was the title track which is ""Gallery of Suicide"". They still have grinding guitars, ripping solos, blasphemous bass, cookie monster, and a double bass drum. This album has very little to offer fans as it can be found boring at some times. Some songs prove to be better than others, but ""Gallery of Suicide"" is a decent album."
1,this is ridiculous,"this is not music, it is a guy growling, blast beats , and simple guitars. there s no atmosphere at all. it is just mind-blowing noise."
3,An improvement from Vile,"Finaly this album you can say its a Cannibal album. I mean you just couldnt compare Vile with the earlier stuff they did. With Gallery they show an improvement from Vile, specially Fisher who bettered his vocals in this one. It's really slower then Vile, eventually gets boring. But its a good album, comparable with their earlier stuff, with Barnes, worst, but comparable. If you liked this you will probably love Bloodthirst, and if you liked Vile you will love this."
1,"Why can't i use ""0"" stars","Well, i have to say that i'm a lover of all sorts of music. But this stuff is crap. I think that anybody that likes it needs to re-evaluate their lives and stop listening to such garbage."
3,Where are the missing songs?,"The first Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album was a classic. It needs to be re-issued in it's entirety. I have been looking for it for years. I already own their second album(CD) ""Ricochet"" so buying this CD would be a waste as I am only getting half the songs of the first album and some of the best were left off. Anyone who feels the same should also write a review and perhaps we can get the producers to give us one CD with their first two albums together in their entirety."
3,An entertaining collection of bad movies,"At $0.33 per movie, one should not expected academy award winning acting. This is a collection of some of the worst films ever. Bad special effects are everywhere. Bats on strings. Dogs in rugs. Classic stuff. Some of these films are truly strange. Others are gems. All of them are worth watching with friends over a bowl of popcorn. Just don't set your expectations too high and you will enjoy them greatly."
2,Lip Reader Needed!!,"I have owned the TV for 6 days. Picture looks great on HD content and ok on SD. Needs adjustment out of box. Do NOT buy for the Picture in Picture feature. To Switch your choice of pictures sound you must pull up menu. Choose sound then input. Now the killer. SOUND has cut out on me way to many times. My older tv (Sony) never lost sound, ever and NO tv should! So it is not my $89.00 HDMI Cable. You expect to make adjustments to a TV, Color, Tint, Contrast etc. NOT to this sound problem. Defective item is being returned. NOT recommended."
5,Samsung Plasma HDTV,"For around a grand, this is a top notch product. HD looks amazing (PS3 source), SD looks OK, and with an upconverting DVD player, SD DVD movies look surprisingly crisp. The sound this television produces is mediocre, though the surround sound option does create a more 3-D sound ambience. The Game Mode sounds intriguing, although, as far as I can tell, it is fairly useless. If anything it makes games look worse than they should. I spent quite a while calibrating the picture settings, and have come up with a pretty good combination that can be applied to all the video formats (dynamic/standard/movie). Try these out for yourself!Contrast = 85Brightness = 56Sharpness = 65Color = 45Tint = 50G/50RColor Tone = Cool 2These settings seem to make all SD/HD movies look outstanding!I highly recommend this product."
2,Great TV but unreliable,"This unit was I thought for the first two months a great bargin. Then it started recyling at turn on, then refused to turn on at all. All I got was a black screen and a blue light. Contacted Samsung and they said I needed service. Service never called or showed for appointment. Now I have a different service provider, TV has been down over a week and will be at least another one. Samsung is trying but In my over 60 years I never had a TV go out within 55 daysof delivery."
5,Good Classic,What a differenct world it would be if every Christian family could follow this excellent prayer guide. What if we all prayed for our families like this? Easy to read but important encouragement for families to pray for each other.
5,Expanded my baking reportoire!,"I've been baking for some time, but was having a difficult time whenever recipes measured ingredients using the metric system. This scale is light and accurate. Now I can make Algerian and French goodies without any trouble. The tare feature works great; no need for directions for this one. The colors are a great bonus."
5,Excellent,"I've had this scale for almost a year and it is awesome! I have no complaints. It is easy to use and accurate. The most common thing I use it for is measuring out snacks into single portions in individual baggies. It is a must-have for cooks, bakers, and portion-conscious people. Also, I have yet to replace the battery."
3,It works,"Not too much to say. Its a scale. It does its job. Cheap, durable. I use it to measure ingredients for beer brewing at home."
3,Good scale,I gave this 3 stars because after using it for a year I've found that the viewing window gets covered by a large bowl and my first one only lasted a year. They are supposed to be guaranteed so I'll be sending the old one in for replacment.
4,IS NICE,"Saves me a lot of time when weighing my drugs, when saves the homicide division a lot of time because bodies don't pile up.This thing is fantastic though, firealz."
3,Nifty Scale,"The Escali Primo is a good scale for measuring small items. The buttonology is a bit confusing at first, but you get used to it with a little more study of the owners manual."
4,Does what it is supposed to,Scale does what it is supposed to. Scale seems to be built rather cheaply. I still would recommend it.
4,No complaints! :),"Product perfectly suits my needs. I wanted the scale to weigh small food items, such as cheese, and it's worked well so far. I have no complaints!"
5,Great kitchen gadget to have!,"I recently purchased my 2nd Escali scale and love it even more than the first one I purchased 5 years ago. I weigh everything whether I'm cooking or baking and this scale does not disappoint. I had to buy a 2nd one because the display cover came off, the scale still worked though. I also got the pink one to go with my pink Kitchen Aid mixer and food processor."
5,A must have!,"The only thing I can think of to improve this device is to add a slot or hole on the bottom so you can hang it up. It's big and flat so it takes up a lot of real estate in a kitchen drawer.Also, the instructions fail to mention that you can turn off the device if you hold the on/off button down for about 5 seconds."
4,escali scale works well,"the scale has served us well, being easy to use with an apparent auto shut-off for batt. conservation..........so far so good....not too expensive....can double as a light postage scale (our primary use)....dual read-out capable in lbs. or grams"
5,Works very well,I've had this for a while now. It works very well and is easy to use. The zero tare feature is nice to have when you have a bowl or something on there and want to add a certain weight. You can even do the same and remove weight.
1,Not accurate!,"All the other reviews were so good that I bought one for myself and for a friend. The accuracy varies. I used certified weights and found that the scale produced variances of 10-15%. In fact, it doesn't weigh the same item the same weight twice in a row! A friends scale had the same problem. I threw it away (a waste) and bought another one."
1,Broke after about a year of occasional use,"I owned it for about a year using it about once a month and when I most recently pulled it out of the cupboard to use it, all that would show on the display was ""out2"". Changing the batteries had no effect. I don't recall abusing it with water or too much weight, and certainly, it was working when I last used it."
4,Weighty item.,"Great little scale. Easy to operate. Results shown in grams or ounces. Does not show lbs. You must convert ounces into lbs. manually (bummer).As a separate item you can purchase a tray that fits on top of the scale, therefore making for easier cleanup."
1,I guess I am the unlucky one...,"Specifically purchased this item given the many positive comments. Unfortunately, I can't add to the long list of rave reviews.I received the product, put in the included batteries and then neither of the two buttons would work. I couldn't get the 'tare' function to work and then I couldn't get the 'off' button to work. It did however eventually turn off on its own. In addition, after a few minutes, the scale started reading a couple of ounces even with nothing on the scale. The scale was on the counter top (flat obviously) and was not near any other electronics.I assumed my problems were a fluke; I processed a return and Amazon had a replacement scale on my door step in two days (Amazon worked perfectly during the return process). I had similar, but not exactly the same issues with the second scale; I returned it as well.Oh well, I guess I'll try another product now."
2,Not consistently accurate,"When using gram measurements I could lift an item off the scale and put it back down and come up with a different weight. Using the tare function often gave me a weight off by a gram or two.If you are measuring yeast for example, the difference between 2 or 3 grams is a lot, percentage wise and baking wise.Sending it back."
2,Did not last,"This scale worked very well for 6 months. Then it developed a problem that rendered it unusable. When the scale is powered on it never settles at zero. Initially the display started to fluctuate from +/-2g. Eventually the scale's display would simply start increasing up as high as 30g. Cycling through the units, taring, and changing batteries do not correct this behavior. The unit is stored upright in a clean drawer with no weight resting on it. I am not sure if anything can remedy this issue. The scale can not be recalibrated."
3,so-so,This scale looks cool but it feels cheap. It feels like a really inexpensive plastic. The digital reading isn't all that dependable either. I was sort of disappointed.
1,TERRIBLE scale,"I bought this scale after reading all the great reviews on Amazon but unfortunately, it did not work for me. It was too flimsy and light-weight (I'm used to using scientific scales which are much heavier) and it did not tare correctly (the display was stuck on something illegible) within the first 2 times I used it. I returned the scale and will buy something sturdier.Save yourself the trouble and don't get this scale."
5,Great kitchen scale,This is a fantastic little kitchen scale. It works great for weighing the flour when I'm baking and it's very simple to use. Has a nice high weight limit.
3,I like it!,"The scale is very accurate.I bought Metallic one. The picture looked shiny and very metallic. But the real scale is little (a lot) different from the picture you see. It is not shiny, it's just gray plastic.But I don't care much about the looks as long as it works."
5,Certainly not what I expected,"There are many good songs on this album, and they all pretty much differ from each other greatly. Although, the sound of this album doesn't always fit with what most people would probably think Maddy Prior working with Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull would be.There seems to be less things settled musically in this album, like perhaps the musicians were not completely in their element, working in awkward conditions, or maybe that's just me.Nevertheless this is an extremely enjoyable album. Prior's songwriting abilities shine very bright. I bought this for my girlfriend a while back for her birthday, and she really did enjoy it. So it definitely did it's job.Thanks Maddy!"
2,2.5 Stars,"Do not be deceived. There is little of Ian Anderson on this disc. He produced a couple of cuts and is credited for playing the flute on one, the standout cut on the disc, Gutter Goose. Martin Barre plays guitar, also on one cut, the mediocre Cold Flame. Yes Barriemore Barlow plays drums on 7 of the 11 tracks but is so restrained (with the exception of the flute solo on Gutter Geese) that his presence seems wasted. John Glascock plays on 4 cuts but also seems to be under-utilized. The problem lies in both Prior's compositions (weak) and the talent of the remaining musicians-they come across as second rate studio musicians. Stick with Prior's work with Steeleye Span in the seventies. She is at her best interpreting English folk songs to the energy of Steeleye Span of that period. Gutter Geese aside, this one's just not very good..Simon"
1,Sweet,"I read this book a while back and it was one of the first Barbara Delinsky novels I had ever read. The story was slow to build, which is usually the case for Barbara Delinsky novels, the characters were all unique and unforgettable, the way most characters are in small town romances, and the writing itself is good. Barbara Delinsky allows us(the readers)to project ourselves in Lake Henry almost unconsciously, I worried about Heather's fate, and the humongous chip on Poppy's shoulder; I sympathized with Griffin and felt sorrow for Micah. The characters in this book are not very deep, and yet, not terribly cliché, 'The accidental woman' is pretty good read.RECOMMENDED"
2,Poorly written and even poorly edited...,Literally every sentence of this book is filled with grammatical and spelling errors. It does get quite annoying at times to read through the text.The illustrations and diagrams are of poor quality. I bought this book as the author is quite renowned in the field of stress stesting. I think it would have been a great book if only someone had taken the time to proof read and edit the text before publishing it.
3,Low profile design carries the roof box inside the garage,"The low profile foot kit allows minimal height increase. I was able to keep the overall height with Thule Atlantis 1800 under 7 feet, and squeeze the car inside the garage.I did noticed that in some cold days my sliding sunroof would stuck under the bar. However the convenience of entering the garage outweighes the underestimation of sunroof clearance."
4,Good except for plastic covers,"These fit our 2007 Kia Rondo as expected, however, the cheap plastic locking pin doesn't do a very good job of keeping the plastic cover on each of these. I've still only been able to (barely) get 3 out of 4 of them on. I read another review elsewhere that recommended the locking pin as a better alternative, so I'm going to try those. I don't suspect it will add any real security because you can pop the plastic covers off easily with just a screwdriver, but hopefully it will hold them in place a bit better."
4,"Pricey, but fun!!","Good review from Glenn Again that I agree with. I got mine and attached a baited fishing hook with a cork and used the boat to carry the line far back under boat docks. What a HOOT!!! Caught fish that rarely see a hook! Also, actually used the boat to fish with. I'm waiting for the BIG one that pulls the boat under!!"
5,Eating in Chinese,"When I was living in Taiwan this book was a lifesaver. I was teaching at a small university near Taipei in the early 80's. The only source of food was from the tiny restaurants that surrounded the side gate of the university. But to order I had to read the menus in Chinese! Luckily, I had brought McCawley's book with me, and was saved from starvation.The book has similar salutory value in American Chinese restaurants.Peter Cole"
4,"Fun reading, with occasional frustrations","A book by two people who specialize in recreating faces of historical figures from their skulls. This book covers some of their best known reconstructions: Philip of Macedon (father of Alexander the Great), King Midas, and Lindow Man to name a few. Most of the discussion is great fun (especially re: Philip), but the authors occasionally get a bit tedious (most notably they repeat, over and over again, the injunction not to judge how a face while in the process of reconstruction)."
4,Too quiet vocals?,"In response to some complaints that the vocals are too quiet in the mix, I have to agree. I personally feel all instrument voices should shine and contribute, not detract, from the overall sound. It creates an imbalance when one or more dominate (unless its a deliberate effect that is desired). It also creates an imbalance when you cant hear an instrument very well (think bass and piano in so many jazz recordings). Being able to discern the lyrics are not that important to me. Does it really matter what Liz Fraser of the Cocteau Twins is singing about? Or is it the sound of her voice thats important. I think Roberts voice would benefit greatly on this album with a bit more reverb, echo, delay-anything to get it out of the backroom and join the party. It still can be quiet, but it would then have presence."
4,"Actually, more like 35 minutes, and 17 seconds.","I own every Cure album, and ""Seventeen Seconds"" falls easily into my top five. Of the early few albums, I like it even more than ""Boy's Don't Cry"" or ""Faith"". There's just something about this one. I love the album cover, because it visually sets the mood before the music even begins. Many of these songs are almost hypnotic the way they're put together. They're very simple, yet still emotional at the same time. Favorites would be ""In Your House"", the dark ""At Night"", and the excellent title track. Oh, and there's this little song called ""A Forest"" that's probably one of the best Cure songs ever. In truth, you can't go wrong with any Cure disc from the 80's, but again I'd call this top ""Three"". There's a recent ""Deluxe"" version of this out also."
3,Be Careful If you use PNG format,"As a MAC user I had two excellent software choices for my photo manager - Apple's excellent photo manager or Adobe's. I tried both demos, but was not careful enough (why later). I found the Apple product to be both more powerful and more complex, in contrast Lightroom was available at a lower price and has an easier to learn interface. Plus my having the new Adobe Photoshop CS3 pushed me towards Lightroom.On price I chose Lightroom. Ooops! It does not support PNG and my work has numerous photos moved to that format. So now, I must hope they add PNG support!"
1,Printing a deal breaker,"Lot's of nice stuff in Lightroom, but you have to be a Photoshop expert to print properly. Unless you have the Color Management set just right you prints are going to look horrible and there is no, I repeat, no useful instructions on how to do this - only the vaguest of explanations that leave you looking for more explanations. The entire help text on Printer Color Management is less than 400 words and none of it actually tells you how to do anything. It tells you what Lightroom can do, but not how to do it. Any question you ask about Color Management on Adobe's website simply refer you back to Lightroom's Help/User Guide which, as I've said, has only the vaguest of explanations.I'm sure all this stuff is covered in Photoshop because Photoshop people who move to Lightroom don't seem to have any problem printing, but I'm not buying Photoshop.I'm really glad I used the 30 day trial. I'd be very upset if I'd spent any money on this product."
1,"The 18"" roll will not fit the smart easel.","The 18""easel paper that I ordered as an extra because my son loves to draw alot will not even fit on the easel. I have tried and retried but the spool of cardboard in the middle will not allow it to go on. I ended up having to cut sheets to fit the easel and clip them on. The smart easel itself is very nice but the replacement paper does not work with the easel. I am afraid to order more for fear of the same problem or of being mislead as the others reviews suggest."
1,Piece of junk,"This could actually be a pretty good stick if it wasn't for the fact that its calibration is constantly getting out of whack. I'm using the stick for flight sims only (mostly Warbirds) and I'm sick and tired of having to press F12 in the game to reset the stick's center position every 20 seconds or so. That makes this stick essentially useless to me.Another thing I noticed is that in the Windows game controller calibration page, the center position is constantly jittering ... as in not quite standing still (as all other sticks I've had to date would). If you need a good stick for a flight sim, stay away from this toy."
4,Kottke Live Is Simply Amazing,"I own very album Leo Kottke has ever released (including the long out-of-print Circle 'Round the Sun). I first bought this on vinyl as an import when it was released in 1980. For my money, no one plays guitar like Kottke. Most of these songs are from Kottke's Chrysalis albums. And since Chrysalis has deleted their entire Kottke catalog except Essential Leo Kottke, this is the only way to hear some of these Kottke gems. Highlights include the seven-minute-plus ""Open Country Joy: Theme and Adhesions."" This CD rerelease also adds two bonus cuts: the instrumental ""Range"" and Kottke's lovely version of the Tom T. Hall chestnut ""Pamela Brown,"" which first appeared on the Capitol album Ice Water. This album was recorded while Kottke was in Europe touring in support of Procol Harum. Even if you already own the studio versions of these songs, this will make a nice addition to your collection. RECOMMENDED"
2,Complete Cheerleading,This book has some basic information on stunt techniques. There are a few mistakes and some stunts and transitions aren't explained or represented very well.
4,A couple of great renditions of old favorites,"This album has two remakes of old favorites on it that are fantastic. One of them features Linda Ronstadt in a duet with Jeff on ""Hey, Good Lookin'"". I saw her perform with the band at Red Rocks, and it was something else. The other is a really different version of the Johnny Horton Hit ""The Battle of New Orleans"". Great guitar work on this one. I also really liked ""The Moon Just Turned Blue"". I've had this on an LP for years, and I dig it out once in a while and just turn it up real loud. Great album."
3,Didn't match,The image of the book and the one that came were different.I am going to have to buy a different book now.
1,A sickening story,"I am unsure about how this book became a classic this book is thoroughly disgusting! There is hardly even a plot and when there is any sort of conflict Pollyanna always comes in and saves the day before the story can get interesting. Every page I turned I was just waiting nervously for the ridiculous Pollyanna to declare ""I am so glad!"" I really despised how Porter made the stereotypical happy-go-lucky 1800's she could have realized that very soon there would be the Civil War. Eleanor Porter should have given this book to a soldier on the front lines then she might have seen that life is not all wines and roses. If you want to read a book about a girl in the 1800's read Anne of Green Gables."
1,Bo-ring!!!!,I don't think Eleanor H. Porter was thinking when she wrote Pollyanna. I think the book and Pollyanna are monotonous. Playing that glad game is so stupid. You should not be happy with everything in life. The language is also very boring and dull. I put the book down after the fifth chapter.
1,Worn Out Words,"Pollyanna is a digraceful novel. There are many misspelled and worn out words.In 1907 women did not have the right to do anything they want. So they looked up to Pollyanna and her joyfulness. Now, women have the right to do anything, unlike back then.I would not recomend this realistic fiction book to anyone. It is horrible."
3,mismatch,"I am, like so many people, fascinated by Scholl's voice. His Harmonia Mundi releases had 'this strange effect on me'. On this latest release his voice somehow does not match the music. Or may be the music does not match his voice......."
1,laughable- what an imagination,"I know the lady he calls Anna from Russia in Chapter 20- she definitely is not KGB, her father never won a Gold Medal in the Olympics, she is about 5""11 not 6'3""- though is everybit as gorgeous as the book states- in fact she worked as model and as ""Barbie"" at some toy stores in the Naples area at Christmas.Her parents were very poor from the St Petersburg Russia area when I met her. They were neither KGB nor involved in the airlines business.Her husband at the time - S. Burchill as mentioned in the book, met her online and conned her into believing he was rich successful business man then used her as Trophy wife and babysitter for his three children that he had joint custody of. She divorced him - was not deported and has remarried here in the states.It makes for interesting reading but his fact checking is terrible and one has to believe if he makes up stories about such minor parts of his book- how much of the rest is true?"
1,Break out the tin-foil hats,"A collection of half-truths, myths, and plain bad reporting tied together by random convulsions of thought. One of the stories peddled is the well debunked myth (check snoopes.com) that somehow the bin Laden family was allowed to leave the US right after the attack while all commercial traffic was still grounded. We know at this time that was not the case nor did the president directly authorize the flight.Anyone actually interested in 9-11 would do well to stay away from this conspiracy drivel."
4,Humminbird Mount,workes well on the hummindird gps/ fishfinder it will mount good on the front of the boat or in the back.
4,I love going cordless,"I bought this shop light to replace a 13 watt florescent light I have used for years. The attributes that attracted me was the cordless ability and the positive reviews. I have been using it often for a few weeks and it has done well. It lasts several hours on a charge, the longest I have used it it five hours. The brightness is okay, but is a little more directional than my old light. The magnet is small but okay because the LED light weighs very little. I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't used it very long and the fit and finish is just good. I am really enjoying the cordless ability."
2,"It was the best of Tams, it was the worst of Tams",Selection of songs was splendid. The stereo was ridiculous. Vocal on one channel and most of everything else on the other. Perhaps Ace or even Universal could show this material the respect it deserves. I would wait until the majors begin another round of re-releasing catalog in the congifuration of the week.
3,Semi Accurate but Entertaining,"The book was entertaining and gives an easy overview of the Bible. This was the intention of Robert Darden. However he tended to confuse the facts somewhat. In one case he implied that Noah's ark was a perfect cube. This is actually true in the Gilgemish epic account, but the Bible gives completely different dimentions. Don't take what he says too seriously and you'll do just fine."
4,Windows 7 support and rated for 250w or higher power supplies,"I dropped this in an old 8-year old Dell. I was specifically looking for an nVidia card that would function with the Dell's 250w power supply, AGP 4x slot and have support under Windows 7. This card worked (nearly) perfectly.My only complaint is that the slots in the Dell are pretty close together, and there is a connector hanging off this card for the VGA port. I don't need dual-head support, so I unplugged the connector, and used the provided DVI-to-VGA adapter to drive the VGA monitor off the DVI port. Minor inconvenience, but overall it satisfied all my requirements so I'm happy with it."
3,Uumm..,"This album isn't bad, but it aint great either. Things went down hill after Justin left, don't get me wrong Matty can sing (saw them live with Reel Big Fish - very good show!) but their sound has changed way too much since the Waste of Mind days. If you liked MFZB then you'll might enjoy Broadcast, if not then you definetely won't."
5,my favorite old book,This was my very favorite book as a young girl/teenager and I still have the old copy that I've read over and over.
5,"Please, Please read this series!","I can't believe that I'm the first person to review this book. I hope that people read my review and take the time to read John Mortiomer's excellent series. This is one of the few novels in the long-ruinning Rumpole series, and it's a good one. Most of the time the stories are in short story format, and those are excellent as well. In this book Rumpole has ostensibly retired to live in Florida, but the sun and fun do not interest him. He wants to be back fighting cases at the Old Bailey in England, and when he spies a news story about a murder in good old ""Jolly Old"" he has to go back. Leaving She Who Must be Obeyed behind, he hops a plane and returns. These books are hilariously funny, and as I read I can't help but picture Leo McKern who played such a truly wonderful Horace Rumpole in the BBC series. If you love English humour, and smashing good mysteries please read these books."
2,A plethora of elementary grammatical errors.,"I have never had the unhappy experience of being exposed to such incredibly poor editing. The typos and redundancies were very distracting. Repeatedly re-reading sentences and mentally editing every page interfered with the flow of the narrative. Also, if this fellow is a former Marine, he didn't pick up on the 1949 Marine Corps lingo as all my fellow Marine Corps buddies know it. And, Marine, as in ""he is a U. S. Marine"" is a proper noun not to be confused with ""marine"" as in marine life in the Atlantic ocean. Professional editing might have salvaged Mr. Keane's sincere effort."
5,This is a truly wonderful album,"I'm not big into pop music, but this CD really hit a note with me. I had never heard of Darius until I was searching for a song one day and his songs came up. This is the only album I own by him but I'm happy to have it apart of my collection. Like another user said, if you are lucky enough to have heard this album in the USA then you have experienced a real treat."
5,"BLUES CLUES, DORA, AND OTHERS","GREAT SERVICE, GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT PRICE. MY SON WATCHES OVER AND OVER AND OVER....THANKS FOR COMBINING ALL THESE SHOW ON ONE DISC"
5,Great music and deal,Music is definately great. The purchase was quick in every way and as advertised.
4,We Liked It...,"Some may not, but we liked it! This CD has a nice mix of hit songs. One thing, we wish it had a few more tracks on the CD. If you want only one Seal CD; this is it! We love it!"
4,Bike Helmet,This was a Christmas gift for our son who had picked it out. He likes it although he hasn't had a chance to use it much yet.
1,Believe the bad reviews,"Yes, this is a bad product. I used new batteries, charged it well and it worked for about 2 minutes and then it stopped working. After recharging it there was no improvement. Waste of $12. Great idea, poor execution!"
2,Good concept as long as it works.,"Bought it for my 2 cats. One of them really really loved it. But to his disappointment, after I had to charge it for the second time, it stopped working. My cat wanted to play with it again but it no longer moves although it's charged. I will be returning the item to meijer where I bought it. And just FYI, I paid half price of what the price is here on amazon....not on sale."
4,Bach can do no wrong!!,Love it. I'm a total fan of JS Bach and could never say anything negative about any of his creations. This CD as well!
4,Great Story! Respectable Storytelling.,"What a story! A classic tale of corruption in Washington, DC. I was both entertained and educated by the author's summary of this complicated series of events. He introduces the characters, the situation, and describes the ""action"" in a respectable narrative style.Sometimes I pay almost no attention to the Federal Government. The unveiling of Abramoff, DeLay, Ralph Reed, and the other villains is this drama passed me by. This book has filled me in admirably. Stone's choice of level of detail seemed just right.I take off one star for the few places where one wishes the editor had made the author clean up unnecessary repetition, and for the general lack of color. The style is that of a journalist, not a novelist.A fine job of reducing a complicated story to a brisk, informative read."
3,interesting historically,"a decent read. puts the reader on the inside of a period in political history. the next book he wrote, ""the right fights back"" was too difficult to ready...too full of himself."
2,This is what I get for not checking reviews,I would've gone with regular ceiling light bulbs and been better off. These still emit that yellow tinge of light which makes the room look dull and lifeless.Not recommended for lamps or ceiling lights. I'll buy cheaper bulbs next time.
3,"It's made for barbershops, not the home.","It's designed more for barbershops than for home use. It needs a special liquid soap along with distilled water. The soap tends to settle at the bottom and has to be mixed up or else it clogs up the works.It's great for barbershops or anyplace where you're going to use it all day long (I have 6 in my barbershop--can't do my job without them). For anyone else who wants a hot lather once a day, I'd recommend mixing up lather with a brush and shaving soap (Arko is good) in a scuttle."
3,"Not bad, but needs re-mixing","The lineup is stellar, including late, great drummer Cozy Powell and UFO guitarist/keyboardist Paul Raymond. Plus, it's Schenker live -- how bad can it be? Still, this is an album in desperate need of remixing. Powell is way out in front and that throws the entire effort off. Sound-wise, a better buy is last year's Unforgiven World Tour."
5,Mellow but Great!,Keith has a amazing voice and his lyrics really touch people's hearts. Its very different from Life of Agony but I like it. The guitars sound great and quality riffs. It ranges from rock to jazz to blues to contempary. Any new keith fans check out LIFE OF AGONY for more of keith's great singing.
4,Excellent voice!,"This guy can sing. I enjoyed all the songs of his that have been on the radio but the ones that weren't were kind of boring. The DVD that came with this package isn't worth the extra bucks plus they didn't include the ""Kiss From a Rose"" video."
1,absolute rubbish,"For the money I expected a movie, not this rubbish!!! Better luck next time Regards."
1,Filth and Bad Taste,"John Wayne once described the contemporary American appetite for sex and violence in films as ""filth and bad taste."" If that's what you're looking for, this film delivers."
1,Absolute Garbage,"I am pretty ashamed to say that i watched this movie in the theater and the only reason i watched it is because i watched the first and felt a need to know how it all ended. Speaking of the end..the ending in this one is pretty dumb. One of the stupidest things i ever seen. The villian ""Bill"" is killed by being poked to death with a finger..anyway thinking about the movie turns me off, if you really want to watch it rent it but DO NOT BUY."
3,tarantinos back,this was not as good as volume 1 THERE WES NO ACTION AT ALL besieds when she kills the 1 ied patch girll it was preaty sespensfull you should rent it before you bie this film
3,that's a GREAT sandwich,"I like the part when ""Bill"" - David Carradine - is making that sandwich. I mean, he is REALLY into making that sandwich - the sandwich bread, the mayonaise, everything all perfectly laid out. I swear, I have never seen anyone spread mayonaise with such precision in my life - all while holding an intimate conversation about life and death. It was such effortless, graceful sandwich making - they practically made themselves!I can tell you, I was ready to eat that sandwich when it was all done, but sadly, he made one for himself and his kid, and I never got any.I never understood why it took Mia Farrow 45 minutes to an hour to kill each of Bill's underlings. But then she killed Bill himself in like 5 seconds, all while never getting out of her patio seat. Lamest ending ever."
5,A Great Conclusion To A Great Story,"Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a great film. Tarantion dazzled us with action and gore in the first one, and he dazzles us with conversations and intense moments in this one. David Carradine gives the best performance of his career, and captivates the audience as Bill. Uma Thurman is a wonder once again as the bride, and she does even better as the film gets more emotional. the fight scenes are less prevalent, but just just as effective and Tarantino lets all his actors shine with this great script. Michael Madsen is wonderful in this film, and he probably should only work for Tarantino the rest of his career. A brilliantly directed and acted film that rises to the occasion."
4,Interesting...but Kill Bill Vol 1 was better,"I loved Kill Bill Vol 1 and was anxious to see how Vol 2 ended the story of the bride. Although Vol 1 was a bit ultraviolent, what really set it apart was the original characters. Vol 2 has some interesting plot twists, but it does not captivate like Vol 1.Be sure to catch Robert Rodriguez, director of the El Mariachi Trilogy (El Mariachi, Desperado, Once Upon A Time In Mexico), and his bend ""Chingon"" in the special features. They contributed much of the soundtrack to Kill Bill. There's a live two song set of the band performing songs combining ""Chingon-ized"" versions of traditional Mexican mariachi songs. Great stuff. You can buy the CD on Amazon too (search for B00016XNAW)."
4,Keeps getting better.,"I have seen this movie and handful of times, and I'm still a huge fan. Tarantino really keeps you locked-in with this conclusion to Volume 1. The dialogue, the musical arrangements... they are all phenomenal!"
4,If Vol. 1 was good Vol. 2 is double good,I ordered Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2 at the same time. You just can't get the whole breathless story unless you watch them together. I love the action and intensity of the movies and I think the cast is superb. Uma Thurman was amazing and I found it hard to take my eyes off her. I recommend these movies to any action junkie.
4,bride gonna kick,"Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 1 was slick, gory, and cinematographically fantastic, with character development and plot partially being sacrificed for the violence and action. Vol.1 was a fast-paced tribute to pop culture of both east and west - and for that reason, many people criticise vol. 2 because its basically the opposite. But you have to remember that its not so much a sequel as the second half of a film. Vol.2 does not have the blood-spraying violence and in-your-face tenacity that gives the first film its bite, but it does have richer character development and also an emotional maturiy that was not as apparent in the first volume.Vol. 2 should not disappoint, though - the coffin scene, the opening flashback in black/white, and especially the 'cruel tutelage of pai mei' (in my opinion the movie's best scene).For those expecting vol.1's ferocity with perhaps even more, you'll be disappointed, but it doesn't stop Kill Vill Vol. 2 from being one mad film."
3,Gladly,"take this movie and throw it into the trash. It is a repetitive movie that plays of the first part of Kill Bill. Although acting and directing is still good, it doesn't make up for the boredom of the movie. NO good fighting scenes and jumping back and forth through time makes this movie choppy at best."
5,some memorable scenes,"I think that the scene where Bill finishes conversation with The Bride and they start to fight is one of the best examples of great cinema. Also. There was a western on TV just before Bill quickly pulled out the gun. Seemed to me like a warning...Wish there were more scenes with the kung-fu master and frankly with all other characters. That would probably make it 10 hours long. The movie has so much in it, it seems like some kind of ""best of"" episode of (good) TV series. Usually movies today would take a tenth what Kill Bill has and stretch it to 2 hours.It's hard not to think about Sergio Leone (and Ennio Marricone) while watching Kill Bill, but it only makes you think that there isn't enough movies made this way.The constant change of style is distracting, but in a good way. It also makes the movie more of a tribute or a show.Kill Bill directed by: ""Sergio Leone+Coen Brothers"""
3,Good but not great.,"Kill Bill Volume 2 wasn't a great movie but it was a good movie. Not as exciting and fun to watch as volume one. Although I enjoyed most parts of volume 2, it lack the action and fun to watch mentality that volume one had atleast until the fight scenes happen which there wasn't too much off in Volume 2. This movie spent entirely too much time talking and not enough action. I still plan to buy the DVD sequel when it is released, I still like Kill Bill Vol.2, but I love Vol. 1 and for these reasons I gave Kill Bill Vol.2 three stars because I like the movie but I do not love it."
3,Tried It Once,"This rosin is not as soft as I had heard. It's not bad, but after trying it for a while, I decided to mix it with some others in order to give it a little better consistency. That's a lot of work for most bassists. I've had better luck with Jade rosin (for solo work) and Carlsson rosin (otherwise), both of which are sold by Amazon, as well."
1,Did not buy,"Was trying to decide on whether or not to purchase this item or a piece of plywood. Based on all the reviews, we plan to simply purchase plywood. Thanks everyone for your reviews, you have saved us time and $$$."
3,Anthology,while the the early material is good san francisco psycedelia the music from edward the mad shirt grinder on is all fairly average
4,"Sunnyland Slim - Sad And Lonesome (Jewel, 1972)","Sunnyland Slim belongs to those generation and category of Bluesmen who, although their bar was placed high enough, never permitted themselves not clearing it.This set, titled Sad And Lonesome originally issued on Jewel label in 1972, demonstrates usual high class piano playing by the master but more accent is made on Sunnyland Slim's singing - powerful, deep down, and overwhelming. Already an acclaimed Blues piano player by the time of recording this set, Mr. Slim focuses on band work getting helping hand and inducing soloing and leading by Big Walter Horton on harmonica and Eddie Shaw on saxophone.Great set.pastblues.com"
5,The Darkest RED!,THIS ALBUM RULES! The Agony Scene Return w/a much powerful sound and a sense of presense is felt when you hear all the drums poundings on this cd! Plus the vocals are pretty freakin sweet!! I personally can't decide which is my fav b/c I simply like all the songs period. This album is good for any fan of roadrunner records and definately any fan of metal/metalcore maybe? This album is really cool! Check it out they only keep getting better!!
5,excellent buy.,The product came quickly; was easy to program and is working quite well. Very satisfied with both the service and the product itself.
4,Fuji Z5fd Camera,"This is a great camera for the value. Everyone who sees it thinks it is great. Everything works as expected. With a 2 Gig memory card this could last for a full week's vacation. I bought it so I could always have a camera ready on a trip. It takes great people pictures and scenery is also well balanced. It won't be a great nature photography camera if you like crisp photos that can be obtained with a 6 meg Nikon digital SLR camera. But that's not what you are buying this baby for, is it?"
5,photos or videos with size of ipod,"After over a year of use, I feel it is more than safe to say WOW! Fantastic videos & many high quality photos. Many were taken on horseback during long distance competion in high winds, blowing snow, blowing rain, frozen & even nice weather."
3,Grainy indoor pictures,"This camera takes great outdoor pictures, but indoor pictures esp at lower light and close ups are quite grainy. I bought a Nikon Coolpix P80, a little more expensive and larger to carry, but the picture quality is much better. Still looking for a great pocket sized camera."
5,"So real, poignant, touching","Hard life, strong people. This is wonderfully written non-fiction that reads like a novel. You want to be there, to lend a helping hand, or at least a shoulder to cry on, and in the end you'll feel like you know the Filaree ranch and Marguerite's family history as your own."
4,"Fascinating and repulsive, all at the same time----","The thought of this movie has stayed with me since I first saw it in the early l980's. In fact, I have shared its content with many friends who never saw it. What struck me the most is how the handsome cavalry officer, once so repulsed by this hideous, obnoxious woman, came to not only see her as beautiful, but became obsessed with her. Why do you suppose that is? Well, it is my belief that it is hard to resist those who find us irrestible---this is a very unusual movie and not for everyone---I like foreign films such as this one; how many actresses in America would allow themselves to take on the emaciated repulsive look this actress did? can't think of any"
2,Passion d'amore,"An old K7. The sound and the images are well past their sell date...!However, the film is a masterpiece!"
5,A must for the bookshelf,"This is a wonderful book. Excellent story, excellent character development, history made real for the reader. Lots of action. Read the book and then pass it on."
1,Useless,"A linksys tech ask me to delete it and said ""you do not need that"" so, I deleted it but I had already paid for it."
2,Doesn't play nice with Vista,"If you've got a wired all XP professional network, then it works fine, however don't add a vista laptop with a wireless connection to the mix it is just one big headache. Went back & forth with tech support and when I finally gave up and said that when I didn't use NM to manage the connection, everything went fine...their response was Great glad that things are working for you."
2,read the fine print,The programs works most of the time and is not hard to install. The one thing you need to note is if you check network magics web site. It tell you that is is for 8 users when you get it it tell you for 3 only. and to be fair if you check the fine print on the picture it DOES say 3 users. I just missed it
5,Great Read!,"This is a wonderfully written time travel love story. The characters are well developed and the storyline is belivable. It is obvious that the author did research on the 1860 and 1985 time periods used in the story. The writing painted a clear picture for me of what life was like in 1860. While I don't think 1985 Georgia was as color blind as Willow, the heroine, was led to believe, it was a sharp contract to her life in 1860. This story clearly shows how love transcends time and race. This is an author to watch."
4,"Great collection, but...","I agree with earlier reviewers about how great these are, but there are some problems.First, it doesn't include the sixth volume in the series, ""Alternate Realities"". With only six volumes ever made, a set that includes five is needlessly incomplete.Second, I paid less for all six volumes individually at Walmart when they first came out than Amazon is charging for this set, so I can't see it as much of a bargain.Third, too much duplication. Yes, there are some episodes that fit into more than one of these categories. That doesn't mean they had to be included in each of them, at the expense of other episodes.Fourth, a few of the episode selections. Darmok? Really?? DARMOK?!?! Could they have found a more flawed episode?Still, though, flaws aside, this is a set that highlights what made the franchise so great, so I still give it four stars."
4,Stek Trek Collection,I bought this for my husand's birthday. I would have giving it a 5 star rating except I am not enjoying watching one Trek episode after another. Before purchasing remember this is almost 2400 minutes of Star Trek.The shipping was on time and the product was as advertised. I would say if you like Star Trek or know someone who is this is a great purchase.
1,Avoid - terrible phone system,"We bought this to replace an AT&T; cordless system that suddenly died after eighteen months of light to moderate use. I was dubious about buying this phone, but my wife wanted one we could wall-mount in the kitchen.The bottom line: This is a terrible product. The LCD panel on the base unit is hard to read at best, but when wall-mounted the display is barely readable unless you stoop to view it from below. The brightness of the readout varies from day to day, oddly; sometimes it isn't readable at all.We might have been able to live with that (inertia is a powerful thing), but the reception on the two wireless phones is awful - conversations are interrupted by intermittent bursts of static even when standing ten feet from the base station.There are far better phone systems out there for the same money. Avoid."
2,Digital Phone didn't meet standards!,This product did not meet very good standards. Fast shipping BUT the Ditigal displays on the two portable phones was not visible. One portable hand set phone had partial number reading the other portable hand set phone had no digital reading. In order to see who was calling you had to run to the base set. I contacted the seller but did not respond. I think these phones were new but they are a defective product.
5,The Greatest Flash Story Ever!,"This is has got to be the best Flash story ever written!!! Geoff Johns knew what he was doing when he wrote this storyline. Under his guidance, ""Blitz"" would become one of the most important and historical storyline's ever for the Flash and is praised by many comic fans still to this day. And even if your new to the Flash and his history, then this is also the book for you since you basically get the history of Wally West (the current Flash), his wife Linda Park, Jay Garrick (the first Flash), and most of the Rogues to. We're also for the first time introduced to the Flash's arch-enemy and the most deadliest rogue of all: Zoom (literally ""the Reserve Flash"".) And there's even a guest appearance by two older character's all the fans will love.Overall, if you are a Flash fan then is a MUST HAVE! Buy it as soon as you can! I recommend it more then even ""The Flash Archives."""
2,Not what I expected,"When I saw the title of this book, I expected it to be a ""Chicken Soup for the ___ Soul"" type book. I expected to read a bunch of short stories of the heartwarming (and possibly a little sickeningly sweet) variety, told from the pagan point of view. However, the book had a bit of a ""soapbox"" feel to me. It was full of articles, how-to rituals,(which are fine in their own right, but I wanted stories) and just an offhand mention of stories. I felt a little cheated, because I wanted a light hearted and fluffy, feel good book and got what felt a bit like a homework assignment."
4,Strong Symbolism,Melville tells the story of Ahab's search for the whale and at the same time shows us how we are seeking to know our creator. The chapter descibing whiteness of the whale contrasted with our darkness alone is worth the purchase.
5,Still a home run,"The characters breathe on the page and the writer's storytelling is inimitable. This is a whale of a tale, a literary event that you will talk about for years or even decades.Roger Weston, author ofThe Golden Catch"
5,"Poorly distributed in the US, Great recording","Quick capsule review: This recording was never available on vinyl, except as an import. Coming after the transitional Now we are six record, Commoner's Crown offered a mature and focused Steeleye Span. If your favorite Steeleye Span period is the Below the Salt, Parcel of Rogues and All around my Hat period--get this CD. You will not be disapointed"
3,Too much joking,"I agree with other reviewers that the subject of this book is fascinating and that there is plenty of information about it here. If you are not a professional linguist and are interested in an overview of the field, by all means go on and buy a copy.But if you are really studying languages, chances are that you will be disappointed: McWhorter seems skeptical about his readership's interest in his topic, and in an attempt to keep their attention he finds himself constantly digressing -- by means of jokes and cultural analogies that add nothing to his coverage of what really matters."
2,There's Babel in the Power of Babel,"Thought this would be an interesting read but barely got past the introduction before consigning it to the recycle bin.First of all, the author's comments on evolution and mutations have been overtaken by important new discoveries. There's much more involved than just mutations. Second, the author states several times as fact that there once existed a single language possessed by the humans who migrated out of Africa to populate the world. I don't question the migration but the idea that there once existed a single spoken language used by all living humans is absurd. This idea implies, and the author directly implies this idea since he states it several times, that a single mutation brought the human power of speech into existence. Although I'm not going to attempt to provide any proofs here, the development of human language must have been a progressive process taking unknown hundreds of thousands of years to reach its full powers as we know of it today."
2,"The good, the bad, and the boring...","This book is a mix of interesting ""did you know"" facts, mind-numbing forays into pidgin and creole languages, and evolutionist rubbish, with a LOT of private ""wink-nudge"" notes and 20th-century pop culture references thrown in. I love learning about language and languages, but I wish I hadn't wasted my time on this particular book."
2,Big omission,"Professor Whorter completly skipped over the most fundamental information in relation to the start and migration of Indo-European languages from the Armenian Plateau. He did not mention the research by Professors Atkinson and Gray, published in Nature Magazine in 2003, of the Indo-European language having its roots in Tocharian and Armenian, which dates back at least 9000 years. Professor Ivanov's 25 year research of the Indo-European langauge, which confirmed the Atkinson's and Gray's comperative linguist analysis, was also missed. An omission at this magnitute places a faulty foundation on proceeding arguments including the omission of the Armenian language roots of almost all Indo-European languages including Greek and German. Robert Ellis, in his book, Armenian Origins of the Etruscans, had more to say 105 years ago on this topic than professor Whorter."
