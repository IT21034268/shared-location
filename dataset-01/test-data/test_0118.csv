1,"weak, where's the old doug?","I got this thinking it was the old classic doug from nick unfortunatly it isn't, it is some new doug from abc people might like this but I think it is necassary to warn others"
3,A fine enough CD,"Frankly, I was pleasantly surprised with this latest CD, given that I thought Somerville's last one was a big disappointment. ""Manage..."" includes several tracks that continue his love/talent for the disco/dance anthem (""Something to Live For"" or ""Stone"", for example) and the bellowing of the first track (""Here I Am"") is reminiscent of the best of Bronski Beat. However, what I found best were those tracks where Somerville updates his sound by successfully delving into more recent styles (dabbling in trip-hop and techno) such as on the recriminating ""Dark Sky"" or especially on the melodiously catchy ""This Must Be Love"" (great single!). Other favorites are ""Someday Soon"" and ""Rolling"". Not all of these tracks worked for me. A few, upon listening for a few months, I found needed skipping over (""Lay Down"" and ""Eve""). But, for the most part, this is a welcome addition to Somerville's talented career."
4,"Great Books, a Great Author !","Hi, I just started to read Mr. Sandford's Prey Series for the last 2 weeks, so far I have read 2 (Silent Prey and Winter Prey -- thanks to our City Library here) and I'm reading Sudden Prey. I cannot stop reading this book. Now I saw a new book of his (Certain Prey) and I am so excited to get it! I have to start from the beginning so I will have a set of these series. Mr. Sandford, you are now one of my favorite authors. Please continue and more power to you! You're the best...!"
4,"""The Crooked E""","An interesting look inside Enron from a ""regular"" employee's perspective. Plus, Cruver has a good sense of humor. ""Conspiracy of Fools"" is a much more detailed account of Enron's criminal activities, but as you read it you keep thinking, ""Were they really so obnoxious that they though they would get away with that?"" Cruver has you laughing as you realize they really were!"
5,Wonderful Slow Dance DVD,This is a wonderful dvd to learn some beautiful moves for slow dancing and is very well taught. My wife and I are very pleased with this purchase and recommend it to others.
4,classic poems children will enjoy,"In 1965 my young daughter bought this book for her father. Every night each of our four children would select a poem to read to him and me. Soon they had some of their favorites memorized. It is a selection of some of the greatest poems ever written. I recently purchased copies for my children, their children and their children's children. I still read one to myself every morning with my first cup of coffee and it brings back such wonderful memories and keeps my memory strong."
5,"An girl's adventure story, but not just for girls","It definitely reads as a middle-grade or young-adult book, but there's an amazing amount of political/royal intrigue. Mainly, it's a great adventure story, with danger and mystery, and a strong female lead. I don't even like adventure novels, or intrigue, either, but the characters were so well-drawn that it pulled me in. The setting, early medieval Scotland, was thoroughly unfamiliar to me and probably to most readers, so it feels more like a fantasy novel, with a lot of world-building needed, which seemed to come about naturally and without the usual exposition that pulls me out of fantasy books. There's a bit of Celtic magic, but not too much, and pagan and Christian theology seem to live side-by-side with no strife. When I later read Mary Stewart's ""The Hollow Hills,"" I was reminded of this book and this world."
1,"This isn't the ""current"" version!","This is a scholar's reprint of an old version of the book - don't take this to a regular Sacred Harp singing! It's not compatible! It's a fine book for its purpose. But some of the other reviewers have failed to mention this!And I don't know how they think they can charge that much, either. I bought this version NEW for $20.00."
2,I gave it away,"There is really no reason to own this album. You are far better off just getting the LP's. If you were only going to buy one clash album I would get their debut ""The Clash"" album either the UK or US version, it matters not. I don't care for the recordings on this either, they sound different to me then the originals. Maybe these album was made to represent the Clash, I feel it does just the opposite. I think it might mislead a new fan into thinking this is the best the Clash has to offer, which is far, far from the truth."
4,Great single disc collection.,"It's obvious that to really know the Clash, is to get all their albums. But since you here, you're probably looking for a good package of hits. This is a great remastered single disc collection spanning their entire career. Based on what's here, I gave it 4 stars. If you're missing some songs, you may be interested in the older two disc collection, ""Story of the Clash"". That has 10 more songs than this does. If that's still missing your favorite songs, you may want the newer two disc, ""The Essential Clash"". That has another 12 songs, and 22 more than the singles collection, all remastered. The most for your money by far. Of course if it still doesn't have what you want, then you've come full-circle, and must get all their albums. There's a reason why The Clash are in the R&R Hall of Fame. RIP Joe Strummer."
5,Just What I Wanted,The DVDs are great and are working correctly. There are no scratches or anything. It came fast and was exactly what I ordered.
5,Still very good,"No one has more experience with Aussies than Jean Hartnagle, and her book is still unsurpassed as the authoritative work on the breed. You would have to buy 3 other books to get all the info in this one."
5,The most comprehensive source book for Sensation Seeking.,I am a PsyD student and writting my dissertation on this topic and so far have not found any other source more comprehensive than this one. It covers all aspects of the topic without any biases.
2,Keep looking ...,"While this book does provide an overview of many morphological theories, it was also enough to make a class full of linguistics graduate students wish they had not decided to study morphology. The book was rather unorganized and difficult to read. I don't know if there are better books out there on the topic, but I would recommend looking further."
2,entertaining but misses the mark,"This book attempts to illustrate the associations of empires and does so in an articulate and entertaining fashion. With respect to the current empire's follies, the author fails to give the true reasoning. It fails to understand the real purpose of the federal reserve system, and that all wars since then have served to enrich those who profit from war while enslaving the working class in paying for it and fighting with their blood. All these follies which have led to the current massive federal debt have been intentional, this is not the result of clouded imperialistic ego. Readers need to skip this book if they really want to know what is going on in the monetary system."
1,Sensationalized Doom and Gloom,"While the subject of growing debt should never be taken lightly, Bonner & Wiggin are guilty of exaggeration and emotionalization. Some basic figures (internet sources):Total household debt: $11 TrillionTotal govt. debt: $6.4 TrillionSo, total debt liability for US taxpayers: $17.4 Trillion; $59K per capitaSounds bad... but,Average income per capita: $32K paAverage per capita net worth: $165KSo the ratios are:Debt to Asset: 36%Times Interest Earned: 7.8Nothing to be overly alarmed about.There are many other arguments against Bonner & Wiggin's thesis, in support of the view that the US economy is generally sound, and still very much stronger than all other economies, and that there is no threat of imminent implosion. Do your homework and don't buy into the perma-bear hype just because of their scaremongering - it sells books."
4,It's About Time!,"You better believe that the day of reckoning is here. And don't we deserve it? I haven't felt so fired up and filled with foreboding since I watched ""USA The Movie"" (and that turned out to be right on too!)Our entire standard of living is based on credit and our willingness to spend, spend, spend until we're broke or until we slide into a decline and whine our heads off about those other countries that are trying to ""muscle in on our territory, boo-hoo"".This is a great book. Funny, timely and sharp. It rips us and rightly so. The best thing you can do for yourself if you want a real wake-up call is to read this truth telling tale and max another credit card. Why not fiddle while Rome burns?"
1,"Bill Bonner king of ""doom & gloom""",His solution is to buy gold/silver & digyourself a hole in a ground to live in.
5,Required reading for americans,"Well written book. Many americans are not aware of this stuff. The view is British in my opinion and while correct doesn't necessarily predict the future. It seems to be taken from the audios ""Wizards of money"" by Smithy."
3,Hunter Thompson meets Ayn Rand.,"Do you believe that World War II was the worst thing that ever happened to the USA? Then this book is for you!For the rest of us, it is an amusing insight into the mind of the lunatic fringe, gold bug division. Bonner can certainly write, he's very entertaining. Gonzo financial journalism."
2,"Extended version ""NOT"" ncluded.","I thought by purchasing this Cd, with several versions of Thinking About Your Love, would also include the extended version. It did not. There was no information on the time length of these tracks before I purchased it. I am disappointed that the manufacture could include several versions of this song, but not the original 8 minutes plus seconds. I don't why some manufactures do that."
4,Great spring,"Wow, this is one great spring. I can't imagine there is another spring on the market that will work as well as this one does on this particular tool."
4,Dog Costume.,"We haven't used the costume yet because Halloween isn't here, but in a trial run it fit vey well. I will have to do a couple of alterations on the hat so it will fit a little better but other than that a very cute costume."
3,Fair enough.,"The plot concerns a woman who is tied to her bed by her huband and then her husband dies leaving her to get out of the handcuffs alone. It's not much plot, but at the end I would say it kind of picks up."
3,Should have been a novella,"Gerald's Game is an interesting premise. A young woman named Jessie is handcuffed to her bed to partake in kinky love when her husband Gerald suffers from a heart attack and dies. We are left with Jessie trying to escape the handcuffs while struggling to survive through basic means like needing to eat and drink, and also have her sanity survive.Gerald's Game is a book that I quickly tried to read, if only because I didn't want to lag through it. I was surprised at the book seemed to have finished earlier then I thought but the aftermath is about 40 pages. King should have cut the last 40 pages and just put it in one of his short story collections. Its not really a bad thing, but if your like me and you need to read anything done by King then you will probably read this just to be a completest."
3,Gerald's Game is a riveting READ!,Stephen King unravels the salacious tale of a lawyer's wife handcuffed to her bed as part of a kinky sex game devised by her pudgy and repulsive husband. Gerald is a pudgy lawyer while wife Jessie is a retired school teacher.What happens in their remote Maine lakeside cabin will send chills down your spine and keep you up all night!The ending is weak but the detailed descriptions of Jessie'splight is well done.King has done a fine job of writing one of his most engrossing novels. Good reading although some readers will be turned off by the explicit sexual dialogue. Not for the faint of heart!
2,book kind of trashed,"I got this book today and it wasn't the one in the picture instead it was like a twenty year old copy and very beat up, not to happy but for four dollars is readable even with the yellow pages. Betterworld books seems to have better quality."
4,Trapped!,"This is one of those stories that makes you think. Think what?WHO IN THE WORLD THOUGHT HANDCUFFS WERE KINKY!!!! This is probablygoing through Gerlad's wife's mind as she lays helplessly handcuffedto their bed. A bed that happens to be in the middle of no where atthis moment.We watch on in horror as her mental state is tested. Tested byhunger and thirst, by fear (both real and imagined). Listeningto this story on a trip back from Florida left me spooked!Moral of the story: Never, not ever, do you piss of the guyhold the handcuff keys!"
3,Gerald's Game was not one of King's best.,"I read Gerald's Game and actually did like it. However I think that the plot line was a little thin, the story moved along too slowly and, it just wasn't up to par with IT and The Shining (not that anything could be)."
4,"King doesn't write only ""physical"" horror....","With this book, King shows us that he also knows how to write excellent ""mental horror"" stories. Not just monsters' stories. Showing us just how a person can feel when being trapped and not being able to do anything. It's also incredible how he can write a whole book about two days and one night on the life of a woman. At first I tought this book would be boring, but it's incredible how it isn't. This is not the traditional King's style, but I tell you: try this one and nobody will regret."
3,"TRASHY JUNK, BUT OH SO INTERESTING.","THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR THE EASILY OFFENEDED. IT STARTS OFF WITH WILD SEX, BUT DOESN'T REALLY MOVE ON MUCH FROM IT'S START. GOOD FOR HORNY POKES THOUGH"
2,Seems to borrow from other novels.,Is King recycling himself?? This novel was written like a compilation of some of his other novels. Although the realistic issues of abuse were interesting. The story didn't seem to have focus. it did seem to have elements of other stories King has written.1. Confinment to a bed? (Misery)2. rapid Dog attack ? (Cujo)And What about the links to Deloris Claiborne? Was the movie based on this book? or Was this book a complete copy of that book? I'm confused?Plus I didn't understand at all His need to throw a little supernatural component in the story's end.
1,"Worst Steven King book, avoid!","I am actually a fan of Steven King, but for a time he just really seemed to run out of good ideas and was trying to get a bit too clever. This travesty is the result. He tries to do a ""stream of consciousness"" type of book, trying to take us into this woman's mind, and what she is thinking about and it just doesn't work, it's terribly boring and annoying. This is one of the few books I really had to strain to finish, as it was so unpleasant to read. Not sure why I did bother to finish it, other than just determination to not leave a book unread, but the ending certainly didn't leave me feeling any more satisfied than the rest of the book."
1,King's Game and he lost,I have this in hardcover as I read it when it was first released. I pulled it off of my bookshelf as I was simply in need of something to read and then it all came back to me as to how much I hated this book. Women ends up in a situation where she is trapped and then the rest of the book is nothing but pure rubbish as she has flashbacks of her life. Hmm...does Cujo come to mind here? Bottom line.....BORING!
3,What a book,All I can is that this book is so so.I gave it 3 stars for good story but it really could have been better.
1,"Thanks ""Publishers Weekly""",Thanks so much Publishers Weekly for your review at the top of the page!You gave away the ending - she escapes from the handcuffs. Well done!I was going to buy the book but thanks to you now I don't have to do I?
3,Would have been better as a short story,"The premise behind the novel reminds me a bit of CUJO, since all of the events leading up to the dilemma are wound tightly and believably together, but, unfortunately, the final work isn't pulled off quite as well. Overall, the book seems too long and drawn out, but at the same time, if I wanted to play editor, I wouldn't know what to take out. In true King style, all of the information is necessary to the overall pull of the novel, but the feel is that it just goes on and on. I can't help but think that if the book had been drawn down to the bare bones (pun intended for those who've already read the book), it would have been as taut and dramatic as ""Survivor Type""."
2,King sold out.,"First, let me say I am an avid Stephen King reader. I have read everything he has written. I was disappointed with this book. But, I was disappointed for different reasons than have been mentioned. I was disappointed with the ending. It is a very NON-KING ending. I don't want to spoil it, but I feel King was thinking about movie rights when he wrote the ending. What happened to supernatural, unexplainable events? When King's books are turned into movies, the endings are usually changed. Happy endings with ends that are tied together are what Hollywood wants. Stephen King tends to go in to opposite direction in his books. But not with Gerald's Game."
1,Wretched,"How can I describe my utter dissappoinment frustration and ultimate boredom to this travesty. There is just not enough material here to justify a mammoth novel. If you are into character studies you probably would like this. However if you are looking for a plot, entertainment, horror, suspense or anything vaguely Kingish look elsewhere. The pits."
2,Shallow and monotonous,"The end product is at least twice the length of its true content. The novel couldn't decide if it wanted to be a suspense thriller or a shallow character study. It failed at both--as a suspense thriller, it's neither suspenseful or thrilling for most of the pages; as a character study, the whole manages to be less than the sum of its parts. The protagonist Jesse Burlingame is painted in broad strokes as a self-absorbed yuppie stay-at-home wife; almost 500 pages of stream-of-consciousness ramblings is a painfully long time to be inside her head, and I didn't feel I deeply knew her any better after the 450th page than the 150th.Gerald's Game fails where King has succeeded so well in other books--as other reviewers have noted, it's hard to believe that the wordsmith of such breath-taking character portraits as Jack Torrance from The Shining could fail so spectacularly here."
1,This Book SUCKED!,"This book was definitly the most awful, dull book I've ever read. I got though the first few pages where she getts handcuffed to bed etc etc, and the dog comes in but then I had to put it down. I don't know how Stephen King manages to strangle all of the life out of a potentally good story, but he accomplishes that well with this book. Is it all words and no action with you Stephen? How could the author of It, and The Stand drop this low?"
3,I assume it is good.,"Well, first of all! I did not buy the book for me. I bought it for my friend grand-daughter! And I am sure she loves it!Thank you,Ms. N. Sattaur"
1,poor quality,"it looks great, it feels great, but wait - after a few bottles of wine opened the handles stayed in the down position. Back to my old trusty..."
4,Simply amazing!,"I got to know mr. Petrucciani just few months ago and started finding available material from him, I heard about the Manhattan project ant immediately wanted to get it. It is an amazing piece of art. If you get the chance to buy it, don't hesitate!"
1,Disappointed,"Advertised to work in PS2/DVD/CD rom. Did not work, would not spin. Waste of money and I am extremely disappointed."
1,"Not effective, Cheaply Made","Tried this in vain after trying many other cleaners to try to save a DVD player that has begun skipping on every disc- brand new and used alike. I figured I would try this one since it was the only one I found that had the ""wet"" cleaner option with it. The brush on the disc consists of a flimsy red piece of cloth- unlike other more reputable cleaner discs which have several, sturdier brushes. Did absolutely nothing to help the problem. You get what you pay for."
2,Product needs better description..!,"Bought this lens cleaner for my DVD Player, but as I found out after receiving it, it's for CD/DVD-ROM computer drives, as well as game units. Won't work on a DVD player. Need computer operating system to make it work.More stars if was more accurately described. Can't comment as to the actual product effectiveness."
4,toward the oceanic,"after listening to the dharma, inspired by jack kerouac's late writings, i had a look at my copy of adams' on the transmigration of souls for the compositional dates, the two pieces having much in common as to stand as companion pieces. which is to say there is a deepening of a style at play in adams' work.the second recording, my father knew charles ives, owes much to ives, particularly the musical tension, adams, like ives, never lets the listener forget that marching band music on celebrated holidays is in memory of men and women who fought in wars.the oceanic feeling, something vast and awesome and grand, feelings experienced in response to a tragedy or intense beauty. adams is challenged by some big questions to which he provides musical answers the best that he can.his linear notes on his influences are worth reading, too."
2,Noisy impeller. Gave it 3 months and tossed it.,"A pet store recommended and ordered the 660 for my 29 gallon tank. It was way too much power with no way to adjust the output. My fish were getting blown around the tank. Even worse was the vibration. Even tried rocks on top of the cover to stop the rattling. I pulled it apart to check out the impeller and it appeared fine. Put it back together and it is still noisy. The air valve either spurts bubbles off and on when adjusted full down, or puts out a ton of bubbles when increased. To be fair the other brand's air valves do that also so I end up not using the air tube. I replaced it with an Aquaclear 20. It is so quiet I can't even tell the 20 is running without looking at the surface ripples. Also the Aquaclear output is adjustable. The fish can now catch up to the food and don't feel like they are in a rushing river."
3,A pleasant example of the later Fairport,"The centerpiece of ""Red and Gold"" is the title song, a Ralph McTell ballad based on a British Civil War battle that took place in the band's home base of Cropredy. It's an epic song, and truth be told, it's fairly boring. Luckily, the rest of the album offsets it pretty well. Highlights are Dylan cover ""Open the Door, Richard"" and Maartin Allcock's instrumental ""The Noise Club"". ""Set Me Up"" and ""The Beggar's Song"" also contribute to a lively feel. The CD includes a live version of ""Close to the Wind"" that was not on the original album.(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"
1,Thinly disguised British naval triumphalism,"Arguably the best feature of this volume are the illustrations which, as in the other volumes of this series, are outstanding. The text itself is overly narrowly focused on the Royal Navy and its operations in the Age of Sail, and moreover suffers from the author's apparent pining for the long lost glories of the Empire, not to mention a strong dose of Nelson hero worship."
4,tobyMac Does it again!!!,"WOW... I loved the orginal, and this one is definately a Renovation.. I really Love the Bonus Track - ""Burn For You"" Cat Paw Remix... ""The Slam"" comes out SOOOO fresh.. You gotta get this CD!!!"
3,Cingular 8125 PDA Smartphone USB Twin Cradle Desktop Charger,Shipping was fine - but was disappointed that the USB connection is not a charger - you have to remove the batttery and charge it outside the phone.
2,"Informative, in a way, but......................","Going to keep this very brief. Found some things informative, unfortunately, many people are still daydreamers, and Dedijer is one of them. If somehow he did his research and investigating on a broader scale, you would find that he's figures are very imaginative, and increase by the day.Save your money by NOT buying this book. There are better Science Fiction novels out there.And all this is coming from a Serb myself.Where's the truth these days? Unfortunately, you will not get it from a Serb."
5,Another winner by Noah Gordon,"The story of Michael Kind's journey to find the congregation that would fufill his vision as a Rabbi was both interesting and inspiring. What I found interesting was the way he allowed the character grow into a kind and compasionate person who was willing to give up material wealth in order to become a leader of the type of synagogue he invisioned and the community he wanted to raise his family in.Mr. Godon has written another interesting a meaningful book, he has continued to entertain me and teach me at the same time."
4,A Hard Man,"Life has kicked our hero, but he can kick back. Well plotted tale of revenge and redemption, will keep you hooked. A good read."
4,home kit Sportster,"Good product. sounds good provided you have a window in recommended direction for your area of country and not too many obstructions to sky-under eaves,higher houses etc. If this is a problem I bought a 50' additional cable which is 18 gauge a bit thicker and probably better than origanl 20 foot thin antennae so I could run to a window where it plays well at."
5,very helpful,I used this during my first pregnancy and truly believe it helped me to be relaxed and well prepared for the delivery which ended up being a short labor and 20 minutes pushing. Now I wanted to do the same exercises again in my second pregnancy but couldn't find my book. I just ordered a used version so I don't miss out! I also think the exercises helped me get back in shape quickly after having the baby since my bellymuscles were nicely toned underneath!
1,madagascar will not install properly,"Don't waste your money on the 3 pack, it is not the deal it appears to be.Madagascar will not install. I have XP, so I bought this XP version. I feel robbed and am tempted never to order anything through Amazon again. I don't have the time to go through the send it back routine. If I just buy locally, it is easier to return junk. And that is just what this disc is JUNK.The Shrek is good, Shark Tales is too difficult for the same age group though."
4,EXCELLENT BOOK !!!,"A well thought book with appropriate stories to explain the point. A must read for everybody, not just technology professionals. Way to go !!!"
2,The Minority,"A ton of people love this book...but a small minority does not. I'm afraid I belong with the latter. The first two chapters were almost unreadably slow, though things did pick up both emotionally and plotwise as the book went on. There's no doubt that it's well-written -- Robinson's prose is at turns lyrical and stark, but I never felt involved with any of the characters. It wasn't exactly that they weren't believable, but rather that their motivations were never made clear.But as you can see from the other glowing reviews, my reaction is atypical. You may very well love this book -- but just in case you don't, you're not alone!"
1,Housekeeping,"This is the kind of book that people congratulate themselves as understanding, thinking they have a poetic heart. They adore what they consider an elegiac word touching their own lyrical sensitivity.Housekeeping is well written. There is a skilled use of language. It tricks the senses and the unsuspecting. It is dull and tedious. There is an undercurrent of cruelty. I disliked the book and the author's pretensions."
3,library,"so many books nowadays, the american ones anyway, are tragic family tales. oh well. pg, pretty good"
5,The other side of the West,"'Housekeeping' shows the other, less heroic and legendary -- not to mention less masculine -- face of the interior Western United States. These are places of incredible natural beauty, but are they meant for human habitation? Can you set up housekeeping there? Should you try?"
4,"5 stars for writing, 3 for story","As a piece of writing, this book is sublime. Each sentence is a skillfully crafted work of art, and you want to slowly savor every phrase. However, unlike Robinson's other works, Home and Gilead, the characters in Housekeeping just did not speak to me. I found myself not caring very much about them or what they did, though I was compelled by the sheer beauty of the prose to keep reading about them! In short: masterfully written, but the story could have been more compelling."
4,A literary accomplishment - but a slughtly depressing book.,"Maybe I SHOULD give five stars to ""Housekeeping: a Novel"", due to its undeniable literary merits - but, really, it IS a little depressing. Which, of course, is not ""bad"" - it's just that I would not want to re-read this book.I APPRECIATE the book's qualities: but it's not quite the same thing as ""LOVING"" it.Well, I must say that, come to think of it, ""La Chute"", by Albert Camus, is ALSO a very depressing book - and a masterpiece... I hope someone here understands what I'm saying.."
2,Boring,"Not much of a plot, if any. Sylvie was the worst of all, although much of it was not her fault."
2,BORING!,"I was able to finish this book, unlike Gilead but this author is soooo boring! Will not read another by her, no matter what the reviews!"
2,Disappointing.,"By the time I read the first 50 pages I decided not to finish this book, which is very unusual for me. But this story did not seem to be worth the effort to read through to the end. For me ""Housekeeping"" didn't have the depth or compelling story line that I like. It was just a chronology of events related to characters the author did not make me care about. That's not what I'm looking for in a classic novel. I want a story that hooks me and draws me into what happens to the main characters. In spite of how highly it is rated, this one, I'm afraid, did not do that for me."
2,Housekeeping = a novel,It was totally depressing. I had to force miyselff to et through it!I haven't read th others yet. Will give you feedback later.
5,Great book,"Great book to accompany any graduate text on Linear Programming. This book is more heavily on practicality than on the theory. Use one book for the the theory and this book to help you workout problems, and see how the theory is applied."
1,Horrible!!!,"This movie is horrible! I would put it into the genre of ""pseudo-comedy"", meaning it tries to be funny, but just isn't. Its one of those movies that you laugh once at during the entire showing, and then at the end you turn to the person next to you, and say ""what the hell was all that about?"" I didn't do that I watched it alone, just saying that if you were with someone else!"
1,You must buy the worst movie ever made.,"This is the fist time I have ever felt strongly enough about a movie to write a review -- I bought this movie just so I could show people how no other movie could be worse than this. When I saw this movie the first time, I couldn't believe it. It was like a trainwreck at which I couldn't help stairing! There are so many big names in the cast I just had to believe that at some point it was going to turn around and get better. I still can't believe it but - IT DIDN'T!Why did they do it? Why did they release it? How did it go so bad? Maybe they just had fun making it or doing acid when they wrote, directed or acted in it. Maybe it's better if you watch it stoned. You just have to see it to believe it!"
1,Worst movie we ever saw!,"I would give this movie NO stars if they would let me! My husband and I have gone to the movies every week, for years and years. Sometimes more than once a week. We have only walked out of a theater on two movies in 15 years and this was one of them! Need I say more! Not funny and just plain stupid. It's surprising that we hated it so much, since we are John Candy and Chevy Chase fans."
4,This movie scares me,"It scares the crap out of me, actually. It's not so much a comedy as the embodying fear of being trapped in a nightmarish junk house populated my mutants, psychos and Chevy Chase. It's not what you would expect from the usual Aykroyd or Chase movie, but it is surreal and unique."
5,Strangest Movie Ever,This movie is one of the strangest ever and definitely worth purchasing if nothing but for the cameo of Humpty Hump and Digital Underground performing.This movie is surreal and full of suprizes.I remember seeing it in the movie theater when it first came out and wanting to own it back then too.
1,Nothing but junk,"This is supposed to be a comedy? A fine cast of movie comics including Chevy Chase, Dan Ackroyd, and the late John Candy are wasted in this more grotesque than funny tale of vacationers on their way to Atlantic City who get nabbed by the police for speeding and have to face a very eccentric judge and the citizens of a fictitious (thank heavens) town who make the Addams family look like well-adjusted people. The film really isn't funny at all and is not the least bit entertaining. If it comes on television, you'll probably change the channel to see what else is on."
1,"Really small, not what I expected","Wish this organizer was larger, It barely fits anything, I would need another one to fit my shower items and by husbands items, Even the soap was falling out of the top compartment."
4,20/20 Hangs together surprisingly well.,"A group effort from the late Sixties. Includes the hits ""Do It Again"" and ""I Can Hear Music"". Features the wonderfully complex SMILE fragments, ""Our Prayer"" and ""Cabinessence"". Dennis is well represented. Worth seeking out."
2,All wet!,"Classic Accesories Deluxe Tractor Cover - Black. It says it is weather proof, but after the first rain my seat was still full of water. For the price paid it's a major disappointment. Signed, Still All wet!"
2,A Reluctant Two Stars,"""Weather Resistant"" does not translate to waterproof and this one isn't - waterproof, that is. Each time it rains, the seat gets a puddle of water on it.There's a bit of a slump between the steering wheel and the top of the seat back and i'm guessing that allows the rain to pool a bit and then leak through.As a general cover, it's fine and i can't complain about that. the material is pretty heavyweight.I suppose i could get a garden shed and store the tractor in it, but putting up a three thousand dollar shed to protect a 1500 dollar tractor just doesn't seem right."
2,Not very compelling and kind of confusing too,"This is the first book I've read by Jon Jackson. I think there are other books with the same protagonists, and maybe if I'd read those first I would have liked this book better. I did not find the protagonists interesting at all. In fact, I found the villain--even though I think the author tried very hard to make him unlikeable--to be a more interesting and even occasionally compelling character. The plot had some trouble too...either I wasn't reading carefully enough, or there were some major unanswered questions about the motives of several characters. Last of all the author tended to use various names to refer to the same character (e.g. sometimes calling a person by his last name, sometimes his first, sometimes a title) and I thought this was a bit confusing since there are a lot of characters involved in the story.To summarize...this book was entertaining enough to finish, but mostly I was glad when it ended so I could start another book."
5,Never Received So Many Compliments,"I had this travel system on my registry, and I have to say it is the greatest! (The Fisher Price aqarium swing is heaven sent also!) I have never received so many compliments regarding an item, it's absolutely adorable. It's very easy to use and strolls easily on any surface (we like to walk). If I had to remark differently on anything, it would be the head support in the infant seat. As with any infant seat, you'll need to purchase additional support. You truly cannot go wrong with this item! Just be prepared to answer a bunch of questions as to where you purchase it, because people will stop you!"
5,Great system!!,"This is the most adorable system! I wanted something pink for my daughter and could not find anything I liked. I was a little hesitant to get this one since I did not see it in person, only online. It looked pretty cute online, and since it was pink I figured it would be ok. When it got here (in about 2-3 days!) I was so excited! It is SO MUCH cuter in person than online! It only took my husband about 10 minutes to put it together, if that even. We love it and recommend it to anyone having a little girl!"
2,Lost Opportunity,Am I the only person to be unimpressed by Greg Bears' Eon and Eternity? After reading Eon I thought that Eternity could not be any worse and it wasn't but only just. Basically I felt I needed maps and diagrams every few pages just to get my bearings. I'm sure the author was only too clear in his own mind of the geography of the place but he failed to impart it to me with any clarity! I was quite lost almost from the beginning and for enjoyment of these novels a clear understanding of the layout of the asteroid was essential especially the 7th chamber which was crucial. This is a pity because the potential for expanding the saga both within the asteroid and onto other worlds is infinite but I would find it hard to raise any interest as the mechanics of moving to other worlds was completely lost on me.All in all an opportunity missed hence only 2 stars ie by my system books I would be quite happy not to have read.
5,The 4th Way is ingenious!,"I am about halfway through this book but I give it a great review as it reinforces what I have felt about the world already deep inside me.Gurdjieff is a great master of the 4th way. The 4th way combines the way of the Fakir (physical), Monk (emotional), and Yogi (mental) with ordinary life. One does not have to live a life in seclusion to advance spiritually. In fact, this 4th way is considered to be a much quicker way of learning!The lessons are great, and take a lot of thought/feeling to sort through them and apply them to your life, but it is definately worth it! It ties in with the inner alchemy that we must work on ourselves.Some other books of interest would be-Laura Knight-Jadczyk's books: Secret History, The Wave, High Strangeness-Carlos Castaneda's books- I haven't read through the book, but have learned from excerpts"
5,If you Search for portions of truth then it is a must read,This book fell into my hands if by providence. Being a seeker of truth this book was a mystery to me untill just recently after other seekers came togther and networked their knowledge to find the missing puzzle pieces.Suggested reading for truth seekers:Gnosis - Boris MouravieffThe Secrect History of the World and how to get out alive - Laura Knight-Jakczyk
3,Fire engine,The two fire trucks were bought for my grandchildren. They love fire trucks and these were no exception. Since I did not play with them myself.....they were shipped to them in California....I cannot give any kind of factual feedback. They arrived on time and in excellent shape.
1,Puleeeeeeeze Lord help me just finish this book without gettng sick!,"Pendantic.....or downright boring, if you will, that's how I found this book. If one looks at the potential of this novel, you can't help but be frustrated reading it. The idea of a cold, calculated superkiller promises heart pounding action, and yet Johnstone delivers nothing but dull, disconnected and irrelevant sex scenes-- one after the other-- involving a teenaged homicidal loner who is somehow ""different"" than everyone else (God! How many times should an author say this about a character? Even middle school authors know that one should ""show it,not tell it."") Johnstone never really does develop the character to the point where anyone who is trying to understand him can do so without accepting the spoon fed drivel about him being born to kill, and that everyone in the world can see that except him. If you are looking for drama, you won't get it here."
3,Carburetor versus fuel injection,"When talking about 883 to 1200 conversion, is anybody taking into account that from 2006 on, carburetors no longer exist for Harleys? With the former, you just get a larger bore pair. With the injection pump, who is going to set his paws on it? Are there skilled personnel in the mech shops capable of doing it? Can you regulate the amount injected or you have to purchase a bigger gauge pump?They must be quite expensive.Does anybody elaborate on this?"
4,Florsheim Washington,"Very stylish appearing shoe with soft leather and good cushioning on the insole. Is comfortable right away. Fits true to length, but some may find a little on the narrow side. I am considering getting it in black also. Overall I was very happy with this shoe and the price."
3,It also ran,"Among the many legal/courtroom dramas I've seen, this one is no real standout. Some better than average acting and an interesting legal principle are appealing, but the plot and character interaction don't reel one in. I've reviewed several better flicks of this type...or just follow your own tastes to something more compelling."
2,Not what I expected,"I think the description of this item is misleading. All they've done is convert various government websites to PDF format and put them on a CD. The result, in my opinion, is more confusing and difficult to navigate than the websites themselves. I'd only recommend this to people without web access."
4,Nifty.,This little stainless steel toothpick holder is stylish with the flip back top. Fairly good quality for the price. Mine fell out of my pocket and got lost so I think I'll buy a different one with a clip or something.
2,Poor construction quality of this toothpick holder.,"I started out very happy with this toothpick holder but that feeling didn't last very long because after a few weeks the hinge that allowed me to open and close the holder fell apart. Since the only way to carry this holder was in a pocket, not having a working hinge meant that carrying toothpicks in this always resulted in the picks intermixing with whatever else was in that pocket at the time it would open, thereby meaning that I'd have to put a toothpick in my mouth that had made contact with things I really didn't want to be in my mouth. And, this holder wasn't terribly cheap to buy."
5,A classic,"If you grew up with the original, then this an awesome way to let your kids grow up with the same thing just animated:)"
5,News: Judaism has real traditions of meditation!,"The late great Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan combed the sources to discover the various traditions of meditation that had been passed down in the rabbinic tradition for centuries. Many of them are summarized here and explained in clear, helpful terms. If you're interested in developing a practice, you will probably want to read also MINDING THE TEMPLE OF THE SOUL by Tamar Frankiel and Judy Greenfeld, which integrates meditation with traditional prayer and conscious movement. Also, Rabbi Kaplan's MEDITATION AND KABBALAH and MEDITATION AND THE BIBLE are good supplements to enrich your background for understanding this book."
5,"Jean-Jacques D'Aoust, Ph.D. recommends","David Myers is well known for publishing some of the best college manuals for general psychology, that are used in a majority of colleges and universities. He is also a devoted Christian. Consequently, his recent book on Psychology Through the Eyes of Faith marks a testimony to his dual commitment to both scientific psychology and the orthodox Christian faith. Highly recommended."
1,Horrible.,"I never write reviews, but I felt compelled to after paying for this piece of absolute junk (read: $h!t). The static is unbearable, the speaker phone is inaudible at times, the antennas are extremely sensitive and touching them could result in a dropped call. Not to mention, the stored numbers across all phones have suddenly disappeared twice. I never returned these things because I thought I could just put up with it. I was so wrong. Buy a Panasonic and save yourself the trouble."
2,Worst for Static (out of a dozen that I've had),"This is no bargain. Very prone to static (even compared to my older sets) and terrible, terrible speakerphone (again inferior to 2 different older models that I have). Very bad. You've been warned. I'm a computer guy and don't really care, but felt compelled to at least put the warning out there."
4,Highly Original!,"I enjoy time-travel romances, but after a while, the plots start to become alike. Not this one!Tracy Hill dies while on a date at a bowling alley, and demands from ""The Three Stooges"" that she be given another chance....her way! Little does she know that while granting her conditions, they send her back to the 1800's. She becomes the new Nora, far more bold and outspoken that anyone can imagine. (Perhaps a trifle too bold?)This book has a lot of western adventure and even a smidge of mystery. It is interesting that all the players in Nora's new life were also players in her previous lives. Before I had read this book, the only one who had successfully pulled off the reincarnation story line was Jude Deveraux.A good read for anyone who enjoys humor and originality!"
5,English,This is an easy to understand English book. I had used an earlier edition in teaching and was excited to find the book.
4,From Dawn Til Dusk 1973 - 1988,From Dawn Til Dusk 1973 - 1988 is a compilation that spans the years 1973 to 1988 and represents their Pink/Blue Era. Tangerine Dream is not your regular pop or rock music and can be said to be a mix between experimental electronic music and experimental rock. Along with Kraftwerk they were pioneers with the use of the synthesiser. The booklet is quite sparse and contains very little information and no pictures. Dave Simpson has written some well written liner notes describing the history of the band up till the release of this compilation. 4/5.
2,Short lived singing career...for a reason,"Argh...she wasn't a very good singer but there is a youthful charm to some of her work. ""Don't Just Stand There,"" ""All Through the Day,"" and ""Say Something Funny"" are my favorites. But unless you were a devoted fan, I'd skip this one."
2,Equinox Ventshade,"Product was made to go into channel of window, however, this did not work well with the Chevrolet Equinox. Window kept hitting the ventshade, finally took them off and stuck on the outside of the channel with 3M two sided molding tape. Not designed that way, but it worked."
3,That Voice!,"I must admit that I'd like Zep a little better if not for Plant's vocals. Screeching is not singing.The unsung hero of this group was JP Jones. Underreated as a musician and composer and never given his just due.PG is probably my favorite Zeppelin recording, but it's not in the classic category by any means."
5,Classic rock perfection,"I have listened to many albums in my day, and I consider myself as one having an appreciation for quality music and excellent talent. My collection includes all the greatest releases from the best bands. None of them compare with Physical. It is my ""deserted-island"" album, and for some reason it actually gets better each time I listen to it."
5,Amazing!,"This is one of their best. If you love Zep, this one is a must. It just doesn't get any better than this! Turn it up and enjoy."
5,Amazing Classics,"""Kashmir"" and ""Ten Years Gone"" are amazing classics that I'll always love. What's always blown me away about Led Zeppelin is their range - both musical and lyrical. They jam and then a ballad can bring tears to your eyes, there's so much depth in their music. If you don't have this CD - you really will love it! I've been loving it for many, many years - since it first came out - and it NEVER gets old! It's awesome!"
2,All hail The DOGS of rock,"This album as most knowlegeable fans will tell you is the true Zeppelin magnum opus, not Led Zep IV. If you're thinking of getting it, well, I'm in a postion to do you a real favour. You might be better getting the Howlin' Wolf, Elmore James and Stevie Wonder albums that Zep were obviously listening to at the time they made these albums. But that leaves one of the few Zeppelin originals here, Kashmir, to marvel at. The greatest song, by Page and Plant's always modest admission, by quite possibly the greatest band the world has ever known, or ever will see. If you're thinking of downloading it, don't bother , because I can give it to you now with much less fuss. It goes..Duh duh duh...duh duh duh....duh duh duh, ( goes higher) duh duh duh... duh duh duh... (repeat for 9 minutes)And try Zeps other true classic, Whole Lotta Love, which goesDah dum duh dum dum.....dum.....dum....dum......dum......dah dum dah dum dum...dum ......Music doesn't get much better than this, people."
2,Not worth it for one good track,"Kashmir is at once haunting and grating, eerily beautiful. Easily the best track on this album.In My Time of Dying and Trampled Underfoot are also worth listening to, but most of the rest of the album is uninspired and forgettable. And this from a Zep fan."
5,bring out you dead....,"this sure is a classic, boys: but you shouldnt need me to tell you that, since you should be having this: he would say that each track on it is up there- high 'n' mighty. were really groovin' now. some of these tracks: trampled underfoot, kashmir, are real head music: for the mind before its for the ffet.ps- only the most diehard and least sane of zeppelin fans would disagree with the fact that around the time of presence (around '77), they were getting a bit boring: the youth needed a more 'authentic' 'keepin'-it-real' spokesman- which was presented by the hated (by you) 'punk' musicians pps-'probably hated'"
5,Smart crusher,"One if the best purchases I've made,I love it. I like that it's durable and it really grinds the herbs very fine."
3,woof!,bark bark bark woof woof howl bark woof. Fun movie for the cameos by aging actors. Try to guess who they are as you watch.
2,Puh-leese!,"I'm watching this almost 40-year-old film for the first time and I haven't read any reviews. But I have to say, and I'm probably quoting, ""The hero is a dog and so is the film."""
2,Terrible.,"Trying to catch all dog movies for my dog-loving five-year old. He was fine watching it, but I was bored to tears. Slow-moving. Waste of time."
5,Attractive robe,Cozy robe. Washed well. Large is more of an extra large. The color was not acqua but a lovely muted blue green gray!
2,poor customer service,"I tried to return this item, and found it almost impossible to do so. You needed to contact to company to obtain an RMA number, and this must be done via the web site. Despite repeated attempts, and RMA number was never sent. There is no way to contact the company by phone. None. Looking up a phone number on line is futile. You will find a number, but this is the fax number of the company. The ONLY way to contact the company is via e-mail, and in my experience, no one responded. I needed to pack up the robes in the mailing box without an RMA number and hope for the best. As for the quality of the robes, they are extremely heavy. If you are a body builder, I recommend them to you. But, if you are an average person, I cannot imagine walking around in a robe that weighs 15 pounds. I would not recommend ordering from this company."
2,Luxury Spa Robe - Where's the belt?,"I purchased this item for my wife and she loved it; however, after trying it on she discovered that the belt was missing. We thoroughly checked the packaging, but found nothing. The photo of the item clearly shows a belt and the robe has belt loops. Inquiries were fruitless. Lesson learned: if you buy something from Amazon, once they process your credit card and ship, SERVICE ENDS - PERIOD. I will rethink all my future purchases with Amazon, but they are so big, they don't really care about my business."
1,The essence of dreams??,"I found this book to be disappointing.. hardly any Edgar Cayce's readings in it.In addition, the book doesn't explain how dreams can be analyzed, what kind of dreams exist (1, 2, 3, of 4 dimensional (related to future, present, past?)).Recommendation:Dromen Paragnostisch verklaard (1984)By G. van der ZeeuwISBN 9020205668Publisher: Ankh-Hermes bvLanguage: Dutch"
5,Totally Wicked Funk and Beats,"This is one of the best albums I have ever bought and would thoroughly recommend this to anyone considering buying it. It is old school vs new school with some awesome mixing between oldies such as 'Spinning Wheel' and 'The Snake' and newies such as 'Gangster Trippin' and 'Hey You, What's that sound?' A totally eclectric album. A must have for your record collection"
1,Bad quality; not suitable for small children's eyes,"The songs are lovely in this DVD and it is incredibly creative. The people who produced it are very talented artistically. However, it is TERRIBLE for a toddler. It is way too busy and impossible to hear the songs properly because the music iis so hectic. The images move lightning speed anyway but it is very bad quality video - it's almost as though the images vibrate. Nice idea but don't ruin your child's eyes with this. I returned it for a refund."
1,Misleading,"The suggested list price is the case price (12 * 250) filters.The item being sold is one packet (250 filters) not a case.Would be a good deal if it was an entire case, but considering the shipping fees, it is very expensive for a single pack."
1,Broke the first time we used it!,"Maybe we just got a bad one, but one of the clips that holds the mill in place broke off the very first time we used it. I imagine it would have been fine if it didn't break, but the way the clips are attached seems cheap and poorly made to me."
2,Not that great,"The first time I used this it was on canned whole tomatoes to put into a sauce. I used the medium disk. The tomatoes mostly swirled around the pot for the first few minutes. After I packed them down with my fingers a few times and tried to slide them under the mashing disk, they eventually started going through better. But it was annoying and I feel a $50 food mill shouldn't do that. Then there was a lot of pulp stuck to the underside of the mill. I had to take a spatula to scrape it off into my sauce...my mom has a food mill that has a little arm that spins close to the bottom of her mill and it scrapes the food away as it gets pushed through. I REALLY wish this one had that but it does not and it's extra work. I kind of wish I returned this item. It's sturdy and is easy to assemble and take apart but it has problems that are not worth those two positive points. I wouldn't buy it for any one."
5,I Love It,"I got this for Christmas and have wanted it a long time. So far I've made tomato sauce, apple sauce and mashed potatoes and it has been fantastic. Easy to put together or change disks and easy to clean. The rubberized legs keep it from slipping on the bowl. The only suggestion I would have is for the legs to click in a down position so you can stand it over small bowls."
3,Works... Eventually,"The final product is fine, but the food is pushed around on the mill too easily. Frequent reversals are required to keep the food under the paddle and being forced through the grate, and it takes far too long to finish because of that."
4,wish it were bigger,"It worked great. I just had to do smaller batches, but it made my holiday sweet potatoe pie baking so much easier, I didnt need to strain the potatoes."
3,smooth operation,"The foodmill works quite well. The handle turns smoothly and makes sauce making very easy. Only gripe, is the lack of stability. The supports don't fit in any of my bowls, so it a little wobbly. Otherwise, nice product. Easy to clean too."
4,If You've Been Wanting One...This Is It,"I've had my eye on getting a food mill for awhile. If you're like me you've hesitated at getting a 'good' one for several hundred dollars a few times and decided to spend the money on something else. I finally bit the bullet and bought this to make baby food after seeing the good reviews and the price tag. I must say after using it a few times today it's fantastic! It pureed potatoes and peas like a champ so far. The clean up is also a breeze as is changing the discs out. I have nightmares of my Mom's from childhood that had a bolt and nuts and washers and springs to reassemble and clean. Not so with this model. The horizontal bar has a quick release and it pops right apart. A quick rinse right after use and a scrub here and there and done. Easy and efficient. I can't speak to the durability as of yet, but it seems study and the rubber legs gripped the bowl below perfectly. Don't wait if you've been wanting one. Great."
3,Best for sauce or juice.,"The positive features are the comfortable handles and gripping legs that fit on a fairly large bowl. There really was no slippage and overall it made it easy to turn. The mill holds a pretty descent quanity of food. I specifically bought this food mill to rice potatoes to make lefse. The potatoes stuck to the sides of the ricer and the paddle part did not pull the potatoes underneath it to the blade. I had to use a spoon to mash them down so that paddle could catch them. I riced 40 pounds of potatoes so by the end I was actually quite frustrated. I would imagine this food mill is great for applesauce or tomato juice. Some food mills have a small wire that turns along the underside to keep the bottom clean. This food mill doesn't have it which might be a nice enhancement although again needed more for ricing potatoes than making juice or sauce. If the paddle part would be bent up just a bit higher, I think it would grab the potatoes better."
4,Tomatoes and apples,The mill did good on makeing tomatoe sauce and apple sauce. It works quickly and is easy to clean.
2,great story but not my cup of tea...,"i got this cool looking book to read from a friend. i think i expected something different, not so scientific and detailed. Unbelievable story if its turns out to be truth , though. Award winning author who holds a BSME degree from Cornell U. worked for Lockheed Martin where he was in charge of planning and analysis of flight tests for the Navy Polaris Underwater Launch Missile System. He must be a highly credible person. You must like and understand all the details witch i had no intention to get into . Good luck"
1,no accessories,"I was going to purchase a Ryobi edger until I found that no accessories,such as batteries were sold in the store. If I ever needed a new battery I would not be able to buy one without sending away for it through the mail. Ryobi should support the equipmet they sell in the stores."
1,Fight - War of Words DVD - LET DOWN,"The concert was done in a montage where they use excerpts from several different shows to compile what is supposed to be a complete concert. Then it is set to the audio, that is supposed to be untouched/altered (Yeah, Right), to the make shift concert. IT'S LIKE A BAD POISON VIDEO! So your are basically watching them lip sync. Anybody remember Milli Vanilli? Who knows where the audio was actually sourced. If you are a diehard Fight Fan then you will be disappointed, you should avoid this like the plague, and seek any of the bootleg shows that are readily available."
5,a pleasant suprise,"I listen to hundreds of blues CD's a year, and comment on very few of them. If you have come this far, and are interested in Aynsley's music, buy this CD. He writes some great blues/rock tunes and has a suprisingly mature sound. He also does a few covers - an amazing version of Little Wing that moves into a hidden acoustic track that smokes."
4,first time listener,stumbled upon this guy by accident and then listened to whole album on Spiral Frog (sorry Amazon)... Angel o' Mine is a superb track; 'I Believe' and 'Need her so bad' (slow blues) are excellent too. The others are OK.. good solid blues rock but nothing to knock your socks off. I'm not a big fan of covers (viz Little Wing) but it is decent for sure. Bottom line this guy is worth a listen.
4,a hoot,"Russell looks and sounds like stuffy old bird, but he has a wonderful sense of humour.When he writes, almost every sentence is quotable. He does not beat around the bush and pad like so many other writers.He is more amused than irritated by the religious crazies."
3,Great introduction but for the hardend Atheist/Agnostic? Nah,"I have very mixed feelings about this collection of essays. If I had read it 5 or 6 years ago, I would have considered it genius. But today? I've heard these same arguments over and over again. Well, to focus on the positive, Lord Russell does put a few ideas that, while not to terribly original, are thought provoking nonetheless. He says some interesting things about Tom Paine, makes some interesting comments on Democracy and Education, and rational morality. On the other hand, Russell too often acts as a priest of the religion of Science. I won't deny the importance of science to the advancement of civilization, but when it becomes a Dogma it is no better than Christian ignorance. Overall...if you are a doubtful Christian, read this book. It will be a godsend. If you are alread a freethinker, there really isn't any point. Your time could be spent better somewhere else, certianly."
3,Starts with a flawed premise,"Russell takes on religion from a flawed perspective. He focuses on the religious literalism that puts off so many people and proceeds to dismantle Christianity based on this interpretation. A better title might be ""Why I Am Not a Fundamentalist."" It would be more interesting if he challenged the literalism that can make religion divisive or irrelevant, but also explored the roots of religion and the role of religion in addressing issues that logic simply cannot touch."
2,Biggest egotrip in the history of music,"Tchaikovsky's first piano concerto has been recorded hundreds of times and one would expect something brilliant from these two stars. However, just as with the Richter/Karajan version, the combination of geniuses doesn't work and the result is incoherent to say the least.Much better alternatives are the ravishing Argerich/Abbado, the beautifully controlled Pletnev/Fedoseyev and the classic Gilels/Reiner. Get one of those instead!"
3,Good story - strange relationship,I liked this book although I only gave it 3 stars. What I didn't like was the relationship between the brother and sister. Mr. Irving has a strange slant on life if you have read any of his books but it makes for interesting reading.
3,Very good book,The Hotel New Hampsire is a very good book. It was the first time i read a book from Irving but I really like his style Can someone explain me the theories of Freud that are hidden in this book?
2,Fascinating characters but living in a debauched world.,"John Irving is too good of a writer to waste such fine characterizations in such a poorly thought out world. Granted there is a relationship between the Berry's and their sexual (and incestuous) miscapades. I enjoyed the wonderful manifestations of Sorrow and the ridiculousness of Suzie the Bear. Unfortunately all the characters are drawn down into a world of pornographers, lesbianism, incest and prostitution. Falls so far short of A Prayer for Owen Meany, I got to wonder if the same author wrote both."
1,Really Substandard Irving,"I totally agree with Melanie D. about this book, but disagree about OWEN MEANY --- really, really dull. Give me GARP any day !"
3,Okay Read,Definitely not his best work. Maybe I'll re-read it in a couple years and find something I've missed. A Prayer for Owen Meany and A Widow for One Year are my favorites. Try those on for size.
5,Brilliant!,"This is now possibly one of my favourite books ever along with Great Expectations and Captain Corelli's Mandolin. It is incredibly funny, gripping, touching and imaginative. Go read this book now and you won't be disappointed. (Don't read it in too public a place though because people will start giving you funny looks when you start laughing out loud!)"
2,"Love Frost, but not in Kindle format","Yes, the book was inexpensive on Kindle, but I had hoped to listen to the automaton read his words. Forget it. Just a garble of lines and poems run together.Some books actually sound okay on the auto reader. Not this one.Buy a good compilation of Frost hardcover, or look up individual poems on the internet, but this is the wrong format."
5,What profits a man to gain the world......,"Mercy,Mercy Me a story of greed,power,pride,lies and distruction a powerfully written inspriational story. This book was hard to put down, a well put together plot and storyline. A must buy!"
3,SX700R 2-Way Radios,These are not great for long distances (> 2 miles) as advertised but they worked very well for the purpose we bought them. We used them on a cruise ship and they were fine. I think the extra interference channels made a difference because there were a lot of folks on board with similar radios and our channel was never once interfered with.The belt clips are WAY better than the ones from previous generation Motos.
2,12 mile range? Not even.,"I can back up the reviewer who said the 12 mile range is a lie. We have owned these Motorola SX700R Talkabouts since last July, 2006. We have tested these Talkabouts from LESS than a mile away, two different directions from home, and the reception was poor to non-existent in one direction and average to poor the other. The only obstructions were trees. And remember this is less than one mile apart. The sound quality and reception were awful.If you want something to use around the house, house to yard, yard to yard, very close to home, it will work fine. Reception and sound quality are excellent at close range. But if you want something to communicate with one mile or more apart, look elsewhere. This won't do it."
4,Good product for the money,"This radio set is a good deal for the price. A 2watt output radio would maybe reach 12 miles on the ocean or in the plains, but for the most part that's not where we use them. They should have advertised the average range not maximum in perfect conditions. The uneducated customer will buy into these thinking they can use these through 12 miles of walls, trees, or dirt, that's not the case. 1 mile through wooded area is minimum I would say from my testing. Products I have purchased in the past that cost more for one instead of a pair did less."
1,12 miles range?,i bought the sx700r in july of 05 to use between two cars in malls and theme parks in florida for my recent holidays. the range of the product is 12 miles and this is the reason i ordered this motorola radio as it is the longest range advertised on all their 2 ways. in real terms the 12 miles is really only 3/4 of a mile. yes not even 1 mile. disappointed i contacted motorola on their american helpline and they said it is because electrial/land features and only 12 miles point to point on flat land will achieve 12 miles i would not recommend this product if over 3/4 of a mile is what u want brian
1,Waste of money,The real world distance that you going to get out of this radio is whooping 0.6 miles!!!That is it. I was hoping Motorola would inflate the advertised range by 2 or 3 times but to have 0.6 with advertised 16 miles that is just laughable. I've tested it in the hills upstate New York. Worthless but makes nice beeping sounds.
2,"Works, but be careful","If you are looking for the actual ""12 mile"" radius that these radios are advertised as, you will be disappointed. In a large metropolitan, suburban setting, my actual range was about 1 mile.We purchased these thinking if we only got half of the 12-mile range, that would be fine. But a one-mile radius is unacceptable.Having said that, they do work in a range of one mile or less without any problem."
4,"We have 20, they work great!","Reasonably durable, consistant performers. Excellant range, useful features. I wish they were a little smaller, but they aren't too bad."
2,.6 not 12,"I was quite displeased with these radios. It says that they work up to 12-mile range. I understand that that is in optimal conditions. I bought them hopping that I could use them at school, but on campus they barely reached 400 yards. And while a friend stood on a street corner (off campus) I was on the same street but only .6 miles away when I finally could hear him. I researched 2-way radios for a bit and these got good reviews, but just weren't up to par, I think I'll buy some $20 ones if I want to talk within a building...Motorola Talkabout FV200AA GMRS / FRS Two-way Radio (Pair)I assume I am going to have to go with something a bit heftier...I thought the weather radio was a nice add-on and it seems like there are plenty of combinations to keep out heavy traffic. I have had better luck in the past years with Motorola.**Also in the pictures it show 2 chargers, but it only comes with ONE dual POCKET charger."
4,Great for family vacations,"I got these for our family trip to Disney and we had 6 adults, two babies and one 5 year old...they pretty much made the trip a breeze between napping babies, long lines for rides, etc so we could split up and easily find each other. We could keep all of the groups updated and never had any problems getting ahold of one another and very little interference on the channels. My only complaint would be they are a bit large, but the guys all wore backpacks and just clipped them on to the straps which kept them closer to their ears anyway for better hearing. Vibration alert was really helpful too in noisy areas."
1,Waste of money... buy another book,"I am sorry that I laid out money for this waste of paper. There are very few games and the pedagogy is so simplistic as to be laughable. Considering the author's ""PhD"" is from a diploma mill, I guess I shouldn't be surprised.Shop elsewhere! there are many other useful books out there!"
5,Welcome Back,"If you loved it as a kid, you'll love it now!! If you haven't been introduced to this throwback to a simpler age, it does have its charms."
4,i still have my original from 1977,"It still works great. i must be lucky. i played it just last week with my big brother. After 25 years, mine still works and it is still fun. Well, sort of fun."
4,"Ahh, but it is like the original...","I have one of these...the original, over 20 years old, and it still works! I pulled it from a box in the basement, popped in a battery and boom, the Mattel Bowl was on! And just as much fun as it was 20 years ago.I have to disagree with the buyer who said it wasn't like the original...in the original Football, you couldn't pass or run backwards. I think you might be confusing Football and Football II (in a brown case) which did allow backwards runs and passes."
1,downgraded for poor longevity/ zero projection,"While this scent is fairly nice for the winter, alas 4 sprays are barely discernible some 1 or 2 hours later, thus I am downgrading a fragrance I like but would not purchase again. It won't ""offend"" anyone but that's only because they won't be able to smell it. Really more of a ""body spray""- read mostly alcohol. Like many perfumes in this price category, basically a waste of money."
3,Get Kaplan instead.,"I highly recommend the Kaplan Literature review. This book is short on practice tests. It only offers three, and the review is almost useless. The practice tests are way too hard compared to College Board's tests. I would just get this book if I needed additional practice."
4,Works great but expensive,"I tried this and the Kiehl's Facial Fuel lotion. The MenScience brand definitely worked better for me, less greasy and light. My only complaint is it's too pricey, although a little goes a long way."
4,It is good!,"It works very well. Very light and doesn't feel greasy. You don't have to use a lot of it each time, little amount will be enough and therefore it will last a long time. So you get your money's worth. I would recommend it!"
5,Great product.,I've used many other facial lotions before but none compare to this one. Such a high quality product.
2,Odd smelling product,"I changed from Baxter of California to MenScience, but the MenScience smells like mildew. While this is a step up from Baxter, which smelled like a urinal, I'm thinking male AHA and BHA products may just be a waste of money."
2,Too many pills... Grinding them is better,There are just too many pills that have to be taken for a good dose of wheat grass. I'm not a pill phobe but I just can't take 14 plus of these pills a day. What I ended up doing was using my Ninja blender to make a powder out of the pills. Now I add them to my smoothies. Great alternative!
2,Why so many titles?,"This is the paperback edition of the book that appeared earlier in hardcover as ""The Anti-aging Zone"" (in my opinion, a better title). I suggest that it is better to read ""Enter the Zone"" instead of or before reading this one. I have reservations about recommending this book because there are some obvious mis-statements that should have been caught by an editor, a great deal of boring repetition, and some very stretched analogies (e.g. pages 32 and 50). The persistent reader might reach a point where they are rewarded by more details of biochemical mechanisms than are given in the earlier books. The tables of food amounts are different from those in the other books and appear to be intermediate between the earlier version of ""Enter the Zone"" and the later amounts of ""The top 100 zone foods""."
2,Didn't enjoy at all,"I had read so many good comments about this book, so I bought it to give it a try and didn't like it at all. There were so many pages of useless information and the ending was ridiculous. I wish I had read another one of Koontz's books first."
4,Not Bad!,"This book is a very good work of the author. I realy enjoyed while reading it. It's about a charmed doll. You will enjoy it too if you liked ""Chuky""(the movie)."
2,every kind of bad,"The characters in this book were just terrible. The protagonist is neurotic, uptight, and way too slow on the uptake. His love interest is a self-satisfied new age hippie chick whom we're supposed to admire but who is just irritating as all get-out. Their dialogue is ineptly smartassed the whole way through.Don't look for the plot to save the day. While it admittedly made me want at times to know what would happen next (which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1), it was very disappointing in its resolution.I listened to the audiobook, so I will give Mr. Koontz the benefit of the doubt that maybe something was lost in the abridgement. But I doubt it, as the pace was fairly slow. This was my first and last Koontz experience.The narrator was good but that's cold comfort all things considered."
1,The second worst Dean Koontz book ever!,"This book is one of the worst Dean Koontz books ever.""The Servants Of Twilight"",""The Voice Of The Night"",""The Face Of Fear',and ""Intensity"".The plot is stupid,the characters are unmemorable,and it isn't scary.This is,however,not as bad as ""Lightning""."
2,Very Comedic,"Being an avid Koontz fan, and one who commutes about one hour each way for work, I found listening to this that I often found myself laughing and the story very predictable. By far, this was not one of his better books."
3,It was OK,"It was light reading, but a little drawn out. It seamed to be both intense and comedic at the same time."
5,Fun read...very un-Koontz,"After just finishing Dark Rivers of the Heart, this is a very un-Koontz novel. The other reviewers have already written the synopsis so there is no need for me to do so. I enjoyed the cast of colorful characters and the crazy humor. This book is a bit of horror and lots of action and comedy. I highly recommend it."
5,Totally cool,"One of the coolist books I've read in a while. Makes me think twice about aliens and making my Mom mad at me. If I didn't work so much I would read it a few more times, along with the rest of his books. It gives your imagination a run for it's money."
5,loved it,This is a book that you just need to have fun with. Dont expect it to always be logical or believable.The characters are unique and will keep you laughing.I finished it wishing that I actually knew Del and Tommy. I thought it was a nice break from Koontz's usuals.Its a great one-sit read for anyone who likes a surprise mixed with a little romance. I wouldnt recommend this for any hard-core horror fans. Enjoy! I know I did.
3,TickTock Not So Hot,"I was a little disapointed with this book. I am a big Koontz fan, but this novel fell a little short. It wasn't as humorous as I expected, and I felt that the ending was horrible. The explanation given for the strange occurences just fell short of the story. Tommy and Del, the two main characters were however very entertaining. I hope Koontz will write more novels for this pair. My reccommendation would be to wait on this book. If Koontz comes up with more stories involving these two characters, then read 'TickTock' for an introduction into the two. Otherwise, I think you'd be more satisfied with a different novel."
1,How can so many people love this book? Too weird!,"This is the 3rd Dean Koontz book I've read, and I have to say that it is one of his worst. I have read many other really good, suspensful books (Watchers, The Door to December) that by far surpass this book. I barely even finished it (took me 3 months). I would much rather read a book about some crazed psycopath on the loose (God help me!) than to read about some alien thing hidden inside a doll. I was very disappointed. It just slowly dragged on and on, until I figured I might as well put the book down before I fall asleep with the it in my hands and loose the page I'm on. I've found that was the biggest concern I had, falling asleep. I hope Dean Koontz never writes another novel like this again!"
4,Thoroughly enjoyable!,This was really a different book. I really enjoyed it. Not too scary or intense but just enough creepiness mixed with humor and great characters. I loved it!
4,Last of the best.,"Number 5 is the last of the first 5 solid albums from the Steve Miller Band. It's a little weaker than it's predecessors, but offers some fine music before Steve decided to hit the more mainstream pop rock sound.You can't go wrong with any of these fine albums which come from the most creative time in Rock, the late sixties to early seventies."
2,Almost Good!,"The Motor on the 890R is pretty good. My problem is the dang thing is so heavy. My right arm hurts for days after weedeating. If it was lighter in weight, this would be a lot better product. The motor will jerk a knot in your shoulder sometimes while cranking."
5,"Love this, won't use anything else","I love these organic tampons an can't find organic tampons of any sort at local stores. These are great for a reasonable price. Just wish I could get them on Prime (hint hint, Amazon)."
2,Why is Jim Norton on the cover?,"A down on his luck bar owner and a collection of his misfits friends plot a hair-brained scheme to rip off a local post office. Among those friends is an old lady with massive bingo wings, a guido who probably flunked out of the 8th grade, and Jim Norton, the reason most people watched this low budget excuse for a movie. Norton's stupid face receives very little screen time, and he's given even less time to unleash the crude jokes on which he's built a modest career and a rabid following.Putting Norton on the cover is disingenuous at best, since his performance is so understated and far from a comedy routine that includes disturbed quips about Dakota Fanning. Very disappointed. This is obviously low budget and the actors are below average. The reason to watch it is Norton, and he's restrained to the point of boredom. Watch a few Comedy Central roasts instead; you'll get more comedy.Jason Elin"
3,Boring,"I bought this book to use for a school paper. For that reason, this book was a very good one to use and I'm glad I chose this one. It's very informative and helpful. But, it's a little wordy and not interesting. I wouldn't read it for pleasure. It was in excellent condition; no marks, torn pages, etc."
3,"Nice, but ...","While this is a very good document, it isn't the ART book I had hoped it would be. As an artist, I learn far more visually than I do from all the talking. I wanted a book of plates with some discription. I got a lot of expensive discription and not very many illustrations and even fewer close-ups and details. If you are an illuminator, this may not be the book you want it to be. If you are looking for a history book, I'm sure it will be a nice addition to your library."
5,Nice book.,This is a great book and is very easy to read. I recommend it to anyone who loves to learn those little tidbits about the best football team ever.Ed Bouchette wrote a terrific book.Pedro
4,This fine raw-boned ANIME is not a US vampire TV show,"The bozos below are ranting on about some mainstream US TV vampire show that got canned.This anime is not at all related to that network show. It opens with two mountain climbers boffing some hot Sherpa ladies on their way up Everest. Drinking, smoking, sex, adventure... this is a testosterone flooded over-the-top extravaganza that somewhat to our surprise both my wife and I are really enjoying. For those of us that grew up living & breathing the space race in the '60s, a show that says you can get up there with enough guts and will really warms our hearts.It's X-file conspiracies, Kimball Kinnison space opera, Tom Swift genius engineer... all in one. So far it has the emotional introspection of The A-Team, so it's not on the shoujou side of the fence, but both a guy who sobbs through Fruits Basket and a gal who loves Patlabor Mobile Police find this to be a primo series."
4,On the High Frontier,"A very nice new anime themed on the opening of the new commercial space frontier. By the time the story starts, the various national space programs are well underway and lunar energy commercialization has started. The national programs are to be merged into an international one. We follow the story of our two protagonists, one American, one Japanese as they inexorably find their way to becoming astronauts.The plot isn't new, with many elements recognizable from SF. The animation is generally very good, wand some of it excellent. The dialog is quite adult for the most part. The music is very reminiscent of that of the HBO series ""To the Moon"", for which this anime pays some hommage I think.I gave this 4 stars rather than five which I would give to the best anime has to offer, e.g. ""Ghost in the Shell"", ""Wings of Honneamise""."
2,I never ended up reading this,"Bought this for a class I was taking and then I ended up dropping the class. So I never even read this book. Anyone want to buy it? Brand new, never read."
2,Titanic: Sinks Again!,"I love hidden object games when I play them online but seem to be disappointed with them when I get the entire game. The online Titanic: Hidden Expedition was fun because you could click everything you found quickly. On the full version, you have to wait for the object to float out of sight or you lose time.I also didn't like the fact that it basically advertises cigarettes, pipes, drinking, guns, knives, swords, and even a mask resembling the devil. None of these things are good things to be advertising to anyone... especially kids. Terribly sad to have this kind of thing on a game that could be such fun."
1,where is my game?,"I would love to give a review of this game but I ordered this game over a month ago and still havent got it they tell me it will be delivered on one date and then change it to another date when that date arrives. and now they have changed the name of the game I am spose to get hunt for the lost tresure I dont know what is going on it would be nice if someone would let me know what is going on as for a review I guess i have to say poor because they wont send it to me,"
5,Love that Gary Puckett!,"Wow, this Greatest Hits CD is wonderful - especially love ""Woman, Woman"" (of course), and ""Could I"", a beautiful song which was written by Gary Puckett. Took me right down memory lane, back to the 60's!"
4,"Not New Wakeman,But Better Than The Movie","I originally purchased the soundtrack of the Ken Russell ""disaster"", ""Lisztomania"" way back when the movie came and went....I loved the music. I'm not a classical music expertor purist,but I liked then, what I still like now with this release...an interesting interpretation of Liszt by Rick Wakeman,and Roger Daltrey. I was pleased when the announcement was made that this album was returning in Wakeman's original version whichhe reportedly had submitted for the film....the soundtrack isvery hard to find, so this version for me was a ""welcome surprise""! If you're into Wakeman...and are sentimental aboutthe decade the film was made, including Tommy....you'll enjoy it.If you hate any attempt by Rick Wakeman or others to recordinterpretations of Franz Liszt's music or any of the ""masters""...you'll hate it, and Roger Daltry's vocals...I loved it!Regina"
3,Spaghetti Western,"A solid double feature in the vain of spaghetti westerns, must be a fan of the genre to enjoy these movies. Not just a standard western movie."
5,Love these!,"I'm not sure who would buy these to just 'toss' but these are the go to baby spoon in our house. They are a great price and we aren't all that upset if we lose one. Mostly, we use them while at home. They are easy to clean and my son is able to easily hold them on his own."
3,Needs different blade,The blade on this thing is just a flat dull bar. It needs to have a sharpened offset blade to work well.
1,Awkward to Use,"I had owned a Ryobi gas string trimmer with the ability to add on other tools previously. Went to Home Depot and again purchased a Ryobi gas trimmer to replace an older one but found that Ryobi was out of the accessory business and the only edger available was the Expand-It by Homelite.This tool in no way compares to the Ryobi I owned previously. It has a curved shaft that makes it too short for a 6' tall or taller person to use and the curve makes its use awkward at best. I find that my wrists ache after each usage and since I have to stoop, my back hurts also.In half of one season I wore the 9"" blade down to 5 inches and when I returned to HomeDepot for a replacement I learned that they dont carry the replacement parts.Do yourself a favor and buy something else. I have a couple of weeks left to mow and edge and my Ryobi becomes a full time string trimmer and Im going to buy something quality to edge with."
1,Poor for users of hearing aids,"This phone advertises that it is good for people with mild hearing loss. I hoped it would be good for someone wearing behind the ear hearing aids. Not so. I could not get the telecoil in my hearing aids to sync with the phone. And even with the volume set at maximum, I could not hear the voice at the other end of the line. I returned the phone and replaced it with Panasonic KX-TG9332 which is also DECT 6.0. It is not especially recommended for the hearing impaired but I am able to use the telecoil on my hearing aids with the phone and the voice on the other end is clear. Also, the manual for the Panasonic is well written which is not the case for the GE.Reviews for phones seldom mention hearing aid users. I hope this will be helpful for those with hearing aids."
1,terrible cover,"I got it very cheap. I was only interested in the cover picture, unfotunately, the cover was HEAVILY worn, to the point you couldn't make out the cover all that well. All the other parts of the magazine were perfect, but the cover, the one thing I wanted, was terrible.Honestly, I would like just a poster of the cover. I don't know if that is possible, but that is what I'm looking for. Since this didn't meet my expectations, I have to give it 1 star. Otherwise, it was in good condition."
3,Don't use it much,I didn't find this book to be as informative as I thought it might be. It wasn't very useful to me and I have since given it away.
4,Good choice,I bought this book because my daughter is a diabetic & I was looking for new recipes to try in the slow cooker. I've only tried 4 recipes so far& they were all good.
4,A Gem for Lazy Cooks,"Diabetes runs in my family and my fiance' is pre-diabetic so it's important to watch our diets. However, not being a huge fan of the kitchen and busy besides this is the perfect thing for me! Used one of the recipes last night and it was fabulous. However, many of the recipes call for being served over rice or noodles, which can up the carb count considerably so be sure to use whole grain pastas on those!"
2,This product does not fit in my car!,This product does not fit in my car and I bought it because the product tell me: This product fits your 2002 Suzuki Aerio and is bigest than I need.
3,An excellent French comedy definitely worth seeong.,"I saw this picture at the Saigon Theatre on Tudo Street (formerly Rue Catinet) in 1967. Although the Enlish, Vietnamese and Chinese sub-titles were consfusing it is still an easy story line to pick up and follow. Perhaps the enjoyable moment was the English lesson. None of the four gendarmes preparing to visit New York speak any English. The inspector dutifully attempts to teach his superior English in an attempt to gain his favor. The superior can only comprehend one phrase, ""the flowers are very beautiful."" Nonetheless, the inspector dubbs him his ""best pupil."" At every introduction to dignitaries the captain smiles and states ""The flowers are very beautiful."" The remainder of the movie is good, wholesome slapstick comedy somewhat reminicent of the Three Stooges, Abbot and Costello and Laurel and Hardy."
3,The summary doesn't match the movie,"While the movie summary states Romeo tries to help one of his friends, the movie is mainly about him trying to be the best. In fact you really don't even see Don that much.You can tell this was a Master P production as most of the cast is either from Master P's label or Romeo's show on Nick. You even have a cameo by John Witherspoon (whose name is misspelled in the credits.)The only extras the film has is Romeo's 4 videos and two trailers. The bonus cd is Romeo's God's Gift cd."
5,A Winner!,"Jeff Herman's Writer's Guide provides more information about publishing resources than any other book I've seen on the market. Much of the reason that my business partner and I have had so much success in matching writers with legitimate editors and agents is due to books such as this. It's a tool when it comes to marketing. When you open the book to that first page, you're entering a world of opportunity.Francesca Vrattos Cofounder Writers' Showplace Inc."
1,Self-promoting book by self-promoting author,"I got this book from a friend last Xmas. He didn't know whether to get this one or the old standard, the Writer's Market. He chose the wrong one.The book is not worthless, but nor is it very good. The author, Jeff Herman, spends a lot of the book congratulating himself on his successful ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" series. (Frankly, I'm not that impressed with such a tiresome and saccharine series, but it's made him wealthy.)He's an agent himself, and likes to pretend that he's doing potential writers a favor by giving more in-depth info on a limited number of agents. Who cares what an agent does in his spare time? We don't, and the agents probably don't care if writers know that either. Skip it."

1,Don't do it! This product arrived shattered - TWICE!!,"Do not order this product from Amazon! The shipping method was TERRIBLE. They did not secure the ceramic bowls or pack them correctly when I ordered the replacement, they shipped it again the same way - and guess what??!! SHATTERED AGAIN! When I tried the online-return they wanted me to pay for shipping. So I had to spend time on the phone - I'm STILL waiting for printing lables that were supposed to be emailed to me -and I've been charged for the product.I ended up going to PetSmart and getting the same thing - which is what I was trying to avoid to begin with."
5,Great card game!,This is a card game which moves quickly and teaches kids (and adults!) how to use some strategy and their memory. Great family fun!
5,I Have Never Been Disappointed,"I have one acre with a lot of trees. This prunner is light weight, sharp, and makes fast work of the job. Four inch branches, or small trees are no problem for this trimmer. I've owned mine for four years, and replaced the blade once. Reccommend the shoulder strap for more comfort."
4,works as advertised,"It does what they say it will - cut up to 4"" limb.The only complaint that i have is that you really can't get it up all that high to cut much that isn't close to the ground. Works great trimming heavy brush so you can reach in and saw off the tops of the bush."
5,Terrific indie feel with an unbelieveable lineup!,"This is one of Herbie's best albums. With an all-star lineup and a terrific independent movie to go along with it, this is one of my favorites. It goes from funky jazz-pop like ""Bring Down the Birds"" to raw rock and roll from the Yardbirds back to super-chill lounge straight out of that wood-paneled rumpus-room your parents had in the finished basement.If you're already a jazz buff and you think you have everything, you need this album. Just the personnel on this one should be enough for you. If you're new to jazz, this is a good place to start, too. It's extremely accessible and stays closer to earth than some of Herbie's more popular work from the 70's.Either way, this is a must-have for any jazz collection, and I wholeheartedly recommend it."
5,Traveling vicariously,"I really enjoyed this book. The cover seduced me. The graphic layout of each chapter was refreshingly different. But the words themselves halted me in my tracks. Shay Youngblood is a talented writer. Eden, the protagonist, is a complex young woman on a journey many of us dream of taking. I enjoyed being included on her trip. I hope people who have enjoyed Toni Morrison and Alice Walker will read the words of the future heir apparent."
1,"A dream, or a joke?","I picked up this book to remind me of Paris and have been very disappointed. The descriptions of Paris are completely unconvincing, vague, as if they were learned from guidebooks. The author's observations about life and people are poetic, but unoriginal and shallow. The lead character (and narrator) talks about wanting to go to Paris to find independence and unleash her creativity, but once there, she is so judgmental about the people she meets, I wondered why she kept trying to find new ways to earn enough money to stay. In the end, I couldn't tell if the narrator was dreaming about a visit she couldn't afford, or if the book was a long, elaborate joke about the futility of following in the footsteps of great writers."
1,a failed effort,"Youngblood should write poetry, a much shorter literary form that would enable her better to control her ""storytelling"" which, in this book, fails in a somewhat embarrassing way, weighed down as it is by a predictable plot, clumsy writing and lots of cliches."
3,It was okay..,"I have many yoga videos, and this one is wonderful if you are interested in more of a traditional video, but with a.little.bit of modern also. Great for women!"
5,Mother Loves it.,"Bought this for a Christmas gift for my mother, she absolutely loves the gift set. Definitely consider if you are looking for a quick gift."
5,Awesome !,Product got here in two days !!!!!! I was super excited about that and it smells amazing ! Can't go wrong with a classic like Curve.
5,"Incredible, wonderful books",I've enjoyed these books since I was five or six. Now my kids love them also! I cannot highly recommend these books enough to anyone who loves children's fiction.
5,Great entertainment...,"Like many other reviewers listed previously, I was surfing the channels in a hotel room one morning and I stumbled upon this gem. I missed the very beginning of the movie and had a hell of a time finding the actual title. I had to search online for ""...dairy causes diarrhea...creamy, chunky butter cheese..."" to find that CHEATS was the title. That being said, I found this movie to be humourous, entertaining, and like a trip back to high school. Anyone who enjoys comedy from the greats such as Sandler, Farley, Spade, Ferrell, Myers, etc. would simply love this flick. I can't believe that it never made it to theaters in an early summer release to attract the high school crowd. Enough said...Great movie."
1,Close... but Not compatible with 2012 Honda Odyssey EXL,"After much research for a car top carrier for my 2012 Honda Odyssey EXL, I found this product which showed that it would fit. I was excited to give it a try when it arrived. Putting the unit together was relatively easy. Unfortunately, the holes for the brackets did not line up at all on the crossbars of my roof rack (the cross bars do not adjust).This will NOT work for 2012 Honda Odyssey EXL. Even if it did, after seeing how thin the material is on the inside that rubs against the bottom frame, I would be concerned that it would wear through with just a few uses."
3,Rola Roof Top Carrier,"We were not very pleased with this product. While it did afford us the ability to access the unit from the sides which is very helpful in loading and unloading, there were difficulties in attaching the unit to my car. We had to struggle to match the clamps to the cross bars; it does not appear to have an adequate opening in the carrier to facilitate this function.The most objectionable experience with this unit was the assembly instructions which were not very clear. There were additional parts (battens) that were sent that I'm still not sure how they are incorporated into this carrier. I called the 800 line provided and spoke to a technician who also did not know how they were used or needed.There are two clasps that are attached to bottom of the unit, approximately mid way on the carrier that do not seem to have any purpose other than to provide an annoying slapping noise against the roof of my vehicle. We had to tape them to the carrier handles."
3,Beautiful illustrations but this book needs editing,"I ordered this book with the plan to give it to one of my neices after reading it to determine the appropriate age level - one neice is 8 and one is 5. The book begins in a confusing way - it opens with ""Nick"" (who I assumed was a boy) waking to hear a sound on his roof, then skips to ""It all began years ago"" then skips back to the present. This method of storytelling is fine in an adult book, but it confused me in a children's book. I think children are better served by simple chronologies. Also, it turns out that Nick is an adult but you aren't clued in to that when he is first introduced. I think a lot of the phrases/words should have been worded more simply - for example: ""novel experience,"" ""on cue,"" ""sunlight filtered through,"" ""camouflage.""Given the level of vocabularly, I'll give the book to my eight year old neice and ask my sister to let me know what my neice thinks about it."
5,"The Singer Songwriter's Reference, A Must Have","As I have always been attracted to Leonard Cohen's mysterious poem and song writing; now I can and you too, experience the thrill of playing guitar or piano to Leonard's classic songs such as, Sister's of Mercy, Suzanne, Hey That's No Way to Say Goodbye, etc. We can do justice to these compositions since chord charts are provided making each page in this anthology easy to read with melodies - accurately -chord matched. In other words, it's not a fake book. Lyrics, though not text underlayed, can be manipulated under first verses, especially if you are a guitar player and are not in need of the piano treble and bass systems. Regardless, you won't be let down. Make this Anthology of Mr. Cohen's life's work masterpieces part of your creative library. Ok, I've gotta go now, Bird on A Wire is hovering over my guitar."
3,Wood's Tea Review,"Saw this group (or a later version of it) in concert in the 1,000 Islands recently. They do a great live show that loses something in the studio. They have at least one live album that is better. This is not to say that this is not a worthwhile pickup. They do respectible covers of the Irish Descendants (Irish Rain), Garnet Rogers (Three Fishers) and their instrumentals are folksy and lively on this album."
2,It works well but is too small,The bamboo is nice and it works well but is far to small to use as your main cutting board. Spend more and get a larger one.
5,Brilliant!,We played this on holiday many years ago and searched the internet for years to try and get one. Finally tracked it down and had it shipped to my brother ( it was in the US) He took months to send it on to me because he had so much fun with it too! That's how good it is.
2,"Good Ideas, Bad Poetry","Schirado and Assenzo had the right idea of bringing children and parents together over a picture book about emotions and experience; however, they would have done better to stick to prose. The rhymes are so stilted they illicit winces from my husband and I. Illustrations and idea content is good, and does generate talk with our children."
4,You need it if you are going to read Vol II,"I purchased this book because my husband owns vol II and wanted to read vol I first. If you love epics, masonry, legends, and the like this is the book for you."
2,The legend of Arthur,"After reading this fine Penguin edition of 'The Death of Arthur', I understood why there was such a wealth of material for Monte Python to parody in their film 'The Holy Grail'. I found a lot of the action in Malory downright silly or stupid. To be fair, Malory did a superb job collating the various grail legends. As a modern publisher, Penguin has put together two nice volumes at a reasonable price. And yet, though the legends of Arthur and the holy grail do hold fascination for western Europe, to be candid, I found Le Morte d'Arthur a dull and unpleasureable reading experience. If you already love the legends or want to know more about them, buy the books. If not, there are plenty better things to read."
5,anne frank,when i was in high school i never had to read this book but i saw the movie and i know it was more to it than what i saw so i wanted to read the book and i enjoyed the book so....
3,Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl: The Definitive Edition audio,I was disappointed when I got it since it was not the version of the book that I thought it was going to be.
4,This book was dope,"Anne Frank's family were ordinary people except for one thing, they were Jewish. That didn't matter, being Jewish, at least it doesn't know, but it did during the Holocoust. Being Jewish during the Holocoust ment that you were basically less than the a dog. If you were Jewish, like Anne Frank, you had to go into hiding. Anne Frank had to hide with her family and the Van. Dann's another family in a cramped attic. Her olny true friend is a diary the she writes in. She writes her deepest thoughts, dreams, and feelings. While in hiding she falls in love with the son of the other family staying with them. Sixteen year old Peter keeps her company and helps her live through the hard times of the Holocaust. Anne was a great person and didn't diserve the life she lived. This diary was one of a kind."
2,Boring,"This book was flat out boring and the only good part was when you found out that [...] and had some attraction for her friends. But other than that, it's boring. Not that I had to force myself to finish it, but it just wasn't interesting and her life is boring just like all of ours."
5,I loved this book!!,"I loved this book, and it is very hard to find a book that I like. This book is probably my favorite book so far, and I am only twelve. I usually like mysteries, but I guess that I like journals too. Also, this book inspired me to write a journal and just wish that it would be as famous as hers. And Anne's dream was to be famous. Now, she is."
4,A Brave Young Girl,"An insightful look back in history. ""Anne Frank, The Diary of a Young Girl"" is an almost fitting memorial to the young Jewish teenager who died at Bergen-Belson. Born in 1929 just before Anne Franks birthday she received a blank diary to write in. These entries are jaw dropping. This book is for everyone. It is a chance for people to read what the Holocaust was actually like, and the pain and injustice that occurred, and still occurs in the world today. It gives people a look on what type of horror is still going on in different parts of the world right now, and is more of an eye opener then anything. This book delivers a message, one we can all relate to. That ordinary people just like us are suffering. And for what reason? These people are not criminals. They are good people, smart people, and friendy people."
3,OK,Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl is an Autobiography of a young girl who tells of the time during the Holocaust. Anne writes in a diary that she calls Kitty. She tells of all the encounters she faces during the time she hides from the Nazis. They must be quiet while in their secret annexe to remain hidden. I enjoyed that this was a true story but I thought it was long and tedious. I think people who like history would enjoy this book. I do not think young children would have the patience to read this book. I thought this book was OK.
4,A classic!,"A classic that we all should read when we are young, and again when we are older. It emphasizes the fact that evil does exist in our world, and that evil often comes from a government. It belongs in all of our libraries."
2,words of wisdom,This book is not by far the best i have read. It is all about how the adults yell at her and she does not like being quiet all the time. This book is pretty dull most of the way through . Some parts would get exciting right at the time i was about to give up on reading it. This book is really great for people who like reading life stories but not for the adventerous type.
3,I thought it was good in some parts,"I thought the content of the book was good, but there is not alot about what is happening in the war in her diary. There are good parts but there are also parts that are detailed, too boring. Like the parts when she starts talking about peter, or how much she hates her mother. Only about 10% of this book is about the war. It is mostly about her personal problems. I would recommend this book to someone with a large attention span or if you only read a little bit at a time. Otherwise you will find yourself throwing the book out the window."
2,**A gOoD bOoK iN a BoRiNg WaY**,"I have read Anne Franks diary many times, although its a sad story, it is quite boring. Its about a young girl who writes in her journal and is stuck in an attic because of the war. The book does not decribe anything about the war which makes it boring and you hear how she loved Peter, and the same food she ate day after day.Its a good book in way that a young girl grows up in a 2-year period in an atiic and is more mature than her older roommate Peter. A good book that I recommend about the Holocaust is ""Night"" by Eli Wiesel."
3,story?,This was a diary with information to open eyes to effects of Nazis on innocent families. It had an inspiring thought to live on.
1,This Book was awful,This book was so boring i had to read it for school and i though it would be ok because i like learning about WW2 and the Holocaust but this book was just about Anne Frank's life which was like mine boring she rarely wrote about politics or about the war.
4,It is sad but true,"I know the story is true and that is why I am forcing nyself to read it, but to tell you the truth the book is boring."
3,School Assignment,My daughter was going to visit the Holecaust Museum and she was suppose to write about someone who went through the terror of the war and I felt that it would be a good idea if she read the Diary of Anne Frank.
1,Garmin support for GPS 60,"I purchased two of these units the first one worked OK. The second one has a problem. In a side by side comparison the signal qualities of the two units vary. I checked there accuracy and tracking with OziExplorer moving map software. The first unit tracks pretty good, but the second units position is off a large percentage of the time and sometimes as much as 400 meters. I sent the faulty unit to Garmin to be repaired. They sent it back with a description of the problem and that it had been fixed. I checked the unit out and it is the same as when I sent it to them. Now I'm stuck with a dud."
5,Keep Them Safe,"State laws vary, but the reality doesn't. Many children who are too old and too large to be in ordinary safety seats are still too short to use a shoulder belt alone since the belt cuts across them too high and poses a safety risk. This seat, which is inexpensive, very portable and easy to use, effectively lifts them up and keeps them safe. As a bonus, it makes it easier for them to see out the windows, making a ride in the car more enjoyable."
2,Great while it lasted...,"I had a Denon receiver that lasted 15 years with which I was very happy. That Denon saw a lot of use. When that gave out, I bought this one. It has the same beautiful, clear sound. Then one day, after 2.5 years of minimal use, it went dead, just like that. I could not believe it. Have they hired the wrong people? They are riding on the reputation of their old products because these new ones are definitely not worth the money. If you are thinking of buying a Denon, I strongly urge you to think again."
3,Longevity????,"Worked great until 2 years after purchase, then .... POW!!! No more receiver. Nice while it lasted but too expensive to buy every couple of years. My pioneer receiver is over 15 years old and still works in my den this DENON was a cool new replacement until it quit working today."
2,Nursing for Dummies,"This the ""People Magazine"" of the nursing world. The title itself is somewhat scary. This is not a scholary journal and isn't indexed by the National Library of Medicine. While a quick read, I would not consider this magazine to be part of a core library collection."
5,Not having a chest strap is the best part,"I have to say I disagree with ""Habeck"" regarding this product. Although I have a slightly different model than this one, the best part about mio is the heart rate monitor because I don't need a chest strap. All I had to do was take it out of the box, put my fingers to its face (there are two sensor buttons there) and bang... there's my heart rate.I may not be a runner like my fellow reviewer, but it's perfect for my needs (I wear it to the gym and on daily walks).I say... good work, mio!"
1,frustration,i have been using ryobi for two years. Everything was great until all of my attachements got stollen. i purchased the ss725r and found out it is nothing but a waste of money. the brush cutter attachement does not work on it and it spins in the reverse of my old straight shaft making very hard to control.
1,rip off . walmart hast this same box for 2.25 a box,"please don't get this on amazon, for you will just be throwing your money away. It is a big difference in price. do the math. Do yourself a favor and Get it at walmart"
2,Wanting...,"What a relief it is for us Rasha fans to hear her voice again on a new album after the stellar success of Sudaniyat! Let Me Be, however is not in that league. A plethora of musical mixes, sometimes mismatched but enchantingly fine tuned by Patxi Pascual (the saxophonist from Azar Alhai in Sudainyat), Let Me Be lacks the traditional richness of Sudaniyat. With lyrics full of longing and indifference, all passionately melancholy Rasha's soulful voice singing in 3 languages is a real treat. Let's hope that Rasha will get back to the drawing board and devise another work of genius and beauty similar to Sudaniyat."
3,"Not in the class of ""Shi"" by Alfred Sung, this one is floral, sweet but does not linger","I bought Paradise because I liked Shi by Alfred Sung which is a refined, light floral scent. However, Paradise is not in the same class. This one is sweet, floral and fruity, but it does not have the refinement of DKNY Be Delicious. Be Delicious is also floral, fruity but utterly ""delectable"", makes you want to ""bite"" into the perfume. Paradise is more like the cheap teenager version of a sweet fragrance ...it does not linger and almost disappears during the dry down process."
4,Solid Album,"This is a nice album from Aretha's early career. It includes two hit singles including the title track and ""Don't Play That Song"". This album also contains quite a few songs that she wrote herself, 5 in total. Some interesting cover choices from Jimmy Reed to B.B. King, also a great cover of ""Oh No Not My Baby"". Her voice is in top form. Overall a great R&B soul album from the Queen!"
3,Cord,"The cord is sturdy and nice. I have had mine for almost a year now and it is not tarnished at all. Which is wonderful because I shower in it and all. However, after wearing it for a long period of time the cord starts to bend and curve, it isnt always comfortable."
5,Impressed,I bought this truck for my friends son. It is so detailed. This is the perfect item if you are looking for some collector toys. Thanks no limit
5,An Excellent Source,Walker's shows you how to work up a price and customize your bids. It takes some computation of your own (you definitely have to know your local labor costs) but it's definitely worth the effort because Walker's explains how jobs wind up costing a certain amount. A great book for sure.
3,unrealistic cost codes for union contractors,very detailed reference but productivity rates are too high for proper estimating
2,"Nice pictures, but","Nothing else! For a decorating book you would assume it would have more to tell you how to decorate, but it's very simply a few scanty pictures, and little else. There are much better books out there, and this is disappointing seeing that it comes from better homes and gardens."
5,Great Source of Information,"This book is very helpful in understanding all the details for the Rebel 2000. If you want to move beyond simple point and shoot use, you will want to read this book. Like all the books in the Magic Lantern series this book has valuable information for all levels of photographers."
4,Be Surprised with the information,"I never wanted to get it, someone gave it to me and while the manual was with someone else I had to read up this book to find some information and along the way browse it.Surprise surprise! there's information on how the auto pic modes actually work (technically) and how the creative zones modes differ. I have no way to test out the theories behind these modes but if it can be published it must be accurate and correct. Another nice addition is info on all current EF lenses and some flash info on 550EX, you can easily find them on the internet but bedside readers like me would very much prefer to read on real paper stock.If you think you need it, get it. You won't lose anything for not getting it but any additional info will certainly made you look at the amazing Canon technologies from another point of view. Surprisingly the Nikon guides are more comprehensive and hence, more value for money."
3,Incomplete!!!,"Where are the answers to the exercises??? For a novice, the material seems to be what is needed, BUT there's no way to tell for sure if the lessons are being finished correctly. An answer key would be VERY helpful!"
2,berklee,"this is too simple a book for me. Wish I could have ""looked inside"" the book at several different pages before I purchased it. Sometimes they offer this feature and sometimes not. It does cover all the basics, just not as advanced as I had hoped."
4,A very good first book...,"I read this book in one sitting. Not because I had the extra time, but because I had to find out what happened to the hero....The title is enough to intrigue, but the author also delivers a very good Japanese bumpkin-comes-to-town-and comes-of-age story, complete with interesting characters, vivid flashbacks and compelling plot lines.Again, I wish that sexual abuse weren't so crucial to modern stories. I wish that particular kind of evil didn't exist, but, since it does, authors seem to be honing right in on it as the source of all of society's ills.I will read other stories by this fresh, new voice. He's got a handle on modern city life and he seems to know the pysches of those who live there."
4,An insider's view of the cultural tug-of-war that is Japan.,"In turns, wittily perceptive and poignantly moving, Audrey Hepburn's Neck gives a rare insider's glance not only at modern day Japan, but also at the myriad cross-cultural influences at work, tearing at the fabric of traditional Japanese custom, values and viewpoints. Mr Brown's writing is filled with bursting, impelling and yet graceful images- in short, accurately representaional of Japan, itself. Domo arigato, Burownu-san!"
4,Really good,"It has an interesting twist in that it is told in the voice of a young Japanese man (half Japanese as it turns out - but that's part of the family secrets not disclosed until late in the book) who is fascinated by American women, especially Audrey Hepburn, yet it is written by an American man. Set in Japan, it offers insight into not only Japanese culture but is like looking in a mirror at our own American culture. Besides the culture, setting, and dialog, which are crisp and well told, the story has a historical background and is rich and detailed and compelling."
5,Don't Dispair,"This CD is amazing... The musical is breathtaking.I just wanted to clarify that this CD is NOT out of production, but it is being quarantined by canada (where it is produced) for the time being, and until they free it, it cannot be sold, obviously. Just thought I'd let you know that If you have patience you can buy it for $20 from the Maui Myth and Magic Theatre... But nobody knows how long we will have to wait."
3,Don't kick it too hard!,"This album is what it is, and its certainly not BADFINGER! Recorded at a time when it was close to impossible to get any Badfinger tracks on disk (and the vinyl costs a mint - if you can find it!). Joey Molland released this rehash of the old masterpieces as a stopgap. Nobody can replace the Ham/Evans sound and that is what's at fault. If this had been called Joey Molland's Badfinger, then I think it would have been better recieved, but this is a completist's album, and should bee seen asa that. Dont kick it too hard!"
4,Pretty Good!,"Not a bad guitar bag, nice amount of space, great amount of padding, and my guitar doesn't bounce around a lot in the case. The only thing that I can think of that is bad about this product is that my guitar case only came with one backpack strap, I am not sure if it was supposed to or what, but I think that is the only gripe I have with it. Also the extra pocket has plenty of space too. Nice, cheap, durable, and great for its price. I highly recommend it."
5,Very Pleased.,My husband ordered this book for our Pastor. Our Pastor was delighted to get it. My husband has already read & approved the book. It is a wonderful autobiography about Bevington.
4,A small treasure.,"This is the story of God's influence in one good man's life. I say good, because he was attentive to God's influence. Set around 1925, in the mid-west (Ohio and Kentucky)."
5,Highly recommended for those who want to learn about how to pray.,"There has been no other book that has so profoundly impacted my prayer life other than the Bible as Remarkable Miracles by Guy Bevington. I first read it in 1975 and it revolutionized my prayer life. Guy Bevington discovered how to hear God in living color. Bevington learned that the greater part of prayer is in hearing what our Heavenly Father wants to say. I have given away dozens of this book to those who were hungering to know God in prayer.The testimony of Guy Bevington in Remarkable Miracles is proof that God is looking for a man, woman or child in and through whom He may show Himself strong."
4,Pound explained,"The bad-boy of the Paris avant-garde gets his definitive treatment in this fat biography by Humphrey Carpenter. Carpenter provides a literate and extremely detailed account of every period of Pound's long life, from his Idaho beginnings to his POW cage in Pisa to his shadowy senility in Venice. It's too bad this book is out of print, because I think it provides one of the best and most well-written portraits of Pound and the numerous friends and colleagues who derived benefit from his editing and patronage. Carpenter also provides balanced but critical discussion of Pound's unfortunate political leanings and their relation to his art. With some very good photos."
1,Not worth the price,I bought this snow thrower and used it once. The poorly designed plastic auger broke within the first hour of using it. I would not waste my money on this product. I would recommend buying a regular snow thrower.
3,Slow Patient Read,Explains different types of prayer and meditation from a Christian perspective. Encourages you to get in a quiet zone and cast about for God's voice.
5,"Relaxing and Folksy Music, Excellent!","This album features a combination of mountain dulcimer, mandolin and guitar work in a Celtic style. I love listening to it while programming. My favorites are ""Red Is The Rose - The Winter It is Past"", ""The Little Beggarman"", and ""The Blooming Meadows - Donnybrook Fair - Ryan's Favorite"". But really the entire album is great listening, especially if you like the sound of the mountain dulcimer featuring Jerry Rockwell, an internationally reknown folk musician."
5,holy moly. this sounds great!,"my old reciever Sony STR-DE875 sounded great to me. i bought it for 350 at circuit city in um 2003 i think.i never turned it off and last year the right channel got a lot weaker than the left. i lived with it for a year and last week i started hearing crackling when playing cds at full volume. so i used this excuse to buy a new reciever hehe.i frequently visit A/V science forum and always read about denon. so decided on this brand. next price. i only had like 500 to spend. oh and i needed a phono input and hdmi of course. i checked the denon site and decided on 887. got it from amzon for 599 shipped.ok ugh too much writing. well holy geezus when i heard this machine. cds, lps, sacd dvdas, dvds all sounded so freakin amazing. like plasmas have 3d picture will this had 3d sound.i am really impressed and can only imagine what the higher end models sound like. it cant get better can it?"
1,Total Garbage,"Total waste of money and complete garbage. Broke after one week. Sand got in the gears and it never moved properly again. Plus, the motion was always a little too complex for my 3 year old - he could never get it to release the way it is meant to and therefore never actually dig with it! I would certainly not recommend this toy. In fact, I will warn people about it."
3,A little disappointed....,"I was so excited to get this truck for my 27 month old son. He loves construction trucks and to dig-so it doesn't get any better than this truck, right?!Well first we had to wait a week and a half to get it. I do have to say that everytime I called amazon customer service they were very polite. The guy on the live chat signed out on me, even though I wasn't done with my conversation, apparently he was.So now we have the toy, but it has a locking mechanism to lock the scoop in the up position. You have to twist the handle to unlock it and drop the scoop. Its difficult to do and my little guy gets very frustrated with it. Its kind of an unnecessary feature. Otherwise its cute and seems durable.All in all the whole transaction was a little disappointing."
5,Unadorned and Unafraid,"This Pulitzer Prize winning collection of poetry is a document to the power diversity of the best African-American poet to come along in the post-modern (after WWII) period. Komunyakaa, who appeared this past fall as part of the Lenoir-Rhyne College Writers Series, is at his best when writing about jazz, his relationships with other family members and his Vietnam experience. The passages are often chilling and direct, unadorned yet filled with perfect word choices."
1,Not Happy,I did not receive the bra's I ordered.They came from a Bealls store in Florida. The only thing they got right was the size. The bra's were not even Warners brand name so I had to send them back.I won't order again.Debbie Bosley
4,Good meal replacer,"I get these for my teenage daughter who is a celiac and a vegetarian. She loves the taste and I feel like these bars are a pretty healthy snack and especially good for when she forgets to make a lunch. The taste is not for everyone, so you might want to try a single from your local store before committing to the box of fifteen!"
4,Warning the DVD is not a complete Season 15!!!!!!,"For the most part this is an excellent compilation of the Season 15 tests and antics.This video compilation leaves out the Ayrton Senna tribute, I think one of the best segments that Top Gear has ever produced. For all I can tell, there are no other omissions or additions. I am very disappointed that this was left out and still labeled the ""Complete Season 15"" without any other disclaimers. The extras that are included are not particularly interesting. I leave a star off for this reason."
2,Rating is for the studio,"There are 2 sorts of studios: Real studios who take a movie and make a real DVD; and others, like this one, who take a VHS of the movie, and, after some self-advertising, copy the tape onto DVD putting some chapters: so, 1st the image quality is not what you're expecting from a DVD, 2nd you don't have any options for languages/subtitles and you're stuck with subtitles you'd like to get rid of. This can be understood for low-budget editions, which should not be this price: Facets Video is now on my blacklist (although I must admit no one can do worse than Madacy)."
2,How and When to be your own doctor.,This is more personal philosophy than medical information. It is much different than the title implies. Don't waste your time.
4,Greatest?,"This doesn't strike me as a ""Greatest Hits"" exactly, but is a good studio collection for a great sale price. All in all, it has a nice mellow quality about it, but if you're looking for something with more ""adrenaline"", go for the live recordings of the ""Nine Tonight"" cd."
5,Great review of Seger's Work,This album is a great review Bob's work over the years. Every song shows a different side of his talent. Few artists can equal the bredth of his body of work. He is truly a master of the Rock genre.
2,CD review,"CD ""sticks"" at one place so that the listener has to skip the song to continue. Other than that, it's a great CD."
3,Too many missing songs,"There are only two reasons to buy a ""greatest hits"" package: 1) you aren't crazy enough about the artist to want to get deep into his/her catalog; 2) you want a nice car cd, ala Beatles' ""One."" This collection just doesn't get the job done. For example, where are ""Even Now"" and ""'Til It Shines?"" (There is a killer version of ""'Til It Shines"" on the Mumford soundtrack, BTW, Lyle Lovett and Billy Ocean, I think.) I was very disappointed when I bought this."
4,Bob Seger Greatest Hits CD,"I recieved this CD in a timely manner. It features such Seger classics as ""Turn The Page"", ""Night Moves"", ""Like A Rock"", as well as several others. I was disapointed it didn't offer ""Rock ""n"" Roll Never Forgets"". All in all it is a highly enjoyable CD."
4,Best of Seger,"With mainstay staples such as ""Night Moves"", ""Old Time Rock & Roll"", and ""Hollywood Nights"" this compilation of Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band makes it clear why he is a transcendental artist and rocker. Though not the hard rock type, Seger represents the best of late 70's rock interlaced with 50's rock undertones and rhythm. Adding this to a classic rock fan's catalogue is a great decision, and would be appreciated by many friends at parties for years to come."
4,Love Bob Seger!,In the early 80's this was my favorite album and I listened to it endlessly. Recently I realized I hadn't one song by Bob Seger in my extensive Ipod collextion and bought a used c.d. of his....and am still thrilled with Bob Seger's rocker voice :)
1,bad,"i was very disappointed when i got this cd. how can you have a greatest hits cd and leave off 4 top ten hits? including his only number one song? he left off fire lake, tryin' to live my life without you, shame on the moon, and shakedown(#1). plus he left off ramblin, gamblin man. i thought maybe he left these songs off because he didn't have enough room. this isn't the case. he had enough room to put 3 or 4 more songs on it! he probably left these songs off so you would have to go out and buy the other albums. good move bob."
1,Missing,"A Bob Seger Greatest Hits album without Ramblin' Gammblin' Man and Heavy Music, is no such thing. No 2 + 2? UMC? Persecution Smith. Lame. Missing the best songs.+ 2"
3,Missing in Action,"Admittedly, there's good stuff on here ... but I've always wondered how they could possibly release a Bob Seger ""greatest hits"" album without ""Ramblin' Gamblin' Man"" or ""Heavy Music""?"
5,help??,"Hi, I havent purchased the CD, bt I saw him on Comedy Central. What is the name of te song where he tells how his girlfriend and him are diffent and he likes his girlfrieds's sister. he says something like ""i wanna nail your sister/i wanna f* the s* out of your sister"" hahaha i thougt he was funny on TV.. So does anyone know the name of this song?"
5,Love It,"Stephen Lynch is by far one of the best, most hilarious comedic masters of all time. If you have ever laughed at anything, ever, in your entire life then you have got to have this CD."
5,The funniest CD I've ever heard,"I was first exposed to Stephen Lynch on a Comedy Central stand-up special, and he is one of the funniest comedians out there. This CD is awesome; I can think of only one song that didn't have me laughing myself to tears (and he admits in the beginning that it isn't funny). Lynch is a master at pushing the very limits of what is acceptable, and making it funny as hell. I would say, though, that this CD (especially the song ""For the Ladies"") is not for the prudes. Don't listen to it with your kids, and for God's sake, don't listen to it with your mom!"
4,Strange but Lovely,"I'd forgotten just how strange this fairytale is. But it's also beautiful to look at, well, besides the inside of the donkey skin and the woman speaking frogs. A bit shocking and bizarre for modern French students, but worth it anyway. That's half the fun right?"
3,This is not the movie soundtrack - it's Totoro-themed kid songs,"I thought this was the soundtrack but it's not. It's pop songs about the movie, all in Japanese."
2,Vaporous Boring Spittle,"I have had to use this text for a few years now in one version of the Technology & Society classes that I teach. Most of the students I've had who had to read this book hated it. They found it just as boring, if not more so, than I did. I'll say that, although Volti does present bits and pieces that should be covered in an introductory class on STS, overall not only is the book boring and tediously lethargic, Volti makes various presumptuous claims, logical and ethical contradictions, and demonstrates the metaphysics of language and capitalism throughout. Volti might tell you what there is, as he and many perceive it, but the text certainly falls short of any academic work of critical importance."
4,They lied,"The description specifically said, ""NO markings"" and there were highlights in the book. Not a huge deal, but specifically why I chose this book over another. Fast shipping, got what I paid 4."
4,"nice chain, but it is not 18""","This is a very pretty, well-made chain that can easily be paired with larger pendants, but it is about 1/2 inch shorter than most 18"" chains, so you may want to consider buying a slightly longer one."
3,Not at all like your Troll Doll,"It's difficult to convince people that they should read this book. Begin by mentioning that it is about a gay man who adopts a troll, add that it is pretty erotic and they begin to notice things about YOU that they had never quite seen before, but yes....now that you mention it....hmmm.This is a kinky fairytale or like a dream gone over the edge.The protagonist is not Angel, the handsome blonde photographer, but Pessi the troll whom we can't wait to read about, can't wait to see growing and thriving. It is Pessi who rivets us to the end, with his dark presence, his quick moves, his unpredictability, his shadowlike gtace. And it is that shadow quality that might explain the mysterious ending. Cuckoo, cuckoo."
3,'I've tried to capture part of the forest and now the forest has captured me',"When gay Mikael rescues a young troll from a gang of drunken yobs, he at once states:'It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.I know straight away that I want it.'In Sinisalo's novel, trolls are a rare but scientifically accepted species, and the very short chapters, narrated by different people who feature in the story (but not Pessi, the 'tamed' troll) are interspersed with literary and non-fiction references to the creatures.The situation of Pessi, kept penned up in a Helsinki flat by a stronger creature, is parallelled by Mikael's neighbour, a young Filipino mail-order bride, living a hellish existence with her brute of a husband. She too gets sucked in to the troll story...A very unusual and intriguing read."
5,Three Years and Still Going Strong!,I have had this camera for three years. I love it! When I lived in Colorado I dropped it about 20 ft down the side of mtn and it was scratched but still worked perfect. I haven't had any problems. I use recharageable batteries.
5,Thirteen Gun Salute,"Patrick O'Brian is un-matchable when it comes to historical novels on the British Navy & sailing ships during the early 1800's. With help using ""Dean King's"" two books, ""A Sea of Words"", and ""Harbors and High Seas"", the twenty ""Master and Commander"" series of novels by Patrick O'Brian can be read over many times, and each time will give you aditional pleasure & insight into the days of ""Wooden Ships & Iron Men""! (An ex- Merchant Seaman)"
3,Maturin/Aubrey - Patrick O'Brian Series,"Good series. Start with first book or it won't be as interesting. The series has some of the same elements, but are limited compared with the books, and put together quite differently. The author's style takes some getting use to. He uses phrases that sometimes require interpertation (foreign language, french, latin and others)which you learn to skip. Kind of skips through actions. More about the doctor than the captin. Like C.S. Forester better."
3,"Stuff's review for ""The Double Life of Pocahontas""","The Double Life of Pocahontas is an exciting, factual book about a young Indian woman and the settlers that invade her fathe's kingdom. As the story progresses it tells how the settlers and the Indians friendship evolve. This book written by the well known author Jean Fritz and is recamended for all ages."
5,Still sparkles 15 years later,"From where we sit in 2010, it's hard to believe that Everclear were at one point a phenomenal rock band, but the evidence is right here in front of you. Sparkle and Fade was their apex, a time when Art Alexakis was arguably one of the best lyricists putting pen to paper. He was more intelligible than Kurt Cobain and less generic than, well, pretty much everyone else; delivering tales of drug addiction, fame, and the general downsides of life and love. Although these songs are emotionally charged, don't expect any of the saccharin radio pop that Everclear put out in later years. All you'll find here is a hard driving punk-meets-pop sound delivered with true heart. Although there isn't a skippable track on the album, ""Heartspark Dollarsign"" is probably one of the best songs of the last 20 years. While their next album, So Much For the Afterglow, is listenable, it was all downhill from here."
4,Really good cd,"Pretty good CD. I especially like ""santa monica"" and ""heartspark dollarsign"". About 3 or 4 songs on the CD kinda suck, the rest of the cd is pretty damn good. I would recommend it to people who like their rock not as heavy as metallica or megadeth."
4,"everclears album is listenable, and good all throughout.","this is a good album. the whole thing. i value that quite a bit over 1 great song and boring album. bunch of great songs too.. ""Heroin Girl"" kicks, and so does ""You Make Me Feel Like A Whore"""
4,"Punk, grunge, whatever it may be...","I was going to go out an buy Everclears album ""So Much for the Afterglow"" but decided against, to pick up their much heavier sounding, faster paced ""Sparkle and Fade."" After many years of hearing ""Santa Monica"" on the local rock station, and them not telling me Everclear was the artist, I finally discovered this album. Santa Monica is a great song, but as are the first 4 songs. You get pounded with fast punk, and whatnot for the first 15 minutes, then it seems to fade into much of the same, repeating over again.So for you who think Everclear is only for teenyboppers, go pick this one up, and think different."
5,not much help,"this isn't much help to you, but this cd is really good. click on the music links before you buy it though, lot of people I know don't like it."
2,Not Everclear's best...,"I am a bigtime Everclear fan, and I enjoy most of their music, but I fail to see why most of their fans rate ""Sparkle and Fade"" as their best album. Sure ""Santa Monica"" and ""Summerland"" are good, but the other songs are all mediocre at best. I can't quite explain it, but the ""feel"" of this album just isn't right. I think Everclear truly hit their stride with ""So Much for the Afterglow"" and kept getting better from there. I highly recommend all their CD's, except this one."
5,Another hit,"I watched this workout before attempting it, but it wasn't until I did the DVD that I felt, ""hey, I can do this"". It is a perfect complement to Beauty Body, and Dance the Chakras. Neither of them make me sore any longer, but I still get a bit of a challenge.Of course the music, Ana's presence and direction, and Ravi's direction and verbal skills are golden. So is the production value. Golden.I have all but one of their DVD's. Ravi and Ana are the same amazing teachers every time, though the production value gets better and better.I am hooked."
5,A Genius Workout,"The subtitle for this DVD is Hip Opening & Mood Mastery.I think it's genius that the authors put those two concepts together. It's sort of like the peanut butter and jelly of yoga! This one starts with a good amount of lower body work, but it's not prohibitive at all. I was able to do just about everything and it really opened me up. The second half of this DVD entails abdominal and upper body work. This is a more than skin deep approach which gets into some deep places for active releasing and mental and emotional breakthroughs. The results from this are really worth the investment of time and effort. I can't say enough good things about this DVD!"
2,Not for me,"I have a hip injury and was looking for a video specifically designed to work that area. Unfortunately, this video ended up not being right for me. The ""breath of fire"" made me feel more like I was having a seizure and less like I was getting a good stretch."
1,"You can have my copy, for free!","I just personally don't like this approach to yoga with the the chanting and panting exercises. I'd rather do the physical exercises...I didn't even make it through this whole DVD, I had to turn it off."
1,Weirdest workout ever,"I love yoga but this was not at all what I was expecting. I have a hip injury and was excited to try this workout to help me release tight hip flexors and aid in recovery. What I got was the feeling that I'd suddenly walked in on a cult. The breath of fire makes you feel like you're hyperventilating. The quick, jerky movements made me feel like I was flailing around and was likely to injure myself by pulling a muscle or two. There were some movements that I think would benefit my tight hips, but you'll have to wade through a whole lot of craziness to get to them. I would not recommend this DVD if you're looking for a non-religious ordinary workout."
5,Yoga Bliss Hips,"I reckon these two created a fabulous symbiosis! His voice guides you beautifully through all the moves and if you are not too sure you can see Ana showing you the asanas. I love their Kundalini Yoga, because it allows you your own pace, accommodates for your level ( I practiced Iyingar and Astanga Yoga for 9 years intensively- was a normal 38 year old when I started..) and leaves you with a feeling that you did something really beautiful, healthy and nourishing.. They are WONDERFUL!"
4,Intelligent and poetic book about dystonia,I really enjoyed this book ... He speaks poetically about the experience of a person living with dystonia. It's worth reading this book.
2,Stefplans,"I thought this would be a more helpful book than the APA Publication Manual, but I was wrong. This small volume does not cover enough items that I need to write a graduate level paper. I suggest purchasing only the Publication Manual."
2,Concise was too concise,This is probably a useful book for someone who is familiar with APA style. For someone loke myself who had no knowledge of the style rules it was of little use. I'd suggest buying the full version of APA style rules if you're just learning the format.
1,An Absolute Waste Of Time,To even remotely compare this book to Caleb Carr's 'The Alienist' is to do Mr. Carr a grave disservice. It is a complete waste of time.
3,"Sloooow start, too long, good NYC detail, not a success","This novel is getting big hype so I picked it up hoping for a good read. But, it's an arduous plod in the first 150 pages before the plot eventually snares the reader. Lots of fascinating 1890's NYC detail which is why I stayed with the novel up to the too-postponed end. Especially as the putative mystery thriller it is touted as, this book has many plot problems. In a mystery, the plot doesn't have to be realistic but it does have to be convincing and this one is not. There are at least three major plot disconnects for which there is nothing in recompense."
1,Major Disappointment,"I just bought this last month and needed to use it today, I wanted a sturdy step and I trusted the Cosco brand. I have several other Cosco products.This product is sturdy and strongly built but very poorly ergonomically designed. The first step does not project past the second step sufficiently so that the first step ( which is very much smaller than the top step) has an extremely small footprint. It is not only awkward but the top step painfully contacts your shins. This product does not meet any normal stair step guidelines and must have been designed by someone that doesn't really need such a device and normally uses something like a turned over bucket."
4,A great read,"NOTE: This review is for the 1996 release.I stayed up well into the morning hours reading this book for the second time. Leavened with plenty of sardonic wit, it lets you know the difference between ""real"" and ""reel"" justice in terms non-lawyers can understand. God bless."
1,Does not work with Window Vista,"This product does not come with a driver for Windows Vista, and it does not work with Windows Vista. The company does not offer a Vista driver on its website either. Don't buy it if you use Vista!"
4,Use Parallel Printer HP LaserJet III with Vista Laptop,"Works great to run my HP LaserJet III printer from my Windows Vista laptop computer. Haven't tried with any other printers, yet."
2,Works well,Works well. The only problem I had was the cable was defective. The cable was coiled in the box and two of the cables were fused. I pulled them apart and it tore and I did not want to go through the hassel of returning so I just applied black tape and it works well.
5,Works like a Charm,"Installed one of these to support an HP Desk Jet series. No need for extra drivers, etc...It performed, and isstill performing like a true champion!"
1,useless cable and support,"False advertising. States fully compliant with USB 1.1/2.0, but does not have USB compliant symbol on the cable. You can not see that until you open the package, but once opened you can not return it.States fully compliant with IEEE 1284. Support person keeps telling me to look for a COM port, not LPT port, he did not seem to know the difference. Keeps telling me to contact the computer manufacturer.Parallel device can not see it, so can not use it. Waste of $$$"
1,Did not work,"I purchased the USB to parallel cable because my new computer did not have a parallel cable input and thought I could save the cost of a new printer. However, the cable did not work and I wasred a lot of time trying to find a driver that would make it work. So in the end I bought a new printer for $99."
1,It didn't work on Windows 7 Dell XPS,"I had hopes it would save me a few bucks, rather than buying and installing a PCI parallel printer port. Tried to use it with a HP Laserjet 6MP but no luck. Windows 7 seemed to recognize that a new device was added but could not ""find"" it. The included mini-cd was no help.Should have just bitten the bullet and spent $25 for the PCI card solution."
5,Works Great!,The cable works as promised and is plenty long to reach from the desktop CPU on the floor through an access hole at the rear of the desk to the old HP LaserJet. The installation was seamless.
1,"Great idea, but doesn't work with Epson printer","Great idea, but it doesn't work to connect my brand new Thinkpad and my Epson Stylus 740. The documentation is useless - a vague attempt at English. The cable was too cheap to spend the money to return, but I'm not a happy customer."
5,Mac to HP LaserJet 1100,"I use this cable to connect my Mac to an old HP LaserJet 1100 provided by my employer. The LaserJet 1100 has an uncommon printer cable connector on the printer end, so a USB-to-parallel male cable is not an option. This Sabrent USB-to-parallel female cable connects to the end of the printer cable that I previously connected to my dilapidated old PC's parallel port. When I plugged it into my Mac, which runs an updated copy of Mac OS 10.6 ""Snow Leopard,"" it was automatically recognized and the driver selected. Using this cable was a completely painless process for me from start to finish and I couldn't be happier."
1,"Poor quality, non-functional","I purchased this cable thinking all cables were created equal, and why shell out $40 for a brand-name version, when I could buy this one for a mere $9? Well, I've learned my lesson! The cable arrived in new packaging, but when opened I found the plastic sheathing over the cable proper had melted so that it stuck to itself and the twist ties were embedded into the cable surface. A little wrestling freed the cable but when plugged into my Brother HL8020 and connected to my Vista Home Premium PC, I repeatedly got ""USB Device not recognized"" error messages. Clearly the issue was not with drivers (I tried both the native Vista driver and two provided by Brother), but with the cable itself. $$$$ and one high-quality Belkin cable later, my printer 'plug-n-played' on the first try. So - learn from my mistake: you get what you pay for, and with this cable, that means not much more than headaches and wasted time!"
2,Works Great on Some but Not All,"I bought this cable with the hope that it would work with my Zebra Label printer. The product says that is works with all Parallel printers, well it doesn't. The only reason it didn't get a 1 star was because it does work with my HP Laserjet printer and it at least detected the Zebra label printer.. it just wouldn't print to it.I tried different USB ports, trying printing directly to the printer, switched to non-bidirectional support. Nothing seemed to work."
1,Get What you Paid for,I purchased a new notebook which did not have a parallel ports and needed to use a USB adapter. I spent 3 days trying to install and uninstall printer sometime would find port most time not. I stopped buy Staples (while on my route use this notebook and printer for service route I own) purchased a Belkin cable for $52.99 hooked it up recognized printer immediately has not failed since.
1,Did I Miss Something?,"Hmmm...I think I missed a whole lot of somethings. This is a dreadful novel. I'll admit, I picked it up because the movie is currently in theaters. I should have known better. A review of the movie...""...convoluted plot, ambiguous characters, confusing..."" should have scared me off. Each time I picked it up, I had to re-read a few pages, to figure out who was who and what was or wasn't happening.I tried to finish this book...honest...but, all too soon, it got tossed in the ""drop off at the club"" pile. I never even took the time to read the last few chapters to see what happened. Why? Because I had no urge to know.Will I watch the movie? Well, maybe, because I like the actors...but, only once it's offered, free, on ""On Demand."" I've spent enough money on this overly-hyped, drivel of a story!"
1,Scott Turow for the louche set,"Ellroy is one of the most overrated authors of recent years.I have no problem with people liking swill, they usually do, but people with otherwise good taste seem to LOVE this pretentious twaddler.Ellroy writes plot-dependant novels, but can't plot to save his damn life. Halfway through every one of his books, the plot breaks down, and, not that I read for plot, there's nothing else left. Save yourself time and read a good Ed McBain, Elmore Leonard, or, go to the source, Dash Hammett."
1,Black Dahlia,"This is undoubtedly one of the worst books that I have ever read. Maybe I just don't like the genre, but I found the book to be convoluted and boring. I even tried to watch the movie, thinking that I just needed a boost. WRONG! It was awful too!"
4,"Not an easy read, but worth it","This novel was difficult for me to get into. The noir speak of the book presented itself as a barrier to entry. After training myself to think in terms of the language, I found myself so engrossed in the story that I moved through it at a steady pace. Definitely a darker novel but the character development was outstanding."
2,Didn't finish it.,It didn't hold me.....but I might try it again......the book club were mixed - some of them like it and some of them like myself - didn't finish it.
2,High Intrigue--High Improbability,"I can't deny the suspense, and how hard the book was to put down--for the first half because the main character has a likeable intelligence. Not having read any of Ellroy's other books, I was taken by his ability to capture 1940s vernacular and style, in the beginning. The plot becomes so convoluted and drawn out that the reader pulls away from it thinking ""well, this started out entertaining, but c'mon now."" As the plot develops the prose begins to lose its 40s edge and becomes very 90s with tons of phrases and jargon that likely didn't exist in that era. I did enjoy the police sensibility which seemed authentic to the time. The obsessiveness of the main character becomes tedious and as the story rolls along becoming more unbelievable page by page, you are left with gratuitous violence that is more shock value than substance. The book is gruesome and silly at the same time."
3,"""Conan the Barbarian"" on Mars","Essentially a better budgeted ""Conan the Barbarian"" set in Martian territory. Goldsmith manages to turn in action cue after action cue, occasionally pausing long enough to be surprisingly mushy (or spaced-out). It is often entertaining, the action cues are uniformly top-notch, several bits of musical humor prevent irredeemable overkill, but the music is just as frequently over-synthesized and overly derivative."
2,Over my head - and I'm pretty tall!,"So there were lots of great parts of this book, and lots of relevant historical information, and, at times, it really shines. How paved streets came about in London, for example, the Macaroni fashions, and other important historical phenomena are covered and are covered pretty well. However, the book does not read well at all. You will find yourself reading and re-reading and re-reading again. Good information, but not very digestable, and the conclusion needs work, as it's difficult to see the relations of all of the ""spaces."""
5,Terrific,As an avid Michael Connelly reader I really like his books and this one is great. Go no further than Amazon for the latest books at the best prices.
4,Maverick cop pursues old crime with bulldog tenancity,"Real page turner for people into this genre. Another insight into the LA police dept.'s troubled past. Harry Bosch is LA cop tough, but also is shrewed, analytical and flawed."
2,Not up to par with his other works,"I am a Michael Connely fan and have read many of his Bosch novels, but I found the plot of the Last Coyote very contrived.The author wanted to put in the surprise at the ending, but ended up losing all credibility in the story."
4,Chung King is Funky Holiday music,"I have heard some of these songs on the radio during the holidays but it was hard to find since it has been out of print from 1991. The songs sound like an Asian marching band playing Christmas songs using instruments you would normally associate with Asian music or as noted on the cover ""...with an Oriental Flavor"". Although not every song is a winner and the CD sent has some skips, I'm happy with this purchase. It's fun to listen to."
3,It's not what you think,"First off the video included never shows you any indoor exercises. All they show you how to do are jungle gym stuff. You have to improvise to use this on a door, oh and make sure the door is strong. You should only use it on front doors not indoor doors like a door to your room or something. doing pull ups is uncomfortable. Overall I think you'd benefit more from a standalone pull up rack."
2,High hopes for a little light,"I gave this as a gift and she told me that she could never get the lamp shade to stay on the bulb. It's one of those wire circle that attach directly to the bulb. You have to be very careful choosing a lamp on line, be sure to use a ruler or tape measure to help you understand how tall the lamp you are buying stands. Deceilving BUT very inexpensive, almost a case of you get what you pay for"
5,Music that fills the house with life!,"This musical CD makes it difficult to stay still. It is an interesting combination of music styles that brings back memories of Klezmer updated with a driving, exciting modern beat. This is my second Balkan Beat Box CD, and I really enjoy the liveliness and quality of their music, as well as the middle eastern and Israeli flavor of their passionate sound."
3,John Lennon's story,"Okay movie about john Lennon...accurate, but as in true English style, slow and plodding...definitely, not exciting and very little Beatles music....more like a documentary."
1,This book stinketh to high heaven,This book is so bad its funny. I don't understand how it got published.
4,Everglades History and Biography,"I highly recommend this interesting book. The details about Florida history are fascinating as Ogden presents some terrific stories told by Simmons. There is rich information about alligator hunting, bootlegging, and boat building. I am especially interested in Simmons' boats as the type of skiff that he makes is characteristic, if not unique, to the 'glades.This portrait of Florida is vivid and harsh, and the book provides a richer, more nuanced, view of the state than most imagine."
1,Tastes bad,This tastes like metal or rubber or plastic to me. Very bad unnatural aftertaste. I'll be trying something different. Very disappointed after so many people said it tastes good. Maybe you need to blend it with a thousand things to overcome the aftertaste?
3,Best tasting but...,"I agree with many of the high starred reviews in that Jay Robb's whey protein drinks taste great. I also love that it is low carb. My only complaint is that when I opened my large, 23 dollar container...it was only half full. It was very misleading."
1,bad product,"way overpriced, the gold standard or ON by optimum nutrition is a great deal, but this Jay Robb protein doesn't work, i didn't even use it,"
3,THESE ARE NOT THE SONGS ON THIS CD/EP,"These songs are found on the ""Monkey Gone to Heaven"" EP. I'd like to know the track listings for this one."
4,Very Interesting,"Very interesting ""Macbeth"" is an interesting play about a man who gets the taste of power and cannot stop getting as much of it as possible. I found it well done how very clearly the difference between good and bad is showed, as it probably was at that time. The brave knights that fight for their country and against the tyranny of an usurper. But we must not forget that Macbeth has once been one of them. So we know that perhaps the same could happen to one of thes brave knights."
2,Too hard for me to understand,"** Too hard for us to understand The story may be interesting, if you really like to get some information about this time, how people lived and thought, and their moral. The plot is interesting, but there are too many monologes, which make the story dry. Overall, the language is quite hard to understand, if your mother language isn't English. But for a better understanding, there is the marvellous possibility of watching the movie or the play performed in a theatre. Don't miss it!"
1,BAD EDITION,"I am giving the Dover Thrift Edition 1 star, not the play, the play is a world classic and a masterpiece. The edition, however, is pitiful. I would like to know how many people were lured into buying this because it is so cheap?This would not do for any kind of performance because it provides very little, if any, notes as to what is going on in the background, what the actors should be doing, how they are feeling, details at all! It is simply a horrible edition for anything but putting on your bookshelf to rot. Unless you never plan on reading this book, don't buy it. PLEASE!"
4,"Good, but...","I really like this series, but I have to nit-pick a little. Lady Macbeth sounds way too young, and the Scottish accents seem fake. Other than that, it's a good performance of a great play."
5,Good price on replacement part,I was simply looking for a replacement blade for our juicer. I'm so happy I found one here for a good price!
3,GRRRRRRRRR,"Where's ""Burning Down One Side"" and ""In The Mood""? How hard can it be? Idiots! I feel sick!"
2,Plant loves the carpenter song???,"I will just say, buy his solo cds. Theres no reason for this. First off robert plant loves for some strange reason the song he remade if i were a carpenter. He put that on this disc, he acts as though its his own song. Hes performed it live over songs like i belive. He really needs to stop with this song. And 5 tracks from fate of nations???? He could have at least put far post, hurting kind, and in the mood. and the second disc could have been some good Bsides and live stuff. THis guy did too much drugs in the seventies, and his face defintley shows it.."
2,Stinko Hits Collection,"A lousy greatest hits collection. The producer should have concentrated on his popular solo work. There is so much missing from his great albums of Pictures at Eleven (Pledge Pin, Burning Down One Side, Worse Than Detroit, Moonlight In Samosa & Like I've Never Been Gone)from Now & Zen (Ship Of Fools, Hurting Kind & Dance On My Own) plus other great omitted songs, In The Mood, Sites & Sevens & a great overlooked song from the White Nights soundtrack, Far Post. They could've had a winner here for this long awaited anticipated CD."
2,Is this really the best of?,"A big, big dissapointment...most probably there will be another CD called: The greatest hits...almost nothing from pictures at eleven and principle of moments which are brilliant albums...such a pity...very odd and bizarre selection of songs...strange...looking forward to the real best of...this is just a waste of money..."
3,finally a plant best of.. but......................,"I have been waiting for a plant greatest hits, this ones rather werid.. 2 discs and no in the mood.. or wheres hurting kind.. ??nOW I AM glad its got tie dye on the highway as the first song which is a kick ass song, probley one of plants best.. This cd represents way much of fate of nations.. 5 songs.. what was he thinking.. The second cd blows, i wasnt intrested in anything on there, except the unreleased princple of moments song road to the sun. But the first cd could have been better. Thank god he put tie dye on here remastred no less."
5,recommended,Great product. Have been using it about a year now with no complaints at all. Lets me crack the windows when it's raining. Highly recommended.
2,A poor look at ethical wealth,"I was asked to contrast this book to Christopher Browning's _Ordinary Men_ for a class in Comparative Religious Ethics. While this proved to be an intresting exercise, Philip Hallie's unpolished tale of Le Chambon, a stop on France's ""Underground Railroad"" for WWII refugees, suffers in the comparison.Hallie makes tentative steps towards a biography of Andre Trocme (the town's pastor), a specific and narrow history of a French town in WWII, a case study in ethics, and a testimony of praise for people he grew to admire in his research. None of these directions arrive at any satisfying destination, leaving the narrative feeling disorganized and lacking the import the story might have held.In spite of the ways Hallie's approach disappointed me, I would still recommend this book to those people who enjoy reading simple modern morality tales told in terms of ""good vs. evil"", or those who want some rather saccharine optimism about human nature in their histories of WWII."
1,sent the wrong part twice,"I ordered the back up lights twice and both times recieved the wrong part.Summit racing apparently can't read part numbers on orders. Amazon has been exceptional in their help to get me a refund, but I still don't have the part I wanted."
5,"An absolutely amazing song from ""Bossanova""","This song should have been a #1 single. It's catchy, technically brilliant, and crafted with tons of imagination. Get the cd ""Bossanova"" as well. It's wonderful.The Pixies were the best."
5,My Son's New Favorite,"This one is surprising because it really did nothing for me. My mother gave it to my son, along with a lot of other Christmas books. However, he has gravitated to this one. The description says that it is for 4 to 6 year olds, but my son is only 2 1/2. We've read it about ten times, but he has it memorized. We can randomly ask him to state the next word and he always gets it. Every night he asks for the tamale book."
5,Quality Set,"I bought these because I thought ""no questions return guarantee and lifetime guarantee"". If anything goes wrong, Koss replaces them. If you try them, there is no risk .I'm a podcaster. I use them 2-4 hours a day everyday 365 days a year.They have NEVER let me down. And for the money, the mic is the best you will find at the price.One note: If you have a large head. these will need some breaking in. Out the box, they are pretty tight around your head."
4,Does the Job,Does the job for the price! Fits my budget and provides value to me for my use. Recommended item for people not looking for something fancy!
3,"Good sound, very isolating, first one arrived with one bad ear","I was not particularly happy when this arrived, with one ear dead after two seconds. The replacement (thank you Amazon) arrived and is fine so far. For the price, though, I can get three pair of Frisbys which are a match in everything but isolation, and personally I find more comfortable. I wear glasses and have to stretch the over-head to maximum so my ear isn't uncomfortably squeezed between the glasses' earpiece and the headset ear surround. Headsets in general never seem to last more than a year, so I will not spend the money on Koss again. Someone else in the house likes them well enough to use them, fortunately."
5,Incredible Value!,"I bought one pair of these about a year ago for use with my amateur radio transceiver. I liked it so much, I started using it with my iPhone and for Skype calls on my computer. Recently, I purchased a second one so that I don't have to keep switching it around between devices.The sound quality for voice is excellent. It compares well to $100+ communications headsets I have owned."
3,good but not great,"At first when I got the product I was happy, but two things happened.My cubicle neighbor compared it to the koss portapro with me.What sounded great became muffled in comparison to the clarity of the other headphone. Also, after a while using it your ear starts hurting from the pressure.The mircrophone works great though."
4,Camper Mirrors are very good,They look like factory mirrors on my Suburban. Fit tight. A hair tough putting on and off but I'm getting the hang of it.I like em!
3,Trailering mirrors,Good rear vision but the mounting procedure is not that great. Had the passenger side blow off at highway speeds. Make sure it is mounted correctly and check the tension on the hold down screw every once in a while.
2,"Passenger side was fine, but the driver's side was stripped.","Passenger side was fine, but the driver's side was stripped or something. The plastic thumbwheel screw only went 1/2 way in before there was little tension and didn't continue to tighten."
4,SEEM TO BE GREAT!,"THE MIRRORS INSTALLED RATHER SIMPLY. I HAVE ON USED THEM ON A SHORT TRIP, BUT THEY GIVE ADDED REAR TRAILER VISABILITY."
4,Great Mirrors,I have used these mirror extensions on my '02 GMC Sierra and they have worked great for the past two years. I tried a few other mirror extensions and they all failed at some point or another by falling off or vibrating too much. These have really out preformed them all.Only getting another set because one broke in a car wash and they only sell them as a set. It is cheaper to by them from Amazon as a set rather then buy then individually at Camping World.
5,Not Much Vibration,These are really nice. No shaking they stay pretty steady and look so much nicer than the metal mirrors. They have a very custom look.
5,Good CD,Bought for the old school music couldn't find local has a bunch of older songs i like from different artist
1,Toy Printer,"A most frustrating printer - it makes all sorts of noises at startup, during and after a simple print or copy. Hard to imagine why so many machanical noises are needed. Quality is just ok and the wireless setup is unpredictable."
2,Most ridiculous printer ever!,"This printer is completely nuts. The photo quality is okay, but is SO noisy. It sounds like a machine gun is going off inside it, and it shakes. It also makes really weird loud noises right after it prints something. I just printed a document on fast draft b&w, and it seriously shot the paper 5 feet out of the printer. I am not even exaggerating. I had to pick it up off the floor. It's been like this since I got it. I would not recommend this printer to anyone. I've had much nicer and smoother running printers for less than the cost of this one."
2,Problem after problem,"I purchased this printer at a local BJ's wholesale store. The instructions were clear and easy to read, so set up was a cinch. I immediately began printing wirelessly from my PC and from a memory card inserted directly into the printer. The quality was great and I was impressed with the machine.That is until I tried scanning or copying, which came out pitch black. After a long time on the phone with HP's support, I was told something was wrong with the mirrors and we could get a refurbished one sent to me. I declined and went back to BJ's and got a new one. I set that one up and discovered that the small color display didn't work on this one. I called HP again and they were unable to fix it and offered the same refurbished deal. Two brand new printers fresh out of the box that are both defective are too much for me. See you later, HP!"
3,Fair,"I love the printer! However, it did not come with ink cartridges. Very disappointed in seller. Also, the printer would not work - even to fax or scan documents - without all of the ink cartridges working well."
4,"Great, but does skip a bit on one song.","Received as promised. On the album, on one or two songs, it skips a bit."
3,Only Econ Geeks Need to Apply (the OEGNA facility),"Poor Ben. His wet dream is to study the Great Depression and he gets to live it real time. Unfortunately all the math, calculus, differential equations and log graphs don't really seem to apply at the extremes of human behavior; eg fear of depression levels of inaction.Reading this book helps one realize academically Ben is as prepared as anyone in the world to deal with the current economic dislocation. However no patient responds well to a doctor delivering the message that he is seeking help from the world's best cancer expert.I have an MBA in finance and accounting and a bs in mathematics and find his works to be difficult to get through. However if you just read the prose and accept that his calculations are correct many interesting tid bits come out of the book."
1,Long Boring Read,"Lots of data, but the story to tell seems to have never been found. The findings are really not that interesting."
4,NO USB Port,"Ignore the second picture, there is no USB port on this item. Sellers (like ANTOnline) will not work with you to fix this, since amazon poorly directs people to buy from them."
3,Western Civilization,"not what I expected, or useful for the purpose that I needed. But would work well along side the text."
2,Didn't grand theory die some time ago?,"Wilson's Consilience amounts to grand theorizing of Parsonian scale and suffers from the same flaws. Wilson's thesis is an attractive one. I believe that much has been lost in our neglect of the value of cross-disciplinary perspectives. However, no one person should even attempt to bring these vast fields of knowledge together. Such one-man attempts will ultimately lose credibility due to -- as Wilson does -- selective reading and presentation of various fields. On a final note, it appears in some places that Wilson really doesn't buy his own arguments -- especially concerning cultural inputs on biological evolution."
2,Iconoclastic Scientism,"This book is too big an attempt by the famed Harvard biology professor to try to cover ""everything"". If we compare Mr. Wilson's ""total map"" with Mr. Ken Wilber's attempt on the same kind of synthesis. It will become obvious that Mr. Wilson fell short because he puts an ""Environmental Policy"" category where a ""Spirits/Psychology"" one is more appropriate. How can any integration attempt misses such important inner subjects?! I guess Mr. Wilson decided that he will stick to his iconoclastic scientism view rather than being open-minded. We, as readers, should be aware of his bias. There was a Newsweek bookreview article titled: ""Why Wilson is Wrong"" published in 1999."
3,This will never work. . . .,"Ever since reading Martin Gardner's -Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science-, I've always been troubled by books that lead off with the assertion that various ""experts"" will dismiss what the author has to say out of hand. This does not inspire confidence.The ""Enlightenment"" was doomed from the beginning: doomed, mostly, by the inherited biological traits that Wilson's better work in science shows as putting constraints on human culture. Derrida and especially Foucault were on to something: it really is all about power. Humans find it difficult to think with the detachment they'd have to because they spend too much of their time occupied with stupid primate social games. Nobody is going to be able to herd these apes into coordinating their scientific efforts across disciplines, without each group of specialists wanting theirs to be queen of the sciences, and my contribution to be the brightest gem in the crown. Chimpanzee politics dooms consilience."
3,How the Gifted Brain Learns,This is a great book. Educators should read this one and the rest of the series. More learning about the brain can help us forward education.
2,Impossible to play but fun to listen to,"We were so disappointed when we brought this home from the store - my childhood memories of playing Operation were crushed. The pieces are impossible to remove with the tongs! & although the Homer voice is funny, it becomes extremely frustrating to even the most steadiest of 'doctors'. My children will pull the game out & try to play but within minutes they are nearly swearing because it is so hard to get the pieces. If it wasn't for the funny voice, this would be a complete waste of money!"
5,great shoes,"My son loves the shoes and we were very happy with how quickly they were shipped out, especially when we ordered last minute before school starting. Thanks."
4,Formulaic trance saved by One And One,"I got this about a couple of years ago when I needed something to get through some really dismal stretches at work. And in all honesty, passing plenty of time is probably the best use for this album, as Robert Miles' vision of trance 1. is not a very accurate representation of trance and 2. is really, really repetitious (seriously, I'm like the most forgiving person in the country when it comes to repetitious music, and even I think he's really pushing it here).Nevertheless, this is very pleasant, pretty music, and definitely a good choice for introducing someone to trance. Just make sure you move on to the real stuff at some point.Oh, and for One and One, and I'm dead serious when I say this saved the album. It's 3-star material without it. Absolutely lovely, poignant, wish it were longer. Much longer."
3,New Age goes Techno... what has the world come to?,"This CD starts off good. There's some good beats, though a little repetitive and wonderful melodies. By the time you get to the end of the CD, if you're still awake, you might think you've heard that song already. Perhaps you have since there's repeats of songs, just different ""remixes"" (though I can hardly tell the difference). Or perhaps you haven't and you're just recognizing that he use the same head pounding bass at the same tempo through every song, the same octave of the piano, and the same humming girl. I have to admit, there is a good start, but it needs a little more originality. If you want a CD that will help you sleep, though, this is the one to get."
2,Forget this and go for Salt Tanks Science & Nature.....,"Dreamland has one good track ""Children"" the rest are just bad imitations or remixes. Dreamland lacks diversity, the same old kick-drum, thumping away. If its really cool dreamy stuff youre looking for try:- Salt Tank's Science&Nature instead, Dreamland doesnt even come close...."
5,THE FABLE FANTASTIC,"Robert Miles was one of the few artists to make me think twice about dance musica. The track ""FABLE"" is perfect. It was featured on the trailer for the Drew Barrymore film ""EVERAFTER"" and everyone was asking 'who is that'? It was not featured on the soundtrack. Another stunning track would be ""CHILDREN"" though FABLE is the stand-out track on this recording. Overall, a great CD, a few tracks, I don't listen too."
5,LISTEN UP! THIS IS A MUST HAVE CD,"This is one of greatest CD's I own! Miles takes you on a ride, and never lets you fall! I have read some of the reviews here, the ones that claim this CD is repetitive, well there are two tracks on the CD that are similiar, one with some vocal and one without. But I can tell you that those two songs take you on a completely different journey. I have this CD in my house, in my car, and in all my friends cars...it seems that we cannot get enough of Robert Miles. We just wish that he would come out with a new CD with this flavor. Now do yourself a favor and buy the CD and enjoy the trip."
3,If you want trance...there's a lot better stuff out there...,"Children is a great track, there is no denying it. There are a few other gems. But this record suffers from what you will read in all the other reviews---numbing simplicity. (I still can't figure out why everyone seems to like ""Fable"" so much...it's goofy syntax. Who ever says ""tell me a fable?"" Maybe ""tell me a story"" or an anecdote or even spin a yarn. A fable? Weird.)Anyhow, it's not bad. I'd recommend borrowing it first to see if you like it."
3,Acoustic Twins?,"This E.P. is possibly the closest thing you'll hear to ""Cocteau Twins - Unplugged"". No drum machines, no jangling electric guitar Cocteau-style, not even reverb. Just 4 tracks featuring piano, acoustic guitar, and just a hint of synth. The highlight track would be ""Half-Gifts"" that adds an emotional string-enesemble track that kind of harkens back to ""Another Day"" sung by Elizabeth Frazier for the cover group ""This Mortal Coil."" The second highlight would be ""Pink Orange Red"" which originally opens the Twins' E.P. ""Tiny Dynamine"", done in this acoustic setting. There are a mixed breed of Twins' fans out there and some may be set aback by this recording. However, loyal fans may find this EP an interesting switch in direction from their ususal lush electric reverb style."
5,I absolutely loved it!,"This book is great. If I wasn't so anti-violence and war I could have easily finished this book in a day. A great read for all Nigerians, especially young Igbos."
3,African version of Birdsong,"A member in our Bookclub observed that there were really only about 9 major topics to write about so it was inevitable that similarities pop up from timt to time.I enjoyed the African perspective and viewpoint that the rest of the World did not seem concerned about the suffering in Biafra, and was glad to be so informed about that sordid part of Nigerian history."
4,"Excellent, Excellent!","This was a wonderful novel with a lot to offer. Although set during wartime, you were immersed in the day-to-day lives of characters who continued to create a ""normal"" life in the most difficult situations. This story was heroic and full of spirit."
2,Boring.,"I appreciate that this book has an afrocentric point of view and we're able to get a glimpse into the life of 1960 era Nigerians. Also, I appreciated some of the conversations that took place in the book. In particular, there was a convo about why Africans like to refer to themselves by Tribe rather than by nation. Chimamanda is also a great writer, I will give that to her. However, that's where my adoration ends.I gave this book 2 stars because it is simply boring. There wasn't much suspense or anxiety that spanned the entire 440 pages I read. Yeah I know its 546 pages. I gave the book ample time to get its s*it together but I just couldn't finish it."
5,Half of a Yellow Sun,"The author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is brilliant. The novel is well written, organized and impressive. This is a most read for the international community who is interested in Africa. I highly recommend this book for all."
4,Fast read!,"I was a child during the civil war. This book is a fiction based on the war and I thoroughly enjoyed, very fast read!"
5,Excellent system.,"I bought this 4 years ago. Gives realistic sound. As an example, while playing one of the Moto GP games on my Xbox 360, it sounds like I am at the race track on the motorcycle."
5,Best waterproffer for Sunbrella,Expensive but still the best water proofer for marine and patio fabrics bar none. For large areas I buy a gallon and apply it with a garden sprayer. The little spray bottles are not sufficient to do large mooring or cockpit covers.
1,.... Not a Skin Flick........,"Don't confuse this movie with the rest of the ""Emanuelle"" movies. The character in this movie is actually called ""Sheena"". There's a little full frontal nudity during the first 1/4 of the movie. No sexual scenes except for a quick blurp of a woman being raped before she jumps out of a window. If you're looking for an arousing skin flick equal to the other emanuelle movies, stay away from here. If you're looking for a cheeply dubbed foreign movie with a predictable plot... This one's for you."
5,A must-read title for anyone who grew up in the 1960s,"This book is a sympathetic, yet objective portrayal of the coming-of-age of four brothers in the 1960s: a G.I. who volunteered for Vietnam, a yippie activist, a convert to Hinduism and their awkward, introverted youngest brother. I especially recommend it for anyone who grew up in that turbulent era."
5,I HAVE READ THIS BOOK 3 TIMES,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ...I HAVE READ IT 3 TIMES AND IT NEVER FAILS TO AMAZE ME...IT IS WONDERFUL...IT TAKES YOU TO A PLACE FEW OTHER BOOKS EVER CAN..I REALLY LIKE THE STORY AND THE SOMEWHAT DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY...A REAL TREAT..DON'T LET YOUR POLITICS GET IN THE WAY OF THIS FANTASTIC BOOK
5,Looks Great,I use this chain alot for heavy pendants. It is a great size and the quality is great. I should have ordered two!
1,Item never received,Payment was taken out of my account 2 days after ordering in October. It is now December 16th and have not received the item. Customer service is impossible to het hold of.
5,Check your order!,"Just received the Miller jersey from NFL Shop. Everything looked correct, including the labeling on the plastic wrapper. I opened the wrapper to find a very well constructed Steelers jersey in the correct size, but when I unfolded the jersey, it was that of another Steelers player. I called NFL Shop and they were very professional in issuing a Return Merchandise Label and offered me a discount and free shipping on future orders."
4,The artwork is so beautiful,"The artwork of this cover and book is so beautiful. The reason why I gave this book four stars is because the comic is continued, and these comics are expensive and very hard to find."
4,Great for anyone else...good for Queensryche,"This album is the best album made during the Grunge-era, but definitely isn't Queensryche's best. It has a lot of good songs, and is a great album to listen to straight through, but only has two standout songs. ""Bridge"" is amazing and has some of the most emotional lyrics of any song I've heard. ""Someone Else?"" is on of the most beautiful ballads created in human history. The other songs exhibit Queensryche's huge talent, but don't quite hit the nail on the head. A must buy album if you like the Ryche, a must buy if you love progressive metal, and a must buy if you love great musicianship."
3,It works,The handlebars are easy to install and they work as advertised. My problem is if you put too much pressure on them you get the joy if dealing with handlebars which suddenly move. No matter how much I tighten them they will dip on me when I lesst expect it.
2,Crap figment,I should have paid attention to the reviews. It's cheap and you get what you at for. No directions and it does not stay placed
4,"This is a good set, but......","I like D&D; Miniatures giants of Legend Huge Pack because many huge size monsters come out in this set. You can have a hugh red dragon, which isn't like the red dragon (Young) (God...... So small...... Can this dragon damage me?), which cannot make you feel terror when it's in front of other small pieces. It's HUGE red dragon now so it makes the game more real and more fun when you play both D&D; and D&D; Miniatures. In addition, painting job is better than other sets. I like it.However, each box comes with one HUGE SIZE piece (It's what we pay for it.), but there are total 12 huge size piece in this set. It means that it's very eary to get a lot duplicate huge size pieces before you get what you want to have such as Red Dragon or Golden Dragon. It's why I only give it 4 stars, not 5 stars."
3,Sturdy but heavy and very short valve stem,I can not attest to the puncture resistance yet but they sure seems sturdy.The tube is really heavy though and so thick walled so that it doesn't seem to properly expand inside a Kenda Kourier 700x40 tire I use it with. Furthermore the valve 'stem' is so short so that it may be tricky to pump with some pumps.
4,The little engine that could.,"This is a CD single of Public Enemy's song ""Nighttrain"". It's a very good song. There are four remixes of it, including two instrumentals. Two of the remixes sample the James Brown song ""Get Up, Get Into It, Get Involved"", and two do not. The ""b-side"" is ""More News at 11"", which is pretty good."
4,Small Front Wheels,"The walker seems to be fine, but the front wheels are very small and it can be a problem at the time you are walking, nice color and shapes."
1,el audio no corresponde a la agrupacion.,hola compre este cd y lo esperaba con ansias pero al momento de reproducirlo me encuentro con la sorpresa que el contenido del cd el audio es de mariachi y nada de la sonora dinamita me siento estafado.
4,Keep dancing like no one is watching!,"This is the first Yoga DVD I have ever bought. I just started Yoga for the New Year and I have to say, that this is a wonderful introduction! I was a bit overwhelmed the first time I tried the DVD but I improved ten-fold on my second attempt. Do not be discouraged at first if you are a beginner because your learning curve and even flexibility will improve quicker than you think. I enjoyed the music and moves and most of all, you feel so elated and much lighter after this workout. I am sure by following this DVD a few times a week, I will notice a huge improvement in my focus, strength, and body tone. I will definately be buying more DVD's of this series. Keep on dancing like no one is watching!!!"
1,Truly Awful,"Since I had enjoyed other DVDs of Ana and Ravi's, I was looking forward to this one. I shouldn't have wasted my money. I was expecting that at some point, a mention would be made by a narrator as to what chakra was being worked, and what the movement being done would affect. No such luck. In addition, the silly, incorrect form on the punching was so ridiculous it was embarrassing to watch and I turned the thing off. I am used to watching martial artists punching and Ana was pathetic. She should have picked a different move. My husband said he got the impression the DVD was just an excuse for Ana to ""do her thing"" and it wasn't meant to really teach anything or give a decent workout."
5,This DVD is everything everybody says it is.,I never write reviews of things I've bought on-line but I felt compelled to write about this dvd. I was looking for an exercise dvd that I would enjoy instead of dread. This one is great! I felt great after I finished it the first time and couldn't wait to do it again. Matrix option menu is awesome! I am going to buy more DVDs by Ana and Ravi. Definitely recommend for beginner and beyond.
4,I just love this video!,"I have been doing yoga for almost 30 years now and resisted anything having to do with Kundalina until now. I love to dance so decided to give this video a try and found that it is the most uplifting yoga video I have ever done. The movements with Breath of Fire are mildly challenging, but doable. The dancing is so fluid and fun, but still works muscles in unexpected places. I was pleasantly sore the day after my first session. Many of the mudras create in me a blissful feeling that lasts all day. I found myself smiling like an idiot all day! I would recommend this video to anyone, beginner on up, as an enjoyable and enlightening experience."
5,"Oh, Al Green...Never fails to please!",This CD is great! His music is so soulful and every song has a certain sound to it. It is pretty hard to not love Al Green. The compilation of songs chosen for this particular album are some of his greatest!!
5,son loved it,Son really gets into the oldies. he really like the cd and it is good quality. Good purchase. Would buy again
4,great green,"i love all al,s songs and he just has a voice that people like and im satisfied with all the cuts in the disc"
3,Al Geen Greatest Hits,I have the original album on cassette. Where is 'How Can You Mend A Broken Heart' at?Very sadly dissappointed in it not being there. It made the original album.
4,Hi And Mighty 2CD Import Has Mo' Al And Mo' Better Sound,"don't get me wrong -- any al is good al, but 'greatest hits' comes up way short with several choice cuts missing. the 'hi and mighty' 2CD import set on hi records uk is the one to get. it uses the original masters and the sound is much better. you also get almost all of green's best tracks in one package. i do, however, like the cover photo on this one -- it's a classic. and if you have a dvd-audio player, definitely get that version with 5.1 surround -- it sounds great."
2,Don't just don't,"This book has been out since i was in public school and now i'm in College..by the cover even you can tell this is a bad buy. The book is a pamphlet, barely showing anything and the style is horrid.if you want to buy a real manga teaching series, check out the how to draw manga!2/5for old memories sake"
4,"Smart to start off with this, not smart to advance with it","This book is very helpfull for beginers and helped me a great deal to learn the very basics. The lack of professional quality is good and bad simply because it does not intimidate younger readers, but lacks a variety of essential knoledge needed for for middle and high quality drawings. I must recomend this book to people who need a boost to start. When I first started drawing I was limited because I had no tecnique, and when I read this book I had a entirely larger understanding of simple animating rules and my works imedialy improved. I have Now been drawing for three years and I have become a winner of several art contests and my drawings are near proffessional quality. BUT, this book ONLY helped me get started. For artists of no or little experience, THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU!! But for artists with a lust to advance, go for a book done by a proffesional."
5,Loved it,This was recommended by a friend and I can't thank her enough. It breaks this art style down in a way that's both easy to understand and gives an excellent foundation. This was exactly what I was looking for and I'm now in love with Manga!
2,Only for the younger crowd,"If you're above the age of eight, this book is not for you. It shows you how to draw over-simplified figures that can hardly be called ""manga."" Well, it doesn't really ""show you."" Coope hardly gives you four steps for drawing a face, and it's difficult to imitate unless you know what you're doing. I guess I can't criticize too much, since this book is obviously aimed towards the younger crowd, like I said in my title.Still, I don't recommend copying her style and attempting to create manga, because it actually doesn't look like the real thing, to be blunt. It's ridiculous. Each character has blush on top of their noses, and now that I brought up noses, the noses she draws are horribly small. Where is the collar bone on the neck? Even if you ignore the deformed facial features, how are you supposed to draw a side view of your manga characters Coope-style if the noses are so small?I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. Not really recommended.~Lina-chan"
5,Great book!,"This book reviews the culture of Jesus' time the way it was in Palestine and the way it was in Rome, very adequately. You almost feel like you'e been there."
5,Mary Poppins keeps Poppin,"Who doesn't remember with fondness the film, ""Mary Poppins"", It's almost a household name. What made this film so special was not only the casting of Julie Andrews and Dick van Dyke; but the immortal melodies of the Sherman brothers. This 2 CD set has all the music from the film, plus more. An extended journey, you might say. Complete with booklet containing all the lyrics to the songs and disc 2 has bonus material, including the Sherman brothers reminiscing over their work on Mary Poppins. So to relive the audio brilliance of Mary Poppins you just have to have this Soundtrack recording. I find myself continually playing this CD when I need a lift."
1,Terrible stuff,The shake is kind of watery and kind of salty and generally pretty disgusting to drink. I will stick to Spiru-tein.
4,bob marley concert in germany,"this is the concert in germany from 1980,which is great, i had been interested in the documentary about this concert by stefan paul, have not been able to find it yet."
5,For What It's Worth,"This is a well done debut from Everclear considering the circumstances in which it was recorded. Now, this album is no hit after hit album, there are misses, but that doesn't overshadow the standout tracks. 'Your Genius Hands' is an awesome opening track that is packed full of fury, which sets the tone of 'World of Noise'. We see hints of later Alexakis-genius in 'Loser Makes Good', 'Pennsylvania Is...' and 'Sparkle', but the true, raw emotion isn't felt until you hear 'Fire Maple Song', which to date is one of Alexakis' best songs."
4,A good cd but not thier best,"Any early cd for a great band! This cd shows us the begning roots of a search band, the songs don't begin to get into Everclear's groove until after the 5th track on the cd and after, even then they;'re not quite like the groove they've found. I just bougth this cd and have previously owned all of thier other ones, this one wasn't a shock to me because it is thier first cd. What is now the SOUND of everclear the sound you can recgonize when ytou hear one of htier songs no matter when you come in on it is not inlaid in this cd because they were still trying to find it. Over all this is a good cd but it's not thier best it's thier earliest, good lyrics and good sound but it's the begning of the everclear I know and not yet what they are to me so it leaves something lacking which is present in all of thier other incrediable cds!!"
1,not THAT good,"if you like father of mine you probaly won't like this because the most popular song on the cd is most often, the only song that sounds like that. if you think you like it but don't know just get realplayer or liquid and listen to the samples"
1,Not happy at all. Zero star,"It arrives shortly after ordered. Not bad.It comes in a small plastic bag, a free give-away for Verizon. No manual, no real package, even no Plantronics logo on it.The price was good. But, the mechant should make it clear that it is not an ""original"" Plantronics product.It makes me feel cheated.As for the product itself, as the other reviewer said - a bit weird. But, that's my own choice. No blame to the merchant."
2,MX250 Review,"The price is outstanding. Because of the under-ear support system, keeping the Ear Bud up in the ear canal is a little challenging unless you have exactly the right proportioned ear. Sound quality is good but volume is low because the speaker portion won't stay up in place snugly. The ergonomics are awkward."
3,The real king arthure - Pt 2,More visceral and magic than I was expecting! Very good but perhaps a little too fixated on battles and chivalry. I scanned the last hald but still enjoyed the gist
4,A very interesting read,"I purchased this in soft cover, planning to give it to my mother for Christmas, but I read it first and liked it enough that I ordered the hard cover for my mother and kept the soft cover for myself. This is a fascinating read. What makes it more than a great animal story is the way it is told within the historical context of the time. There were so many interesting facts and descriptions detailing the period from before, during, and after the Civil War, Reconstruction, and into the early 20th century. The subject matter is extremely fresh, told in an easy manner that makes it fast and easy to read and yet memorable and thought provoking. The subtitle of the soft cover is slightly different from the hard cover -- soft says, the Lost History of the World's Smartest Horse; hard says, the Lost History of a Horse and a Man Who Changed the World. I suspect the change was made to attract readers. The text is the same in both versions."
1,He is an athlete not a rapper!,This is a mockery of the art form the we know as hip-hop. He had to be high off drugs when he was making this garbage music.
5,The best of its kind!,"After reading several other books on the same topic, I ordered and read this one hoping I'd get at least one important tip from this book that I didn't get from the rest. Much to my surprise, I found that this book was the most informative, useful and up-to-date source I'd come across. It was well organized and very thorough - far more so than The Food Service Professional's Guide. It covers every facet of the business and offers practical advice on how to run a successful catering business and also provides numerous resources in the back that will help you further your career. This book has become my primary source of reference. I can't praise it enough!"
5,My first party was a blast!!!,"I just catered my first party and thanks to this book and Secrets From a Caterers Kitchen, the party was a success. It was for 15 guests and everyone loved to food and the presentation. My client has already booked me for a future event. Thanks Denise!!!"
4,HOME BASE BUSINESS,"THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE I JUST WISHED IT WAS LONGER, I AM PLEASED WITH THE SERVICE AND PRODUCT. THANKS"
3,Very mis-leading,"Let me start by saying that this book has some useful information if you know nothing about catering. My biggest complaint is that there is no such thing as a home based caterer. In nearly every state, town, and rural township in the country, it is illegal to run a catering business out of your house. Just keep that in mind when you buy this book."
3,ezfoodie,"The book was very informative in reference to the documentations /paperworks needed to control and be a success in this type of business. I am looking for a more technical book on catering, since i did not go to school to learn catering. I love to cook and people ask me to cook for them for small parties. I am actually looking for a book that would help me learn more about average portions of food (meat, vegetables, pasta) and do conversions to larger groups....etc."
3,Drinking Water is not enough,"I have read this book very carefully and in short I find it too simplistic. The author claims that most common diseases like asthma, allergies, high blood pressure, arthritic pain, heartburn, etc., are mostly due to the fact that most people don't drink enough water and their body are thirsty.It is very important for your health to drink a considerable amount of water daily, as it is to exercise, control your weight or take care of your diet and the kind of food you eat.The author stresses the importance of the quantity of water you should ingest daily, but I have found no mention to the water quality. There is no reference to the differences between tap water, mineral water, filtered water, ionised water and so on. The water mainly differentiates by their mineral content, calcium content (hardness) and pH content.I rate this book 3 stars because in spite of the mentioned limitations I find it important to motivate people to drink more water."
2,Too technical,"The book was filled with very good information, however, unless you're in the medical field or somewhat familiar with medical lingo, I would not recommend this book. This book is filled with 98% medical jargon and reasons our bodies need constant replenishment of water and 5% of actual information on what we can do about it. I can summarize the book in this sentence and save you money ""drink plenty of water, even when you're not thirsty. Years of dehydration can and may be taking a toll on your body""."
1,Who can drink this much water?,"If I drink 1 oz per 2 lbs, that is 110 oz of water per day. That is an insane amount of water and also a ton of water weight. Also, the fluid retention can be dangerous as well as your body cannot keep up getting rid of that much water.Thus, swelling occurs and pain happens.I am deeply skeptical. I believe drinking water is good but 110 oz a day?"
5,The great need for today.,This book is not only written well but gives great stories of true heroes we have unfortunately forgotten about. This is a must read for adults and teenagers. Get a true vision of real Heroes again.
3,For the younger studier of earth science,I used this book for a class I took. It is definitely for someone with no prior knowledge to eaerth science. This would include if you have taken any middle or high school level Geoscience class
2,Way too Easy,"I got a 710 and 730 taking the quizzes (given, I've forgotten everything from AP) and I don't think I had enough time to answer enough questions to get more than a 710.The actual test is much harded.I am giving it two stars because at least it had the right format, if not the right questions.I did not deal with the review sections of the book so I will not comment on that. But I bought the book for the quizzes and I was not prepared."
3,Aquarevelations,"I bought this book after reading the author's previous ""Search for the Giant Squid"". Giant Squid was very good. This book however,is a double edge sword, it has great illustrations and the topics look interesting, BUT many facts are wrong!Examples: page 2, states that the Dinosaurs ""disappeared hundreds of millions of years ago"" (65 million years would have been correct.) Page 117 identifies the Mississippian Age Bear Gulch Formation as Devonian Age. Page 51 and 52 and 53 list Horseshoe crabs as dating from 200 million years ago but there are well known horseshoe crabs as old as 370 million years old!Page 53 also lists Aglaspids as being horseshoe crabs when they are not considered to be.I teach, and the accuracy of material is important. I don't want to present ideas to my students if they aren't right. The book is interesting, but the errors I see at a quick skim make me pause."
3,yet it did happen...,"This album doesnt quit hold up to the privious one, but on its own holds its own."
4,Almost full access.,"I call this ""Almost full access"" because they could have the whole concert on this dvd.The rest on this dvd could have been included as a bonus.Good music snd interesting filming of Bosephus in the Montana outdoors.Well spent money,good beer music."
5,Meet Archie as a Youth,"This book is full of the Riverdale crew as young children....but many of the personality traits remain the same. There are also adventure tales here, with mad scientists and world takeover plots. All ages will love this volume. I have never loved the Little Archie stories, but after reading the volume, I have grown to appreciate and enjoy them. The tales here are diverse, and the artwork is phenomenal. You will not regret buying this sweet little volume. I am sure glad that I gave it a whirl. It has timeless fun enclosed and, as another review noted, it is not dumbed down at all. It is written in the same style as every Archie comic."
4,Second Sight,Wonderfully funny movie. I watch it over and over. Highly recommended to anyone who likes to laugh.
3,Quite a decent little Harmonica,"Generally, I like it. I got it within two days of ordering, and it's a nice little harmonica to wail tunes on. The only real complaint I can have is that mine had (and still has)a nice big dent on the bottom. It doesn't seem to effect the playing, and it adds a sense of character to it, so I really don't mind. I've grown attached to it just as I have to all of my other instruments, so it fits right in, next to my Hohner."
4,Good refeence guide,Good reference book for taking along on walks while looking for artifacts. Easy to use and easy to stuff in a pocket or backpack.
5,It Is Worth The Money,"I am a male in my early 40's and despite that the book was geared towards females, I thought the book was excellent. I could relate to just about everything she wrote about and agree with it. I was extremely pleased to discover this book, it help me understand the problem with food addiction. I got a lot out of the book, it was worth the small price, even if you got just a one or two little thoughts out of it."
5,We love it...,"I bought this tank for my boyfriend almost a year ago, and it's held up great! I originally bought him the khaki-colored one and he wore it so much I got him the black one for his birthday. Definitely high-quality and well made."
3,Got Milk?,"12x5: In which The Stones' U.S. record company (taking Capitol's then-current hatchet job of The Beatles' discography as some sort of twisted, greed-inspired cue) milks Mick & Co. for all they were worth (striking while the iron was hot, and all that) by chopping up their UK albums into little red, white, and blue pieces for optimum profitabilty, artistic integrity be damned. Whatever -- it was the early-sixties, after all, and no one thought these long-haired hooligans would turn into Icons. But my question today is this: why not release the original UK sources (""Five by Five"", ""Rolling Stones no.2"") as part of the new remaster series, thereby settling a score of sorts with history? Just a thought...."
4,A fun read.,It's an enjoyable read about one of the strangest things to happen in the LoTR fandom from one of the people caught up in it.Interesting to note that the three bad reviews here come from people who seem to have something against the author wanting to write the book in the first place.
1,Very difficult to learn from,"I used this book as a freshman in college for a Honors Linear Algebra course. The book is absolutely impossible to learn new material from. It does more demonstration of facts rather than teaching and gives very few real examples (rather than proofs using variables). My professor recommended Anton's Elementary Linear Algebra as a supplement to this textbook, and Anton's book was far superior in its ability to teach linear algebra"
5,Un libro excelente,"Estudié Algebra Lineal por este libro cuando hacía la licenciatura en Matemática en 1.979. Después de todos estos años quise repasar los conceptos de Álgebra Lineal de una manera rigurosa pero amena, con ejemplos. Busque los nuevos libros, revisé varios y me decidí de nuevo por éste. Lo recomiendo."
3,Metal detector,"This is okay for smaller children i would say 6 to 9 range, but does not work well if metal is to far under ground so they get bored with it after awhile. Great for that age group though and set up your own treasure hunt. Just dont bury anything more than 7 inches."
5,"Brillant,why can't we get it in ENGLAND","The five tracks I heard are very good,and the rest of the titles are what this seasonal time of the year is all about. Why can't we get it in England?"
5,This will become a Christmas classic for you and your family,"Anne Murray has a wonderful way of warming your heart through song. Her classic rendition of Christmas carols will delight your family and friends and add special sentiment to the season. If you have ever purchased a Christmas CD only to go home and be disappointed with the artists ""personal"" version, you will be pleasantly surprised here. Anne Murray sings these carols as they were meant to be, as you remember them from days gone by - modest, warm and joyful. You will certainly enjoy these beautifully done songs."
1,Died after a few months.,I've bought two of these. Both died after a few months of use. We took the second one apart and found: 1. Every time you move the mic it creates friction on the tiny wire that leads into the left earphone until the wire is cut. 2. The inside of the earpiece had bare wires that shorted out after a while. I don't plan to buy a third one!
2,Works great...for a year,"Well, it was a great buy for the first year. After that it started loosing sound in the right ear. I figured I could live with that. Now it looses sound in both ears on and off. I go from sound to nothing to one ear all the time. It is the most annoying thing I have ever experienced. Buy a better headset and don't spend the money twice."
2,Overpriced,"You can find the same exact product at various hardware stores, etc. for half the price and no shipping."
4,New blade for B&D mulcher mower,The new blade made a big differnce to how well the mower but. Quick and easy to install.
3,"It's like a new shaver, for your lawn.","First, the B&D electric mowers are pretty nice, but the blades are crap. I've always heard that there are 2 types of steel, the kind that start sharp and stay sharp but can never be sharpened, and the kind like this blade is made from, that are soft, can be made sharp, but require lots of attention. This blade is the most extreme example of a blade that needs a lot of attention. In fact, I'm now sharpening the blade after about every 2-3 mowings, rather than once a season. The reason, this steel is SOFT. Every rock, every stick nicks it. No gas mower I ever owned had a blad this soft. But nevertheless, this blade is cheaper than a new mower, and after plenty of sharpening, there's nothing to do but get a new blade. I won't criticize this blade for the engineering deficiency of the mower. I'll just say that it's fine and does a good job, and is priced right."
4,lawn mower blade for electric mower,"Easy to install, seems to be cutting very well. Not sure about durability at this time. I would recommend it to others."
4,New Sharp Blade,Amazon is the only place I found that carried replacement blades for my electric B&D mower!
4,The genuine article,"The local B&D parts center has these, but they're packaged in about twenty square feet of Saran Wrap, which won't necessarily protect your hands, and they don't include an instruction packet. Besides, they cost more. You may as well buy them at Amazon.com - since you might actually have bought the mower here, as I did. And when you install them, you'll find that the mower performs like new, especially if you're a more competent installer than I am, which you probably are."
5,The best Cyptmas...I mean Christmas Album in my Collection!,"This album isn't for everyone, but if you have a warped sense of humor and don't mind poking fun at Christmas, this album is for you. It's absolute zaniness brings grins each year I pull this disc out for Christmas"
4,Showing its age and quality,"The first Paul Butterfield Blues Band album and Hard Road by John Mayall started me on a course of loving the blues. The Butterfield East-West album was memorable particularly for the best Michael Bloomfield track ever ""I've got a mind to give up living"" and for ""Work Song"" and ""East-West"". After 40 years, I bought this album hoping to re-capture the magic. The most memorable aspect of the original was the interplay between the members of the band.The first rendition of East West suffered from its quality due to Paul Butterfield's harmonica hardly being heard. However, it still was fascinating to hear those guys live.The second rendition was much more true to the studio album. However, it did not really add anything new.The third rendition was the same but longer.While I love the album, I still disappointed because it did not generate the same feelings as back in 1966."
1,This books sucks,Do not waste your time with this book. You will be terribly disappointed by the ending. I suggest you take a 2 hour nap instead of reading this book!
3,Classic Old-Style History,"Cooke was a Virginian who began publishing in the 1850s. He helped found the Richmond Howitzers but soon joined J.E.B. Stuart's staff. In his life Cooke wrote over 30 books, including biographies of two men he knew, R.E. Lee and T.J. Jackson. I was searching for Cooke's 1850s stories hoping for some early ethnography, but purchased this one because of an excessively intimate connection to Flowerdew Hundred.Written after the failure of the Confederacy, Cooke - surprise - reminds readers that Virginians played critical roles in the formation of our nation. I have not gotten through it, but of course the lenses are rose-tinted and the story is typical old history. Cooke ranks as an important American intellectual and he wrote for a world audience. I note that Cooke, who passed through the fire, is soft and cuddly compared to Thomas Dixon Jr., author of BIRTH OF A NATION, who was four months old when they shot down Stuart."
3,Not the best,"If you own a BMW E46 3 series and need a pair of new lift supports for the trunk, save yourself some trouble and get the OEM Stabilus SG402043.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G63NQU/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThe StrongArm 4124 does not have quite enough lifting strength. You would have to use some extra force of your own arm to lift open the trunk lid. It does push the trunk lid all the way up once the lid has been lifted about a foot up, however it makes a weird loud noise while doing it. When closing the trunk, it would again not providing enough lifting strength once the trunk lid has got lower than about a foot from the bottom of the trunk opening, and the trunk lid would smash down.I then bought a pair of Stabilus supports and they have none of the problems above. They are just sweet."
5,Good Nails,"If you only need a few nails, this is the way to go. Received the product in good shape and had no problems at all."
2,"WARNING, SINATRA'S NOT LAST RECORDING!","This was recorded mid 1980's, except for 1994/3 pavaroti song, this is not sinatra's last live album, certainly not his 1995 birthday concert album, last time he had one, songs ok but nothing special, out of prime!"
5,Really good for later day Frank,"80th Live is a excellent collection of later day Sinatra in concert. Would have been nice for a few more songs to be included to make it longer but I will take the 14 they give along with the my way duet with Pavarotti, which is great. By the late 80's Frank was getting up there but really gives it all he has here. The overall sound quality is top notch with Sinatra in pretty good voice. A must for any sinatra fan.Peter J. Miller"
4,Maha powered multi-charger,"Haven't used the charger yet but looks like a great unit - good quality. Should save us a bundle of money not buying batteries every time we visit Costco! As always Amazon is great to order from - great prices, unbelievably fast shipping, excellent service.We order a lot through Amazon."
4,"NIce charger, design could use some work","I like this charger, nice display, I like the ""conditioning"" charge feature. I have charged more than 20 batteries, mostly AA & AAA. That is where my only complaint is, AA & AAA are harder to get in and out due to how recessed the slots for them are. I would have got the charger that was just for AA & AAA but I have several D & C batteries that I recharge, so this was a must for me."
1,A Disappointment,"I was very disappointed when I reviewed this book. It was almost as if the author(s) went to a search engine, and the NIH's Medline, and the National Library of Medicine (PubMed) did a search for IC then made a book out of the results. Of course, the problem with this is that that many of these listings will become (if they aren't already) outdated and ""old"" information. The book was apparently not reviewed by someone who has knowledge of the IC community, as it listed old and outdated addresses as well.In conclusion: In my opinion, just a few hours on the web ""today"" will yield more current and useful information than that provided by this book. For those seeking information on IC, I suggest a search on ""google.com"" instead.Jill O."
5,Nails,I felt it was a good deal only needed a box for a small project. Beats buying a case at Lowes for $90.
4,We always get this out for Christmas,"This little engine is so much fun -- Santa always gives us some new Brio pieces every year, and we have this little train to travel around the tracks.It is a PAIN to change the batteries -- the little smokestack screw needs to be aligned just so. It's something I can't just have my kids do (even though they are certainly big enough to change toy batteries by themselves in most other circumstances) -- I have to change them myself.This engine has trouble handling hills if it is pulling more than a couple of cars."
1,UNPROFESSIONAL!!!!!!!,"I bought the Pink Camouflage Peanut Hair Clipper Trimmer as a gift for someone close to me who makes there money by cutting hair. I bought it then got a email saying that the product was shipped and on its way to my friends house who I bought it for , I waited and the ship dates passed by and I never received the product. So after a weeks I finally filed a claim and and was reimbursed the money, ( WONDERING IF THE CLIPPERS WERE EVER SHIPPED IN THE FIRST PLACE!) Long story short I never received any product, then the person I bought them for gets a phone call at home asking her to remove the review that I left from my account. I do not know how the seller of this product got my friends number when I ordered it through my account, very unprofessional in my opinion. I do not recommend this seller to anyone."
1,It's a ZERO,"First time I used it three of the four tines broke off. If I did not have a friend with a PWC, my Seadoo would be out some where in the Atlantic right know. I do not suggest this item if you plan to use it in a strong current area."
3,To much trouble,I've waited since the late 80's for a good unicron to be made and I am still waiting. When transforming this goliath into planet mode it falls apart easily and has many parts that will easily be lost in a young childs hands.
5,UNICRON,WOW THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST TOYS OFF ALL TIME. NOT AS EXACTLY AS IN THE MOVIE. BUT (very) GOOD ANYWAY. BEST ARMADA TOY ALREADY. NOT ONE OF THEM CAN HOLD A CANDLE TO UNICRON THE TOY IS THE BOMB. WELL WORTH THE PRICE AT 49.99 GO OUT AND GET THIS TOY. LOOKS GREAT IN BOTH ROBOT AND PLANET MODE. A+
1,money not well spent,My five year old son desperatly wanted this toy for his 5th birthday. As requested we got it for him. My husband & I could not figure out how to make this unicorn guy into a sphere. This toy does not do anything!!!! The eyes light up but thats about it.He also does not stand up very well.
5,Awesome Stuff!,"My son had a yeast infection from medicine he was on for ear infection then got such terrible diaper rash he poor little butt was cracked and bleeding and it was the worst to try and change his diapers and the dr. kept telling me to keep thick layer of A&D on him, well I used to swear by A&D because it has always worked for me, not this time, it actually made it worse. So daycare suggested the ""butt paste"" and I tried it, oh my it cleared everything including the yeast infection in less than 24 hours. Thank you Dr. Boudreaux! I have a tube in every room in my house now. It it thick and pasty like peanut butter, and does not smell that bad actually, but it made my little guy feel much better!"
1,Disappointed,"I was attracted to the concept, I have a four year old daughter who is beginning to really enjoy poetry, but very disappointed with the execution. Some of the poems are well over the head of a 4-5 year old (I found them very un-inspiring), and other poems my daughter will interupt to correct the grammer (""Then is when I does feel a dread, Then is when I does jump into me bed"" - pg 13). This book could have been so much more. A definite don't buy (IMO). For the 4-5 year old age group try ""The Dragons Are Singing Tonight"", my daughter loves it."
1,No smell.,"I tryed this because of the good reviews, but was very disappointed. Smell is not very strong at all. Could not smell it in my hair at all. Waste of money."
2,Sweet? Not at all.,"This perfume was not at all what I expected. As other reviewers described it, it smells like vanilla, marshmallows, and cotton candy and those are lovely smells. And to remind you, the name of this perfume is Pink Sugar. However, it was dumb of me to purchase this fragrance without actually knowing what it smells like first, because as it turns out, the scent is not at all sweet, but spicy, rude and unpleasant. I don't understand the popularity of this product nor how anyone finds that to smell sweet."
5,Honestly Unforgettable...,"I was introduced to Pink Sugar by a friend years ago, and I have never forgotten it! Truly amazing and long-lasting fragrance that is unforgettable! Depressing how not many people know of Pink Sugar..."
4,Dont be clumsy!,"This product is truly awesome. I love the sweet smell, it covers up any hair product smells left behind. The only thing was i had one before and on a recent trip it was in my makeup case well packed, the case fell EVERYTHING in the case was perfectly fine except this product. The top part where the bottle connects to the sprayer snapped in half. But it was so great I purchased another one! So if you travel a lot i'd recommend packing it in a zip lock or something water proof to avoid breakage issues."
3,Just Okay,"I purchased this product because there were good reviews, but it does smell nice, very sweet if you like that kind of scent, and I do, but it does not last long enough. I'd say around a few hours and that's it. The only scent that REALLY lasts for me is Angel but I'd like to have some variety."
4,Fun and flirty!,I love this scent and the price is very affordable. It's great for daytime when wearing shorts or a sundress. My only complaint is that the scent doesn't last as long as I wish it did.
1,Strong alcohol smell at first,"I want to believe that this is the original product. However, the strong alcohol smells leads me to believe that this may be fake. I'm not sure why the AQUOLINA logo is MISSING! This is VERY suspicious!!!"
1,FAKE,I think this is fake. There isn't the brand name aquolina anywhere on the package. I'm very disappointed and upset. I can't believe I got tricked. The lady on the phone was very nice though when I called about it.
1,eh~,"i personally do not like it. if u like the smell of bakery on ur hair for hours, then go for it. it is quite long lasting tho."
1,could have been better,I received a tester. I was giving it as a gift and there was no lid. I would have liked to receive a complete bottle.
3,Good product but very slow shippment,"The product itself is pretty good. But I had to wait for a long time to get the package. This is supposed to be an Amazon Prime qualified product and I am supposed to get it in 2-3 days, but I ended up waiting for an additional week. I received no explanation of the delay from the seller either."
3,Shuga shuga in yer face!,"So, I'm over 38 (cough-cough) but not by much. And I've got a pink girly crush on Pink Sugar Hair Perfume. I have tons of long, thick, wavy hair and a few innocent squirts of this stuff at 8am I can still smell it at 5pm!Yummy, per the male co-workers, fwiw... I don't wear it for attention. I like smelling nice. Worth a few bucks to feel indulgent in a world where that's reserved for football players and such..."
5,love it,I just bought this from amazon and i absolutely love the scent of pink sugar. I wore it to work and 8 hrs later i could still smell it like if i have just put it on.i dont know much about notes and all those stuff i love it. i bought the cream also and it has the same long lasting experience as the perfume.try it you make like it i just tried it cause i wanted a new scent
2,Not the best,It takes quite a bit of movement to set this alarm off....on day three I found my cat curled up contentedly against it on the new sofa!
1,Didn't work,My cat jumped on the table and it didnt make a sound. When i banged the table really loud it did but my cat just looked at it.
2,Can't recommend if you have a BASEMENT,"Well... the product works... but way too well. We have a home built in 2010 and it is has a basement. The home is well built. We've never noticed vibration on the ground floor, but apparently the Tattle Tale definitely notices it. I can be 30 feet from it just walking normally and it will go off.So I really can't recommend this product if you have a basement and plan on using it on the ground floor or second floor of your home."
1,This Tattle Tale is a total waste of money,"My new kitten kept trying to get on a certain shelf in my kitchen. I thought no problem, I have this new Tattle Tale Product. I placed it on the shelf. Sure enough it went off. My kitten AND MY 6 YEAR OLD CAT... both back up a sort space and then got CLOSE TO SEE WHAT THIS NEW TOY IS. Please don't waste your money. I'm going to order SSSCAT because I know that works!!! I gave the Tattle Tale 1 star because of the design... The hole is handy to hang it up. That would be handy if it worked."
1,Not worth it!!!!,"I purchased this item to keep my cats off the counter. They would jump up on the counter and the alarm would not even go off. There were days I found them up there one was even laying right next to it. My cats aren't small so I cant see any reason why it shouldnt have done what it was suppose to do, only thing I can say was it was a waste of money."
1,"Didn't want, didn't use.","This item I didn't want, I wanted something to differ my cat off the table at night, NOT A DOG TRAINER THINGY.Tho when I had at out of the box and pointed at the cat, he jumped from a dead(forgive the pun) sleep."
2,Not for my cats!!,"Instead of fleeing in terror from the piercing sound of the alarm, my cats jumped up on the counter to investigate where the noise was coming from. May be good for pets who do not like loud noises."
4,AF-100 on GH400 Trimmer Edger,"The factory replacement spool for the GH400 Trimmer/Edger is the way to go. I have been very pleased with the easy to load and use spools. I have had bad luck with other trimmers, but this one is great with the factory replacement spool."
4,Price a bit high,"-Quick and fairly easy to install- Seems to be of good quality- Only option I know of for replacements for the B and D trimmer- Too expensive as someone already noted. The retail price is even more out there so I'm glad Amazon cuts the price in half, but still expensive per roll."
5,It is what it is,"What can I say? It's just replacement line for a trimmer. It was a pain getting the tape off of the spool, but once I did, it popped in easily and worked just fine.I bought these spools just to have a few extra spools hanging around. I will be using them with bulk line in the future to save some cash."
5,good product,I am impressed with the ease of operation of the Black & Decker cordless trimmer. This replacement spool is easy to install and is a good value.
1,Won't fit ST-5000,"Image on site appeared to indicate that this would fit the ST-5000 model electric trimmer; that's not the case.Return procedure surprisingly manageable, though, assuming that the credit shows up on my credit-card statement."
5,Finding a Voice in the West,"A moving critical study on those silences that confronted women artists in the West, focusing on professional, non-professional, and traditional women artists' struggles to find voices and to cope with markets for their work. Jensen discusses several artists whose careers were shadowed or distorted by husbands, some of whom were themselves artists or collectors. She also treats extensively the history of a Native American basket maker's struggles with market forces, traditional cultural artmaking and art-using practices, discrimination, and family forces. Covering late pioneer days through the rise of Hollywood and spanning painting, photography, literature, dance, and crafts, the book surprised me with its concise and compelling portrayals of many societies and art worlds. Jensen communicates immediate and personal interpretations of the ""lifeways"" of silenced and near silenced women artists, as well as some who succeeded--at their great cost--in finding a voice."
5,I laughed 'til I cried,"Bizarre behavior in a police department? and we always thought Cops didn't have a sense of humor ... This show is, from beginning to end, packed with excellent writing and even better ad-libbing. Non-stop nonsense!The cast blew me away--all virtal unknowns before this show, and yet so talented! It takes a natural brilliance to play ""dumb"" so well.Some of the can't-miss recurring issues in Season 2 include:~ Trudy falling in love with a serial killer~ A gay prisoner/leader of the gang the ""Grape Slushies""~ Dangle's wife (gasp! it's true)~ Some amazing PSAs by R. Williams~ Hospital visits that make you feel sorry for everyone involved~ Hilarious segments from traffic school~ The entire gang finally must pay the price for their actionsPerks to owning the DVD set:~ excellent deleted scenes~ a special segment from the 2004 Comedy Arts festival (whole cast onstage)~ no bleeps--you get to hear what they really say~ Come on, you'll have Reno 911 anytime of day!"
5,fabulous,"although son was starting to go downhill at this time, he really sounds great on this cd, especially the final track, ""john the revelator""."
3,King of the Delta Blues,"This CD will give you a better understanding of the roots of the Blues. Son House is said to be one of the three kings of the Delta Blues. If you like your blues a little more contemporary, as do I, then you may be a little disappointed. I am glad to have this CD to round out my collection a little more however, it not one that I will listen too often."
4,HEAVY BLUES,"THIS CD HAS A NICE VERSION OF ROCK YOU TO THE GROUND WITH GARY BARDEN ON VOCALS. BIJOU PLEASURETTE SOUNDS INTENSE AND POWERFUL. BUY THIS CD IF YOU ARE A COLLECTOR. OTHERWISE KEEP LISTENING TO STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT, BUDOKAN AND THE UNFORGIVEN WORLD TOUR LIVE CD'S."
3,I guess it works ok...,"My cpu isn't frying, so I guess it's working.... I haven't noticed a significant drop in cpu temps like so many other people claim to have with this product. I have used this on at least 5 processors too. I've tried different methods of applying this stuff and re-seating the HSF, but I never can get results that many other people claim to get."
5,Life saver,"I was cleaning my computer last week and I accidentally separated the heat sink from the processor. So the next course of action was to find what kind of thermal compound I needed. First thought was to go a certain store and by it. Decided against it for certain reasons and I eventually found this little guy, an absolute life-saver. The instructions for it are online and fortunately I hand a handy device to view it. Followed it to the letter and I'm getting temperature results of 24c when idling. I would suggest this product to every one of my friends for obvious reasons."
3,Heat convection,"There other products, even better product. If you are on a budget, then this compound works fine. If you can afford the more expensive, better heat transfer char, I would recommend it."
1,No reason to buy this paste,This is one of the most expensive pastes out there and its useless dont buy this just get the cheap one it works just as well as this.
3,ahhh,I'm not a fan my CO worker likes it but I guess I need more sugar. It does have a lot of protein and overall it's not really bad I just prefer ensure.
1,Total waste of time and money VERY EXPENSIVE,"I got this for weight loss... did nothing at all... NOTHING. It was worthless and I would not reccomend it... and the costs... I thought when I ordered it I was getting 24 cans... I got 12 no there had to be a mistake... I think I was ripped off... but this had too much sugar in it for weight controll or loss... and the taste was nasty. Not everything in the world is worth the money, and this was one of them."
4,Razor-edge slice of life...,"I admit I didn't know much about Andrea Dunbar before this; I watched it because of reviews and award-recognition. It's certainly powerful and disturbing, and all involved do not hesitate to show life as it is, in a most dismal and unforgiving locale. It's a very clever format, using Dunbar's words and experience to portray life on the ass-edge of the UK.""The Arbor"" is often hard to watch, and I admire it for the unflinching grit portrayed by actors and director. We have a situation that is prevalent in an area of the UK that has produced many artistic prodigies, but none as simple and unassuming as Ms. Dunbar. The differences among the 3 daughters are well defined, and I can't imagine how their bleak existence could be more powerfully displayed.Not pleasant, but definitely worth a look. The artistry is definitely complete and intact. I watched this last weekend, and it still resonates. A lesson for those who think they're at wit's end: Write a play."
1,Frozen Plug,"Besides the smell, which my wife does not appreciate, I really didn't have an opinion one way or the other as it seemed to work OK but not really any better than the generic blue wiper fluid. But when winter blew in, my opinion went from ""OK"" to ""Prestone, what the HECK were you thinking????"" I now have three cars with windshield reservoirs with frozen and unusable slush. Apparently Prestone saves money by not formulating the bug wash with anti-freeze and it froze on me - creating a challenging and dangerous situation.I WILL NEVER BUY BUG WASH AGAIN!!!!"
5,Anne Murray The Best,"I have a lot of CD's from many different artists and this has to be one of the best in terms of both content and delivery. Contains a lot of ""hit"" songs and a couple of the back-up songs are gems also. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a CD containing easy listening love songs."
5,and if I could you know that I would fly away with you,"Anne Murray has such a beautiful voice. My favorite song on this CD is ""Snow Bird."" It is such a beautiful melody. Some of my other favorite tracks on it are: ""Could I Have This Dance"" and ""Shadows In The Moonlight."" Ms. Murray is such a multi-talented contemporary country singer. It is shame that today's throw-away musicians don't have a tenth of the talent that Anne Murray has. The entire CD is a masterpiece."
5,Surprisingly touching and halarious!,"I honestly didn't expect it to be this good. They honestly could've released this in theatres. It's all very well done. One thing...get through the first 15 minutes! The first 15 minutes you get the sinking feeling this isn't really going to be that good, but once things are set into place, things take off and start to click. There are some very funny moments for any age viewer and some touching moments you won't see coming, but they have to do with friendship. ""Friends stick together 'til the end"". :) Well done Disney. What a nice surprise."
1,Pathetic Disney movie,"Anytime Disney releases a movie straight to video (not into movie theaters), it means that it is a half-baked effort, designed to make the greatest amount of money without care for the viewer. This is one of those. It's lame, stupid and badly animated. Walt Disney would be turning in his grave if he could see this.Skip it. This one must have been made by that most famous of Disney Dwarves: GREEDY"
4,4 Stars on the Strength of the Trailer,"Clever teaser trailer promises a smart and funny movie. The animation in the recent expanded trailer seems to try it's best to match the original, at least as much as it's limited budget probably allows.I also love the ingenious title. Unfortunatly changed in my native Britain to 'The Lion King 3 - Hakuna Matata' - ain't that a hoof in the head! Anything with Nathan Lane involved has gotta have some merit though."
4,Product ok. but our VCR died so we are not able to use it.,Tape is in perfect shape but we can only assume it works. Our VCR decided to die before we got to use it.
3,Rent it Before You Buy It,"We rented this DVD to test it, and we didn't like it enough to buy it. It recycles a LOT of footage from the original film, and the new material is pretty thin. The animation is pretty good for a direct-to-DVD film, and the original voice actors are back, but it doesn't have much of a story, and it doesn't really tell that much about the time that Simba spends growing up with Timon and Pumbaa. The first direct-to-video sequel, The Lion King II, is actually better, since it has a real story to tell.Your kids might be able to watch this one more than once, but you probably won't want to watch it with them. Rent it first and see what the family thinks of it before you bother to buy it!"
1,Lion King 1 1/2,The Lion King 1 1/2We paid the high price for this movie to make sure we received a new copy. However when we recieved the movie the 1st DVD has breaks/skips in it and the 2nd DVD would not play at all. We sent an email to see about returning the DVD but was informed that the company we purchased the DVD from was no longer taking emails. However the company still has these movies listed for sale on Amazon.com. Buyers be ware because the (new) movie we ordered and paid for is not watchable.
5,yep,"brand new, no scratches and plays perfect. the packaging was perfect as well. plus, the package came very fast. i was super excited when it arrived and worked as it should"
3,Just Okay,"The DVD itself was in great condition, I just didn't care the movie. The Lion King and Lion King 2 are much better than this one. I wou;dn't waste your money."
1,I'm sorry but nope!,I am a teen and I loved the original Lion King. Maybe just growing up and remembering the original movie made me biased about this film but I hated it. I thought it focused ay to much on Timon and Pumba's history and not enough on the original story.
1,To be honest,The movie might not have been that bad if they had just made a movie about Timon and Pumbaa's past WITHOUT involving them in everything from the first film. This movie completely ruined a perfectly majestic scene where the animals bow with crude humor. They might as well have flushed my childhood awe at that scene right down the toilet.
1,This is Horrid.,"May I add they just should have made a 3rd edition with Kiara and Kovu's cub and not this crap? I hated Timon and Pumbaa in the original LK stories and then this comes up.I mean you have to think of some of things that happened in this movie that makes it stupid, Timon and Pumbaa just went down a river in the pridelands and they were at the oasis, but Simba wondered around in a desert for weeks. What the hell happened? Then they all ran back through the desert to the pridelands. What's going on there? The meerkats were only afraid of Hyena's, but Mufasa made sure that they were never in the Pridelands. Among other things wrong with this movie.Only thing good about the movie was kawaii little Simba.And the more disturbing thing was Timon and Pumbaa kissed. O.o I'm all for Yaoi moments and I know the dude who did Timon's voice is gay but still it was scary.This was the most stupiest 'sequel' Disney has ever come up with. Don't bother buying it."
1,disappointed,"I expected more from this book. I wanted a book that was written for designers but instead got a book written in engineer-speak with a nice cover (although for the price a hard cover would have been nice). the illustrations look like they are straight out of any other engineering text. ""A"" for concept, ""D"" for content. Having said that, there aren't a lot of books to choose from for ID - this may be the best - ... ."
5,The best i've ever used,"I love this smoker!!! Talk about easy set up, and easy to use, If you have never had a smoker this is a GREAT buy, smoking is so easy and the flavor you get from it is out of this world."
3,Read the Label,"Horsetail is not safe during pregnant. Some might argue that Stinging Nettle isn't safe either. I did not expect these extra herbs, and only realized that something else was in these pills after I opened the bottle and smelt them.I'm still on the hunt for a good (preferable food based) calcium that I can take while pregnant/ nursing.On a good note- the expiration date is long, so maybe I will be able to use them... one day."
1,What is the point of this book?,"This book was recommended to me and I bought it. I have no idea what the point of this book is...it's just a bunch of tweaked out pictures. I thought it was...well, I don't know what I was thinking. I wasted ten bucks."
1,Delivery Failure,I have been waiting for 3 weeks and still have not received the book A First Course in Mathematical Modeling.Thank You!Vic
2,LOUD!,"""It's Bed Time"" tells a story about a little brother and sister going to bed and the steps involved in bedtime -- cleaning up toys, taking a bath, brushing teeth, etc. It even includes a bedtime chart in the back. But there are a couple of problems, one being that I see Amazon says the suggested age range is 4-8. As the mother of a 3-year-old, I think this book is much better suited to ages 2-5. Most annoying, though, is the electronic recording of ""Lullabye and Goodnight"" included with the book, which is so painfully loud to hear that I cannot believe that it wouldn't be damaging to a little one's ears. The volume is just about right when my hand is pressed tight over the speaker, otherwise it's just too loud."
3,Good but not great.,"While this beats filling bags by hand, some things should be noted.1. The bag doesn't secure well to rectangular containers. The drawstring isn't elastic and doesn't provide the 'grip' needed to hold the bag on. The hose is heavy enough to pull the fabric top off the can. I use small hand clamps on each corner...relatively quick and easy fix. I considered bungees but clamps are just as effective...but use care in attaching them...the cover fabric looks like it can easily tear.2. Watch out for sticks and twigs...and wet leaves...these easily clog up the works.3. The plastic twist locking device that secures the hose to the vacuum port works itself loose frequently.4. For me, the real advantage isn't that the vacuum picks up the leaves...it's that it mulches them too. I could hand bag the leaves just as fast, but I would need at least twice the number of bags (or more).Overall...an OK system as long as you can find a way to keep the bag on the can."
4,Huge Improvement over original bag,"This is a huge improvement over original collector bag. There is a learning curve to attaching it to a trashcan but it was not too difficult. Glad that I bought it, definitely worth the price."
2,Overpriced,"Although the product works at about 60% efficiency, it is definitely overpriced and difficult to maneuver with the barrel attached. MAYBE at half the price one could learn to live with it !"
3,good just what I needed,worked ok but had a hard time keeping it on wanted to blow off all the time. used 4 pinch clamps to solve the problem
3,B & D BV-006 Blower/Vacuum leaf collection system,I have not tried it out yet. It appears that this could be a time saver. It's been to cold to actually use it.
3,Black & Decker bv-006 Blower/Vacuum leaf collection system,"Good product, but the hose length could be a bit longer. When in use you feel as if you need two people to operate the clean up process because you have to keep stopping to move the collection can/container.Also, it needs a slightly better system to keep the system secured to a collection can/container."
3,A little easier than the shoulder bag,"Fills a garbage can in about 10 minutes - lasting about 3 times longer than the shoulder bag. It's also easier on the back since it dumps into the can instead of filling the bag on your shoulder. The hose is long enough to move around the can as it fills as long as you blow all your leaves into a manageable pile. Otherwise, you have to drag the can along with you around the yard. The worst part about it (which I wish they would fix) is the thin static line that needs to be tightened to hold the fabric to the garbage can. It's a pain to align it in the grove of the can and to be sure it'll tighten or it'll blow off along with all your leaves. I wish it was made of some bungee-like material that would secure it well and be easier to fit by yourself."
4,Time on your hands?,"I have a rather large, corner lot with a lot of leaves. This works well if you are not in a hurry. It works very well in a sunken contrete patio area that collects leaves, vacuuming it all up well. But for clearing a large lot efficiently, it takes too long."
1,Disappointed,"This system works best for small jobs. I found the fabric top kept getting twisted and required a lot of energy and time to keep it from twisting. I should have returned it. When it worked well, it filled-up the barrel so quickly, I spent more time putting the fabric top back on than I did emptying the barrel. If you have a lot of leaves, the fastest way to get them up is rake them onto a tarp and with the help of another person, load them into a trailer."
4,Great time saver,"This system is fantastic compared to the shoulder bag. Like some of the other reviews have mentioned the fabric cover is made for a square garbage can. Once you get the cover secured over the can and with a little practice removing and replacing it becomes a 1 minute job.I have a large yard with many trees so mixed in with my leaves I usually have plenty of sticks. While the my leaf vacuum does a good job of chewing them up they got to be a little much for the tube on this product. I punched a couple holes in it, but those were patched with duct tape. I would go easy on the amount of stick you suck up, but other than that this is a fantastic product."
2,Older version was better,"I replaced my old worn out leaf collection system with the new one. Instead of improvements, I found the elastic band that holds the bonnet to the hose is weaker than the old one and comes off easier. The cord that secures the bonnet to the trash container you are collecting leaves in does not lock as well as the old, either."
4,Works with my Craftsman Gas Blower too!,"With a very easy modification, I was able to use this on my Craftsman Gas Leaf Blower. The fitting that attaches to the leaf blower has a tab(s) for the Black and Decker Blowers. By removing the tab(s) with a small saw or sharp knife, it now fits my Craftsman blower. I have plastic square garbage cans and the unit fit fine. I had to make sure the string tie was below the bottom edge of where the lid snaps on. Creates lots of fine dust during the process of multching...So obviously stand up wind :)"
2,Not What You'd Expect,I was hopeful this unit would work great and save some money. However after about ten minutes the mesh bag around the hose which creates the airflow clogged and of course the flexible tube clogged soon after. I did clear this out and it worked for a little bit more but than the same situation. For the small area I was clearing it left much to be desired. Another issue is the hose is short and the garbage can (unless you put cinder blocks inside) tended to fall over a lot.Black & Decker Blower/Vacuum Leaf Collection System #BV-006
3,"GREAT Idea, Material Could Be Better","I LOVED this when we first got it, but the hose is plastic (a thin plastic). Leaves are plentiful in our yard, so this was the PERFECT solution. Unfortunately, when you have a lot of leaves, there are also a lot of small twigs mixed in. The twigs punctured holes in the hose making the system unusable."
3,Interested in early Queen?,"FYI - if it's early Queen you're interested in - you know, stuff before that lemon of an album ""Bicycle Races"" - I urge you to buy the original albums (starting with ""Day at the Races""). Anthology/compilations omit far too much worthwhile material."
4,How can you not love Queen?,"Wonderful. A must have for Queen fans, or people who just want some fun music. This CD is a little more emotional than the ""Best of Queen"" CD."
4,Great but does not fit my 8215 edger,The blade came in a well packaged and in a timely manner. I took a chance that it would fit the Black Decker Model 8215 but the blade was too long for my edger.
1,A great work of fiction,This book is purely speculative and uses no logic whatsoever. I refuse to break it all down for you I only encourage each of you to use your brain and shed your infantile fear of death.
5,Great Stuff!,"Hard to find in stores, but this product is a great light spray-in and blow dry leave-in conditioner. I have straight fine hair and it works very well."
5,excellent neck rest Pillow,Travel Accessories Lewis N. Clark Mood Neck Rest PillowI tottaly enjoyed the Neck rest pillow on my long flights
3,"Not as brilliant as Discipline and Punish, but still the work of a powerful thinker","It's a bit drier and it lacks the really sharp style of Discipline and Punish, especially in the beginning, but his observations and analysis, coupled with his rigorous historical method are still just as nuanced. The interesting thing about this is that you can really see how his system of thought coalesces by the end of it and how he would go on to apply it to a broader social context."
2,Just yuck,"This book was just too gritty for me, I enjoyed reading these types of books when I was younger but not anymore."
3,Aftermarket item works well but not as sturdy as the original,"I had doubts about buying an aftermarket part not produced by the original manufacturer; however, this item works well. The fitting is not quite as snug which means the bag will disconnect occasionally from the unit (which can get messy)but all in all, it works and is not too pricey.Major disappointment is that the seam - after less than one full season of use began to come apart - took it to a shoe repair shop for re-stiching"
1,Not as described,"When I did my search for a replacement bag for my leaf vaccum this item was displayed. The price was good so I ordered two so I could continue vaccuming while someone else emptied the bag to save time. When the bags arrived they were not compatible with my leaf vac, I had to pay $10.07 for return postage and the company deducted a restocking fee on top of that. Still waiting on my refund. Buyer beware and do more research before ordering."
1,black n deckers blower bag replacement,"works great, glad it was available. good price. product was what I was looking for and was able to receive it in a timely matter. Would buy again if I needed too."
1,Replacement Bag,"This is a very poor quality replacement bag. I didn't want to buy a new blower/vacuum so I ordered the bag in spite of other negative reviews. The zipper is not nearly strong enough for the tough wear it gets. The bag is also not stitched well so my old one ripped above the zipper end. In addition, for some reason inserting and removing the bag is almost impossible so I end up dragging the whole machine to a disposal point. I tried spraying it with silicone spray which worked once and then was just as difficult to remove. When this bag wears out (which will probably not be long), I will buy a new machine and it won't be Black & Decker!"
4,Leaf Blower Bag,"I have gone through many blower bags and this is the most inexpensivereplacement bag I have found. You can turn the bag inside out and take off the plastic ties and use this on another model blower. Replace the plastic ties over your model blowers fitting and you have a cheap replacement bag. This bag does not drag on the floor, so you won't weara hole in it. The zipper doesn't come off the track or bind as much as some other bags."
1,Collection Bag,The zipper on this bag is very low quality. It broke after 1 years use. The cost of the bag is close to 1/2 the cost of the complete unit.
3,"Four seasons, two bags","The original bag that came with the system lasted all of one season. I didn't even have the usual problem most people have with the zipper - my bag literally ROTTED. When I came back to the tool shed in the spring to get it, there were holes in the bag! I purchased the replacement bag in spring of '09 and it has thus far lasted two seasons, although it is showing signs of wear and tear. No problems with the actual leaf blower/vacuum, but the bag it a money pit!"
3,B&D Replacement Collection Bag,"The bag itself is nice, but the neck design ought to be reworked. The bag can collapse at times, upon it's neck and make it impossible to fill."
1,This bag blows (out),"I like the blower/vac that the bag attaches to just fine. However, the bag is [garbage]. Threads on the inside began unraveling on the first use. The zipper is low quality. The major defect was that the bag ripped open around one of the reinforced areas where the bag handle is sewn to the bag. The bag was then useless - and made a heck of a mess, blowing debris on me when it blew. I had only filled the bag a few times when it blew, and it was kept relatively clean, so air could pass through the bag reasonably well. There should be a recall on these bags because not having a good quality bag makes the vacuum feature worthless."
2,"Nice small size, but flimsy","I ordered this item because of its small size. The diameter is good and if you experience pain with larger sizes, this one is for you. It has strong vibration. The problem is that the end to turn it on is also the end where the batteries go. It is not designed well, so if you aren't extremely careful, the end pops off, so the batteries aren't connected, therefore, no vibration."
2,don't waste your money,I purchased this for my son last christmas. The center itself is pretty sturdy but that is the only good thing about it. The drawers are hard to get in and out. The tray where the T.V. sits in starting to sink in the middle. I bought this brand new. If I had it to do all over again I would not buy this item.
3,They tried but failed...,"It's a story of nazi scientist who works on secret weapon using human mental forces. After dying in one of the experiments he (or his soul) discovers that all the things he's been doing were evil and that therefore he's a sinner now and wiil have to pay for it. He turns to the good side...That could be better if it wasn't so naive. One can see authors' efforts to make the comic at least a bit ambitious but it's a failure. Artist can't decide if he's himself, Mignola or Darrow, however there are a few intresting narrative tricks that save the whole book from getting less than 3 stars.Anyway, rather dissapointing."
1,Will not Play on Some Standard DVD Players,"BE WARNED: This DVD will not play on my standard Sony DVD player even though Amazon describes it as ""Region: Region 1 (U.S. and Canada only.)"" The reason is that it is in PAL format. So dig through the fine print in your DVD player manual to make sure that it will play PAL format before you buy this DVD. My Region 1 Sony will play NTSC only, so it will not play it."
2,one for each good memory...,"Ah, it is shameful to love this pop-wanna-be-hard-rock pretty boy. AT LEAST half of the songs on this CD could be smitten from known recorded music and never missed, but I do have to admit I like In The Dark and My Kind of Lover enough to have bought this. If these two songs make you reminisce fondly on that kind of 80's [crud], this is work picking up off the [...] bargain rack for a cheesy road trip sing-a-long. If not, don't bother..."
4,Flask,"I purchased this for my brothers birthday.It was exactly as pictured,in great condition when it got to me and it was sent out very quickly."
4,Really enjoyed this one!,"Not the best movie ever, but it is cute and is funny. This is a chick-flick, so guys would probably not like this one. The basis of the story is that Brittany Snow plays ""kat""...or is it ""kate.."" a girl who feels anonymous to everyone. Then she moves of course to a new town where no one knows her until she gets in the middle of a fight with 3 girls who claim their dating John Tucker. All the girls are upset and Kate tells them she would ""get even"" and that is exactly what they do. The only bummer about the movie to me is the ending...not exactly how I expected it, yet it wasn't totally depressing.Basically if you liked movies such as ""Mean Girls"", ""Clueless"", ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"". etc.. you'll enjoy this movie."
4,amusing movie,This is definitely the kind of movie for women who get pissed off at players - and who could blame them? It's about time the players got played with.
2,This is cinematic kitsch,This is a very typical teen movie.The most that I would be willing to part with for this (with the benefit of hindsight) is about $3.It's worth a rental if and only if you aren't in the mood to watch a very serious movie.
4,FUN SUMMER FLICK. JUST ONE COMPLAINT.,"I caught a matinee showing of ""JTMD"". It was a terrific summer teen film all-the-way. Until the climax at Tucker's b-day party. It seemed pointless and stupid with an all-out foodfight. Anybody agree??? Buy a ticket and see the movie anyway."
3,Haha. Pretty silly fun. 3.6 stars.,"Ashanti was thick and pretty as usual. The main character Jesse was a straight up player but cute and multi-talented. The girl that ""got even"" with him was good too.I loved the first volleyball game in the gym. Everyone smackin' beyotches and throwing balls at people's faces. No one was safe. Nope. None of that!The ending was pretty lame and Jesse didn't really get what he deserved. He got all the sex, all the love and attention. All the kisses that he didn't deserve and too many freebies to count.But the girls got even - more or less, and watching him emote all of these feelings during the basketball game was hilarious.Rent it or borrow it from a friend.3.6 stars."
3,Not the best.....but enjoyable!,"I really liked this movie, eventhough the ending was trippin. Some of the lines are......mediocre. The acting was okay but could have been better. Overall a light, funny, enjoyable comedy. Worth a view or 2. Also this movie has a very good looking cast ;)"
5,Edger Hog blade replacement.,"I bought a used Edger Hog edger and these are the OEM replacement blades. Didn't realize you can get these things just about any where. But, hey, they were competively priced and I saved myself some gas money."
5,Great edger!,I'm very satisfied with this edger. Highly recommend it to anyone.Found the best price at Amazon.com as I usually do when shopping.
1,Not what it appears to be,"The picture shown for the part is not accurate. The part you sent me has a round hole for mounting in the center. The picture shows one that is 'saturn' shaped, like the one that is on my edger. So, I have purchased a part that I cannot use."
1,Cotton candy maker,This product is a parents worst nightmare. Its messy smells terrible and broke on the first use.Its best that you get your cotton candy fix at the circus.
1,The Toy That didn't Work,I tried it over and over again and it didnt work the cotton candy kept melting and clogging the place where the cotton candy comes out of and it always gets to hot even when its only been on for 5 minutes.
4,Excellent,"My daughter wants this cotton candy machine as a Christmas gift, so I bought it for her and it is excellent. We try it today and it is perfect. Obviously that this a toy and you can't pretend to make a lot of cotton candies."
4,Give this book to someone you love,"I disagree with the majority of reviews writen about this book. This rendition of a ""personal experience"" journal is meant to be read and enjoyed with your family, friends, children. For those of us who have older parents, those we love with early mental conditions, even friends with incurable diseases, what better way to have them usher in the new year, and leave for us in the future a record of remembrances. Some people may be intimidated when confronted with a ""journal"", this book is the opposite; fun, conversation, memories."
5,Great CD,"This is a fine CD. The arrangements are lovely and well-played.My only quibble is that theplaying time is 34 minutes. I wish it was longer, butthe quality of the playing is so good that I can'tbring myself to deduct points for thisIt's a shame this cd doesn't have audio samples onits Amazon page. I was lucky enough to come across TomPoore's web site, which has audio samples of all thecarols, so I had a good idea what I was getting when Iordered it"
2,Disappointment,"This CD was a bit of a disappointment. Don't let the other reviews fool you. For amateur musicians they are pretty decent, and if I was attending a local small town concert I would have rated it as a nice performance. However, A high quality recording of an impressive instrumental performance this is definately NOT. By my humble ear, I heard off-tempo and off-key notes throughout the various numbers. The recording itself was of modest quality as well. No offense to the artists, they perform much better than I could ever come close to, but I was mislead into thinking this would be a much higher quality musical CD by the other reviews. Maybe what others interpreted as ""whimsey"", I interpreted as poor quality, not to my liking."
3,Tough Time Climbing this Hill,"Not his best effort, but it still has its appeal. An attempt to straddle the more commercially attractive mainstream and the free jazz that was in vogue at the time. The net result is a somewhat understated recording that lacks a clear direction which is really atypical of Hill's music.Blue Note/Andrew Hill completists will want to add this to their collection, but for the rest who want representative works by Hill, they're better served by picking up Hill sides like ""Point of Departure"" or ""Judgement"". Of course the Rudy Van G remastering is of the highest standard.One consumer note. Charging nearly $50.00 for a new copy of this CD borders on the obscene insofar as you can still pick up a fresh one at Mosaic for about $13.00---but act soon if you want it! It's being phased out of their catalog."
2,"Not ""Mesmer""izing...",This book is a complete mess and at 167 pages too long. I am surprised at my self for even finishing it. The plot is all over the place and incoherent. Characters not developed at all. Half the time I had no idea what was taking place.
2,Kind of a letdown.,"I was given to understand that this album was a big-band cover of all the songs in Paul McCartney's ""Ram,"" which has long been one of my favorites (and I'm not a huge McCartney fan at all). But it's not really that. It's more of a lyrics-free version of the same album. You still have the Spectorish ethereal chorus in the background, and guitars, ukeleles, and other instruments that you'd not ordinarily find in either an orchestra or a big band. I think I'd have enjoyed this CD all the more if it had really been an orchestral or band transcription, instead of a neither-fish-nor-fowl as this is."
3,Ram Goes Classical,"This CD is probably Paul's most obscure piece of work, along with Press To Play. Many of Paul's fans (and music reviewers) forget about these 2 cd's when going over Paul's catalog. The CD has a pleasant enough vibe. Truth be told this is one I haven't listened to in a long time. I know that the CD reminds me of something you might hear as background music at Barnes and Noble, or some other book store. Overall, it's nice that Paul did this. It's also puzzling he chose to release this in 1977, which was a full 6 years after Ram. Thrillington is for Paul completsits only. Save this as one of your last cd's and I would recommend Wingspan as a good first place to start."
2,Just because it's Macca ??!! No way !!,"I'm a huge McCartney fan, having own the whole Beatles, Wings and his solo catalogue until ""Flowers In The Dirt"". But this is.....this is just NOT Macca !! I've been searching for this rare item for years, and when I got hold of it, I was flat out disappointed. This is not even Paul himself. He had no part in this, except providing the songs and producing this load of instrumentals. As the CD jacket does not reveal any musician credits, I assume he did not play any instrument nor sing in this album. Though I must admit that the instrumentals are kinda interesting, not bad.....but no point adding to your Macca collection."
3,More direct than usual,"This little book tries to bypass poetry and offer a practical, step-by-step program for realizing the identity of subject and object. The author even goes so far as to provide his basic instruction worded 26 different ways, in the hope that one of the wordings will resonate with you.The author makes some rather bold claims that will challenge many readers. He categorically denies the need for any sort of teacher. He also dismisses thousands of years of spiritual advice in all traditions as either insufficient or useless. Neither of these provocative claims is really relevant to the technique he is presenting. The book would be better without them.And what is Langford's technique? The Chinese classic ""Secret of the Golden Flower"" calls it Turning the Light Around. But I've never seen it presented as forcefully or as urgently as this.Recommended if you find your practice lapsing, and need your hair set on fire."
3,nice mug - bad smell,"as someone else mentioned, there is a plasticky creepy smell which made me sick to my stomach. A little investigation revealed the source of the smell is the two white soft-plastic sealing O-rings. The other reviewer mentioned that the smell dissappated after a few weeks (!), and I'm hoping the same will happen for me. Until then I really find it unusable cuz it makes me sick and ruins the drink in the mug; its that overpowering. I've scrubbed removed and scrubbed the rings with detergent but so far they smell as strong as ever.UPDATE: It took 5 full days of airing out the rings on the kitchen table before the smell dissipated. But once back in the mug, presumably from the closed space inside, it reappeared. Might return it."
1,The Rattler,"This looked like a good product and a great match for the Snowball microphone. However, upon fastening the Snowball to the center ring microphone mount, I noticed a rattling noise anytime the assembly was moved. Turned out the metal bracket that the microphone mounts to was wobbly in the center (isolated) ring and would make a rattling sound if the shockmount was moved in the slightest. Tightening the screws that hold the mount to the inner ring seemed like a good idea except that the design kept things from clamping tighter together. Adding shims would have solved the problem but seems inappropriate given the price of this shockmount.Since zero stars is not an option, I rate this product a one star and have returned it."
5,Great service & great product,"I've had my ringer for a long time now. I love the performance is offers in my podcasting. I, like others had the thumb screw break... Not an issue! I went to BLUE's web site, filled out a customer service request form and without asking they sent a new thumb screw fed-ex at not cost! What service!!! The new thumb screw is not the same soft metal and should never again be an issue. The Snowball is a great Mic, the Ringer is a great shockmount and BLUE's service is first rate."
2,Doesn't handle the weight of the Blue Snowball microphone,"I picked this up along with the Blue Snowball microphone and I'm quite disappointed. It's made of solid construction, but the locking mechanism is terrible. It won't hold the weight of the Blue Snowball microphone and after twice watching my mic smack the table due to the lock mechanism slipping, I refuse to use it anymore.Also, when I was taking the Snowball out, it was a little hard to unthread it due to how the thread mechanism works. If you try it, DO NOT tighten the Snowball down very much or you'll have an awful time trying to get it back out.Overall I can't recommend the product, at least for the Snowball. It looks great, feels great, but it can't handle the weight of the Snowball reliably."
3,I have mixed feelings,"The structural aspect is very iffy. The bearings become loose often, and are hard to adjust. This product is VERY heavy. The material, though, is very forgiving if dropped. You can tell from the get-go that this is a strong product. I would not recommend this to anyone owning a blue snowball unless you are a serious recorder."
3,It broke on the way.,"I bought it for my blue microphone but when I got it, the neck was bent and no matter how I tighten it, it won't stand correctly. I'm incredibly disappointed because it cost me an arm to get that. Be careful with it, that's all I'm going to tell you guys. Aside from that, a straight working one is pretty much awesome to use with a microphone stand. It may look like a stupid purchase but it comes in handy!"
1,Looks awesome - thumb screw BAAAAD.,"I had the same experience as at least two of the other reviewers here.Used the thumbscrew a whopping 3 times, and the tab broke right off. Soft metal, bad weld.Now, the only way I can use it is to hang it upside-down from a boom stand."
4,Nice!,A classic and AFFORDABLE pair of shoes. Very nice. I can wear them all day and my feet don't complain.
2,"Pretty Portraits, but not much else...","Some outstanding portraits, but very little insight into how to do it. If you can learn by observing others' works, alone, you can learn from this book. Otherwise, there are lots of other books available that include solid information on the techniques needed to do work like this. Most of the photos are accompanied by a short blurb of data on the camera, lens, film, shutter and exposure used, which is invaluable to the knowledgeable photographer, but probably useless to the snapshooter and auto/digital user."
2,Big Disappointment,"What a disappointment! This is not a book about boat canvas, this is a book about sewing arts and crafts in canvas on a boat. Projects include ""A simple duffel bag"", a ""Life Jacket Bag"", a ""Bicycle Bag""; and under ""Interior"" are projects like ""Sheets and Quilts"" and ""Curtains"". There is some discussion of exterior boat canvas, but the information is cursory and focused on sailboats. If you want to increase your knowledge of boat canvas before laying down a few thousand dollars to have new canvas made for your boat, this book will not help you."
2,Not what you think,"I was pretty disappointed by this book. Anything with ""Big Book"" in the title should be very comprehensive, instead this is an out of date, amateur attempt that has somehow lasted all these years, probably the title.If you need a serious technical book on how to layout canvas detailing the complex process required to ensure a professional quality result, this is not the right book. If you want to build canvas duffel bags and other meaningless items, then maybe."
1,horrible,"I don't like to really be negative in general in my life, but I feel I must truly warn those out there who think this is a slick well-polished instructional video, to take a second look at all these comments. This video looks like and was probably shot in the early 80's with home video cameras. It is not interesting nor is it very good at teaching, and the films it shows you how to aspire to are really cheap B-movies that wouldn't sell in the $1 DVD bin at Walmart. Time to retire this old video and take it off the search engines. Steer clear filmmakers..."
5,Worth every penny....,"I must admit that I was very impressed with this product when I got it. I love it and am hooked on it.... The amazing part is how cheap it is. If you love the phoenix. This is no doubt... The best thing to wear..... But you should but another chain for it, after wearing it two days my neck turned green. But the pendent on it is amazing.... Worth buying"
3,good but not great,"size ordered was just great,good shoe but not as good as nb811 right shoe does not close as good as left"
2,Not what I expected,"I purchased this model and brand of shoes after reading recomendations from previous buyers to my disappointment.What was wrong ?1. I purchased the shoes a half size bigger and wider than I normally wear because previous buyers stated Propets shoes ran a little smaller than their stated size, not the case with mine so their to big.2. The shoes make a lot of stretching noises when I wear them drawing unwanted attention.3. The shoes do not breath and my feet get hot after wearing them a short time.4. Poor foot support and heavier than I expected.Previously I had New Balance brand shoes because their one of the few brands you can buy along with Propet in a 4X wide.The New Balance shoes were far better made, lighter and supported much better and breathe.If your like me and need to wear 4X wide shoes I highly recommend you purchase New Balance brand instead just like my next shoe purchase will be."
3,Just okay,"Not as comfortable as I expected. Very hard construction.does not flex that much. It was definitely wide, like I wanted."
3,size seems small,bought two different make shoes and these seem tighter than the other pair. They are light on the feet and do feel secure.
5,Propet shoes,I am very satisfied with my propet shoes. I need the extra wide size 5E because of feet swelling. This is my fourthpair of propet shoes.
2,Mislabeled tracks,"No complaint about the performance, but most of the tracks are mislabeled, and I had to ask for a refund."
4,LOVE THE ANIME bad disc,its a great show ... iv been folowing it for a verry long time now and i bought this to add to my colection just bc its my fave season but right arount when renji unleashes his banki it glitches and freezes which sucks bc the begining of kempachi's fight with captian tozen starts right in the middle of the glitch which is EXTREAMLY FRUSTRATING but all in all its a great series and i highly recomend it for all anime fans!!!
2,CD not in Stereo,"The quality of the music on this CD is not very good because the music is not recorded in stereo. Although the songs on the CD are great I would strongly suggest buying other Harry Belafonte CDs that are recorded in stereo such as ""The Very Best of Harry Belafonte""."
3,"Its ok, nothing spectacular....","Well this book had some cool pictures, some interesting spells and chant to try, but its not spectacular. Has rituals that she just revised from tradition gardanerian practices. Just mumbo jumbo, i read out of curiosity, dont let it be your first magic book. Actually the book burned in the bon fire, because my spouse thought it was evil, and actually i couldnt say i miss it."
1,A little thing called common sense,"I appreciated many of the ideas. Then I reached rules 6-8 of the 8-fold path and decided I'm not looney enough to try ritual sex, blood rituals or rituals involving recreational drugs involving waking up in Tijuana next to a lizard dressed as Jimmy Hendrix. Sorry guys, Gardnerian Wicca is just not for everyone."
5,Influential,"Death be not Proud is a one of a kind book. Through the use of great language and eloquence, John Gunther instills within one a message of selflessness and struggle.The book is primarily centered around a boy who develops a life threatening brain tumor which alters his life for the worse. Despite the alteration, the boy continues to push forward and maintains great composure as if nothing happened to him. From the very onset of the brain tumor, Johnny always tried to relieve others of grief - a strong act of selflessness. This along with his other venerable qualities are touching and very influential. Once one understands what the boy has been through, one realizes that life is precious and full of many pitfalls and obstacles. Although the book has a lot of sadness attached to it, it does not obstruct the flow of the book - it only adds on.Read the book and I'm sure it will keep you flipping pages!"
3,Death Be Not Proud,I had heard about this book and decided to get a copy to read. Ifound it meaningful. It arrived on time and in good condition.
3,It was kinda slow...,"I agree that the book was beautifully written, and I felt the parent's pain, but I felt it was sort of slow moving."
4,death be not proud,"Death be not proudThis novel is based on a true story about a boy learning that he is sick. Not just the flew kind of sick but he has a disease which is referred to as cancer. Throughout the book the author who is also the boy's father is describing his struggles, fights, and courage throughout his fight for survival to beat his cancer. The novel was very sad in my opinion to read the exact or somewhat exact details of what someone with a disease thinks feel and has to deal with. I find it amazing that someone who is basically been told that they have no hope keeps fighting to get every breath out of life.By: tiffany kless"
2,To die does not make perfect,"While Death Be Not Proud was very sad, I could not feel a connection with the characters. Johnny seems to be remembered in death far beyond what he was in life. The way in which this book was written made me feel like I could not be worth anything unless I die in a tragic manner. If you do not have an overabundance of self-confidence, I would not recommend reading this book."
2,NO-GO!,"The premise or this story was great....two sisters falling for one man. But this was the most boring and dramatic book I've ever read. I thought this would be a good-read because I read ""Garden of Lies"" which was great. I don't think this book needed to be more than 300pgs, but considering all the descriptions of the boring characters, that took up the other 300pgs. I am an avid reader, and this book was not worth it. It took me almost two months to complete because I couldn't stand it!"
5,Chicago's bringing in reinforcements,"In the war of where ""real"" hip-hop resides, Chi-Town MC LongShot, like other hungry MC's in the underground circuit, is trying to change the likes of Hip-Hop music while trying to make ends meet. Title matches the album perfectly... Sacrifice goes a Long way. No major names hear... just raw lyrics and some dope beats"
2,too slow for today's style,"A remake of ""I Soliti Ignoti"" [""Big Deal on Madonna Street""], a Mario Monicelli masterpiece of italian cinema made almost 50 years ago, this plot takes place in a inner-city industrial urban neighborhood of Cleveland. Having seen the italian original, it is remarkable how the same characters are cloned to modern-day cleveland. For example, the uptight and old-fashioned Michele from Sicily is now a stylish afro-american that could be a pimp. But while the original had a beat to it that engaged the story to evolve from one scene to the next, as a good page-turner book would do, this remake languished. The original had a really good musical beat that acted as a ""page turner"". This one does not. Too bad: we need more independent and local film production, but more post-production here would have helped, also to speed up the pace in today's even-more accelerating expectations from the audience."
4,Good buy,"I was tepid about this item, I waited for almost a month before I bought one. I checked every web site, read every review, and calculated how much I could spend. I got mine today and it has been a really good buy. It took me about 20 minutes to put it together(you need 2 11mm wrenches) and I was off and cutting my lawn. The manual says that it the cutting blade is already set at the factory but you may find that you may have to done some tweaking of your own to get the cut that you want. It's not that heavy either, and pushing it, you will get a good work out!! I think I made a good buy."
5,No Gas Needed!!!,Works wonderfully on our small yard. No more fumes or struggling to get a mower started. No gas needed!! The only problem I've encountered is that you have to be careful not to pick up small sticks as these have a tendency to catch in the blades.
2,Heavy and unwieldy,"A small push mower should be just the ticket for small manageable yards. This model, however, is far heavier than it needs to be and is difficult to maneuver in tight corners. It also tends to do wheelies when backing up, gouging the lawn with the catcher clips and dumping the catcher contents everywhere.To its credit, the bearings and the blades seem very rust resistant. If you like to mow in the rain or you're one to forget your tools outside, you may want to give this one some thought.I retired this model after its first summer, picked up a neolithic push mower at a neighbor's garage sale, and am far more satisfied."
5,Mowing clean and quick!,"I have a 40'x50' yard with a slight uphill grade and I found this mower to be perfect for my needs. I have by no stretch of the imagination a 'perfect' lawn, I just want to be able to keep the grass at a manageable height. On average it takes me about 15 minutes to mow my lawn and I suspect it would go more quickly if I didn't have to navigate around my fire pit.Quiet, clean, efficient, effective - if you can walk, you can mow. I love that I can mow whenever I want without disturbing my neighbors!"
3,The Good Word On Wine,Bruce Cass and Jancis Robinson have set out to tour America with the Oxford Companion to the Wines of North America. A definitive collection that will opened and referred to time and time again. Another sure winner for the novice or the expert
4,DVD was perfect! Just like new! And Wanda Sykes is Great!,"Everything I've purchased at Amazon labeled as ""used"" and at a very good price came to me just like I bought it in the store New!!!! So don't ever be afraid to buy used products from Amazon!"
1,Sick & Tired - Right From The Start!! Wanda - what Weren't you thinking!!,"I'm a casual fan of Wanda, but NOT this DVD!!I had expected better. The ""F"" bomb all over the place!! - Which I DO have a problem with! I think she filmed this in Seattle. And to me -- it's like she decided to make a DVD, and instead of going on the road with it - and filming night after night - and capturing the best night - this is like - Tonight is the DVD night -- good or bad, qualtiy be damned!! And the audio, sounds like it was micked wrong -- or poorly. I bought this used for $7.00. If they had PAID ME $7.00 to watch it -- I still would feel cheated!!I don't know if she named this ""Sick & Tired"" or this is everyone's reaction to seeing it.If I ever catch a burglar in my house -- I'll do worse than shoot him -- I'll make him take & watch this DVD -- then send him a thank you card!! Scott M."
5,Nothing but funny!,"This was such a funny stand up routine! It is laugh out loud hilarious. I've watched a lot of comedy that made me smile, it is really hard to make me laugh, but this stand up would make anyone laugh!"
5,Wanda Sykes - Sick and Tired,This CD was of superb quality for a great price. I would recommend others to purchase it.
1,Wanda Sykes is trash...real trash,Wanda is a black thug. How horrible of her to wish Limbaugh dead.Wanda is a punk...
1,A lack of substance,"My major criticism of Peters' rather simplistic treatise is that rather than provide any real solutions to the problems that corporations face, all his advice will do is institutionalise his critics.His appendix of activist non-governments also displays an ignorance of many of the groups mentioned. Peters would do well to go back and do some proper research."
4,Flower & Garden Photography,This book is very easy to follow and gives a great deal of information about the different aspects of photographing both individual flowers and floral scenes. I was impressed with the detail in such a short book. The author gets right to the point and specifics that make good pictures. I would reccomend this to other gardeners who have trouble producing pictures to reflect how the plant really looks. I am buying another copy for a dear friend.
5,Quick and Easy,Zen of Watering Your GardenThis is a book that was helpful to me. it is quick and easy to read and use. It does not complicate photographing Mother Nature's wonders. I would recommend it highly particularly those starting out and hoping to achieve a modicum of success.It helped me.Matt Cohen
2,Cheap & Faulty,"I wouldn't recommend this product unless you like a vibrator that doesn't vibrate. Mine broke within a day, which was very frustrating. It is also too long and inflexible to use comfortably, and the supposed ""infa-red heating element"" was just a light!I was disappointed. Don't make the same mistake..."
4,Not quite as good as HOME,"Too much programming, but the content shines and there are good moments -- the jive storytelling of ""Gas Guage"" or the sweet soul of ""U Cant Sing R Song"""
2,Awful,"These dudes are just plain awful. Only in the mediocrity of country music can they survive and make the charts. Some of the worst vocals that you will EVER here. Ronnie Dunn is one of the worst singers ever.Nothing here as aweful as My Maria, but pretty bad stuff. The more my niece plays this crapola around me the sicker I get"
2,I believe,"I love the song I believe, but I feel it is the only song on the album worth listening to. In all honesty I am not a big fan of Brooks and Dunn so others may enjoy the entire album."
3,Worth the price,"There are several songs on this CD that are pretty good. I bought it for the song ""I BELIEVE"", and for me that one song was worth the price of the CD. I was pleasently surprised to hear a couple of others that I liked as well."
2,Stuck in Japan,"Awesome album. I bought it for ""Believe"" but there is not a bad song on the CD. Nice suprise of the song ""Building Bridges"". I was thinking to myself that sounds like Sheryl Crow, then looked in the liner notes and it was. Good harmony with her and Vince Gil."
4,one of John Saul's best!,"I read this book in Middle School and thought it was creepy back then. Its still holds up today as one spooky read. I also really enjoyed Suffer the Children and Punish the sinners.Ghost kids are just creepy ""if you ask me"""
4,"Oh, such memories.","This was the first book by John Saul and the first horror story I ever read. I was probably 11, we'll not discuss how many years ago that way, but I was on vacaation which entailed a long long car ride, 12 hours to be exact. My parents kept looking back into the backseat to make sure I was still there because i was enthralled by this book. The story, the horror, everything about it grabbed me and would not let go. My 11 year old mind soaked it up and hasn't forgotten it in oh these many years. If you have a teen who seems to like horror movies and scary type stories, this is the perfect story to cut their teeth on. It's scary, without being gory, but a story to keep them reading. I highly recommend."
4,My favorite from Saul,'Comes the Blind Fury' is by far my favorite book from John Saul. I found many of his others to be formulaic.
3,Only A Meat Loaf Fan,"Only a real Meat Loaf Fan will enjoy this album. I found it on cassette in a bargain bin in an Atlanta record store in the mid 80s. I think i paid a dollar for it. It was worth it. :-) It has 4 or 5 really good songs, Rock and Roll N Roll Mercenaries and Execution Day among them. I've since converted it to digital format and it is now part om my approximately 4000 song collection. For most people this album is probably a throw away, but, especially since I can pick and choose the tracks easily it has a permanent place in my collection. My musical tastes have been described as ""eclectic."" Maybe this is an indication of it."
1,Pain of Salvation neeeds to take a walk down remedy lane,"I'll be brief since every one else seems to think they need to write a novel. I thought this album was a major disappointment, I have only listened to it all the way through once and that was hard to do. I feel that it could have been very good, the music is alright and the album idea is kind of cool, but the vocals are way over done. The guy has a cool voice but he throws all this weird [stuff] in their with his singing and it wasn't ""emotive"" like other reviewers said, it was lame and made the album hard to listen to. There are only two songs that he doesn't screw up and one of them is an instrumental piece that is actually really good. I plan on burning the two good songs onto a cd and sending this album down the trash disposal, so unless you like good music ruined by strange vocal noises and grunts don't bother with this one!"
5,THE RAILROAD FUNK FOR EVER,"NO MORE WORDS, ONLY ENJOY THIS MUSIC, IS A EXCELLENT DECISION, GRAND FUNK RAILROAD MAYBE THE BEST GROUP IN YOUR MOMENT, A PIECE FOR REMENBER WONDER SONGS,SUPER RECOMENDED."
2,Tales of Lonely Trails,This is not an exciting book or one to read unless you just want to read as Zane Grey describes some beautiful landscapes.
3,Cumbersome,A little cumbersome to read for me. As always his ability to paint an imaginative landscape with words is amazing. Yet it was slow in develping a plot.
3,London under London,"Very cut and dried. I don't know what I was really expecting, but it was an OK read. Lots of photos."
4,Awesome stuff....,"This bool really helped my with my class at the University of the Pacific for Dr. Longmire. While the class was really boring, the book helped me understand everything i needed to know for thethe final. Lots of terminology and lots of good examples. If you want to learn about language this is your guide to success."
3,Know that this has a NEMA 5-20 Plug,"There is nothing wrong with this surge protector, but it does come with a NEMA plug. This information isn't on Amazon's description, but I did find it on Tripp Lite's site. Originally I ordered 5 and one of those 5 had a standard plug, the other 4 had a NEMA plug, so I thought Amazon sent the wrong thing and requested an exchange. When I got the 4 new ones in today and they all had the NEMA plugs, I called Amazon customer service. They were great in working with me to get these refunded.I did suggest they update the description so people would know that it wasn't a standard plug, but hopefully this review will prevent someone else from ordering the wrong item."
5,Great Jeans,"These jeans are well made, fit well and I expect that they willwear well. They are priced right. I am satisfied,"
2,Wrong Length,"My jeans showed up labeled 34x34 - as I had ordered them - but the true length was closer to 36. Other than that, I like the fit/style and the price is right."
3,going down in la la land,"the book which recounts the arrival in los angeles of a good looking myoung man, and his adventures asa porn actor/nude model. it is written breezily, takes no moral point of view (which is good as far as iam concerned).i understand it has been made into a low budget/independant movie. it will be interesting to see howit adapts to the screen.it is a good summer read for gay men - its target."
5,Cross-curricular poetry!,"After completing some other Poetry in two-voice and four-voice formats, this book offers an opportunity to reach your math oriented students, and touch the cross-curricular boundary. I used this book and the poems within its pages as a surprise for my math team partner. We practiced on some days that my partner was out on taking some professional development, and performed the poems for him upon his return. This is one more way to hook students on poetry."
3,3.5,This did a pretty good job of keeping my acne under control. But I also noticed that my face looked a little inflamed where I applied the liquid. The roll-on bottle also had problems with leaking.
3,A disappointment,"I found this book to be very dark, with scenes of torture and rape. While she might have been attempting to show the position of women in this society, it could have been done in a different manner. I prefer Faye Kellerman's contemporary mysteries."
1,All about Sex.,"I will be honest... I couldn't even finish this book, Every five pages there was something to do with sex and to be honest it got really annoying. Half the sex was rape and it was just totally taking away from the story. I am not a prude and if sex is vital to the story whatever but really this was too much. It was kind of interesting to read about the life in Queen Elizabeth's England and I enjoyed the fact that they used William Shakespear in the story. It was interesting with the murder of his friend and everything but other than that it was sex. Strait sex. The whole half of the book I read. Maybe it got better later. If you want a good Historical Fiction... find something else."
2,Too Small,These is a good brand but the shirts are very small. I wear a medium but would need an xl for these shirts to fit.
2,sizing issues,adult 2x is supposed to be a pretty big garment I thought but this 2x is about a medium or a tight large; definitely not a 2x. besides that nice for the price.
2,Be warned--the sizes are misleading!,"I had to get a maroon collared shirt for work...I chose this one. I ordered a small. Bad decision which I will be regretting for a long, long time. I'm 5'6"" and fairly skinny. The small just barely fits me. (The reason I got a small is that on the Hanes website, it said a medium was 28"".) Also, don't believe that it is ""fitted"" for women. The shirt is baggy, as are the sleeves."
5,Chicka Chicka Boom Boom,My kids loved this book so I was so happy to be able to get it for my granddaughter. The CD was an extra plus.
3,"Ok story, not great CD","The story is a bit long for my 7.5 month old, maybe when she's a bit older she'll like it. I had high hopes for the CD, but most of it is boring, just the same stuff repeated by different people. There's also a ""Street Rhymes"" song that has a line like ""Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider"" or something like that which I don't think is a great message for kids."
5,"Love, love this book",This book is so fun to read with little ones! The rhyming in it is great and very catchy. My little one can do her ABC's and can pretty much recognize most letters now.
4,Engaging and Educational,My three year old granddaughters enjoyed this verbally rhythmic book about letters of the alphabet. We added rhythmic movement to the syllables and sounds and it was just adorable.Good Night Lullabies
5,cute rhyme!,"son loves books, however because he loves to mouth them....this one is being saved for later...wish it was a board book."
1,I DON'T GET IT...,"OK. So lately almost every home I've been into with a child under 5 has had this book in their collection and for the life of me I CAN'T understand its popularity. Was it listed on some ""must have kids books 2012"" book list??? It's okay but it's basically the same picture over and over again with very slight variation. I notice the kids turning away with boredom by the second page. Who wants to look at the same page over and over again? Yes its rhyme is catchy enough but unfortunately the pictures are not and for the age group this book is aimed at both are important. I wouldn't waste your money or your time. If you are however strongly considering a purchase- take it out of the library first and see if it holds your kid's interest and attention."
5,Chicks Chicka Boom Boom,The book was in great shape and arrived quickly also it is a fun book to read. So all in all I loved it.
1,Michelle,"As a favorite book of a friend, we received this book as a gift. ""Chicka Chicka Boom Boom"" starts off well with nice rhymes and good rhythm, but deteriorates into little more than the reciting of the last half of the alphabet, which was very disappointing. I would skip this one."
1,Not Happy,"I ordered the Twinlab Stress B formula, instead you sent me the Twinlab Vitamin C. I am not a satisfied customer... In addition there is not a ""contact the seller"" selection on the tab for this product."
5,Great Supplement!,Why was impressed with these supplements. And I love the fact that it has 1000mg of Vit C so I don't have to take that separately. Within just 2 days of taking these I really noticed a difference in my energy levels.I had previously tried the generic CVS b-complex and I would rate this 100x better than that product.Buy it now!
4,Brilliant but Inconsistent,"I would almost skip the first section of the book and get to the plot which really starts in section 2. This book has some great philosophy and is both funny and provocative. My favorite thought is that you need to have both your mental process fully engaged AND your heart fully engaged to be a player in life. One or the other is not enough. True to his other books he throws in some mystical and magical bits, and embroiders the book with[physical] content. His genius is still there and the entertainment value is still high."
2,A Weak Effort,"Tom Robbins usually commands and holds my attention with a masterful use of the language and tremendous sense of humor. This book seems to have beeen written in a hurry, and lacks the qualities that make him stand out as an author.It was unsatisfying on most levels; but, thankfully, it was short.I can reccomend ALL of his other works; but not this one.Try one of his others if you are a novice Robbins fan. This might put you off him, and that would be a mistake!"
3,"Warning: Review Contains the Term ""up-to-snuff""","I'm a big Robbins fan. But I had trouble getting into this one. I never really connected with any of the characters, except Tanuki, the mythical dog-badger, who is missing from the bulk of the story. The plot never engaged me. The ending - what exactly happened in the ending? I dunno, even after three re-reads. Even Robbins' patented loopy writing style seemed rather not up-to-snuff this time. I'll reiterate what others have said: If this is the first Robbins you've set your hands on, put it aside and go for Jitterbug Perfume or Skinny Legs and All. Don't start with this one. If you're a veteran, you're probably not even reading this review. You're probably out buying it, and you'll soon be writing a review similar to this one (and the other reviews that this one echoes)."
2,not among the best,"Hard to top Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates. This book was tough to get through but did start to pick up 2/3 of the way through. I read it with a dictionary in hand and learned a few new vocabs. The mix between fantasy (Tanukis and Kitsune) and real lifeallegories didn't seem to jive so well. None of the characters were really well developed. Personally would not recommend it, sorry Tom you are a genious and would beat anyone at srabble but felt this one was a bit of a sramble..."
1,The lights are on but nobody is home in this villa.,"This contents of this book have much in common with the house of the title when originally found - the structure is there but it is empty. There are no great characters in this book which makes it easy to put down.As with others I eagerly awaited the release of this book after enjoying his last book ""Fierce Invalids ..."". Unfortunately I was left very disappointed. For those new to Robbins do not read this first you will miss out on some very fine novels - just go back in time."
5,Quintessential Robbins...,"This book presents us with the stylistic condensation -- of Tom Robbins' generally garrulously wonderful stoner-erudition -- into a polished metaphorical gem which elucidates the meetings of sacred and profane, East and West, man and woman, art and politics -- and much more -- in the context of recent Southeast Asian history and expat sentimentalism...A virtually epigrammatic masterpiece."
3,Not Robbins' best. Not his worst.,"Comparing this book to his other work, I'd place it near the bottom. It's not as uninspired as Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas, but not as vibrant as the rest of them.Compared to the works of other authors, it's pretty darn good.I wouldn't tell Robbins' fans not to read it. Though, if you're new to his work, I'd suggest reading his books in order, as Villa Incognito might not leave you hungry for his other, superior work."
2,Villa Inconsequential,"Tom Robbins latest and slightest of novels opens with a wacky Japanese myth about a randy, big-balled badger with a taste for sex and sake. Fast forward a few hundred years and we pick up the story of circus performers, government agents, drug smugglers and fringe dwellers of all shapes and sizes. Robbins tends to write about nothing and everything simultaneously and sometimes within the same sentence. At times Robbins get carried away with his thinly veiled PC 101 pontificating - bursting with bumper sticker philosophies and similies galore. Yet at other times his prose is as light and airy as meringue. These empty literary calories do taste good going down but unfortunately they melt away as quickly as they are ingested and provide nothing of substance or value. A fun but fogettable little diversion. What was that title again?"
4,A verbal carnival ride,"Initially, I found this book more than a little surreal, but as I continued to read, the verbal fireworks of Robbins' prose gradually won me over. Reading this book is the verbal equivalent to a carnival ride: fast and vibrant, it will make your head spin. The imagery painted here is vivid and alive, and the characters are quirky and complex. There are several seemingly divergent threads in this story, which suddenly converge in the end, though not all the questions are answered. The numerous themes that twist through the rapid-fire prose might be contraversial to some, but thoughtful readers will find plenty of ideas to chew on. An incredibly original book, it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I found it entertaining."
3,"Need a break from tv,.. watch these......","These movies won't win any oscars as they are nothing but soft porn thinly disguised as action/adventure, so when you get bored with todays modern tv and need a break, pop one of these in, you will get to see a watered down version of james bond, charlie's angels, and a sitcom all rolled into one , combined with lots of explosions and guns, I guarantee that you won't get bored, man or woman, you will find something in there to laugh or even smile about, and before we get too critical, Andy Sidaris deserves some credit for giving these playboy centerfolds a chance to do something other than spreading their legs in a magazine, therefore, if you are a person who don't take youself seriously and accepts that movies are for fun and entertainment then you have nothing to lose by watching these, besides, they cost less than $10., try paying that for 12 movies at the theater !"
3,B-rated movies,"This is a collection of B-rated movies, filled with B-rated acting. Look at the cover and you buy what you see. Cookie-cutter stories, and everyone tries their best. I think a few relatives of the money men behind these movies had some parts in them, and were definetly not great actors, but hey-I'd have done it too. Take your chances."
4,Stuck with me,"I read this book so long ago I can't remember when it was, but it stuck with me and for several years I looked for another copy before finding it on Amazon. It's an easy reading tale of a good guy who sometimes strays just a little over the line, and finds himself stuck in the middle between the mob and his longtime friend who wants to pull one last big job before it all over."
2,Not for Self-Learners,"Have a very firm grip on English grammar (prior foreign language studies wouldn't hurt either) before attempting to use this book. Dr. Volez doesn't define English grammar concepts and his terminology is highly technical. There is no attempt to simplify learing Koine Greek in this book. If your learning Koine Greek on your own, do NOT start with this book. Start with Mounce's grammar and then Fundamental Greek Grammar will make sense. Dr.Volez's book does have gems in it, but his textbook is difficult to follow for the average student."
3,Cheap spongy foam,These may be okay for mending an old road bike on the cheap but not for every day use. TheGrab On Maxi Drop Bar Foam Grips Black Set/4will work much better for the every day cycler. Foam grips deliver much more comfort than bar wrap but these feel very cheap.
4,"Fits 1"" pipe fine.","I had a custom handlebar made from 1"" pipe and needed a grip. Hot soapy water and no problems installing them."
4,3000 degrees,This book really illustrates all the events in an easy to follow manner and is very well written. I couldn't put it down!
5,Breathtaking,I have had the pleasure of seeing Signorello live and he is a fabulous performer. He has a powerful voice and great on-stage presence.His voice is seductive and perfect for an evening just kicking back and relaxing.Can't wait to hear more from him. He should be a star!
2,Super Boring.,"I thought this book was very hard to get through. Not made for teens, put me to sleep. There were some good parts, dont get me wrong .. BUT, I didnt understand the dialoge of the characters, they were speaking some sort of rocket science to me. Super boring ! Sorry."
4,First Meetings in Ender's Universe,A great short read for those who have already read the Ender cycle. It gives a great background for the rest of the series. Read it.
2,Disappointing,"Orson Scott Card's penmanship is evident in this short work, but apart from some details on how Ender became rich and a speaker for the dead, there is nothing new here. Not worth the money for me.On a separate and unfortunate note, Mr. Card is an outspoken opponent of gay rights and has recently used his fame and money to support anti-gay rights organizations and to advance their causes. I believe in equal rights under the law for all Americans, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation or any other discriminating factor. It is with regret, therefore, that I have decided to not support Mr. Card any further with my dollars, so I will no longer buy anything written by him."
4,Mind music,"The simple, individual songs of this album give way to great themes and a complexity that comes from this album as a whole. From beginning to end, each song blends well with the others and inspires the lister to really think about what the artists are yearning for/about/towards, yet it's not whiny or in your face. BUOS has a soulful quality that lets you take the music wherever suits you best. For this reason every time you listen to it, you find new things to hear and understand; some songs never stop touching you. The song ""Nora"" still brings me to tears and ""Oh, Virginia"" is everything a joyful homecoming should be. Obviously their first, but indicative of some of the great things they are capable of achieving in the future. Music for mind and soul."
2,Grass catcher for reel lawn mower,"Would love to use this product if I could figure out how to put it on the lawn mower. It does not come with written instructions and only has an illustration, which does not explain the process at all."
1,Doesn't work well,"Don't waste your money. Only about 10% of the clippings end up in the bag. I mow at 3"" and only the first few clippings end up in the bag. Good idea but not worth it since you end up raking the lawn anyways."
3,This item is not universal.,It looks great and is good quality but I could not attach it to my push mower. I had to return it. Carefully measure your mower and how a grass bagger might attach.
2,"Passable, at best.","I guess this thing gets the job done. Not sure what I expected for $23, but I got a flimsy-looking thing that looks like it cost about $3.50 to manufacture. You ever buy a tool at a flea market? Or in the bargain bin at the local big lots store? That's the level of quality you're getting here. That said, it catches most of the grass that zips out the back of my Scott 20"". Not sure if it'll last more than a season, though. Would recommend checking out alternatives."
4,Push Mower Catcher,"This is a good grass catcher. It is universal and I had no assembling to do to attach to my Scott 20"" Push Mower. I have the Mower with the tracking wheels and the grass catcher just snaps onto that bar. The price was excelent $20 for the catcher."
2,Save your money,"Save your money and don't buy this. The reel mower can't push the grass up far enough into this, so you end up with a big clump right at the front. You have to stop every so often to push the grass to the back or it'll clog the mower.Since you have to mow often with a reel mower, your grass can never get tall enough to leave those nasty clumps of grass like with a regular mower. So this is highly unnecessary."
1,Zero stars if it were available.,Useless. Total waste of money. Uncontrollable. Gets jammed and twisted at every bump and turn. Forget about going in reverse.
2,Stupid movie,Pretty stupid movie and to be honest in many cases you could see pretty bad acting overall not just the hammy performance by the lead woman. but the other characters as well. Not worth buying thats for sure.. Id save your money for a better movie. Also i noticed in many places it seems sound quality was kind of poor.. Meh.
2,Outdated,A bit outdated. Was somewhat disappointed with information in book. Wasn't what I expected or needed. Wouldn't purchase from this author again.
4,Breath-taking scenery!,"I loved this movie! I only wish it had been longer with more history and character development, as the viewer is not able to become completely taken in by the movie before it is over. However, the Scottish scenery is beautiful and the legend moving. The music is very haunting as well. I plan to watch this many times over!"
3,not bad,"This book was really fun to work through, thinking about how you have chosen the wardrobe you have and why. One thing I did not like is that the author brings her own personal style preferences into it a little too much, and she just might end up insulting some perfectly nice and stylish fashions that you have. I wanted to organise my closet, not make myself conform to one of the author's preconceived fashion ""types""."
2,Boring and Unhelpful,"I own just about every book out there about style and how to dress, and this is one of the worst and will be discarded. The thing that irritates me about this book is both the cover and the title imply that this book is fun and helpful. It is neither. I read it twice, by the way, to give it a chance. Don't waste your money."
3,Meh,"A passable entry in the Alex Delaware series; not horrible, but not something to highly recommend.Spoiler alert - I'm glad Robin and Alex are no longer together, as I never liked her from the beginning ... but I can't help but feel that the author is attempting to paint the newest love interest in an unflattering light. This became evident in the way he described how she looked while sleeping. Perhaps this is a petty issue, but my dislike of Robin is such that anyone other than her is greatly appreciated - but the author seems to feel differently. So I can't help but wonder ... if Kellerman feels that way about Robin, then why even create the final separation between Alex and Robin in the first place - unless it was a desperate attempt to breathe fresh life into a series that has become just 'so-so'."
4,"Predictable, but Still a Good Read","Petra Connor returns in this Alex Delaware novel, this time helping Milo and Alex track a serial killer who murders artists on the rise. Although it didn't take long to figure out who the serial killer was, this is an interesting read. The first person/third person switches throughout the book are distracting. Alex and Robin have split, and Alex's new girlfriend does not seem to have much depth. As in the last few novels by Kellerman, the book reads ""depressing"". I'd like to see a happier Alex, more relaxed Alex, not so arrogant Alex. Would love to see more of Petra. She's a great character."
3,Too Clever By Half,"Even for insightful, brilliant Alex Delaware connecting the first two murders is a stretch. An old bluesman is stabbed in the alley behind a small nightclub. A young artist is bludgeoned in the restroom of a gallery spotlighting her art. The connection is so tenuous, it sounds like Alex has a psychic on his payroll.""Cold Heart"" is highly readable. A first-time Kellerman reader would probably be impressed enough to purchase more Alex Delaware novels. For those of us who are long time fans, it is another outing that lacks the punch and logic of his earlier works. The tired subplot of his rocky romance with Robin (now they are on the outs) is almost a joke. Alex has found a new lady Allison who is so awesomely mature and perfect, she brings to mind Robert Parker and Spencer's super-irritating Susan.Wait for this one to come out in paperback.-sweetmolly-"
3,I Miss Spike!!!,"I always enjoy reading an Alex Delaware book but the author made a huge mistake breaking Alex and Robin up (I thought that even with all their trials and tribulations they were much better together than this new relationship) If he had to get rid of Robin, at least let Alex have partial custody of Spike!!! He was one of the main reasons I was so fond of these books. His descriptions of his comical French bulldog face and personality were wonderful. I loved Spike and Milo's love/hate relationship.Aside from that, I liked the book - good story line that held my interest right til the end."
3,Slow-moving novel,"Psychologist Alex Delaware is again helping his friend detective Milo Sturgis with some murder cases. Alex sees a connection between the murder of a talented blues player and a budding artist. Rather early on in the book they appear to pin down the murderer, but they are unable to locate him. Interviews with his parents and others who knew him lead them nowhere. Meanwhile there are some scenes between Alex, his current love interest, Allison, and Robin, his ex-girlfriend. Alex and Robin seem to have ambivalent feelings towards each other and these are not completely resolved in this book. Milo's colleague Petra has a new partner whose unusually stoic personality inspires some curiosity on the part of his co-workers. None of these sub-plots are terribly interesting, nor is the murder mystery. This is a slow-moving book which is not up to the others in the series."
5,Born To Trot,Born To Trot is one of my favorite books! I have read this book twice and it's one of the best books I've ever read! It's based on a true story and I think you'll enjoy this book a lot.
3,Grief - 'Come To Grief' (Century Media),"'Come To Grief' is a fairly good effort. Decent sludge doom, obviously influenced by early Sabbath. At least to a degree. Cuts I thought were the most impressive were the ten-minute opener ""Earthworm"", ""World Of Hurt"" and ""Ruined"". Line-up: Jeff Hayward - guitar & vocals, Terry Savastano - guitar, Randy Odierno - bass and Rick Johnson - drums. Should appeal to fans of Goatsnake, Corrupted, Sleep and possibly The Melvins. Give it a listen."
4,Only one review of this?,"Ok, let's get something straight here. This is classic. And people are selling it for cheap! If you'd like to hear slow, torturous, sludgy, horrible doom this is what you have in mind. Grief are highly influential and (from what I can tell) underrated. The music moves at a crawl, the lyrics are honest and fitting, the atmosphere is there. Occasionally they'll speed it up a bit for a 'quick' groove but most of the time it's just doom, slow crushing doom. They use the howling-shrieking-loud-growl-scream vocal method and it suits the music and lyrics well.What else do you need to know? Head over to www.Stonerrock.com and seek out a track . If this is your thing, you'll love it. I don't know many( if any ) people at all that like this kind of music so I don't know if there are those who sit on the fence.Recommended. I give four stars because I'm hesitant to give five though it certainly seems worthy!"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"This product had no voice volume at all, had it turned up all the way and was nothing.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR TIME on this one."
2,Akai chordfinder,"I was disappointed when I received the Akai KCF1 Keyboard Chordfinder. The screen is virtually impossible to read. The instructions are virtually useless. The idea is good, but the actual product is not."
2,Hard to see!,"I bought this because it was cheaper than the other chord finders, but I returned it right away. It's impossible to see the screen! I experimented with the lighting to no avail. It went back the next day."
1,HATED IT,"IT WAS SO SMALL, NOT AS THE PICTURE SHOWED. COULD NOT EVEN GET IT TO TURN ON. I THREW IT IN THE TRASH. IT WASN'T WORTH THE HASSLE OF RETURNING IT."
1,Does not glow in the dark - terrible ball all around,"I am really dissapointed by this soccer ball. Firstly it does not glow at all. My regular white soccer balls are actually easier to play with in the dark than this ball because its actually very hard to see in the dark. Not only that but the ball only lasted for about 3-4 weeks of semi regular soccer practice. After about a month it started getting ""eggs"" as my friend calls it. Basically it is little bubbles on the ball. It got to the point it wouldnt roll but randomly bounce around because of the eggs. Yesterday I finally lost the ball playing street soccer. Didnt even care."
1,ELITE Fails!,"I love this movie and i was so excited about it coming to Blu-ray that i just preordered without even the slightest worry about quality. Well, this is the second Blu-ray i bought by Elite and let me say i am at a point now where before i buy any more i am checking what company released it. This is a failure; the company should be ashamed and basically quit making blu-rays! They are NOT improving or remastering these movies at all. I have owned it on VHS and DVD... the DVD looks better! There are no bonuses over the Synapse DVD that are worth having. The commentary is ""ok"" but the Synapse commentary is better. DO NOT give Elite any more money until they do us justice - I swear, Mill Creek makes better blu-rays than this and they cost $6.00. I cannot say anything good in the least about this release, it is just really sad that companies can do this and get a way with it."
3,The Loved One,"Black humor movie about the overblown funeral business in Southern California. Amusing but not ""rolling on the floor"" funny. Worth the few bucks for the cameos, by many stars of the period."
1,The Loved One,This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. No humour the cast going through the motions for the money. I buy a great number of movies on Amazon's recomendation. Most have been good but for this one I should get a refund.I will give it to my mother-in -law for her birthday!Harold & Maude was a five star black comedy. The unloved one should be no stars at all.
4,Age of Barns,A great book to learn about the barns of the 18th and early 19th century. Although I was looking for a book descibing the detail of late 19th century and early 20th century barns I found this book quite enjoyable. I now have more Eric Slone books on the way...
5,an age of barns,I thought it was quite interesting. It shows a variety of different types and construction methods.Im looking forward to some of his other works.
3,Song Missing,"I love Garth but this is not one of his best. Also, the song list shows ""To Make You Feel My Love"" but it is not on the CD!"
1,Under-rated?,"I thought this cd would be worse than what it is. In other words I thought I would end up giving it 0 STARS. Hey, I listened a couple of times, and now I've given it 1 STAR. Sure it's terrible, but it could be a classic because of how bad it really is. Garth rocks when it comes to putting out complete trash and getting people to buy it. Maybe The Beatles, Stones or Elton John should have thought of that. Instead they went to all that trouble of putting out good music."
1,Not worth your time.,"though the book might be informative, I stopped reading after few chapters not because I was bored, but because the tone that was used to describe the people of India. The book constantly refers people by Hindu, or the hindus and lower cast hindus etc and muslims as momodians.The book's author is western guy and maybe he is christian too and for for some reason, the book seems to say that Christians are bit ""smarter"" in things they do in daily life. I am a christian, and I really did not like the comparison made here.I would avoid this book."
1,"DON""T EVEN WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!!!!!!!","I love zombie movies, and have tolerated a few that were certified ""B"" movies, but this one is an absolute F movie. It's awful, terrible, and reeks worst than the stench of the zombies that are in the film. Terrible movie score that won't go away, it plays throughout the duration of this silly movie. I think it's a comedy, but the trailer is very misleading---you're led to believe that it's a drama/horror film. The acting is weak and the special effects are horrible. PLEASE SPARE YOURSELF, it's not worth the rental."
2,The weakest neo-zombie film,"Not as slapstick hilarious as Peter Jackson's Dead Alive, nor as charmingly inventive as Shaun of the Dead, Undead is probably the weakest of the neo-zombie films which includes 28 Days Later, the Dawn of the Dead remake and Romero's Land of the Dead. Undead looks great, but simply isn't.This film has some excellent cinematography. The use of shades and lights is very well executed. But that's the only reason I gave this film 2 stars. Everything else is lame. The effects fall short, the characters weak even for a zombie film, the action sequences lacking and the gore is not enough. The only thing going for this film is the acid rain, the fact that the zombies have an extraterrestial origin as opposed to a chemical or voodoo one, and Mungo McKay's character.A big yawn."
1,Horrible ....,"This is a horrible movie. It is nonsensical in every sense of the word. they go out of their way not to explain anything. And why does the guy have a bomb shelter with no food, water or anything? Who takes the time to build a bomb shelter and doesn't stock it up? This is a silly movie that was trying to be funny and ended up being stupid. Avoid it like a zombie plague."
5,A Zombie Lover's Wet Dream,"A zombie movie in the same vein as such horror classics such as ""Evil Dead,"" ""Dead Alive,"" and ""Bad Taste"" ""Undead"" should be a zombie lover's wet dream. I'm not entirely sure as to why this movie got the low rating that it did, but as an avid and diehard fan of zombie flicks who has seen more than his share I thought this one is among some of the most innovative and best of them. ""Undead"" combines science fiction, alien abduction, and zombies to create an intentionally cheesy, tongue in cheek horror flick saturated in dark blue hues with over the top gore. Time should make this a cult classic."
2,Not my cup of tea.,"Was okay, I guess. I won't watch it again, most likely. The plot was strange, the characters were odd, and the whole premise didn't come together for me.That said, others might love it. It's one of those movies where you either love it or you don't."
3,Pretty Good.,"I like a good zombie movie. The ending was an interesting twist, honestly didn't see it coming. It does take a little while to get there, and it's a little confusing with the whole alien and zombie thing. It's a little slow at times, but overall i like it. Good for first-timers, and i look forward to their next one."
5,By The Western's Master,"John Ford just took the stock company to Moab, made a little picture that is a great wrap-up in a blanket treat on a foul weather winter night."
1,do not buy this product,"Bought this for my new Miami sun chaser trike---got it home, opened the package---it ripped immediately. Tried to put it on the bike, heard and saw it starting to rip more.....realized it was way way to thin and not well made at all. Took it back and got a refund--now looking for something better-----salesman at the bike store said to go to a moped shop and see what they have----gonna do that soon,."
1,Mixed Bag,"Be forewarned, about half of this book is devoted to the Binion murder case, with about a half devoted to poker. I was expecting more poker action and what it's like to play the wsop. I didn't really care for the Binion material."
1,Not even Mediocre at best....,"Ego focused, McManus is not a very good communicator! He is scattered in his thought process and was very difficult to follow at times. It was an interesting premise but the book was a dud!!"
1,Horrible,"Don't waste your money. If you feel you have to have this book buy it 2nd or even 5th hand. It is boring and not well written. I find myself simply skimming through many pages that get completely off the topic. If I could return any of the books I have purchased from amazon or anyplace else, this would be the one."
2,Positively Boring!,"I was so excited to read this book after all the glowing reviews. I had previously enjoyed Big Deal and the two Michael Konik gambling story collections and I was ready to add this one to my list of classics. Not even close! Unbelievably boring writing about poker which is surprising considering that the author got so far in the World Series, and it's filled with many technical errors that any regular player will find annoying. Very disappointed."
4,Positively Fun Reading!,"The first line is an attention-grabber, worthy of a great true crime book, but POSITIVELY FIFTH STREET is so much more than that. On a long shot, McManus enters the World Series of Poker when he goes out to Vegas to cover it and the Binion murder trial for HARPER'S magazine. He does a great job of covering it all, including history of poker and Vegas and the Horseshoe, his own personal history as a poker player and sketches of his fellow contenders, as well as the reactions of his wife as he first enters the tournament, then slowly progresses. He renders it in a style that gives us the facts but also gives us access to the hyper-articulate and often just plain hyper (and always entertaining) stream of consciousness patter constantly going on in his brain."
5,"Awesome Writing - Captivating, Exciting - A Page Turner!","Two incredible stories tied into one amazing experience and one great book. A word of caution for all of you looking for a how-to-win at poker book - this is NOT IT! Some of these other reviews are obviously from people wanting more about how to make it to the final table at Binion's - this is not that book.What it is though is an exciting tale, very well written by a true literary who happens to be a poker fanatic that had a great string of luck at the most opportune time. The murder portion of the story is quite incredible itself and I'd be surprised if there isn't a TV movie made about it soon - because you won't believe what went on.I loved it - READ THIS BOOK!"
2,"Started off with a bang, and then fizzled","This is a perfectly good book. I enjoyed the bits about Ted Binion's murder in the beginning, but lost interest when McManus began recounting his poker hands in excruciating detail."
4,"Enjoyed it, but too much discussion of his family...","I enjoyed reading Positively Fifth Street. I began playing Texas Hold 'Em two years ago and consider myself addicted. The majority of the book covers his tournanment experience and the Ted Binion murder trial; both areas were intersting. However, his editor should have deleted the sections on his family history and relationship; they really dragged down the story when it was getting interesting. Did he think he was still writing for Harper's? I got the impression he was writing a book and ""thought it would be cool"" to write about his family history and his relationship with his wife (whom he also included a photo of for some reason).I will recommend it to my Poker buddies, but I will tell them to skip the family history chapter."
4,A PAGE TURNER,"A really good book - plain and simple. A terrific, surprisng, interesting story written exceptionally well. I enjoyed all of it. It's the kind of book you want to read when you don't want something that's ""heavy,"" but rather something that's pleasurable and a page turner. Nothing assuming about Mr. McManus' style. Just right on point. Thank you author for a delightful book."
5,Making it look easy!,"Often one of the most overlooked aspects or genres of photography is the ability of a photographer to grab a certain nanosecond of time and leave behind an impression of a people or a culture that anchors that people in time forever. It looks easy because there are so many talented photographers who have left behind haunting images in magazines such as National Geographic, Look, Life, etc. Add Wayne Schoenfeld to the mix.... In this book this California photographer brings us two incredibly different cultures as Turkey and Cuba, somehow unified by his gifted camera in this book are the serene, hard eyes of Turkish men and also the naked playfulness of blonde peasant Cuban children in Pinar del Rio province - these are disparate subjects that in a rather unusual manner come together beautifully as do many others, in this excellent book."
3,Monks belong in Jupiter videos,I thought the movie increased Jades role and that perhaps she belongs in a jupiter video what with all the sanskrit/tibetan writing on her at the end.
2,OK mower,"I was very excited to purchase this product. Wanted to ""go green"". Did read reviews prior to purchase. Some areas of my grass are fine. There are MANY blades that are not cut and you have to go over it again (especially at the edges of the mower). Bogs down easily on anything that is not flat,flat,flat. Any hills, divets and you may have problems. It is harder to push than I expected. I also have the problem of the bolts falling off the bottom. I don't think it is made for my type of grass and area but could be very useful to the right person."
5,Reel Push Mower,"I LOVE my push reel push mower. It works great and does a beautiful job cutting the grass. I do have to rake up all the sticks in my yard so the mower doesn't get jammed with them. Also. my husband had to make cutting adjustments for a clean cut in the beginning. Now, I look forward to mowing my yard. It is very quiet and no smell. I have found it to be a great way to exercise and take off pounds. Cheaper then going to the gym! Best 85.00 ever spent."
4,good customer service,Received the unit on time. Once open the mower had a small broken piece. Called customer service and received the replacement piece in 4 days. Mower works great on my bermuda grass.
2,Cinderella Should Be Ashamed!!,"I have purchashed My Interactive Princess Belle and found no pleasure in it because everything broke so easily. So watch out! Playmates makes many toys that do not last long. The dancing Cinderella mechanisim that makes her dance is not worth it because your child would have to not touch it at all for it to stay in good condition. Another company came out with a line of 12"" disney princess dolls with gowns on that morph into wedding dresses. They would enjoy these much more, plus they can be used with regular Barbies for more exciting play times."
1,Low quality,"My 5 year old was so looking forward to this doll. First, all the doll does is spin and play music...that's when she's working. We are constantly...ever other minute...having to reset the doll because it is very tempermental. Sometimes the music won't play, sometimes she won't spin. Her arms get caught in her dress, her dress gets tangled. It is a very delicate doll. It did not keep my 5 year old's attention and is worth more trouble than it's worth. More a show piece that a toy to play with. We are very disappointed."
2,Not what we expected!,"That's what we get for not reading all of the reviews in advance of buying. Thank goodness we got her on sale! The doll only dances while the jewel is pressed and the tiara is lifted, which means my four year old has to hold her to dance with her, and possibly clock her brother in the head. Worse than that, the music stops playing after a very short time and the doll has to be ""reset"" by turning it off and on again via a switch on her back, behind a very tight velcro closure. My daughter can open the back and turn it off and on again but cannot close the back of the dress back up. I think even a die-hard Disney Princess fan will be disappointed with this doll within a day or two. She should at least have a base that she can dance in!!! Do not buy!"
5,review,"it's the story about the founding of aa. it was excellent when i first saw it on tv, the hallmark hall of fame, many years ago."
3,Hallmark Hall of Fame Strikes Again?,"I wonder if this film is a *slightly* maudlin, syrupy, and overly-romanticized version of the strictly biographical history that so many millions of us have come to treasure in our twelve-step societies, AA being the first; notwithstanding, this film puts life, sound, flesh and bone, with appropos faces, to figures many only know from the black and white pages of AA literature. One can't be too critical of such larger-than-life portrayals of our founders and friends..."
4,Looking in the mirror,I saw this movie for the first time a few weeks ago. Even though the movie is dated it was very inspiring. JoBeth Williams reminded me of myself. It was like looking into a mirror. The movie shows the struggles of Bill W. and the struggles of his wife. All the broken promises and false hope she felt until Bill changed the course of his life. What a great inspiration Bill W. has been to so many people.
5,A LIGHT FROM A DARK PLACE,THIS IS THE TRUE STORY OF BILL WILSON AND HIS DESTRUCTIVE JOURNEY THROUGH ALCOHOLISM WHILE MARRIED TO HIS WIFE LOIS. THIS IS THE MAN WHO STARTED THE AA 12 STEP PROGRAM. HE CAME TO REALIZE THAT TO STAY SOBER HE HAD TO WORK WITH OTHER ALCOHOLICS EVERY SINGLE DAY. I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. IT GAVE ME A BIT OF INSIGHT INTO WHAT SOMEONE IN ADDICTION GOES THROUGH EVERY SINGLE DAY BEFORE AND AFTER THEY FIND THE PEACE OF SOBRIETY.My Name Is Bill W
4,"Interesting people, excellent script",Linklater did an excellent job of capturing realistic people who talk realistically about life. Delpy is captivating and carries the movie.
4,different,this movie takes you around europe with 2 young people who start to have feelings for eachother after spending the day together. Lots of good conversation and keeps you interested enough till the end.
2,"Talk, talk, talk, but goes no where","If you like 'day in the life' movies, it's good. But for me, I hate it when all the dialog in a movie goes no where. I did love the characters but when all they do is talk through the entire movie about nothing, I kept hoping it would get better."
4,Linklater has a knack for dialogue,"Before Sunrise, stars Ethan Hawke as a goatied 20-something on his way to Vienna. He meets Julie Delpy and they strike up a conversation that basically lasts for 100 minutes. Thats the plot, and that is what makes it brilliant. The dialogue feels genuine, Linklater is a good director, and he certainly has the ability to purvey a realistic feel to his movies. Like his other films, Before Sunrise takes place in 24 hours. It is a dialogue-driven film rather than a plot-driven one. Hawke, who has been typecast as the cynical, poetic literate youth since Reality Bites is a likeable character, and so is the lovely Delpy."
1,cotton candy,"Unfortunately I'm not so readily disposed to fall into a passive torpor while watching the gorgeous julie delpy that the plot ceases to be of any importance. The dialogue may be slightly above average for the typical american film, but attempts at intellectualism and romance seem to come from the mind of a naive young adolescent. The reason this film upsets me so is because it contains two excellent actors who could have achieved something brilliant if there was more substance to the story line. A brief consultation with Kundera would have been enough."
1,P.O.S.,"I suppose this sprinkler hose would be OK if it is always left in one place, but I had several duties in mind for it.While the amount of spray was just perfect for the parking strips that I used it for the most, I came to dread setting it up because it is so cheap and flimsy it would very easily get into nightmarish twists. I would end up wasting a great deal of time untwisting it. I found that it is easiest way to get it untwisted was to turn the water on and just get soaking wet, but save time. Upon about the 10th use a rose thorn slashed it and it was kaput."
3,The sisters' stories are interesting.,"The author has brought together some interesting stories about sisters. Her conclusions, however, about the meaning of these stories are open to question. In addition, she excludes from her book half sisters and step sisters, showing her bias toward ""nature"" as opposed to ""nurture"". I found the stories very interesting because I saw a lot of the same issues I have had in my relationships to my half sisters. An interesting book, but shallow."
4,American Lawn Mower SK-1 Reel Mower Sharpening Kit,"Have not used this kit yet but it comes with everything needed to sharpen the reel mower blades with and with the instructions and other reviews written it seems simple enough to use. I would not have purchased this if it would not have been for the reviews on it telling you how it works, because the picture shown makes you wonder now how is this going to work. Will try it out when it is time to sharpen the blades and find out how well it works. Received item on time and in good condition."
4,Hysterically Funny!,"I haven't seen this movie in 20 years or so, but I still remember it as being one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I laughed until I cried. It's silly, but wonderful. In the same vein with Soap Dish and Airplane -- over-the-top, but fabulous!"
4,Probably the best one available,"I only wished it had a map of the trains. Other than that it was a great reference. I could carry it with me all the time and it even has useful phrasebook. The visuals allow you to make quick decisions.You probably still need to do a lot of research online if you want to find off-the-beaten path spots. For example, if you want to stay in a Buddhist temple in Koyasan you get more info from the web. But this is always the case if you want the most up-to-date information. By the way, I highly recommend checking japan-guide.com."
4,A good start to plan your trip to Japan,"My wife and I enjoy to travel and we have been to many places and we have used the DK Eyewitness Guides a number of times (see my homepage). We bought the Japan guide to start planning our trip to Japan in May 2005 and we found the guidebook useful (as usual). We used it to find out where to buy tickets for a sumo match in Tokyo, we used it to navigate around Tokyo, we used it when we came to a restaurant in Kyoto where the two old people behind the counter didn't speak any English etc. We also found it very useful when we went to the castle at Himeji and found out that there was no guided tours in English. The book has lots of pratical information in my opinion or maybe it is just me that are getting used to this style in guidebooks. I do find the DK Eyewitness guides to be far more interesting that e.g. Lonely Planet, Frommer's etc"
2,Boring and Predictable,"Katie Holmes is utterly wasted on this movie. It starts off interesting, with Holmes trying to pick up her life after her boyfriend vanishes, but quickly goes downhill from there. We learn that she has been left first by her father, then by Embry...and that this is her worst fear. What is supposed to be a surprise twist ending is anything but, because the least astute of viewers can quickly figure this one out. The empty ending - with her about to be left by yet another lover - resolves nothing. Get the DVD of ""Dawson's Creek"" instead. It's far more entertaining."
1,Shameless and Obvious,"There are so many things wrong with this film, I feel like ruining the ending for everyone just so they don't have to waste two hours of their life watching this drivel. I have no idea what the Oscar-winning Writer (can the academy take an award back?) was thinking here: part College-slice of life, part detective story, part alcoholism p.s.a, part love story. ALL DONE POORLY. Skip this mess. Not even Holmes, who's been impressive in ""Wonderboys,"" and even the ""The Gift,"" can make ANY of this film convincing."
2,Could have been much better,"Yep, a good acting and a story begining well until you lose the plot and finally understand the illusion things easily. Then the end that messes up the whole plot with an unroginal twist if we can still call that ""A twist"". A pity! They could have made a very scary movie out from this."
2,I should have abandoned this movie,This movie is so slow. I was spacing out while watching it. The characters are so two dimentional. Katie Holmes is a beautiful actress but she cant act. The real saver of this movie is Zooey Deschanel whose beauty and outgoing character is the only good point.
5,Hours of fun!,We purchased this for my daughter's 4th birthday and the kids LOVED it. The inflatable slide was comfortable for little tummys and the pool at the end kept the water in for a nice slash. We've really enjoyed it.
5,Better than the Milepost.,"I found this book to be more informative than the Milepost, as it is better organized and shows campgrounds and facilities that are of interest to those people who are planning to camp with RV or tent.The book shows all campgrounds in each section of road traveled and also describes activities that are available in the area. It is informative and clearly written with excellent directions for locating attractions. Though I have not been to Alaska yet, I did show this book to fellow travelers who have used the Milepost and it was met with enthusiastic response."
5,Great Book,This book is everything we wanted it to be as we will be traveling that way next year. This gives us a chance to review.
5,The Oak Ridge Boys On Capitol Records,"This is the Liberty Records version of the album Capitol later released as ""I'll Be Home For Christmas."" It gives fans a chance to hear several songs from their first Christmas album, with Steve Sanders instead of William Lee Golden. Steve did a great job on ""Thank God For Kids,"" and during his Oak Ridge Boy years, this song also became a Steve Sanders signature song. While it sounds totally different from the Golden version, the song is still sung with a lot of feeling."
5,Natural Remedies that Really Work!,I ran across this book when my elderly dog was diagnosed with a heart murmur and heart disease. When conventional medicine couldn't help I decided to give natural medicine a try. I used some of the remedies suggested for heart disease and was frankly astounded at his improvement. We were very happy to have him with us for 5 more years than I expected. The book is easy to understand and ailments and their remedies are listed in alphabetical order in the back of the book. This is really a must have for every dog and cat owner that wants to find out how they can improve the health of their pet naturally.
3,decent,"The flag is on the thin side, but it has held up over the last year or so. Some fading as well. Light weight can actually be good though if you get a lot of wind. Would buy again."
4,"For any Gates fans, don't miss this book","This book tell about Gates and his company quite detail. Any Gates's fans surely can trace how Gates built his company from zero to the top,step by step quite completely, through this book. Even this book maybe little bit confusing to read at first coz many technical names, this book is worth to be read.Just by looking the front cover and reading the first page, I think any Gates's fans like me will like this guy more."
4,White Christmas Soundtrack is a year-round classic,"This soundtrack has wonderful music from the 40's and 50's, and is a favorite of our entire family. Please re-release this!!"
4,I want the sound track!,"I agree will all those who want to see the ""White Christams"" Soundtrack for sale. It is one of the greastest musicals of all time and it is a shame that one can only listen to it by watching the Televsion. If there were a soundtrack made I would listen to it all day long. Especially those days when I was depressed!"
1,Depressing...,"What exactly was there to like about this book, other than Charlotte? Nothing! Alexander Foakes was so vile to her I don't see how a few moments of kindness here or there could make up for his treatment of her. The story itself would have been more interesting if there had been a decent plot, but as it was, the entire book was based on 'gossip stories.' This important guy made life-altering decisions based on unreliable people's idea of truth, knowing full well that these wicked people thrived on destroying other people just for the fun of it."
5,Excellent Book,"I am an avid romance reader. After going through every other genre I have have fallen in love with romance novels. This book is one of the many I have read. But unlike some of the others this one is one I will never forget. I have read the only other two by this authour and I recommend them fully, with all me heart. I am constantly searching for more books by Eliose and have yet to see any more. I hope she writes again soon because the a novel can only be savoured for so long."
2,Too sappy! Too stupid!,"This book was silly, stupid, unbelievable and way too SAPPY for my taste. It was also very predictable. I thought the characters acted more like teenagers than adults. Don't waste your money. If you still want to read this book go to the library."
1,Disappointing.,"I'd heard so much buzz about Potent Pleasures that I thought it must be absolutely wonderful, and the setting is one I know and enjoy. Unfortunately, the plot was contrived and overwrought, the historical details inaccurate, and the hero unheroic. :::sigh::: So much for paying so much for a hardcover I thought I was certain to love. I'll be more wary next time."
5,Touched My Soul and Opened My Heart,This is the first time I've heard the Rankin Family. The clarity and harmony of their voices is almost mesmerizing. This is a perfect example of contemporary Celtic music. Their talent and love of music comes across in each track. I recommend their music to anyone who loves the Irish/Scottish genre.
2,Didn't Have Me Quivering!,"I know I was supposed to be be flipping pages wildly, with my hair standing on end, but I really couldn't get that immersed in the story. But, Shutter Island was foisted on me, and I stuck through to the end because the foister just might give me a pop quiz. Shutter Island isn't a bad book, it's just isn't my kind of book. I call books like these ""hat tricks,"" or maybe talking horses. Real live book reviewers call them great ""gotcha"" books.Lobotomies and withdrawing from Tofrinal aren't really very terrifying or interesting. And Teddy or Andrew? Well, I couldn't seem to care. For real terror, I vote for The Horned Man. Shutter Island? It'll make a great movie after it's made a gob of money in book form for the smiling man of the back flap."
2,Rated X for........................,"We bought the audio version based on the ratings found here on Amazon. This was also our first exposure to Dennis LaHane's novels. Are they all filled with the F word? When you say psychological thriller does that mean bizarre sexual fantasies are described? Who needs this?Yes, there was a twist at the end, but we were basically disappointed and found the book offensive to listen to. I would NEVER, for example, loan this audio cassette to my parents or to my children or to my friends."
4,Enjoyable,"Dennis Lehane has had some critically acclaimed books that have been made into movies including this one starring Leonardo Di Caprio, Gone Baby Gone starring Ben Affleck & Morgan Freeman and Mystic River starring Sean Penn & Tim Robbins who both won Academy Awards for their roles in that movie. This is what seduced me into reading this book.I thought this book was a little predictable, but it was so well written that this didn't particularly bother me. Sometimes the journey is just as enjoyable as the destination.Even though it doesn't take an Einstein to guess the ""twist"" at the end, there are minor twists & explanations which still got me by surprise particularly in relation to the codes that make this book a cut above and ultimately a satisfying read."
5,excellent book,I loved this book! the ending was so amazing I had to go back and read all of the clues I had missed!highly recommended!
2,Walked away dissatisfied,"Couldn't put it down, but when I got to the end, I wished I had not spent all that time reading it!"
2,Sixth Sense II: Shutter Island,"Great Writing, lazy ending. Lehane is a better writer than this. If this is your first Lehane read, please give him another chance."
2,time & setting details somewhat off.,"This is the second Lehane I read, it was ok and a fast read but it seemed again that little details are wrong. For instance I don't believe people generally bought coffee at newstands in 1950's. The idea of people walking around drinking coffee is kind of new. I went to college in boston & worked in town in the late 60's and that wasn't typical then even (I'm addicted to coffee so I'd remember). Also he made it seem like those harbor islands are remote and inaccessible. There are little islands all over the place and not too far away from each other. I also wasn't surprised. I will read Mystic River before I see the movie however."
4,Help !! Could you please explain me the end ???,"I immensely enjoyed Mystic River (5 stars de luxe...) and jumped at the occasion to read again a book by the same extremely talented author. But I didn't understand the end of the book (may be my English is to blame - not my mother tongue), that's why I rate it only 4 stars.Is someone out there capable of decoding the end for me ??"
4,Suspenseful. Couldn't put it down..........,"My husband recommended this to me. He's read a lot of Lehane, but said this one was different and more my style. He couldn't wait until I finished to discuss it--that's worth 4 stars when you have a quiet husband! If you don't like being left with more questions than answers, you may find this book frustrating. In fact, I may have to go back and reread it, now that I know the ending."
1,"Makes me ""Shudder""",After having thoroughly enjoyed Lehane's previous PI series and Mystic River I regret having stayed up so late last night to finish Shutter Island. I feel cheated by the grade school type ending and am glad that I borrowed the book from the library rather than waste my money!
1,Disappointing,"The story was a little confusing, I constantly had to reread the prologue to try to figure out what exactly was happening and who the characters were. The story was suspenseful and interesting but the ending was a complete cop out. I would never buy another book by this author. Its just like any other psychological thriller, confusing and unsolvable."
3,Smoke and Mirrors,"I'm a huge fan of Dennis Lehane (Mystic River was simply brilliant) but Shutter Island is a little too gimmicky to even think of as a genuine novel. It's just a big set-up for a plot twist that fans of the genre will see coming a mile away.If Lehane weren't such a skilled writer, this novel would warrant a much lower rating. The final chapters (following the big plot twist) almost made me forgive the predictable twists and turns of the first 2/3 of the novel. These pages literally ache with such a profound pain and sadness that it seemed a shame to waste them in a novel that is little more than a parlor trick.Shutter Island is haunting and deeply affecting at times, but all in all, the novel is little more than smoke and mirrors. If you haven't read anything by this author, I recommend you start with Mystic River or Gone Baby Gone."
3,Reads like the movie Lethal Weapon.,"Fast paced, don't have to think too much, twists and turns, and a predictable ending. I am sure you'll enjoy, but don't expect to walk away any smarter!"
3,A bit of a stretch!,Without a doubt Lehane is an awesome writer! For that reason alone he gets 3 stars. What's up with the editing? I have read 5 of Lehane's novels and I have loved them all but this one. The story line had so much potential but it took a deflated turn. I really felt let down. I like the Patrick and Angie series much better. A loyal fan!
2,The most predictable unpredictable ending ever,"Took a while to get going, but the middle was wonderfully written, suspenseful and mysterious in that wonderful dream-like way. Then the whole experience unravels into disbelief. The author, Dennis Lehane, broke character and scene far too often to provide clues and red herrings--so proud of his big reveal--which was anything but. After so much potential, I hate to say it left me bored, eager to get to the last page just so I could put it away. There are many amazing psychological thrillers out there--but this is not one of them."
5,Shutter Island Review,My husband enjoyed the book. He read it in a few days. He had seen the movie and decided to read the book.
1,published jacked up the kindle price,"Why is this book two dollars MORE expensive than the paperback version? That is absurd. I was coming here to buy this book, but am now spending my dollars with a publisher who doesn't insult my intelligence."
2,Great Book/Garbage Language,"I do not consider myself a prude, but I have to say that half way through this book I was so tired of every character using the ""f"" word every third sentence, with ""JC"" thrown in between that I was quite weary at the end. LaHane is a very good writer and the book was clever, but c'mon buddy! I work in the world and nobody I know talks like this constantly. You are much too gifted to stoop to this. I was thinking I would let my son read it, but nope....Too bad."
4,A Dark Tale Very Well Told,"I have just finished Shutter Island and as I sit and think about what I have just read, I am reminded of a thought I had when reviewing one of Jeffery Deaver's books - ""I would hate to have that man's nightmares.""I would like Lehaine's no less.It is difficult to talk about the plot line of the book without telling you more than you need to know in order to appreciate the writing and the images and mirages that lay in wait for you.It is a very dark tale, told by a master writer which will stay with you for some time. Lehaine takes the old saw of ""It was a dark and stormy night..."" to new heights or depths, depending on your point of view."
4,A great dark mystery,"Teddy and Chuck, two US Marshalls are assigned on a case involving a missing mental patient/inmate from a mental institution on Shutter Island. On their way to the island, Teddy gets seasick, and the reader is already sensing that something is wrong with Teddy. And true enough. While searching for the missing patient, we learn that Teddy has some almost disabling migraines and that he is trying to deal with the horrors of World Was 2, where he was involved as a code-breaker. Teddy and Chuck suspects that there is more going on at Shutter Island than what just meets the eye, and this novel is masterly written. The ending is very surprising, and the author has managed to give the whole story and overall dark feeling, which just makes the story more intense. There are many things and happenings to think about in this book, and my guess is, that this is one of those books that will be better second time you read it."
3,"An exercise, not a novel - but great for a movie","I really think I read this book. But I might be on LSD in an insane ward and tricked into dreaming that I read it. Either way, it was entertaining up to the end. Except there wasn't an end - only loose ends. The author just gave up, leaving countless red herrings flopping around. Though I might be imagining those too. I did skip all the WAY TOO LONG hallucination sequences, unless it was all a hallucination.I wouldn't bother to read / hallucinate this story again but will be glad to try another one by Lehane. If it was by him and not by me."
4,Worth your time!,"This is an unusual story, and well worth your time. LeHane is a master of building suspense, and keeping the reader hooked. That's all you can ask of someone in this genre. Seeing reviews which state that the author wrote this for himself are nonsense. This is a terrific read that will stay with you for a long, long time."
4,Awesome mix of nature and music,Scott Fitzgerald has done a great job with every song on this CD. He takes just enough nature and blends it perfectly with his original music. A perfect recording!
2,an absorbing portrayal of interior thought.,"I found Albert Cohen's magnum opus ""Belle due Seigneur"" a very personal, idiosyncratic display of the workings of the internal dialogue. If nothing else, Mr. Cohen has caught the stuttering, semi-incoherent lilt of the person talking to themselves. His pacing is that of a daytime soap opera, and the internal chatter makes it very compelling and oddly reminiscent of Dune (Herbert Marshall).Criticisms would include a cynical tone so profound that it becomes limiting."
5,"Wow, hard to forget this one!","Albert Cohen's masterpiece is intimidating both for its size and chapter-long sentences. But, please, do not be discouraged. This is one of the most insightful novels I have read. It delves into the bureacratic labyrinth of international institutions, mocks their functionaries, and is a haunting critique of European virtues on the eve of the Second World War. (Particularly funny for those familar with the World Bank, UN, or government anywhere).But, most importantly, it portrays the relationship between men and women in a profound yet comic way. The book's difficulty is quite worth the struggle, especially when you reach the chapter where Solal seduces his beloved. A chapter that is hard for me to forget, for it shows just how stupid and cruel we are.This is not for the lazy readers, but if you have any guts, read this one. Its worth the while."
1,Almost everything in XP is a SERVICE PACK save your money!,Almost everything in XP is a SERVICE PACK save your money!
1,I SHOULD'VE LISTENED,This product is the absolute worst.........well let me be fair....I'm still unable to install the OS.....It's been 4 days now I've been trying to install the software and it continues to hang/not respond during certain stages of setup.......now I'm to the point I can't even begin the setup...
2,"Don't you just hate mediocre, corporate mush?","Kind of like driving a Ford Fairmont. It'll get you there, but that's about it, with a very good chance of crapping out on the side of the road. Plus, you get to proclaim that you've got the taste of a herd animal.Fun!"
3,A little disapointed at the price,"Greetings,Microsoft is going to quit supporting windows xp I hear next year. Also this is the old edition. This is the cheapest I could find, but still it's a little expensive for my blood."
1,dont bother,"If you have a computer with older peripherals forget it just buy a new computer with xp installed on it, I went back to my old ME Just becuase It was more stable with my 1 year old system. I wasted a bunch of time with this product..now I have a new modem, video card and cd r/rw...my computer is better than ever and it only cost me about 300 bucks ...oh and since you manually turn the system on and off ..my hard drive burned out also ...xp was the most frustrating experince ever.."
3,WinXP Maybe,"I'm a big fan of Win2000 because I've used it for more than a year and haven't had almost any problems. Windows XP is fine for looks and the extra features it has, but my problem is when a program has an error, the operating system pops up the screen to send an error report and no matter what one chooses (yes or no) Your program and progress is going to close and be lost. For that reason Win2000 is still a better buy!"
3,XP beta,All XP is is Win2k spiced up a bit.. Its a waste of money I think. its good for beginers though
1,same features lower price,"SuSe Linux 7.3 has better firewall, crypto file system, virus mail scanner and PGP encryption for e-mail. Also outperforms win2000 in many performance tests. Now that's smart! Bring on the competition!"
2,Warning to those with more than 1 PC,"Windows XP is a fine piece of software and the first really significant upgrade to the Windows system in a very long time. but beware, an individual license is required for EACH AND EVERY computer that you insall plan to Windows XP on. So if you have a laptop and a desktop, you will need TWO copies. If you want to install on your office computer and your computer at home, you will also need two copies. You can try and obtain just an additional license as I did, but for reasons I still don't undertand, the license I purchased didn't work with the media I had. Furthermore, Microsoft's specialists on its product support and actvation lines were not knowledgabe enough about the process to help, so I was ultimately obliged to shell out the extra money for a second boxed copy. And getting a refund for those unusable licenses is not easy. (...)"
2,never crashes???,"Reviews here and elsewhere reported the XP either rarely crashes or never crashes....I'm sure I'm having some type of driver/hardware conflict... the Win2000 was a much more stable OS and XP... my XP crashes about once a day, Outlook Express and Explorer crashes about 4 to 5 times a day, and the Internet connection via cable modem freezes every day. With Win2000, my computer crashed maybe once a months."
1,FREEZE and Reboot..........................FREEZE and Reboot,I am very upset mith Microsoft! All this OS does is FREEZE up (3-4 times a day)!!! DO NOT BUY THIS UNTIL THEY GET IT DE-BUGGED. I miss Windows 2000 and I miss my (dollar amount)...
2,I rate this below consumer reports glowing review,"I purchased this product partially on the recommendation of consumer reports. Looking back, I would have gone further and NOT bought it. The iPOD interface is poor at best and the speaker setup via the front menu/remote usage is difficult"
3,Good - but problems with the DVD,"I love the MacMillan & Wife series. However, both the season 3 and the season 2 DVDs don't play well. On several episodes, the DVD stops and won't play. Sometmes it will skip ahead and continue playing, but you miss alot. Again - great series, but not sold on the quality of these DVDs."
5,The unforgettable LUCIO BATTISTI(1943-1998),"Lucio Battisti was a great italian singer. In this album you will find some of his best songs. In Italy he is a legend and everybody knows his songs. He died last year on 9 September and in that occasion all the newspapers dedicated to him the first page, all the radio stations played his songs. He represents for Italy what John Lennon represents for the world. His songs are the soundtrack of the italian people: Pensieri e parole, Emozioni, La canzone del sole, Ancora tu, Acqua azzurra, Acqua chiara, Non è Francesca...... and many others. I hope you'll enjoy listening to it!"
3,Limited but has some use.,This is not a sophisticated program. However it's cheap. I use it and like it because it is an improvement over QuickBooks customer management functionality. If you are aware of its limitations you won't be disappointed.
1,"Great concept, lousy implementation",When QB came out with Customer Mangager I was really excited. The features I need finally available. The concept fits perfectly with my business and it is very customizable. But beware. The program is buggy and creeps to a halt eventually requiring a complete removal and new installation to keep it running at any reasonable pace. I was hoping version 2 was better but now into version and 2.5 and I can't wait to get all my data into something that doesn't hang my system up. Don't waste your time and money on this program. Shame on you QB for the empty promises.
1,"TOO SLOW, TOO MANY BUGS!","This is, on paper, an excellent idea and has lots of potential. Unfortunately, it SLOOOOOWS your system down to a crawl -- which is frustrating to the point where I don't want to use the product.As I said, its a great idea for me. I have been searching for a product that could help me track my many projects without the overkill of a MS Project.It also has many annoying bugs that need to be addressed.The program has great potential and if it worked as it claims I would give it 5 stars -- but, it can't live up to its promises and until Intuit addresses these -- DON'T BUY IT!!Too bad -- I love Quickbooks and am disappointed in this product, especially since this is version 2.0."
4,Actung Cramps fans!,"Not bad. These guys sound like a more ""Heavy Metal"" version of the Cramp's later albums- especially on gems like ""black lung"", ""flesh garage"", and ""she casts no shadow"". Also recomened to lovers of ""Psycho-billy"" (ie Demented Are Go) and fans of Wednesday 13, Misfits, Rob Zombie and classic Alice."
1,poorly done...,"I found this book horribly dull and unbelievable, not to mention very poorly edited. Who edited the book - the authors' dog? Not only the car snafu, but on pgs. 28-30 Harrigan is misrepresented repeatedly as Harrington! A huge disappointment after the back cover's glowing reviews. So glad I didn't spend a penny on the book, rather, checked it out from my local library."
2,Spend your time on better things.,"This humdrum novel features a pathologist who seems reasonably plausible and a trial lawyer who I believe is supposed to come across as a real courtroom star but who probably should have her license revoked for incompetence. Her real talent appears to be in wearing expensive clothes, which might lead to some sort of viable career after her legal practice expires.I read that the coauthors of this volume are in fact a well-known forensic pathologist and his wife, who is an attorney. Considering this, the book's mystery becomes less to do with its plot and more with why the lawyer protagonist is such a ditz when she obviously is not supposed to be seen as such.I did find things about autopsies and other forensic esoterica that were interesting, although the characters are not quite believable. But weak character development is a common problem with most of the vast number of crime novels flooding the market these days."
3,Very Nice Book,"I'm using the word ""nice"" because this book was an easy, non-offensive welcome read. It was quick, somewhat intriguing; contained interesting forensic information. I will read the follow-up to Remains Silent when it is published. A good job."
2,Fast read,"Quirky characters worked well in advancing this light mystery in which lawyer Manny and forensic pathologist Jake focus their combined energy and expertise in resolving a creepy crime confounded by greed and ambition.Predictable with some too-simple conflict resolution, the ending left me feeling a bit slighted. The infatuation and ultimate sexual entanglement of the two main characters not only didn't add to the story, it actually undermined the initial descriptions and early development of the co-protagonists.Still, it was a light, fast and fun read; better for escape than for satisfaction."
5,"The ""Superfly"" of the 90's!","This is one of those rare soundtracks, an indespensible classic! Great music from the masters of funk and soul: Isaac Hayes, Curtis Mayfield, James Brown and Aretha Franklin among others. It has got a kind atmosphere that can't be described. This has got to be one of the best soundtracks ever. A vintage record. The ""Superfly"" of the 90's!"
2,"Good, but still not back to the best.","After years with TurboTax, I switched to TaxCut.Primarily because Intuit charges a premium to Mac users, and because of the spyware issue of two years ago. Now, they have corrected the pricing issue, Mac and PC software on the same disc. But they have added the problem of installation issues. And the spyware monkey is on their back again.While the spyware issue seems to be untrue, they are having significant problems with convoluted installation processes. Just as well to stay clear and try TaxCut instead."
1,Many features have been removed,"As of this year Turbo Tax Basic no longer supports employee stock plans, stock options, or simple schedule C functions. In order to get these you must buy the $69 Premier version. Worse yet, if you are a long time user of the basic version and don't bother checking the product comparison, you don't realize this until you have purchased and installed it. Very disappointing!!!!"
1,THIS IS NOT THE UNRATED VERSION !!!,"The story and acting is awful, but it worked for what it was intended. Problem is, the DVD is labeled as ""unrated"" when in fact it is the cut-to-pieces ""R-rated"" version. It's pretty much like watching one of those edited-for-TV things you see late at night on the USA network. No recall has been issued to my knowledge and its hardly worth the trouble anyway."
1,Disappointment,"I agree with the other reviews. This so-called ""Unrated"" DVD is certainly not. It has been edited so heavily, it could almost have just a PG-13 rating. And the editing was so obvious. If you could find the original unedited version it would be worth it. Athena Massey is very nice to look at. But this heavily edited version just leaves you disappointed."
1,NR Undercover - I don't think so,"To continue the same thread, this movie was edited to the point where it can be viewed on Late Night Cable. Please try to obtain a copy of the True-NR version - Athena would make the search worth it. I saw the unedited version on Cinemax or The Movie Channel, one of them, anyway, my lady and I really enjoyed imitating the scenes. Fantastic."
5,Wonderful Book on Prayer,"Dr. David Jeremiah's book PRAYER, THE GREAT ADVENTURE is an excellent book on developing a solid, biblical prayer life. The outlines that Dr. Jeremiah uses are well worth the price of this book. Each chapter examines various aspects of prayer from the basics of prayer to spiritual warfare to praying in the Spirit. The book covers nearly every aspect of prayer and as you would expect from a skilled teacher such as Dr. Jeremiah, he stays true to his text.I higly recommend this book on prayer. It will add to your prayer life and give you a rich understanding of what the Bible says about prayer."
4,One of the best books on prayer I have read,David Jeremiah is one of my favorite authors. He makes Scripture easy to understand with vivid illustrations. This book will help any serious Christian understand how God wants to use prayer to get us on the same page with Him. This book has transformed my prayer life and I have challenged our church with many of its principles.
5,Hard to find,"It's hard to find a burn gel, so I bought these online. Disclaimer...have not used them yet. I bought these for emergencies only."
1,Expiration,This stuff expires in 2 months and has a 3 year shelf life. Returning this product as soon as possible.
2,Only for very small areas,"I bought this 1/2 acre model BK-15D to replace my old 1 acre model that stopped working in my back yard. This unit can barely attract the bugs to it, and when it does it seems to struggle to zap the bugs. It seemed like it wasn't working at all so I moved it to the front yard where I have another 1 acre model. The zapping nearly stopped as soon as I changed zappers. It was working but not like the larger model. I further tested it by plugging in both units and the bugs were flying through this unit to get to the bigger one. I recommend paying a few extra dollars and get the 1 acre model Flowtron-BK-40D which I would rate 5 stars."
1,bulb broke now,"We bought it month ago, did not use it every day, but the bulb broke now. So disappointed."
5,Bug B Gone,"Works like a champ, I have this outside right by my porch and I can tell you this is one of the better zappers out there. This unit has an open flow design to it so there is no need to have to go out and clean it day after day, the bugs fall right through it and out the bottom. I reccomend this product to anyone looking for a quality zapper."
2,almost useless,"I spent the money on it and the holder, but the result is far away from what I expected. Maybe my mosquitos are too small to fly on the height of the lamp?)) looks like they hide in the grass and bite my legs! And also it is so-so effective only during night time, dusk - no use, I have to spray myself anyway(("
4,Good product,"This item was perfect for our use. We had an infestation of some mosquito-type insect. As soon as the Flowtron arrived, I plugged it up and listened to the wondrous sounds of frying insects. You do need to make sure the grid stays clean if you want to maintain optimum performance, but a can of compressed air does that job well."
4,it is good for the price,"We bouhgt this product 2 weeks ago,and it works fine.it kills most of the insects.it is not efficient for a big garden."
4,Transformer in the unit died after two months,"This unit works great. However after only two months the bulb quit and then the unit died outright. The company did respond to my emails within one week and suggested some things to try, which determined the transformer in the unit had died. It was reparable under warranty but I had to spend another $17 to ship it back. In the meantime I was without a bug zapper for over a month (I ended up getting a 2nd one after 3 days as the fly situation was getting desperate). The original unit was repaired and received this past weekend. We'll probably put the repaired one in the camper to use when camping so having two isn't a problem."
1,Will last about a week,"BUYER BEWARE: It appears Flowtron currently has quality issues with the starter bulb that starts the fluorescent tube in the most recent units. Bought three of these from two different sources in March 2011, one source being Amazon. Within one week, one unit from Amazon and one from another source had quit working, leaving only one of three working after a week. The bulb simply stops lighting and that causes the grid to not energize too, rendering the zapper useless. The third went in about 4 more weeks so after a month and a half, my small sample of three has a 100% failure rate. Flowtron sent me some starter bulbs (a $2.50 part) and that DID fix the problem. I'm hoping that the fix will last as replacing the starter bulbs on a new unit is a nuisance and some people might not be comfortable with the repair. When these work though, they attract/kill more bugs (and many mosquitoes) than any other electronic insect killer I've used. And I've tried three different brands."
2,Broke in less than a week,"I never really got to enjoy this product, as it broke in less than a week. Before it broke, we found it difficult to install, mainly for the reasons noted in other reviews: it has to be plugged into an outdoor power outlet strategically located to make it effective in killing bugs where humans are, but not exposed to the elements, which would obviously cause it to short out. This seems like a design flaw that can somehow be improved upon, but in the mean time, we are returning it for the limited reimbursement offered by Amazon, because it simply does not so much as turn on."
4,Works pretty well,"After installing this, we still saw some mosquitos in the yard and didn't think this was doing anything at first. Then it was out of service for a week (not a defect, the pole I had hung it on fell down in the wind) and we were suddenly overrun with mosquitos. So overall, it definitely helps but it may not get rid of all your bugs."
2,Insect Killer,I purchased this product on the recommendation from a friend. I was under the impression that it would help control mosquitos. That has not been the case. I have been disappointed with the insect killer in the control of our mosquitos.
2,not for mosquitoes,TThis is an excellent product if you want to kill moths and other bigger bugs. however it usually the ones that bite that u want to kill such as mosquitoes and i noticed no effects on the little blood suckers. there is still just as many . its disappointing ...
2,Not effective for Texas mosquitoes,"The Flowtron unit arrived broken and had to be sent to the manufacturer for repair. After two weeks, I received the repaired unit and placed it into service. So far it has zapped lots on light seeking bugs (i.e., moths) but I haven't seen any noticeable decrease in the mosquito and gnat population. It has been operational for 10 days and has two Octenol strips attached to the bottom of it.At this point, I wouldn't recommend this device to anyone seeking relief from mosquitoes. However, if you enjoy the sights and sounds of bugs being zapped...it would be highly recommended."
3,"Works Well, But Starter is Hard to Replace","The unit works well at attracting and zapping bugs. But about a year after I bought it, the lamp stopped working. I replaced the bulb but that didn't fix the problem. As it was under warranty, I contacted Flowtron and they thought it was the starter, and since I told them I was technically knowledgeable, they sent me a replacement.To replace the starter I had to remove the cover, remove the transformer, clip the 2 leads from the old one, and solder the new one in place. The manual actually says that the unit must be returned to have the starter replaced and I can see why. I don't mind having to replace a part once in a while, but if the starter is a part that wears out regularly, it should be designed to be replaced easily by the user. Having to return it to Flowtron or use a soldering iron is unacceptable."
2,Not for mosquito..,"I live in Michigan and tried this product BK-15D for about week - outside and inside of house. I returned this one last night.This one lures and kills a lot of moss and other insects, but not mosquitos.Even with chemical attachment on the bottom, it does not lure mosquitos much.I tested this product on white outdoor table and actually pictures to count how many mosquitos vs other insect. The ratio is almost about 1:30. Yes, I found one dead mosquito out of other 30 dead insect bodies.I do not recommend this product for those looking for to kill mosquitos.Do study and find the face that UV does not lure mosquito."
3,FLowtron BK 40D,Works good but collects a lot of moths that just clog up the zapper part.Have to clean every other day. Not sure if the mosquito lure really works.
5,Zaaaaaapppp,"It works. I put this in the back yard and about 10 minutes later I hear the zap and crunch of burning bug. It kills the moths and mosquitoes, but too bad it doesn't get flies too as they don't seem attracted to the light."
4,Nearly Bite Free,"This machine really kills the skitos. This year the excessive rainfall has really brought the little critters out. The morning after a warm, still night the grids are plugged full. This brings me to the 4 star instead of 5. The grids do plug up. A lot of bugs do drop through, but I still must blow out the unit every other day at least. It may not be possible to engineer a machine to kill this many mosquitoes and clean itself too. All in all a very good buy."
3,LIGHT IN UNIT WAS FAULTY......AND MORE DISAPPOINTMENTS!,"I recently received this product and just put it out yesterday. It seems to be working wonderfully and there was a pile of dead insects this morning to show for it!! I will post again if I have any compaints...but don't really anticipate any. 12/30/08 I now have a complaint! The light in this unit was faulty. It still comes on but the light is yellow and not white like it's suppose to be and it doesn't attrack the insects now. The light went out about 2 months ago so it wasn't but maybe 4 months old. 7/27/09 I ordered a replacement bulb on March 22, 2009 to get ready for the mosquito season...today is 7/27/09 and that bulb burned out 2 days ago! 4 month life span...AMAZING! Needless to say...I WON'T be replacing it again at a cost of $21.99.....and will be looking for another bulb that will work in this unit."
4,Great value,"For the price, I can't see how you can beat it. I just retired my Mosquito Magnet as it is temperamental and expensive to keep running. The Flowtron 80D is very simple, hang it up, put in the attractant and turn it on... done. Replace the attractant every 30 days and you have a very effective mosquito killer. It does attract and kill other flying insects but I can live with the collateral damage. We have a lot of mosquitos in Florida and I noticed a huge improvement in 3 weeks. In the middle of summer we rarely see any around the property. For less than $100, I can't find anything that will beat it."
1,Flowtron BK-40D --Great product when it worked!,"Worked great to keep the flies away but product life is next to none! This is our second unit because the first one (same exact unit) stopped working (no lights) after less than 2 weeks of use. Now, after less than 30 days of use, the light is out again. I would return the product to request a refund or a replacement with a longer life product but my cleaner threw away the box without me knowing. Expensive amount for around 6 weeks of use! Now I have to search for an alternative ;-("
3,pretty good product,"Works ok, but doesn't killem all! Probably should have went with bigger unit. But for the price, it does the job. It is a good buy."
1,choose something else--please,"This device kills light attracted insects. MOSQUITOES ARE NOT ATTRACTED TO LIGHT. DEER FLIES ARE NOT ATTRACTED TO LIGHT.These devices have been shown to significantly reduce populations of beneficial pollinating insects. You can find a summary of the research inScience News Online, april 22, 2000.If you want something that works, try one of the CO2 emitting devices. That's what biting flies are attracted to."
2,No very effective against flies,"We have a housefly problem in our backyard and were desperate to make our picnic table useful. Reading all the good reviews made me have hope. The problem is not that it doesn't zap the flies. Its that the flies never go into it. I put some food to attract them, but they would rather just eat the food we had a few inches away on the table. I was under the impression that flies would be attracted to it. This is not the case."
3,Great Moth Killer,"We had a hugh outbreak of mosquitos in late July due to heavy rains from late May thru July and the county didn't have any money for pest control so I thought I'd give this unit a try. It is extremely effective at killing the local moth population but I have yet to see any indication that there has been a massive skeeter kill. On a side note, this unit gives off a tremendous amount of light so I got two for one. A skeeter killer (??) and a security light."
4,Mini mosquitos,With the outbreak of dengue fever in my area of Honolulu I needed a way to control the mosquito problem at my home. I can't control what my neighbors do with their standing water but I've been able to defend myself from a rabid mosquito hoard that has been feeding off of my family with the Flowtron. It has killed a few innocent bees but luckily geckos and other insects have been spared while a pile of dead mosquitos accumulates every morning under the light. I just wish this came with a tripod to mount the light closer to the ground.
2,disappointed,"I live near properties with horses so there are lots of flies. To my disappointment, I found Flowtron BK-15D Electronic Insect Killer, 1/2-Acre only done half of the job. it killed small bugs but not flies. it zapped the flies and the flies fell down but stung only and eventually came back to life and flew away. This one went back to Amazon"
2,No zap for fly's,"I purchased this product under the assumption that it would zap normal house fly's.Unfortunately, it did not. I wanted to zap the fly's that hang around my patio when I BBQ. I placed it within 2 feet of the fly's and the fly's did not fly towards it or near it therefore, not being killed.I am sure it works great for misquitos but not fly's."
1,terrible,"These work great to ATTRACT the insects. But the zappers fail quicklythey worked wonderful for about 1/2 hour, but then they clogged up and stopped zapping completely. I bought 2 and will be sending them both back."
5,FUN,"this is a good old time. we call it a ""redneck pastime"". if you like not having bugs, it will do the trick. but if you want something fun going on the background its also pretty nifty too"
5,best item ever,"this 1 1/2 acre bug zapper is fabulous. it works great. very effective. i love hearing zap, zap, zap killing those bugs. runs on very low electricity wattage. also makes for a great yard light at night. nothing else works as well killing those mosquitos."
1,Very poor delivery,"I ordered my product in September 2004 and still have not received it as of January 29, 2005. I cancelled the order. I would rather go to a store and buy it than buy from this seller! Don't bother."
4,Good product at a reasonable price,"It is easy to set up and effective within the range. However, would prefer warmer light. Just bought it so don't know how long the light bulb will last and how much for the replacement bulb."
1,Worst purchase ever!,"This only worked for a day. The next day, the light did not come on when I plugged it in. I live in southeast USA where we have a lot of bugs so after reading all the great reviews, I decided to order one. When it did work, it did not kill a bunch of bugs like the reviews said. I saw a fly get zapped a few times and then escaped. I'm so disappointed and still have bug problems.We called the number the included - they said to go back to Amazon and check their policies. My husband had to call twice since they did not return his phone call. This has been an absolute disappointment so far and we'll never buy another one of this brand. In fact, I'll go through a store next time."
4,Bug Z apper Zaps Bugs,"We received the Flowtron 8K from Amazon as scheduled. It was to be replacing another of a different brand that didn't work very well as the slats on the sides of the previous one were too close together and the larger flying insects like moths couldn't get between them to get zapped. This Flowtron 8K works just fine. We have a 31foot long patio. Only problem we have had is that the noise made when insect were zapped, frighten the dogs, as they didn't know of course what the odd noise was all about. We had to move it further away from the patio doors as well as turn it off for a day or two, and then it no longer bothered them.PLEASE, leave name off the review, and use just my nickname, Zany Old Lady in Colorado"
2,Not suitable for mosquitoes,"If you intend to kill mosquitoes... this is not the item you are looking for. Its great for killing pretty much any other flying bug, except mosquitoes which -in my case- is the reason why I bought it... and yes, I did use the mosquito lure and nothing, not one was killed"
3,Kiddy Scary!!,"The Witches is a book based on the book written by on of the best selling author of all time, Roald Dahl. When a boys mum and dad are killed he moves to live with his grandmother and they take a trip to England in a huge motel. But what they expect isn't what they meet. As the Grand High Witch (as mentioned by grandmother at the beginning of this story) and the pack are there out to catch all the children in the hotel as possible."
5,One of the best Fairy tales I've seen,"Loved the story, loved the actors. I bought this movie before DVDs were born, and when the DVD came out I bought it too. I keep watching out for a remastered version (like a lot of remade action movies) with DTS or Dolby Digital audio 5.1 but still no luck. Anjelica Huston is one of those rare American actors/actresses who can hold their own amid an all-English cast."
4,must own The Witches,"A fantastic tale for ""kids"" of all ages. One of those movies that you can't ever get out of your head. I saw it a couple years after it came out in the theater and really liked it. I would also watch it whenever I happened to see it on t.v. It seems each time I'd like it more and more. Not to mention it was Jim Henson's last movie made, so even more of a reason to own it. My 3 1/2 year old daughter just watched it today for the first time. I thought she may freak on me and I kept asking her if she wanted me to turn it off but she kept insisting NO. When the movie was over I asked her if she was okay and she said yes and she wanted to watch it again!! At 35 I still like it, at 3 my daughter likes it. I don't feel you can go wrong with this one."
3,The Witches,This is a great movie and it is one of my daughters favorite. I know once we get the movie it will be fine. For now. I ordered this product in July and it is not to arrive until sometime in Sept. any where from the 1st to the 28th of Sept.
4,good ole folktale,I like it I remember the story from long ago.Must have read the book as a child. and I like ole folktales.
5,Love it!,Love this classic movie! Bought it for my kiddos and we all love it! The DVD got here quick! Love this movie! Defiantly worth buying :)
3,THIS MOVIE SIMPLY GREAT!,"I had read the novel by Roald Dahl before I first saw the film, and I thought that it would be too scary for words...but it wasnt...maybe it will be for kids who are under 7. It is humourous as well as it is frightning, and it also has quite a bit of adventure, for a fiction film. The actors and actressess are simply fabulous...my favourite was Angelica Huston who portrayed the Grand High Witch! The story is fairly fast-paced compared to the book, and even though I may like the book better, I *love* the film as well! If you're a fan of Roald Dahl or if you like fiction/horror films, youi've got to see this!"
2,This isn't Elizabeth Montgomery type of witching,Little boy and his grandmother who have had brushes with witches before end up staying at a hotel that just so happens to be hosting a convention of witches. The boy soon discovers their huge plot to rid the world of children slowly and is turned into a mouse. What shapes itself into a really interesting shocker becomes unoriginally formula oriented and wants to be reguarded as an adventure instead of a one and only. Huston is VERY good under the circumstances.
1,Windows 2000 is the best....,"Forget it stick up with Windows 2000 , Me or 9xThis Software is Useless and demands lots of Money..."
2,go pro!,"Don't waste time with Home. Many productivity app vendors won't guarantee compatability with XP Home, and even Microsoft's own Tablet PC software won't remote control an XP Home box (and boy are they pushing that for...the home of all places!)"
3,only choice I had,I'M NOT TOO THRILLED WITH THIS PROGRAM. IN FACT IT IS THE ONLY PRELOADED PROGRAM THAT IS FOR SALE ON ALL CPU'S THESE DAYS. I DON'T WANT A NETWORKING PROGRAM LIKE XP. WHAT HAPPENED TO 98. IF SOMEONE WOULD TRADE ME WINDOWS 98 THEY CAN HAVE THIS PROGRAM. I HAD NO CHOICE WHEN PURCHASING A CPU
1,Big Joke,"Do not be fooled by the ""If you love Twilight, you will love Blood Red Moon"", this movie is just a Twilight wannabe. It should be illegal to make a movie and depict the scenes as they did, it tried to immitate scenes from Twilight, notice I used the word ""tried"". The acting was cheesy, the storyline was ridiculious, and was so low budget, they apparently didnt even have a tripod to set the camera on, the camera shook and was not stable in most of the scenes. The only way to describe this movie is just plain HORRIBLE! Please do not waste your money."
1,What is this!?,"I think this is terrible!! On the happier side tho, it was so funny to watch. They do need to put in the description that someone is buying a B movie and not a professional film. Just a bunch of kids in High School making a funny movie for class!"
1,"You have no idea how bad a movie can be, until you see this one.","These actors try their best, but the director must have been, well I just can't fathom what he was thinking. I could have directed this better straight out of rehab. This person couldn't direct himself out of a hole in the ground.The script writer is on another site bragging about how good this movie is. Truly, truly, my friends, the world must be coming to an end. For the legions of Hell have come up from the sulphury crags of the bottomless pit to direct and write this crap, supposedly to cause me an aneurysm.My wife is still watching this, and you can't believe how much it sucks. Oh God, please, put me out of my misery! I'm sorry, I have to leave the room."
2,Not worth the money,"Anything you read in here has already been written in much better detail. although the pictures of the exercises are good with explaination, you can get this from the internet for free with a little looking."
1,The Apocolypse is Upon Us ...,"... if this book is any evidence. Holy smokes. I'm a doctor and this book belies virtually every basic medical fact known to man. On top of it, this guy is to steroids what Scooby Doo is to the hairlip population. I've now figured out who buys it: gays. This is a gay segment coffee table book. 'Nuff said."
5,Perfect Map of Rome,"Rough Guide maps make other maps look like child drawings. Do not leave home without one. The extras, like the ""time map"" with all the opening hours of major museums and churches, in addition to just the quality of the map itself (everything being to scale, the nice color scheme, etc.), make this map perfect. The fact that it's indestructible (plastic) is an added bonus!"
3,A good selection,"This album can't be seen as a consistent group of inter-related songs. It's an almost random selection among the large, rich and complex universe of Brazilian Music. Some songs and compositions are wonderful, some are not that great. But the song ""Zamba Ben"", a precious groovy timeless rarity is probably worthy the CD just by itself."
2,Pretty much the same as the first volume,"I got this one thinking it'd be better than the first volume. it wasn't. In fact I find the music so uninteresting that I can't tell one song from the next. They all sound the same, on both CDs. I can't believe the reviews are so positive and I'm shocked some compare Mehdi to Yanni. Yanni's music is truly unique, each song is different, and the melodies are very memorable. Mehdi is good for listening while studying, reading, or working, or even better for trying to fall asleep!"
5,Wonderful is an understatement!,"I have been listening to Instrumental Odyssey every day while at work and it just makes the day go by so much better. Songs like Eastern Sunrise, Desert Oasis and White Dove are truly remarkable. I must admit, the whole album is so lush and full bodied that it will always be one of my favorites. For what ever it's worth, Buy this album... You won't be sorry, infact you'll see that to say this album is wonderful is definitely an understatement!!!"
3,Used for class,"I personally dislike the book, but it was required for class. Others seem to enjoy it though."
3,Good Quality-Wrong Color,Picture shows black and the mat came clear. Misses word that said clear. Would not work
1,Well,"All I can say is, this is NOT an appropriate item for a hospice ... lesson learned--the hard way!"
5,A book you can not put down!,Read the book twice. Hard to put the thing down. Keeps you on the edge. A must for the horror nut.
5,"forget some of the other reviews, this is a fine book","i had, of course, read about glenn . . . but did not know that much about him . . . now i do, as a result of reading his memoir . . . as a result, my only regret is that i never got a chance to vote for him for president! (i would have)"
3,The Story of a Perfect Life?,"Based on this book John Glenn never got out of line, never got in any serious trouble or caused anyone else to get into trouble, had a perfect wife and family who always supported him 100%, even if it meant his being away from home for long periods of time. He even goes to the extreme of discounting a story about his concern over his height exceeding the max requirement for space travel. I found many parts of this book enjoyable, but left feeling I had only been reading a whitewashed version purified for mass consumption. On slight hint at the ""real"" John Glenn may be revealed in his writing a letter to NASA in an effort to overturn the decision to have Alan Shepard and Guss Grissom fly in space before him. This book left me with many more questions about the real man. Showing more of his human, occassionally risking and failing side would have added much to my enjoyment. Unfortunately this was missing."
5,"Exercise, Nutrition, Science - It's All Here","This book is incredible. It has been a companion of mine since it was first introduced many years ago. This book was designed for just about anyone in mind, any age, any physical shape. It teaches you the importance of diet and nutrition, stretching and exercise, with plenty of examples for those of us with little experience at these subjects. This is a book for anyone who cares about the health of their body. So get the book, and then get motivated."
4,The best book I found,"After browsing through 50+ books in the bookstore, I picked this book because it showed me how to improve my body. Most other books have pictures of body builders, but this book tells you the truth that it is impossible to have such massive musles for most people. It also contains many interesting, SCIENTIFIC facts about loosing body fat, including how loosing too much body fat can be bad for longivity.This book covers almost every topic that I am interested."
5,One Hundred Six!,"Thank goodness for the recent healthcare legistlation to protect my health insurance. Because I have a pre-existing condition, bad. It's called Mambo Feber!"
2,ok not exciting,"good text, ok layout , dull pics!there are much better books out there please angkor is great subject matter but this is not a great book."
4,Very good for the money,"I have an 8 year old Marantz reciever- and although this does not have the power of that reciever, for the money this ONKYO offers excellent sound and quality. It offers basic features for old audiophiles like myself, without breaking the bank. Very recommended."
4,A classic story,"This book is a great book. It describes the way a white man feels when he switches from having a normal life in the late 1950's to being a black man in racist situations. It has an important lesson along with this book: it says that blacks in the 1950's should have been treated with the same respect that white men were. White men picked on the blacks, not letting them even share the same restroom, simply because they didn't think they're skin was the right color. This is a story about a man who discovers that color isn't an object to place racism on, and that people can get along when there's no prejudice."
5,Great Product!,I have used this product for several months and love it. I tried several different products to help control facial blemishes. This product works very well.
1,Don't buy this buggy piece of software,"Although much anticipated, this software will disappoint when released (with several unsquashed bugs). Unless you are a home/hobbyist user, don't buy this software until the service pack releases squash some of the bugs.Trust me on this one."
5,Microsoft windows XP,"I think XP is really great! To the people who have incompatibility issues, they are NOT irreconciable in most cases. You ALWAYS have to get the drivers for your older hard and software when you upgrade your operating systems. Many times, these are totally free and downloadable online. Check it out. This happened to us when we went from Windows 95 to 98, it's pretty standard. Such is the ""progress"" of computers!"
1,Overpriced and underwhelming,"After all the hype, and the steep price tag, I was expecting something a lot more revolutionary.All it is is windows 2000 dressed up with an annoyingly cutesy copy of the (much beter looking) Mac OS X. Bundle in a few apps (media player, etc), that you can download for free anyway and hey presto, a 'very similar to the last one' operating system.Oh, and don't forget that you need a new PC with stacks of RAM to get it to run at a decent speed.Stick with Windows 2000 and if the interface really bugs you, download a free XP copy skin from the web."
2,More than 1 PC,"The operating system is good. Much better than 95, 98 and 2000.The main problem I have with Microsoft XP is that if you have multiple system - you need to have a software license. Each additional PC requires a license. Maybe, I will switch over to linux OS."
5,Excellent..Must have. worth every penny,"I did the conversion from Windows ME and I have a fairly new computer. I deleted all my programs and saved my important files to insure a good transfer. The installation was simple, and my computer became much much faster. I had no problems with any hardware or drivers. Just look for XP drivers on the products web site and there shoudl be a compatible driver. Everything was working great, but i converted my file system from FAT32 to NTFS about a week after my upgrade and it was the biggest mistake I ever made. Ya, the new format allows more disk space to be used, but I now have trouble running alot of programs, my keyboard delays when I type, and I get many errors, but they do not require a system restart. I highly suggest you upgrade to Windows XP but DO NOT convert your file system to NTFS unless you are performing a clean installation."
1,Installation Woes (Wind-woes),"For those that own the product and got it to install congratulations. Myself I haven't been as lucky. The installation process will not go beyond the first reboot without giving an invalid page fault error. By the way this is a 1.4GHz Athlon, 1 gig of RAM, 80 gig hard drive & GEForce 32 Meg (DDR) AGP Video sytem with a 17"" Flat Panel display, not an old relic! There should be a zero star rating for something that flat out doesn't run."
1,Not so Great for an Older Computer,"I purchased this upgrade hoping to improve my Windows 98 speed. Instead, it slowed down CONSIDERABLY. For example, it took about 30 seconds to close 1 of 2 open windows. Very aggravating!I took my PC to a repair service and they tell me that XP is only good for Pentium IV processors; otherwise, Windows 98 is still better. I couldnt agree more!"
3,"Well, it could be a lot worse.","Do you have windows NT? Yes? Don't switch. Do you have windows 98/2000/ME? Switch.Windows XP runs off of the NT base and as such is much more efficient than previous releases of Windows. I would advise that when and/or if you get this version, you turn set it to visually run at peak performance, instead of the pretty looking stuff. I would take XP over ME/2000 any day of the week. XP is more stable (still not great), easier to use, less draining on my system and overall bigger pleasure to use."
5,You don't know what you are doing,"I don't blame all of you for giving this OS bad marks. God help you, you just don't know what you are doing..and that's ok. I've installed this OS on over 200 machines. It's by far one of the most stable OS's ever made. My users have never had a crash..not one. I'm talking about 150 people, using it 40 hours a week, all day long for 2 years. However....If I wasn't there, it would be a nightmare. With increase functionality come increased confusion. This is completely unavoidable. I understand that not everyone is a geek so I can see where people could really mess this up. It's ok, it's not your fault..but it's not Microsoft's either.Should you get a Mac with OSX? Absolutely. They make great software, and you should have a relatively easy time of it. However they are 2% of the market and if you want to go outside of the bounds of what they do you are going to have a big problem."
4,More stability to win ME users,"Though there aren't a ton of new feautes that make this the best windows ever. When comparing to windows ME there is. I have had this product since the first day it came out and have never seen a blue screen, something that always plagued me before. I haven't had any big problems, and that is what I call stability, when considering previous windows."
2,Xtra Painful,"Upgrading to XP has proven excrutiatingly painful. By the time I get used to this version and update all my drivers and programs, the next version will no doubt be released like a new strain of the plague. The law diminshing returns is upon us."
1,Warning this OS is totally unreliable,"Save yourself the headache and avoid windows XP. It lacks anything that approaches consistency. Sometimes your peripherals will work but generally they will not and if they do it will only be after fork out more money to get a program that might operate on XP. Just because you got it working this morning does not mean that it will function an hour later. THIS OPERATING SYSTEM IS SIMPLY NOT READY FOR RELEASE. Microsoft is more concerned about its image that its ability. If they had put as much into fixing their errors as they put into graphics and marketing this would be a much better product, one that might be worth buying."
1,Not as rosy as it looks!!,"I bought the upgrade thinking that they solved their previous bugs and I got disappointed. The way they do away with the crashes is this: it won't let you open more than a few windows at a time (in my case 5). also, I keep getting popping messages reminding me to check for updates and other junk (very annoying).After I updated to quiet down the messages, I got a frozen window. I had to do the usual CRT ALT DEL and it worked, but the window didn't dissapeared from the desktop. It was broken into pieces in the background and there was no way to get rid of it. I have to say that it has nice colors and a airport woman voice in their 'tour'. The repeating subliminal (windows) messages are all over the place enough to drive me crazy. One of their messages should say: warning, remove all baseball bats from your room before use."
1,I wish I had not installed Norton Internet Security 2002,"I am an average computer user. I understand most of the jargon, and so I tried to install XP myself on my Gateway Profile. I really wish I had not listened to the talk. I upgraded norton Internet Security to 2002. I tried to install my Amazon supplied XP. I found incompatabilities everywhere. Now I have no Norton Virus Protection.. I found it did not like my Linsys ethernet Card, which connects me through RoadRunner by Time Warner to the internet. Whoever you call (and Microsoft is really not an option), they all want to'pass the buck'The only way I have been able to get back to communication is by uninstalling XP. I still have no Norton Internet Security.I know this sounds like 'moaning', but frankly, it is not easy with my Gateway system and Time Warner to get any help. When things go wrong, you really need a friend and XP friends are in short supply."
4,A Worthwhile upgrade,"This version of Windows is rather impressive. After using it for a few days now, I am beginning to like it a lot. It is very user friendly, and, most importantly, it won't crash. A few of my programs will still crash, but they don't take Windows down with them. That is enough insentive to buy this in itself. The fact that it looks nicer and is easier to use are simply added bonuses. My qualms with it are that it is somewhat overpriced, and the product activation is a real drag if you want to upgrade more than one computer. It is supposed to prevent software piracy, but all it means for the home user is that you have to buy a new copy of the software for each computer you own. Aside from that, this is definetly a must-have upgrade (if your comp. meets the minimum requirements)."
3,Upgrade Caveat,"I purchased the upgrade version of this product with the intention of replacing my current WindowsME operating system on a Dell Dimension XPS B933. Windows ME had been factory installed at the time of purchase (December 2000). Although Microsoft sales literature states that Windows ME is an acceptable ""upgrade target,"" a successful upgrade could not be performed on my system. Microsoft Technical Support was, well, supportive, but they concluded that the upgrade setup program could not establish that my operating system (ME)was upgradable. Although the upgrade failure did not cause problems with my ME system, potential purchasers now running Windows ME should be aware of potential problems, and should attempt the upgrade well within the 30-day window for returning the product."
1,"A Costly Disaster -- Buy the Full, not the Upgrade","Installing this upgrade cost me about $500 because it caused my hard drive to crash, so I had to replace it and pay a professional to recover my data.In general, if you need to run Windows XP I would strongly recommend getting the Full version and reinstalling all your software because the upgrade causes serious problems."
4,Nice user interface,"I like the new design of the interface. All of the interface has now taken on web site type look and more graphics give it a slicker design. I have not seen this product under high stress loads of programming software and such. However, if it is built on the 2000 kernel, it should be pretty stable.God Bless"
1,Only get if pre-configured on NEW PC,"Well Micro$oft is trying to con us again.Most objective experts state there is no need to upgrade from Win98/95 to XP. In other words it offers no real advantage. While I am no fan of Microsoft, Win98 is ok and hardly ever gives me problems. Therefore I will go with the OBJECTIVE experts and when I upgrade my PIII I will get it preconfigured with XP until then well WIN98 will be just fine.PS. I dont know one person who has upgraded yet.(...)"
1,Very disappointed with XP,"I have to say I am very disappointed with Windows XP. I have not have had as many problems with an operating system as I have with XP. If XP thinks there is going to be a problem, the system goes Blue Screen and restarts the computer. I have been trying XP since it first came out, and have not been having any luck with it.Half of my programs will not work with XP, if you play any games, don't even bother getting XP. you will be lucky if it even will load up. When it does load up and you start getting into the game, it Blue Screens and restarts again.I have been trying and trying, I now uninstalled XP and went back to 98 Second Edition. I was just as disappointed with ME, but that at least did not crash anywhere near as much as XP. I would suggest either staying with 98 SE or go with 2000 PRO. I have 4 computers and I will stay with my Win2K PRO and 98SE. Until they come out with XP Second Edition, save yourself a lot of time and headache and don't bother with XP"
5,a good product overall,"With the introduction of XP, it is going to be harder and harder to switch or complain. Yes, we all know of the blue screen of death, but that happens so infrequently with XP that for all practical purposes, this is an operating system to be proud of. Most likely though it will be the app that crashes, and if that happens, you still have to exit the program and restart it. The programs most likely to crash are the big ones, and big problems take a long time to load. So it's almost like waiting for the computer to restart, and that means the time wasted is still the same, but at least it's not the operating system that crashed.XP home is nice and stable and I recommend it to anyone on Windows 98 or ME or earlier. XP is not that much different from Windows 2000 but cosmetically it offers a few nice enhancements."
1,I wish 'zero stars' were an option,"Microsoft's Windows XP (Home) is a grotesque redefinition of ""bloatware"", requiring 128 MB of memory to run, and almost 1 GB of disk space to install. (And, by the way, that space needs to be on the C: drive -- there's no obvious way to put it anywhere else.)The new ""features"" included in XP are laughable -- WOW !! I can have windows with rounded corners !!! The new licensing restrictions are important -- they are an excellent demonstration of the validity of the anti-trust case against Microsoft. Of course, if you really enjoy applying security patches, XP may suit you a treat.I have worked as a software engineer for almost thirty years (including some time working with the IETF), and I cannot recall a more awful piece of ..... software.If you need to have a Windows OS, try to get a copy of Win 2000, or Win NT 4.0."
1,"NO IIS, ASP user be aware","XP Home doesn't support IIS or PWS. Anyone wants to play with ASP/ASP .NET needs to pay extra $$ to upgrade to XP Pro. This ""minor"" missing information from XP Home and Pro feature matrix give me the wrong impression that XP is a superset of W2K... WRONG!!! (...)"
1,Not compatible for PC gamers&#65533; computers,"If you play computer games like me, don't get this operating system. This new Microsoft OS causes a lot of bugs to a bunch of old PC games and ""addons"" and ""mods"" that gamers make for their PC games. Maybe it's because some PC games are old and Windows XP is new. But stick with an older OS like Windows 98 if you intend to use your computer for PC games only. I never had any problems with some of my PC games in my old computer, which had Windows 98. Now I do with Windows XP when I bought a new computer."
4,Very Stable,"As previous reviewers have mentioned, you should make sure your hardware and software is XP compatible before you buy. Assuming everything is compatible Windows XP upgrade is a breeze to install, once installed it is very funtional and stable. The main irritation about previous Windows operating systems was the instability. My Windows XP installation has not crashed a single time since I installed 768 MB of Ram. For a stable system it is very important that you have enough Ram. When I only had 256 MB of ram installed the system was not much more stable than Windows 98 SE. I am very pleased with Windows XP, you will be too, if you have enough Ram, and XP Compatible software and hardware."
1,about 2 good songs,I listened to this cd and was sorely dissappointed. I loved the movie and the music in the movie. usually the songs that you listen to are in sequence with the movie and this was not. Not only that but the good songs that were in the movie were left out for some reason. I am not someone that is picky about her music either. I love music. I hate this cd.
5,cluless rules,"as a total fan of the movie i bought this soundtrack. It was the first cd i ever owned and is still one of my favorites! it's happy fun music that well reflects the movie. i own alot of soundtracks and this is one of the best put together ones by far.I think the song thati really miss not being n this ound track is ""tenderness"" because it's a good song and because it's played during one of the best momets of the movie. there are of course other songs missing missing and some i could do without but all in all the best soundtrack i own and that's alot"
3,Lacking but Entertaining,"Not only did they leave out Jewl's ""All By Myself,"" but they also left out a hard to find Cranberries song (""Turn Away""), and General Public's ""Tenderness"" which sets the tone for the movie's ending. For die hard Clueless fans like myself, there should be another soundtrack that captures more of the film's memories. Still, this one is good. I had a hard time deciding between 3 or 4 stars."
1,Worst Kindle book ever experienced,"OK, I really loved this novel. I wore out my paperback a while ago and was excited when I saw that it was back in print and even more pleased when I saw there was a Kindle edition. However, when I started reading it quickly became clear that this was scanned and either left unedited or the editor spent more time picking his nose than editing. There are mis-scans on every page. Words like 'die' convert to 'the,' the name Fuller converted to Poller -only sometimes, 'them' becomes 'mem' and on and on... I have never bothered with a review before. However, I care enough about this book that I felt I had to say something in the hopes that others are able to enjoy a truly excellent story. Save your money. Buy the actual book."
4,A Reckoning for Kings,It took a long time for delivery.It arrived 1 day before the deadline.Other than that pretty much OK.
1,Sony D-NS707F S2 Review,I wasn't happy with this unit as the controls are connected to a wrist strap that easily comes loose. Worse even was that I didn't even know this player had this arrangement as the pictures show the backside of the unit. No wonder! The only redeeming quality of the unit was the sound.
2,"Great for CD's, lousy with MP3's and ATRACS.","Pros:1. Long battery life.2. Decent sount (on CD's).3. Easy to read display.Cons:1. Plays first quarter of an MP3 fine, then it starts scratching and eventually stops.2. Plays first tenth of an ATRAC disk fine, then it starts scratching and eventually stops.3. Takes about 5 - 10 minutes (not seconds!) to read a MP3 disc before playing.4. Button placement makes it easier to use with your left hand rather than right.5. You have to press a button rather hard and long to make the function work.In other words, if you listen to the radio and CD's only - and are left handed, this is the perfect player for you!"
3,Hmmmm....,"There are so many ""Various Artist"" CD's out there you may want to shop around. Some of the songs which I like on this CD are also on other CD's. It was OK, but I could only relate to fewer than half of the songs. (I'm glad I got it on sale for less than eight dollars, so, at that price, I did get my money's worth.)"
2,Disappointed,"Based upon others' descriptions, I was really looking forward to getting this CD. I have to say that I found it on the boring side. I love tacky lounge music as much as the next person, but I just didn't like it as much as I expected I would. I'm not sure if I'll ever play it again. $12 down the toilet. Same for the bongo lounge CD too. :-("
3,Easy to read,"... but I was awaiting something else, a littbe bit different. This book gives you hope, guidelines, knowledge about soft skills, some ideas, a lot of humanity, but don't await a textbook for serious study. It was a good partner for a freezy weekend! LB"
5,Very Stable......and full of features,"I was very leary of using this Operating System (I have XP RC2 beta) but have really taken a liken to it. First off there is no need to buy any additional software. Firewall? built in. CD-Burning? built in. Movie Maker? built in. Did you use PC Anywhere? those feature and more are built in. The only thing that isnt included it an anti-virus program. Stability has been bar-none. I am a Windows 2000 Professional and Advanced Server user and can say that XP is even MORE stable than Windows 2000. I plan on buying XP for all of my computers, save the server. I will wait for .Net server to come out. Yes folks...XP is that good."
2,Not worth the price.,"Windows XP works quite well, it represents a considerable improvement in stability over Windows ME. The new look is visually pleasing though a little childish looking. However, it has two large drawbacks: the outrageous price and the restrictive license....The price has been steadily rising for new versions of the windows operating system and this version continues the trend. With profit margins of 95% or more (Ie they charge more than 20 times what it costs to make), you definitely should not buy this operating system at this price.The second issue is the restrictive license that comes with the operating system. Essentially Microsoft reserves the right to read your hard drives and change anything without warranty or limit, this has caused considerable damage to many peoples computers when the automatic update feature installed malfunctioning patches automatically disabling the computer.The verdict: Don't buy it unless you really need it."
3,Controversial and largely convincing reading,"Allegro may have been in the firing line for many of his extreme beliefs, but with this work he has done us all a great service. ""The Teacher of Light"" may or may not be Jesus. What Allegro does provide, is the air of expectancy that was around at the same time as the man we know as Jesus. Although, not a Chistian myself, I have just read the exceptional and inspiring ""THE Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing years"" by Richard G. Patton. Patton depicts a very human being against the background that Allegro sets. Anyone that makes us question should be applauded. Allegro does just that. Patton does it in spades. Highly recommended."
3,Detailed,"This book presents a comprehensive history of the mathematicians, mathematical academic life, and mathematical trends present in Poland during the first half of the 20th century. The book takes interest in the sudden flourishing of Polish mathematical thought during this period, and chronicles the extensive contributions of Polish mathematicians to topology, set theory, and analysis (functional analysis). It attempts to explain the conditions which led to the intellectual prosperity, and the conditions which allowed it to endure during the ravages of the two World Wars. The author presents detailed, often first-hand accounts, however, at points he becomes a bit monotonous as he tries to honor everyone from that time period. Overall, it is a good source to learn about the mathematical environment in Poland at the time, and to learn of the lives of such great mathematicians as Banach, Mazurkiewicz, Zaremba, Sierpinski, Kuratowski, Steinhaus, Knaster, Mostowski, and others."
5,"There hasn't been a review for this album in 7 years, SO...","This is my favorite Jimmy Eat World album. Not as ""perfect"" as Clarity, but that's one of its most attractive qualities. The vocals are harsher (and shared with Tom, who is a great singer), the songs less perfectly structured. But there is something about a band's first recordings, when the only thing fueling the music was passion.Static Prevails rocks hard when it rocks, but at at the same time manages to put you in a dreamlike stupor. That is one of the best things about Jimmy Eat World. No matter how aggressive the song, they always have a warm quality. Listening to this band is like being wrapped in a big musical blanket.Highlights of this album are Episode IV, World Is Static, Robot Factory, and the closer Anderson Mesa. This is probably my favorite album closer of all time, and is a song I could listen to on repeat for hours- subtle at the start and it builds up to an extremely powerful end."
2,what is the big deal,"ive heard so much about this band, and all the other reviews sound phenomenal. but i bought it along with the promise ring's nothing feels good, and next to that, static prevails sounds like just another pop album. i failed to find anything spectacular in this album, and therefore don't understand anything about emo, which i could have sworn JEW (jimmy eat world, heh heh) hailed itself as. nothing special. but i will give it another listen before throwing it out. if my opinion changes, you'll hear about it."
4,I really like this CD Emilio who?,"My mother in law gave me this cassette she bought in a pawn shop in Carson City. I listened to it until the tape broke then I bought the CD. I was wondering who Emilio was? I now have several of his CD's excellent up beat Tex/Mex mix. Have I told you lately that I love you in Spanish, is truly a beautiful song as sung by Emilio."
3,"It's not that great, but it's fun","If you can find this movie used or really cheap, it's a good deal. It's not the best transfer or the deepest story, but it's got action and a cool robot that destroys things. It's a bit short, but that's okay. If it were longer, it would probably need a better story to justify sitting through the whole thing. It's a fun, old-school anime for those who want just that."
3,Great animation but a bit too short on story and plot.,"This is a good ""starter anime"" that portrays what is possible in this genre. A decent story is brought to life through terrific animation and non-stop action. My only complaint is the length...or lack of. Rent it. Or buy it if you can find the rare combo version which packages Black Magic M-66 along with Riding Bean."
1,this movie is horrible,this is the worst movie manga ever made in the previews it look like it had a lot of action when i got home to see it i was very disapointed it was a boring triller i brought it back and exchanged it the same day
