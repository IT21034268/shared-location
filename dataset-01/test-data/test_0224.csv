4,Great Camera,"I really like the camera and am very satisfied. Only complaint is that the battery lasts barely 45 minutes and it takes a while to xfer the video into my computer for manipulation. Otherwise, plenty of features."
5,This is great!,"I love this video because you can take a look at Mariah at a time when she was not a household name. It gives you a chance to see her as she is at certain parts where the filming is reallly raw. This video also has some great live performances at a small club. ""Don't Play that Song for Me"" by Aretha Franklin is my favorite song she has covered to date. She also performs ""Vanishing"" at track that is the least ""produced"" song on her first album and really showcases her voice. This video is fun and great to watch a million times!"
4,Slipknot is great,"This is a good cd. It has 2 or 3 crappy songs, but most of them are enjoyable. For all those who say Nu-metal is a crap genre and that they hate it. Don't listen to it. Pretty easy solution, isn't it? I myself am a fan of alot of nu-metal bands such as system of a down, korn, and others. i also like other types of music like coldplay, yes, and The Who. its just a genre. some people like it and others don't. live with it"
4,Iowa - Slipknot,Pretty good compared to the last album (SLIPKNOT) . I was kind of surprised to see their come back. I have their two albums : SLIPKNOT and IOWA and both are not old for me.Yeah guitars are kind of used repeaditly but not alot. After listening to it the first time i thought the album sucked. But now after year or two its not bad. They don not sound like any other band present. Better than most.Favourite songs:People = Sh*tDisasterpieceEverything EndsI am HatedIowaThe last track IOWA is very long (about 14 mins.) but starting it with slow guitars and very slow vocals. After a while it becomes a very angry song.Overall one of the best Metal album present.
2,raw,"I can describe this album in 5 words. It's hard, raw, brutal, aggresiv and hateful. It's that brutal that it cuts in my bones everytime a listen to it, it's like a torture.But I can recommend this for guys that like this sort of brutal music. But I don't know if I should keep this album or sell it, cause I liked it before, now im tired of it. It whas once in a period that I like this sort of music and I still do it, but this album is just too hard. There latest album from 2004 is a lot better then this."
3,Not as good or innovative as the first album.,"I really liked slipknot's first album, really grinding guitars, somewhat complicated arrangements, and catchy lyrics. However this album has missed the mark. This album goes to fill the noisy rap-rock genre with drop tuned guitars, with whiny singing that eventually evolves into growling. They should have just stayed with the formula they had in the first album. I have a real bad feeling that they will end up like Korn and most of the other rap rockers, they all release a really good first album-a really tight arrangement, good melodies and songs- but then every follow up album is crap. If you want to hear some really good metalcore-the orgin of this genre which originated in the late 80's early 90', get some Anthrax(""persistence of time"") or Biohazard(""urban discipline"") which is real metal(no drop tuning or whiny growls). I guarantee you will not be disappointed with these two alternative suggestions."
4,hardcore slipknot fan,"Slipknot is more hardcore than ever. In my opinion thefirst album is better,but not by far. My favorite song on theirdebut album is spit it out. The second album is not quite as violent as the debut. Don't get me wrong Iowa has great songs such as""Disasterpiece"" and even my favorite ""People=Sh@*""If you like slipknot as much as I do than I guarentee you'll love this hardcore album IowaSlipknot Rules"
1,Worst Stuff I've Heard In Years!!!,"Any person who has the nerve to call this ""HEAVY METAL"" should be tied to a chair in front of a JCM-800 MARSHALL STACK turned all the way up(375 Watts) and be subjected to every single song off every album from every ""REAL"" THRASH/DEATH/SPEED METAL band out there for days untill they get it through there head that this band SUCKS!!! or untill they kill themselves"
1,A Joke?,"Don't waste your time on this cd or any from this genre if you want to listen to real metal. Mallcore is not metal. If you want to get into real metal, try prog, thrash, speed, death, melodic deeath, grind, power, black, or classic metal. Teenage angst-based immature lyrics, silly costumes, repetetive downtuned power chords, and mall rat fans all contribute to make Slipknot the pits."
5,HOW CAN'T YOU LOVE THIS CD??!!,"Wow!- These guys have really outdone themselves here. This isone pummeling, brutal METAL album- Not rap-rock, or nu-metal-it sounds more like death metal than anything. I'm a huge fan ofMeshuggah, Slayer, etc. but this is so much more FUN to crank up in the car. The drumming is AWESOME, as are the vocals.Some of the lyrics are stupid, but who cares? They removedjust about all traces of DJ's, rapping and kettle drum playingfrom the first CD and replaced it with pure agressive metal.I'm pretty hard to impress these days, but I love this frickin' CD. If you love HEAVY music, you will too."
4,INSANE!,"first off let me say that slipknot are an amazing band but this cd doesnt top the first one, IOWA is more of a NU metal cd than the first 1 this cd has amazing riffs and kick ass drums and vocals beyond this world GO buy this and the first 1 NOW!"
1,Iowa,"""for the last time, slipknot aint nu metal. theyre heavy as hell f---ing death metal. theyre lyrics arent along the lines of i hate my life its more like i wanna slit your throat and f--k the wound you dont c any p--sy numetal bands singin bout dat s--t.""Wow. The things Slipknot fans say never cease to amaze me. If you want a halfway decent numetal band, check out Mudvayne or Nothingface. If you really want ""heavy as hell death metal"" check out Kataklysm, Nile or Cryptopsy. You little hot topic kids are such morons."
1,SO BRUTAL..... SO HARDCORE...... NO F**KING SINGLES!,"Slipknot are incredible! They are the greatest band in the world... all that f-ing distortion, and three, yes, THREE percussionists... man... I can't begin to tell you how brutal these guys are! I mean, like, they keep saying the ""f"" word, and those lyrics, man, not at all whiney or always the same, so heavy...it really makes you FEEL the hate of these nine, ANGRY bstrds... yeah, they really have come such a long way since ""wait & bleed"" , songs like ""Left Behind"" shows that Slapcock are trying something TOTALLY different... man...they have so much more to offer than harmonies and gimmicks...SO brutal... SO hardcore... NO F-ING SINGLES... well maybe just a couple...?"
1,Total Insult To TRUE Metal,"Nowdays everyone thinks Slipknot is the heaviest, most evil, most aggressive band out there but Iowa is a complete disgrace. First off, the vocals SUCK. They are not evil, brutal, heavy, just a cheesy mess. Listen to Darkthrone, Morbid Angel, or Maniac of Mayhem and those are TRUE evil, brutal vocals. Also, the instrumental work is somewhat heavy but no good rhythm, and the drumming is awful. If you want TRUE metal DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!"
2,Essentially Sepultura with Mr. Bungle's masks.,"Folks, Slipknot's music is nothing fresh. Listen to Sepultura's ""Roots"" in the middle of both Slipknot albums...you'll seriously think it was all the same band. The singer's voice, the sampling, the percussionists, guitars, bass, etc., totally the same. ""Roots"" had much better production, so if you like groove-oriented metal, get that.Probably the best song on here is ""Gently"". Unfortunately, it's not original, either. It sounds remarkably similar to ""Exhale the Vile"" by Machine Head."
2,Where are Sid and Craig????,"If this CD had been released under the name of a different band, I would have absolutely loved it. But, as my subject says, where did Sid and Craig go? And, for that matter, Chris and Shawn? What happened to the ingenuity and creativity that filled the first album? I have only heard ""DJing"" on maybe two tracks, and no sampling except on a few select tracks. The lyrics are great, the drums kick...(as usual), and there are some great heavy guitars, but its missing the depth of the first album. By itself, a great album, but for Slipknot, mediocre."
1,Pathetic,"Slipknot is described in one word-awful. I agree with another reviewer on here where he said that this music isn't heavy, it's just garabage. If you want good heavy metal music check out Black Sabbath, Ozzy, Pantera, Slayer, Black Label Society and Iron Maiden or something like that. All those bands are great, this is just as I said-garbage.PS: one more thing. BANGING RANDOM POWER CHORDS ISN'T MUSIC! IT'S NOISE!"
3,Decent Metal CD,"I bought this CD on a whim, never having heard any of Slipknot's music before. I was tired of mainstream [music] that was being played to death on the So Cal rock stations and took a risk here. Well, I wasn't completely disappointed. There are some hardcore, rockin tracks on this CD. ""Everything Ends"", ""Heretic Anthem"", and ""I am Hated"" are definitely aimed at all the injustices that a person experiences in relationships of all sorts -- business, friendship, romantic, etc. The guitars are loud and twangy, the drumming is definitely solid. This is the stuff that was meant to be played at the highest possible volume while speeding down the highway.My only real complaint would be the lyrics of the songs themselves. Most of them don't make sense...and it's hard to get into a song when you constantly have to pull out the liner notes to decode what you're hearing. Music should be interpreted, enjoyed, and rocked out to...but not decoded. That takes the enjoyment out of it."
4,WELL....,"So, the 2dn Slipknot. Not as good as the 1rst. Is like the movies. A sequel might be good, but you are still sorry that you went to the movie theater instead of waiting it to come out in rental. For fans is a most have. For non-fans.....get someone to buy for you or something ;)"
2,well,"go listen to slayer or MH before you bother with slipknot. Slipknot is probably the most overrated band of all time. Yes they got some catchy songs here and there, ie People = s***, sic and eyeore. But other then that their crap. The whole mask/boiler suits stuff was a clear rip off of mushroomhead (who've been around alot longer then slipknot has) and the excess members is just plan retarted. They hardly use their dj or keyboardist and the 2 idiots that bang on beer kegs are just pointless. If they got rid of them and just had singer, bassist, 2 guitarist (mick is a fine guitar player) and a drummer (joey, who in the right style could tear s*** up) they'd be a force to reckon with. But that wont happen, so in the meantime go do yourself a favor, go back to what made thrash, slayer"
3,Who let the worms lose?,"Man, did these guys have a rude awakening or what...Yikes...I thought when I first heard this album. I have moved on in my ways, and you could say, mellowed out a bit, so this album didn't fit into the whole, 'let's chill and drink some beer' type attitude. I will say this. It is hard to stay an overly aggresive band such as this, without...erm...selling out. Whether you want to believe it or not...these guys are starting to sell out...they kept the sound...but look at them...the 'custom' made masks, the apperance on the new Rollerball movie...Now I do admire them for finding some great new talent in the new metal scene(Mudvayne is on a totally different level then these guys)...but Slipknot needs to come up with some better lyrics or something..."
5,AMAZING!!!,THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM EVER!!!!!THE MASKS R AWESUM ESP. CRAIG'SLEFT BEHIND AND I AM HATED R MY FAVOURITE SONGS!!!ALL U PPL WHO H8 SLIPKNOT U [stink]!!!!!!
3,Another Worthless Opinion,"I'm an extreme metal fan - you know, death, black, etc. etc. etc., and I have to admit I don't hate this album. Sure Slipknot is a commercial band, sure the masks are a gimmick, but musically they're probably the best representative of metal that have surfaced in the mainstream lately. The nu-metal vibe is there, but the occasional grind beat sneaks it's way in. Some of it seems genuinely angry, surprisingly - unlike many other bands in the pop rock genre that tend to sound no more than whiney at best. Yeah, not bad overall IMHO."
1,"If I could give this -infinity stars, I would.","This is absolute .... All of nu-metal is. Grown men scream and play the most terribly uninteresting guitar I have ever heard. Period. And they're ugly. This isn't music, and I sincerely hope nobody fools themselves or anybody else fools them into believing it is. If you want to call yourself a rock fan, then listen to real rock...."
1,How To Be Kiss,"Step 1: Put on masksStep 2: Make horrendous musicStep 3: Act like retardsThat is what Slipknot wanted and they succeeded. Now, people who want to be Kiss, do the same. It's that simple!"
1,Metal?,"I know this is not metal simply because metal does NOT get played on the radio or MTV. Honestly, the fact that its false, contrived music posing as metal does not really make me hate this band. Its okay to know that there are hundreds of heavier bands out there than the self proclaimed ""heaviest band in the world"". I hate this music for the same reasons I hate the Back Street Boys, Blink 182, or any of the other [junk] they play on the radio. It is boring, repetitive, dishonest, and lacks a single innovative or original idea. There is a lot of great music out there if you just put some effort into looking for it."
1,"Horrible group,horrible album","Think about it,if they had a ounce of talent,would they hide beneath those idiotic get-ups?"
3,. . . there goes [$$$},"People = shit is the only song that ever gets any space in my playlists these days. its nice aggressive stuff. the rest of the album loses potency as it drags on . . unimpressive riffs, predictable vocals. slipknot was always good for ""music to listen to when breaking [stuff]"" and this cd still is, but don't expect any epiphanies while listening to iowa. the cd is still fun to listen too because of the drumming (wow . . . just . . well wow. nice drumming man) and some of the ideas that james and mick execute with the guitars. they might as well axe the two 'percussionists' and the two dj electronica fags and bring the bassist into the music a bit more and focus their sound if they plan to release another cd. this is a cd that falls dangerously near to the limp bizkit/papa roach side of the 'music with heavy guitars' bin."
4,AWESOME FOLLOW UP!,"Trying to match the excellence of their first cd was an extremely hard task to do, but Slipknot almost managed to do it. I still like the first one a little better but that album is a classic and I've only listned to this album about 5 times. This album is much more heavier than the first one, some of the riffs and the vocals are on the death metal side , I don't recall any rapping, and there is a bit less singing. If you like Limp Bizkit , Staind, Linkin Park or any other kind of MTV rock I suggest you don't buy this album, but if you are into extreme hardcore metal definitely buy it!"
3,August 2001-best CD...March 2004-kinda old!,"Ah, August 2001-I got up early just to buy this record. How excited I was! And it was worth it! The explosive sound just blew me away! They were by far my favourite band! Their look was just waaay cool, and I just loved 'em! Hell, people at school took the piss out of me for liking them, but I just ignored 'em. I was just besotted with every track on this CD.2 and a half years on, however, that interest has kinda faded. Hell, they are still a decent band, but they are nowhere near as good as Maiden and Metallica. Slipknot were good for a while, but,to be honest, the hype of metal around the 2001/2002 period has gone for good.Slipknot are still a good band,but,like it or not, they are a band with a lot of pros and a lot of cons."
2,Slipknot's 2 minutes are up,"I loved thier first album, but they are flat out lying when said it would destroy that effort. Not even close. One thing I can't stand about them is how they never give Slayer any credit for ripping them off. This isn't cutting edge music folks!! This was cool in the mid 80's. Slipknot just turns it upside down and makes it look new. You can't make death metal mainstream, not saying that this is death metal. Releasing ""Left Behind"" further show a bad attempt at getting more $. But then again it's RR, who need to be put out of buisness for their recent decisions. This band is a gimmick. It doesn't take 9 people to do what they do, they just aren't competent to do so. And the lyrics sound like nursery rymes. ""If your 555 than I'm 666"" what is that? If you want real death metal get something from Dilinger Escape Plan or Nothingface. I hope that this is the album that launches Slipknot back to iowa where they came from, because I'm tired of hearing about them."
5,Iowa Good Cd but not the Best,"""Iowa"" newest cd by slipknot is good and all but at the same time is weirder than the first and second. It has a more slower evil feal than the ones before. If your a Fan or just like evil songs get this cd. Even though your not a fan still get this cd it will make you a fan of slipknot."
4,Lebanon native enjoys hometown film,"A great movie set in my hometown . The story of a returning native who comes to except his past and meets some unusual characters on his journey to find his and their futures with a mixture of laughter,heart,and an an unplanned pregnancy . A great character driven story with a variety of mispronounced words only a native would notice. Sit back and enjoy -you won't be disappointed!"
2,A Total Surprise,"I was expecting an interesting, thoughtful, well-balanced movie about relationships. I was completely surprised to find that it was nothing more than a pro-abortion movie disguised as a mainstream movie. Every pro-abortion person in the movie is portrayed as intelligent and multi-dimensional, and every pro-life person is portrayed as a one-dimensional moron.When the idea of adoption comes up, the movie uses the tired old line of ""not wanting to bring another unwanted baby into the world,"" completely ignoring the fact that there are tens of thousands of couples in this country desperately wanting to adopt babies every year, but, since there are simply not enough babies available for adoption, these couples finally end up adopting babies from other countries.And, as is common in so many movies, the ""star"" ends up seducing a married woman and destroying her marriage, and yet we are still supposed to see him as the ""good guy."""
3,Returned twice!!,"The product is effective, but the two times I have ordered, I have had to request a replacement product. Both times the seal was broken and there was no scoop in the package. I requested a replacement, and the seal was sealed and there was a scoop. Not sure why an open product would be shipped? Not sure if I will order again..."
4,Cute shoes!,"I got these shoes in the navy color, and they are really cute. The leather is soft and they will look very good dressed down with jeans, or they could be worn to the office, too. Good bargain price, and it's hard to find a nice and different pair of navy shoes, so I'm very pleased with them."
4,Trivia Tip - Ma Barker Episode,"Look for future Oscar winner Louise Fletcher (""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"") as the girlfriend in episode 4, ""Ma Barker and her Boys.""Of course, Elliot Ness had nothing whatever to do with tracking down the Barkers, and this episode infuriated J. Edgar Hoover. Hoover insisted that Desilu insert a disclaimer over the end credits stating that the FBI was the lead agency on the Barker case. I remember hearing this disclaimer when I first saw this episode, but it has been left off of the DVD version.Despite the absurdity of putting Ness in the story, it's an excellent episode that seems to anticipate the feel of ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" which would revolutionize American cinema eight years later."
3,could've have been better,There were other shows that were better than the ones you've choosen to have the public to see.
4,Historical Fiction At It's Best,"Slightly reminiscent of 'Devil In White City', but a much easier read. You get a lot of history without too much minutia.Set in turn of the century New York City, the author does a nice job of giving you a feel for the city and the era. Strong characters and intriguing subject matter kept my interest and there were enough twists and turns in the story to keep the pages turning.If anyone is a bit squeamish, I would suggest another selection as this book does contain graphic description of some brutal murders and discusses quite freely the lives of 'boy whores' and those who exploited them in the seedy parts of the city."
4,Very entertaining... unique historical perspective,"I was looking for a quick, easy read for an upcoming trip, and I found The Alienist at the train station. I wasn't expecting a great book, but I was pleasantly suprized with the book. I found the tone and descriptions of 19th century New York fascinating and throughly enjoyable. It was a fairly typical (serial)murder mystery, and I agree with others who have stated that the characters were underdeveloped. I was really expecting a suprize ending, and I was a bit dissapointed with no real twist at the end. However, the characters are interesting and the mystery plot kept me interested. Definetly worth it."
4,Dark & Thrilling,"A THRILLING novel! Character development was top-notch, the plot's twists and turns were delightful and I so enjoyed getting to know OLD NYC. I could picture the streets, buildings, and rooftops perfectly just as the author described. And those delicious late-night, secret meetings at Delmonico's made for wonderful intrigue (and a run to my wine rack). I look forward to reading Angel of Darkness. Thanks to E.D. for recommending."
3,Carr should forget mysteries,"I love history. I especially love New York history since I was born there. That was part of the appeal to me of the book. And that part of the novel did not dissapoint me. Carr has all the knowledge of turn of the century NY and can present the feeling and look of the city flawlessly. What he can't do is make an exciting mystery, which is what he intended to do. The idea is intriguing. A late 1800's serial killer on the loose in NYC. And the historical figures we meet on the way (Teddy Roosevelt, J.P. Morgan), make the book more enjoyable. But the plot is not up to snuff. The plot just seemed like a vehichle for Carr to expound all of his fancy vernacular and knowledge of old NYC. In the end that was the downfall of the book. Better than most efforts out there, but not the great book most will lead you to believe."
3,Good book but pump yourself with caffeine before you start !,"Caleb Carr does a nice job of writing an interesting story about a serial killer hunting children. Even though the plot was good enough, carr's writing is just too tedious to read. I dozed off atleast 3-4 times before i finished this book. There seemed to have been a deliberate attempt at elongating portions of the story. I'd have rated it atleast a 4 if carr had reduced the book by 200 pages. Even though the novel is quite voluminous, the characters don't seem to take off till the end. But do read it for carr paints a nice picture of new york a century back and manages to keep the plot interesting enough to tolerate the ordeal of reading it."
4,A slightly different New York,"One of the most well-researched, intelligently written books of historical fiction on the shelves. Carr not only utilizes the budding sciences of criminal psychology and forensics, but he presents each method as seen through the eyes of those living in the 1890's when both were considered new developments. He successfully mimicks the style of the day, which is often longwinded and wordy, but at the same time poetic and lyrical. The descriptions of old New York, particularly the dangerous, back-alley tenement ghettos, the subculture of police corruption, and the Victorian decadence once known as the ""sporting life"" are written so well that it's hard to believe Carr wasn't actually there to witness it all firsthand. Definitely recommended, and a good hook for the sequel, Angel of Darkness."
1,Disappointed,"I am very disappointed in the condition of this book. The top of the book has mildew type stains on it and the cover edges are wrinkled. I believe the wrinkling was caused by the seller putting it in a packaging envelope that was too small so the top edge got wrinkled when it was put in the envelope or during mailing. This book is supposed to be a gift, but I hesitate to give it now. I have ordered books in the past that were rated good and I was always comfortable giving as a gift...not sure on this one."
3,"An interesting premise, but too drawn out...","I was intrigued by the idea of an ""alienist"" trying to solve a series of murders in New York in 1896. Mr. Carr does present an interesting sort of period piece, but the book was too long (600 pages), the characters not well developed, and the style too ordinary."
5,Gripping and Insightful,"Both a fictionalized social history and a gripping murder-mystery thriller, ""The Alienist"" slowly draws the reader in then doesn't let go."
3,A solid first novel fo Carr...,Reads like a Hollywood movie production. The pace is fast and the plot gripping and exciting. Carr has crafted an exciting movie script and fitted it in a book. However the book is somewhat too long and the characters flat and 2-D. The finish was a little anti-climatic and disappointing.
2,hoping for a terrifying romp I found predictability.,"Beginning with great promise and drama at the funeral of President Teddy, I was quickly drawn into this well researched historical novel. Carr is best when he sets the mood of an East Village tenement in 1896, or sending his detectives through the horrors of Bellevue. However, his murder mystery and character development became sorrowfully predictable after a few chapters. An excellent reference for turn-of-the-century amateur NYC historians, but a disappoiting novel--in fairness, I read this book immedaitely after CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, a work hard to shine against in its dark, complex wanderings through a schismatic mind"
3,"Though this is a well researched book, it failed as a story.","This book reminds me of Sherlock Holmes. The book is intellectually well written, but it failed to evoke the reader's emotions felt for the characters in the book. The alienist is too occupied with his theories whilst others did the real job for him. The development of characters becomes weaker due to the much precise in details of background informations and technical issues of how to detect a crime. It also results in slowing down the intensity of the story. The writing style is rather slow and deteched in the way of describing the characters and events. The killer becomes less freightening by somehow degrading him into a simple psychopathatic being in the end. He deserves more of his own grounds instead of some staggering manners. I hope that next books of Mr. Carr will be less technical and with more human enough characters that makes the reader to forget it's only a fiction."
1,Great-IF YOU HAVE INSOMNIA,"The storyline sounds fascinating..you try and try to get caught up in it but the book is way too too detailed & extremely slow moving, I found myself nodding off a few times & stuck on the same paragraph. If you have trouble sleeping this is the book for you. A waste of time and money."
1,Pretty lousy,"I just had to add to the list of those who found this book tediously predictable, sophomorically written, and seriously boring."
3,You can't judge 'The Alienist' by its cover.,"The most intriguing part of The Alienist is it's catchy title, and its dark, mysterious cover. Despite the graphic details of the murders, and the mildly interesting historical content, the actual plot of the book never lives up the the sinister feel established by the title and cover photograph. Don't get me wrong, it's not really bad, after all I was interested enough to finish the thing, it just sort of fizzled out. I tired quickly of the authors' attempt to make me sympathize with the pitiful, abused, child killer.The the author must have watched too many episodes of the TV show ""Profiler"" when he devised his explanation of how the killer was apprehended. Left to the investigative techniques of Mr. Moore and Dr. Kreizler, the killer would have died of boredom long before he was ever caught!"
5,"Amazing, the way Carr is able to combine history and fiction","Caleb Carr has created an amazing piece of work! I read this book on the subways and in the parks of downtown NYC. Incredible, how the imagery that this historian depicts applied with the existing areas of NYC, it has been an incredible experience. I found myself dining at Delmonico's in order to close the last chapter. If you are of the weak hearted just close your eyes for a few pages. This is a book you WON'T want to miss!"
5,Excellently written novel,This was one of the best books that I have read recently. It kept me guessing all the way through to the end. I really liked the characters and I intend to buy the sequel to this book. The book was filled with suspense and I just couldn't put it down. This was just a superbly written book.
3,"An accurate picture of New York, but what about the story?","""The Alienist"" tells a fast-paced story--the problem is, the novel can't keep up with the action. The plot is deep enough without the EXTREMELY detailed, almost tedious description of the city and the psychological ""breakthroughs"" of the time. I felt like I was watching ""Cops,"" but the camera kept stopping on whatever landmark got in the way of the action. I realize that Carr has a degree in history, but some of the paperback's 597 pages could have developed the characters instead of acting as a travel book for the Lower East Side."
2,I really wanted to like this book,"I love New York and any stories that take place there, especially old New York, and I heard Caleb Carr speak recently on CSPAN and was very impressed with his knowledge of history and politics. I had picked this book up 3 times prior and just could not get into it ( this was about 3 years ago) , so after seeing him on CSPAN I thought I would try it again. I did get halfway through, but to me, his writing was dry and uninvolving. I just could not get a feel for the characters or situations. Basically I was bored. As much as I wanted to like the book I just didnt care.I would instead recommend, if you are like me and want to read more books about old New York to stick with Edith Wharton and E.L. Doctorow ( Ragtime, one of the greatest books and is historical fiction )"
1,"Long, constipated, and boring -- Sherlock Holmes-ish.",How in the world did this become a best seller??
3,"good plot, but...","I like the pemise of teh book and the plot line. The big problem that I had with this book is that the characters all seemed like people from today and not from the time of the book, their thoughts and actions kept reminding me about today. This problem nagged at me the whole time I was reading."
3,"Good start, fair development, poor ending","DEscription of turn of the century New York is very good, but you don't buy a mystery book for historical data. Characters are not fully developed and the ending really frustrates you. It can make a good movie though, if some of the slow parts of the book are corrected in the script."
4,"Plot almost secondary to rich, descriptive tapestry.","As a fan of historical novels (like ""Ragtime"" and ""The Road to Wellville""), I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Carr's expert descriptions of America in 1896. While the murders are indeed shocking (though not much worse than a typical ""X-Files""), I was most intrigued by his mingling of real and fictional characters, his descriptions of 19th century America, and how the protagonists used early, ""experimental"" types of forensics, such as fingerprinting, and psychological profiling. I too thought the final third to be a bit long, but really enjoyed getting the chance to experience 1890's New York as though being there."
2,Typical,The only reason I gave this book a three is because it seems Caleb Carr put alot of work into it. The results are terrible though. I found this book to be like every other Hollywood bullshit movie. Suspense..suspense..and....=)Happy ending=)Terrible read with its tedious sub plots and much to typical.
4,The first and best,"Caleb Carr's introduction to his motley crew of detectives is truly better than his later work, ""Angel of Darkness."" I found his descriptions of old New York thrilling and mesmerizing. Teddy Roosevelt as Cheif of Police--what a wonderful character! Kreisler, Moore, Steevie, Cyrus, and the awful, sad Beacham--you too will be engrossed by these people. Carr's nrrative style is somewhat choppy at times, otherwise this would rate 5 times."
4,Captures the Era,"I'm a huge fan of historical fiction - and as an author myself I know what it takes to do enough research to accurately capture a specific place in a specific time period. This author does it admirably. The author (to his credit) took the time to slowly build the story and the characters until I felt like 1) I was in New York of the 1900s, and I knew the characters well. Whether you're a fan of the mystery novel, the thriller, historical fiction, the whodunnit, or human psychology, give this novel a read - it's well worth it."
1,julien325,I have loved every Taylor Caldwell novel I've read since I was a teen. But I found this one to be very depressing. I find the character Dan Hendricks unfathonable and unreal. I have never come across a person like that in real life. He's almost like a sociopath without really being one. His friend Jim is bland as are all the rest of the characters. I never got to care for them.
3,"Pretty good, but can easily lead someone to legalism","As someone who's read a ton of these books (IKDG, I Gave Dating a Chance, Boy Meets Girl, Lady in Waiting, etc etc etc!), this is a book that has a great purpose, but is on the borderline. The problem with the Ten Commandments of Dating is that it's easy (and tempting) for people to fall into thinking that these are a sure-fire way to be okay. They're not. Only relying fully on God can get you anywhere. But the fact is that these ARE important considerations, and when these rules are kept with the right frame of mind/heart/spirit, you're much better off."
4,"Excellent, descriptive , touching commentary on village life","From the beginning I was encouraged to attempt silently the correct pronunciation of the Polish names , a task I found added to my enjoyment of a highly observant and pertinent novel with commentary on life in a small village . Stimulating, provocative and highly readable, I thoroughly recommend this work."
5,Very pleased,This game was difficult to locate and Amazon was able to locate it and get it to me before Christmas.
4,Fun variation on the Sims,"My Sims is not like a normal Sims game. Personally, I love the anime style, and relaxed game play. You work on tasks you want to do, instead of trying to make sure your Sim stays happy and alive in previous games. You design houses, furniature, and decorate, as well as collect ""essences"" that are used to do pretty much all of the above. You ask new Sims to move into your town. The music is pleasant, and the ""voices"" of the Sims is adorable. It would have been nice if this game was wifi compatable, but it is not. I also was a bit disappointed with the number and amount of loading times for a wii game. However, its overall a cute game, that has been keeping me entertained. If you like games such as Animal Crossing, where you basically chat with neighbors, collect things, and customize your pad, you'll probably enjoy it. :)"
5,great best of CD,I love early Leon. This has a good mix of his hits and his voice is spot on. I would suggest this cd to anyone who wants to get a good taste of Leon Russell.
4,a celebration of beefcake,"A walk through history with some of the hottest men ever to grace the silver screen from the silent era through to the present day. Author Michael Ferguson celebrates approximately 90 Hollywood Hunks. Its not meant to be a serious biography of each star represented, rather an irreverent overview of their appeal to gay men and straight women alike.I loved every page of it and time and time again agreed with the observations and choices.great bring on volume 2."
2,No auto shutoff,"It's a heating pad. It works. The cover could be softer. MY big mistake was not double checking that it had auto shutoff. It should have this feature, our older Sunbeam model has it! The new design controller works well. I only gave it two because the missing feature should be a deal killer. If you fall asleep with it it could burn you. It should be a standard feature on any heating pad marketed TOWARDS seniors!!!!"
1,Not patent leather,"As others have pointed out, these are not patent leather. They are patent PVC, which is much less breathable and less comfortable."
3,Good shoes,"They are good shoes, nice looking but they are a little tight on my feet. I thought that I had given myself extra room by ordering a half size bigger than my normal shoe size."
5,I love these Chef's Classic pots and pans!!!,"As with my Chef's Classic 14 piece set, this saucier is great. I was surprised that it was bigger than I expected, really not much smaller than the 1qt sauce pan. I assume the inward curvature of the saucier's bottom is where it where it loses the other 2 cups compared to the sauce pans squared off bottom. It has the same diameter which could work with the same lid if one needed to cover the saucier.I absolutely love how easy this Cuisinart line cleans up. No more soaking stuck-on food. The only warning for these would be to remember to check around the rivets inside the pans while washing (I hand wash) as food sometimes sticks to the rivets.I love these pans!!!"
3,good pan to have in the kitchen!,This pan is not great but it is handy for many uses in the kitchen. I might recommend it to a friend.
4,Larger than 1 quart,"I received my Cuisinart 1-quart nonstick saucier from Amazon today and was immediately struck by the fact it appeared almost identical in size to my 1.5-quart Cuisinart nonstick saucepan. I carefully checked the volume and determined it actually holds just a tad less than 1.5 quarts. For all practical purposes, this is the 1.5-quart saucepan with a pour spout and no lid. The dimensions are so close that the glass cover for the 1.5-quart saucepan fits on the ""1-quart"" saucier."
2,GOOD WHILE IT LASTED,"I've probably used this drill 5 time total. Mostly drilling holes in studs for electrical wire. I expect for $155 that the drll would last a lot longer. Didn't abuse it, or drill through nails. As soon as I started doing one inch holes the gears started to slip and that was that. If your doing small holes this drill is for you, otherwise use a half inch drill because this drill wont last very long."
4,I am Third review,"I Am Third was a very good book about the life of Gale Sayers. As a child, Gale Sayers was a very athletically gifted kid. The only problem was, he grew up in a very poor neighborhood. With the support of his friends and family, he went on to play college football at the University of Kansas, and eventually become one of the greatest NFL running backs ever. This book was a great story about overcoming obstacles to reach your ultimate dream. After his football career, he became a succesful businessman and was the athletic director at Southern Illinois. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes football and inspirational books.I Am Third (TV tie-in): The Inspiration for Brian's Song"
5,good and solid,"I've not had it very long, but it seems very well-made and does the job. I haven't yet used it, but the attachment to hold the sander upside down promises to greatly add to its versatility and will temporarily hold me over until I can afford a floor standing belt sander. The fence attachment has been back-ordered, but also seems to be a good option. The sander comes with one 80 grit belt. Some have complained about its weight, but I don't find it too much. One does need to be very careful not to take off too much material. This sander seems to be one very good addition to an arsenal of sanders of various types one needs for various projects and I surely recommend it. I seriously considered getting the 4"" Porter Cable version, but the reviews tipped me towards this Bosch sander."
5,Touched by an Angel Touches Again!,"I have all 4 seasons now. Again, I was blessed by the content, accurate portrayal of humans in many circumstances, and the fact that angels are watching--waiting to help."
5,it's like a custom cast,"When I was younger, all the kids who had broken bones got white plaster casts - nowadays, they have all sorts of colorful models to choose from to make a broken bone not an entirely negative experience.Whether your dog has been injured or has just come back from spay or neuter surgery, these ""Elizabethan Collars"" are a great way to keep them from biting and chewing at a wound or stitches, but still enabling them to see where they are going and to easily access their food and water. Having different color options is great - these were originally only available in clear in the past, so the dog could see the stitches, but not reach them. Dogs can only see muted colors at best, but there's nothing wrong with their owners wanting to color-coordinate."
3,One screw and it's a Paper Weight.,"On all Bosch random orbital sanders there's a small screw that holds in the hook pad. They can vibrate out over time, or break off as the one on my Bosch did. The only reason this is a problem is that the screw is a low profile metric machine screw and impossible to find in the U.S.For model 3283 DVS the part number is DIN 7984 M6 x 16-10.9I like the sander, but one unavailable screw shouldn't turn a power tool into a paper weight."
5,Great Deal.,"Nice Hitch. The dealer wanted 2.5 times the price plus an hour labor. Same item. Took ten minutes to put on. Fits the 2012 Frontier, although when I bought it, it only said up to the 2011.The bolts are stuffed in the frame. Initially thought they forgot them."
2,Short of PHP Database Content,"I'm sorry to disappoint the previous 3 reviewers (and I know I am late to the game), but only buy this book used. It has 7 chapters coverage on SQL which by itself is not bad, but if I wanted a SQL book I would buy one. When it says Beginning Databases - I would expect a lot more. It spends one or two chapters on Pear. It has no chapters on ODBC and doesn't cover the differences between working with PHP and databases like mySQL, MSSQL and Oracle (and others). It does cover XML which I haven't looked at yet because I am most interested in ODBC and Pear at this point and picking a database to develop with. It does have a summary on different databases that might prove to be helpful."
5,well-sized for the little ones,"This mouse is just the right size for children just starting to play with computers and is ideally sized/shaped for their smaller hands. The buttons and mouse work with gentle pressure as well and aren't too hard to use. The only concern I have (unfounded as of yet) is that the USB cord looks somewhat delicate, so i don't know how well it would survive an accidental tug or trip-over..."
4,The Facts of Amish Life,More and more people can't afford to live in today's world. Most Americans still don't have a TV. They got rocked by these metal bands.
1,This could have been a lot better,This is the worst McMurtry yet. There are far too many one-dimensional characters and improbable happenings. The five-year old boy is like a sitcom kid from a WB show and you just want to wring his neck. Very disappointing.
2,Light weight is best description,"Pro:It's Light weight makes it good for vertical or overhead sanding.Dust collection is good as long as it is not clogged.Con:Switch quit working after 3 months, under warranty I should have had it replaced, instead I thought the same thing would happen again since it was the dust from sanding, so I installed a toggle switch instead.Variable speed made little difference to speed, I brought it in for service thinking it was defective, no it was fine.Dust exhaust clogs easily and is hard to clean out.Belt removal is difficult, just make sure you do your bench curls everyday.Motor will not hold up to heavy pressure.Would help if front handle removal was tool free.Summary:The most overrated tool on Amazon."
5,An excellent sander,"I've had this sander for about a year now and am very pleased with it. It has performed excellently from fine sanding for refinishing doors to rough sanding of plywood. The variable speed feature comes in handy, especially for the fine sanding work. Belt changing and tracking is a breeze. Being able to flip it upside down onto its flat top gives it some double-duty use as a tabletop sander. As well, being able to remove the front handle gives better access in tight areas. The dust collection bag is, however, worthless and you should just expect not to use it. Either hook it up to a dust collection system or leave it open and make sure it points away from you. A carrying case wasn't included, but would have been nice. Overall, though, a very nice sander for the price and I would recommended it to anyone."
3,Not impressed with initial impression,"My first impression is this package has been previously opened. After plugging in for the first time, saw dust blew out.... obviously get someone's returned product. Not blown away with appearance. Sent back for Makita instead...hopefully this will be new as advertised."
2,Premature death,"Bosch 1274DVS 6.6 Amp 3-Inch by 21-Inch Variable Speed In-Line Belt Sander with Cloth Dust BagI don't especially pamper or abuse my tools but this sander died after 18 months. Several of my favorite tools are Bosch so we started out on good terms. However the dust collector plugged up early on and I couldn't get it to work again. Then the tracking quit adjusting. Finally it just stopped in the middle of sanding a big table top, maybe overheated? It's in the trash and I returned to my tired old Makita."
2,Unengaging,"I was disappointed in this novel with its layers upon layers of women and their daughters - chains rather than layers. And one of the women - shock, horror - had invested her hopes in her son who mysteriously disengages himself from the family. Of course I tried not to be influenced by the feminine in the message - and I have read many women writers (Anna Kavan is one of my favourite dozen writers and 'Let Me Alone' one of my top ten novels) - but I found myself trying to suppress the masculine in me, trying not to object to the way many men are portrayed in this novel.In the end there were too many tears, too many disappointments, not enough mathematics, too many twists and turns, too many identical viewpoints. I have never actually attended a mathematics convention (and I wonder if Ms Woolfe has either), but I found the one described in 'Leaning towards Infinity' totally unconvincing."
4,Lessons in Living,"In our lives, obstacles arise every step of the way. Character and quality of life is determined by how we deal with them. Kim Norris Samuels has found the perfect means of sharing a serious, challenging life experience in a wonderful, humorous manner. Reading that so easily holds your attention from beginning to end. The best description of content is.... Hurricanes, Paradise and Fairy Tales."
2,Bad in theory,The original vinyl pressing was fun and sounded great. The CD version takes away a LOT of the quality. Get the vinyl if you can find it.
1,BLUE LIGHT--an imitation of SCORPION SHARDS?,"I bought this book because it seemed to remind me of a book I'd read long ago...and BLUE LIGHT is, indeed, suspiciously similiar to the plot of the SCORPION SHARDS trilogy by Neal Shusterman. With a few superficial differences--change the name of the ""Thief of Souls"" into the ""Grey Man"", change the number of people/things recieving the Star-shards...there's way too much similiarity.If you're going to read one of these 2 books, definitely check out SCORPION SHARDS by Neal Shusterman first."
4,Should have been a 5 Star book!!,"Walter Mosley is a wordsmith of the highest quality, and his prodigious skills are on display throughout Blue Light.As you read the opening of this book, you will be sucked into the narrator's mind. You feel his anguish, you revel in his discoveries, you fear for his safety.This book has a wonderful premise: A light falls from the sky, imbueing everyone who lays eyes upon it with wonderful powers. I won't describe any more of the plot to you because a large part of the enjoyment factor of this book is experiencing the ebb and flow of the plot.One thing kept me from awarding this book the five star treatment. The book ends in an obvious cliffhanger. Granted, Mosley does wrap up the story in a satifying manner. Granted, most sci-fi books work under the trilogy pattern. Still, I would have felt less used if this book would have ended a little less . . . maniputively."
1,Forced and unnecessarily disgusting read,"This book is not what the cover and reviews promise, I enjoysci-fi books, but this book was forced and a pointless read. I will never read another Mosley book again! There goes five hours of my life I will never get back! If you feel the need to read this book, I beg you, warn you----don't do it, please! I mean Gray Man---get real! (if I could give it negative five stars I would)"
2,Slow.Very different for this author. Not his usual stuff.,"I am a good story ""listener"", i.e., tell me a good story and I am yours. This one didn't grab or hold my attention like any of his remaining works have. It seemed to be a narrative of a group of semi-wooden characters reacting to a situation (the blue light) rather than a story about humans. I am a SF AND a Mystery fan but I found this slow and somewhat annoying. In other words it had the ""so"" but not the ""so what"". Skip it unless you have nothing better to do."
4,what price gouging,this product is no longer being provided by Chanel but that is no excuse for charging almost 3 times it's original cost.
1,"Stupid Design, can't flush sand with it. Bosch blew it.","The picture shown for this sander shows a sander able to flush sand to the belt side of the sander. This error caused me to purchase this rediculously designed belt sander. Bosch, I have normally loved their tools. But this makes me feel like never buying another bosch tool again. Instead of redesigning the sander and motor housing for the 3x24 belt, they used the same frame and body with different rollers and platina for the 4"" wide sander to save them design costs and changes. So what does this do,, yep, leaves a full one inch over hang of the motor housing over the belt.. How STUPID. you think they could have at least modified it to push the rollers and platina out to the side so it would be flush like the 4 inchers. but no. If you want a tool designed to save Bosch money and with no care as to the end user,, you or me,, then buy this piece of garbage."
4,A very pleasant sound from an underrated group!,"I grew up in the Fort Lee, NJ area, literally down the road from the Royal Teens. Consequently I was able to get access to a liberal sampling of their music. I must heartily agree with the last reviewer regarding ""Believe Me"". The song should have easily been a national top 10 hit but for some unexplained reason stalled outside of the New York/New Jersey area. It's very reminiscent of ""Little Star"" but different enough to stand on it's own merits as a doowop classic.I've always been particularly impressed by the Royal Teens' sax-flavored instrumentals and two excellent ones are featured in this short compilation (""Sham Rock"" & ""Royal Blue""). With only twelve tracks this is not an ideal ""Best of"" collection. I missed songs like ""Leotards"" (an obvious attempt to cash in again on ""Short Shorts""), ""Big Name Button"" (another gimmick tune) and ""Harvey's Got A Girlfiend"". All in all, a vastly underrated group stuck with the ""one hit wonder"" label."
2,Widescreen edition preferred to accomodate plot holes,"My suspicion that this film was mainly a ""rah rah"" piece for the U.N. is shared by several of my fellow reviewers. I hope that is the case so any who put work into ""The Interpreter"" can say they at least accomplished something. A really good spy thriller will maintain a nagging sense in the back of your mind that there is something amiss but keeps the action coming so you won't have an idle moment to ponder it. At the very end, the final piece of the puzzle will drop into place just in time to roll credits.In this movie, that nagging detail is so glaringly obvious that a non-stop chase scene couldn't mask it and there are no chase scenes in this movie worthy of the name. Staggering coincidences are required every few minutes to keep the plot moving. When the details of the nefarious conspiracy are revealed, the viewer is left thinking ""really, that's it? They went to all that trouble for that?"""
1,"Nicole Kidman is always beautiful , even in this terrible film . . .","It takes itself a bit too seriously. The casting is far stretched also. A silly piece of work.Halle Berry would have been perfect in the role of Sylvia, but Nicole Kidman? She is supposedly African, with an African lover, and in all the photographs within the movie and among all the other people shown as her countrymen in the USA, she is the only one who is not black.There is no credibility on any count, whether the casting or the very, very weak story. Neither are the views of Manhattan, particularly in the last scene where it looks like a pastel backdrop rather than a view of the east side of the island. A waste of time, except for watching Nicole Kidman, one of the most beautiful people on the screen today."
2,Boring and stupid.....what a waste of talent!,"The only thing to recommend about this film is the ""director's commentary"" in the extras section - where the director ""pontificates"" about how ""hard"" movies are to make and to be ""releasable"" - which the irony is - this film is so awful it should have been shelved. Gone are Syndey's good days as a viable filmmaker (Kubrick he's not)! The casting is terrible (absolutely no chemistry between Kidman and Penn) and the screenplay is completely inane and impossible to follow. This is definitely one for the Mystery 3000 boys! Everyone collected their checks on this one - zero craft - zero film!"
1,Incredible they made such a bad movie!,"Let me see if I get this movie.Silvia (Nicole Kidman) overhears by mistake a plot for killing the dictador, so she put herself on risk telling the Secret Service who doesn't believe her at the first place.Now, she has a guy who is trying her for telling the SS, but finaly she decides she better kill the dictador all by herself.Why didn't she just hears the conversation and not telling anyone about it, so someone else would have kill the dictador?STUPID MOVIE, DON""T LOSE YOUR TIME!"
2,Excellent Example of Kidman's Poor Acting Chops,"The over rated Kidman could not nail a proper accent so her accent is from a non-existent country, which is what directors have to do when they have hired a marginally talented performer. Sadly Kidman has very little to show us that has not been seen over and over again as Hollywood keeps selling her as a talented actor. If one focuses on Sean Penn trying to keep a straight face by pretending he actually cares about her character and if one buys into the ludicrous plot, one can be entertained by this movie while drunk."
3,Somewhere in the middle.,"The Interpreter, directed by Sydney Pollack is a good movie with better acting (albeit a mumbled jumbled accent by Nicole Kidman who plays Silvia) and an excellent storyline.Yes Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn are unbelievably good actors, but her accent was pathetic. She had lived in Africa and in America so I guess it should have been mixed, but this was strange.As a suspense thriller, it's excellent although for me, it could have been about a half hour shorter."
1,Buyers beware! Badly bootlegged software!,"Since the 321 studios was court ordered to stop production of this product many bootlegged copies of this software have found their way onto the market. I had purchased their original x press version in 2001 and it worked excellent. I later moved and then my hard drive fried and lost all my software programs without the install disks. I recently purchased the x copy platinum from someone liquidating their 'in stock' merchandise as this product is no longer in manufacture. It down loaded perfect and came on screen just like the original... then after I clicked on 'start' a little window popped up saying this movie is CSS encrypted, and would NOT copy! The window had a link to learn more about CSS encryption which took me to 321 Studios window saying their software (specifically platinum 4.0.3 version) had been badly copied and my version had 'cracks' which would not work and could damage my computer."
1,where's monique???,hold up!!no hezekiah walker cd is complete if monique isn't present. where is she? ... why did she just all of the sudden disappear??i really didn't like this album. there was no annointing in it.
5,"Pastors, Ministers of Music, Chrisitans Everywhere...Get it!","This CD is a blessing. I read the other reviews and I too share their sentiments on this CD. But to add to all the reviews, the song, ""I Need You To Survive""...Pastors, Minister's of Music, Christians Everywhere...Get it! You need to at least hear the message in this song. It's truly time for us to come together, breaking divisional walls and partitions because we do need each other to survive. The Ministry of this song will bless your church Ministers of Music. It's timely...Blessings to you all!"
2,Did Not Meet Expecations.,"I used the product for 2 weeks straight in 30 minute increments each night before bed. And I do not notice any difference in my smile. My teeth were already white -as far as normal teeth coloring goes (which isnt white enough in today's world), and I was still hoping to make them whiter - the way it looks when you get your teeth bleached. I wish I had ordered just one tube to try it out instead of ordering the bulk amount in excitement after reading other positive reviews. I do wonder if they work better on yellow/slightly stained teeth but are not meant for bleaching. I am disappointed having no results after 2 weeks, but maybe I had the wrong expectations."
3,its alright,"it does whiten my teeth very well with the professional dental trays i have however,it doesnt seem like its 35%"
5,Dental Whitening,"Much more effective than the 22%, and the price was worth the added efficacy. Delivery was on time, & there were no hassles with the transaction."
4,"Great drill, wrong picture","I got the drill and knocked out a wiring project in no time with it. The drill feels very solid and works very smoothly.The one complaint I have is that the case is plastic, not the one in the picture. It's a good case, but when buying on the internet, you have to trust the pictures and descriptions. The case is an above average plastic case, so it's not a huge deal.I only take off one star because of the inaccurate picture. The drill is five star."
3,Not remastered!,"How Carcass and Earache could pass up the opportunity to actually remaster this groundbreaking album boggles the mind. Iggy managed to do it with Raw Power, so these yobs have no excuse. Yes this is a great album, but its masterpiece-like qualities could have been cemented by a good remastering. Even the band were deeply unhappy with the original mix (this fact has been stated repeatedly in the music press), and this reissue, despite Amazon's claim of ""Original Recording Remastered"" still sounds like it was mixed with teacups over the engineer's ears. Why does this re-release exist? Probably to capitalize on the band's recent reunion tour and to milk hardcore fans (like myself) with the promise of a better-sounding version of this classic album. Also included is an early demo and a DVD documentary which may sweeten the pot for some."
1,now...,"i love grind and all... but the production just kills the experience. this is the first carcass cd i've gotten and i plan on getting more, granted they actually have decent production. i guess the music is good... hell i dunno. the production is just so [bad] you can't really make heads or tails of any of these songs. the best thing about this cd is the lyrics and atmosphere of the band. they use quite a lot of big words, and are very proficient at explicity describing gruesome deaths and mutilations.but... it just sounds bad. i can't stand hearing a good cd ruined by horrible production. if you like this album, please im me or something so i can figure out what exactly is it about your psyche that allows you to like this."
3,Great songs + horrible production = a tough call,"While the songs on Carcass' first release are an often brilliant mixture of caffeine-addled grind and death-metal, it's usually difficult to tell because of the horrible, microphone-in-a-trashcan production. I would recommend the far superior and better-produced ""Symphonies of Sickness"" to new Carcass initiates. I have the original CD release of ""Symphonies"" that contains ""Reek"" (Along with the autopsy-collage album cover) and the difference in production between the two is like night and day. A.C. have used a similar-sounding production style on a few of their releases, akin to being stuck under three feet of sludge while the band plays above you. In A.C.'s case it just seems to be a parody. It's a tragedy for Carcass fans that this material was produced so poorly. I'd welcome a remaster with open arms, in this case it just might be a lost cause."
5,classic album by the masters of gore grind,"Ok, a lot of Carcass fans hate this album, well, they don't hate it, but they dont exactly love it either. i'm a carcass fan who LOVES this album. in fact, its in my cd player right now(along with devoid of faith and cannibal corpse). this album, although really shoddily recorded, features the amazing vocal talents of Jeff Walker (who screaches like a quadraplegic teenager being attacked by wild ferrets) and the guttural growl of Bill Steer, who is, in my opinion, the BEST guitarist ever. top this all off with a musical barrage of fast drumming, distorted guitar/bass and the sickest lyrics cannibal corpse never wrote (have a thesaurus at hand, friends) and you have an instant classic for this reviewer. great album. i cant say enough about it, so just go get it. all their other stuff is fantastic too, i mean, come on people, this is Carcass!"
3,works good,this works if unless you dont know your cat is not fixed and spraying.if they arent fixed and spraying this wont help ya.
1,Reads like a lousy textbook,"This book is so boring that I fell asleep several times while reading it. The author dumped too many incidents, dates and personalities into each chapter. Is there really a need to go to such a level of details? The reader can easily get overwhelmed and lose sight of the big picture. In intelligence jargon, there is too much ""noise"". The contents also appear disorganised and disjointed. Much can be done to make this piece of work more readable."
5,Worthy of Vince Flynn,"With ""Flashpoint,"" S. Brockmann has moved out of the realm of romance writing and has entered into the mostly-male action genre. This book is superb -- worthy of Vince Flynn, and, dare I say it? even the great T. Clancy. There really is no better way to describe Suzanne's writing style here other than to say ""she writes like a guy."" This book is more plot-based than her other novels, and the action and dialogue keeps the reader in suspense all the way. I love the departure from Team 16 (that's just me though, I love the world of spydom more than the world of commandos). This book is so good that I think even my husband would enjoy it. The romance is secondary to the operation, which makes the book better, I believe."
5,Awesome Dale Earnhardt Jr. Leather Hat !!,"A great and high quality dale earnhardt jr. # 8 Leather racing cap for all dale jr. Fans and collector's !! Very Pristine and classy ! Dale jr. Has now signed with hendricks motorsports with jimmie johnson and jeff gordon and he will have a new sponsor and a new number , so hurry and buy this hat for your collection !!"
3,Nice tool,"This tool is very nice. It makes it easy to get a super flat finish.But be careful. The clip that holds the frame to the sander is not, in my opinion at least, strong enough. The sander can work itself free if you don't handle it carefully.The frame has two inserts. A hard plastic insert for when you want to get the board perfectly flat. And a brush insert for more delicate work. Both are nice but there are thirteen (!) screws holding the inserts in place. Changing inserts is a hassle.Also, it seems awfully expensive. On the other hand, if it prevents you from ruining one or two glued-up boards, it can easily pay for itself."
5,Brillantly done by Peikoff,"For anyone who is interested in studying objectivist philosophy this is certainlly a great place to start to get the whole overview. This book gives the overall concepts of the philosophy and the book flows very well. The book basically is the meat of Objectivism the philosophy of Ayn Rand. I read this book and others before even reading Atlas Shurgged. In doing this, I could see the philosophy come alive in the characters. This is the magic of Rand in relation to other authors is how she was so principled in the application of her philosophy whether it be in her fictional novels or non fiction writing about politics and economics and the like. All in all great book and im hopeing for a hardcover copy."
3,No page numbers,Downloaded the kindle book for my pc and it has no page numbers which makes it difficult to find reference pages and exams.
4,Gullah Mailman,"This was a gift for my husband. We have been going to the St. Helena, S.C. area for about 52 years and love the area. My husband is truly enjoying this book and I look forward to reading it when he is finished. my husband says that it is well-written and evocative of the island of yesteryear."
4,Little Boys wallet?,The wallet is nice enough however I was looking for a smaller product.It was to be for a 6 year old special needs little guy who tries to put his money in his back pocket like dad and grandpa do. Too big for little boys jeans.
5,Invaluable Look at White House Life,I had great stories to share with my children every night at dinner each time I had the chance to read a chapter of this book. How lucky we are to have such a historical book about how the White House really was run from 1943-1969!
2,"Down I went, down and down, down to the bottom of the world...","...down and down... and down...down......down.Wait, who was I listening to? And was someone else listening? Was I listening to the telephone? Or was the telephone also listening?I feel it here... and here... and sometimes here... and here too... and over here...The rest of you might fall for this poetry of the streets stuff, but not me. I got an ear, see, and it's telling me to stop listening.The direction, cinematography, and acting are fine. Even the sound it good. But the dialog is just plain loopy -- and not fun loopy (like Janet Leigh's railway speech in Manchurian Candidate).This is the first time I ever wished a movie had been dubbedinto Italian.I don't speak Italian."
2,BEWARE,"This watch looks absolutely amazing,but I am very disappointed. The battery in mine died in less than a year.The way the watch is designed, you either have to have a ""certified jeweler"" replace,or, send back to Nixon & they'll replace for a ""normal fee"".When I plugged in the info on their webpage,it quoted me (possible) fee of 42 dollars,including shipping! Thats almost 25% of the cost I paid for the thing,to replace the battery!! That bites,BIG time...."
2,MOTION SENSOR ADJUSTMENT DIFFICULTY,"I have installed a pair of these lights in the front of my house by the left and right side of the garage but only one will light up when motion is detected. The other one stays unlit all the time even if motion is detected, unless I cover one side of the sensor and then it lights up. I tried to replace it with the extra pair I bought, thinking that it might be defective, but it stays the same."
1,American Con Artists,What a disappointment. The History Channel has really stooped low in airing this latest reality series. We have two 40 something guys (are they lovers) going around and ripping off granny and gran pops precious heirlooms and antiques.-It's called ripping people off when you offer pennies on the dollar for what something is actually worth.-A better show would be one where the old folks get revenge on these two turd bombers.
2,"Decent entertainment, but very unrealistic","I watch this show, mostly because the two stars are likeable, ordinary guys. The premise - that money can be found in what other people call junk - is also a popular one. But there is no WAY these guys could make a profit driving as far as they do to do their ""picking."" The best review I have seen on the subject is at practicalfrugalliving dot wordpress dot com in the September articles."
2,I used to love this show.,"These guys used to be very fair with people.As a matter of fact,sometimes they would even give the people more than they were asking for an item,because the picker guys knew it was worth more then the seller was asking for it.It's what Mike called ""picking karma"" or something.But nowadays,it seems that Mike and Frank have become quite the cheapskates.They are NO WHERE near as fair as they used to be.Just goes to show you what the love of money can do to people and how it can change them.Maybe I am the only person who has noticed this about them lately.I don't know.But I sure have noticed a change in these guys when it comes to being fair."
5,"Normally I don't give 5 star reviews, but....","...Slaid Cleaves ""Broke Down"" is such a good record! Slaid is in the vein of many a folk singer-songwriter, but this album stands out from the rest.Slaid writes and sings songs that are very descriptive; it's like a story being told in front of you.The music is very laid back and mellow with lots of acoustic guitar.Also, it's solid throughout start to finish, no duds in there. Superb stuff."
4,Very Nice but Not Perfect,"I bought this blade to saw hard maple. The blade that came with my miter saw (DeWalt 60 tooth ""Fine Finish"") was clearly inadequate to the task. I hoped that this blade would make smooth cuts with no tearout. This blade was, in fact, a significant improvement over the blade that it replaced. It makes smooth cuts with effectively no bottom tearout. Back tearout was diminished but remained somewhat of a problem. Overall, this blade has proved adequate to the task. It is arguably worth what what you pay for it. However, if the perfect blade exists, it isn't this one."
1,Lee Hazlewood,"The CD is in fine condition, but came without liner notes. The disc was delivered sans jewel case, with no liner notes, just the under CD liner with the song titles. There was no indication in the product details that the disc would come without a full package. I am dissatisfied, and will make it a point not to use this retailer again."
2,Somewhat Dissapointing at 20',"This feature only lasts twentyone minutes, which is lousy for $19,50 (and, in my case, $18,50 for shipping and handling). The feature itself is mostly an interview. Very few scenes can be seen The feature was originally on videotape, at least, that's what the quality looks like.All in all, this is a major rip-off. Of course, there is hardly any footage of Russell available, so the little that is there has to be bought dearly. Still, this is too little DVD for too much money."
3,good for fans...,"I can't say I've heard a lot of NWW, but this disc fit my expectations a little too well. I imagine that there are a number of far better introductions to this band. I still listen to it as I sleep very often, but I'm definitely looking forward to finding the recording with 'I Am the Poison' on it."
4,Solid and good looking,"Decent enough corkscrew. Doesn't hold the bottle, so it takes a few cracks to get it right but once you do cork is like butter. Sexy looking piece for the bar too."
5,best Corkscrew I have ever bought,"I have bought cheap corkscrews, expensive corkscrews, the ones that you place in a holder and they charge up but this is the best corkscrew I have owned. Love the design of it first and foremost. You sit the U on each side of the bottle and twist. Yes I would love a better way to get the corkscrew off once you have opened the wine but with the ease and smoothness of opening the bottle I will be more than happy to take more time to get the cork off. My husband was even surprised at how easy and smooth this works."
2,Schutz as He Never Intended,"From a strictly vocal perspective, this recording is perfectly fine. I bought it with the sumptuous sonorities of Venice in mind, however, which is what Schutz had in mind when he wrote the Psalmen Davids. What Summerly delivers is a minimalist version where the instrumental accompaniment is limited to a continuo organ which cannot possibly supply the added dimensions Schutz intended to incorporate through the use of instrumental parts. For those who want to hear the legacy of Schutz' experience in Venice with Gabrieli in these wonderful works, they would do well to look to another recording, perhaps the version done by Musica Fiata."
3,One of the best Schutz anthologies on disc.,"Apart from being well performed this is also a well thought out selection. Half the tracks on this CD, 6 out of 12, are taken from Schutz' 1619 Opus ""Psalms of David"", large-scale polychoral settings following his teacher Gabrieli's model. They are performed sensitively here and counterposed with lighter works (such as the soprano duet ""Erhore mich wenn ich rufe"" and the bass solo ""Ich liege und schlafe"", both taken from the Kleine Geistliche Konzerte II of 1639). The program concludes with Schutz' graveside memorial motet to his friend Schein framed with a couple of Schein's pavans on either side, and then the final Magnificat from his own swansong opus. 64'08"" playing time, full texts and translations. And all this at a sub-budget price."
4,Great book,"This is a great book, my daughter loves Elmo and could easily relate to the short story. I purchased this book because she is now 2 and we plan to transition her to a big bed soon. I think this book will help and she enjoys the story. Book allows for a lot of room to add to the story to explain to your child what they are going to feel and that it is OK."
5,great book for a trasitioning toddler,"We are transitioning our 2 yr old from his crib to a ""big boy"" bed. He loves books and Elmo. Great book for a child going from a crib to bed!"
5,great book,Got product on time and book was great. Kids love elmo and so its a great role model to have in a book to help them get into bed.
5,Helped a lot!,"We read this book with my daughter before, during and afte her transition to a ""big girl bed."" She loved it! She now likes to ""read"" it herself and knows what each of the pages says. I highly recommend this book to parents of toddlers."
2,Covenant is not Contract,"While addressing some points well, the argument starts off on the wrong foot in the first chapter, where he equates the marriage covenant to a contract. This takes marriage down to a business arrangement, not the covenantal relationship that models Christ's relationship to the church. Do you think Christ only has a business arrangement with the church?"
1,Poor Exegesis,"The huge focus on how ancient cultures treat divorce, is completely irrelevant. What matters is what Jesus says. Case in point, Mark 10:11-12, ""Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits [present tense] against her. And if the wife divorces her husband and marries another, she is committing adultery."" Emphasis added. This coincides with Romans 7:2-3, ""A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if he is dead, she is released from the law of her husband. So then, if she marries another while her husband is still alive, she should be called and adulteress (one who practices adultery). But if her husband be dead [literally no longer living], she is free from the law of her husband and is not an adulteress if she marries another."" Emphasis added.Its a sign of how apostate so called Christians are today, when we cannot accept the simplest, clear, and emphatic teaching of our Lord and Saviour. If you don't take Him at His Word, why do you call yourself a Christian?"
4,A fair weather camera - no easy button,"When everything is great, out of doors, lots of light and color, this camera can't be beat. Move to poor lighting or tough conditions and it becomes impossible to manage. Other reviewers have declared it to be a ""fine arts"" camera and definitely not an ""event"" camera. They are right. In RAW mode, it takes forever to load. JPEG mode is a disappointment and forget anything over ISO=200. The software that comes with it is buggy. Fortunately Photoshop Elements will do the downloads with no effort. The images I am getting are outstanding, provided I do everything just right. The color is a bit over saturated, but for me that is good. Battery life has been terrible, no more than 50 shots per charge. Still, for me, the outstanding image quality is worth the trouble. I am hanging onto my other camera though."
2,too high rise!,"This jean I expected a different color and as it says on the ad, it's not low rise at all."
4,fleeting fun,"this is a sturdy, fast, cute car. it looks just like mater, and i think i could drop it off my building & it would keep going.that said, like most r/c cars, it was gleefully played with about 3 times and has collected dust since. if your kid is more into r/c cars than mine, this is a good one."
3,"Beware, wrong translation!","The Everyman's Library edition of Anna Karenina is the Maude translation, not the Pevear-Volokhonsky translation praised by so many readers. That translation is available in a Penguin paperback and an out-of-print Viking hardcover edition. Amazon erred in displaying the readers' reviews of the Pevear-Volokhonsky translation under the description of the Everyman's Library book."
5,"beautiful book, great condition","this book takes the reader back to days gone by.. beautifully written --not finished with the book as yet it is 900+pages.. read the preface last, it rather gives away the storyline.."
4,Pretty good,"I read this book for school, it was on a book list. I wasn't sure that I would like it, but it turned out good. I heard that Tulsa Ballet made a ballet out of it, (I'm a dancer) and I think that's great! Its like a Russian soap opera. :-)"
1,Be wary ...,we ordered this on the 18th and have just been told that it will not arrive until well after christmas. delivery information is misleading and their customer service is essentially nonexistant (and uncaring) so there's no way we can modify our order.do you want to give a company like that your business?
3,Just OK,"I think that calling the main compartment 'enormous' is quite a misprint. I'm taking a class this semester that requires 4 books just for that class alone, so combined with all my other classes, something tells me I will be carrying some of my other books. Other than that, it looks like it's going to hold all the rest of my stuff...i.e. utensils, water bottle, etc. Nice-looking, too."
4,Ight',"song 1- alright, kinda scary spooky sounding not the best song 6/10song 2-your dadpredicatble rulesso does i just wanna livethats all thats good"
1,Good for a few reasons.,"1. Booklet can be recycled...the environment is good2. CD can be used as a frisbee, or a coaster. You don't want to get ring marks on your coffee table3. You can use the jewel case to carry any other random cd's you have lying about.4. Good Charllote hates the environment"
1,its all downhill from here,"oh my gosh. when i heard gc had another cd coming out i freaked since i am a fan, but now today, since Amazon put up the recordings, im looking at the cd Cronicles with disgust. What happened to my Gc? The happy, funny, strange, gc? Now they are trying to be all sad and depressed and it's not going to cut it. I'm never gunna buy that CD ever. its crap. Sorry u guys, but if you would have stuck to the moods of your first CD and Young and Hopeless you would be doing a lot better.thats it, im going to buy Taking Back Sundays CD!! Now THEY rock!!"
3,Not nearly as catchy as the last album...,"Like most of America, my first exposure to Good Charlotte was from their cracking first single, ""Lifestyles of The Rich & The Famous."" It was love at first listen, with that thumping bass drum and endless energy.Single after single followed, all equally but maddeningly catchy. You simply couldn't get them out of your head! ""The Anthem"", ""Girls & Boys"", ""Riot Girl""...Very few up-and-coming groups demonstrate that sort of consistency, right out of the box. These were songs that were fun to listen to.Their new album, immaculately produced, doesn't have any songs NEARLY as impressive as any of those I mentioned. The choruses aren't there; the lyrics more somber and serious (not a bad thing) and the melodies are weak (most definitely a bad thing).Being a new fan, and someone who enjoys this type of music (The Clash to Yellowcard), I have to say I was a little disappointed."
4,Lap Dancer,"Aptly known as Friction on video, this movie was great introducing Elizabeth Wagner in nudity and in an errotic light porno. It also displays Amir Aboulela of Barb Wire who did a great job playing Rick. Although the movie did not get a big hit as drama, it did its purpose of nudity and life of strip club getting quick cash. I liked it. It would be a five star movie for me if it emphasizes more intense scenes of strip dancing. Unlike other nudity movies, atleast the cover is real."
2,Lap bad,Not what was expected...Content was not what was written on box.Funny part is I had seen the movie before and just didnt realize it.lol
5,LOVE IT,"I don't know much about this iPod stuff - I bought it so that my daughter could use it in the car. Before this, we bought another model (can't remember which one) and it did not work at all. I was worried we would have similar problems with this one, but it works just fine. No static at all, very clear reception and it's easy to use. It comes with a bunch of different mounting adapters so it is sure to fit just about anything. I would definetly suggest this thing!"
4,Bueno pero...,"Me pareció un buen producto; buen diseño y funcional. Muy fácil de instalar y de usar. Se ve bien dentro del auto y el brazo conector a la toma de 12V se adapta a varias posiciones. Lo que me decepciono fue la calidad del sonido: poca potencia y no es estéreo. Definitivamente dista de la calidad de sonido de un CD. No espere mucho en cuanto a sonido se refiere, pero es aceptable."
5,Those other reviews are ridiculous,"i got a 4th g ipod and transpod for christmas '04.the next day i drove from tampa,fl to louisville,ky with no whinning noise or interference.no problems what so ever.i also am driving my work truck 4-6 hrs a day with this sweet baby plaugged in,still no issues.yes,some songs are low in volume,but if you know how to adjust your settings in itunes,you can adjust any volume issues before hand.maybe those other people where useing crappy songs that they stole from kazaa or something.all my songs are straight from itunes or from cd.i'm not a theif."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"It's nice to have a charger and player all in one, but the sound quality of the transmission is about that of an old, scratched LP (and as instructed, I tried every station between 88 and 107). The manual says once you have the station tuned in on the car stereo and Transpod all you should hear is ""silence;"" the best I got it down to was high pitched interference."
2,Its ok...,"When I first got this item (from Best Buy for $99), I enjoyed it a lot. But now the little problems have gotten more annoying.For example, I drive a stick shift and I am constantly hitting the thing since the input is nearby. My front passengers always tend to hit it too.After seeing what my friend bought for his car ipod use,I am hating my transpod more and more. He has the Monster Ipod hookup, the one where you just plug it into the Ipod like you would a cell phone. No interference with a manual shift car or passengers, you can set it anywhere in the vehicle, not bulky). The Transpod has a large bulky arm that can be adjusted but not too much adjustment is possible. It also comes loose very often.I just think it is very inconvenient depending what type of vehicle you have."
4,Lots of fun - a bit of a learning curve.,"Carnival Games is a such a great idea for a Wii Game. They honestly nailed the theme and it took me back to my younger days playing carnival games to win stuffed Ninja Turtle toys. My favorite 2 games are the ""Shoot out the red star"" game, and ski-ball. I've never been able to shoot out the red star in real life so this is great practice. Ski-ball is just a great responsive game.Some gripes: Some games take awhile to learn (mini-golf), and some have kind of wonky controls (basketball)."
3,Carnival Games,"This game is fun, but not as fun as Wii Sports, or Mario Galaxy. Up to 4 players can play at a time is which is good. Games are a little simple, not as challanging as Wii Sports."
4,Short and Sweet,This game is quite fun and quick/easy to play. It has about 25 mini games with items that you can unlock. It is easy to pick up yet has enough difficulty that getting the high scores on every level takes some time.
1,Waste of money,"This particular game should not be compatible to play on a Wii console. Unlike Nintendo Wii products, the avitars are not diversified to reflect individuals of all races and colors, which I find very insulting and offensive. I taught my children and grandchildren diversity awareness.After playing the games and finding out that during certain intervvals, the games freeze. The vocals on the games are depicting of negative attitudes, which I refuse to allow my grandchildren to play with it.Take my advice and don't bother buying this game. I plan on sticking to Nintendo Wii games, even though I found the purchase of Dance Dance Revolution to be entertaining, as well as diversified."
3,Not as fun as looks!,Not very happy with this game. the graphics are sad looking and not very user friendly for kids. Won't buy it again.
4,A Very Entertaining Game,"My wife is a elementary school teacher and this game was recommended by some of her students. We bought the WII for my wife's mother who is 80 years old. She loves playing this game with her granddaughter. The game has various levels or ""areas"" of a carnival. Duck Shoot, Dunk Tank, Fortune Teller are just a few. I would recommend this game to anyone. Item arrived sooner than expected."
4,fun game for all,This game has alot of options to play and not hard to figure out. The only thing is that your Mii doesn't carry into the game. Plenty of fun for all ages.
4,Carnival Games,"Its a fun game for the whole family. My daughter that is 5 can play it and my son that is 12 can play it and have fun. It's also fun for the whole family. A good game when you have friends over for game night. Amazed by all the games. Just when you thought you forgot a carnival game, this game has it covered. Good work. Good price."
5,great buy,I bought this as a gift for my daughter but the whole family (ages 3-30) love it. Even my parents in their 50's had a great time when they played while visiting.
2,Unnatural,"I purchased this game specifically to play ""Ally Ball"" or as we call it Skee Ball. Using the Wii remote, it was unrealistic & did not feel natural. I was trying to throw the ball as though I was really playing & it wouldn't work. I tried everything. Flicking my wrist, throwing it like a light bowling ball. Very diappointing. I tried a few of the other games too & they felt unnatural too. To make the game work I had to use the Wii remote in a way that was nothing like you would play the game in real life. I plan to give away or re-sell this game."
4,Fun Fun Fun!,"Like this game a lot. Yes, there may be some waiting time for the game to load up at first, but once you get going it's not too bad. Me and my friends love playing this game (especially the star shoot out one). I'm just starting to unlock some more games, and it's been a great adventure."
2,Could/should have been better,"I loved the concept of this game - to string together the wide variety of mini games you find at an old-style carnival. Sadly, this game falters in the execution. Some games are very intuitive while others require clumsy combinations of aiming, locking and less than natural movements.Also, none of the 'charm' of Nintendo's Wii executions are present here - no use of Miis; easy and natural customization of characters; smooth, intuitive flows of motion to make the games work - there's none of that here.Too bad - a great idea only marginally well executed. Suggest you rent first."
4,Pretty fun game,"I bought this so my 5 year old grandson could have a game to play with me. He really loves the games,and plays it everytime he visits. I found the characters to be weird looking,and sometimes it's slow between turns..but he really loves earning tickets and getting prizes. The Skee-Ball is quite realistic..it's like your really rolling the balls up the ramp,the dunk dank is fun,and many games are fun...and you unlock new games as you get better at certain games. I am glad we can play together,and it's a nice change from Wii sports{although we love that as well}"
4,Great fun and great value!,"Carnival games uses the Wii remote effectively and in a great variety of ways. The number of games you can play is really satisfying, and it's a lot of fun playing with others."
4,fun for all of the family,"the whole family will find something they like at the carnival, i like the duck shoot(mom),my daughter 17 likes ring toss,and dad likes it all,hours of skill and fun for all."
4,Love this game!,"I bought this game last week and love it. Despite mixed web reviews, I went ahead and bought this game and feel it is totally worth $[...]. There are tons of great carnival games to play, some harder than others. The graphics are tight and have a kind of old scratchy look which fits the old feel. I've only played the games with adults but I think kids over 8 would be able to play most of the games. There are a few that may be too hard for them (but they're hard for me!)Overall- buy this game!"
4,Like being there but in the end cheaper!,This is a great game if you have a group and have four controllers. We enjoyed the game play and the environment.
1,How could people rate this 5 stars? How even 3?,"Controls are iffy, and in some cases bad. Silly/useless ""prizes"". Can't use Mii (have to make a new character, just so you can win prizes to outfit them). Wildly variable toughness in the games - many are simply pure luck (ok, that's not too out of character, but usually there's at least the *illusion* of skill mattering in a carnival) or simply don't work well. Poor graphics.I may never bother trying all the games after trying out 10 or so. Worst: the football toss. Best: perhaps the horse race; at least the controls seem to mostly work there. But ""best"" is not strong praise here."
5,Great For The Whole Family!!!!!!!,"I originally bought this game because the children wanted it. I am not one to play video games, I leave that to my husband and children. But then I watched them play Carnival Games, and I had to have them reset the system so I could also be included in playing. All of the games were so much fun, we have such a great time whenever we play it together. All of the games that you would find at Carnivals & Fairs are on here; plus more. Pretty much the only difference is that on this, you will actually have a better winning streak because they are not ""rigged"" like some are at an actual carnival making it harder for people to win."
4,Loads of fun,My family and I loved this game. It is a lot of fun and brings back the memories of the fair. It is more fun played as a family than one person alone. It is a great way to spend quality time together and play games that you enjoy at the fairs. Good luck and have fun with this game.
2,THIS WAS NOT A CARNIVAL,"Carnival GamesTHIS GAME WAS NOT A CARNIVAL TO PLAY. WHEN I TRIED TO PLAY THIS GAME I COOULDN'T USE MYREMOTE. A PICTURE APPEARED SHOWING A REMOTE FLIPPING BACK AND FORTH, SO MEAN WHILEI HAVE LOST ALL CONTROL OF MY REMOTE. NOW EVERYBODY ELSE CAN USE THEIR REMOTE,EXCEPT MYREMOTE IS THE ONLY ONE IDLE, AND THIS HAPPENS EVERY SINGLE TIME I PLAY THIS GAME.I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I JUST STOPPED PLAYING CARNIVAL GAMES ALL TOGETHER.THIS GAME WAS A WASTE OF MONEY!FRUSTRATED"
3,Don't believe the hype !,"It's an ok game for the price, but don't get too excited...its an ok game. NOthing too great. In other words, it's aight @!"
3,Fun for kids,"This game is for kids and by kids I mean between 3-7. The games are small and get over in the same time, it takes to load the game. But probably it gives the best carnival atmosphere as the same thing happens at real carnivals.The graphics are passable."
1,Surprised to see so many good reviews...,"Seems like a lot of people really like this game, but I don't care for it.Takes a long time to master controls, but no real pay off once you do, becuase the games are not that interesting.Weak character designSlow to start and change gamesI DO like other short, mini-game style games on the Wii, including Rayman Rabbids (1 and 2), Wario Ware, and even Wii Play.Since there seems to be a real split in reviews, I suggest people to rent/borrow/buy used to avoid a let down."
2,"Amusing, But Lacking","I saw the five-star reviews here, and so I decided to give Carnival Games a try.Boy was I disappointed. There are quite a few mini-games, but only a select few are fun to play - the rest are frustrating. Most of them are very finicky, and the animation is quite sub-par. Unlike Wii Play Games, Carnival Games lack replayability.Do yourself a favor - rent it first."
3,Thought it would be better,I mainly bought this for the kids. Some of the games need a bit more fine motor control that only an older child or adult would have. I play it more than my kids. It will probably been fun for a while but I think it will find its way to a 'trade in' store somewhere. I thought it would be better.
4,Good 4 person multi-player game,"We wanted to be able to have 4 people playing at once and also wanted fairly quick and simple games that we could play with a group of people (so people could take turns and not have to wait too long). Something with a fast learning curve. That's what this is. The unpopular games in the set are the games that aren't skill based (tossing balls into milk jugs) and the ones where you have to shake the remote vigorously (strong man) but the shooting ones, tossing ones, etc... have been a big hit. With about 40 games to choose from, there is likely to be something everyone will like. The duck shooting is my favorite. Mostly, we just enjoy being able to have 4 people playing and the fact that everyone can jump right in and figure it out."
2,Weak,"Another selection of Ho-Hum mini games. These should be called micro-mini games as your turn is over with so fast, then it's a stop down. To me, this is Wii's biggest downfall. Too many mini games with way too much stop down. While there are over 25 games in here, you spend 2/3 of your time just moving between menu's and game loading and only 1/3 playing. The games are almost all pure dumb luck too, which I guess is pretty much how all carnival games are, but just not as much fun throwing virtual coins at plates and virtual rings at bottles, etc. Great idea for a fun interactive game, just poorly executed."
2,poor use of time,If trying to learn useful information about cocaine and addiction this book is not a good use of time. I'd recoomend another title as most of this book spends its pages in benign information and ends with observations more political and social than informative.
5,Compelling story about Female Circumcision,This story needed to be told. This is a wonderful story about loyalty and friendship. This books succeeds both as a stand-alone piece of exceptional writing and as a clarion call to raise awareness about this horrific practice.
4,Keith Sweat is the greatest,This DVD brought back so many good memories from the 80's. I am glad that he brought in a little hip hop to bring it up to date. I have always loved to listen to his music and would be intrested in another DVD live preformance
5,A long-lost gem from the '80s,"It's pretty amazing to finally get Roman Holliday's debut album on CD. The original cassette kept me entertained for years until the thing wore out. Roman Holliday's music -- brassy, joyous and energetic -- helped provide the soundtrack for my high school years. Highlighted by the warm voice of charismatic lead singer Steve Lambert, the group created a killer debut, fueled by the singles ""Don't Try To Stop It"" and ""Stand By."" But the rest of the disc is remarkably consistent, including the pseudo ballad ""Serious Situation"" and the delightful ""Midnight Bus."" This stuff predated the swing revival by years, but is more energetic and original than almost anything to come out of that scene.Roman Holliday completely changed their sound (no more swing) and image (no more sailor hats) for their second and final album, ""Fire Me Up."" Still, it's a fine disc -- hopefully that will be coming out on CD some time soon."
3,It was the color of milky tea!,"When I ordered this I expected to get and African American woodkin. This was so pale, it might as well have been white. Nothing like the one in the picture, which I had previously owned and was replacing. Very disappointed."
1,Worst bookcase I've ever bought,"This bookcaase required what appeared to be simple construction. I was able to put together the main part in about 15 minutes. Getting the top on, however, took almost TWO HOURS! The holes for the screws were not of appropriate size, and were intended, like the sides, to allow for deeper gripping. Unlike the sides, though, the pieces to the top were much much deeper, and so, after trying every possible scenario to get them in, the screws had to be pounded into the wood. I had to set up the bookcase upside down on thick layers of cardboard to pound the screws in sufficiently. I used a very short philips screwdriver and a hammer to pound them in. The tool that came with the bookcase was so very insufficient. All told, I finally had to get someone as getting the top shelf on the bookcase was a two-person job. When I finally got it put together, the whole thing wobbled. I'm so disappointed!"
1,Avoid at all costs,"This product has some major quality control issues.We were unsure about ordering this product because of the people having issues with cracks in pieces. We started off only ordering one unit because of this and it ended up fine. Due to this, we ordered two more... huge mistake. The first shelf got a major crack on the top shelf. It's so big, it runs across half the piece. If you look closely, you can tell that the wood was weak to begin with.The second shelf was even worse. 3 of the pieces had cracks to begin with that were painted over with the finish.Unless you want to waste your money, do not order this product."
5,Sturdy and looks good,I hung up a nice 50 inch tv and needed something underneath to hold the cable box and help cover the wire/cable organizer. This unit arrived quickly and I put it together with ease.It's darker than the pic and just what I needed.I'd recommend this and it looks nice
5,Great product,"It was difficult spending the cost of this item. Yet, it works great. If you see this anywhere other than online, you probably are not getting the best price."
1,Rent Something Good Like Dukes of Hazard Instead...,"I can sum this movie up using 20 words or less. Way too predictable of a story line with potential to be funny but instead falls flat on its face. See, 19 words, however, I didn't completely pan this flick with just one star but instead decided to bump it up to two stars due to the fact that Julie Bowen is smoking hot and provided just enough eye candy to keep me from ripping the DVD right out from the machine and blowing it up with an M80. My advice, take the $4.00 rental fee you would have paid to see this movie and just send it right to me as an advance thank you for saving you the time and frustration of having to sit through this train wreck, or you may want to send me the $50.00 replacement fee you would have been charged from taking out your twelve gage to use this piece of garbage as skeet shooting practice."
2,Don't Waste the Money!!!,"The only thing Louie Devito has going for him is the fact that he is good looking. Other than that, he is a failure as a channeler of electronic energy (DJ). This CD, as all other CDs in this series, is extremely commercial, overly mixed (same beat drawn out too long) and quite repetitive. There is nothing underground about it!!! If you want compilations of the same old songs that are played out, the ones you keep hearing everywhere you go, yes, fellow partier, those same songs you already own, probably several times over, on all your other CDs, then be my guest. Personally, I'd recomend something like Gatecrasher's Immerse Yourself, which is a 2 CD compilation of less commercial yet still somewhat popular songs. If you do want a CD of popular trance and techno songs, get Trance Party instead, it is a much better mix. If you have good house/progressive suggestions for me, something not repetitive or commercial, not empty or boring (...) Enjoy!"
3,Decent for the price,"I've gotten some decent shots with these attached to the front of my S3IS. Be warned, the Depth of Field (especially at higher zooms) is extremely small so in that sense, this accessory can be a recalcitrant asset (unforgiving taskmaster even).That said - I've gotten at least a few brilliant shots with it. Magnification is breathtaking!Distortion at maximal zoom is horrible however.For the price it's worth experimenting - especially if you don't have a d-slr or fund$$ for a proper macro len$"
5,Great!,"Intriguing subject matter, characters you care about, didn't want it to end. Simple as that. Can't wait for the sequel."
4,Good book!,"I really liked this book. It kept you through the whole story. I am usually good at figuring out who done it,but it took me a little longer."
4,Play Dead,"This was a fascinating easy Book to read and it held my attention, a great read, and a page turner!"
4,Unique and a bit creepy!!,"This book was really original, interesting, and definitely not boring!! I read lots of murder mysteries, but this one had a few twists and turns in it that one would not expect. Don't let the cover fool you--this is not a horror novel, really. It does contain some creepy elements, but by in large is a suspense/thriller novel.I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes this type of book."
4,mysterious southern vodoo thriller,"I really enjoyed this book, its a real treat for a freebie! the novel is fast paced with lots of twists and turns, keeps you guessing. i really got attached to the characters as the reader gets to know them in greater detail. i read this novel over a couple days on vacation."
4,Good book,"I almost quit reading when they mention the ""zombie"" word. Not a zombie book at all. A good book with a great story line. The characters do come to life, as well as the scenery and locations. A good read."
3,Great book for the price,"This was one of the ""free Kindle"" books offered and well sounded kinda interesting. It was interesting, I liked the story line, and the twist at the end was interesting. The writing was well done there were just a few places I felt I wanted the story to go deeper give more information, so it was an ok book overall, great book for the price :)"
3,"It's OK, But look out for tech support",I have errors during windows XP startup that won't go away with reloading the software. Tried to report it to xyxel and their report page requires the s/n. It is not printed on the outside of the pci card. Can't get past that. Should be printed on the outside if it is sooo necesary to report a problem.
2,Good filter but why non-standard size?,"I have started using these filters instead of the more expensive Mobile 1 filters, but ran into trouble trying to get them off. They are a non-standard size and neither of my life-long trusted oil wrenches nor any of my standard sleeves, which attach to a socket wrench, would fit them. Why the different sizes from all other filters? This is a pain in the neck. I went back to the auto parts store and none of their sleeves fit the filter. It doesn't exist. Why did you do this, Wix? I had to find and buy a larger oil wrench which eventually did the job, but had to pay extra. Not a very good engineering decision in my opinion."
5,Best One So Far,"I have tried every form of foil cutter on the market and the Vino Cutter is the simplest and nicest I have used. The clean cut it makes with little to no use of pressure is great. The button pushes in easy and you do not even realize you are cutting until the small foil disc pops out. This little device has some weight to it as well, which makes cutting with it easier. I highly recommend this cutter."
4,MUCH better than expected,"I've always liked The Lady in Red...very beautiful, erotic, romantic song. MOST of the songs on this CD are very nice. He writes his music. He also wrote a tribute song on Princess Diana about a new star in heaven...a bit schmaltzy but enjoyable. (I guess Elton John got the airplay with his song!)he's got a good voice...enjoyable album. I guess he is not a one hit wonder! You'll enjoy the music."
2,Worst of...,"Chris was a very mediocre singer/songwriter, and this is a compilation of his best selling/ artistically worst songs. At best indifferent, at worst intolerable."
1,Chris Deburgh Sold Out Lady Diana....,"When Lady Diana died, Chris DeBurgh announced he would write a tribute song to her and only cut 100 copies to be distributed to his personal friends. He was adamant that the song was to remain private and that selling the song would be disrespectful to Lady Diana and her memory.But guess what, now Chris is selling the song as part of this album and not caring about Lady Diana at all. It's amazing what this guy will do for money.Knowing this ruins his music for me. When I hear the voice I once liked so well, I hear a liar. He is a phoney and a money-grubber...not an artist, but a cheap salesman..."
2,What the heck!,"In the first 10 seconds of use the dust bag elbow broke off. I called the customer service number and they told me I could take it to the service center to get it fixed ""If it were still under warninty"". She was less then friendly and less then helpfull. Save yourself the hassle and don't buy this item!"
1,Wait for the next Hammer box set...,"This VHS is cheap for a good reason. It's worthless. Obviously we must beware of some Amazon ""friends"" who offer ""new"" merchandise and own shrink-wrap appliances."
2,"The Monster from Hell, looks like hell!",This movie can only be appreciated by those whom have a deep regard for Hammer films. The movie is predictable in its development and can get slow in some spots. The monster's makeup looks like something out of the Halloween clearance rack at pic n save! This is the film all future film makers should watch and learn from.
3,"Beautiful, but broken.","As the picture showed, these were beautiful coasters (5 stars). Due to improper packaging, they arrived broken(2 stars). I will reorder them again, maybe two packs, enough for my whole house. They were pretty enough to be worth the hassle.I'll add to my review when I get the next batch. If they can arrive in one piece, they deserve 5 stars."
2,Busy buzzy,"I don't usually write negitative reviews, but I really don't like this sander too much. It does the job okay, but it vibrates too much and is too noisy.It also doesn't feel good in my hand. The Porter Cable #330 speed bloc is such a nice sander that I don't understand why anyone would want any thing else. (I'm not just loyal to Porter Cable, I like a lot of things that Makita makes)Also, I didn't find the dust collecton feature worth using. It gets some of the dust, but I didn't feel like it was worth taking the time to poke holes in the sandpaper with the little tool (provided) for no more good than it did. I'm only saying this because I know that Makita can make more refined tools. Thank you"
4,Good Intro to Catie Curtis,"This was a good album, but I didn't think it was as deep as some of her other work."
3,Weak justification,"RC is a fantastic preacher but this book left me hanging. It is more of a cheerleader for the Reformed movement, and I wanted it to be an EXPLORATION and EXPLANATION of the Reformed movement. I doubt anyone who is not in agreement with Reformed Theology will find it unconvincing. I wish RC had spent more time justifying his position and explaining in layman's terms what Reformd Theology is all about."
3,Carefull,"The fronts fit perfectly and stay there. One back stays most of the time, the other has to be held back to close the window. Not impressed. Needs more double sided tape."
5,It was great!!!,"This book was excellent! I could not put this book down. I found myself not wanting to stop to go downstairs to eat. I read it in every free second that I had. I didn't want to do anyhting else. I loved this book, but it needs a sequel. He leaves you hanging in the middle of the story! It was a good book anyway but I wish that he would write a sequel."
2,Takes too long to get to Dragonholme,"This book is alright if you want a light read, but it really isn't that good. The main character is a Mary Sue that all plot conflicts splash off of with no real challenge. Everyone loves her, her Talent is stronger than most, and she manages to overturn a prison/boot camp with little effort. Most of the male characters who aren't trying to kill her seem to be immediately enraptured by the charms of her.The plot itself isn't so bad, its not fabulous, except for the fact that the secrets or location mentioned in the title doesn't show up until the last half or so. Before that its her and her brother living a charmed existence as refugees. And there is no real resolution, the book just ends, the characters go off to...do things and the book just...stops.Its a fairly simple read but really one can probably find something better to spend your time on."
5,Awesome Work!,"Peel has really out done himself on this work of Talent. I love it so much that I try to read it at least once a year! This book was and stilll is great. Melayne and her brother Sarrow on a trek of hope and endeavor. It is a great book and I would have given it wayyyy more stars if I could've. Overall, this book is a great one unlike some of Peel's other novolettes: Talons,Shattered. This was a great, enjoyable, and fast read. I loved it so much. I recommend buying this book and reading it the first chance you get!"
4,Ok,"I think I like this more than my dog! I bought it for my Doberman puppy and she really doesn't show a lot of interest in it. The product itself is nice, well made. For her teething I give her cold carrots instead and she LOVE them! LOL"
1,Where's the soul of this work?,"Albums are meant as a total experience. Good Charlotte's album is merely a collection of songs. Not very good songs too, I may add.My main grouse with this is 'Where's the heart?' The album just doesn't have a soul to it at all, it's just mass produced garbage. Don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to mainstream music. It's the fact that soulless and pointless works like these hog the limelight away from music that truly touches lives.Let's see. If you concur with me, click yes. If not, click no."
1,Bad Charlotte!,"No need to say more, these fags are just making lousy punk pop for the teenage girls and mtv watching kids who think they're quite rebel with listening to this kind of sheit, and these suckers do it just for the money like green day or blink 182. There just have to be some stuff like this to fill all the pop and mtv charts."
1,Good Riddance,"Another album by some pre-pubecent wanna be punk band. These guys always have been a bunch of rich suburban punks with no talent for being original.This album is another example of how MTV and commercial radio like to cram music fodder down the mouths of kids. Guess what guys, your are just another blip on the has been radar screen.Just another VH1 where are they now episode."
1,Garbage,"If anyone out there knows any thing about music or how to write music they know that it is easy to come up with cool, catchy parts. That is all this album is. It is a bunch of ""cool"" parts thrown together. Good bands write parts that make a whole. This band writes parts and throws them togehter, even is they make no sense. Good Charlotte is by far my least liked band in the world. I am sorry to those of you who think that this is music. It's not music, it is a fashion statement."
5,Good Charlotte is better,"I hate when people write reviews of how bands suck. I mean, I know you hate them, but you don't have to go saying that they are trying to be punk or whatever. I've read that they never said they were punk. Anyway, I think Good Charlotte rocks. They have matured so much, and their songs are more deep. I'd rather listen to this than to all the poopy stuff that people sing about, like big butts and stuff, so that's why I like Good Charlotte. ""I Just Wanna Live"" is more of the brighter songs that I like, and ""The World is Black"" is a darker one I also like. I think Good Charlotte has done great on this album, and it shows how much they have improved. I haven't yet gotten the CD, because I'm still deciding which one-- life or death (they're both great!!). I hope the people that wrote bad things agree with what I am saying. Over all, Good Charlotte is the best."
1,Souless music from empty shells,"Anyone who actually knows the genre understands that punk has been morphed by record companies into yet another money jar usedby people the music was originally against.Obviously a souless record with not a hint of rebellion in it.This ""music"" is the product of focus groups and record executives taking advantage of stupid people."
4,WHY ARE YOU STEREOTYPING THEM WHEN YOU DONT LIKE THEM??!!,"alright, i LOVE gc. so of course, im gona say that this was an ausome album and blah, blah, blah. but my only point in taking my time to write this is if you dont like them, leave people who do alone! dont try to convince them not to like them because they arent punk! WHO CARES?! i dont know about anyone else, but i dont want to hear crap like slipnot who screams about depression and i dont want to listen to the sex pistols because IM TOLD that they're punk and that if i want to call myself punk i have to like them. so LEAVE US ALONE AND LEAVE A REVIEW ABOUT A BAND THAT YOU ACTUALLY LIKE!!!"
3,Too Creepy...Too Much Death,"I am a fan of GC, but lately my liking of them has gone down a bit after this album. Though, I really admire them for their accomplishments and hard work, this album was not one of the best from the guys. To be honest, it just creeped me out with all the too many mentionings of death and dying and such. Their good and I don't know why people get all feudy about 'oh their not punk this band is, and blah blah blah.' It's lame. Could this world be any more fake and crueler than it all ready is? I'm actually giving this album 3 stars because they believe in God and GC sees just how bad this world is sinking to be. I'm just not into this 3rd release as much as the two previous ones. I love Joel though. :)"
3,SO UNPREDICTABLE,"Signed by Sony, Good Charlotte has released there new CD called ""The Chronicles of Life and Death"". GC provided two versions of the CD (one with the life cover nice and bright and Death which the CD cover is gloomy and dark). Overall the CD has some good hits and some hits that are so pop-rock, TRL kiddies will think they are NKOTB of 04-05. With the first single ""Predictable"" the songs do sound the same with rage and punk-rock beats and guitar sound. Out of the 15 songs, there are about 8 or 9 I actually like. If you are a fan of G.C. you'd love the album, for those knew to them, you'd have to sit down and really listen to them."
1,what the hell...?,"alright.. umm... I'm not sure what the hell happened here... but, I'm pretty sure this CD had WAY LESS EFFORT than it should have had... I use to enjoy Good Charlotte's first CD (I would easily give the first a 5 out of 5), and only a little of the second one, but this is pretty pathetic. I'm not sure who they are trying to impress, but, I guess if you're a little 13 year old with no sense of real originality, you probably love this album.. as for the rest of us, just go pick up a different CD... hell anything punk right now is far superior to this, even if its sucky wanna-be punk... cuz this sure as hell isn't anything close to 'punk'..."
1,NOOOOOOOO,"I thought good charlotte would quit but i guess not, they have to come back to make more millions for our punk, anti everything society. If you buy this you have made a few statements about yourself;1. Maybe if i get this, people will think that i actaully am as cool as a try to be.2. Boy i hope the guy at the counter realizes how punk i am while im buying this.3. Wow, i can really relate to the everyday struggles these guys are going through when theyre millionares living in mansions and still singing about the hard life."
5,Represent GC,As for ALL You little worthless wankers thet bag the crap out of Good Charlotte. You are a bunch of tossers that dont have any clue at all. if you actually listened to them instead of just bagging them you would see that they are a bunch of talented people that play awesome music and that know how to rock. do all us GC fans a favour and F**K OFF. GOOD CHARLOTTE ARE AND ALWAYS WILL BE THE BEST.
1,please just die already,i have always hated good charlotte with much passion simply a group of posers trying to play punk rock not sure why so many like them but its always the worst bands in the spotlight. I never bought this album but listened to it at a friend's house and advised him to burn it immediatley. It's painful to listen to one of the worst albums of the year.
4,Very good cd!,"I love this cd! Although it's not as good as Good Charlotte's second CD ""The young and the hopeless"", this cd is still really good. In some songs the lyrics amazed me so much like the last song ""Wounded"". The songs also have great melodies. The songs I like the most are ""Mountain"" and ""In this world (murder)"". You can tell that these songs come straight from deep inside the heart. It's much more dark and less rock than their other cd's but it's still awesome! I can relate to all the songs on this cd! I definitly reccomend this cd for people who like dark pop-rock, because that's exacly what it is, and I love this album for it!"
3,Both versions are the same,"Top songs-Once upon a time-""Chronicles of Life and Death"" wich is actually a good track-S.O.S.-""I just wanna live""-""Ghost of you""-""Secrets"" sounds like a 80s rock song.""Truth"" has a nice background instrumental-""We believe"" sounds like a 90s hit-""In this world(Murder)"" all the songs I stated are okay.I dont like any of the songs that sound like something a Sophomore in High school will listen to. There were some surprisingly good songs and it blows there previous album out of the water.Lyrics 7 Production 7 Music 8 Classic 7 Replay 6Total=6.5 out of 10 Fingers is what I heardTop 5 songs on here are1.We believe2.Ghost of you3.Secrets4.I just wanna live5.Truth"
3,Not their best,"Good charlotte are a good band, but this album is average, and a bit of a dispointing follow up from their fantastic album 'the young and the hopeless' track nine, 'the truth' is the best, i think. Worth a go.xxx"
1,"Congratulations, Good Charlotte!","Yes, congratulations. On this heaping pile of trash that is the poser kings third album, they have sold out even more than ever before. They sold out when their first album was released, that's undeniable. When 'The Young And The Hopeless' was released, they sold out further with the number one most overplayed song on the radio in 2002, ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous."" It was a great song...for about the first couple listens!! And now, on 'The Chronicles of Life and Death', they have gone rap and sold out even more on the number one most overplayed song on the radio in 2004, ""I Just Wanna Live."" Please, Good Charlotte...play some REAL punk, or just shoot and kill yourselves dead. Either way, you'll be doing the world of music a favor."
4,Different...but still great!,"I'm a HUGE Good Charlotte fan. I loved the album ""The Young and the Hopeless"" but this is just so different. Not that that's bad or anything, it just caught me by surprise. The song ""The World is Black"" and ""I Just Wanna Live"" sound great but not their normal music. But what is normal? I think it's great that they are doing different stuff. I just liked their secong album a little better. I still suggest that you buy this album."
1,This battery did not fit in my CU400 phone,"Although physically the same size as the original battery, it is notched differently. The original battery has a single notch and this battery has two notches which don't line up with the phone tab. Since the electrical connections looked the same, I modified the phone tab to make it fit but it would not charge. There must be some internal difference as well.I bought two batteries and tried them both and they both acted the same. My first attempt to make it fit was to widen the notch on one of the batteries so I guess that would make it pretty hard to return???"
3,Lackluster lyrics+Mediocre beats=Mediocre Album,"Lets face it. The Beatnuts do not specialize in lyrics. They are called the BEATnuts for a reason. In my Opinion, the Beatnuts should become producer and stick to producing, because when they get on the mic, well, let's just say it's not an enjoyable listen. The beats aren't too great either, and to get an above average review the beats would have to be fantastic on this one. The best tracks are those featuring other artists, with the exception of the single ""Watch Out Now"" which would make a better instramental, but a fantastic track nonetheless."
1,Trash review,"This is, hands down, the worst thing I have ever seen. Made on Friday afternoon with a budget of $12.50 it was a wast of film and time. I put it in the trash can and pretended that I never bought it. Don't bother, just don't."
1,Too Predictable,OK I know that I'm not suppose to give too much about the book but it's hard because it's going to be too much predictable I mean you read a chapter than it's like you read already. I wouldn't get it if I was you
4,Unbelievable By AB from North Boulevard,"The book I am reviewing is The Million Dollar Shot, and is written by Dan Gutman. I think this book deserves 4 stars because it's a good book but it's not suitable for younger kids. This book is about Eddie trying to make the million dollar shot, a basket from the foul line because his name was pulled out for the contest. The problem that occurs in this story is that he can't make the shot because he doesn't have his lucky coin. The problem is solved when Annie Stockley finds it for him. Does he win the million dollars? Read to find out! I'd recommend this book to 7-12 year olds because younger kids won't get it and 7-12 year olds like chapter books about kids their own age. I like this book because it has basketball. Other books by this author are Babe and me, Virtually Perfect, and The kid who became President."
5,The million Dollar Shot,"SarahThe Million Dollar Shot!The book that i have been reading is "" The Million dollar shot"". By, Dan Gutman. This book is about A boy who has a chance to win one million dollars by making a foul shot at the NBA finals.I would recommend this book to people who like to read about sports, or just basketball. This book is probably one of the best books i have read this year. I say this because i like sports and this was a sport book. This book could have been better if there was one or two more suprises. Other that this book was very good.One of the suprises could be that the boy gets a girlfriend or if some one famous asked to hang out with him or something like that. This was a very good book, that is what the book the Million Dollar Shot was about."
3,The Million Dollar Shot,"Million Dollar Shot: ReviewMy lit circle book, The Million Dollar Shot is a really good book so far. Eddie Ball and his Mom been dreaming of moving out of their trailer where they live but she lost her job at Finkle Foods. It's a good book because it describes a boy that's playing basketball and he enters a contest. The part I don't like is when Eddie says he'll make the shot at the end of the book. It would have been better if he left us hanging at the part when he shot it at Madison Square Garden, when it rolled around and around the hoop, wondering if it'll go in or not! Now, that would be suspenseful!!!!!!! If I had to rate it, I'd give it 3.5 stars. I would give it that because it's kind of a good book. But it is kind of boring if you read it for a second time!BY: Rigo"
3,i love this group toooo much.,"i have collected almost every cd available of the group, but still wants to know of some realeses of their albums.Love this group too much."
2,doesn't fit very well,it doesn't fit very well to my device cuz it has some gaps on it and it works less than one hour max
5,Perfect for your HDV-Z96 light,"These are lightweight, inexpensive and long lasting for your Camera lights. I was going to get the bigger version but a friend told me that if you have it mounted to a camera then these are the way to go. Once again we use these on the Z96-HDV lights."
1,Sony Replacement NP-F550 digital camera battery,Bought 12/15/11....Stopped working on 2/11/12. Less than 60 days. Will attempt to see if there is a warranty and if it is honored.
1,Doesnt fit lithium batteries,I bought this to go with my impact driver lithium ion set and it doesnt fit :( I think it fits Ni-cad old style heavier batteries.
2,With reservations,"I was dismayed that this Milwaukee tool is made in China. It works fine, but the plastic is a bit thinner and it feels a bit more fragile than the Dewalt light I have that was made in Mexico."
3,A little disappointing,"I was a little disappointed in this. It does blow the snow nicely, but it is awkward to hold and clears a very narrow pathway. Also, it blows the snow forward, so you have to be careful about how you go about cleaning your paths or you'll blow snow into areas you've already cleaned. It also kept unplugging on me, even when the cord was not pulled tightly. It does a decent job, but it's really almost just as easy to shovel."
4,SAVES YOUR BACK,I live in WNY where we get our share of snow. I contract someone to plow my driveway but there are spots he cannot get. This came in handy for the walkways. I was amazed that this lightweight product actually chewed up the ice & gave me a clean path to the pavement. I have back problems & this really saves on your back. I would have given it 5 stars except that it does blow the snow in front of you which is not very convienentwhen clearing snow. As far as the review I read TOTALLY WORTHLESS I would suggest that either the machine was not put together properly or she recieved a lemon & should return it because this little blower throws the snow pretty far but definitely works better when snow is not compact and heavy.
3,The Problem is with Customer Service,"I loved the snow blower but on about the third use the plastic blade unit broke. I had hit it against a railing so I understood that I had a role in this. I ordered two extra roller units from Snow Joe. They have not shipped after a week. I wrote several emails that only received automated responses. When I called, I was told it should ship later this week (two weeks to ship basic parts.) I asked why and the man said ""We are very backed up."" This is a neat product but the customer service is very poor."
2,Waste of money,"I read many good reviews of this blower, and i liked the price. Intended to use it to shovel my driveway and walk.Well logic tells you that if the snow thrower opening is in the front the snow will be thrown in the front...guess what, it is! It throws well, but no matter how many different ways I angled the machine to the side as the directions suggested, the snow still built up in front of me. gave up in the middle of shovelling. Perhaps I will use it for my deck next year, but what a waste for now."
3,Not that great!,"The machine works fine, but not great. Did not feel enough power to clean the side-walk."
1,"Garbage product, crappy company","Not only is the snow joe incredibly cheaply made, but when even the smallest part breaks you will find yourself going in circles trying to get any support from the company. You will call them and then they say to go online, you go online and your part isn't listed so you call again. they say to go online. go online again and youre right back to still having a broken piece of garbage. Toro makes an almost identical product for about the same price. You might be able to ""save"" $10 with a snow joe, but remember it is because it is $10 less for a piece of garbage."
2,Slightly below average,"The worst case scenario survival books are supposed to be a mixture of humor and useful information, but this book doesn't contain much of either. Any tips that might be helpful and actually usable in reality are few and far between, and the jokes are very weak."
1,Shi-ite,"This album is a total insult to the blues legends who wrote these wonderful songs.Any self respecting blues fan avoid this rubbish at all costs, it sucks."
5,Great variety of recipes for anyone interested in food by smoke.,"I have read several books on smoking meats...this is the best. Covers a huge range of recipies, but most importantly gets into the rubs and sauce side."
4,Smokin Assistance,"I purchased this book to provide a guide to smoking preparation for various meats, etc. The guide that the book provides is very useful and is used primarily as a starting point since the smoking process needs to be adjusted according to ones own preferential tastes. Many recipes are provided as well as guidelines - a good purchase for the price"
5,Excellent book!,I liked it so much I bought the latest version and gave the previous one to my daughter who also loves to cook.Excellent book.
4,book review,Great book as are all the Sandra Kring novels i have read so far. The book delivered quickly and was in good condition.
2,Disappointed!,What a disappointment this set was to me. It is so adorable in the picture and would have been perfect for my daughters room. I ended up returning it because when it arrived the construction was so poor. There were many flaws in the paint and one of the parts was cracked. I ended up buying a Level of Discovery table instead and am very happy with the quality and construction of it.
4,A Blue Gem,"I,ve had this saw over a year now and believe its main strength is its power. It can easily cut 3"" oak without bogging down. A vast improvement over my Craftsman lower end model. I also like the ease of blade height adjusment and the rip fence. Two things could be improved in my opinion: the blade bevel adjustsment and the blade guard. The bevel adjustment is inaccurate and the blade guard could have been designed more simply. Overall, for the price, I don't think there is any better than this. It will be a tool I will enjoy using for many years to come."
3,commendable lightweight,"I am into my fourth year with the 2703 and have so far found it to be a good value. I use it with the Rousseau table which makes all the difference in the world as far as this saw is concerned. The saw, table and very good fence that comes with the Rousseau table have taken a lot of abuse from me and look like they will last at least another four years or so. The rather flimsy power switch handle broke on the saw last year but I have been too busy to replace it. One note about the standard fence, has anyone ever found an adequate fence on a portable table saw? The fence that came with this saw is no worse than any others. There is a fair amount of run out on the arbor but with a good blade and judicious feed rates a clean cut is possible on hardwoods. On it's own I give the 2703 three stars, with the Rousseau table and fence it rates an easy 4 stars."
2,"Poor overall performance, not up to Makita's usual standards","While this saw is powerful and well balanced, it has several short comings. One of the most aggravating is the ease with which the depth adjustment slips. The depth adjustment's quick lock handle engages a locking bolt that runs in a slot. This bolt has a square section which has stripped out (with minimal use) and the bolt turns in this slot causing the depth adjustment to slip. It is not replaceable unless you completely disassemble the saw.The forward part of the base of the saw is not chamfered on the right side of the blade. This causes the saw to hang up when cutting plywood or other rough-surfaced wood, especially when cutting across the grain.Overall the quality of the saw is only average, not what I expected from Makita"
2,Avoid!,"Wish I had looked into this CD more before buying it. I found myself skipping each track as they had ruined each song... And before I knew it, the CD was done."
1,Please don't,"Terrible versions.Not because they are ballads.Just because they're BAD.There are good and bad ballads, these are the worst kind.Stay Away"
1,Wrong choice,"I was looking for this album which I have on vinyl. But the tracklist is not the same as on the original album. I should have looked more carefully. So for me, bad choice and sending back is no option if you live in Europe"
1,Not appropriate for preschoolers,This book is terrible for young children. I do NOT understand the NYT commendation. I returned this book.It talks about roosters being carried off by foxes and dogs that kill sheep that then have to be put down. There are illustrations of these events.I know these are real events but it was too much for my 3 year old and I don't consider myself over protective.
5,A book with compassion toward mentally ill people,"I am a Chinese who has been treated for mental illness. I also have a mother who suffered from severe mental illness throughtout her life. Being brought up in a very emotionally chaotic family without any outsiders knowing any of our family secrets was the only safe way we knew how to live.Therefore, I truly apprecite how Teresa was able to show her kind and brave spirit toward a mentally ill family member through her heart-warming writings. I admire anyone who can deal with mental illness and come out with such positive and compassionate attitude. Thanks to this soul reaching book, the healings started once I began to read Teresa's heart pouring words from ""Love Made of Heart""."
5,AN EXCELLENT COMPANION PIECE TO FR. MCBRIEN'S CATHOLICISM,"This text serves as an even more accessible text than the excellent volume prepared by Notre Dame's pre-eminent Catholic Theologian Fr. Richard McBrien's Catholicism. Together they give the student an invaluable overview of our Universal Catholic Church and her Faith, meaning and mission to the modern world.The Paulist Press as ever must be thanked for publishing such an important work."
2,Double fault,"Far too derivative for my personal tastes. As other have stated, these writings offer little original insight to knowledgeable students of tennis history. This book could've been a gem; it isn't. Personally, I recommend Peter Bodo's ""Courts of Babylon"" - evidently the writer of ""The Rivals"" liked it very much too!"
4,Fun for a little,"It is the funnest, cutest thing... for about 10 days. I grew attached to my grown upTamagotchi (a Kuchipachi to be exact), but then he had a baby and left me, and i abandoned the toy. Then again I am 18 years old."
4,Bill does it again,"I think Bill Phillips gives solid health/fitness advice, but the real key to his commercial success is his ability at selling ""transformation."" He does it again in this VHS, although you can get all three of his VHS tapes converted to DVD now, so check that out.This volume 2 of success stories is not as impressive as Body of Work or volume 1, but it does include one contestant who goes from looking like a washed-up high school gym teacher to a male model. Almost too hard to believe that happened in 3 months!"
4,excellent fast workout,"This is a great DVD for those of us who don't have time for a long workout. Since it's short, it's easier to 'just fit it in' rather than becoming a barrier because of time committments. You have to be careful as the other reviewer stated, need more warm up & stretching cool down. Also the moves are so quick, that sometimes they are done as a half move (i.e. not a full squat). While not ideal, it's also what keeps the total workout short, so that is a sacrifice. Also the DVD makes use of multi muscles moves which makes the time spent more efficient. The instructor for the 2nd workout is annoying with those high pitched 'whooo!'s, but again, I overlook it. Remember SOME exercise, even if short, is better than nothing."
3,It's okay,"I've been a group instructor for over 24 years and this video is okay. The first instructor can be a little annoying as she keeps saying throughout the video how ""we want abs like these two."" Saying it once is enough. It would definitely be challenging to a beginner with their 8 sec anaerobic drills/12 second recovery cardio sections. As a more advanced person, I'd prefer the drills to be at least a minute, but that's me. This video would be a great way for someone to learn how intervals work and to build up your stamina for cardio and resistance training."
5,wonderful,This is a great DVD from the Firm collection. It is a great for weight loss and making one feel great after.
4,good use of 30 minutes,"some Firm workouts don't leave me feeling tired. In the span of 30 min, I was out of breath several times, even after doing the workout many times!!"
5,Fitching a Wrong Sucker,"Buy this album, Buy this album, Buy this album!!!!! Steven Stapleton rarely ceases to amaze, and this is no exception. Originally released on vinyl on the TORSO label in the mid-eighties, this is prime NWW. Experimental as always, this album is, for lack of a better word, amongst the more ""ambient"" of the NWW works. Still challenging at times, this record is considerably more ""listenable"" than earlier NWW pieces. The only frustrating thing about this album is the back cover listing 20 tracks (A-T) but the cd itself only being indexed as three tracks. -What this means is that i am not sure if the best track on the album is called ""migration to the head,"" ""earthwork,"" red period,"" ""this lady is burning."" or ""chasing the carrot."" In any event, you need this."
4,A Great Read,"This is a great adventure and part of a three book series. If you like Tom Clancy, you will like Jeff Edwards."
2,Disapointing,While it was good to see the surface warfare teams get some just deserved praise the novel itself was a bit thin. I suppose its hard when compared to Hunt for Red October (The Novel not the crappy Film)but this novel lacked the depth required to be great. Certainly not enough technical elements and a plot that raced through at warp speed. I recomend you wait for Torpedo to hit the bargin bins before buying.
2,Not for an agressive chewer,The toy does have different textures but if your dog is an agressive chewer do not purchase. I will only purchase Orka toys from Pet Stages. These are the only ones to really hold up over time for my dog.
2,Too Cheesey,"Unfortunately I saw two seasons of Downton Abbey before I saw Upstairs, Downstairs so I am spoiled. Downton Abbey is such a better series. But it was interesting comparing the two."
3,"Not as good as Downton Abbey, although I'm sure two of the actors in UD were also in DA.","Too slow. I guess i'm used to the more updated version, ""Downton Abbey."" Maybe if I hadn't seen it before, I might be more entertained. Interesting to see two actors that reappeared in DA, only older...and even better."
4,Pre Downton Abbey,Old but good division of the classes in early 20th century Brittan. Well written and great cast. Jolly good show.
1,disappointing,This poster is a reproduction of a poster - you can even make out fold lines in the image. Not worth it.
1,It was great while it lasted,"I bought this card and a Magellan Explorist XL GPS from Amazon back in March or April. I plugged it in and it worked great ... until the other day when my GPS wouldn't start. I removed this card and the GPS started just fine.Since there is (apparently) no software in the GPS to format the card, I decided to put it in my camera which does have format capability. The camera simply rejected the card as unusable.Fortunately, I have a backup of all my map files and can hopefully restore them when I get a real card. I'm just glad I wasn't using it in my camera while on vacation.Now I'm worried about my camera card which is also a PNY but the 1 GB version.I think I'm going SD card shopping tomorrow."
4,"heat fast, so far so good","We brought couple of them. The soldering gun heated fast and maintain the temperature well. For those silver based solder, it require much higher temperature than the traditional lead based solder.I wish they design the soldering gun holder on top of the temprature control unit, so that it would not take separate work space away from desk. That is the reason for missing one star."
4,kennys behind the scenes,this is a cool dvd. it shows all that goes on during the tour. it only last around 45 min. but its a great way to see what it takes to set up a concert. after seein kenny this yr i think hes a great artist.
4,Perfect,"Just as described, fits perfect on our Ferret Nation Cage. Took away one star because I wish the fabric was a bit thicker to keep them warm in the winter. I have to use blankets too."
3,Missed,"I have to say that the book was ok. This was my first book from Mr.Reich. I've heard so many great things about Numbered Account that I wanted to read his latest book because the premise sounded interesting. While he did delve into financial crimes details which I enjoy, the story line was just not beleiveable. It just felt like something was missing. It was all too pat, the characters were cardboard.I am planning on reading Numbered Account and I am hoping that it will be better.But on the plus side, I'll still keep an eye out for what he will be writing next as I like financial thrillers."
3,"Money, money, who has the money ?","This is a novel by an author that I would have expected a better story line from coupled with more action and suspense. The beginning of the opening chapter left me still wanting to understand why they were trying to locate the $500,000 dollars being transfered from a foreign country. The obvious answer was it was headed for a terror organization, but that fact does not really emerge since the balance of the book is about following the money trail. And what a money trail we are led on. Literally through a plethora of the major banks of Europe and their regulations as to the disclosure of deposit records or ATM withdrawals. Again the book needed more action to make me turn more pages at a quicker pace. I found the end of the book a bit more exciting as the money issue is solved and the true purpose of the terror attack is revealed. Nonetheless this book was not really up to par for what I usually find in a mystery."
2,Reads about as exciting as an accountant's spreadsheet,"Adam Chapel is a CIA agent who is actually a forensic accountant. He follows trails of money. There is an apparent plot for another terrorist attack in the US. To determine the source of the plot and to stop it, the CIA uses Adam Chapel to follow a trail of money which presumably would lead to the terrorists. Teaming with Chapel is British agent Sarah Churchill. They must race with time to prevent another disaster of at least equal proportion to 9/11.A forensic accountant! Good G-d what will they think of next? Riech, a former banker, has written several previous novels concerning international high finance. All of them are considerably more successful thrillers than this one. There are many moments in this very long book that it reads about as exciting as an accountant's spreadsheet. The plot is highly predictable and the characters are, like this book, quite forgettable."
1,size 7 is not feminine,"the seller shipped had fast shipping but the ring was alot thicker than what was said. not much shine , the ring had no life, i had to return it"
5,So precious!,"I got this little guy as a gift for someone who adores my little blue point exotic shorthair cat. It looks just like him! It's so cute and cuddly I want one for myself. The quality is excellent, and the face is just too precious for words."
3,"Excellent value, good collection of some Boogaloo hits","This is various artists, not just the Joe Cuba Sextet - although two of his biggest hits are here. Also it is not an import (unless Santa Monica has declared independence!).This is a good disk to evaluate what ""Boogaloo"" (aka ""Latin Soul"") of the 1960's was all about. Most of the songs are pretty good, and four or five would be in any serious Boogaloo collection.It's about the best Boogaloo disk available under ... ."
2,Watch the original,The original movie under the same name was made back in Hong Kong in 1991 staring Chow-Yun-Fat and directed by John Woo. That was a good movie depending on if you can understand the chinese language or you can get it subtitled or dubbed but like always they make the dubbing sound like garbage. Anyway this sorry remake of a good movie has cheap acting and the movie overall itself I just didn't like. If you have seen the original then you may understand what I'm talking about. Its basically a low budget remake to try and bring in extra money. Spend your hard earned money somewhere else.
5,Just when I thought I'd lost faith in modern day rock...,"Stone Sour came along and proved that rock ain't dead. This is the first album I've heard by them, and I must say I love it. For the most part, it's raw, angry, heavy rock. The sound infiltrates your head and sucks you right in. There are a few tracks as well which are lighter, yet still rock fairly well. I have to admit, I like the lighter ones best, but there's not one weak track on here. You can completely immerse yourself in the intensity and emotions of this album, which seems to be a rare thing to find these days."
4,Strong,"As a guy who grew up on a steady diet of Dokken, Ratt, etc. My eyes were opened up when I purchased Stone Sour's new offering. I had heard 'Sillyworld' on KBPI several weeks ago and at that point I thought I was listening to a ""poor man's"" Pink Floyd cover band-I wrote Stone Sour off. Then, a few days ago, I heard 'Made of Scars' and I was hooked! I love this cd. A great blend of heavy, aggressive fist pumping tunes (30/30-150, Come What(ever) May, Hell & Consequences) with some very poignent songs like Zzyzx, Through Glass, and yes-Silly World. I will never relinquish my 80's hair band roots but bands like Stone Sour, Godsmack, KoRn, Puddle of Mudd, and others are definitely opening up my eyes to fresh, great new music."
5,Awaken the Diet Within: From Overweight to Looking Great Do,"Julia's is an inspirational story. In reading her book, I felt as though she was actually talking to me personally. Oftentimes, I find myself rereading passages in order to keep up my own motivation and self-promises."
5,good saw even better deal,"I purchased this saw about 6 months ago after hemming and hawing about the price and whether to buy new, used, or another brand.finally I bit the bullet, getting the $25 standard Amazon discount and selling the included drill to a friend for close to $100, it turned out to be a lot cheaper than used and reconditioned saws were selling on ebay.Boy am I glad I did. This tool is effortless to use and makes very clean, precise cuts. My only complaint if any is that it would be nice if they offered an adaptor to connect the device to your shop vac or dust collector as cutting a lot of wood you can create a lot of dust. Instead I'll have to figure out how to rig one up.Overall I can say this is the best tool in my shop."
4,Silly Stanley,"I liked the book. If I was 17 again, this book would have turned me into an anthropology major. Plus, I like people named Stanley. Great name, don't you think. ""HEY, STANLEY!"" ""Oh, Stanley"" ""Stanley, can I speak with you a minute?"" Has a nice ring to it. Anyway, I just wish he would have addressed why on earth don't people have fur? Most other mammals do, unless they spend a lot of time in the water. We do have a lot of hair on our heads. Maybe we evolved only partially in the water with just our heads stickn' out? Though men have fur on their faces. Figures, poor Lucy had to keep her face in the water looking for fish, Ricky jr. hanging on her hair while Big Ricky prostrates with our other male ansestors staying just out of reach of that nasty sabar tooth tiger. Some things never change! Who knows? Wish I did."
2,wrong headlight,ordered 97 S10 headlights got GMC headlight they do look a lot alike but they are not. and they even call for a diferent grill and bumper it looks like. i would think i can get this fixed with no problems
5,Excellent,"Emily Dickinson is an poet that has poems that are usually taken the wrong way. This book is an excellent way for people to understand the meaning of the poetry by Emily Dickinson. I personally enjoy poetry, and I especially think that Emily Dickinson is a very profound poet. She is one of my favorites. This book is an excellent way to start out in poetry if you have not paid any attention to poetry before. It is also an EXCELLENT way for people who are poetry lovers to expand your horizon."
3,"In short, its pretty average, but noisy.","I purchased this to play fighting games.PositivesIt does come with 2 different joysticks, which isDigital/Analog controlRelatively comfortable. Could be better, could be worse. Needed cushion on right hand and a little more base space on the left.NegativesIt ticks on all movements with the joystick. Very noisy and annoying after just an hour of play.It takes a long time to break in.The paint on the buttons wore off. This was okay for me, but anyone else who wanted to play had to figure it out."
1,Do not buy these sheets,I have been purchasing products on Amazon for 6 years. I have never written a review on any product that I have bought on Amazon. To express my distaste for this purchase I have written a review.I bought these sheets a month ago (May 2009). They were really soft and very comply. However after the 8th wash the sheets started to get sandy. It's been 2 months since I have had the sheet and they are very sandy. I am so dissatisfied with these sheets! I bought them because I wanted quality sheets that would last a long time. Now I am searching again online for sheets. I will probably throw these sheets away.Do not buy these sheets.
1,don't buy these sheets. Not what you think you are getting!,"Look, I love Amazon stuff. Buy lots of it! BUT, this set of sheets has turned out to be way less than what my good money purchased. Here's the thing, after 6-9 months one expects high quality sheets to stand-up to wear and tear. The fabric on these sheets have started to ""ball up."" Small fabric problems that make these sheets uncomfortable. Not a good purchase. Not the quality you might expect for your good money."
2,I've Had better,"I am not that pleased maybe could find a better thread count then this might return, it's for a full size but not on the spot it's to short and the corners are to far apart get a king size instead if yours is a Full sized and so on"
4,Quality sheets,"Quality sheets. I have only washed them once. They seem a little stiff at first wash, but I'm thinking they will soften more with each wash. Fit my mattress nicely. They are pretty wrinkled after washing, but what else would you expect with 100% cotton? I don't mind it, and I just iron the pillow cases, so they look sharp and smooth. Very nice feel to the sheets. Like I said - quality."
2,Rough sheets,I was hoping these sheets would be soft out of the package. They were not. I washed them a few times just to see and they were still rough. Not horrible but certainly disappointed. I usually don't write reviews but if you are looking for soft sheets- these are not them. They are however well-fitted and seem very durable and think.
1,AWFUL SHEETS after just 2 months!,"These are literally the worst sheets I have ever owned. They felt lovely at first touch, but they have pilled up and become scratchy and awful after just 2 months of on and off use. We use Frette and Pratesi sheets generally, so we know how to care for our sheets and those great brands hold up for DECADES without pilling. These are like what I slept on in highschool! Save your money!"
2,500? Really?!,"I honestly do not believe these sheets are true to the 500 thread count claim. You would think that sheets with that high of a thread count would hold up after washes (and ideally get softer). These sheets were soft initially but became so rough. I washed them in the gentle cycle, warm, and dried on low as well. They are fraying now and so rough. Ugh, what a waste of money! Also, the fitted sheet is not very deep. My mattress is about 13-14 inches deep, and the sheets do not cover all the way."
1,I am not very happy with these sheets,I ordered California king sheets and since I have had this bed for many years I know the bed is definately a Cali king but the sheets do not fit the bed. They are off the corners by morning. I have to say for sheets that you pay this much money for to not fit is just ridiculous. I would not order these again.Robin
3,These were OK.,"I thought these sheets were good for the money. They were a little baggy on my regular sized queen bed, but I thought they were soft and silky. The sheets have very deep corners and edges. I have to tuck them in all the way around on the fitted sheet. Now I will have to see how they hold up to a wash."
5,Very nice,"This was sent out quickly and the packing and case were great. It is inexpensive, so this is totally to be expected...but the violin is extremely light in weight. It is well-made and nice-looking, no problems at all. My concern is for long use, but for a start, I think it is lovely, and my son is very pleased with it so he can learn the violin."
3,"Item performs as described, good starter","My daughter got the idea she wanted a violin, and this was a good starter at the price point. It performs as a starter should, but do not expect excellent quality. The rosin was broken when we got it, but nothing major. The case was a nice addition and she has been happy with this gift every since she got it. If you do not have dreams of a future virtuoso based on this purchase, then drop the cash on this item and see if interest peaks to where you buy a higher dollar model."
4,what we expected,"I am no musical wizard, but my 8-year old woke up one day with a desire to play violin. He had been saving his money all summer and I figured it was better spent on a musical instrument than a video game! I thought that it would be a wood violin, but it seems to be a sort of plastic. It is great for what we need right now as he explores his new obsession! I will be signing him up for lessons soon and the teacher will tell me if it is truly a good beginner violin, or if we just wasted our money!!"
1,Bad bargain,"I knew the violin had a string missing, and something was rattling around inside it. When I took it to the music store to have a new set of strings installed I was told that it needed repairs which would come to $80 or $85. More than I paid for it! I will be returning the violin as soon as I can, as it will not be playable without additional money spent; if I spend that much I will get a new violin for my grandson. VERY disappointed!"
2,Disappointing,"The how-to aspects of the book are too general. E.g., ""Which [software] should I choose? The answer is the one you believe you'll feel most comfortable using."" And then the author goes on to list a few software packages and quotes their marketing info. The companion CD is a huge disappointment: here was an opportunity to develop and provide some business-planning spreadsheet templates. Instead, the CD includes exactly one file: a sample business plan (in Word format) for a proposed restaurant in Illinois. It's not a template -- just an example. It's pretty easy to find other examples by doing some web searching."
3,comfortably mediocre,yeah I can listen to the CD for hours but I don't get any excitement from it; I simply feel comfortable listening to the CD. A good ambient music.
4,"Not just great B flick, but a good flick, period","Recommended by a friend, and I'm recommending it forward.My haiku:Nazis invade earthfrom the moon - sci fi, yes, butgreat satire as well."
3,DISAPPOINTING,"For all the hype this summer it prove to be a letdown.Even Buffy the Vampire Slayer did not save it, just add to the mediocrity.It vseems like they coujld not decide if it was a drama, or a comedy, and failed both ways.The Germans would never have been so primitive, so uninformed. There would have been discreet travel between Earth and the moon for supplies, materials and updating the info of what was going on the Earth.figure out more for yourselves.BTW: the Nazis were never that self-centered or that evil. They were masters of mutual co-operation to achieve a common goal."
3,Iron Sky,"Not to bad a movie, special effects were suprisingly good. acting was a little over the top. by the ending dont expect a sequile"
3,Cheesy and not what I expected,Exellent plot but cheesy execution. Movie could have been more captivating. I really did not feel involved with what I was watching.
2,German Humor,"For me this movie failed to be sufficiently funny, have good CGI graphics, or have sufficient action scenes. The politically driven undertones are strong and difficult to ignore, though not pro-Nazi by any means. Also it is never explained why there is earth-like gravity on the moon. The movie seemed like a parody or spoof of movie that has never been made."
2,Stupid and boring,I know this is supposed to be a comedy of some kind but I found it stupid boring and offensive. Why don't you ask the millions of people murdered at the death camps if they think it is funny?
3,Subtitles - only when German is spoken,Disappointed not to have full English subtitle support on disk. English subtitles appear only when somebody is speaking German. You cannot toggle subtitles either.You cannot toggle spoken languages either.
1,Anti-American PROPAGANDA,They should warn us before they sell this trash to us without telling us its so full of anti-Americanism. I hated it. Im glad they lost their shirt on it.
4,Brave effort,"Not an unqualified success but still a remarkable, clever and very brave film. Sure the Nazis have to be stopped, but they ain't all bad. Well, at least one of them isn't! The story, and the film's style are reminiscent of the early Flash Gordon era of sci-fi story telling; but profoundly modernized. Where Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow fell flat on its face, this film does not. I was thoroughly entertained by the fast-paced story and enjoyed the dark humor and satire that permeates the film. The actors work hard and the heroine in particular turns in an excellent and likeable performance. The production values are simply amazing; especially when you consider the limited budget and where his film originated. So if you want something sci-fi, something different, then you'll enjoy Iron Sky as much as I did. Believe me the film makes far more sense than dismal outings such as the recent ""Battleship"" movie."
4,taken with a grain of salt,"Watched this on recommendation of Comic Book friend. It was a fun movie to watch. The battle scenes were shot really well, and the comedy of other scenes had me laughing! They shot the movie as if it was serious, and it hit the mark!"
2,Disappointing,"I can appreicate the work put into this film. However, I found it disappointing. As far as entertainment value the trailer was much better. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it wasn't a complete waste of time. If you need to kill time, and can bear to sit through an hour plus of sophmoric cheesiness and worn out cliches, this is an option."
4,Just what I expected and it was fantastic.,I've been waiting nearly 4 years for this film and it did not disappoint. Exactly what I expected. A satirical B-Movie with Great Special Effects and a fantastic score by Laibach. I recommend it to anyone that doesn't take their entertainment tastes too seriously and are open to B-Grade films. Fun!
5,Refreshing!,"This has got to be the best ""B"" movie ever made. Infact, it is a lot better than some of the ""A"" crap that Hollywood put out this year. My advice is to not spend your money on any of the offerings Hollywood put out, but, instead, buy a copy of Iron Sky. These Finnish Filmmakers have done themselves proud. Support them. :)"
2,Dissapointing,"generally bad. looks low budget, could've been a lot funnier. doesn't stick to one plot line just very disappointing and wasn't worth the 4 dollars."
2,Sad,"Tired and boring, sad story line. so close to being a cult classic but it in the end it fails! the ending credits show the global nuking which is what would be realistic to how the world really is, beside that it is a pass."
3,Strange,OK this is the strangest SciFi I have seen since Ice Pirates. It really defies description. It was entertaining to that end.
4,"fun movie, Fantastic CGI","This was a pretty funny movie. Some of the politics were over the top stupid, but I guess that is what you get these days. However the CGI was fantastic, the quality with which it was done made much of it seem very realistic. Fun flick, I hope the make some more quality movies."
3,SciFy channel. Please pay attention.,SciFy channel. Please pay attention. This is how one creates an experience on a limited budget. Mansquito ? puh - lease
5,great expect more from the second one,the movie was great it was really cool but seamed short the second one will probably be available in the next 4 to 6 years from 2013 they claim that they will take the graphics from the lord of the rings of the strange creature( i don't really like the movies ) and make it look believable
4,Iron Sky-Campy good fun!!!!!,"Iron Sky-Campy good fun!!!!! Doesn't take itself seriously. Over the top acting hits a home run! I laughed, I cried and enjoyed every minute of it!"
4,Nazi's on the Moon,"""Iron Sky"" is a fun parody once one can get pass the idea that the whole premise is absolutely ludicrous. Don't worry about how these folks could have possibly lived on the moon for over fifty years. They seem to have space travel down so perhaps they had freight ships providing them supplies all those years. The future President of the U.S.A. and her campaign for re-election is a hoot although it could also be a cautionary tale. Enjoy the movie for the comic book visuals and over the top caricatures."
1,"Wrong Region, It wont play",It is for Europe and so it is totally worthless to me I feel completely ripped off. it doesn't even make a nice coaster.
2,A bit misleading,"I got this book because the title seemed to suggest it would be a story about FOUR AGAINST THE ARCTIC. It's not. The book is an endless description of David Roberts research into the story I hoped to learn more about. While Roberts telling of his story is creative and his research thorough, this reader would have appreciated having a title that described what the book was really about. This is not the first time I have seen a book title by this publisher that seems to mislead readers just a bit. It's disappointing."
1,Look for adventure elsewhere,"While there are some interesting aspects of the story of Russian Pomori and the world in which they lived and worked, I felt my time committed to reading this was not well spent. I did however, learn something about polar bears, walrus hunting and Svalbard.The book had more to do with the author and his investigation, than the Pomori (seacoast dwellers) sailors. Perhaps this book should be in the ""How To"" section of the bookstore.If you are looking for an interesting Arctic adventure, check out ""The Ghosts of Cape Sabine."" This is by far a much better book; well documented and exciting to read!"
1,Junk Unlimited,"I have had these types of appliances since I first went into the service.This Krups equipment is worthless, usless and WAY over priced, OH did I mention useless and way over priced.DON'T BUY THIS BOAT ANCHOR.Cons:1. handle gets hot.2. outside of oven door burns paint off.3. WAY over priced. see cheaper ones, just because they don't have the Krups name, does not mean that they are not a much better purchase.4. I am not going to go on and on, I thin by now you get the idea.Pros:I gave the appliance to someone in the neighbor I don't really like, let them suffer with this junk."
4,Powerful Handbook,"A revision of the classic reference covering all important principles and techniques needed by practicing civil engineers. The new Edition incorporates changes in design and construction practices, especially in design specifications for construction materials, buildings and bridges, safety and health concerns, and the most current codes changes including ACI, AISC, ASTM, NDS for wood structures, etc. The Handbook covers systems design, community and regional planning, the latest design methods for buildings, airports, highways, tunnels and bridges. It includes sections on construction equipment, construction management, materials, specifications, structural theory, geotechnical engineering, wood, concrete, steel design and construction."
2,SOUL,"CANDY DULFER is definitely a very goodlooking lady. She is also a master of the instrument. She is a successful performer to her fans.But her SOULLALA is only ""So lala"" - no PEP, no IGNITION,French Fries without salt (the Dutch make them almost as good as the Belgians, or as good?..).Most performers get even better playing together with others. DAVID SANBORN/BOB JAMES, LOGGINS/MCDONALD, PATTI AUSTIN/JAMES INGRAM, CLARKE/DUKE : maybe she should try to play with some of the FIRST LEAGUE and she'll find out WHAT'S IT TAKE.................................. S O U L ! ! ..........................."
5,Long-lasting x 2,"Double-sided blade, very easy to install and last 4-6 months each side. First 3-4 months, it produces polished-like planning. I use Makita planer 2-3 times a week, sort of 40-50 bf/week."
3,a little bland,"I have nearly every Manowar album, with the exceptions of Fighting The World and Louder Than Hell (though I've listened to both quite thoroughly), and this just is not the best. The first sign of something wrong is the opener All Men Play On 10. The 'death to false metal' message is nice, but the lyrics are rather uninspired, and the music is slow. Plus, the bass solo on this one is boring. Overall, this album just seems tired and uninspired, as though they had no new ideas. Unfortunately, they did have a new idea after this, and it involved selling out."
5,Great looking watch for the money!,This is a great casual or dress watch. Very classy and professional looking without the big price tage. Numbers are large and fits great.
1,Nice whiile it lasted,I purchased this CD a few months ago and thought it was wonderful. The CD has not been played a great deal and was played on a Bose CD Player. It is now making so much noise it is no longer enjoyable. If you buy this CD just don't expect it to last too long. I haven't bothered to try and return it because I figured the return postage would probably cost as much as a new CD.
2,Starting to wonder who writes reviews..,"I'm starting to wonder who writes reviews. I would not recommend this book. The characters are not well developed. They're not really even developed. The Tree in The Giving Tree travels a greater emotional distance than any of these characters. The dialogue is not witty. The plot is weak and the book is not fast paced.It is an OK read for the price, especially if you've got some time on your hands and you'd spend the $3.99 on something more fleeting, like a Starbuck's coffee. Some of the character names are so silly they become annoying. (Lord and Lady Creamcroft? Is this story taking place in Candyland.) I probably would have been less disappointed if my expectations had not been mis-set by the reviews.Now as far a fiction goes, the review writers get five stars!"
4,Realistic and interesting story!,"This was a surprising find. The characters were very likable and real. The storyline was original and interested. Overall a fun summer read with the perfect amount of romance, intrigue and plot twists."
2,Constant Persuasion,The author and thus editors are so enthralled with persuasion that they spend their time trying to persuade the reader with their liberal bias. In writing a book instructing the reader to perceive persuasion it seems as if integrating the same techniques it is disparaging would be a bad idea. I have only gottnen through the first chapter and it has been unsettling. If you have to buy it for class I guess you have to but this would not be one I would hold on to.
2,Good Stories marred by Terrible Editing,"I first encounterede Fitzgerald's short stories when I was twelve and love the author. There are some good, often surprising, stories in this books with characters who could as easily live in the present as in the ""Roaring Twenties"" generation.However, the editing on this Kindle edition is a joke! Every two pages or so there were blatent spelling and grammar errors- disturbing to the point that I almost did not want to continue reading it. Free Kindle edition or not, no one should let loose on the public such haphazard and poor editing."
1,Lost in Translation?,"ASIN# B0002T22GO is supposed to include 2 bonus tracks, 'Blank' and 'Virus' (according to track listings at amazon.jp). When I ordered this item, however, this ASIN# was on the Amazon invoice but not on the item (anywhere I could see). The number on the spine of the item was 'EICP 424-5' and on the UPC symbol '4 547366 016765.'The item was made in Japan but was identical to the US Limited Edition CD + DVD with the same 12 tracks on the CD as the US release but no extra tracks. *Don't buy this item expecting to get the extra Japanese tracks* I think Amazon has the wrong ASIN# in the description or something else was lost in translation."
4,good flamenco versions of classic Christmas tunes,Ottmar Liebert does a great job of playing classic Christmas melodies with his own New Mexican style. His renditions are cheery and original. This is a great addition to any world music Christmas collection.
4,Refreshingly different,"While I am long familiar with most of the tunes on this album, the style of presentation is refreshingly different from all the other Christmas albums I have. I didn't get it in time to listen to it more than once, but it will definately be amoung the first next Christmas."
1,Too small to be working,I ended up returning the item - it looked and acted chip - the buttons wouldn't work and as simple task as skipping or rewinding a song was unacomplishable.
2,Good exercises bad cues,The exercise moves were good but she was off beat and not even the girls with her were on the same beat. She rushed you through the moves and you could tell she was reading and watching cue cards.
4,I like it,"I like this dvd a lot. If I'm tight on time I can choose just one 10 minute routine focusing on either arms, legs or abs. Or, if I have more time, I can put 3 routines together for a 30 minute exercise or longer if I want.It's great as a total body workout in itself and it works great as an add-on to other cardio work.The low intensities are definitely for beginners. I have to put the low and high together to get what I consider to be a decent workout but even then the next day I don't feel much. The arms workout isn't intense enough for me. I like this dvd as an add-on or when I want something efficient and effective. However it's not for those days when you want a really sweat-inducing tough whip you into shape kind of dvd, at least not if you're more advanced."
4,Great workout for the arms,"I agree that the instructor's ""deer in the headlights eyes"" may be a little off putting. I have been a real fan of the various The Firm exercise tapes/videos for some time. I really like almost all of the workout tapes/videos I have by The Firm, so I recently purchased more to expand my library. I was hesitant to purchase this video after reading some of the reviews. I felt I got a really great workout for the arms with this one. There were many arm exercises I had not seen before, which really worked areas that I have not used. I not only felt the burn, but was sore for a couple days thereafter. I am glad I made the decision to purchase this one. I was not disappointed."
5,Kluge Leather Travel and Sportbag,Best travel handbag ever made. Has numerous pockets within bag to carry all essential travel items including a pair of shoes.
3,Extension wand,"I purchased the 24' extension wand with the intention of using to power wash my house which is about 42 feet at the peak. Just to give some background I am 6' 2"" and about 230 pounds in pretty good shape. When wand is extended to about 12ft it is controllable but pretty heavy for long periods of time. But when extended to full 24' it is very hard to control due to the weight and flex. At the shorter settings is much easier to control and works well."
5,Easier and safer to a complete job!,"I just used it this morning to wash the upper half of my house, peaking at about 24 feet high! Though I expected for the wand to be rigid, it was not. There is quite a bit of flex in it, but after a minute or two of using it, I figured it out! I started off without an extension, planning on using a ladder, because that was the cheaper option; common sense kicked in and I found this on line. Super simple to set up and use. I do highly suggest that when you purchase this wand, you also purchase the strap and harness assembly. I'm a pretty big guy and I used every muscle fiber of my left bicep to accommodate this wand. Great product and completely satisfied."
5,My Cats Love It,"Length:: 0:55 MinsMy cats go crazy over this kitty snackThey gather up together and await these treats. Even my very fussy cats will anxiously anticipate this treat.From the left lilac Grandmother Elsa, center is Snoodles from my profile page and the right is silver tabby Hildegarde.My cats and me highly recommend this product."
5,Andrew wins the race!,"Andrew Sheehan has written a magnificent love story. He has learned, through painful experience and wry memory, that his parents were not perfect, but decided---as an act of will--to love them anyway. With heartbreaking clarity and astonishing delicacy, he recounts his life as a loner in a large, Irish Catholic family. His description of his descent into alcoholism is searingly honest and harrowingly unflinching in its detail. His struggle for recovery, floating and cresting like Gregorian harmony to his father's struggle to find meaning in his life as he faces death, is magnificent. The courage that it must have taken to write this book, as well as the talent that made it possible, are grand.If you grew up in a family, if you had a mother or a father, whether they were Irish or not, this is a must-read. Give it to everyone you know. I know I will be."
4,"Good, But...","...this CD would have been better if they had left out the story part, and filled the rest of the CD up with some of the score's from the movie. Look for a used copy of this CD, because you will be sorry you bought this at retail price."
4,Carpenters creativity overshadowed by vocals and overdubs,"For some the Carpenters music is too polished and the multiple vocal tracks can sound corny. Karen's voice is the savior though. Her deep alto voice is always a pleasure to listen to. They experimented with jazz and rock, especially the guitar solo in Goodby to Love. At that time they had backlash and some people thought it was a slap to their music. Like all good musicians they tired new things even though their fans weren't always appreciative. The songs are as memorable as Beatle tunes as they have a strong melody."
2,Carpenter's CD,"I love the Carpenter's music. However, my CD's both skip, ruining the continuity of the music. Now I'm actually reluctant to buy any more CDs."
4,rex,"pricing is awesome !!! have played with product, seems to have good clamp strength in all locations. i bought 4 clamps, one was slightly bent when i received product, don't seem to be a problem for my use. will put product under serious conditions in near future!"
4,Enjoyable music,I play the Rebec and wanted an example of ancient music to get the style. These are pleasant music pieces to listen to and a sample of that genre of music.
1,The worst bonnet I have ever bought. I will never buy any thing from this company again,It's the worst ever I will never buy anything from this co again. It's not worth the .60 cents to send it back. It is a rip off.
2,Super disappointment,"The movie has a nice start, towards the end it just gets quirky and dumb.If you got the extra cash go for it, if not keep looking around and drop this to the bottom of your list.I couldn't even give it a 3/5 'cuz of just the complete disappointment I felt by the end of the film in wasting time to watch it when I could be doing something, anything else like twirling my thumbs."
4,"Funny, creepy, sexy","Funny, creepy, sexy. Some very fine performances. The sex is actually sexy and important to the movie. Usually I'd just rather it were left out.Well done!"
3,Interesting,"Some great photography. Good sex. Surprising humor, that is most rewarding. Look at it as a relationship movie and it works."
4,Korean vampires,"Some weird, crazy asian narrative, but still far more interesting vampire than the ones that shine with daylight. The love story is bizarre and complex. Very enjoyable film. Too much attitude."
3,Another messed up movie,I suppose the reason there seems to be so many messed up Korean movies is because US distributors only pick stuff that sticks out from domestic films.Of you like messed up movies like Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance etc... you'll probably like this one. It's certainly original
3,a good idea cookpot,"This book will help beginning architectural students alot, lots of ideas about a large variety ot topics."
3,Third film slump,"A mad bomber (Jeremy Irons) terrorizes New York for a mysterious purpose that will not surprise those who are familiar with the way the stories of this series are constructed. John McClaine (Bruce Willis), suspended from the New York police force, and an unwitting cabbie (Samuel L. Jackson) get drawn into the non-stop action.This third installment of the Die Hard series just didn't grab me the way the first two did, but I'm not sure why. Watching it, I was struck by how outlandish much of the action was, but then some of the scenes in Die Hard 2 were just as ridiculous and I loved that movie. Perhaps there were just too many clichés, giving the film a tired, by-the-numbers feeling."
3,MUCH IMPROVED ON BLU-RAY,This is easily the best looking transfer of this film ever released with far greater picture quality than previous DVD releases. Though not a jaw dropping transfer like 'Casino Royale' or classics like 'The Searchers'-it's still much improved from the 'Die Hard Collection' version.
3,"Great film, horrible DVD","I won't spend any time talking about the film. Everyone else on here who says that is is a good film is correct.The DVD however is one of the worst I've ever seen. Whoever mastered it turned the edge enhancement up way too much. You see it the minute the Fox trailer comes on the screen everything looks too pixelated. The outdoor seens are by far the worst, everything appears grainy and artifacts are made more apparent. The indoor scenes are bad, but barable. Nothing like the ugliness that occurs everytime McClane steps outside.I have this film on LaserDisc also, and I guess I would rather watch the DVD because there is less chroma noise and the colors are better, but it is close. This is a good film and it deserves a better treatment than this. Come on Fox, get with the program.One more thing. This damn thing has the default sound in 2-channel, not 5.1. I hate that."
4,A classic part of a classic series,Bruce Willis is electric. Samuel Jackson is mesmerizing. Plot may be a little quirky and the Christmas spin is missing from the story line.
5,Laughter upon laughter!,"I ordered this book purely by chance; I was interested in the topic, and it has been a long time since I have laughed so much reading any novel. I have loaned my now severely dog-eared copy to a number of friends, who all loved it. Lerner is a great writer, with an ability to see humor in sadness. Some of his descriptions are genius! I absolutely love to account of the AA meeting! However - it sort of changes gears at the end. Lerner was a drug addict, and he did murder the man. I am concerned about the last chapter - has be become just like the general prison population?"
3,"Entertaining, but does not ring true","I found this book entertaining. It kept me up late, interested to find out what happened next. I'm sad to say I think it's fiction.Things just don't ring true. The guards are too sadistic. Lerner's cellmate is far too helpful and accepting. Some supposedly authentic dialogue made me cringe; it sounded like something I might hear on a made-for-TV movie on a network. Embarassing.Of course, it would have been appropriate for the author to change some names. I believe Lerner went far beyond this, unnecessarily embellishing, and that the book's impact is much reduced as a result."
5,Five Star Book,This is by far one of the most entertaining books I have ever read. Mr. Lerner manages to interject humor into a horrible experience. I read the reviews and I don't believe that he is attacking Alcoholics Anonymous. He approaches the subject the same way he does all the other subjects in the book - from his own darkly funny perspective. Two thumbs up...
3,nice work of fiction,"I found it to be a interesting book. Being a correction officer I found alot of what he has to say about prison life to be true, but alot of the book seems to be pure fiction to me. Then again C.O's and inmates always see things differently. I enjoyed reading it. For a different point of view on prison life try reading Ted Conover's Newjack guarding Sing Sing"
5,fascinating and hilarious,What surprises me most about this book is how laugh out loud funny it is. It's one of the most humorous books I've ever read. This is in contrast with descriptions of what is best described as a living hell. Jimmy Lerner provides a realistic and captivating account of prison life. I only wish he'd write a part two.
5,Fabulously entertaining although self serving,"I loved this book. The author really has an ear for the lingo and an eye for a situation. I think that you will like this book as well.Just read an account elsewhere that the author likely is far more guilty of outright murder than he makes out. In that, he is the typical ""innocent"" con.But, that said, I read the book several times over the last year or so. He finds funny situations - made up or not."
5,Great!!,The product was the exact one I needed and thanks to Amazon I was able to easily order and purchase the item. It was as expected and arrived promptly.
5,Delirious,I bought the CD for one particular cut on it but ended up loving several others ones.. so happy I bought the whole CD and didn't just download the one favorite song off ITunes..
4,First Delirious CD,"I purchased this album after hearing the song ""Inside Outside"".This album does not disappoint and gets played frequently in my car.There is one thing that absolutly drives me up the wall...on the song ""Majesty"" the guitar player drags his fingers on the strings while changing chords and it makes a -VERY- bright raspy sound.This might not be noticeable in a car but when I play it on my ipod the rasping sound is front and center in my right ear and just about makes the song unlistenable. I'm pretty sure the guitar player has years of experience so I can only guess he or the producer thought it would be ""cool"" to allow the fingers to drag across the strings...I sure hope he doesn't do that in the future. Arrraggghh like fingernails on a chalk board! =("
1,Can get stuck around the neck!,"First of all my pup really didn't like this toy very much. It kind of makes a crunchy sound. Mainly I'm giving this toy 1* because I came home one day to find my pup's head in the middle of it and this thing around his neck! He's lucky he's so small and it didn't choke him as he struggled to get it off his neck. Beware leaving your pup alone with this toy as it can get stuck around a little pup's neck. Maybe this is fine for big dogs, but NOT for small dogs - I have a Maltese. I'd ONLY buy this for big dogs."
5,Very Durable,So far my 9 lb morkie destroys all puppy proof chew proof toys!! These however last amazingly well. I since had to enclose his squeaky toys in heavy duty work socks to keep him from potential harmful digestion of pieces of the supposedly puppy proof heavy duty toys! These Pet Stages toys have been wonderful though.
5,My puppy LOVES this toy!,"My 13 week old scottie puppy just loves this toy! You can play tug of war with your dog and it's a great toss toy. My puppy is teething, we will see how it holds up but so far so good! I'm buying more!"
1,"Childhood Shadows = flimsy, opportunist writing","This is NOT convincing. The data she presents is highly circumstantial at best and inadequate. Pacios's attempt to accuse Orson Welles as the killer by backing up her diagnosis of his ""secretive"" sociopathy through an examination of Welles's movie props,off-screen behaviour and sudden trip to Europe following the murder cannot be justified in any way. I do hope she has a good lawyer in case the people handling Mr. Welles's estate ever sue her for slander and libel.For you Dahlia die-hards, John Gilmore's Severed is where you want your money. It's much more credible and convincing and certainly the more authoritative as well as professionally written treatise on this highly controversial subject."
3,Cheap mounting construction,"It serves it purpose, but it is a very cheap piece of hardware. The most vulnerable parts are the mounting brackets which can easily break if you have them on the back of a door or inside a closet wall.Again, it works. It just doesn't make you feel like a great purchase."
5,Incredible,"I have tried every type of tie rack under the sun. This one is cheap, effective, and works great. I screwed it to the inside of my closet door and it looks great. I need more ties now. The ties don't fall off, there is a bit of friction on the tip of the hook to keep it form being able to just fall off."
4,Works well and holds a lot of ties,"PROS: Installation is easy, organizer holds a lot of ties, ties easy to get on and off organizer, individual tie holders can hook onto the neck of hangers for putting outfits together, hanging ties makes color/pattern easy to see when choosingCONS: Distance extended from the wall could be longer so that the wide end does not touch the wall"
3,Who's that girl? And why did she bother?,"""Filth and Wisdom"" is Madonna's 2008 directorial movie debut. Overall the movie was fast-paced and not too interesting because it moved around in many different directions. If you're looking for this film and stumbled upon this page don't worry because there is a US DVD that is out now. You can find it at the Blockbuster Web site. They are the current official/only distributor of the DVD in the US. Although their DVD is a previously viewed copy I don't think anyone would mind as it's available now and less than the DVD on this page. There's also a Canadian DVD and a region 1 DVD from Japan, however these are each more expensive and this site isn't offering either one. (They are selling theFrench region 2 DVD, however that will not play on most US machines.)"
1,Fall and decline of the Republic serial,"This was the last serial to be made by Republic. For the serial fan it was no great loss. It is Dullsville incorporated with poor production values, a lacklustre but sometimes unintentionally hilarious script, dull acting to match the screenplay and other sundry deficiencies. Only positive aspect: the usual good print from Republic Home Video."
3,Disappointing. Not enough Joanne-too much other guy!,Content is good but Joanne's clear vocals are conspicuously absent
5,I love this tool!,"OK, it's my first biscuit joiner, I'll admit, but I have only nice things to say about it. It received an excelent rating in the Taunton Press tool guide and was one of the mid priced models, so I took the plunge (so to speak) and it has definately proved itself . I've used this tool for quite a few projects and it has worked smoothly and flawlessley. joints come out tight and perfectly aligned. There is only one drawback that comes to mind. It seems to be an excepted fact that the dust collector, as with most biscuit joiners, is not worth using. If you use the dust bag it will plug instantly. As someone else here recommended, I just turn the discharge nozzle away from me or to the floor and sweep up the chips later. I did connect it to my home central vac system with a rigged up adapter once and that seemed to work well but isn't always so convenient for me.All things considered, I appreciate quality tools and am not dissapointed by this one. Highley recommended!"
3,Adequate but not Outstanding,"The Makita Plate Joiner is adequate. It cleanly cuts space for bisquits and stock can certainly be joined. However, the switch does not permit finger control. You turn on the machine, then position it and cut. My old Porter Cable overcame this disadvantage and was easier and more accurate to use as a result. I wish I had bought the Porter Cable model again (mine was stolen)."
2,sloppy tolerances,"I am surprised by all the positive reviews of this product. The adjustment stop on mine is slightly out of alignment causing the stop bolt to bind with the adjustment mechanism. Instead of returning for a new unit, I disassembled the stop adjustment knob and filed it down a bit so that the bolt would not rub against the knob. My major complaint is with the rack and pinion adjusting fence which is not parallel. The pinion gear is only on one side of the fence and there is over 1/8 inch play from side to side. I will need to check the fence after every adjustment. Fortunately as a hobbiest, I don't have to deal with setting the tool up all day long. I am considering returning it for the Dewalt."
5,Beautiful Doll.,"I bought this doll on ebay for my daughter for christmas because it wasnt available in stores. My daughter who just turned 6 yrs old loves this doll. Doll speaks both english and spanish. The only thing I dont like is that this baby keeps going to sleep after meals, but if your child wants to keep it awake you can press the bracelet or put the bottle in the mouth. Its a good thing if you dont want to run out of batteries soon or to give the doll some rest."
2,IT DID NOT COME WITH ENOUGH DIAPERS,"THE DOLL IS HEAVY. IT ONLY CAME WITH 2 DIAPERS. THEREFORE, THE DOLL COULD NO LONGER BE FED OR GIVEN A DRINK AFTER 1 FEEDING. MY DAUGHTER WAS EXCITED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE DOLL HAD REAL BODILY FUNTIONS. HOWEVER, SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE SHE WENT THROUGH THE 2 DIAPERS AFTER 1 FEEDING."
4,Very good read,First read this book when I was a kid. It helped shape my attitudes towards aquarium keeping. Since then I have earned numerous awards for my aquariums and aquarium keeping articles.There are better techincal books out there but this is a great book for any aquarist.
1,Wrong cd,It was Vivaldi but not Madrigals at all. Wrong. CD in the box. I prefer not to bother with sending anything back. I don't mind. I would like a Cd of Madrigals if you care to make up for the error.
5,Functional and fun.,"I used to work for Billabong (who owns Nixon) and I have the black Vega and the white marbled acetate Vega. This is a really fun watch, and I would always recommend this watch to younger girls. It's not too expensive, and is a good beginner watch for girls who are more into jewelry, and don't ""do"" watches. It's also fun for when you are looking for something to wear to a bar or club that's just a little different. I get compliments on this watch all the time, and my friends are often borrowing it. it's a great gift and the fact that it's waterproof is a definite bonus (Vegas pool [parties, here I come!)."
2,Takes some getting used to.,I have these shoes in Purple/ Lilac and brown. They are very cute and stylish but unfortunately wearing them from my home to my car was painful enough yet alone walking in them while out and about the first tine I wore them. These are not recommended if you have a lot of walking to do. The style is perfect but not so much for comfort.
5,No Letdown,"I enjoyed this as much if not more than its predecessor, Forgotten Prophecies. While the size of the tale is intimidating at first, I quickly became enthralled. At any given time there are several storylines taking place, and unlike most of these situations where you have one or two you can't wait to get back to, I was genuinely interested in all of them. In addition, as a person who generally doesn't like his fantasy and his sci-fi intertwined, in this tale I didn't mind it at all... which is high praise from me."
3,2nd-Rate,"A movie with stars like these - what could go wrong? It has superlative film noir photography, that's for certain. I've always so enjoyed Charles Boyer with his deliciously thick French accent - so how could he be mistaken by a French cop in Paris for a German?!? And the cop sounded American next to Boyer! And charming Louis Calhern - I've always enjoyed him. But Russian? Try as he might, he could not muster a convincing Russion accent. There is no actor I enjoy watching more than Charles Laughton. But in his two dialogues with Boyer he sounded positively second-rate. After having been referred to as an evil Nazi officer whom Boyer wanted to kill he sounded like a pussycat. And his German accent was almost non-existent - as if he didn't know how to speak it.This was certainly no ""Casablanca"" even though Ingrid Bergman was her usual wonderful self. Even though the script was inferior she milked it for all it was worth but even she could not lift the film above mediocre status."
1,Why would some Maiden fan want to buy a thing like that !,"I can't understand the reason for compilations like this, about a band that is still active, recording and touring around the world. Sometimes old classics receive a fresh version, sounds more alive, but the bands involved in this project belong to minor league, has nothing to add to Maiden's discography. A total waste of time and money."
5,fantastic!,"I bought two of these lamps, and they made my bedroom look fantastic. It was wierd that the sticker on one lamp said ""use 60 watt bulb"", and exactly identical sticker on the other lamp said ""use 25 watt sticker"". I bought two 15 watt energy saver bulbs that give as much light as 60 watt bulbs, and that solved the problem. Nice and bright! Also lamps arrived way before the estimate delivery date. Very pleased with this purchase."
2,Not half bad,"If you've got all of Tito Puente's recordings and want something a little more ""offbeat"" try Charlie Palmieri, although his ""Latin Bugalu"" is a better cd, to start with. This cd is strictly for his obsessive fans who need everything he recorded, this is more fanly then jazzy, so stick with Latin Bugalu, one of his earlier jazz salsa records, but skip this, until you've already bought all his other recordings."
2,"started with a bang, ended with a whimper","Read this and got all hyped as the angle Peter Theroux takes is great in weaving the history of LA through his own experiences amongst the translation and tutoring community. Plus he is not cynical unlike his more famous offspring, Paul.Problem is he eventually lost the plot and only the actual stuff on the history of LA starts to resonate. You can get all this elsewhere and, frankly, I grew not to care at all about Theroux's life in LA. Not that it needed to be Hollywood and Vine or Cribs vs. Bloods but it just went nowhere sort of like driving endlessly on LA's freeways and never getting off (pun intended)."
1,Material to be AVOIDED,"Unless you're heavily into Goth and whatever all goes along with that, which in this is coming on to your college professor (when he's the same sex) and dressing up goth at all times no matter how ridiculous it is, then avoid this like the plague. This is an absolute piece of crap and I can't believe I watched the whole thing. Thankfully it's now down at the trade in store waiting for some other poor sucker to come along, if that hasn't already happened. Bleah."
5,Great Gift,"I bought this cd for my uncle, he had been looking in stores all over and I took the tip and decided to go on line to find it; and sure enough amazon had it and it arrived just in time for his birhtday!!!Zusset"
3,Buy one- a used one,"This book is a good quick read the week or two before the test. It gives some cases and will tell you what the graders are looking for, when they deduct points, etc... The only problem is that it doesn't explain anything. My whole class borrowed books from a few gunners who bought the book early."
3,It's OK,I only like a few songs on it. I only got it because I liked one song. It wasn't like I expected it to be.
4,Hummel price guide,"Guide was very helpful in getting the information about names of figurines, and price ranges."
2,"Shallow Content, Many Errors, Poor Examples","I almost always turn to O'Reilly first when purchasing a new reference book, however this time I was disappointed. This book is fairly shallow in content and much of the information that you need is actually buried in the text instead of being presented as a topic unto itself.The thing that is the most bothersome, however, is the plethora of flat out errors. Many of the examples have typos, missing code, etc. Even as a PHP novice I was constantly spotting errors which is frustrating when you're trying to learn the language.On top of that, many of the examples exhibit just plain bad programming form (inefficient code, variables that are only used once, etc). It's the kind of thing that makes a seasoned programmer wince (and if I was reviewing the code I would send it back to the author with lots of red ink)."
2,Poor Book for Beginners!,This book is really hard to understand for beginners. Topics jump all over places. It's so unorganized to follow. Trust Me this book is not for beginners.
2,Lack of Examples,This book lacks examples. It describes a function in English words but rarely gives an example of how to invoke it. If you're trying to do File I/O this book is NOT for you.
3,average php book,"this is a thin, mediocre book. at 373 pages, not counting the appendix, this is not a thorough treatment of the language. Maybe Oreilly should rename this ""Learning PHP, and put out a thicker, more in depth book that will teach you everything you could possible want to know about php. Think Programming Perl 3rd Edition."
2,"The book is 'OK', but not great","I used this book at work, and wasn't impressed.Now, maybe it's the language itself that lacks consistency and isn't all that interesting, I don't know.I wasn't as much exceited reading the book as I was when I read, for example, K&R; (C), Paul Graham and Peter Seibel (Lisp), Meyers (C++). The book will help you get things done, no doubt, but there doesn't seem to be anything special about it."
5,Best series ever,I started reading this series to my boys when they were in 4th and 5th grade. Then I took it to school and read it to the 5th grade class. They loved it so much they never wanted reading time to end. We even gave the 3rd book to a friend in the class for a birthday present which he loved. It has now been 6 years since I first read this series to my boys and they still talk about them. I recommend this to every mom who has a boy struggling with reading or getting excited about a book. I love the math codes they fit in and the adventure. I enjoyed these as much as my boys did. This is not just a boy book the girls in the class loved it too but it will get boys interested in books for sure. happy reading
5,"This is a rough framing planer only, not a door planer!","This planer should be located in a framing contractors tool box where it belongs. It might be able to ""fix"" a stuck door, but for production door milling use the correct tool, such as a Porter-Cable 9118 Porta-Plane (formerly the model 126). This tool is best used to straight line wall studs before drywall (& insulation) or for general framing use. Do yourself a favor and throw away the fence, as it will only frustrate you. Use a jointer or a table saw to square edges correctly.This is a fairly rugged tool that is able to go through a couple of hidden nails before replacing the disposable blades. It is a Makita, not a yellow repackaged Blackened/Decker!"
5,"A brilliant analysis of law, information and the market.","I have both just finished Boyle's book and his Torts class at Washington College of Law. Boyle's analysis is strikingly clear. Taking as one of his launching-off points the important California Supreme Court decision in Moore V. Regents of California, Boyle tackles issues ranging from the commodification and distribution of information to the creation of legally protected property interests in biology. He exposes that courts make decisions based not so much on ahistorical, immutable legal principles but on policy considerations often directly related to contemporary trends in economic thinking. Boyle, despite several references to Marx, is a defender of a uniquely American kind of privatized safety regime in the form of the tort system. This has confused careless readers as evidenced by Huber in the pages of the NYT."
2,buy it for the good songs,"I am a huge and hardcore sublime fan. 40oz. to freedom is my second all time fav. album. This is good for the fans but not for the casual or first time listener. It has good songs. ""Saw Red"", ""Greatest Hits"" and ""Boss DJ."" I would have like to have heard Sublime re-record that song in the studio because it is such a good song (good to learn on guitar and play for friends. Easy too G and C all the way through). Anyways."
2,Their worst cd,"Sublime is my favorite band, and this cd was a bad sublime cd. The songs are stupid, and not even Sublime could make them good. I know it's tempting to buy it if you're a Sublime fan and think ""nothing that sublime does can be bad"", but this cd is really stupid. Don't buy it."
4,Robin' the Hood is a great CD for everyone,"For everyone who enjoyed 40 oz to Freedom, Robin' the Hood is the next logical step on the road to becoming a true Sublime fan. Robin' the Hood is much more experimental then their previous CD, 40 oz, but all the more fun. The band lets loose, showcasing their musical abilities, and their talent of writing great songs. There are a number of remarkable tracks on this CD including an amazing guitar solo ""Falling Idols"" and an incredible bass-ballad ""Stepping Razor"". While many of the songs are sound clips, or obviously just the band messing around, you can't ignore the genius behind this CD. ""Saw Red"", ""Boss DJ"" and the infamous ""Pool Shark"" call Robin' the Hood home, making this CD worthy or anyone's collection."
4,"""...I earn beer""","Some people say get the other CD's fist and I agree. This was the first CD I bought from Sublime, after heard it the fist time I just put it away. Not having a good opinion of Sublime, I managed to catch part of a documentary of Brad on one of the music chanels. After hearing all the good music they have put out over the years I started listening to this CD again (and bought all the others). This CD is different, funny at times but give it a chance, you won't regret it!"
1,Josie and the Boring-cats,"Like most people, when I saw the previews for this movie I was excited and couldn't wait to see it. Well, when I did see it, I was very disappointed. This movie was very boring and very stupid - I am sorry to say. It starts off with a bunch of fans screaming over a boy band, played by Seth Green, Breckin Meyer, and a couple others. This short beginning may well be the only funny part of the movie because of the actors. However, the rest of the movie goes down hill from there. I found myself waiting for it to be over. Though I like Rachael Leigh Cook, all three girls were boring and obnoxious - especially the ditzy Melody (played by Tara Reid). Rosario Dawson was a worthy effort out of the trio, the only one with a little brains. Again, I wanted to like this movie, but what you feel like afterwards is bored and irritated and wishing you hadn't spent your money on this movie. Please take my advice and stay away from Josie and the Pussycats - I can gaurantee you'll be happy."
3,This version is NOT widescreen,"Just a note: while this ""Edited for Family Version"" is the PG cut, it is NOT in widescreen as stated by .... and on the disc itself. It is in fact in ""full screen/pan and scan"" mode"", i.e. the film has been modified to fit your TV screen.A disappointing move by Universal, as I WOULD have preferred the edited version. Interestingly enough, all of the trailers, music videos and clips from the movie (used in the various behind-the-scenes featurettes) are in widescreen. Why they decided to hack the film's aspect ratio is a mystery.While everything else about the disc is great, I can't give it the full five stars because of the non-widescreen format."
5,ORDER THIS!,"Wassup, America?! First of all, this movie rocks. I am male, but I love it. NOT JUST A CHICK FLICK! GUYS LIKE IT TOO! Good choice for everyone who likes movies of this genre. I don't own the DvD. I taped this on the STARZ channel one night while they were having a free preview weekend thingy. I gotta buy this in the next year. The actresses that play the Pussycats (Rachel Leigh Cook, Rosario Dawson, Tara Reid) have been in some other great movies. Rachel was in She's All That with Freddie Prinze Jr. Rosario Dawson was in Men in Black 2 (another awesome flick; I got the dvd for christmas). Tara Reid was in three of the BEST MOVIES EVER MADE! American Pie, American Pie 2, and Van Wilder! I love all those. If you like teen movies, the Pussycats are right for you!PEACE OUT!in the immortal words of Smokey from Friday:""...and you know this, man!"""
3,Not that worthy of 5 stars,"This movie was really good had it not been for the way out there plot and some of the acting was horrible. Rachael did a good job as did Tara and Rosario but the rest of the actors tanked.The movie was about the three cartoon characters from Josie and the Pussycats and in the movie the band was being pimped to sell trends to the youth of America. Now Josie, Mel, and Val must save the youth and themselves from the mean Fiona and her partner in crime Wyatt.Also I loved the romance between Josie and Alan M. It was so beliveable to watch. And the effects were awesome but also silly at the same time.If it weren't for the acting and effects I might've gave this movie one star.Penny Lane"
2,Not that great ...,"In seeing the trailers to this for months it seems, I have to confess that I was curious to see how the movie turned out. In recalling the cartoon of the same name, it made me even more curious as to the results of this movie. While there were some humorous parts, overall it was a big disappointment. The music was not good, the acting was not good, and the plot was not good. In essense ... the movie was not good ... just a bunch of hype."
3,"Smart premise, bland execution","Like so many Hollywood films, this has a great ""high-concept"" premise. It's also smart and sharp, which is rarer. The film opens on a hilarious note, satirizing the commercialization of rock music.But like so many such Hollywood films, it doesn't much go beyond the premise. After the first 5-10 minutes, we ""get it,"" and the rest of the film just recycles the same joke. Film opens big, hilarious ... then limps to a weak ending.Alan Cumming and Parker Posey are superb in supporting roles as the villains. I wish the film was about them, instead of about the bland good guys. The villains were interesting and multi-dimensional, despite their smaller roles. Even when recycling jokes, Cumming and Posey's characters were a pleasure to watch.Trivia: star Rachel Leigh Cook played the younger version of Posey's character in House Of Yes."
5,Rock on Pussycats!!,"I couldn't stop watching Josie and the Pussycats after I got started. My favorite character, Melody, is just so cheerful and happy, it makes you like her. Each character has something comnpletely original about her and that makes them so much more believable. Don't wait another day to see this totally awesome, hilarious comedy!"
5,"""I'm Not Saying a Word.""","Though it is a bit crude in some parts, BLOOD BROTHERS remains and probably always will be my favorite musical of all time. The plot of the story revolves around a set of twins (Mickey and Eddie) separated at birth because their mother cannot afford to raise two more children. A deal is struck with the infertile employer of Mrs. Johnstone, Mrs. Lyons, and one of the children is raised by the Lyons in luxury. The only catch, no one must ever know the truth. As life has it, the boys eventually meet anyway and become the best of friends, blood brothers.Willy Russell created a real gem here. BLOOD BROTHERS is a moving musical filled with all the tragedy and comedy of life, but without resorting to sentimental sap. The play exposed and illustrated to me the fatal flaws of the British economic caste system in a way far better than any other piece of literature ever has. It's a great play and though the moving music is not found here in the script, there's still the story."
4,Blood Brothers-Willy Russell,Enjoyed this book to do with my sons school work and went to see the play at Embassy Theatre in Skegness.
3,Very Powerful Smell,"The sticks need cut down some. They seem way too tall for the dish. Beware, the smell of the fragrance is very strong. Nice but can be headache strong."
3,Passable Rendition,"This movie is really an amalgamation of 2 of the books: A Wizard of Earthsea, and The Tombs of Atuan. They are blended together into an unsatisfying parallel. A great many liberties are taken with the books and the characters.Given that, I still enjoyed watching this film, although I consider it to be a dumbed down version of the books. The only character I really felt any empathy for was Vetch - he seemed to be well cast.If you have already read the books, you will not enjoy this movie - unless you can accept this movie on it's own."
1,Like it was based on the book report of a 10 year old who never read the books,"Horrible, and terribly disappointing! I've read, and loved, the Earthsea books since I was 13, well over 20 years. I saw this at the store and grabbed it, having never read a review. I had to FORCE myself to watch the entire thing just because I paid $15 for it, and I'm still angry over wasting my money. The only things they got right were the names of the characters, and even then, not entirely. Who the h*** is King Tygath??? And when did the Tombs of Atuan become a place of good and light??? Evidently, whoever was involved in this movie, actors, writers, producers, etc...never read the books, or they'd be as horrified as Ms. Le Guin and her fans were. And I still want my money back!"
2,bla bla blaahhhhhh,"Not much to say, the other reviews capture the non-essence of this TV movie.It's not totally horible, 12 yr. olds might be able to waste an afternoon on it. But otherwise it's just boring.I wish the Sci-Fi Channel would make 3 or 4 great mini-series instead of 10 bad ones."
2,probably nice to look at naively,"I haven't seen much of this miniseries, but that is partly because I couldn't bear to watch the New Age character interpretations and partly because the script lost my interest. I had been very excited; the books made some of my fondest childhood memories. Very little of the spirit I remembered came through, and the redolence of forgotten tv gave me such a sinking feeling, I thought I must have remembered incorrectly. This production might mean well, but it's on a different page. The source was not drivel."
1,Puh--leez,"One of my favorite books of all time was ""Wizard of Earthsea"". I tried to be non-judgemental because I know they ALWAYS change things in the screen adaptations, but why, why, why, for heaven's sake, did they have to make this look like a cheesy rip-off from LOTR and Harry Potter? Le Guin wrote this book way before Harry Potter. Just, well, read the book. Much better."
1,Le Guin fans will be disappointed,"Don't waste your money!If you are a fan of the Earthsea series of books, you will be sorely disappointed in this miniseries. I was so disappointed, I couldn't even finish watching it when it was originally aired on the SciFi Channel! The acting was poor and the dialogue was contrived. It had none of the sublime spiritual beauty of Le Guin's text, and the inner lives and struggles of the characters were not as clearly portrayed. In all, I found it to be juvenile and superficial. There is absolutely nothing of the spirit of the books in this miniseries!Apparently, people who have not read the books have enjoyed this miniseries. I tried to imagine what I would think of it if I had not read the books, and could only conclude that maybe I would have liked it if I had seen it during middle school or earlier. In otherwords, adult fans of fantasy: don't waste your money."
2,Best to dissociate it completely from the books,"This film version of the classic Earthsea books bears almost no resemblance to them whatsoever - even the names of the characters were reversed. If you loved the books you will most likely hate this movie.As a work of art, the film is not bad, I suppose. The visual effects are decent and the sets are pretty good, but the acting is mediocre. Overall the film is underwhelming compared to other recent fantasy adaptations."
4,It's a paper towel holder. No need to get so excited about it.,It's marble. It's stiff. It assembled in seconds.
3,Adorable,"I got this for my one year old Pomeranian. He immediately befriended it and plays with it often. He tore some of the filling out within five minutes, so perhaps it could be constructed a little better. It arrived on time and was packaged well. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase."
5,Daughter loves it!,"My 9-year-old daughter bought this pup with her own money and she is very happy with the purchase. Good quality and looks life-like. She was a little smaller than expected, but still impressed."
1,Mis-fire movie script,"Let me begin by saying I like this author's prose.His voice is accessible, upbeat and fun, and he knows a great deal aboutNative Americans, being one himself.That said, I found this screenplay diffuse and slack.Couldn't get with the characters or situationand put the book aside halfway through.I can recommend his book of short stories, War Dances.John Meyer, NYC"
3,A good introduction to Viking religion,This book is an excellent introduction to Viking religion and well-researched. The author avoids New Age interpretations and sticks to the facts. It tends to drag a little sometimes.
1,annoying lesbo rock,"This album is incredibly annoying. I imagine overweight short- haired ""raver"" looking ""grrrls"" dancing around dormrooms at Evergreen/Sarah Lawrence/Antioch etc. At this party are always several emasculated thick black glasses skinny pants ""rocker"" boys. If the aformentioned party sounds enticing, then look no further--this is the album for you. Fans of Huggy Bear, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, the Butchies--you will enjoy this hackneyed nonsense."
3,Not as impressed as others,I did not get as good a feed back from this product as I had hoped. I used it a few time and then sold it.
3,Swingyde,"I found the Swingyde to be an effective training aid, especially as it pertains to the swing plane and the follow-through. I used it with a six-iron and enjoyed hitting balls with it. But changing the Swingyde to another club was a bit cumbersome. I did not care to use the Swingyde with the rubberband as I found it a bit too confining and snug. My rating is due to the two negatives I have stated, eventhough I feel that it is effective and helpful in reinforcing the swing plane and encouraging a good follow-through."
2,Don't Bother,Received on time - but this is a total waste of money - don't even bother - I would recommend taking a few lessons before buying this.
5,Back at their best,it took 3 years for this album to finished and released and during that time had no idea what it would sound but i can now say its better than i ever imagined.Right thru from Sunrise to still breathing pure duran duran at their besti love all the songs but to pick a few of my highlights want you more and nice they get you up dancing as soon as they starts. chains and still breathing are amazing listen to simon singing those lyrics are amazing.You hear all five of duran duran influences on this album. brilliant!I wouldn't really compare this to rio as they were done so many years apart but Astronaut is fast becoming my fav album. Highly recommend for duranies (like myself) and non duranies.
2,Recipes are a bust so far...,"While I must agree with all the reviews before me about the binding, photos, history, symbols, etc... I cannot agree with those who actually reviewed the recipes and products made from this book. I am not a novice baker, so I feel I can point some of the blame on the recipes when the finished product doesn't turn out as advertised. Maybe one recipe isn't the best - okay I get it. Perhaps this amount was a typo - I get that, too (though you'd think cookbooks would be extra careful on the typo-front!). But so far three for three of the cookies made in this book have somehow NOT worked out as advertised. Either a crumb or a crust didn't come together during cooking, or in one case the balled cookies melted into one giant puddle on the pan! So far NOT impressed... even the binding and pretty pictures can't help a book if the content isn't tested - or even properly edited. So watch out when buying this book, or just go buy a different one."
4,Sólo para fanáticos de Celine Dion,Si eres fan de Celine Dion no debes dejar de tener esto en tu colección!!
5,The Predecessor of this drill was used by NASA in outer spa,"I have had the older 12V Panasonic drill for five years now and can't live without it. It is light so that you can use it all day and yet powerful enough to snap #8 x 3"" screw heads off if you don't pre drill the holes. The 45 minute charger is a real blessing too, because no mater how hard you work the drill, the recharger has a battery ready way before you need it."
1,Sucks,I have only had this unit for less then 5 months....and it no longer works. What else can I say. DO NOT BUY.
5,"""Do You Want To Be More Successful""?","What do you suppose this book is about? If you guessed body language, hand shakes, eye movements, etc., you are correct. This book captures your interest and moves you to read the next page. Would you like to be able to tell if another person likes you in a matter of seconds? Wouldn't it be exciting to know that you could have the job you wanted, just by using body language? Read this book, see what I'm talking about."
3,"Not bad, but definitely not great.","First off, there is no ICP, or any Psychopathic Records' bands, music in this documentary. No live footage either, just a bunch of pictures of them live. The documentary isn't much of a documentary. More of an interview video. They do have a cool, but DATED, interview with ICP about getting dropped by Disney. This was from 1998, back when J and Shaggy had dreads still. Then they don't interview anyone from the Psychopathic camp at all. They interview Missy from B.M.H., Big Flame from JCW, The guy who owns Rock of Ages music store, and several music critics, but noone in any Psychopathic bands or anyone who works with ICP. No kind of real insight or background information about the band really. Just general stuff you probably already knew anyway."
3,"It's an OK icp video, but nothin worth going psycho over","This isn't a documentary. It just goes over how ICp First came on the scene with there early days as Inner City Posse, It also explains the whole faygo thing, and How Disney cheated them over. Its only 45 minutes long, so as you expect its nothing GREAT. But its still an ok video, but i would recommend purchasing it only if you are a true ICP fan."
3,My son loves this video!,"I agree that the content isn't age appropriate (my son was 15 months old when I bought this video); however, he LOVES this show! He loves all Baby Einstein videos - mostly for the puppets and other children in them. Anyway, I didn't buy this for him to learn sign language, I bought this for the puppet shows and it was worth it!If you want a sign language video, we have the Baby Signing Time videos and they are WONDERFUL! They are even fun for the parents and we both know so many signs now."
3,Not as good as other signing videos,"I've always loved Baby Einstein videos for my kids, so I was thrilled to find a BE signing vid. But this was pretty poorly considered. The words they teach baby to sign are ridiculous. What baby needs to know Salon, or Bank? Babies need useful signs for what's around them. Playground is a word they teach, but it's a complicated two-step sign that a kid would need to be two or older to accomplish. By then, the child would be able to say the word easier! If you're looking for a video to teach babies sign language I strongly recommend looking elsewhere."

5,GREAT BIRKENSTOCKS,These are the support your feet could be crying out for. If your feet ache or you suffer from plantar fasicitis the could relieve the pain. I wear them 24/7. Even as a house shoe.
2,it gets the job done.,This is very hard shoe. It is almost like a wooden Dutch clog. But it has the comfortable Birkenstock footbed and provides foot coverage although i would have and should have gone with the suade...
5,birkenstock,"i have been wearing birks for 20+ years and these are great fall fall , very comfortable shoes. great price to."
4,"The resaw seems uderpowered at time, but overall a fine saw","I have owned the resaw for six months now. I have used the saw to resaw maple and birch. The saw cuts the 8"" plus wood nicely. I knew the motor was underpowered when I bought the saw. My shop is a one man shop, with not many time restraints, so not to big a problem for me. The motor never stalls and the resaw runs smoothly"
4,Groundup,"I have an older Hitachi that I love, unfortunately I must part with it due to shop space. Since Amazon is out of stock....anyone interested? Contact Rick at Groundupdev@hotmail.com"
5,Great overall workout!,"This is a good workout for you entire body,I love pilates they help you to feel relaxed,and not stressed when your done with your workout,and that is what this dvd does,yet I know this will help me get even more toned,Moira is a great instructor,with a nice soothing voice,You will love this dvd!"
1,Assassins Creed,This movie could have been better if it had more time to it. I wouldn't waste money on buying it unless you are into short films
4,Don't believe everything you read.,"I almost didn't purchase this unit after reading a number of negative reviews, where others told how their recorders refused to work.I bought mine to record classes at guitar camp recently. It worked just as advertised. I imported the sound files into Audacity to make them louder and to improve the fidelity, as the levels were very low.I have not tried recording through the line input yet, but based on the internal microphone, for memo recording, I would recommend this product."
1,NOT GOOD,"THIS MIC WILL NOT WORK OVER HALF THE TIME, WASTE OF TIME, THERE IS NO WAY YOU CANTELL IF IT IS WORKING UNTILL YOU ARE DONE."
2,Good Until It Stops Working ...,"This product served its purpose effectively (Recording piano accompaniment and occasionally vocals) until it mysteriously stopped working after a year. I would attach the microphone and it wouldn't register that it was attached. If I held the microphone in sometimes it would register. When I tried recording a few songs, it said it was recording, but nothing played back when I listened to them."
2,Optimism quashed,"I bought this device hoping to use my new 5th gen ipod video as a digital recorder for class lectures but felt it did not meet my expectations. The Apple genius person told me, after making ""voice memos"" that were not able to be transferred to the computer and were part dead air, that memos could not be recorded longer than 20 minutes or the file would start to corrupt. So I began to stop the recordings at or before 20 minutes and I still had problems with about 30% of the files being partly corrupted and most unable to be transferred to my computer. My second trip to the genius bar was met with rebuff and advice to buy a real digital recorder and just use my iPod for music. I try to be a good apple customer....but its so hard sometimes.... I was also directed to the ExtremeMac company. I'll enquire there too...but not with much optimism. I think the advice I got today is best...buy a recorder."
4,Energizing... Different... Worth it!,"I bought this album my first day visiting Bahia, Brasil (hopefully won't be my last; I loved it!) and I'm glad I did. It is catchy and because it is a compilation, you get to hear different artists' styles, and determine what you like. It is in portuguese, so if you don't speak it, but being able to understand what they are saying is important to you, this album is NOT for you. You can hear the black american influence, but it is not just a copy of american hip hop w/portuguese lyrics. There is some brazil flava to it. Try it!"
1,what a shame,"It's a shame that this is one of the few recordings of the Liebermann Sonata available. Katherine Kemler's rendition of the Muczynski sonata isn't too bad, but her Liebermann has some serious problems with it. Wrong notes are abundant, and the execution of the piece is just very sloppy in general (particularly in the second movement). I'm not particulary impressed with her use of vibrato or choice of phrasing either, although perhaps this is a matter of taste. But in an edited recording there's really no excuse for so many blatant errors. The Liebermann Sonata is a good piece, and it deserves better."
5,Another Naxos bargain,"I agree with the previous reviewer, these are great performances of great pieces, for a laughable price. All the earlier works, Sonata no. 2, no. 5 (his most frequently recorded), plus the Fantasy in B, display Scriabin's usual refined brilliance, and some Chopin influences in the Fantasy's case. The Sonata 2 must surely be as close to a perfect romatic sonata as any composer has come, with the moonlight in the first movement and the turbulent sea in the second. Sonata 5 evokes some of the same moods as the 2nd with further integration of Scriabin's unique harmonic language. As for the later sonatas, 6, 7, and 9, they seem well written but are a little too heavily steeped in Scriabin's ""mystic chord"" harmonies for my preference, they may be an acquired taste. However, they are still worth listening to, with the almost jazz-like qualities of the 7th. At any rate, the performances are all very good. You can escape to another world with this CD!"
5,Toro Rain Sensor,"Toro Wired Rain Sensor #53769Great product... easy to install. Works on either a ""closed circuit"" or ""open circuit"" irrigation station."
3,govideo R6640,"Working fine most of the time,sometimes unit freezes,have to unplug it to get disk out."
1,Do not buy!!!,"I purchased this recorder and was pleased with it until it froze while I was recording. The only way to unfreeze it was to unplug the unit. When you do this, you lose everything you previously recorded. I returned the unit and got a replacement (refurbished unit I found out later). After a week, the same thing happened again. I returned and received 2 more units. The last unit I asked for a brand new one, but who knows if it really was. Even this one did the same thing. I can't tell you how much material I have permanently lost because of this recorder. Stay away from this unit and anything else GoVideo puts out there or you'll be sorry. One more thing if you do buy this unit, make sure you return it within 30 days of purchasing when you have problems, and you will have them. If after 30 days, GoVideo will make you pay $79 for a replacement and it's a refurbished machine."
2,NOT IN YOUR CAR,"The sound quality is bad, don't get me wrong it does the job, but previously I owned a road trip and used it with my Ipod. The roadtrip is powerful in the sense that it blocks out whatever radio signal you have on and you can play your music, the mmr-60 is very weak and for it to do the job you have find a good spot in your car and somehow keep it there, but still the sound quality is pretty bad. This device I wanted it for my car and it did not do well, it does the job at home so that is why I kept 2 stars."
2,Don't waste your money unless you planned to use it outside the city,"This thing works good but only very close to the receiver, and don't even try to use it in the car unless you can make it levitate just above the radio, it won't work even from the passenger seat. It's good for use it in the country thou, place you're phone over the radio and then it works good."
1,"Yes, it really is THAT BAD.","I saw the reviews for this product that said that the reception and sound quality were poor, but I also saw other reviews that indicated it might be okay. So, I decided to take a chance on it, just to see what my experience would be.The MMR-60 is worthless -- the signal was so weak as to be, well, unlistenable.I spent an hour or so trying different radio settings and finally decided it wasa lost cause.Save yourself some money and time, don't bother with this product."
1,This Item SUCKS!,Very expensive price for a piece of crap! the worst thing Sony has ever manufatured.
2,"Works, but should be much better","Many of the negative comments about the MMR-60 FM Transmitter are valid points. However, understanding its limitations will help to mitigate some of them. Here are some tips to get passable sound.(1) Place the transmitter in a location as close to the receiver's antenna as possible and with as few obstructions as possible. (2) Choose an unused frequency that is between two other unused frequencies. (3) Turn the volume of the phone all the way up and set the equalizer to flat.I mainly use mine in the car and the best locations I've found is on the sun visor or propped up in the center console (my antenna is printed on the back window). Keep in mind that orientation also plays a factor in the signal strength, so if the signal is weak, try moving the transmitter around slightly. The sound may not be the best, but if your radio doesn't have an input jack like mine, the options are extremely limited."
5,"LIghtnin' Hopkins in a ""Band"" Format","This CD is more or less a reissue of the 1965 LP, ""Lightnin' Strikes"" (Tradition 2103), which I've played enough to create some signs of wear. Finding the CD will take some of the stress off the LP.According to the liner notes of the LP, it was recorded on Oct 4-5, 1965 in Los Angeles by producer Davis Hubert. The original cuts from the LP (CD tracks 3 - 11) place Lightnin' in a band setting with bass (Jimmy Bond), drums (Earl Palmer), and harmonica (Don Crawford) added to Hopkins' guitar and vocals. Though less traditional for Lightnin' Hopkins than some might prefer, these cuts are among my favorite of Hopkins'. The other six tracks are mostly Lightnin' in the more traditional ""solo"" mode.I've looked on and off for years for a reissue on CD of ""Lightnin' Strikes"" and was most grateful to find this."
5,Rarely is there a book as good as this one!,"Meryl Sawyer's TEMPTING FATE is one of the best books I have ever read. Logan McCord is a wonderfully scarred and tortured hero. His kidnapping experience seems to have scarred him permanatly, such as his distaste of kissing. Kelly Taylor is a wonderful young woman and neither Logan or Kelly seem to quite understand the other. There are some misunderstandings between the two. There are many questions the reader may form at the beginning of this book such as...Who kidnapped Logan? What were their reasons? Maybe the kidnapper is closer to home than anyone thinks. Why does Logan barely remember his first five years before his kidnapping? Why does he look so much like his ""adoptive"" father? Why do his supposed siblings resent his return? Don't worry. Meryl Sawyer will answer these questions and more. The answers may surprise you."
5,I loved it,"This was Romantic Suspense at its best. Great hero, great heroine and a wonderful story rich with details. The chemistry was good too. I would have liked a little more sizzle but its the type of story that grabs you and holds on."
1,Dogs won't chew it,"Big dogs, love bones but won't touch this thing. Not sure if it's bad or what but it is not a hit and not worth it. They love the stuffed bones but not this thing. Strange would have thought this would have been a huge hit."
5,Bigger than i expected,This bone was a bit bigger than we expected it to be and our dog loves it. Make sure and open it up outside!
5,Most realistic racing simulator ever,"Papyrus' Nascar 2003 racing season simracing game is the most realistic racing simulator ever devised. Played by real life drivers like Dale Earnhardt Jr, AJ Almendinger, and other big name Nascar drivers, it is perfect for the casual racer or the hardcore league racer. Even at over 6 years old, the game runs and looks good on current computer hardware and delivers an ultra realistic, fun and addictive racing experience."
4,Celebrate Indeed,I have had this for a few years. This group is another group who kicked asphalt. There are some artists who just know how to jam.Not one song stink no not one. Get a copy and enjoy you will not be disappointed.
3,great songs- bad sound,I really wanted to hear these songs with great or even really good fidelity- but alas it sounds slightly better then the one speaker phonograph I had as a teenageer- I still enjoyed it after a few songs got used to the bad sound (compared to most any other cd I have) but was disappointed it didnt sound as good as contemporaries such as the BREAD anthoogy which has great sound. _Perhaps no good master tapes exsist? the reviews iVE READ FOR THE JOY TO THE WORLD ANATHOLOGY SAID THE SAME THING- BUT THAT ONE LEAVES OFF MAMA told me not to come
1,Fatwa!,"You sent me the wrong move! I had ordered a Batman movie, Since you change my order, I don""t remenber which one.."
4,great secret message toy,"My son is 6 and has had a lot of fun writing secret messages with friends and then seeing them in the dark with the pen. They do not use the paper hidden within the pen, but enjoy it none the less."
5,Uber Impressed,"I saw these guys perform a few weeks after they signed on to Hollywood. I was immediately drawn into their performance by the poetic lyrics and catchy guitar skills. I remembering thinking... ""Wow..this is just good, old rock."" It was so soothing and invigorating! After they performed ""Almost Perfect"", I decided I was going to buy the cd. And I have not been disappointed. Neither will you. If you still have doubts, you can preview all the songs at www.ingramhillmusic.com . The boys from Memphis can rock!"
4,hot Hot HOT!,"I am so impressed with Ingram Hill. I first saw them as the opening act for Hanson, and I imdiatly fell in love. I bought the cd, and let me tell you. It rocks. Plain and simple, it ROCKS."
1,Wow Surprisingly Bad,"OK Rita has some wonderful songs but barely enough to fill out 2 CDs. So leaving off 2 of her best songs -- Words and I Don't Want To Talk About is a crime!! Who is the idiot who puts together these things anyway? Many very very mediocre songs -- Basic Lady, Cherokee???? Just AWFUl!!! -- so disappointing!!!!!!!! She deserves better."
3,REALLY SCARY book,"I spent more than 7 hours reading this book and to be honest it really scared me. There was new twists and turns about the killer and what she was doing. I would give it a 5 if I liked the author's sick sense of killing humor (I don't think the nature of the killings were appealing in any sense). But if you are looking for a book to scare you and keep you up wondering who is next on the killer's list, then this book is for you."
4,"Great for computers over 17""","My computer is 17.3"" and also very thick it is hard to find 17.3"" backpacks that are also thick enough. This is a great backpack and it fit the computer perfectly!"
5,"Serendipity, pure and simple.","I waited until the longer version of ""It's A Long Way There"" was available and at 8:39 of pure joy it was well worth the wait. I had one or more LP's way back when (those were plastic things that warped if you left them in the car). How they ever got away from my collection is beyond me. Now they are back and I am all the more happy for it. Other reviewers have made note of several other of their wonderful songs so I'll mention one of my favorites, ""The Night Owls"" - very enjoyable for it's highly danceable beat. Do a slow EC swing, or fast WC, or Samba or even Cha your heart out and know the joy these guys can transmit. Serendipity, pure and simple."
1,Spent $1800 bucks - only lasted 1.5 years,"We bought this HDTV only to have it break after just a year and a half! It had some minor problems with the video output during that year and a half, but yesterday we were watching it and it suddenly started smoking and the screen went black. It only has a one year warranty. We tried calling Phillips tech support. They couldn't tell us what happened, how to fix it, what the 4 blinking red lights meant or any sort of helpful information!After looking around online we have found MANY people that have had the same problem with this TV. This will be the LAST Phillips product we ever buy!Do NOT waste your money on this TV!"
3,Candlestick,"Misinterpreted the product description as an electric candlestick. It is not. It is a candlestick, without a candle. As far as the candlestick itself, it is very nice and does look exactly as it is pictured."
2,Directions Confusing...,"I bought this book thinking that I was getting a steal with all these great purse patterns for a low cost. I am making a bag from this, the Slouchy Knitting Bag and everything went wrong from the beginning. The author does not clarify what directions to look at or which pieces to use, leaving the sewer confused and annoyed at the time and effort put into something and have their fabric wasted. If you like being confused, this is definitely the book for you. You would probably be better off if you just used a pattern."
5,"Yes, yes indeed","i would just like to state another opinion of the same demeanor as the reviews above--this album is beautiful. today, i was walking in the local used cd store (used kids), and came upon this album all shiny in it's plastic but with a sticker tag of only three dollars. not knowing who jeff klein was, i picked it up...what a find. to whomever sold back this cd, thank you for the gift, it is truly appreciated."
5,Genius with a capital G,"Album of the decade. That's my opinion of Mellow gold. It's a record that is had to listen more than once to like it. But when i passed that stage it just got better and better. The sounds, the lyrics, the humor, the variation, it just keeps great, even four years after release. Pay no mind and Steal my body home are my favourites, but the rest of tracks are also great without exception. Well Sweet Sunshine is the one i like a bit less, but it's stil fcking cool. This man is a Genius, and I will keep listening to Mellow Gold for years and years!"
4,My least favorite Beck album,"Mellow Gold is known primarily for containing the single that propelled Beck into superstardom, Loser. And while that is a great song, as is Beercan, and the rest of the album is a nice collection of Beck's bizarre songcraft when he was young and trying to break on through, it's my least favorite of his albums simply because it all seems a little half-assed. Maybe that's just my opinion. While I do pull it out to listen to every once and a while and enjoy it when I do, it's the one album of his I listen to the least. I find it surprising some of the reviews on here calling it his best album, but that's the beauty of these reviews. Every opinion is different, but mine is that it's his weakest album."
5,Great First Record,Every track on this record is great. There have been times in the last 14 years when I have listened to this record every time I am in the car for a week or two straight. You think the record is really good and then Beercan comes on more than halfway through and you realize this record is GREAT! If you have never listened to Beck start w/ this. If you like it keep going.
4,Hons and Daughters and Rebels,"I was looking for a Jessica Mitford autobiography and discovered ""Hons & Rebels"". The original title of this (1960) book is Daughters & Rebels"". Is anything other than the title revised/updated? I'm such a fan of Mitford, I'd rather read her memoirs than Mary S. Lovell's ""The Sisters: The Saga of the Mitford Family"", which is supposedly more detailed."
5,A book about your favirote Prairy Girl in Love,Laura Ingalls is finally abel to teach school. She teaches in a school 12 miles from home.

Almanzo risks his life so could he be in love with her?Follow thier steps as Almanzo Wilder courts Laura.
1,Carbide PLEASE!,"I am very glad I bought carbide blades when I bought this unit, since they seem impossible to find now. I have had a notify request in to Amazon/ToolCrib for over a year, never got any information, and they long ago seem to have removed the carbide blade item from the site. This unit NEEDS carbide blades for the planer. Without them, the unit is relatively useless on anything harder than fresh yellow pine. Old wood, ash, oak and the like require carbide or this machine simply folds the edge of the steel knives. while they can be resharpened, they are relatively useless compared to carbide blades. The planer is great, the steel blades are a waste of time."
3,bad audio,"for someone like me who has replaced all music with Jrock/Jmetal and so on, this CD is great for those people that want to hear stuff that sounds ""westernized""that said. the audio quality sounds like the CD was recorded in half audio, so if im listening to other bands the second one of these comes on it sounds like someone just killed the volume.i have no problem with the songs themselves tho."
4,Nice supplement to party charades,"I purchased this game as a way of providing an option for people at parties where charades is being played and the people involved do not want to make up their own things to act out. As such we only use the cards, not the board, and use of the cards is optional. It obviously gives a lot more ideas than we could think of ourselves when playing charades, so it fills that bill nicely. Charades has always been a big hit at parties which I have attended, and having the actual 'game' is a big help."
1,Not So Great,This was not the easiest to play and wasnt user friendly for all ages.Amazon's customer service was outstanding in the return of this product for full credit.
4,"I enjoyed it, but it became tedious at the end.`","I liked the beginning, and I was actually excited to read it at points. It was quite interesting, but after a while it had a few too many people coming out, and although it did get its point across, it started to get boring. I did like the way it ended, though it was fairly predictable, Everyone in the story was going to be gay at some point."
2,Not the best guide,"I used this book while in Africa, and discovered that Africans were using a guide to the mammals of Africa that is better organized and easier to use. I'm still trying to find that other book - difficult when I don't know the authors."
2,Eyes of a stranger,"I actually only bought this dvd because Im a huge Macgyver fan. This was RDA's post Macgyver film. I paid a buck for it off here and it's all it's worth.I fell asleep half way though as it's a boring. Bascially Macgyver has to babysit justine bateman and starts to fall in love with her, and he gets shot in the process, movie over.It's plot is pretty typical and boring, I was expecting Dana Elcar to pop up and pull Mac outta a jam... but was disapointed."
1,NOT COMPARABLE TO PINK MARTINI,"I purchased this CD based on the reviews - ""if you like Pink Martini..."" I love Pink Martini, I love Latin music, but I dont love this. The instumentals are great, if only you could separate the ridiculously stupid lyrics. One review compared Pepe to Ricky Ricardo - true but more aptly a bad attempt at satire, reminiscent of an SNL sketch. I only wish I purchased this at Tower or Virgin so I could return it - I cant think of anyone to give it to. It's so bad I'd be embassased to be associated with it. To each their own. People are entitled to their opinion and to love this CD. However, dont compare it to another band knowing that people will rely on your comments."
3,Auto-trim hit-or-miss,"I put these tuners on an Epiphone Dot. They seem to maintain the guitar in tune just fine, but the auto-trim feature does not work on all the strings, I had to manually clip the E and the A strings of a Fender NPS 10 - 46 set. Great when it works though."
4,"Very good, designed for 8' and 10' closets","This is a great, and great looking system. All of the layouts that are in the instructions are for 8' and 10' closets. Most of the long parts are 6'. My closet is 5'6"" and I made it work well, but it did take some adjusting. I thought I could just take an 8' configuration, and omit the 2' of shelving on the right...that mostly worked. I ran into a couple of issues with where some support parts landed and also with where I had to cut the long shelf and the gap left by a slat that I had to remove rather than cut in half (in the end I put the slat back in butted up to another slat - no gap - to take care of the issue).Anyway, long and short of it is that this is a good system but it can take some time to customize if you aren't installing in an 8' or 10' closet."
5,Well worth it!!,This closet system was very versatile and although time consuming basically easy to configure. We opted for a symmetrical layout and have a power saw and drill so we were able to easily cut and bolt the pieces to our liking. The end result is a very stylish organized closet with ample space.
4,Delighted,"It was a little more difficult than I imagined it would be to put together, but once up it was absolutely beautiful. I am concerned about the hangers sliding on wood; worried it may become dull and scratched over time."
1,Extremely difficult to install,"This item is extremely difficult to install, it took us 3 days. It also scratches VERY easily. I would never purchase this brand again, and do not recommend it."
5,Closet Organizer,"The product was delivered faster than suggested. I have an old house with old plaster walls, so I paid a carpenter to install the unit. It was an all day project. The instructions were very easy to follow, and there were ample parts to complete it. The quality is great, and I LOVE the finished product! I was able to turn a small spare bedroom into a walk-in closet!"
3,copy controll disaster,This is not the best Tom Jones record ever made but it could be listenable if it didn't contain copy control. I tried to listen it in my pc. It copied some kind of program to hard disk and then a very poor quality sound was coming out stopping now and then. I was advised that it is not possible to get an ordinary good cd sound because of this control system.The disk contains the material twice: good sound for cd players and a poor one for pcs. It doesn't play in every player (many carplayers or walkmans don't play it at all).
4,Much better than many expect from him,"I really don't understand why this guy is so panned by the critics. Maybe it is some kind of envy that he looks so and sings so at his age?Anyway, this album is vintage Tom Jones, with a touch of the new millenium. He manages to stay what he always have been in all those years, and at the same time he modernizes his music.The first single Tom Jones International is one of the best his songs ever, although I thing that Holiday will be biggest hit in the charts.Don't believe to all those snobbish little reviews (it comes to mind that one in Q magazine), go and buy this CD and you will be satisfied."
4,Still Valid (and Funky),"On this CD, Tom proves once again that he's not just some Las Vegas has-been livin' off the oldies. Maybe I have bizarre tastes in music, but I'm a big fan of both Tom Jones and Wyclef Jean. The combination of the two is a little freaky, but a hell of a lot of fun! The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that there are a couple of cuts that I don't like (like with most CDs I buy). For the most part, T.J.'s experimentation and collaborations in the past few years have been great - (check out ""The Lead and How To Swing It"" and ""Reload""). Now I'm just waitin' for him to hook up with George Clinton (another thoroughly hip old SOB)..."
2,"Good music, but ...","The music is very good - robust, hearty, well done. The two stars are for the recording of the music - long lapses between the ending of one piece and the beginning of the next, making one wonder if there even is a next. The sound is uneven. I purchased this cd used, glad I didn't pay full price for it."
2,plain pornography,"I enjoyed the historical background, and the exposition of the customs of the time, especially in regard to the haughty English presence in India. The plot was good, but could have had an extraordinary potential. I was dissapointed that the setting was not more fully developed with more complete descriptions, as well as the characters themselves. In reference to the sexual content of the book, there is a clear distinction between an ""erotic"" novel and plain pornography. In this respect, much could have been left out, especially the redundant passages, and the step-by-step sexual action."
4,Generally a good book.,"1st of all, the content of the book is old. The book is written based on a collection of works and papers written before 1960, so if you are looking for the recent developments in mechanics of impact behavior, this is not the book.Advantages:1. Gives a good idea, introduction, and explaination about the models and theories of impact , contact phenomena, and wave propagation.2. It contains many comparisons with experimental data, and also it contains a whole chapter about results of impact experiments.3. No unnecessary stuff (i.e. it is ""generally"" simple, and direct).Disadvantages:1. It is an old content book.2. Needs some knowledge of advance calculus and partial differential equations.So I dont recomand this book for undergraduate students, but i think it is useful for graduate students and researchers."
4,It was good,No problems. I didn't wind up keeping it because I didn't really care for the format but that's not anyone's fault I just didn't care for the book lol
4,Pockets galore,"Pro: Great design, lots of pockets, excellent qualityCon: very large in size, inviting to add more and more making it very heavy"
5,The Original Persuaders,"I love The Persuaders. Unfortunately Tommy Hill passed, but The Persuaders legend can be seen on their official website; www.thepersuadersonline.com with the Living Legend/singer/song writer/producer/ Richard Poindexter, Alexander Brown, David Turner, and Carlos Flores (replacing Tommy Hill).. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to know you. PJ"
1,typical bad parenting sitcom.,"1. the family has no religious grounding.2. telling a child masturbation is ok (points to number 1.) or part of growing up, this is just immoral, bad parenting. this is the sin of lust.3. condom use and it is normal? how about making a show that is in opposition to secular culture instead of bathing in the immoral culture around us.4. I now have an idea how evil the writers/producers/actors are this show absolutely sucks, terrible example of humanity."
1,Ugh!,"Overacting at its finest! This show is supposedly about parenthood, but it shows the worst parenting that ever lived. Nothing like saying in front of your child ""How am I supposed to handle him?"" Should be a lesson on how not to parent. The director needs to tone down the horrible overacting especially by the parents of the autistic Max, and get some new writers who know what parents should say to their children."
3,"Good show about family, too many sketch problems.","I love how they have many real life moments. The sense of family and looking out for each other is portrayed well. There is though almost too much drama, plot lines of the negative not positive nature. Way too much sex outside of marriage."
2,Very Disappointed ! :(,I gave this as a gift and just received a call from my niece and her husband saying they were trying to watch the shows and it was skipping so bad they could not see it. This is very disappointing as it was something they were looking forward to getting. I am going to order them another one and hope it is better. Because they live out of town I am not able to get the damaged one back from them to return. This is now going to cost me twice as much as it should have.
2,Nice until it burned out.,"I used it a minute here, a minute there for a total of no more than 20 minutes and the brush terminal wire connection burnt out. I've owned it for over a year and the warranty is expired. Worked well until then."
5,Lovely.,"Received my blanket today. This is for my 2 year olds bed - she needed an additional blanket for her bed.#1: It is uber soft. So so nice.#2: It's medium weight. Not to light or too heavy. As my daughter will be using this as an additional blanket for the winter, I already think it will be a great primary one for the summer when we have the a/c on.#3: It's slightly larger than an average twin sized blanket, somewhere between a twin and a full. A plus in my book.#4: Did I mention how soft it is?I'll be watching for deals on the other sizes for the rest of the beds in my house."
2,Under wrong listing,"I wanted to order an electric blanket for my niece for Christmas, so I went to Amazon and typed in 'electric blanket' and this blanket popped up and was right within my price range.So I ordered it. When it came, it was not electric. Once again I typed in 'electric blanket' and this one popped up again.I know this is my fault for not reading the description more carefully, but I guess since it was under the electric blanket listing, I just assumed. So, I had to spend $9.00 to send back a $20.00 blanket."
4,Tantus,"If you are looking to almost completely silence your sub, this ball gag is not the one to do it with. I had purchased a ball gag from a novelty shop that I had a reaction to (before buying this one), and the only good thing that that gag had over this one was that it kept me completely silent. Tantus gag will still allow you to form words and pretty complete sentences instead of a nonsensical and muffled ""mmhnnnmmggg"" that a real ball gag will grant you.The material, though, is soft and extremely easy to clean and feels great in my mouth."
3,just ok,I wasn't thrilled with this gag. Perhaps I have a small mouth but it's just too big to fit the entire thing comfortably in my mouth. I prefer the traditional ball
3,"good picture, annoying remote","I don't know if this problem is unique to the set that I have, but the remote simply does not work unless it is pointed directly at the green light on the bottom left part of the TV. Even when the remoted is pointed directly at the receiver, it lags enough for me to press the button one too many times. It is getting very tiresome.I also have problems with the TV losing some of the programmed channels. One minute the channel is available, but after changing over to another channel, the previous channel is gone. It sometimes comes back in a matter of minutes, other times, in several hours, sometimes never.Other than that, I think everyone will agree that the picture quality is very good. The black levels are acceptable, but it can get a bit hard to see dark features on screen when the room light is dimmed."
1,Does not fit,The product did not fit on my C10FCH2 Miter Saw with Laser...the extension wings are not wide enough to fit in the holes. There are no apparent problems with the product other than the fact that I can't use it with my saw.
4,A nice quality product at a great price,"This was a bit lighter material than I was expecting, but it is a great shirt for the price. I am very pleased with it, and the Amazon price could not be beat."
2,Not the best...,My husband likes a tighter neck and this was quite loose. Also the ones I got were very lightweight by comparison to onehe already had which was quite heavy and the neck was snugger.
3,I have some old Russell athletic shirts. That was the reason I bought these,Not happy with the thickness ... Used to be more beefed up. Grayish blue shirt was itchy even after washing. The grey's usually have some other material in them??
1,Not what advertised.,"I thought I was ordering a poly/cotton blend and it's not. It is a 100% cotton, thinly made, very short t-shirt."
2,Itchy and scratchy,"Having purchased both, it is well worth the extra five dollars or so for the cotton performance tee. The performance tee is soft and comfortable. The basic tee is unpleasant."
5,t shitrt for rls,just what he needed Hard to find in the store liked the color and fabric will beed more later share this with others
2,Does not wash well,"I wash all of our clothes in cold water to avoid shrinkage, but after a few washes this shirt lost a couple of inches and looks ridiculous."
3,it`s ok,"expected to have higher quality fabric, I'm not entirely happy helps me to stop what I need.although it is one hundred percent cotton, high quality is not"
2,not too good,"these tee shirts just don't seem the same quality as the Russell tees you buy at Sears, etc. I bought them here because I am 6'3 and it is hard to find the tall ones in the stores. These are too long - down below your butt. And the necks feel too tight. I wouldn't buy again."
2,so so,The shirt is ok for the price. I would not purchase it as a great quality shirt! So that is what you are looking for don't hesitate in purchasing it!
4,Godflesh's Album Notes,: I Started Recording This Album In May 1987 With GODFLESH Recorded In January 1988.
3,not a bad toy for its purpose,"I purchased the toddler play all day toy from Amazon for my two twin daughters who are 3 years of age. The item had some assembly required-it wasn't to difficult to put together during the holiday crunch. I did have some disappointment with the quality. The slide doesn't stay on the piece as well as the other parts that attach do. The cardboard elements were very weak comparatively and therefore were easy to bend in the installation and it would have been nice if they were covered with a protective material since one of the items in the piece is a dry erase marker and of course it was used to color the pictures. Other than that, the girls have enjoyed having the little extra for their toddler doll to play with. Not a bad piece for its purpose."
3,"Good value and fun, but falls apart","My daughter enjoys playing with this and her Little Mommy Toddler doll, but the slide keeps falling off and the entire set will fall over pretty easily. Still, it's a pretty decent toy"
2,If you must,"My daughter had to have this play set to go with the toddler doll (they are advertised in the same commercial). It is cumbersome, clumsy and difficult to play with. It requires more assembly than I would have liked and more space for play that it seems. It is just an awkward toy."
4,Coul dbe a lot of fun,"While the way the product interacts with the doll, it is nearly impossible to keep together. The slide doesn't stay securely in place and the ""pictures"" dont stay where they belong, which lead me to just remove them completely. My kids prefer to play with it as a ""drive in"" window, or a fort wall."
1,Applewel Therapeutics,"Applewel Therapeutics has a face and body mist that I think works much better. I use it after bathing, sun exposure, or mainly after shaving. I shave my head so I really need a product to help with skin irritation."
2,Whatever,"If you did not graduate in four years from an exclusive private university only to suddenly realize that there is a crisis of authority and identity in the world (in other words, if you are in the OTHER 85% of Americans in their 20s), this book's premise and themes will leave you dry.The voices in this book seem to have discovered that you can't major in Changing The World, but have not yet figured out why."
2,Anyone for giving Jennifer Lopez a reality smack?,"If the laws regarding truth in advertising applied to music lyrics, Ms. Lopez would be behind bars right now. If she was still actually ""Jenny From the Block,"" it would not occur to her to sing lyrics like ""I used to have a little, but now I have a lot."" For someone who has so relentlessly bent her life and her men to advance her career and then whine about ""bad"" publicity...C'mon, Lady, how dumb do you think we are? I can't wait for Weird Al to get hold of this one."
3,breaks every few months,These should be made out of cast bronze; the center screen breaks apart from the ring every month or two. We bought three anticipating this problem and I am now ordering more unless I can find something similar in metal.
5,Weekend riders need this book,"I have waited a long time to buy this book, and now that I finally have it I wish I'd bought it sooner. It has great explanations of how yoga connects with horseback riding. The exercises range from stretching techniques to easy muscle toning for primary riding areas, like the glutes. The stretching exercises are a great way to relax before going to bed. If you're a ""weekend"" rider and would like a way to work a little bit on your toning and balance between rides, this is the book. Don't let the yoga part turn you off. It's great!"
5,Exactly as promised,"I bought this for a friend, an equestrian currently working overseas. The book arrived ahead of schedule and in great shape. As I know nothing about this sort of thing I can't attest to the contents of the book, but the seller exceeded all expectations."
4,dissapointed - do it your selfer,"i mounted this blade on a dewalt 10"" table saw & tried to use itto do some beveled trim cuts . it left burn marks the lenght ofthe cut (3"" to 9"") - it may be that this blade is intended foruse as a cut off - only blade . it works great in a miter saw ??"
5,Great item,"Used this blade for the first time and was very pleased with the performance. I have used similar blades that worked as well but cost twice as much, for the price it's a real deal."
4,Thor is hilarious!,Thor is hilarious! His routine about his mom's behavior and the cheerleading affect is worth the price alone.
4,Handy and a Great Gift,"We bought a couple of these for gifts; they appeared to be an interesting novelty item. The recipients immediately put them into use. Once we saw how useful they are for handling wine bottles over a tablecloth (or any other clean surface) we purchased two more for ourselves. We use them all the time. No more drip spots!I'm giving four stars because the coasters are a bit less substantial than I expected. They are not at all flimsy but lighter than I expected after seeing the ""stainless steel"" description."
2,a clumsy fake by an amateur composer who knows his Schubert,"Not recommended--too many pointless modulations, some of which are to a wrong chord or wrong key--the scherzo is abruptly truncated and along with the finale contains material lifted from the 9th symphony along with inferior counterpoint--Schubert would never have let somthing like this escape from his pen--it has pleasant moments but, taken as a whole, is annoying to listen to. I'm sorry I wasted my money on it."
4,"Cute story, not for beginners","My daughter really loved this story, but a stern warning to parents trying to encourage a struggling reader: there are far too many words per page here for beginning or reluctant readers.The story is completely age appropriate for 1st graders and a bit older, but despite some of the other reviews, no way was my 6yo going to be able to read this by herself.If your child is a natural reader, than certainly get this book. But for kids still gaining skills and confidence, plan on this as something you read TO them, rather than something they can read alone."
2,I really wanted to like this item,I have used the poll type of shower organizer and my husband hated it because he didn't like that it would rust. I need a few things that I don't want on the floor so I really needed this to be great. The tape doesn't stick for very long. The rubber cups don't really work that great either. My husband jury rigged it with a plastic kitchen thing and nailed it in the wall. Also the metal bar rust too. But what does anyone think with metal in the shower.
4,So good I bought two.,"The M12V is solidly the best router bang for buck. Amateurs and professionals would appreciate this tool. First off, the fit and finish were great. The first time I turned the router on I was instantly impressed with it's easy start-up which controls the torque and prevents little ""kick-back"" while holding the tool. The operation and performance were not disapointing either. I was so pleased with the first one, I bought a second for a dedicated router table.PROS: cost; power; performance; versatility (variable speed) included accessories; good company for support or service if neededCONS: no real dust collection built in (only resaon I didn't think it was a 5 star rating)"
4,Getting back to wood working,"Quiet and a soft start, tools have changed. Its a work horse alright. I put four stars for I don't know what a five is? OH don't order the adjustment handle, it come with one.Dani"
4,Powerful Tool,"I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V. It doesn't bog down under load. Cuts are easy and smooth. I use it on a router table, and it is works well. The major reasons I didn't give it a five are: One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well. I replaced it with a Router Raizer and it works much better. Two, the single wrench just doesn't work well. The sliding latch is does not stay in place. It is almost all you can do to change bits with two hands (you need three). I am trying to purchase a second wrench, and I think it will improve the function greatly. Other than this, I am very pleased with the router and would buy it again. I really liked the price..."
1,"Beware: M12V is Great, but Discontinued. Got an M12V2 Instead","I ordered an M12V, but got an M12V2 because the router I ordered is discontinued (even though there was no mention of it anywhere). Amazon/Contractors Tools/Hitachi felt that substituting a $197 router for the $324 router I paid for was OK. Luckily, I was able to find an M12V router locally. I highly recommend one if you can find it. The M12V2 is more plastic and less ruggedly built, but the price is proportional, so it may not be a bad deal. I am now dealing with the mess of getting an RMA from the manufacturer because they shipped me something I didn't order. The router I received isn't actually shown on Contractors Tools' website, and now the image for the M12V router has been replaced by some combo kit, not the actual router image shown when I ordered it. I seriously looked at a Bosch 1619evs instead."
4,hitachi m12v router,BEEFY! Nowhere close to this price will you find as powerful and reliable a router! This will drive panel-door bits with ease! Very happy with my purchase.
5,Hitachi 12V,I have owned this router for 3 years and have enjoyed using it very much. It has simple and easy to use features. It also has ample power for routing almost any job. I recommend it highly and am presently considering another one to set up permantly in my router table.
5,a clever juxtaposition of the civils rights struggle and internment,"This is the story of a young girl who finds a friend and a family with the Japanese American Hatsunes; however, they lose touch when World War II breaks out and the Hatsunes are interned. Years later she is reunited with her friend while working for the civil rights movement. The story is a clever juxtaposition of the social issues--the civil rights struggle of the 1960s and the incarceration of Japanese Americans in the 1940s."
4,Gift for my husband,my husband is a firefighter here in TX so I bought him this knife for Christmas. He says he impressed with it and the functions of each tool but..there is always a but when giving a gift to my awesome hubby so here goes the but...the strap provided to click on to his gear is too long. Any firefighter reading this will know what that means for sure but I don't; Th kind of knives I use are all eating or cooking utensils
5,Great Product,Bought this for a paramedic friend of mine and he loves it! He carries it every day and tells me it is very useful on the job.
1,Great Knife for the full 2 weeks that i had it,"This rescue knife is great; providing all of the functions described. However, the sheath is so weak that it unbuckled frequently when moving around. After all of two weeks of using this knife, it has fell off my belt while on duty. The Sheath may have came with the knife for free, but it has now cost me seventy dollars. Very poorly made and disappointing from such a trusted company as Gerber.Let me add this is the first piece of equipment to have ever fell of my belt in many years of working ems."
5,A Wonderful Ninth,"This is indeed a spectacular Ninth. You can see Karajan's total involvement from the opening bars. What makes it great for me, though, is not only the playing and singing, but the video treatment of the conductor and orchestra. Unfortunately, I find many Karajan's videos spoiled because of really odd camera treatments. The orchestra is lined up in an artificial way, or it is highlighted in a way that it detracts from the music. None of that here. Karajan said that he made videos so as to preserve his art. This is one of the few videos that really captures the essence of Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic."
3,Shout bamalama,"Lugging an obnoxiously long declaration for a title ""How the Supersuckers Became the Greatest Rock & Roll Band in the World"" is a compilation of some of the Supersuckers' finest moments. The term ""finest moments"" may lack any objective relevance though. The Supersuckers excel at a sort of tongue-in-cheek bamalama, a hammering hybrid of garage punk and Motorhead metal, that can quite easily make it hard to distinguish one sonic assault from another. The exceptions, predictably, are the standouts. Versions of Ice Cube's ""Dead Homiez"" and Willie Nelson's ""Bloody Mary Morning"" drastically change the sonic palate. Steve Earle joins the band for a version of ""Before They Make Me Run"" that cuts the Stones to shreds. The tracks off their ""country"" album (""Must've Been High"") also help break up the one dimensional rockin'. But overall, if it's high octane, no-frills rawk you're seeking, you could do far worse."
4,You Need This,Superb collection from the boys. Some great no frills rawk. Only problem is a few unfortunate MIA's such as Mighty Joe Young and their toasted version of Burnin' up. Buy this.
5,It was the best of it's kind,"I likes when Belinda find a bloody doll's head in the mailbox. Special Delivery! A book such as this one, draws people to it. It is like a magnet. As soon as I began I could not stop reading until I finished the book. It was very hard to stop."
5,"An excellent combination of ""real life"",""fantasy"" & ""poetry""",In reading this book I was able to relate to certain characters and come to peace within myself regarding some of the stress that I had been under from past relationships. Everynight before I go to bed I promise to be good to the lover in my dreams....Shellie
1,Did not fit my Hitachi TR12,"This product does not fit my router, although I was led to believe it would by the product description. It has no value to me."
1,Torment to endure.,"If Truman Capote had been born with a low IQ and no talent, this film could have been his creation. Watching The Neon Bible is like enduring a unique kind of pain that I could only compare to the first awful aches of a gall bladder attack. You're not completely sure what's happening, but you just know it's going to get much, much worse.And, it did."
2,Wasted talent on a Borrrrring film...,"There IS some talent at work here, but -MAN- does this need a heavy guiding hand...and...some serious editing. I just watched about three days of this movie, and still can't figure it out."
5,Forever Faithful. A Study of Florence Ballard by Randall Wil,"Thank you Randall for a book that appropriately takes sensationalism out of the life story of Florence Ballard, nearly 30 years after her death. So many authors try to ""up"" sales by ""embellishing facts"". That you chose to put out a book from a thesis makes it all the more credible for me and I write this at a time when I am only half way through it! That she is still ""writable about"" is testimony to the major contribution she played in developing the ""Supremes"" distinctive sound within the overall sound of ""Motown"". A sober and accurate writer. Thanks!!"
5,A wonderful story of friendship through tragedy and triumph,Conny has written a wonderful book detailing the finding and cultivating of friendshiops . . . something that is sometimes lost in today's society. This book is a heartwarming tribute to the humanity in all of us!
5,This is the definative archival STAR WARS Trilogy book!,"Without a doubt,nothing compares to this immense book,which chronicles nearly every character,droid,creature,ship,weapon,and planet in the original STAR WARS Trilogy.A must have for fans of the Greatest Space Fantasy of All."
5,The definitive look at the Star Wars trilogy.,"A gift for my birthday, my wife bought this for me with some reservation. Even at a wonderful discount it was a steep investment for an oversized picture book. What I received surpassed my expectations - and well worth more than what was paid for it. It is a complete look at the trilogy, from models to storyboards to costume design to special effects to background character information. I am a veteran of the trilogy, having seen Star Wars: A New Hope over 400 times since 1977 - this book teaches me something new each time I open it.I highly recommend The Star Wars Chronicles."
1,Adds so much static its not usable,Any movement introduces a huge amount of static. I've tried rotating the connector back and forth to try and clean off any corrosion on the contacts which didn't help at all.
5,Beautiful and Useful,I used this book as a Lay Eucharistic Minister on all of my ships for those occassions when special or evening prayers were needed. Also extremely useful at family gatherings and those happy and sad events. My son-in-law is in RCIA and I bought him this book for contemplation and to aid him in his prayerful preparation for his First Holy Communion and Confirmation.
2,a good prayerbook for beginners,"I think this prayerbook would probably be most useful for mature teens, young adults, and fresh converts. It offers little more than the usual traditional prayers, which is why I find it so disappointing. I do enjoy the short prayers for morning and evening and the obscure devotions such as prayers to the five sacred wounds but I don't think they warrant an entire prayerbook of their own."
1,not worth the bucks!,"If your NOT looking for more than 1/3 a book telling you why you should monitor mibs with snmp and 2/3 of a book listing common mibs to monitor [most of which are router specific and can be found for free in many places], then this is the book for you. All others....DON'T BOTHER!"
4,Let me give it to you like how you like it girl,"A good purchase whether it's the first gift or a gift later down the timeline, it's exciting, so make it a gift only once for the good occasion. The scent is unique in a positively attractive way. Like this a lot, but love the girl more."
4,The title splains it all!!!,"This redneck is surely the Al Yankovic of country music. Wives Do It, Third Rock, Mindy McCready and the title song are excellent parodies of countrified music today. The originals, First Redneck On The Internet and Hankenstein prove that this crazy hickster is more than just a country clown. He has talent!!! A great effort. The world anticipates the next musical joyride. Keep yuckin it up, Cledus!!! (no relation)"
5,Good. Clean. Fun.,"this is a very entertaining album, Cledus T. Judd did a great job melding his usual humor with sing-a-long style beats and rhythms."
5,"Clamp n Cut 24""","Great idea, wonderful new product on the market I also bought the 48"" I use these items all the time now, would not do a job without them. Keep up the good work Gator Clamps you are bringing good quality tools to the market and as a serious DIY'r I appreciate it."
3,Beck Arnley is just a name,"I have heard countless times that Beck Arnley parts are really good, and that a lot of times you get OEM. I have yet to get an OEM part from them. This is probably made by SMP, and I could have gotten a SMP pressure regulator from another website for a little cheaper. The diaphragm is smaller than the OEM one. I haven't installed it yet, and I'm sure it will work fine. I'm just not happy about the mark up for the name on the box."
4,HITACHI DUST BAG,"JUST RECENTLEY STARTED USING THE HITACHI 81/2 SLIDING SAW AND SO FAR IT HAS BEEN VERY GOOD, JUST A COUPLE OF IMPROVEMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE, ONE IS THE 45 DEGREE DETENTS NEED TO BE MORE PRONOUNCED ALSO THE DUST CATCHER NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED I TRIED TO SEAL ALL THE PLACES IT THROWS OUT THE SAW DUST WITH LIMITED SUCESS"
2,"Great saw, lousy service for parts.",I have been trying to get the Slide Fence Assembly for nearly a year now and no luck. I just talked to Hitachi and they say they have a problem but it is still backordered. I am not impressed with this sort of service. Even an outstanding tool with lousy service is not a good thing.
1,Don't Bother,I never read anything by Rachel Lee before and I don't think I will again. The people in this book never came to life for me so I didn't care what happened to them. This book was very dull and boring.Take my advice don't waste your money.
5,By the Godz I Loved it!,"Insane much! This movie rocked the scalez when it came to mixing a hint of ""The Evil Dead"" with ""House on Haunted Hill""... I was in eyeball heaven. I couldn't turn away from the TV in fear that I might have miss something vital to the story/plot or miss a ""jump sequence"". All in all a A++++ Movie... must buy, a must rent, either way come-on Seth Green is in it. He rockz & made the ending VERY interesting."
2,Terrible sequel to the best game in the series,"I had high hopes for capcom after their BN3 masterpiece. I really did. I played this game with high anticipation... and was let down so hard I didn't even finish it.Why?The worst, THE. WORST. was the Shademan mini games. I about threw my GBA at the wall. NEVER make it so TEDIOUS to do something as simple as that! (Can't spoil it).The music is... it definitely has a theme, and it sounds interesting at times, but for the most part I didn't like it. Personal preference there.The map designer was on crack and decided to make a huge # sign (with more lines) as a map, so it takes forever to find the right way unless you ALWAYS memorize the entire map. It is very difficult to navigate.The soul system is confusing. The style system was very simple and while it took a long time to change, it worked.I had high hopes for this game... Shademan's mini game (and yes, it is early in the game) was the end of it. The plot was... less than believable either."
3,The weakest in the series,"I give this three stars because of the double souls, the netbattle tournament and the occasional net crimes. Battle networks 1, Network Transmission, 2, 3, Battle Chip Chalenge were far better than this. I am willing to bet that battle network 5 will be better than this as well"
4,A definite competitor to Delta,"This is the first time I have bought a stationary woodworking machine that was not a Delta and I did have some reservations at first. Assembly was simple, and the various initial adjustments were not difficult, just cumbersome to perform. Ideally, the machine should arrive correctly adjusted. Any unpainted metal part comes covered with some kind of preservation oil and it did take quite a bit of time to remove. Fit and finish are excellent and the machine appears well built throughout. Based on my initial impressions, I will give serious thought to other Jet products in the future."
5,"A ""Must Have"" Modern Dance DVD!","From classical to modern, the dancing and choreography here is pure virtuosity. The dancers are technically superb and in perfect physical condition. The Brazilian influence is only very slight and what is very obvious is a solid classical ballet foundation, both in the dancing and the choreography. There is one piece with pairs of men and women, combining elements of ballet, modern, and ballroom, displaping amazing virtuosity. There is also a very complete documentary included."
1,just plain lousy,"I have had these less than a year and use them to trim my mini schnauzer after he's had a wash and dry. First they are heavy and after the first couple of uses, they tended to get pretty warm even though I use a cooler spray that I bought along with the clippers. I replaced the blades because they got dull pretty fast as well..I've had cheaper clippers that lasted longer and cut better. Now the motor runs but the clippers don't move at all. I've taken extremely good care of these, oiling and cleaning after every use so why they aren't working is beyond me. I've priced the cost of shipping and having the unit repaired and it's going to cost close to $60.......I think I'll spend the money on different clippers because these just aren't worth squat."
1,don't waste your money,"HORRIBLE,HORRIBLE,HORRIBLE! What a waste of money! I would be even more mad if I spent the price of $133.00 instead of $85.00 for this piece of junk. I used it once and it does not even cut my Cocker Spaniels hair. The scissors that came with it cut his hair better than the clipper's did. I want my money back!! Do not buy these. I did a lot of research and thought I was getting a good product, but apparently I was wrong. My cordless Oster clippers were 10 times better and cost less. Don't make the mistake I did, there not worth $20.00 bucks. I work hard for my money and this will keep me from NEVER buying there products again."
3,.,"Acid Queen is a mixed bag of rock, pop,and rhythm and blues. Nothing really exciting on this album. The highlights of the album are Acid Queen and Rockin and Rollin which was recorded with Tina's ex husbnd Ike Turner."
1,"Of all the books regarding lupus, I was most dissatisfied.","Very one-sided. I suffer from lupus myself and I felt very sorry for the wife. It seemed as if the husband ( the author) was the victim...he didn't realize that his wife suffered a great deal. I would not recommend this book to anyone, especially someone who has the disease."
1,Cuts Make It Incoherent,"If you hadn't seen this film before you'd never figure out where Freddy Malins came from - was he dropped from a spaceship into the parlor after Aunt Julia sang? And you wouldn't know why Gabriel and Gretta go to a hotel after leaving the party - the whole antecedent discussion has been dropped (as well as Gretta's showing off of her galoshes). And on and on and on. What 24-year-old whiz-kid/idiot at Lionsgate decided he or she knew better than John Huston? Don't waste your money.12/16/09: I emailed Lionsgate to ask when I would receive a replacement copy for the defective DVD I had purchased. Here is their reply, in a facsimile of the English language: ""We apologized but there is no released date at this time."" So apparently they have no plans to replace the defective copies, or to release a true copy of this wonderful movie. Astonishing."
1,Missing 10 mins.,I pre-ordered this disk so there were no reviews at that time. I gave it as a gift to a HUGE fan of this movie. I just found out that 10 mins are missing and I could definitely hear the disappointment. My friend has waited for years for this to go on DVD-why would they cut scenes at this point? I see that other have experienced the same frustrations.
4,The real kung fu,"I have seen both VHS and DVD versions of this movie. You must get the DVD one to watch the full widescreen (about 2.35:1 which tell you how much were missing in P&S VHS version) and to enjoy the excellent video / audio quality. It offers both Chinese Mandrin and dubbed Cantonese sound tracks.(with English subtitle) The shaolin monks in the movies were students from Chinese official martial art schools. Most of the action were real stuff, not like those camera tricks or fake stuff in modern kung fu movies."
2,concert 1992,"Keep in mind that this concert was done in 1992 and the acoustics and photography appeared to be very amateurish. But if you like The Church, the music is worth listening to."
2,Curmudgeonly,"Our small group at church read this book together (we are all parents of young children) and we decided that this author was a total curmudgeon. At first we thought ht was a Catholic priest who was celibate and childless (which explained a lot of his unrealistic views on child rearing) but then it dawned on us that he might actually have kids himself. Of course there are some grains of insight in this book, but overall, spend your precious time reading something worthwhile or entertaining instead of the rantings of a pedantic, moralistic curmudgeon."
2,A marginal sharpener,I tried it on some knifes. The sharpening side hardly works. the honing side seems to be OK.Go for a better sharpener. You get what you pay for
3,I imagined the handle was rubber or silicone.,"The handle is plastic. The sharpening angle appears to be 30 degrees. I sharpen a bit steeper than that. Pull through sharpeners aren't very good for sharpening, but if you aren't good with a proper sharpening stone, this may work for you.At a low enough price point, I'm satisfied. Amazon had it for just under $3."
3,Knife Sharpener,"Actually, this is one of the few items I've purchased from Amazon & was disappointed. In my opinion, it's an average, at best, knife sharpener. Going by the previous reviews, I thought this would be a great sharpener for our hunting / skinning knives. After the first few cuts, I switched back to our old sharpener. I'll keep it in the kitchen for light work, but it's not going to work on the big stuff."
5,Good quality toy,This is a good toy! My friends son loves it he is fascinated by the tiger! It is safe too as he did not get any allergy or rashes.. I think it is a great toy! It's been two years and it is still intact with the fur! I think it is wonderfully made! Most important it is safe!
5,Sturdy and easy to assemble,"This crib was easy to assemble. The only thing in the beginning was the metal pins, the directions do not actually say to use them, you are just suspose to know where those goes. Also the washers for the 12 bolts are suspose to be used and the directions didn't tell us that. BUt I really like the fact that you can do the front rail with ease and simply with one hand. It should work wonderfully for my twins."
3,What's the deal with the plastic parts?,"I am calling the customer service department for Delta for the second time because of the shoddy plastic crib rail parts. They bend and eventually don't hold the rail up, and I've had the crib for only a year. This time, having reinstalled a new plastic rail adjustment part about six months ago, I have to request a new crib leg in addition to the plastic part that broke. The the screw holding the plastic part onto the leg broke off into the wood.The crib is stylish and cute, and I like the versatility, but I don't quite feel that my child is safe, because the rail might fall down and she might fall out. The delta website is also very primitive and complicated to navigate, and customer service is only available business hours on the east coast."
5,Great all by itself!,"Yeah, I know, this movie doesn't really follow the book, but it wasn't prudent to describe the passionate love affair bewteen Hester Prynne and Arthur Dimmesdale in Hawthorne's time. Although the acting by Moore could have been better, it was still a great film. Nova Scotia was a great location spot. Oldman did a perfect job!"
1,A fully useless DVD release,"I haven't seen this DVD and certainly will not. Hell, the movie was shot in a 2,35:1 aspect ratio and Buena Vista thinks it smart to release it in pan & scan only, even through they delivered a full widescreen version back in the good ol' laserdisc days.My suggestion is to stay away from that DVD and wait for a proper widescreen release."
5,SUPER film!!,"Gary Oldman is very very hot, sexy in this film.. there is a scene sex with him that you have never seen it with Gary Olmdan.I recommand it!"
1,Not for intelligent viewers,"As a great fan of Nathaniel Hawthorne's original novel and also of Gary Oldman's acting, I awaited this film with some eagerness. In vain, it turned out. It is among the most awful movies I've ever wasted two hours watching. In this film version, the story is given a totally ridiculous happy ending, with the Reverend rescuing Hester Prynne on horseback and riding off into the sunset to live happily ever after with her! Hester is supposed to live out the rest of her days as an outcast! Terrible stuff. If you're looking for decent films set in the C17th / C18th United States, try 'The Crucible' or 'Sleepy Hollow'."
2,Joffe's version of The Scarlet Letter is inferior.,"If you want a version of The Scarlet Letter that is true to Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel of the same name, Joffe's film version is not for you. The version will appeal to moviegoers who enjoy the lurid details that an R-rated film can offer, but were only hinted at in Hawthorne's day. For students of American Literature, the Meg Foster version is best. It is true to Hawthorne and is the film of choice for American Literature instructors."
1,So pathetic!,"""free adaptation"" is not the right term for this movie. ""Piece of (garbage)"" would be much closer. At every turn, it forsakes even the key points of the book's plot to add gratuitous love scenes, and some scenes that are pure nonsense, ranging from silly to appalling, such as the skinny dipping scene."
4,Good Memories,I love this movie because it brought back so many memories that I just had to have it. For anyone interested in forbidden love and twisted mistrust then I would consider this movie for then
2,a real laugher,"Demi Moore's overwrought acting and nearly complete misunderstanding of her role make ""The Scarlet Letter"" a real laugher. If you are looking for something to brighten your day, this unintended parody will more than do the trick.Anyone familiar with the American classic will find few similarities here. If anything, by the movie's end, you will be sympathizing with the clergyman who was the weak-spined anti-hero of the original. High students who view this film as an aid to their assigned reading of Hawthorne are strongly cautioned, as it would not be helpful.Recommended only as an example of to what truly awful level Demi Moore's interpretive acting can sink."
3,"ehhh, not so much.","It helps a little bit. The stop is pretty primitive.If you are really broke, this is an improvment over the bare saw, but if you have the time or the money, make a table with extentions or buy one of the mitre saw stands."
4,Good Watch/Bad Watch,"Bought this DVD discounted to half price - assuming ""Inherit the Wind"" would be somewhat worth the price. I was a little hesitant because of the earlier movie staring Spencer Tracy, which is the standard-of-comparison. Found this version an acceptable watch. However, forget the other movie. ""Town without Pity"" was a flop on the big screen and the DVD doesn't make it better."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY,Setting up the rails was easy then it came to assembling the fence. That was also easy. Getting it straight and true was another issue. Not my idea of a good fence. Having to tighten down then check then redo the assembly screws to get it straight is not what i consider quality. Very good saw though. Maybe Jet should stick to that.
1,"Yeah, i couldn't be more dissapointed",I think there there the worst band i've ever heard. The 80's were meant to stay in the 80's. Espeacially the really bad pop music and the clothes. Now mixed with this so-called new grunge era i could puke.
5,Just Over the Mountain- Good read,Always good read by Robyn Carr. I love how she uses the same characters in different settings. Makes abook interesting.
5,"Ken Cole Reaction is the best, crisp, fresh scent that never overpowers or emits too light of a scent.","Ken Cole Reaction is the best, crisp, fresh scent that never overpowers or emits too light of a scent. Awesome product."
3,NOT the same scent as from the store :/,"Purchased this online because of the price and it's definitely my fav cologne at the moment. Beware, once purchased, there is no return and for some reason my bottle must be really old/expired as it does NOT smell the same as the bottles I have previously purchased at dept. stores. I have both bottles with me and did a side-by-side smell test (yes, seriously) and my friends can notice a difference as well so it's not just me. Well one of them couldn't but he doesn't even wear cologne. The scent is just not as bright or fresh.. no other way to really describe it. I can't return it so I'm thinking of giving this expired one away and keep buying from Macy's even it if does cost more. At least it will smell right. It's strange that they can mail it to you yet you cannot mail it back claiming it's a dangerous good."
4,sweet,It has nice smell as compared to its price. Giving 4 stars because of its strong sweet smell. But it's great overall.
5,AN INTRIGUING MASCULINE FRAGRANCE,"""Zesty"" is a word that comes to mind when first catching a scent of Kenneth Cole's ""Reaction,"" It's a very masculine and energetic fragrance with notes of Juicy Lime and Crisp Green Apple. It reminds one of a guy who's on the go, very much alive. He's fun, contemporary, intelligent.Reaction"" also boasts hints of Watermelon, Patchouli, Sandalwood and Musk.The bottle is state of the art, crystal clear with a heavyweight glass base and channels of green, again denoting energy, through side walls.Energetic, electric, very male - that's ""Reaction."""
2,Broke easy,The headband broke on most of the halos the first time the girls put them on and there were even a few that came broke. Disappointed.
2,Quirky and yawny,"This is a sort of Ten Little Indians set in space (a very overused plot engine). Naturally, the astronauts disappear one by one leading to a ""climatic"" ending sequence, which will show you that you have just wasted a portion of your lives. The sets, the acting, the plot, everything is very, very tired, redundant, and surprisingly turgid for the nightmare this is."
3,No more interludes!,"I really like Angela Johnson's voice and her songs are great. I think I would have rated this cd between 4 and 5 stars (5 for her voice and 4 for the songs), but I only rated it 3 stars because of the annoying interludes that she places at the end of many of her songs. If these were done on separate tracks so you program them out, this would be fine - but it doesn't make me want to hear the cd over and over again."
4,GREAT buy!!,This is a heck of a buy and I wished I had owned one long before now. The ONLY flaw is see is the feet eventually coming off. So far so good. The rest of it is well made and is of good quality. even the fittings fit well and are produced in a way I don't much if any trouble in the long haul.
2,Not like the original!!!,"The original version of Vitabath was a thick gel and the smell would stay with you throughout the day. This stuff is a like a watered down version with the same scent. The smell washes of your body with the soap. About the only thing that has not changed is the price, (now we can easily say this stuff is way over priced! The reason I give it two stars is that when I smell it in the bottle it still reminds me of my childhood at grandma's house. Other than the smell your probaly better of buying bar soap."
2,Disappointment in a brand name,"I heard of the Vitabath brand decades ago, but this is my first experience with the product. The scent is not as pleasant as I expected from the fragrances listed on the package. It does not clean well. I do not favor bubbles as amusement: I take a bath to get clean. This product did nothing but dry my skin."
1,The original Spring Green formula has changed,"Shame on Vitabath. I've used the Spring Green gelee for years and I just replenished my stock with two 1 gallon bottles. The incredible evergreen scent that permeates my apartment every time I take a shower is effectively gone. The scent is so weak now that it fades out almost immediately. I'm so disappointed in Vitabath - I went to their web site but found no mention of a change in their formula. If you are expecting the wonderful, aromatherapy-grade evergreen scent, be forewarned: It's a thing of the past."
5,vitabath is vital,"Vitabath is the best bubble bath in the world! it has a great piney scent and make tons of bubbles. it leave your skin soft and buttery. the big bottle, 128 oz, makes for lots and lots of bathes."
4,Interesting album,"This is interesting because it shows how six great composers used this basic theme, and put their individual stamp on it."
5,just sisters,"A great book my 2 sisters loved it,I bought one for my mom to give to her sister,they both loved it."
2,Leaky bottles!,"Although this spray has a really wonderful, natural, non-perfume scent, I had to give a lower review since the bottles leak horribly! We have used this product in the past, and really enjoyed it. So, I ordered two bottles. Both of them leak so much each time we spray that our hands are covered with the product and it is dripping from the bottle. In the past, we have had a little problem with leaking after using the spray for a long time. But now, as soon as we began to use it, it was leaking like crazy! I hope they figure out what is wrong with these, because there is no other spray that comes close to the smell. I can't stand most sprays that are full of chemicals. This smells like you just cut up a lime in the room."
3,"table is great, but track lacks durability","The table itself is great! It's just the right height & size for my 3 1/2 year old son. He loves it & I especially like all the storage space. The track on the other hand is made out of very cheap wood & splinters easily. He just happened to get a large Thomas set for Christmas as well, so we'll be replacing the track with it. I suppose if we glued down the original track we wouldn't have to worry about it splintering as much, but that would take the fun away from him in creating his own layout."
1,Really stretches poetic license,"This book goes from implausible to ridiculous. There are so many holes in the story and so many unbelievable leaps of faith that it loses credibility and coherence. Of course, fiction is escapism, and I doubt anyone picked up this book expecting great literature, but come on! I was going to list a few of the things I found absolutely insane, but I'm just going to name one: disrupting a 120kV field with the magnet in the receiver of a telephone. nuff said. The only good thing about this book was that I finished it in two hours."
4,A fun movie-like read,"The author himself likens this book to Jurassic Park and Aliens, which I'd say is pretty accurate. This was a fast and fun book to read. The constant chasing and hunting made me a little weary toward the end. You'll also need to prepare for a video-game like hero.Appropriateness: This would be a great book for young teens if not for the fair amount of language and several bloody scenes. There is no love interest in this book, so nothing to worry about there."
1,Doesnt even rate as amateur writing,"This is the poorest excuse for a novel I have ever come across in a bookstore. I dislike being so critical and I understand this was a first novel, but the truth is, I feel deceived and conned from purchasing this book and would like to warn others. The only effort put into this book is in advertising. This does not in any way qualify as professional writing, it is beyond poor."
5,a fine machine,"I bought the Jet 10"" saw and it is great. Plenty of power, I rip through 8/4 maple and cherry like butter. The finish is great, The assembly was a piece of cake. Just the slightest little bit of adjustment in the fence was needed. I didn't spend more than 5 minutes adjusting the saw, Delta should learn a little from them. As far as the fine adment on the fence, well it is just easier to tap the fince with your fist to move it 1/32 of an inch. Maybe I am just old school... I considered heavly between the Delta and the Jet but I am glad I got the Jet. There is nothing that irratates me more is than when you spend $1500 or more and nothing is in line.... I will buy other jet products."
4,Great soft ball,"You probably know that you need the right ball for the right situation. If you are a beginner to mid-handicapper who wants a good feel and want to be able to drop a ball and stick it on tough ground, these are a good bet.I got a mixed bag with quite a few of these, along with PD High and Long as well. My course has a LOT of hills, and quite a few holes where a very high, soft shot is required. These help keep me on the green, whereas distance balls tend to skip off the back of the green more often. And I strongly prefer the feel of these over distance balls."
3,Primal Waters Review from a Fan,"I started reading the MEG series when I stumbled on a copy of Hell's Aquarium. I was hooked immediately and got a hold of the rest of the series. I love sharks, and i love the notion of live Megalodons, and I adore how Steve Alten does justice to their intelligence, speed, and ferocity.I will admit though that I felt rather let down when I finally read Primal Waters. The plot is good, the action is incredibly fast-paced, but it felt like something was missing... Maybe I just didn't connect as well with the Daredevils, or maybe it's just because I don't like reality TV, but I didn't find some of it as believeable as before... I'm not entirely sure.Now, don't get me wrong: This is still an incredible book, but it was a little less memorable than the rest of the series. I just had a harder time getting sucked into it and reading long hours into the night. It's well written and fun to read, and it's very fast-paced. It's just not my favorite in the series!"
4,In one word: fun!,"Steve Alten is a pretty good storyteller. Even though in lesser hands this could be an awful movie of the week scenario, here it works just fine. I think it's because although the plot is replete with impossible coincidences, many clichés and just because happenstances, Alten does it all in a very dynamic and enthusiastic way without either taking himself too seriously or his readers for idiots. It's a bit like an Indiana Jones movie: you just enjoy the ride!Just one thing, though, that should not have escaped the editor's eye: it's the genus name that is capitalized, not the species'. It's therefore ""Charcharodon megalodon"", and not carcharodon Megalodon, no matter how much the very word megalodon sounds fit for capitalization!!!"
5,Primal Waters = fantastic,"If you liked the Meg and the Trench then you will love this. Another great masterpiece from Steve Alten, which can only be described as amazing."
2,Just doesn't work,I enjoyed the first two MEG novels but this time out the author seems bored with the subject. Mr. Alten focuses his pen on the reality show craze as a plot device to get Jonas Taylor onto the sea and in the way of another megladon shark. Taylor's wife and son also tangle with megladon sharks on their own. That's the main problem with the book as Mr. Alten attempts to tell three weak stories instead of coming up with one strong story idea.
2,DAMAGED DVD,"I ordered The Trials of Ted Haggard. The content was good what I could see of it, for most of the DVD was not in good condition and I could not watch it!!!"
1,Not exactly what we need released by Jerry Lee,"The major problem with this CD is that it has songs that have been issued too many times before on similar CDs,none of which show Jerry Lee's mastery of all the styles he is really good at. Such throwaway songs as ""Good golly Miss Molly"" or ""Sweet little 16"",in particular,have no place among what truly is the 'best of Jerry Lee Lewis'. This album should be called ""The worst of Jerry Lee Lewis"" instead.Advice: don't waste your money on albums like this,buy the Sun box set instead (because there is no single CD of this era of Lewis that contains all the blues,Western swing and oldtime country and gospel songs Lewis excelled on during this period apart from the box set)."
2,Not for the absolute beginner,"This book was a disappointment. I found it impossible to understand from a beginner's point of view. There are no logical explanations of things like what fabrics can be used, how the strips should be made, etc. It seems to me that this book is aimed at those who already have an understanding of how braided rugs are made. The language and instructions are not clear and the hand-drawn illustrations don't help. I'd suggest checking out other books, as I will, for the complete beginner. I'm returning this one."
2,Sci-fi for Kindergarten,"I'm a big fan of L. Ron Hubbard, Battlefield Earth is one of my all-time faves. Jet's an interesting character but the story and the antagonist feel overly-simplistic, repetitive and a bit dull. I stopped reading the second book after about 100 pages and gave up."
5,A real enjoyable read; satire at its best!,"This is one of a ten book series written about an alien confederacy and how an evil but powerful man from that confederacy is ruining earth from afar. Another man, the protagonist, is sent to earth to try and right matters. What I most enjoyed was that this book, and 6-7 others in the series were written from the sickly demented viewpoint of one of the antagonists. The books are fast-paced, informative (good satire on this planet of ours) and an easy read"
3,gingerAZ,If you like science fiction then this is a very good book with tension and war relationships between the planets and their leaders with the earth included.Deep down in spite of this book being fictional I suspect it is based on some truth like the war in heaven as an example.A science fiction enthusiast probably would give this a 4 or 5 star rating.
2,yet another diet book,"America, when are you going to stop spending money on fad diet books and magazines? The same simple way to stay healthy has been with us since the paleolithic era, and always will be: eat all things in moderation and get some excercise. That has been the only proven formula to stay at a reasonable weight since time began. Atkins, the current flavor of the year, is popular because some people believe, fairly or not, that you can lose weight simply by cutting carbs and they forget that we all need a bit of excercise. (Have you ever noticed how a lot of these health gurus drop dead at age 50?) So, stop reading stupid books and go take a walk around the block. You know enough not to stuff yourself at McDonald's, just eat less and exercise more, for heaven's sake. Surprise! You'll lose weight!"
3,It's woriked for 2 friends but not me,"I have been on this diet for 5 days and have not lost a pound. I think it is great that all these people are losing weight. I have not cheated at all.I eat 3 eggs for breakfast, a salad for lunch, and a steak for dinner.I also drink 64 oz of water a day. I am wondering if the blood type does matter. Alot of people keep on saying if you are A or AB it is not going to work for you. I am A positive."
4,"This is not just a diet, it is a way of life. It makes sense","I work part-time at a Health/Vitamin Store, and have seen the results of people who felt hopeless where weight loss was concerned. By applying the theory behind Dr. Atkins book, I have seen the glowing healthy faces of people who have retaken their health back. They state how much energy they have now and can do so much more than before! For what I have seen, heard and read, his theory makes sense and works."
4,"Works great, but does have side affects","I was a little overweight, and I didnt like constantly torturing myself in the gym, so I tried this book. The results were amazing, I lost 15 pounds (and continuing) in 2-3 weeks. Unless my scale is totally messed up, thats some incredible results- I never seen a diet work that affectively for anybody. But, and there is a big but, it has some serious side affects, most noticeably the constant stomach/abdominal cramps. No, I am not a woman. I take multivitamins constantly, but it doesnt seem to help the problems. I guess there is no such thing as a ""perfect"" diet, and if you can tolerate the cramps, in exchange for serious weight loss, I would recomend this book/diet. The diet itself is quite simple, albeit inconvenient. I still go to the gym, but thats more for mental satisfaction, than to see any results- I know the weight loss is because of the diet."
3,Atkins is no longer the best guide to the Atkins Diet,"Dr. Atkins diet in 2003. Although the Atkins diet continues to be popular (simply because it works and is healthy), there is a better book on how to do it and the associated science. This is TheNew Atkins for a New You: The Ultimate Diet for Shedding Weight and Feeling Great.(published 2012). While the diet described is very close to the original, there has been much good science done since Dr. Atkins passed away. The Westman, Phinnney, and Volek book includes this more recent science, while still describing how to do the Atkins Diet in a readable and understandable manner. Hence, it would be the better purchase."
1,Just another fad died,"Unfortunately people are excited by this diet because it shows fast results. But it is just another diet confusing the body's metabolism. Like my husband and father in law, many people on this diet will be heavier after they stop this diet than when they started. The most successful means to lose weight is exercise (1/2 hour aerobics every day and reasonable food portions (less or nothing in the evening and generally; fewer calories than used in one day). Don't waste your money on this book."
1,No Energy!,I have been on this diet for three weeks. I use to run 30 minutes a day. I have run exactly three times since I started on this diet. I have no energy and I haven't lost one pound. I agree that I was eating too many carbos but I can't believe replacing them with butter and cheese is the answer.
3,Be careful - this is not for everyone,"I wanted to lose about 20 lbs and tried this diet last summer. The truths are: 1) Yes, if you follow it exactly, there's no hunger. 2) Weight loss happens quickly. HOWEVER, the initial loss is mostly water and it's easy to get dehydrated. The downsides to this diet (and for me they were all reasons not to do it) are: I felt awful! I had NO energy at all, I couldn't even work out. I was constipated all the time. The diet gives you very bad breath, too! I got really sick of eating high-fat, greasy food all the time. There's way too much meat, cheese and butter in this diet for my tastes. As soon as I ate some carbs again I felt 100% better. I suspect this diet will work for the very overweight and those with a carbohydrate intolerance. For people looking to lose 20 lbs or less, don't do this diet."
4,Very Interesting!!!,"The book no doubt is very interesting to read. However there's not much calcium you get from this diet. I am just on my 3rd day and I'm missing the fruits, milk, yogurt, etc.. Yes it's true that your hunger is suppressed as well as your apetitie which is great. Howevr I am getting tired of eating eggs, bacon, ham for breakfast each day. Also can someone suggest where can we go to get all these cholestrol, triglycerides, tests done. i yet have to get mine done."
3,"Did this exact diet back in college, it's the best","Everybody's body is different, right. This diet works great for us, but maybe not for my sister-in-law, you know. We're all just chemistry, so to figure what makes you lose weight, can be a completely different set up from what assists me in losing weight. And this one works so well, we did the exact diet back in college, it was very effective, and now that we've gotten rather ""out of shape"" and lack in our exercise regimen, we've found this to be great inspiration and extremely healthy for us and helps us get back on track. Enjoy the cookbook's suggested menus as well, I find them a little overwhelming as far as how much you can eat, always full, and never hungry."
5,Atkin's woRked for ME and Still iS!,"This diEt is AmaZing! I aM only 11 but I haVe tried lots oF diffeRent diEts and have NeveR haD mucH lucK. iN faCt, i have even gaIned weight From soMe of 'em. But i sTarted thIs diet and i have lOst 136 pounds in 2 months so FaR! I get sicK from Time to time though and thRow up alOt when i am sick. But i'm Used to It Now. one Time, theRe was Even some blooD in it. I goT to go to the HoSpital! It was pretty cool. When i'm not hoMe siCk, i actually can now participate in gymnasTics. And i even got my firSt kiss last weEk. My MotHer calls me preTty sometimes too. She never uSed to do That. This diet has changed mY life! I'm a wholE new person now! ThaNks Dr. Atkins!"
1,Bad plan...,"I was on this diet for three days and followed the recommendations strictly. In spite of the author's claims, I was constantly hungry, and after the first day, also sick to my stomach. I can't recommend this diet."
3,You may gain all the weight back and more if you quit,"I have tried Dr. Atkins diet before.Here is my expereince: I lost weight very quickly and was pleasantly surprised. Then towards the end of the first month I noticed that I had more energy (don't know why). In the third month, I couldn't really eat the food I was 'allowed'. Just looking at a beef pattie made me nausous! I did some reading and found out that our taste buds require some carbs to make our food feel palatable. Now I don't know how much of that is true but I couldn't look at or eat that food anymore. It just made me feel turned off from food and sick all the time. So I stopped the diet with a gradual introduction of carbs in my diet.I found that I gained back all the weight and more on stopping the program.I suggest you try other Balanced diets (that are recommended by most nutritionists and doctors) first before you try this. Balanced Diet and exercise has made me lose pounds and I haven't gained it back in a year."
1,This book is like a never ending infomercial,"This book could have been written in 50 pages and not the zillion plus pages that it reads like. Dr. Atkins, please summarize everything down to a few concise points, expand on the menue information and then I would recomend your book. This book is pure torture, but the diet is not too bad. Ummmmmm, a diet that lets you eat IN-N-OUT Burgers, protein style!!!"
5,It is working for me!,"The diet really works. In the first six weeks, I have shed 24 pounds. I am 41 years old and have gained and lost weight over and over. Finally, I think this is the diet (really a new eating lifestyle) that will work and keep the weight off. I feel good. And the weight is rolling off. Best of all, I don't feel hungry. It takes a bit of getting used to, if you have been addicted to a high carbohydrate diet (like I was). But after a short period, you don't really miss all the carbs.If you have given up hope, give this diet a try."
5,Excellent Guideline for Losing Weight,"I saw the documentaries and heard all the hype about Dr. Atkins' diet and simply dismissed it as a fad diet that would fade away as do so many of these things. But when our gastroenterologist recommended this diet to my husband, and it worked, I was astonished, not to mention delighted. He lost weight, his blood pressure dropped, and he felt better physically. Take my word for it, Dr. Atkins knows what he's talking about."
4,It DOES Work,"I've spent 20 years counting calories and starving. This book explains why high-carb/low fat diets are self-defeating and why I was constantly obsessed with food, even after eating. Altogether, I've dropped 21 lbs. in 7 1/2 weeks. It's the most painless weightloss plan I've ever used and the most successful one. I recommend it to healthy people (see a doctor first! ) who need to lose weight but who are tired of spending all their energy trying to resist temptation. Have a bacon burger with cheese and salsa and relax."
1,Diet will cause neurotransmitter imbalances,"One must seriously weigh the benefits and costs of Dr. Atkin's diet. Serotonin is a key neurotransmitter that affects our mood and overall well-being. The precursor to serotonin, tryptophan, is found in proteins but it will only cross the blood-brain barrier if it is carried in long-chain amino acids that are ONLY FOUND in carbohydrates. In other words if you cut out carbohydrates from your diet, you will eventually diminish the amount of serotonin in your brain and it will begin to affect your functioning.I strongly urge you to consult with your doctor on the pros and cons of a long term commitment to this controversial diet. Many will evidently lose weight initially but the costs incurred over the long run may very well outweigh this weight loss."
2,"Entertaining, but a little unreal","This diet started out with a bang! I read the book in 2 days (it is entertaining and informative), and began the diet. I was able to stick to it, because you are allowed all the fat/protein you want. However, my mental faculties weren't thrilled with it! My brain was dead, my moods were unreal. I was miserable and felt trapped inside a failing body. I had NO energy to work out. I had to quit this diet and go to something a bit more liberal. Thanks anyway!"
5,"Physician-author: ""Brain healthy diet""","I have recommended this diet to several patients of mine. Do not misconstrue this as medical advice. It is obvious that the concept of the food pyramid needs to be re-evaluated. Carbs play games with brain serotonin and often result in further craving. Atkins diet is great and most of my patients and some fellow physicians who are on it report improved daytime alertness. Recommend making sure you get enough fiber while on it. All the best to Dr. Atkins...Ken Giuffre MD author ""The Care and Feeding of Your Brain"""
5,I lost 18 lbs in two months.,"The Atkins program is the easiest thing I've ever done. I eat lots of beef jerky for snacks and I love being able to barbeque every day and still loose weight. My question is, I love Chinese food and I was wondering if for example Mongolian Beef w/o rice is good for the program? Please e-mail me at edhaith@yahoo.com for suggestions on some of your favorite foods to eat on the program."
3,Mayo Clinic has adopted this for heart patients!,It works but somethings may have to be changed for you if not as successful as you want.1) Caffine is deadly. Try to limit caffine intake or cut it out all together for a week and you will see a difference.2) Cut done on the salads if you see a stalemate in your progress.Mayo clinic has adopted (with 2 modification) this diet for over weight patients needing to lose 50# who are facing heart surgery! So much for NAY sayers.To maintain your desired weight is trial and error Your body determines the # of carbs you can have before you start gaining.I have been with this since the First book!
2,Definitely did not work for me!,"I gave this diet the two-week trial as specified in the book, and followed every instruction to the letter. The results? Headaches, dizziness, extreme fatigue, poor muscle tone, light-headedness, loss of sleep, nausea, acid reflux, irritability - and not one single pound lost.Atkins and his ilk may be correct in their condemnation of refined carbohydrates, but this diet has taken it too far. I haven't felt this bad since I had the flu. Thanks but no thanks, Dr. Atkins!"
2,Nauseated,I did try it for four days and did not lost a pound and was nauseated. Maybe this book works for the truly obese but not for people trying to lose twenty pounds.
5,Finally Something that is easy and works!,"This book will change how you view conventional dieting. you will eat pleanty, never hungry, feel great,and lose fat faster than on any other diet. i have been using his principles for over a year and lost 42 pounds of fat (33 in the first month) while adding 17 pounds of muscle (thru weight training). If you lift weights however u may want to eat sum carbs (complex) before a heavy session and also a high carbohydrate/protein meal after a heavy weight workout, then follow the atkins diet the rest of the time."
5,Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution,Quick shipment and well packaged. Have not read the book yet but aim to within the next few weeks. My son follows this diet and has lost 25 pounds in a short period of time.
3,No way to live long-term,"The book is well-written, but it is just not a long-term way to live. Plus eating bacon and other greasy meats is just not good for you if you overindulge, and many Atkins diet adherents do so.I've done this, lost a few pounds, and when my interest in avoiding carbs for the rest of life waned, I put those pounds on in spades. Then i tried Weight Watchers. I've lost 50 pounds and I have a sensible diet I think I can live with long-term. My advice: spend a little bit more dough (no carb pun intended), and go to Weight Watchers."
2,Eh..,"I found this book to be informative, but bland. Plus..it was too hard to stick to. It does teach you a lot about good carbs vs. bad carbs and how your system works, so in that aspect, it's good. Two weeks of no more than 20 carbs a day!?! I found that to compensate for this I was eating more of other bad stuff. Too much cheese, too much meat, and too much fat. I realized I was consuming more calories a day on this diet than before I started it. I do have to limit my carbs, but keeping it around 75g a day..I still lose weight. Plus, I limit my fat intake so not only am I doing low carbs, I'm keeping other bad stuff out of my system too. I've learned to eat closer to the source(ex. Potatoes instead of french fries) and avoid a lot of processed foods.This diet may be preferred by some, but for me, It just didn't fit with my lifestyle. If I don't like it, I won't stick with it."
1,Killer Diet,"You will lose weight on Adkins. You will also destroy your health in the process. I had constant diarrhea, among other things, until I began to eat normally again. Adkins talks about insulin. I became diabetic while on this terrible, unhealthy diet, and had to take insulin. If you want a diet that will make you lose weight, and make you healthy too, try Pritikin. It's the exact opposite of the Killer Adkins diet. It normalized my blood sugar levels, and I was able to stop using insulin. Too bad ADkins died. I wish that they had prosecuted him and jailed him for perpetrating this terrible, unhealthy diet on the public."
3,Good ideas - but this diet is NOT for everyone,"My doctor perscribed this diet...I followed it religiously and took the proper supplements. I was extremely fatigued - longer than the book said I should have been. Towards the end of the Induction diet, I became violently ill and had to stop. I must be one of the 5% of people who can't be on the diet...but it seems to work for everyone else. I recommend easing into the heavy duty protein consumption slowly (before starting the Induction diet) if you are not normally a meat eater. CONSULT A DOCTOR, as this program can be a serious shock to your system."
4,Dr Atkins' New Diet Revolution,"I have read the book, and have started the diet! I am amazed as to how much u can eat, and how quickly u seem to not be hungry! I have only been on the diet for 3days and i can already see a difference, in appetite etc...."
1,Just another fad diet,"Just like any other fad diet, people will loose weight by cutting the carbohydrates from their diet. However, once people begin to add carbohydrates back into their diet, the weight returns. I have two friends who have followed the plan and when they ""strayed"" from the plan, they gained weight. What's the point of being able to have the sour cream when one can not have the potato! I found the diet far too restrictive. It sounded like an easy plan to follow from the start, but I quickly discovered how restrictive it was. It just goes to prove that the key to dieting is moderation and exercise. We all have the ""tools"" to do it without following any fad!"
1,Diet not for me and not for some of my friends,"I tried this diet religiously for 6 weeks and lost a total of two pounds (all I wanted to lose was 10 lbs). I have met other women with similiar results( and they also only wanted to lose a few pounds). I have also met other people who have lost a great deal of weight, although they had a significant amount of weight to lose. I am not sure why this diet works for some, and not for others. I am looking into the Schwarzbein diet, which appears to be more balanced and low carb. I wish Adtkins would do more research !"
5,Great for diabetics,I have been on this diet for 4 weeks now and I have lost 10 pounds. The weight loss is a bonus to me as the real benefit is in my desease. I have been diabetic since I was 25 and have fasting glucose levels on 300+ in the morning. I was taking 20 units of insulin a day. On this diet I am normal. I do not need insulin even though I check my blood sugar every day to make sure I stay normal from 300+ to 85-120 that is a reality folks. It works for me. Also my blood pressure which was a bit high has dropped off to normal as well. I highly recommend this diet.
1,Stick to the original,"I didn't care for the revised version at all. The original version is still better. I've lost 42 pounds so far and kept them off for three years to date. The ""new"" version gives you too many ways to cheat, in my opinion, and is therefore less effective. My husband's cardiologist actually recommended Atkins when we asked for his opinion of what was most effective."
4,Excellent knowledge to impart,"I was never aware of this low carb/high protein concept until I read this book. Howevr I'm a liitle afraid on getting on this diet due to 2 concerns of my mine. First I'm trying to get pregnant. What if I lose all the 40 lbs I'm trying to lose. Then I do get pregnant. And we are not allowed to restrict or go on a diet during pregnancy. I'm concerned of gaining all or maybe more lbs of all that I lose. The other worry is I do not eat meat on certain days of the week. The diet suggests mainly meat and eggs. What can I eat on those days, especially vegetarian and at same time fill full. i'm little concerned about giving up all my favorite foods like rice, potatoes, fruits, etc.. Does that mean we need to sacrifice this for life and NEVER eat these foods again. Can someone please write to me and motivate me."
4,Easiest diet in the world,"I have known about this diet over the years and have used it to knock off weight from time to time. Like anything else, sticking to it is mostly a mindset, but this one WORKS. I started seriously after Thanksgiving of last year, and stayed on it through the New Year, (except for Christmas dinner and New Year's Eve). Just not eating all that Christmas stuff was a help to not gain a bunch of weight. At the end of two months I had lost 25 pounds and was getting compliments all day long. Easy to stay on and keep the diet at restaurants, etc. Good luck! (Now all these people where I work are doing the diet because they see the results a few of us have had on it.)"
3,"Good, but fundamentalists have rights, too.","While the authors tell many scary stories about fundamentalists, they consistently forget that even fundamentalists have the right to ""peaceably petition"" for changes they want. They can't seem to differentiate between extra-legal and unlawful fundamentalist activities, military men whose first loyalty is to their version of Christianity rather than the Constitution, and political movements that are perfectly legal and above-board.It's a useful source, but very one-sided. And I don't like fundamentalists, either."
4,real history with a story,a very short novel that describes the common man's life on the boarder between france and spain in the mid sixteenth century. in addition a good story that the movie sommersby was based on.
3,Bought this CD for one song...,"It wasn't available yet on any mp3 online service yet. So I had to bite the bullet and get the whole cd.The one song is ""bip bob bip"". A fun wild song typical of that era's music. The rest of the cd, not so much. one or two of the other songs are okay, but not all that representative of that era's music."
5,rules!,"this book (and the clothes and kids in it) rules the earth. can i move to japan please? great photos, great fashion, great little bits about the people's current obsessions. did anyone notice that picture of the college student (18) with the blue jogging coat, b&w umbrella, and radioactive shirt appears on two different pages? just an observation. get this book."
2,not anymore,"they dont exist anymore!if you go to Shinjyuku, Aoyama,or anywhere except Harajyuku, you willmeet "" normal people"". they are onlya part of japanese teens.i lived in japan for my entire life andi have never dressed like them.dont get us wrong!"
5,Pretty Clothes,"Beautiful, colourful pictures of Japanese street-fashion. The only draw-back, in my popinion is the listings of brand names and details of the clothing for each picture, it kind of disrupts the visual experience."
4,Excellent,"Forget for a second about the new age, self-help lyrics Francis Dunnery thorws-- though they are very good. Let't Go Do What Happens is filled with great music.Basically rock songs, the album is rich with grinding guitars, thick synthasizers, and brass that alternates between jazz and soul. Dunnery's music is not particually complex, but is textured, layred, and most important, genuine. He is a rocker, but one who can make his rock swing, loop and happily hollar. There is not a ballad on here, but these cookers have the melody and bouyancy of the best pop.Look at the cover, and you can tell Dunnery is an eccentric who does not give a witt about what you think of him, but you can't help but love the nutty optimism he exudes here.Great album"
5,Great product,Great fit for my 2005 Chevy Malibu. Totally satisfied! Would recommend this item to anyone who is need with my type of vehicle. Took only about a 10 days to receive and I'm in Germany.
4,Works perfectly on my 2007 Mazda5,"Bought this to replace a broken OEM mirror on my 2007 Mazda5 GT. It fits perfectly, and is larger than the original. No complaints at all."
1,Cheap -- twice defective,"First received was broken, mounting stem was snapped off. Replacement received, day/night actuator did not work. Returned second item for refund, will not be using CIPA brand in the future."
5,Informative,This book has lots of good info for people struggling to find answers about TS. Not much else to say.
3,Anthony T. Potter,"Very sturdy product. Timely delivery. Only problem, 17 inch monitor doesn't fit properly into the finger-like projection area of the case."
1,Horrible Software,"This is the most frustrating, worthless software I've ever purchased. Spent an incredible amount of time trying to make a single label and the software locks up continuously and you cannot open saved files, much less print them.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
4,Wonderful toy for the price,"Not everyone may agree with me, but I think this is a great toy for the price. The detail is so incredibly well done and the coloring is great (no smudges or paint color where it shouldn't be). This was given to a little boy to play with and add to his collection. I think it is a great addition to anyone who is looking to get a more nontraditional depiction of a dinosaur."
2,product information is deceiving,"It says 5"" Tall. NOT TRUE. It is just 3"". It is tiny. I cant use it for my son's project.Too bad. It is a well done figure."
1,A poopy album,"I have been and always will be a huge ELO fan. After a tremendous run of artistic and commercial success with ELO, ELO 2, On The Third Day, Eldorado, Face The Music, A New World Record and Out of the Blue ELO pushes their credibility off a cliff with this pop, disco trash. I remember how betrayed and disappointed I was when I first heard ""Shine a Little Love"". This album marked the end of ELO for me. While almost returning to form with 1981's TIME (ELO with no string section? Bah!)ELO, beginning with Discovery began a long slow descent into rubbish with its weakest songwriting and bad sounding records. Lynne would soon redeem himself with the absolutely incredible Traveling Wilburys and would go on to have phenomonal success as a record producer throughout the 90s and 2000's.The only thing I like about Discovery is the album artwork."
3,ELO's Commercial Peak,"ELO hit their sales peak with the massive hit ""Don't Bring Me Down,"" from the album ""Discovery."" And while the song is one of their best, the album it is drawn from is inconsistant at best. Other songs that stand out include the catchy ""Last Train to London,"" ""Shine a Little Love,"" and ""Confusion,"" all worthy follow ups to ""Don't Bring Me Down."" The rest is a peculiar mixed bag of filler material including the really awful ""The Diary of Horace Wimp,"" which represents leader Jeff Lynne's songwriting at its most theatrically horrid. Note that the best songs here are also available on ELO's various anthology albums.Overall, an uneven album that contains from very good songs."
2,Your 8-year-old sister will love this...,"If disco had been nipping at ELO's heels on 1977's ""Out of the Blue"", this is where it caught up and ripped them to shreds. The album is virtually unlistenable, save for three tracks: the hard-rocking ""Don't Bring Me Down"", the humorously wistful ""Diary of Horace Wimp"", and the upbeat and atypically straightforward ""On the Run"". If only Jeff Lynne had used his powers for good... Of course, it was a huge hit."
5,Don't bring this one down,"I was listening to Kasey Casem top 40 flashback and he mentioned that Fleetwood Mac and Huey Lewis were the only groups up to that time to have 4 top 10's by a group on one album.Actually this album had four top tens on the Uk chart.I guess he was referring to the US Billboard charts.I really like this album.the covers cool,the production isn't as layered and the tunes show a great craftsman at work.The big one is Don't Bring Me Down,but Confusion,Shine a Little Love and Last Train are equally as good.I thought the On the Run demo had potential as a completely different version to be released in full.Jeff really like the 50's style music and he sounds great doing the Del Shannon tune.I wouldn't mind an album like this from Jeff.I put this in my top 5 ELO's."
5,Excellent,"For me good, very excellent the book most complete of fish. Recomento for that they want a complete book, with simple texts, direct and photos."
4,Out-dated but still valid.,"This book is great for a wholesaler or store, or someone who is doing field research. But as someone who is trying to create a catalog of up-to-date species listings, it is lacking updates from older editions. Pictures of preserved specimens are used, that were used in older editions, and living specimens are readily available. But the index is well written in three forms that may need updates of the common names in the next edition maybe?"
1,outdated,most of the photos are old and not very nice - missing are common names and explanation for each genus of common features - behaviour...I don't reco.
4,Good enough....,"I thought this book was good enough for those of us with ok credit. If your credit cards accounts have gone to collections, this book explains the process and walks you through the process of getting those collection accounts erased. It is great for those that have delinquencies and other minor credit violations. I wouldn't recommend it for those with bankruptcies and repos. Good book with good sample letters."
1,It's cheap for a reason!,"I've read 5 books on ""Credit Repair"" and the methods in this one are simply NOT the best methods to deal with the credit bureaus, and could even make your situation wose if you followed these guidelines because they will throw up ""Red Flags"" with the credit bureaus and you will likely find your disputes ignored or rejected as ""frivilous"". I HAD absolutly terrible credit, but I've been very successful in 'repairing' my credit, but I didn't learn it from this book! I'll refrain from making any suggestions of other books because there are lots of good books out there on ths subject. I recommend looking at some of the others."
4,Good Book Overall & Helpful,"I thought this book was very helpful. While it wasn't as in-depth as I expected (which is not necessarily a good thing) its attack to a very serious problem and methods of approach were very useful for me. I would definitely recommend this book to others who need help from their credit problems. As long as you don't think that this will be a quick solution to your problems (it took a year of hard work to clean up my credit report), you will be pleased at the end of the process.BTW, I don't know what these two other bafoons are saying online when they say the author preaches religion to you (I did not see one reference to God) and nor do I see where the author says to stay away from banks with a 'C' in their name. I think they're just 14 year old punks with nothing better to do.Good Luck!"
2,myspace.com/barropanama,"i had to take a lot of time cutting a schnauzers hair. and the same thing for two himalayans. i didnt notice this clipper was not advanced or pro, my bad, though/.chao, BARRO. COMBATE Fight Club. [...]"
1,Failed to perform,"We bought this product new. On its initial use, this product ran well, but failed to remove pet hair, meaning that it does not perform the task it was intended to do. We have a shih-tzu, and have used various clippers on her over the years. This product did not clip the hair at all, and we found that even after removing the length guard and holding the hair up between our fingers, the clippers made no effort to cut. This product fails in every important respect. We would have taken it back to the store, but became so frustrated with it that I destroyed it. I'm sending the broken pieces to Wahl with a very nasty letter. No more Wahl products for us."
1,Keep a sick-bag near,A classic example of US quasi-religious pop psychology 'let's all get out of the box Brad and run a great company together'. Dreadful - you could drive a bus sideways through its basic principles and psychological flaws. If you're not from the US the last two pages will reacquaint you with whatever you last ate in double-quick time. Scary to see (apart from Stephen Covey)supposedly sane people endorse it. Truly a classic of its genre - so bad it's a treat!
4,Insightful!,"Members of the Arbinger Institute have written an important book that has the potential to change the way you think, behave, and live your life, both personally and professionally. This book simply and effectively addresses a core problem in human nature: self-deception. Presented as a series of conversations between two businessmen, one acting as a mentor to the other, the book walks you through the kinds of events that put you ""in the box"" of self-deception. Then, the book explains how you can get out of the box and, just as importantly, explains how to avoid getting stuck in the box in the first place. The authors believe that self-deception is at the root of all conflict and lack of productivity. For that reason, we at ... recommend this book to all who are concerned about human motivation."
4,Excellent Book,This book really made me take a look at myself. As you are reading it you can see yourself in the situations. This book gives you an insight as to why colleagues or employees react to you the way they do. It's because we decieve ourselves into believing what we want to believe. This is a must read for any manager who wants to develop a stronger team and better relationship with employees.
5,Great book at a great price,"This book is wonderful. It teaches an important life lesson that we can all relate to, regardless of if we're in the business world or not. I highly recommend it. It was worth every penny. Also it arrived early and was in perfect condition. Everything about it deserves 5 stars."
5,CAN'T GET ENOUGH!!,"My husband caught excerpts of this book on-line and got so ""hooked"" on it, he could not wait for the next chapter to appear, so he special ordered two copies ""for the office"", sharing one with his boss and co-workers (and me!) and giving the other one to the Plant Manager with his very high recommendations. I am glad to see that it is available for a discounted price from Amazon because I want to give some away -- one to my 24-year old son, for sure! Anyone who cannot find something in this book that changes their lives for the better -- be it personal, spiritual, or professional, is NOT OPEN TO IMPROVING THEMSELVES AND (to quote the book) ""IN THE BOX!"" -- Julie Lowe"
4,Leadership and Self Deception,"This is a companion to The Anatomy of Peace, but addresses work relationships, as well as touches on personal relationships. Can be read without reading ""Anatomy"", but is harder to understand the full concept. Great book, however, and very easy to read. Everyone should be familiar with what is inside. Changes lives for the better."
2,Incredulous!,"If I had read one of the other reviews more carefully, I wouldn't have been DUMBFOUNDED to discover that the leveling screws were not included with the insert!!! Does Jet expect the user to remove the screws from the saw insert each time dado blades are used and then return them back to the saw insert when done? Unbelievable!"
4,shaping foam,I was recommended by my hair stylist and I purchased it online. I like it. It shapes it while you can manage your hair.
1,This one is a loser.,"I read all the reviews at Amazon.com on this item and still did not believe that the HTC mobile base could be as bad as some folks say it is. After receiving it, I can say that the reviews were right. Without leveling bolts, the base is useless and the wheel lock-downs are made of cheep materials. The base can be unstable on uneven floors. I stood on the center rail that holds the extended table and my 155 Lb weigth caused the base to sag. This was before the saw was placed on it. HTC said I have 30 days to return it with no questions asked. I would except that I invested [money] and two days to beef it up and put levelers on the thing..."
3,mobile base review,"I purchased this mobile base for my jet table saw with router extension table. This was a bosch promo kit that included the router and router cabinet with two shelves. It was a little unclear as to whether this base would fit, but with the ajustability of the base it was no problem. I believe this is a mediocre base, with a very good value. I have a relatively level floor to roll upon, this was very important as the wheels will come to a stop trying to go over the smallest of obstacles. All in all a good value, but not the best out there."
3,A good adaptation of Rosamunde Pilcher book,This a long movie but a good adaptation of the Rosamunde Pilcherbook. The countryside is beautiful and the architecture is wonderful.Watch it in sequels!!!!!!!!I liked it............
3,There must be several different versions out.,"This is certainly not the record I own from childhood. My copy is a 20th Century Fox release from 1963 and includes thirty-one songs on nine tracks -- including the ravishing ""Villancico"" and ""Lo, how a rose e'er blooming"", which are not on this CD.It always struck me as a bit kitschy, and I still have no idea why my mother bought it as she took a very dim view of made-up apocrypha like ""The Little Drummer Boy"". However, it does contain some rarities and unusual material. You won't hear ""Masters In The Hall"" on the Muzaks in the mall! This is still the only recording of ""Villancico"" that I have ever heard. Why isn't the original recording released on CD? Legalities?"
5,Available for download,"This is one of my 3 favorite Christmas albums of all time, with Bing's ""Merry Christmas"" (now titled ""White Christmas""), and Ray Conniff's ""Christmas With Conniff"". I was able to find this album for download on a music site run by a piece of fruit (hint hint). I hadn't heard it in years, and it brings back so many memories. It's all I've been playing this week!"
5,One great Christmas Album,This is an excellant holiday recording. I remember when my mom and dad got the record from Kapp records and I always loved it. It has the best rendition of T'was the Night Before Christmas I have ever heard.
3,Good 80's horror flick (1 of them is).,"""Trick or Treat"" is a fun movie for those who like heavy metal from the 1980's. I would say it's a cult classic. The other movie is a low budget flick that is not good. Totally worth it for one movie."
2,Faulty Design,"I feel compelled to review this product. The plastic brush does not lock onto the handle. I called Braun and discussed this with a customer relations rep. She got a sample of it and responded that she ""sees what I am talking about"". I had a previous model that was also Braun and it worked just fine for years until it finally gave out. Other than just having to be really careful that I hold the wand ""just so"" so that it does not fall off, it works fine."
4,Great for a book group,"If you thought Cold Mountain was a good story, you'll like On the Occasion of My Last Afternoon for different reasons. Whereas Mountain was a love story, Occasion is one woman's story. Easy read, believable, entertaining. A good choice for a book group--mine gave it a thumb's up."
3,"Literate, well-researched, interesting story","The author made the setting come alive by the inclusion of details such as the medical treatment in use at the time and the unique figures of speech and dialect. The story moves along well enough to keep your interest. I did think that both Quincy and Clarice were too good to be true, and that Emma's father was too awful...As this was my first Kaye Gibbons novel, I can't compare it to her other books, but I don't feel like I wasted my time reading it."
2,Two Dimensional,"I was lured into buying this book by an enticing review calling it ""better than 'Gone With the Wind.'"" I should have known that this comparison was hype, and indeed it was. Both the plot and the characters were extremely two-dimensional and predictable. The heroine and her sainted husband (not to mention her dastardly father) were just too much. It was difficult to feel any of the emotions the author obviously wanted to evoke because the whole thing seemed a bit too hackneyed. Want a great Civil War book? Get the real thing--GWTW. This is only a weak imitation."
5,Why I'll never write a book.,Who can compare with Kaye Gibbons? This book was excellent as well it should be coming from one of the true great novelists of America. How sad for me. :)
3,Dark Story but a Good Message,"On the Occasion of My Last Afternoon is a novel that explores the deep roots of our country and our families. Part of this novel reminds us of the dark past our nation has come from, times of slavery and the horrors of the civil war. The other piece to this novel reflects on how our childhoods shape who we become, both good and bad. The narrator, recalling her life as she approaches the end of it, recalls for us her terrible childhood, raised by an overbearing and horrendous father who left permanent scars on her psyche. My only complaint with the story is that it seems there is one devastating blow after another and yet for some unfortunate souls, this is life. The lessons to take away from the novel make it worth the read. When you're on your death bed and reflecting upon your life, will you be glad you drove the nicest car and had the finest of treasures? Or will your treasures be the upright and moral life you lived and the way you touched others?"
4,audio book,"I strongly suggest getting the audio version of this book, if traveling is in your future. It is wonderfully narrated by Polly Holliday (Flo on the TV sitcom Alice). Her talents as a storyteller exceeded my expectations from her infamous line ""kiss my grits"" on Alice. The book is very entertaining, and her ability to develop distinct voices for the many characters in the book is unmatched."
2,On the Occasion of My Last Afternoon,This book was highly recommended to me and it was a big disappointment. I found it difficult to follow the timeline. The writer drifted in the story much like someone distracted in thought; following remotely related tangents and abruptly return to a different part of the story. I felt I barely got to know the characters save the narrator and even then did not feel much connection or empathy for her.
4,All Women need to read and take heed...,"First off, let's congratulate this upcoming ""New Writer"". Becoming a writer is not an easy task; however, my hat's off to all that ventures out to become an inspiring writer. I really enjoyed reading this book and how the author acquainted me with each of the characters. This book had an interesting twist, which left me feeling empty and without words. In addition, this book confirmed many beliefs about relationships and the things that can and will happen in relationships. I'm looking forward to reading many more books by this author. My only recommendation to the author is to continue keeping it real."
4,Yum?,"I quite liked it, the flavor is a bit harsh at first but then it becomes more mellow. It is most certainly caffeinated which is good. It is too expensive to buy more than once though. All in all I liked it."
1,Definitely one to avoid,"Despite being credited to ""Lightnin' Hopkins & Friends"" only two of the eight tracks on this album feature Lightnin', and they are ""Back In My Mother's Arms"" and ""Chicken Minnie.""The other six tracks definitely do not involve Lightnin' Hopkins in any way. ""John Hardy"" and ""Goodnight Irene"" are Leadbelly recordings made for Moses Asch in 1943, while ""One Meat Ball"" and ""Sorrow To My Heart"" are 1944 recordings by Josh White. The other two -- ""Chicka Choca Shalali"" and ""Blow Out The Candle"" are by a white performer who apparently worked under the name of ""Irish O'Malley.""What a rip-off!This material, together with that on the other four ""Lost Texas Tapes"" albums, more recently appeared on the Koch 2-CD setThe Little Darlin' Sound of Lightnin' Hopkins: Lightnin' Strikes Twice(see my review there). Another one to avoid!"
5,"Bring The Color Gold, Bring Photos of Personal Saints...","After viewing Allan Cohen's slide show history on the ""Haight-Ashbury in the 60s"" CD-Rom, I decided to buy the SF Oracle Facsimile Edition. It is a beautifully crafted treasure trove, which allows you to go back in time and revisit the days of Haight-Ashbury in its purest form, from the point of view of the artists and mystics of the day.Though I was only 12 years old during the Summer of Love, I used to shop on Haight Street until one day I was told I couldn't go down there anymore because of the Hippies. Of course I went anyway, and became hooked on the colorful posters and music. Let this book be your guide to a really interesting time in our history."
3,Our cats snubbed it,"What more can I say? This seemed a bit small and feeble and our cats laughed at it. In our case, it was a waste of money. Your cats may love it but ours turned up their tiny noses and walked away."
3,Poor Customer Service,"I've been having problems ordering things from Amazon that need to be delivered by FedEx or CEVA. You've taken down the wrong phone number, and I've had to contact you 9 times in an attempt to correct yet - but for some reason you seem incapable of taking the right information, then sharing it with shippers. It's kind of astounding."
3,Worried about support,"I love the looks and the versatility of this lounge sofa, but I'm a little worried about the support - it doesn't appear to have any except for the all weather wicker fibers. I figured there would be some sort of slat support system. I hope it lasts a while. We'll see. I may go get some sheet metal to fit between the cushion and the wicker."
1,Very disapointing,"I've studied and drawn fashion illustrations for more than 20 years. I'm familier with the history, the artists, and the techniques of this genre.Most fashion illustrations serve the purpose of either selling clothes or giving directions to people actually making the garments. Short of that, they've been used to present a fashionable illusion for p.r.I'm not sure what purpose of the often very abstract illustrations in this book are supposed to serve. They aren't glamorous. They aren't drawn well enough to sell or direct in the creation of garments. Perhaps they were intended as decorative illustrations at either point-of-purchase locations or on websites.Either way, I found the enclosed illustrations lacking in imagination, verve, and technical skill. This is the first book I've ever returned to Amazon."
2,retraction of review,"I regret that I was wrong in my review of this book. I made a hasty decision based on misinformation that I received from other sources, which I no longer trust.I now place all trust in Roger Mason. Please see my new review of Sept 25, 2002Elwin Bagleybcsbagley@aol.com"
2,Didn't even finish,"I don't what the problem was because with all of the great reviews I should have liked this book, but I couldn't get thru it. I tried several times but for some reason the characters did not grab me enough to make me care what happened. It's in the bag for the book exchange."
2,disappointed,"Very disappointing book. While it has great photos of Staffies...some of which look very much like my Staffie Sheba...Dr. Fleig has a very superficial grasp of the history of the breed in question, and an astonishing ignorance of related breeds, especially the Pit Bull. Perhaps he should stick to German breeds, and leave the British breeds to someone else."
4,"Unique, fun blocks for hours of play","These blocks are perfect for small babies who are just learning how to stack things together, but are also entertaining for toddlers and pre-schoolers. They are easy to put together because of the bumps on each end. The little animals on each of the blocks are so cute and very cleverly designed. It is also really nice to have the carrying case so you can take them with you. A great toy!"
4,Mystic Chai * Hot or Cold Spiced Tea * From Mystic Beverages * Case...,The taste is superior when mixed with hot milk than with hot water. That's why I gave one star less.
2,Shake the habit,"I found this book very disappointing. A lot of the book was devoted to why sugar is bad for you - over half of the book. Very little was devoted to how to overcome the ""sugar habit."" As a sugar addict I did not find enough ways or enough time spent on the tittle of the book Shake the Habit. Cutting back gradually and eating lots of vegetables just doesn't make it for me."
1,Buy sugar blues or sugarbusters instead,"I'm a biochemist and Ms Appleton's declarations are not based in scientific fact. After the first few chapters I felt I was on a sugar ""witch hunt"". Sugar isn't good for us but it is not the cause of a ""calcium tumor"" in her chest. More facts and less hysteria would have made a better case."
2,Prune Night II,"The original Prom Night was an a-typical, great 80's slasher with fantastic slasher queen Jaimie Lee Curtis.I remember seeing Hello Marylou: Prom Night II when it was first out in 1987. It's much worse now. Prom Night II is a very uninspired and dull horror movie. The acting is all over the place, it just stunk.Prom Night II isn't by any means an enjoyable movie. It does however provide some underwhelming entertainment, that would best be enjoyed with some dead friends."
1,Dont Waste Your Money!,This book is worthless and contains very little information in it. Only 22 pages of big type and lots of photos. I rasie Miniature horses and was planing on giving this book to my first time horse owners- but I'm returning it to Amazon instead. Save your money and try one of the other books on Miniatures!-Lynn Arabian Echo Miniatures
2,Shut Up!!!,"If I hear that phrase one more time I'm going to scream!The character of Elayna says it way to often! But considering she acts like a snotty high school girl I suppose it's appropriate.I expected much more from Cathy Hanauer. This is the first book I've read of hers and I am accutely disapointed. The character behaves like a spoiled brat, ignoring the potential danger that her daughter may be in and drolling over a young man instead of working on her marriage.It's a story that's been told a hundred times before and Cathy Hanauer didn't add anything new. The writing was fine but the story line was a yawn!"
4,Helpful Book For Beginners!,"For someone who has never done transfers, nor tried my hand at ribbon embroidary, I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this new craft was going to be. It's a perfect starter book, and she even has a flower for ""X"" in her ABC alphabet, which is Xeranthemum (Straw Flower). Money well spent for anyone who is looking for instructions on ""how to"" do ribbon embroidary. I am so glad this was my first book, she made it look easy and fun, and it was!"
3,Good for beginners,This is a really good book for beginners. Lots of interesting patterns especially if you want to embroider something for your kids.
1,Not gentle at all...,"Just spent the last day and a half in the restroom. Can't believe they advertise this as 'gentle'. Pay close attention to active ingredient (I wish I had). Magnesium in high dosages will give you the runs, nothing more. If you want to have the runs, buy this product."
4,starts slow,"I picked this book because of the price. I almost put it to the archives. It starts slow but once into a few chapters, I couldnt put it down. I had to see what would happen next. I wish it was a longer book. I really enjoyed it."
4,A very good start to a new fantasy series,"This was a very good, although, in my opinion, not great book. It's does, however, bode well for the series. I won't delve into the plot, per se, except to highlight what I feel to be the author's strong point(s). Namely, his inter-character dialogue and plot-pacing. He does not, for good or ill, spend quantities of space detailing places, or even people. Rather, as an 'impressionist', he merely outlines them and allows the mind's eye of each reader to fill in the rest. This is markedly different then, say, Jordan or Martin (to whom this author/book is most frequently compared).In closing, I will state that Cazio is a 5 '*' character. I looked forward to reading his section(s) as I have few others in recent memory. Frequently, I found myself laughing at loud. Excellent! Beyond excellent: fantastic!"
4,"Very good, almost 5 stars.","The Briar King is a very good start to what I hope to be be an equally good series. The story moves at a quick pace, and leaves alot of the details to your imagination, wich is preferable to me rather than write on and on about a persons clothing or food. The chapters are fairly short wich leaves the reader jumping around from character to character and building up a good feeling of tension among the many storylines converging together. I loved the fact that Keyes isnt afraid to kill off characters that you come to like, or save ones who you come to despise. My only complaint, is the names of some of the characters and lands and such are so complicated to read. Some of the names are so alien to my tounge that it distracts from the story. If not for that, this would be a 5 star book. Deffinately worth your time."
3,decent read,"My biggest problem is the editing. I don't know how it presents in Kindle or book form but on the ipod touch, there will be changes in scene with no paragraph break or any indication that there is a shift occurring. Too abrupt, especially considering the plot is fairly slow anyway. It is getting engrossing towards the middle of the book though. I don't know if I will purchase the other books in the series though."
1,could not register item when first ordered,was sent send item (relacement for first copy) however it would not work on my computer either... so it's laying here on the computer desk and i still do not have a windows xp with service pack 2... this item has not been used ...i have recieved no satisfaction or service... unless you would like to take it back one more time i'm really disappointed... sorry... james sanders
1,stupid and ridiculous,why? cause it chokes up PROCESSING and RAM that's why! its full of bugs and freezes frequently. [...]if you want stability get win2000. its ridiculous how they keep releasing new operating systems every year. XP = Xtra Problem.
2,Upgrade from Win 98 to XP,I loaded the upgrade with no problems but my RAM was not adequate to run the program and it corrupted my hard drive. I had to go thru the recovery process and lost all my files. I ended up buying a new computer with Vista and now none of the 98 programs work. I should have left my 98 windows alone.
4,I wish I had upgraded sooner,Now that XP is obsolete I have finally upgraded to it and wish I had done it sooner. Everything runs better with it. (I was running Windows ME before) There were a few glitches but I got a notice from XP with the problems I might find after the upgrade and the how to's to fix them. All in all I am very happy with the product and Amazon.com
3,"For rebuilding a friend's old laptop, this is exactly what was needed.","Windows XP became the standard operating system used on most PCs and Laptops for roughly 8 years. It was relatively easy to use, and it worked on many devices. It had its share of problems, mainly its susceptibility to viruses, but with good antivirus software, and smart Internet browsing, this generally was not a problem. If you are rebuilding an old system, I would suggest a dual-booted Windows XP and Linux Distribution setup. This way, you get the ability to play all of the those programs designed for XP, while at the same time having the backup Linux system, in case something goes wrong and you have to fix the Operating System from the outside."
1,CRAP,"this is the worst operating system ever. It is worth at most 20$, not 100$. If you can afford this, you might as well buy windows 7."
1,Blew up my computer,"After reading all the cautions and warnings, I determined that my machine was powerful enough to handle this upgrade. The new OS worked for about 2 weeks, though it was very slow. About two weeks after installation, the computer crashed and I found that I had one long file on my hard drive that contained about 12-14 gigs of data. At the very least, my hard drive had to wiped and reformatted. Thank you so much, Microsoft!I am in the process of having a new hard drive installed and my RAM upgraded. Don't believe the minimum requirements that the package provides. You need some power and at least 1024 MB of RAM."
3,Unable to install,I could not install this product because the version of XP that was on my computer was newer than the product that I was trying to install.
2,Raptor,"I read a book called raptor recently. This book is about dinosoars invading a Calorado town because the main character's dad made an archaelogical discovery. The raptors kill many people and put Zach's father into a coma. With Zachs dads last words he said ""Find out why.""Zach found a raptor nest but found a dinosoar bigger and stronger then a T-rex... The suspense in this book is ok and the story is alright aswell; if you like dinosoars pick this book up but if you dont i dont recomend Raptor. On a scale from one to ten ten being the highest i give this book a 5."
4,fulfis expectations,This product is well made and does what I needed - holding boots outside my apartment door. It was at a really good price too.
4,Tired of Cleaning Carpets!!,"It's exactly as pictured, however I wished I would have done my research on it b/c its a lighter plastic and I was hoping for something a little heavier so it would stay in place. I have curious cats that like to use it as a slip and slide and the only way of keeping it in place is having heavy shoes on it. But overall, definitely serves its purpose and am very pleased."
5,LOVE IT!!!,"So useful that I can't imagine how I never thought before of getting one. It tells me how hot my computer equipment is, and thus when things are getting critical. It tells me how cold drafts are from the windows, and how hot my coffee is. Its very fun, and very cool. I love the laser which tells you precisely what is being measured."
5,like the old fashioned ones,"my mother bought this for a long car trip to the beach and my girls who were both under 6 at the time loved them!!!! a year later they are still playing with them.something i did to make them more durable was cover all the pieces in clear contact paper. i cut the tabs off and used a small amount of the putty used to hang posters on the wall (look where the pencils & pens are at wal-mart) this way, we did not have to deal w the tabs going behind the long hair like the review before mine talks about.plus you dont have worry about these getting too close to a computer like the magnetic ones."
2,disappointing,"Don't be fooled by the cover. The princesses on the cover of this set are in fun dancing poses with swirling gowns. Inside, they're standing in prim little postures with their hands neatly folded, and the dresses are flat and one-dimensional as well. Plus all the dresses are on flimsy paper and can't transfer well between dolls because they're cut so specifically to one shape. Ariel doesn't even come with a fish tail!I gave this two stars only because the dolls of Disney characters themselves are a fun addition to a collection."
1,Defective from the begining,"I just received the Jet Mortise machine yesterday. Took it out of the box, assembled it and plugged it in. At first it wouldn't do anything thing but hum a little. I turned the chuck a little, then turned it back on. It made a horrible grinding sound. Closer inspection revealed the fan on the top of the motor was grinding against the housing. Further inspection of the machine showed the bolt holes in the base were not taped square. These bolt holes attach the column to the base. I'm skeptical how square the machine would cut if the manufacturer cannot machine square bolt holes. This is my first Jet tool and it will be my last. I just ordered a Powermatic to replace this junk."
4,good for the hobbyist,"I've built several projects with this mortiser over the past year. It has done a great job. The stop mechanism works great, it's sturdy, and the chisels that come with it are plenty sharp. I've built about 4 tables with this machine, and I am currently building a cabinetmaker's bench, which requires me to bore mortises about 3 inches deep. Since I am using poplar for my base it didn't bog down the motor like maple would, however, the base wasn't wide enough to accomodate the large legs. No biggie: Rockler sells an extension table for this model that I am considering buying.I wish they would have included mounting hardware (like my Delta drill press), so that I could mount it without any further trips to the hardware store."
5,Sister Blandina's End of the Santa Fe Trail,"I enjoyed reading The End of the Santa Fe Trail, Sr. Blandina was refreshing in the story as she was writing about her life in the West to her sister in Ohio. The times were rough and yet she survived and brought so much to life in southern Colorado and New Mexico. She was a great woman, I am glad that her book is still in print for all to read. If you a history buff, it is a must read."
5,I hope it is rereleased soon.,"This is a fun, all over workout. You really feel like you have had an aerobic workout plus muscletoning in a reasonable amount of time. I am not a Katie Lee fan, but I love the intervals. I never get bored of doing the same thing over and over. I hope the studie desides to rerelease the video."
1,"I GIVE UP!! I'M SLOW, BUT AFTER 4 UNITS, I'VE LEARNED","The 1st was replaced under wanrranty, the 2nd was just out of warrantee. The 3rd was again just out of warrantee and the design changed for the pumbing which made the 4th unit difficult to install. The 4th unit is now leaking!! What is wrong with this company?The worst part of this is the mess it makes under the counter. I typically do not go looking for a leak under the sink, so when I do find it, it has already made a mess and water soaked the cabinet wood.I quick, there must be another manufacture worth trying!!!!!!"
3,It's not the tank that's leaking,"My two-year-old H770-SS started leaking a few weeks ago and a call to Insinkerator got me a new tank delivered under warranty. After installing the new tank I disassembled the old unit and found that the leak was not from the tank, but from a plastic hose that had been overheated as it was up against the hot tank over a part of its run. I would characterize this as a design or fabrication flaw, likely common to all units built around that time."
1,There are better products available,"If you have very nice cabinets, you won't want to ruin them with this product, the concept is nice but this product leaks after a short time. You spent $15,000 on cabinets and ruin them with this piece of junk you might want to reconsider the purchase. Insinkerator H770ss."
1,What a croc,"Although I loved the convenience of having boiling water at my fingertips, several of these insinkerators have not lasted very long. 2 were replaced under warranty, the third was too expensive to fix, so I replaced it. I decided to buy the top of the line, and it didn't last any longer. Insinkerator replaced the tank at a cost that floored me (service man told me AFTER he replaced the tank that he was going to replace it and how much it would cost) Within months, it went again, but they insisted it was the tap, which would have costed another $300.00 to replace. Now, I could have bought a whole new Insinkerator for the price of replacing the tank, and months later, they want another $300.00 for the tap! Now I boil water in my kettle."
2,Handy product but poorly made or designed.,"My experience is much the same as other reviewers who have gone through two or more InSinkErator hot water dispenser in ten years or less. My first one lasted about 4 years and the second a bit less than 5 years. In both cases the tank leaked, as reported in many other reviews. I would consider going to a different brand, but it appears Emerson Electric manufactures basically all of the brands that are widely available in the U.S. Perhaps I'll investigate the European models to determine if any of them might be more reliable. Otherwise, if you want the convenience of instant hot water at the sink, just expect to replace the unit every few years."
2,Not as great as advertised,"I built a sectional out of the different pieces sold by Strathwood from their Camano line. The sectional sits too low from the ground and, moreover, unless you are planning on spending some money on additional pillows, it is too deep and, as such, very uncomfortable. Also, the whitish cushions got too dirty too quickly even though this unit sits in a covered patio... Getting each cushion out of each cover was a royal pain as well. The zippers do not go all the way around so maneuvering the cushions in and out of the covers was difficult. Would not necessarily recommend."
3,60 Zanies Furry Rattling Rainbow Mice,mice are well done and cat's enjoy to play. I will buy more of those mice they are awsome.
1,"Cat Loves them, but I had to throw them away","My cat LOVES mice that rattle. For that these were great mice. They rattled very well. The mice have a couple problems though. First, their tails come off within about a minute of playing. Many of the mice barely have the skins attached too. Those aren't the reasons that I decided to throw them away.One of the ways that my cat plays with her mice, is that she loves to try to drown them in her water dish. Although I didn't notice with the first one that we gave her (a yellow one), the next one (a red one) turned the water bright red overnight. I was very concerned that they would drink the dyed water or even worse... she would ingest the dye off of the mice. So they were tossed."
3,Full disclosure necessary,"Another reviewer noted that these ""mice"" are covered in ""real fur,"" and that this should have been noted in the product description. I feel like i already knew this, so I don't feel strongly about it, but I do think it's indicative of a more general problem here. I would also have preferred, for example, to know that the product is manufactured in China, given Chinese companies' spotty records with pet (and other) product safety in the recent past. I think this is a pretty good deal, overall, and the cats like the toys, but transparency re: country and factory of origin, materials/ingredients included, etc., is really important. $$$ = votes. When I buy something, I am voting for more of it to be manufactured. The more information available re: the conditions of its production the better."
4,Fun adventure & adaptable,Nice forest adventure easily adapatble to almost any fantasy RPG campaign.
3,caveat emptor!,"the product is great- i love the kitsch value and it arrived (eventually) exactly as represented. the company? that's a different story. i'm just going to say i wouldn't order from this company again if my life depended on it. their ""customer service"" department is seemingly just a front for bitter people to work out their inferiority complexes through sarcasm. doubt me? read through some of the negative posts and take note of the company's replies back to their CUSTOMERS who are simply looking for answers. if you don't have to deal with customer service, though, you'll probably be fine."
3,good device. not as fas as dlink,"the unit operates as stated. however, it appears to be considerably slower than a similar unit from dlink. looks good, if you care about that stuff."
4,Lovely Book!,I enjoyed this book very much. Nicholas Sparks puts us in situations we can relate to. There are moments when you feel your relationship is running dry and you don't know how to rekindle it. Romantic and sweet. Made me cry. Great sequel to The Notebook but The Notebook is still a lot better.
5,I loved this book!!,"It has been a while since i read it, but i love the story, the writing, everything. Please read this book...it is a wonderful story!"
4,Good!,"If you enjoyed this book, you will also like: Tuesdays with Morrie: An Old Man, a Young Man, and Life's Greatest Lesson.It has a similar ""lesson"" to it.Enjoy your readings!"
1,The Wedding,"I found this book so boring that I did not finish reading it. It would be impossible for me to write 20 words about it. I bought it as the sequal to The Notebook which I also did not find impressive, although I did read the whole thing. I would not recommend either book to anyone unless they need something to help them sleep. I have read other books by Nicholas Sparks and found them quite entertaining."
5,I loved this book,"When i found this book, i didn't realize it was part of the note book. that was a great book and movie too. this book really hit home for me, i am in the same boat right now. i really felt connected with the characters in the book. i may have to read it again."
1,"Simplistic, shallow and poorly written","I borrow each NS book from the library and each one is worse than the last. But what they taught me is that ""story is king."" His characters are always perfect and leave me completely cold. In fact, I can't force myself to care about the characters and continue to read waiting to see if NS has learned anything. The screenwriters do a wonderful job with the books by adding depth and personality to the characters. Actually, the movies rarely follow the original story. An NS book is as satisfying as a soda cracker would be to a starving man."
1,Boring... Boring... Boring...,"I think this author's books are full of fluff and too predictable. I've read a few (The Notebook and A Walk to Remember), listened to a few on cd (The Rescue, Message in a bottle and The Wedding) and I have been bored to tears.I think it's about time to give up on any good material to read from Sparks.I'll wait till movie versions come out. They are usually edited of all the boring elements and given a better ending than the books. Probably because the screenplay is written by someone other than Sparks."
1,A bad self-help book for warped marriages,"The writing is atrocious from the acknowledgments to the prologue to the opening chapters. Sparks lacks style and substance. I have disliked some bestsellers before, but I can't remember any with fewer saving graces then this one.This tome can only seem exciting to the personality-disabled."
5,Wonderful!,I couldn't put it down! I loved every minute of it and would recommend it to everyone I know! Excellent book!
4,Kendal's review,"I liked the book because it was very interesting throughout the whole book. I never knew what was going to happen next. The ending surprised me. My prediction was different than what happened. . Wilson's wife, Jane, is thinking about leaving him after he spends way too much time at his office and not enough time at home. Their daughter,Anna is gettting married and Jane is thinking about leaving him a few days after the wedding.I would recommend this book to a about twelve and up,because, it's a thick book but, not too thick but also not an easy book. Also the subject of the book is good for ages twelve and up because, ages younger than twelve might not understand the book.It was perfect for me and you really got to understand what's going on to understand the book."
4,What a romantic summer read!,"This book was a lot more realistic than the other Nicholas Sparks books, but just as nostalgic and endearing. I absolutely fell in love with the characters, whom Sparks paints so beautifully you will swear you know them. I found myself crying at random times during the book.Though The Wedding is a sentimental, romantic read, it also has that punch of reality that will leave readers thirsting for more. The only complaint I have with this book is that there are moments of repetition that seem pointless. However, the pace and the ease of the rest of the prose make up for it."
5,A wedding of great writing and heart,"The Notebook and The Bark of the Dogwood are two of my all-time favorite books. Now, add The Wedding to that list. I plan to read ever Nicholas Sparks book there is since I haven't gotten a bad one yet! The Wedding is a wonderful and moving novel. It reminds the reader to not take familiar relationships for granted and to treasure each moment together. Highly recommended!"
1,Boring read,"I have no idea how this author sold this boring fairy tale. It was the sappiest, most umimaginative so-called romance I have ever had the misfortune to read."
1,The Magic Formula,"Nicholas Sparks captured the world's attention with The Notebook. It was an ambitious plot filled with sentiment that reminded one of the great love story, ""Bridges of Madison County."" Since that debut, each novelette has been a rapid repeat of the one before. The Wedding is a halfhearted attempt to tap into the popularity of The Notebook with the hope that it might act as a sequel until he can find yet another outlet for his Harlequin-style prose. One has to admire him...he knows from whence the money comes."
2,disappointed,"I am collecting all of the nicholas sparks' books in hardcover, with slip covers. This book was much smaller and not the style or size (with the slip cover) that I expected. when I veiwed photos of this product it showed it was the book that has the slip cover to it. So I was very disappointed when I recived this book that it in fact was not the style I am collecting. I shall continue my search.."
2,a big disappointment,"I loved the notebook! The wedding is simply predictable, somewhat boring. I will think twice before buying another Sparks book."
2,"Way too gooey, sappy, lovesick romantic for my tastes","I could not get into this book... around page 85 I started speed reading. This book is so overly sentimental. Admittedly I am not a big romantic type so this book may appeal to some, but it definitely wasn't for me."
5,A Heartwarming Adventure,Many of us are so wrapped up in our careers that we often just let life pass us by. This book will cause you to reflect on the lost moments and help you to live life to the fullest. What a beautiful love story
3,the wedding,"Story was just OK. I predicted halfway through the book what the whole ending was going to be. Very short story. Good if you are looking for an easy beach read or something...however not a great novel. DEFINITELY not as good as his other stories, or the prequel to The Wedding...The Notebook. If you have not read the Notebook, read that first. It plays a big part in this story."
3,Floor mats,"Good looking floor mats. The bad thing if the smell it's hard to describe. Wash them well and leave them out side when you get them. The smell will go away. When you first open the box wow, the smell hits you. Make you wonder if you even want to put them in your car."
5,great machine,Setup was easy and fast. The disc table 90 degree was right on out of the box. This sucker can hog off wood at incredible rates without bogging down. It is very fast and accurate. I would highly recommend it to anyone
3,EARLY WORK,SAVE YOUR $. GET I'M STARVING. SAME MATERIAL IN BOTH CD'S. STARVING IS LATER IN HIS CAREER AND MUCH BETTER.
2,"Buy ""I'm Starvin""","the jokes are exactly the same as in I'm Starvin, but not done half as well. I'm sure if you saw this one first it would be a little funny - but the other dvd is absolutely hilarious. And it's a must buy. So get to it!"
3,just another fat joke but funny,"It does make one laugh, good for all ages, if you dont mind teaching kids that it is okay to make fun of oneself, not make fun of others who are fat -- that is what makes this funny. I love to laugh at myself and it makes others laugh, but I would not want other's saying the same things ""to"" me."
3,nay nay for nay nay,"I love John Pinette, however I was disappointed w/ this DVD. I own ""I'm Starvin"" also and this DVD is almost w/out exception the exact same from start to finish. It came out prior to ""I'm Starvin"", but the same non the less. If you want to buy one or the other go w/ I'm Starvin, although the material is the same,he has polished is act up and perfected it in the more recent years. Don't get me wrong, they are both very funny."
4,The 2 DVDs,"John Pinette's jokes are really funny, and both the I SAY NAY NAY and the I'M STARVIN' are great. The problem is they are basically the same. I thought I was buying two DVDs for a good price, but they were the same jokes. Now I'll just be giving the other one to someone else. I had already bought 2 of the I'M STARVIN' so I could give one as a gift."
1,i say nay nay,"i am unable to give a review. the cd never would play on my cd player.i tried it on a different player and it still would did not workcd is defective, with small dots on playing surface"
1,"a lot of easy problems, not enough hard ones","How does one get a 2400 if they practice many easy problems as opposed to difficult ones. There are too many easy problems in this book, which is a waste of time for high acheiving math students."
3,Fast and compelling read,"Even after finishing the book last night, I'm still confused. It was a really quick read, I polished it off in one sitting. But I feel like I missed something. It was a good book except for the fact that I'm still not sure what happened at the end.It's a fairly simple plot. Joanna Eberhart and her family move to the quite town of Stepford. She meets and befriends another woman, Bobbie. While the two of them set out to find other women who might be interested in organizing a womens group, all they can find are women who are interested in staying at home and cleaning the house. Soon, Bobbie and her husband decide to have a second honeymoon. But when she returns, all Bobbie wants to do is houseclean, just like all the other women."
4,Stepford Wives Revisted,Having seen the original film. I wanted to see how the new movie would compare. After reading this novel I have to say I can't wait for the film. I completed the book in one day it was so good.
3,Original but not terribly moving,"A fun morning read of a few thousand words. The men of Stepford are replacing their wives with obedient, sexy robots who love housework. A bit of a satire on men who want such women, but overall, nothing special."
2,The Daniel Easterman struggle,"Daniel Easterman obviously is finding it harder and harder to create intriguing plots that are surreal but yet believable, and totally exciting. His ""the 7th scroll"" is the ultimate masterpiece; mixing X-Files like mystique with Indiana Jones excitement. Unfortunately ""The final judgement"" is a mix of unbelievable characters, plots and coincidences. Its only the fact that Daniel Easterman keeps the action going from page to page, that I did give it a rating higher than 1."
2,Needs better wheels,"I thought I was getting an item with mobile casters but I did not read the description well enough.This item has one caster wheel and two stationary wheels that you have to stop, bend over and tighten a hand bolt to lock. Moving the item around is easy if you have a lot of mobility room but if you have that much room...you don't need the stand. Save your money and look fo a stand with at least 3 mobile wheels and a lift/lower locking type mechanism. Too much trouble to return so I'm going to keep it and eventually put something less needed when I get my permanent shop. Wouldn't buy again and will probably not buy HTC products either."
2,Not Helpful - Except as a Footstool,"I purchased this book for the first part of my Biomechanics class. We raced through the first 10 chapters, and each one was very difficult to understand. Fung skips steps in his derivations which, for an undergraduate, made studying more confusing and time consuming.Probably the most frustrating part (at least for an engineering student) of the text is that none of the equations (except the ones from Chapter 1) are applied to anything. Not even for the problems at the end of each chapter. The book is just a long list of mathematical derivations regarding hypothetical blobs, I mean ""bodies of mass"", in space.In summary, I wish this book had a lot more examples pertaining to applying all the equations written in this book. Perhaps application of these equations will be used in the second part of my Biomechanics class, where we use yet another Fung book. I hope so."
2,"Not helpful, and not original","I find that these stretching exercises exacerbate my back pain. I'm sure that some people might find them helpful, but overall there's nothing to them that couldn't be gained from a good beginning yoga class.The strengthening exercises are essentially Pilates exercises.I wish I hadn't bought this. I was hoping for some kind of new approach."
4,Little Known Funkmeisters!,"If you like bands like Mandrill and early Santana then you'll probably like these guys. Very funky, great organ work & some tight ensemble playing. The only drawback is that their sound becomes a little repetitious which is why I didn't give 5 stars. Overall though ,I highly recommend this disc. Nice grooves abound!"
2,An uninspired effort.,"Well, I have to say this album did not live up to the hype for me. After reading many rave reviews I purchased Drums Not Dead, admittedly on the basis of many of the comparison being made to Faust, Animal Collective and other Kraut-rock bands. I applaud the Liars efforts, as on paper this would seem to be an album I would love but unfortunately, compared to the afore mentioned bands, they come across as amateurish. A 9/10 rating from Pitchfork is laughable. In other reviews that I read much was made of the drumming on this album. I'm not sure why, it's fairly boring and repetitive. The singer sounds like he'd rather be sleeping. The guitar does nothing to warrant attention. Watching the DVD version of the album and seeing one of the band members washing out a bong I was struck by the thought, that if they had spent less time getting high they might have put out an CD that had a few inspired moments."
1,Radio dead,"1 1/2Aside from few fleeting moments of engaging experimentation, the group's sketchy framework exposes a decayed underbelly of creative drought."
3,EXCELLENT BUT OLDER FOOTAGE,"This is an excellent DVD. Casual, non-pretencious and warm and welcoming.The Blu-Ray quality is quite good! Yet keep in mind that the video was often shot as long as 5-6 years ago. You'll see footage with tourists still using pre-Euro money.It was apparently a TV series so the DVD is divided into 4 segments. The Amalfi Coast/Naples segment is the weakest with the Rome segment the best and most accurate. Venice is also excellent.Great DVD. Better than most."
4,"HD is Nice, Narration is Okay","It's more of a guidebook type of video, with actual travel advice. It's not terribly insightful, but it's not annoying either. Fortunately, even if you're not planning a trip to Italy, it's nice to see these amazing locations in HD."
4,great video,nice and funny blu ray videoit is must if you planning to travel to italygood tips and advices
4,Planning a trip to Italy? This disc is one you should get,"I have researched and researched for our upcoming trip to Italy. I bought this blu ray for more of a visual of what I had read so much about. I really enjoyed it. It's a good value and it gave me a few new ideas. Ca'Macana, the mask store in Venice is now on our list of must sees. Of course in this short of time it's impossible to cover everything, but's still pretty concise. It was nice to see St. Clemente, The Bargello, and the mask shop, which are not Must Sees compared to the Colosseum and St Marks. I also enjoyed the tips such as how to ride a bus in Rome and a vaperetto in Venice. It is a bit older since the money used is Lira, but the information presented is still relavent and only the lira gives away the age. More then anything it makes me more excited for my trip."
2,"Functional, but poor quality","There are some distortions as mentioned in previous reviews, and I was able to adapt to it. But 2 months after installing the mirror, the glue from the mirror started melting and dripped all over my car carpet and seats. This item may be good for other parts of the country, but probably not the Southwest (lots of sun)."
2,Not a very good product.,"Ordered a mirror of what was depicted in the photo of the order, sent quite another - oval. That is good - this is a review of the rear view, and this is the only plus. Being in the passenger compartment of the vehicle in hot weather from under the mirror drip glue, he dripped directly on the vehicle. It is terribly. I do not advise to order the model of the mirror."
1,Mirror falls apart when car is hot inside,"Mirror falls apart with vehicle parked outside in 85 degree weather with windows cracked open. The glue they use to hold the mirror plate on assembly becomes ""gooey"" and mirror will not stay on. They probably used glue stick so i removed and used gorilla glue.I recommend not buying this mirror and instead find something better quality. I should not have to rebuild their faulty product."
4,"decent, but not what i ordered","i got the mirror and it was everything i was hoping it would be; except it wasn't what i ordered. what i received was a different type of mirror, and while it does its job as a panoramic mirror, it is still not what i ordered. either way, i love the panoramic mirrors, they work a lot better than standard factory rear-view mirrors."
1,Poor quality,The product looks nice but the glue that holds the mirror in place is oozing out the bottom part where the mirror sits. The outside temp when it happen was about 70 degrees. The glue has oozed out so much that it got onto the steering wheel and shifter. Next time I'll stick with a name brand.
2,"Usable, but just barely!","Thought I would give this a try to help with the blind spots I experience while driving my regular cab truck..... It DID help, but even after using it for a week and a half, I still couldn't judge distance the way I needed to..... There is a real learning curve to using this (as others have said... I'm typically not a slow learner, but this mirror makes everything too small to call it useable.... I ended up hanging this in my office cubicle to see who is slinking up behind me (while I'm writing reviews on Amazon.. :-D)"
1,Awful!,This mirrow is dreadful! It distorts everything it mirrows and somehow reflects more of wht's in the car than the traffic outside of the vehicle. I purchased one for myself and one for four of my children. After attaching mine for a day or two I have taken it and the other four and packed them up to return them from whence they came !
4,Great read,The author produces another great Pitt story that brings all the elements into one action book that has an historical start to the plot.
4,Disjointed album but great songs,I do not have any problem giving this album 4 stars and best of artist title. This would rank 1 in overall album satisfaction with their second album coming in at second. I really liked song 2 since it sounded like early Portishead as well as song 10 and 11. Enjoy.
1,a terrible disappointment,"It's true enough that this album bears almost no relation to other releases by hooverphonic.Unfortunately, the band has shuffled into mediocrity with this release. The only tracks on the album that I can even *remember* are 'Mad About You', a nice and straightforward pop song with some jazzy influences, and 'Renassance Affair', a song from BWPM which they probably included to leverage the popularity of a recent Volkswagen commercial.To call this album anything other than bubble-gum pop would be a stretch. While the band is certainly not stagnating in their past musical space, it's a shame to see them abandon their creative signature sounds in favour of radio-ready ear candy.Anyone who loved the Battersea EP (or even the 'mad about you' EP) will be disappointed by the lack of drum-and-bass and trip-hop influences on this album.I can only hope that the band continues their trend of musical evolution and abandons this vapid style with their next release."
4,Their most listenable yet,"Don't quite know what the agitation is over this album...in my opinion it is entirely more charming and groovy than either of Hooverphonic's first two albums. I really quite like ""Mad About You"" (sounds like a Portishead/Goldfrapp hybrid) and ""Jackie Cane."" This album is a bit more raucous, but after a few listens you'll find that you'll like it."
3,"Not too shabby, but their creativity is waning.","It's not as good as the first two. They are begninning to seep into marginality, and the jazz-swagger of their first two is being replaced by a more conventinal, pop sound that is just boring. I want artist to always be searching for new things, but this seems just too half-reared to be satisfied with. Hopefully Portishead can avoid the same fate."
4,Try it again..,"Planning to see Hooverphonic this weekend (with BT), I dusted off my copy of TMT, purchased the day it was released. Like many HP fans, I'd eagerly awaited it's release, and was totally underwhelmed after several listens. The disc had been relegated to the ""don't play often"" pile in the back of the rack.Well, I'm amazed how much more I like this CD a few weeks later.I won't go into a tiresome track-by-track pseudo-analytical review. As a non-musician, I can only imagine what it must be like to create new musical sounds and ideas. Overall, the disc defies comparision to previous work by Hooverphonic, which is fine by me. I won't attempt to categorize the music, except to say that HP is an incredibly talented band that seems to be exploring their own creative limits, and they are light years beyond most of the indie-pop/trip/whatever groups out there.See you at the show!"
2,The Magnificent nothing,"Who, what, why and how? Can you call this Hooverphonic. It has no similarities to any of their past works. I was so excited to receive this cd and now I can't wait to get rid of it. I almost cried. I needed my fix of Blue Wonder Power Milk and I got the blues instead."
2,pretty blah...,"This is an extremely disappointing effort - even without comparisons to previous work. Sounds more like Madonna than anyone should. ""Autoharp"" is the easy stand out track."
1,Can't get anyone to eat these.,"I bought these for my dachshund, and he wants nothing to do with them. I tried to give them to a friend's dog, and he rejected them as well."
4,Made a good gift,"I never know what to get my brother, but when I thought ""Hey, he enjoys playing the drums on Rock Band"" I went on a search for the perfect, real drumsticks. I did some research and found out this type is best.When he opened this on his birthday he had a smile on his face thats for sure. He tells me that they work great for Rock Band and he loves the grip on these. They also give an awesome look to these toy drums =p"
2,Waste of money..,"These sticks look pretty cool and that's about all they have going for them..The grip part is no easier for me to hold than normal wooden sticks. More importantly, I broke one of the sticks after about a month of normal usage. I normally only buy Vater Los Angeles 5a's and I've had pairs of those last me 2 years before breaking, but decided to give these Zildjians a try..I'll never make that mistake again.."
1,I regret buying this,"Awful, every time I have it on (even if I'm not listing to music) a disturbing sound hurts my ears and give me headaches. I really regret buying this, the only pro is that it looks cool."
2,Not worth the price+shipping.,"I bought these head phones because I read all the reviews that gave it 4's and 5's, so I expected a lot out of them. The truth is you really shouldn't...they don't sound particularly awesome and I was rather disappointed that I actually spent close to $30.00 after shipping and stuff. The mid-highs and highs sound fine, but I had issues with bass and mid-low response, especially when I plugged it into my computer. Plus they are not super comfortable either; the hinges nip at your neck when you don't have them on your head and they fit funny if you have glasses.All in all, I wished i had spent my money on something else. But they do look pretty cool."
3,Not What Im Looking For,"I was extremely disappointed when I got these headphones. Extremely flimsy and when I got them out of the box, they had fingerprints and a bunch of tiny scratches on them. Plus, the photo shows them being red and white, but mine are red and black? But all in all fairly good sound quality, but if you want bass, like me, then I wouldn't recommend these headphones. Also, they are pretty uncomfortable and hurts your ear when you where them for a long time. They are also meant for teens and pre-teens. Not recommended for adults, as they will be uncomfortable and to small for your ears."
3,Plodding right along...,"Classic King overwriting continues to mar what could have been a decent short novel. I daresay it all could have fit in two of these little books had they used a more manageable typeface, instead of this large print.What bothered me most about this installment was the attempts (failed, in my case) to elicit sympathy for Eduard Delacroix. Because he didn't cause much trouble on the Mile and was kind to animals, we're supposed to like him and forget the fact that he burned several people to death in their homes? That's almost offensive. My take: poetic justice comes to the Mile."
4,Wonderful read.,"I totally enjoyed this book; it's very well written and, although it's fiction, thoroughly researched."
5,I loved this book,"We spent 3 months in China and HK in 1995 with out 2 teenagers. Travelling around by local trains, no tours and guides for us. I loved China in 1995. Wonder what it's like now. I love authentic Chinese food and this is a nice way to get an ""education""."
4,Good deal,considering the quality and price it is a good deal even though we are not talking about great shirts here.
3,What? No Animal?,"How in the world can you have the Electric Mayem without their faithful, frenetic drummer Animal? Missing out on some serious opportunity here. I mean, the only thing that made them worth watching was that you never knew what Animal was going to do next."
3,Too big for my small dog,"Overall this rain jacket is pretty cute and serves its purpose. My only problem is with the sizing. My dog is 12 inches long from base to tail, so I got him the small size. Unfortunately he was swimming in it. I had to make some alterations (shorten the belly strap and the front flap) and now it fits much better. As far as the seller, Grooming-Pet-Supplies service was great. I received my order few days after I placed it."
2,Giant sizing and return costs the same as coat,"This raincoat, size small, was listed as for an 8-12 inch dog (base of neck to rump). My dog is around 14 inches and this coat was huge on him. They will take a return, but charge $5 (you pay the return shipping, and they dock you $5 for the shipping you got free on the way out). Since the item was only $9.42, it makes no sense to pay to ship it back and then be docked another $5--that's right around the cost of the coat. So make sure you get the right size the 1st time.The coat itself is cute, easy to get on the dog and a decent value if you can get the right size."
2,Horrible Chemical Smell,"This jacket looks to be made well and the fitting guide was correct, but I cannot get past the TERRIBLE gasoline smell that it has. Once I opened the package, the smell went through my whole house and I had to take it outside. I washed in the washing machine, thinking that would get rid of the smell, but it didnt. I have had it hanging outside for a few days and it still hasnt gone away. I would NEVER put this on my dog JUST because of the smell. Its a shame because I think this rain jacket would suit my dog perfectly. I am going to return it."
4,Keeps doggy dry,"This comes in very handy to keep the dog dry when its raining. No more wet dog smell when he comes in. The length was perfect for my 18 pound min poodle mix, but the strap around the middle was very loose. They should increase the coverage of the soft part of the velcro strap so that I can adjust it appropriately. The material is nice and sturdy."
3,BBE Sonic Stomp,"Amazon sent the old sonic stomp instead of the pictured one. What's up that? uhmmm, FALSE ADVERTISMENT FOR SURE. will be contacting BBE on this issue and let them know what Amazon.com is doing!"
3,An Insult to Texans everywhere,"Brenda Frasier plays a sanctimonious, long-haired oogity-boogity new age sensitive guy street performer obsessed with decoupage and puppets who lives on spare change handouts. Joanna boing displays remarkable range as the vacuous, blank-eyed money grubbing shrew who is understandably put off by his attentions. Frasier takes his shirt off, but alas no nude scenes, and with that 3-day growth and fake-n-bake tan, he looks like he needs a bath. You can almost smell the B.O. Lou Rawls has the humiliating task of playing second banana to monkey boy&#65533;s as a backup musician. Lou shoulda kicked Brenda in the nuts, grabbed the girl by the hair, engaged in a few car chases and street brawls, then maybe this steaming pile of celluloid might have been watchable."
2,So bad it was good - not really,A movie about stupid people and crazed eels. What's not to like? Pretty much everything. My dog could make a better film - by not making a film at all.
1,Eel Be Comin' Around the Mountain...When Eel Come,"If this is the only film laying on your shelf on a long, long and lonely night, it is worth the effort...but don't expect anything but hokey pokey sci-fi amateur B.S. This one has no social redeeming value...and is worth the price I paid $.01 (really). I think it took more money to create the insert for the DVD box than it did to fund the horrendous special effects. If I were involved in this production, I would post a fictitious name on the credits screen. Razortooth is ""dull""...has no bite...and has such a worthless script, you'll find yourself laughing out loud. I think the person that carfted the artwork for the insert should be the highest paid individual with this project. Worthless...a waste of time...if I may...TOOTHLESS!"
4,A fitting tribute,"An enjoyable collection of obituaries written my Robert McG. Thomas Jr. These short (2-3 page) obituaries will make you smile and wonder what would be written about yourself. Some of the people you will recognize, most you will not, but you'll gain an understanding and appreciation for their time on this planet.Recommended"
4,Flatlands,"Flatlands is the first book written by Mississippi native Susan Sims Moody. Her story revolves around Jennifer Martin, a young college graduate who returns home reluctantly. Longing for a job as a reporter at a big city newspaper, she instead gets a job at the three-person weekly paper in her hometown, located in the Mississippi Delta. As she gets settled into her small rental house, Jennifer finds a small film canister in the wall while helping her friend Davis do some small maintenance work. Little does she know, the house contains items that its former occupant wants back desperately, no matter the cost. Susan weaves her story together in a seamless fashion, leaving her reader turning the pages wanting more. It is a fairly quick read. I finished all 135 pages in just a few hours. It was a great book and very enjoyable. I would suggest it to anyone looking for a great read.The author provided a copy of this book for review. I was not compensated in any way."
5,the last optical cleaner you'll ever need,"Every once in a while, I'll come across a product that fills it's purpose so completely and perfectly, that I say, ""that's it! I'm done looking, will you marry m?!"". This cleans optics.... done. No smears, no dust left over, no residue, and NO SCRATCHES. Doesn't rub off lens coatings at all. Use on sensitive camera equipment, or your motorcycle goggles. Clean your sunglasses, or your media projector lens. I can't get enough! Perfection in a spritzer"
3,i like it,"Like a lot of the gums by Lotte, the flavor doesn't last too long. But this used to be one of my favorite gums when I lived in Japan. I never thought that it tasted like cough medicine. Maybe it's just an acquired taste. I also used to chew only the hard shell gum. The stick gum wasn't as good, in my opinion. I still prefer American gum over Japanese gum but it's not horrible."
4,Short but amazing flavor,I lived in Japan for a little while and during that time I could say that I always carried a couple sticks of this gum with me. I love the flavor it is simply amazing but like some of the previous post mentioned it does not last long. Still highly recommend this for anyone looking a short burst of amazing blueberry flavored candy.
4,This will grab your attention,"The issue of domestic violence, mental and physical, is a serious issue that this book addresses in a simple and complex manner. It was easy to read, but talked about the intricacies of how abuse can affect the mind and body. The metaphors were easy to grab and deep in mneaning. Overall, the book was an interesting read."
5,The worrier's handbook,"The world is a dangerous place! There's the Ebola virus, thunderstorms, sleepy truckers, meteors, and licorice. Licorice? Yes, licorice. It can cause high blood pressure, lung congestion, and irregular heartbeat. (I'm having some of these symptoms now, just from thinking about my favorite candy!) And did you know that firing someone doubles your risk of heart attack, that tryingto quit smoking increases your risk of an accident, and that you're more likely to be murdered during the first week of the month? This funny book is a Godsend to those in desperate need of more things to worry about. Read it and be amused-- and forewarned."
3,A light read,"I was hoping to find this book to be funny,{as it was advertised} and full of things that i hadnt heard of before,It wasnt.I'm going to pass it on to a family member,maybe they'll like it better than i did."
5,great ladder,VERY STRONG AND WELL BUILT LADDER. I AM ABOUT 200 LBS. AND IT HELD ME UP LIKE A CHAMP.IT'S PERFECT FOR USING AROUND THE HOUSE.I WOULD RECOMMEND TO OTHERS.
3,Sand tropper and best,I never relly play with mine but it is still fun to play with. The toy is from A NEW HOPE when storm tropers serch Tatowen
4,One of the better in the series,"""Sharpe's Siege"" is one of the better entries in this series of novels. Although it's not directly based on an actual battle (which I tend to regard as a disadvantage in the occasional Sharpe novel that isn't solidly based on a specific battle), it still does an excellent job of capturing the feel of this type of a Napoleonic fight. And, unlike so many of the more formulaic entries in this series, ""Siege"" doesn't get bogged down in some unlikely sideplot involving a damsel in distress. Also, while the story does have a bit of a cloak-and-dagger element to it, this book doesn't go overboard on the 19th-century poor man's James Bond plotting in the way that ""Sharpe's Prey"" or ""Sharpe's Sword"" did."
1,Poorly Made.,"After purchasing this gun from Amazon, was I am very disappointed. At first glance, it looked great. But right when I picked it up, I knew something was wrong. It felt really flimsy, like it would break if I dropped it. Unfortunately that wasn't the worst of it, the first shot I fired flew way off target. At first I thought that, sense it was new, it just had to warm up. But to my dismay, every shot fired afterward turned out to be the same. After farther inspection, I found that the barrel was much to big, and because of this, the bb was bouncing around as it traveled through the shaft and therefore, sending it off track. Although it is undeniable that these look great and would be absolutely brilliant with the right costume, for me this has been a very disappointing purchase."
4,Makes you move!,"A nice mix of brazil and latin based beats. Classic styles and Contemporary club styles: Classic, hip, jazzy, and soul-full. Brazilian, Salsa, Merengue, Cuban, Hatian, etc... a nice balance of instrumental pieces and vocals. The first CD 'Sabroso' warms me up with classic styles, while the second CD 'Ardiente' just makes me get up and shake it with remixes. If you like a diversity of different types of Latin vibes from classic untouched pieces to ones mixed with acid jazz and club music, then you will like this album. This is a fun and tasteful mix."
4,Barrio Lantino II,I love this cd. It is a great latino groove cd. :-) There are also some great songs to salsa too!
2,Sleeze-R&B,"Chick Willis has been touring the South with his band for decades and the most popular thing that he does in his act is sing ""dirty"" songs and act lewd. He has never had a hit record because he really can't play and sing very well. Again, it all comes back to hearing him sing about vulgar subjects. The title cut ""Stoop down, baby...""was recorded live and is 21 minutes long (full of the audience yelling obscenities). Chick repeats the bridge in the song about 20 times begging the ladies in the audience to ""Stoop down and let your daddy see"". It's really crass. The song titled ""Muther Fuyer"" is silly and very juvenile. Before it's finally finished he finally says ""Muther F..ker"" ... This is a really bad cd...but some of you will buy it simply because you heard how bad it was."
1,What a disappointment,"The only saving grace of my experience with this book is that I borrowed it from the libary, so I didn't spend any money on this sorry piece of fiction.I have read ever Scarpetta novel and used to love them. I entered into this one knowing that they have been going down hill, but this one hit rock bottom. I got to the last page (not knowing it was the last page) and eagerly turned the page for the next chapter and was greeted by painfully empty endpages.Please, take my advice (and the advice of just about everyone else) do not bother with this one. You will walk away disappointed."
1,Blow Fly,"Has there ever been a worse book written by such a well-known author? I have never read Cornwall before, though I've heard of her, of course. This is the beginning and the end of my relationship with Ms. Cornwall. How many books did she try to ram into this one? At least five: Lucy and Rudy's relationship and the crime they were involved in; Nicky and her mother's murder; the evil twin brothers, and how they fumble through life; then we have Bev out there at the boathouse and her relationship with the handsome twin; oh yes, let's not forget the little boy who popped into the story out of nowhere; and on it goes. But here's the positive, I bought the book for fifty cents at a library used book sale. It's not hard to figure out why a library would dump this one! Readers, don't even waste ten cents on this horribly written book!"
1,Won't buy another Cornwell book,"Blow Fly is the last Cornwell book I'll spend a dime to buy. I was impressed with the first books in the Scarpetta series, particularly the incredible research that went into them and Cornwell's fine writing ability. Now, I'm only disappointed and disgusted with the story and the characters."
2,Very disappointing,"Normally the Scarpetta novels are exemplary; however Blow Fly reads much like Hornet's Nest and Southern Cross. It's written from the perspective of different characters, everyone but Scarpetta it seems. The wit, the humor, the intelligence that make Scarpetta novels my favorites are completely lacking. The Scarpetta storyline it seems is spiraling further and further away from reality, its plot relying increasingly on farfetched coincidences, over-the-top bad guys and well, just plain boring sub-plots thrown in for bulk. Why did Scarpetta stop investigating real crimes and instead became the target of a huge conspiracy of evil? It is really hard to stomach anymore. As a once die-hard Scarpetta fan, I thought it would be impossible for me to dislike a Scarpetta novel, but this one is only worth reading to keep up with events. And one MAJOR issue - don't read the synopsis if you don't want a very important plot detail given away!!!"
1,blow off,"This book was engaging but annoying. Too much like the Dallas season opener where we find out it was a bad dream. Resurecting past characters they way Cornwell did was silly. But I would have still said read it if it hadn't been for the ending. I was listening on tape and at the end I felt maybe I had skipped a tape. Was I missing something??? I still feel like I didn't get my ""monies worth"" in this novel."
2,A book that felt like a stretch to reel in old readers...,"I never write reviews here, but felt compelled because of the HUGE letdown I'm having reading this book.I almost feel as if PC knows her books have declined in recent years and is trying to shake things up with a huge twist and a new point of view.The twist was just annoying and not very believable. And reading a Scarpetta book in third person was just distracting and doesn't nearly have the pacing and personality of her earlier novels.Characteristics that I came to love in characters in her Scarpetta novels are now hugely annoying. I wouldn't waste my money on the hardcover version of this book. Wait for the paperback and buy it used."
1,A disappointed faithful Scarpetta fan,"I was so excited to receive and start reading Blow Fly. As it turns out I am 3/4 of the way through the book and I am having a hard time finishing it. I feel all Scapetta fans have been let down. I can't tell you how disappointed I am with this latest lack of storyline etc. My sister is also an avid Scarpetta fan and she was also very disappointed. I hope the next novel in the series brings us back to characters that we know and love. Hopefully, this one will be explained as a bad dream."
1,Terrible,"Used to enjoy the Scarpetta books, however this is one of the very worst books I've ever read."
4,Scarpetta Fan,Always fun to listen to Kay's adventures. An annoyance is the confusing nature of Lucy and Kay's relationship. It is not clear as to why they have such irritation with one another. Some things are a bit too convenient. I will keep listening to the Scarpetta series.
1,Don't Read It - Even if it's Free!,"What a waste of time - What is it about Kay Scarpetta? Why do all of these bad guys dwell on Kay? (It is so narcissistic.) The plotlines are very farfetched. And worst of all, after slugging through all the pages, the action is all over in about 4 pages -"
1,Unending torture,The worst of Patricia Cornwall meets the worst of Thomas Harris (Hannibal). Kay Scarpetta's creator has mimicked Harris' descent from taut to turgid; suspenseful to soporific; exciting to enervating. A good gift for the trashcan.
1,"Terrible read, even for a die-hard fan","I really enjoy the Scarpetta books, but this one is truly unreadable, poorly written, with a hard to follow story line.I re-read The Last Precinct before starting Blow Fly, which helped, but this book is a disappointment. What a shame."
2,Cornwell is not at her best,"I'd been looking so forward to this book. But when I got to the end of the novel, I wondered where the rest of the chapters were. I felt that as a reader, I was shorted. True, there were some great aspects of the book, in particular, bringing together older characters and introdcuing some new ones. But for the most part, the book left me hanging. Some pretty big events happen at the end of the book, but there were few explanations and no closure at all."
2,Blow Fly didn't fly with me.,"I am an avid Kay Scarpetta fan, have read every book, but this one may stop the process. I found it disjointed and leaving huge gaps in the plot. And the characters have changed too much in this book to feel they are the same people I've grown to know and care about over many years. I was very disappointed."
1,Another Disappointing Cornwell Ramble,"Just BORROW the book - I keep wondering what the hell has happened to the finely plotted and wonderfully detailed novels of the Patricia Cornwell of the past. This one is not quite as bad as the last two - Black Notice and The Last Precinct. But the Hurry-Up ending smacks so much of Poirot in the drawing room finale, it's hardly worth the bother.Do you not have an editor, Miss Cornwell?Do you think your name alone will sell your books?Do you think we are stupid?Too bad - another once-fine writer has gone over the edge into unbelievable plots, superficial wand-waving, and too much teen-age-girl-angst-type dialog. GET A GRIP!"
1,A waste of time and money,"Actually, my title pretty much says it all.This book was an absolute bore and I found myself skimming it.I will not give any ""suspense"" away but there are developments here that should be beneath the author. If Cornwell wants to continue the Scarpetta series, she owes her readers better than this. Perhaps its time to ""retire"" Kay Scarpetta and move on."
1,Filth,"Speaking of books, last night I tried to listen to that Patricia Cornwell book, Blow Fly. It's the most disgusting thing I ever heard. I listened to the first CD and thought it surely gets better, but the second was worse. I hit the stop button so hard that I nearly knocked the player off the night stand. And to think there are 13 CDs in all. I can't believe people read such filth. I would donate it to the library, but I wouldn't want anyone to know I had it in my possession."
2,Big fan letdown...again!!,"I almost stopped reading on page one when I realized Cornwell carried the use of the third person narrative into this book, too. It did not work well; it makes me think she's not writing these books anymore. And, when what's produced is ridiculous and boring, it solidifies that thought even more. I was surprised and confused about Lucy coming on to Rudy and that Scarpetta was barely in the book at all. I don't understand how intelligent readers are to accept that the Wolfman just strolls out of prison...blind, on death row, high security, etc. Ridiculous. I was tired of that character when he first appeared and am dreading the next book where I'm sure he'll take center stage. Also, to so quickly kill Bev without much story, to not share Jay Talley's ending with us, and to wrap up the story in about three pages? What a letdown. As a book editor myself, I am stunned that something like this went to press."
1,Extremely disappointing,"A dammed shame - a book with a lot of potential but does not live up to the rest of the Scarpetta novels.Moves to the third person making the writing a disappointment.Seems to have got lost writing the Scarpetta novels - crisp, strong plot, great character definition and tangled but easy to follow plot. Follows more of the dodgy Cop novels with short chapters and chopping and changing between characters.Interesting story with the person under protection by the FBI/Senator Lord etc. Fairly believeable, but fails to deliver a good plot line based on ""The Last Precinct"" and ""Black Notice"".A disappointing read all in all. Will I buy the next one in hardback? - very doubtful now. Borrow it from the library before making the decision to buy."
1,Can't believe I bothered to finish the book...,"I kept thinking it would get better and I gave her the benefit of the doubt, because I enjoyed previous books by Cornwell. But I agree with others that are also tired of the wolf man character, and I missed the forensic science piece that always made her books so compelling. A huge disappointment."
1,The Death of Dr. Scarpetta,"What a disappointment! Instead of the hard hitting novels withinteresting and factual forensic science,as in the past, we get aserial novel. The first quarter of the book was nothing butrehash of past Scarpetta novels. The forensic is limited to afew pages at the end of the novels. It seems Ms. Cornwall is onlyinterested in keeping her characters going without any of theenthusiasm or originality of prior novels. She has gonethe way of Anne Rice and will be gone from any best seller listafter this one."
1,my 2 cents,"In my opinion this book is borderline-acceptable, but only as a stand-alone and not as part of a series.As an installment in a serial, there are too many inconsistencies in the events reported in earlier installments versus how those same events are represented here.Also there is a shift away from the 1rst person perspective. Perhaps it is meant as a vehicle encouraging the reader to feel the same distance that perhaps Scarpetta is supposed to be feeling, but I don't like it. I'd prefer consistency.All-in-all, to me this book has the bad after-taste of a ghost-writer filling in in order to meet a deadline. That doesn't mean I won't buy and read the next one, but if the inconsistencies and the wrong feel continues in the next it will be my last Scarpetta novel purchase."
3,Not the Scarpetta novel you've come to expect!,"I felt very disappointed with this novel. The only thing it had in common with Cornwell's previous novels were that it used the same characters. Otherwise, I felt as if this book had been ghost written or that she was on drugs when she wrote it. She kept referring to Kay as Scarpetta and it was almost as a third person telling the story instead of in the first person as she normally writes. Most of the Scarpetta novels I devour and can't put them down. I also enjoy re-reading them. This novel, however, I had a hard time getting through and will not be repeating it. I am hoping the new book, Trace, will be better, otherwise I will discontinue collecting and reading her novels."
2,Where's the Kay I love?,"I was looking forward to meeting my old friend Kay Scarpetta again, but she was a shadow of herself in this latest book. All the characters lacked their unique personalities and depth, leaving the plot flat. All the members of the Scarpetta cast were depressed and lifeless and seemed to have little true interaction with each other.The ending was particularily disappointing--a slapdash conclusion that really isn't....there's another book out there in development waiting to finish off the Chandonne's--I hope. I've gotten very tired of this plot line that has been running through several Scarpetta books. The Wolfman was never Cornwell's best villian, but he's been around the longest."
3,This Sucked,"I was very disappointed with this book. It was a let down and left so many questions unanswered. Which I imagine will come out in another book. It was very evasive in a lot of areas and very predictable in other areas. Not as detailed as her other books. She must have been on a deadline, and just wrote anything to make the book sell, because I am sure a lot of people bought this with the anticipation of getting their money's worth."
1,Another author meltdown,I have not felt this disappointed with a book since I read Hannibel (Thomas Harris). Don't waste your money or your time on Blow Fly.
1,RIPOFF,"THIS IS NOT A KAY SCARPETTA NOVEL, AND TO SAY SO IS FALSE ADVERTISING. AS A HUGE SCARPETTA FAN, I CAN TELL Y0U THAT CORNWELL AND PUTNAM HAVE KILLED OFF KAY THROUGH THE FLIMIEST , SADDEST RIPOFF I'VE EVER READ. THIS BOOK IS TRANSPARENTLY AN ATTEMPT TO GET YOUR MONEY, AND MINE, AS SCARPETTA FANS. THE NOVEL READS SO BADLY, LACKS SUCH EXCITING FORENSICS - AND NO SOLID STORY THREAD - THAT ONE MUST ASSUME THAT CORNWELL, GIVEN HER BUSY SCHEDULE, DID NOT WRITE THIS BOOK. CHARACTERS MERELY BEAR THE FAMILIAR NAMES OF KAY AND PETE AND WESLEY BUT NOT THEIR PERSONALITIES. AND THAT THE BOOK IS IN THIRD PERSON TOTALLY DESTROYS THE UNIQUE VOICE THAT IS KAY'S. THE EDITORS AT PUTNAM HAVE TO BE HELD AS ACCOUNTABLE AS CORNWELL IN THIS GREEDY RIPOFF. KAY IS DEAD, AND I FOR ONE WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER CORNWELL BOOK. EVER"
1,WHO WROTE THIS BOOK???!!!,"I haven't even completed 10 chapters in this book... I'm not sure I can finish it. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. I am so glad that I got it from the library.The first thing I noticed and it is HUGE, HUGE, HUGE... Why did Cromwell go from writing Scarpetta in first person singular to third person? Very, very disturbing... I'm having a hard time reading this book for that alone. Did she really write this book, why the sudden change?And I know they BIG SECRET (I was told), what utter and complete TRASH. I haven't like the last few books. The themes have been off the wall, unrealistic, and sometimes downright unreadable.What happened to the much honored author of yesterday? Is she gone forever? Will she be forever ill with the fatal ""New York Times Best Seller"" disease, which seems to affect most good writers? Why do authors listen to editors and/or publishing houses and forget their loyal fan?"
2,Not as good as her usual work,"I keep hoping Patricia Cornwall will rebound and start writing the kinds of books she used to write when I first started reading her. Kay Scarpetta was one of the most dynamic women to hit the fiction scene and I could not get enough of her during the early years. But perhaps time has weakened her and Cornwell, too. She just isn't as clever as she used to be.I would not recommend this book to anyone who enjoys mysteries. You simply do not get enough twists and turns and unpredictable plot points here. You get a lot of formula and the same thing you see in many mystery novels. I would really suggest you go back and start with her earlier work."
1,In a word: Disappointing,"I love Patricia Cornwell, I began reading her books because I enjoy thrillers and live in VA, making it easy to follow along. But the last few Scarpetta books have gone down hill. The latest, Blow Fly was horrible. I could normally get through a Cornwell novel in a day, it took me 2 weeks to get through Blow Fly and then the end felt like it was rushed, as though she was pushing to make a deadline. If this is the kind of Scarpetta novels we can expect in the future, she should just save it, I won't buy the next!"
1,was this really written by patricia Cornwell???,"I have been a big fan of all the Kay Scarpetta series in the past,but this book was so way off the mark, it was very hard to keep myself reading it in case it improved along the way.It didn't.The whole style of writing was different,poor farfetched storylines,no depth in the characters,it really seemed hard to believe that this was written by the same author as the other great books in the series.It seemed to jump around a lot as well,as though there has been a missing novel in between!!Since when has Lucy been into boys?The last few novels she has been portrayed as a strictly girls only type of gal,now she is having sex when she feels like it with her work partner?Bizarre?Marino's character so was different i just couldn't get my head around these people.This book was so not worth the read,i was disappointed ++++++++++++"
1,What's with Amazon's Ratings?,"I was just wondering how this book could possibly receive an ""average customer rating"" of five stars, ""based on two customer reviews"" when there were actually four reviews, and the average rating would be no more than two stars???? It appears that Amazon is falsifying the product rating for this book to boost sales for a packaged bestseller that obviously isn't up to the pre-publication hype. Makes me wonder about the honesty of their customer review system. I suppose it's anything for a buck, eh?"
1,I got the outline-where is the book??,"Such a disappointment-a sketchily told story, not filled in at all, jumps all over the place, a lot of disjointed scenes that don't add to the story at all. She has disappointed me before with the horrible Hornet's Nest but this is even worse. My dog tried to eat it, but even she gave up on it."
1,GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT,"I am a long time Patricia Cornwell fan and have read all her books. I was looking forward to the return of K. Scarpetta in BLOW FLY but this is a dull mess. The story jumps around, leaving loose ends everywhere. The plot, if you can call it that is thin, senseless, and totally unbelievable. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!"
2,Wait for the paperback,"Even though this book wasn't what I'd been waiting for; I WANTED SCARPETTA! it was a compelling but simple read. To many questions were answered to quickly and others left you hanging. Ms. Cornwell what were you thinking? This book isn't one of your better Dr Kay books. If you are preparing us for a Last Precint series just make a public anouncement.Yes, you do need to read this book if you're a fan. No, you don't need it in hard cover, unless you buy it used. When the sequel comes out I'm waiting a year for the paperback edition.Disappointed"
1,Blow Fly,"After considerable thought, I have come to the conclusion that Cornwell did not write this book. I can't fathom how as good an author as she, who has written so many very good books in this series, could come up with such a dog. This book plain stinks!It has no flowing continuity, but jumps back and forth and around to too many different unimportant characters. All her previous books of this series I found I had much difficulty in putting it down; this book, when I put it down, I wanted to leave it there. I read about 40% of the book and floored it. Patricia, write your own books!!!"
1,"Blow, blew, BLOWN","Ugly, ugly, UGLY! A sorry apology for the cracking good writer Ms Cornwell used to be. Graphic descriptions of low butchery, shot'em-all-on-the-spot show downs and improbable resurrections are not the stuff I like to find in a good thriller. Besides, I feel I'm quite fed up with serial killers. Why do they kill? Because they're mad, of course. Wow! Shocking! I'd rather have your old fashioned butler any time... And what the hell happened to spunky, self assured, self reliant, rational Doctor Kay Scarpetta? Who is this pathetic looser stumbling around with no rational purpose, this pale wraith of her former robust self?And why on earth should a brilliant, beautiful, smart girl like Lucy waste her life away ad a dumb gunwoman? And what is this fascination with self made judgement and execution on the spot?Get yourself together, Ms Cornwall. I used to love your novels, but now I feel very disappointed."
2,Did I miss something?,"I looked forward to another Scarpetta novel, having read all the others, but this was a real disappointment. It didn't really seem to go anywhere, and jumped from one idea to another, so it was confusing. I kept wondering if I was missing something! I was hoping the Chandonne story line would come to an end in this book, but, it seems there's room for more, as seen by the ending, which happened way too fast with very little detail or explanation. I still feel like I missed something. This was a very disatisfying book, to say the least. The Kay Scarpetta I love reading about would not have put up with this!"
1,disappointing,"Please, Ms. Cornwell. Go back to what you do best. Focus on forensics and quit trying to create a sequel-series. This story takes forever to get started. The first third of the bok is a recap of previous stories. It appears Ms. Cornwell had a deadline to meet and wrote the whole book in a few hours. The worst part is that she ends the story with a promise that this weak story is to be continued. Guess I'll pass on the next one."
1,I Wish I'd Read the Reviews First...,I gobble up her books so it never occurred to me that her latest wouldn't be as good as her previous novels. What an utter disappointment Blow Fly was to me. I'm boycotting buying from now on and will check books out from the library in the future. I was appalled...
1,Not Again!,"After the last two Scarpetta disasters, I swore off Cornwell. But got suckered back in by the promise of the ""old Kay."" Well, I got the ""old Kay"" but from the last two disasters. Tortured, lugubrious characters; improbable, conspiracy-theory plots; and worst of all - written in present tense! How pretentious and very distracting to read. Like it or not, Ms. Cornwell, the prime consideration for a writer is the audience. I suggest you stick with a diary if you feel so compelled to put forth your own agenda at the expense of the reader."
1,Huh??,"I LOVED this series so much so that I marked the release of this book on my calendar. I finished it last night and have just one thing to say about - ""Huh?""Where did the crazy hairy guy go? How did Jay get killed- was I reading too fast in anticipation? How did the Chardonne family end up in Baton Rouge? How did Winn know who Scarpetta was on the plane? What was the Dard piece about knowing Nic's mother?? Did Nic ever make the connection between seeing Bev at Walmart and once she was killed at the swamphouse? What...now Nic's family owned the swaphouse that Jay and Bev were staying at? Were Jaime and Lucy once involved?Maybe my ADD was in rare form but I couldn't follow a single thread in this book. I felt like I was reading 60 degrees of separation- is Kevin Bacon around the corner or maybe in the wine cellar?Don't waste your money!"
3,Could have - should have been better!!!,"I have to agree with previous reviewers. Although, I did need the refresher from the ""Last Precinct"" - it has been years and many books in between that I almost totally forgot what happened in that book. So I did not mind the synopsis going on in this book. I did however, mind the short plot - after reviewing the last book there really wasn't much happening in ""Blowfly"". I felt there were characters introduced in this book that didn't need to be or were there for another motive (like Nic Robillard - is she worthy of an independent book of her own?) Basically, PC wrote this to reintroduce Benton back to the Scarpetta books (I missed him).The book is what it is - borrow it from the library!!"
2,Grave disappointment,"Having read all the Scarpetta novels, I was looking forward to another, but disliked Cornwell's approach from the get-go. I never rekindled any like for any of the characters, and felt she muddled her way through a half-baked idea. Very little held together, the characters were all on the verge of or within nervous breakdowns, and just when things would get suspenseful or interesting, the novel would break down.It's a pity that once good novelists like Cornwell or Clancy really make it, they rest on their laurels and dispense with the aid of a good editor. The more recent efforts from these authors are not good (I didn't even finish Clancy's, it was so bad, which is in shocking contrast to his older books.)"
2,Blow Fly,"While eagerly anticipating this release, I was edgy about the lengthy span between Scarpetta novels. After borrowing the book from my area library, I was disappointed in the fragmentation of the story. A new residence for Kay and Rose, continuation of the malignant evil of the Chandonne twins, a potential new friend for Lucy...none held my interest. I wanted the forensic leads, the puzzling threads of evidence, Kay cooking when she is stressed. I would go back to reading the first five Scarpetta novels before I would bother with Blow Fly. Jean Baptiste is out there, perhaps intent on eradicating Benton for real the next time. I hope this storyline is put to rest in the next installment."
3,Not Her Best!,"I always wait anxiously for the next ""Scarpetta"" novel and I was excited to get this one. However, I was disappointed with it. The story was too gruesome and as other reviewers have said, there was too much violence toward animals. I was glad to find that Benton Wesley was alive and well but did not like the way that story line evolved. I also found the ending very abrupt. I will still look forward to the next Scarpetta story and hope that Ms. Cornwell will redeem herself. This was unfulfilling and left me questioning what Ms. Cornwell was thinking."
1,Dissappointed,"I would have given this book 0 stars but I was forced to put at least one because the site did not offer the 0 star option. I waited 3 years for the Scarpetta series to continue and was fully disappointed. The character is in about 1/4 of the book as the book focuses on Marino, Benton, Lucy and the Wolfman. The book was missing something and that was Scarpetta. I hope Cornwell can redeem herself by writing another Scarpetta novel real soon. I was so disappointed. I would not recommend reading this one as I consider it a skip."
1,Scarpetta should be put to rest!,"This book more than any other i've seen illustrates how someone comes up with a very good book or two, establishes a name, and then churns out pure junk in order to make more $$. As a great admirer of the first several Scarpetta stories, it is disappointing to see Cornwell doing this to her readers. The story is absurb, the story-line almost non-existent, the details unbelievable. How does the villain, on death row in Texas, now blind, covered with hair all over, manage to kill his guards, change clothes, and walk undetected to freedom? Please! All this is apparently setting up another Scarpetta story, with more $$ for the author from her trusting fans. Do yourself a favor and skip this one, watch reviews, and if Cornwell ever reverts to previous form, get on board again. For now, Patricia Cornwell should be ashamed."
2,The blind can now see...and drive too,"I have to agree with the other negative reviews on this one. I had read the previous novels in the Scarpetta series, and this one proved to be a big let-down. The ending is a mess - too abrupt and certainly leaves you with too many questions. Also, how does a death row inmate escape, kill two guards, and drive away from the prison when he is supposedly blind??"
1,What happened?,"I loved all of Cornwell's Scarpetta novels and was excited to see a new one arrive. After reading it, I regret spending money on it. What happened? The change from her usual first person narrative to third-person present alone drove me nuts. And at the end, things just suddenly seemed to be wrapped up - like a tv show that has to fit everything in during the last five minutes. I agree with another reviewer -- it was hard to believe she actually wrote this. Truly disappointing."
1,Did Cornwell Really Write This?,Blow Fly was so boring I'm hard pressed to think Patricia Cornwell really wrote it.
2,Blow Fly,I was really disappointed in this latest Scarpetta novel. The plot was all over the place and there was not enough about Scarpetta. The ending was rushed. Why bring Benton back? MOVE ON.......
1,What is going on here?,"I have read every Kay Scarpetta book out there and this one is, in my opinion, full of errors. First and foremost, Lucy left the FBI due to that relationship with Carrie and the problems with the computer system she created as an intern. Never before have we even heard of this ""rape"" scenerio. Also, how can she even think of trying to pull off Benton's return? It's time for some new characters, not a return from the dead like some sort of deranged soap opera. Where is the Kay Scarpetta we all know and love? Why has Particia Cornwell forgotten her own books? I hope it gets better after this one."
1,Not up to her usual standard,"Cornwell shifts point of view here, from protagonist Kay Scarpetta's first person vulnerable (which made the earlier books so interesting) to third person boring. She devotes endless pages to minutiae that have no bearing on the plot, and describes the characters in one-dimensional terms (Scarpetta is ""lonely,"" ""brave,"" and adored by all who know her, while the rather pathetic Chandonne is invariably presented as loathsome because of his congenital abnormalities). Strangest of all, it seems that around page 440 Cornwell realized that she had to start wrapping things up, so within 10 pages or so she whips her characters into line with almost no emotional satisfaction for the reader. One particularly frustrating outcome is that of the three nasty villains, one is disposed of offhand, another dies offstage (as we are later told), and the third escapes (also not shown), no doubt to induce us to buy the next Scarpetta book. Ms. Cornwell, get back to where you were before!"
2,Cornwell jumps the shark,"Very disappointing work. Her book on Jack the Ripper obviously didn't do well enough, so she rushed out this stinker. The only cliche she left out was the evil twin,...wait there are two evil twins in this. ;-)She is much too talented to produce this stuff. Blame also goes to Putnam for putting this out. Should have gone directly to paperback or maybe under a pseudonym."
2,Leaves a lot to be desired,I have read all of Patricia Cornwells novels and I have never felt as if I desired anything more from them. They always hold my attention and interest. I find them facinating. As I started this book my usual mode of constant page turning quickly turned into looking for reason to put down the book...I just could not get into it. I was bored. Then ending just seemed abrupt and did not make any since to me. It was predictable and slow. I have the upmost faith that Cornwell will redeem herself in the next novel...I hope anyway.
2,Sadly disappointed,"Having followed Patricia Conrwell's Scarpetta series, I would have to say that this one lacked her usual flair. The books starts out at a good rate, but by the time you finish it you will disappointed. Without giving away the ending, she leaves you hanging about some of the characters."
1,Couldn't get into it.,"I bought this book years ago and attempted to read it. I got a few pages in and just couldn't keep going. It's written in present tense, and it was very distracting to try to read. Just a few minutes ago, I found it on my bookshelf, and thought I would try to read it again. It didn't fair so well this time either. I really can't stand this method of writing. I was a fan of the first few Scarpetta stories, and I'm really disappointed."
2,Not what I expected...,"This book was not what I expected. The writing was written as though by a narrator, observing each of the characters and their thoughts, which I didn't like. I'd read bad reviews of this book, but I purchased it more out of curiosity than anything else, since it is a link between the last book and the one after. They could definitely have introduced certain characters better than they did...and half the time you are left thinking, ""huh?"" Definitely not my favorite book by far, but since I have read the other books by Patricia Cornwell, I'm not giving up hope on the author just yet."
1,Not worthy,"It is hard to believe that the same author that wrote all the previous Scarpetta novels actually wrote this. The style is totally different, and not for the better. There is no central plot, no main crime to solve, just a jumble of hodge podge thoughts leading nowhere. Very disappointing."
2,All loose ends!,"I was SO DISAPPOINTED! There were interesting characters but they had stories that went nowhere! And why name the book Blow Fly????? I realize the book bases itself on previously introduced characters, but the plot just never made it. The ending was horrible. I found myself wanting to call Cornwell, after reading nightly, and asking why she let me down at the end??????? I think Cornwell is brilliant, but this was bad. It had a lot of possibilities but too many side streets. And where was Scarpetta?????"
1,Disappointed Fan,"I have just finished reading BLOW FLY (with the most difficult effort!)...and I must say I am finished with Patricia Cornwell. Hooked on her first novels, I eagerly awaited the next Kay Scarpetta volume. However, I noticed a definite turn in PC's writing with HORNET'S NEST. While I continued to purchase her subsequent novels (I am a collector of First Editions), I had not read them until reading BLOW FLY this week. Cornwell's work has taken a most decadent and perverse twist. In place of good mystery and intrigue now appears page after page of gross convoluted text. The reader is mired in confusing perverted dialogue, jumping from one character to another, chapter after chapter. With concentrated effort, I managed to finish this latest book of Cornwell's. If Patricia Cornwell's name was not on the cover, I would swear BLOW FLY was not written by the same person who wrote BODY FARM. I will no longer purchase any of her novels."
2,Ho Hum,"I felt that the latest Scarpetta novel did not really tie in with previous books - it was almost as though the author suddenly decided to change directions but left some discrepancies throughout the series. Being written in the present tense made it very difficult to read, and from the third person perspective made the characters seem distant and unreal.Having said that, the storyline was engaging and the plot wrapped up nicely at the end... however, I am left with the feeling of WHERE TO NOW??"
4,The Right Direction,I have read all of the Scarpetta books and was beginning to lose interest as Scarpetta became more and more depressed. This book serves to tie-up a lot of loose ends from the last couple of books and sets the stage for future stories of the strong-willed and brilliant Scarpetta so many enjoy reading about. Bravo Ms. Cornwell.
5,Wonderful!!!!,I loved this book. I had read all of the reviews and thought I wouldn't like it but I loved it. I liked the fact that she brought back her person from the dead. She explained it well and fit it into the plot. I can't wait for the next book!!!!!
1,I see it isn't just me - P.U. this book stinks,"I am not even through reading this book yet and I came to Amazon to see if it was just me who doesn't like this book. I have read every single Scarpetta book and like all of you I preorder ASAP and anxiously await the new one... This is written ALL WRONG. Was not every other book written in the 1st person????? I see about 95% of the reviews are negative. Do I even bother finishing?? I don't run to pick it up or stay up all night for ""just one more page"" so perhaps I should throw in the towel."
2,Lead Zeppelin,Somehow this book just doesn't seem to get off the ground. I put it down after 120 pages. Cornwell's other books were better.
1,This is the last Cornwell novel I'll waste my time on....,Such a disappointment. Fame and a well-known name do not always equal quality. The book got off to an okay start and perhaps even had potential to go somewhere. (I am being generous.) But it seemed like Cornwell just got tired of writing and scratched out a third-rate ending. I'm looking for a different author.
1,Political Nonsense,The author has a basic misunderstanding of the motives of de Baif and the political realities of that time. The inability of the author to grasp the actuality of de Baif's real circumstances has led to a book which owes more to fantasy than fact.The complete failure of the book to express the workings of political patronage at that time has again led it up a cul-de-sac from which there is no return.This book will be of no interest to any real political or social historian and indeed may actually compromise the perceptions of political or social students seeking enlightenment.The factual basis of the book is frequently faulty will glaring errors and omissions.I do not endorse this book
4,Good but not perfect,"I did not have the problem locking the base down the way the other reviewers did. But one must note that this base is not an exact fit for the Jet 6"" jointer. The machine ""swims"" a couple of inches on the base, which can obviously be a problem when putting pressure on the tool. I solved this by drilling through the Jet flanges right through the base and bolting the unit to the base with short Hex bolts with washers and nuts. Now it's very solid."
4,Beatriz Batarda is the most gorgeous woman I have ever seen,The film was alright-BUT I just want to go on record as saying that Beatriz Batarda is the most gorgeous woman I have ever seen-PERIOD!!!!!!
4,Good but not the best!,"This book is a good resource for learning ASL signs. While it does do a good job introducing beginners to ASL phrases and also displays the difference between ASL and Signed Exact English (often mistaken for ASL), it does not explain the grammar rules of ASL. The point being that, after one has learned the signs in the book, one has no way of knowing how to form other phrases on their own. Instead of teaching the method, this book teaches memorization. This is okay sometimes but for those who REALLY want to learn the language and become fluent, it is not enough. To learn ASL grammar, I would recommend ""American Sign Language: A Teacher's Resource Text on Grammar and Culture"" by Baker-Shenk and Cokely. All in all, this book is pretty good and is much better than many other resources out there, it's just not enough."
4,Great addition to the ASL student's library,"As a first semester student in ASL I found this book to be a great refernece. It does a nice job of explaining sentence structure, and to get acorss the point that ASL is not signed English.The only down side is some of the pictures are confusing as to the signs being made. I've had to reference a dictionary to verify the signing.Highly recommended."
