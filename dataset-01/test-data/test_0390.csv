2,Dissenting Opinion,One of the speakers had very poor treble response compared to the other - I would guess a fault with something. Even the other one sounded really muted compared to a Cambridge Soundworks outdoor speaker that has weathered 7 New England winters.
5,Love my Fiesta Chop Plate,"I love this chop plate. I got the Sunflower and plan to use it as a plater. I already have a larger chop plate that I use on Thanksgiving for the Turkey, this one I can use for the Ham. Thank you Amazon for providing Fiesta dishes at a reasonable rate."
4,Easy and it works.,"I tried this humidifier for my daughter's 1/4 size violin because I couldn't find a small enough dampit style humidifier for her size. This is basically a clam shell style case which opens up to reveal a small package of dry granules. The idea is that you soak the bag in distilled water (I personally used tap water and it worked fine) and it swells up to a nice plump sac of gel which you place in side the clam case. The humidity from the water filled gel should exit through the holes of the case, thus humidifying your instrument. It lasts a long time, maybe a week or two before needing to wet it again. It of course depends on how dry your climate is. Very easy to use. The only problem is , if you have a small instrument case, you will have to figure out where to stick the stretto without causing friction/scratches to your violin. I placed ours near the edge where nothing would contact it."
3,Great bag...Too bad it's Too small!,"The bag itself is great. The problem is that it was featured as being compatable with the JVC GRAXM225U Camcorder. Well...It isn't! It is too small. There isn't enough room to hold the camera, the charger, the VHS cartridge, RCA cables and a spare tape. It would be great for those who only want it to hold the camera and the VHS tape cartridge. But then where are you going to keep the rest of your ""stuff""!"
5,WOW! DON'T MISS THIS ONE!,"I never heard of this movie, and neither didanyone else I know, but I happen to catch iton cable, and boy am I glad I did! It's anincredible true story, of a medical breakthrough, that takes place, in the early 40s.The acting is top notch, and the story isunforgetable! This is a must see!"
5,Excellent movie!,"Something the Lord Made is an excellent movie! It is a true story which would capture the hearts of everyone. This is one of the Lords true miracles. He has given Dr. Alfred Balock & ""lab techninian"" Vivien Thomas the skills & caring for these babies. The reason I put lab techninian in quotes is because he was much more than that title is usual labled. I would recommend this movie to anyone."
5,The Lord Made,"This movie is excellent, really puts things in perspective and reminds us all that we are able and capable of anything within our grasp and faith."
5,Superb acting,"The other five star reviews are right! There aren't enough superlatives for Alan Rickman's and Mos Def's performances, and the supporting actors are wonderful also. I haven't seen Bolton Marsh in anything before, but I'll surely look for him in the future!"
5,Should be part of education diversity curriculum!,"This film reminds us of the disenfranchisement experienced by Black Americans in the last century. That Johns Hopkins finally did the 'right thing' by awarding Vivien Thomas a doctorate, made this viewer feel some victory had been gained over ignorance and racism. I felt drained after watching this movie. I cried several times. I've since purchased it for several people. I wish this movie could be shown to middle school kids, particularly in the inner city, to show them how they, too, could defy the odds and that dreams can come true."
5,Very good film,This is one of the best films I've seen and I will add it to my DVD library when it is released. The story is gripping and the negative impact of racism is well portrayed. There is language in the film that some will find offensive.
4,Inspiring movie,Inspiring story of a doctor and carpenter that worked together to pioneer heart surgery on children. Good for all ages.
5,Way more than I expected,"Have to say I was worried about buying a DVD on line as the last ones (from a different site) didn't work, but really wanted to get this as a gift and decided to get one for myself. Finally watched the movie last week. It was an awesome movie! O, and it played wonderfully too!I am just starting a career in health care and had been told the movie was about tetrology of fellot but it was about SO MUCH MORE!!!!"
5,Fantastic,"What a beautiful, touching movie. It's a true story and a tear jerker. What a keeper of a movie.Even my teenage daughter loved it!"
4,agree,"I can only agree with everybody else. The bad is big, but it pays off after a while, becuase you can carry Smart Media cards, batteries, a camera, a cable, a pair of sunglasses and a micro-recording device in this bag at the same time. For me as a music journalist, that's a great thing. The bad thing is that you can't really wear it over yur shoulder like a bigger bag. It looks and feels dumb. Besides that, this is a good product."
1,useless design: 'dumb' bells,"I bought this item and had to return it, everything seems perfect when it arrives but the collars wont fit to the bars which makes them completely useless. the collars are so plastic that they cant hold the weights tightly.you can still buy it if your insurance pays for breaking your feet."
5,Perfect for Degree standard Philosophy,"I found this book to be most helpful in revising for my exams. It is relevant to every level of my degree and has helped me immensely. There are short, excellently structured and well-written chapters on many major philosophers, beginning with the Presocratics working right through to the twentieth century. Each philosopher is dealt with in 'easy-to-chew' segments and although they are afforded only 15 or 20 pages each, there is enough there to provide a good introduction to the philosopher's thoughts. I can't praise this book enough. My only regret is that it took me so long to find! I have to give a big 'Well Done!' to the authors of this book."
4,typical asian fare,this is a hard to find 2 dvd collection. the stories are strange but the typical asian nudity with somewhat of a disjointed story line and mythic asian backstory. only for the real fans
3,A young boy's approximation of feminism.,"One is tempted to suspect the feminist credentials of any male director, especially in a film featuring graphic female ..., and a not-exactly-hostile-to-adolescent-male-fantasy bath scene complete with naked women, licking and a cute maid's outfit.Nevertheless, one must applaud Hosoyama's intentions - he far outstrips the similarly themed and styled 'To Die For' in terms of both visual imagination and ideological sympathy. What begins as a media satire turns into a gleefully bizarre S&M; martial arts fantasy. The terms of the conflict are gendered - the sterile post-modern male world of the media and virtual reality; and the older female world of magic and nature. This tends to reinforce stereotypes, especially when the villainess is villified for wanting to be a man, but who cares when you're having this much fun."
3,Number 2 has a fixation with number 2s,"Weatherwoman Returns is not as surreal and folklorish as the original, adopting a more conventional narrative with merely unconventianal story elements. What is it with those bananas? Enjoyable, though not for the same reasons as The Weatherwoman- it's so ridiculous, it's good. (Yes, it is more preposterous than the first, because it is framed almost like a docu-drama instead of a supernatural fantasy.) The humour is certainly the most extremely toilet driven I have seen, and is mostly cringeworthy, though the final scenes are laugh out loud funny."
4,The Inflamation free diet plan,"I have switched to this diet for about 5 weeks and have already noticed a difference! This plan is easier to follow because it allows me to calculate the inflammation properties of my own diet as opposed to forcing me to follow somebody else s died, especially since I have other fairly serious health concerns that I must watch through careful manipulation of my diet, IE wheat allergy among others!"
2,Kindle version is difficult to navigate,"The book is interesting. I bought the Kindle version, and if I really intended to follow this diet I feel like I would prefer to have a print version. You would need to be constantly referring to the food lists, and I find this very difficult to do on the Kindle. I do have an older Kindle, the kind with the keyboard at the bottom. I don't know if a newer Kindle would make a difference."
2,Contradictory,"I love the concept of this book, but the numbers at times contradict other sources (like the IF rating system on the Self Nutrition Data online). I would have more confidence in the data if I could verify it online, but I often end up with more questions than answers. This is a huge problem when researching nutritional information: if you're looking up protein content of a certain food, for example, you can find different answers from different--even trusted--websites. While I have a lot of respect for the author, I'm not sure who to believe at this point. Maybe for the next edition, a fact-checker can go through the numbers and verify them."
4,finaly,It fit right on the fourwheeler and mounted the winch on it with out any problems it did what it said it would
5,works,"Having just switched to a gluten free diet I wanted to start on a fiber productRenew life came very highy reccomended. Everything going well. I can tell when I skip a day.I don't know if the oatbran in here is gluten free, so I will be switching after I am through with thisbottle.If you don't need to avoid gluten I reccomend this."
2,Not enough fiber for the price,"the product is fine, but for less money, I switched to organic chia seeds and ground flax seed. I just couldn't justify using the tablets as it takes 5 capsules to get the same amount of fiber in non-capsulated products."
3,"Great unit, if it doesn't break on you!","We bought two. One for the Best Man and one for the Maid of Honor at our wedding. The units were getting rave reviews until one broke. It didn't even last a month, and now Creative refuses to replace or repair it. This has been going on for over a month now and no action on has been taken Creative's part, except to refuse to provide any support. Given the opportunity I would buy, and recommend to you, someone else's product based upon the support we have recieved."
3,Good sound quality but user interface needs improvement,"Overall the Nomad IImg is a good player. The audio quality is great and the FM radio feature is a real plus. However the device has a number of annoying design flaws. All of the controls are located on the side panels of the player making it very difficult to use when running or working out. Moreover, the ""erase"" button is located prominently causing not just a few instances of ""oh my god I almost...""Also, I learned the hard way that you cannot overcharge the batteries. I left my device on the charger too long and it sizzled the batteries. Off the shelf batteries do not work in the charger and I had to order a new set of Creative's own rechargeables. Again, nothing major just slightly annoying.Once you get past these small problems the player works fine. I just hope someone in their user interface or design department considers how people actually use these devices in real life."
5,Survived 3 airlines U.S. to Asia and back,"I didn't check my case in as I just don't trust the airlines. If their security personnel don't rummage through your luggage and steal things, (I had a dvd go missing this time) they lose it. But I would have no problems checking it in otherwise. My gear was secure and protected. I had two cameras, lenses, filters and other items and all my gear made it back perfectly safe. All the gear was exactly where I put it when I opened it. It's stylish and I even received compliments on it. The handle collapses and releases quickly for those moments of nagivating stairs or escalators and the wheels rolled with ease. My wife even used it as a stool. Overall an excellent case that will survive whatever the airlines throw at it (other than theft or losing it)."
3,Near the end...,"Okay, this is certainly not BOA's best album, but it still has some good moments.Some might prefer ""Balls of Fire"", I think they're very close...The songs are quite short, and so is the album.The solos are reduced to the minimum but straight to the point.Dandy and Aldridge still give some good energy."
2,"Great design, but _terribly_ slow","I love the design. The keys feel great. The printouts are crisp. The display is easy to read. It has a small footprint.But its _so slow_! It's like it's trying to strike every character, even blanks, across the tape. The 2.1 lines per second that it quotes must be when you hit the linefeed button.I hit one digit and struck the Plus key five times in rapid succession (it _does_ cache your keystrokes fortunately). It took five seconds for that one number to be added five times. It took seven seconds to hit Plus five times followed by the Total key."
1,"Due to the inferior components, after 3 years of use, it is now useless","The plastic started cracking within the first year of purchase and after 3 years it is rendered completely unusable. While the motor has always been strong the plastic bowl and components have cracked and finally have rendered it useless. I took care if it as per manufacturers recommendation and never put it in the dishwasher (hassle) I bought this one to replace a Cuisinart that I had for nearly 10 years. The price is high and the quality is sub-par. I will purchase a Kitchen-Aid, my friend has one and the components are very well made. Cuisinart you have lost my faithful business.PS. I would like to ""recycle"" be replacing the damaged pieces, yet the replacement components are priced so high that it is not worth purchasing them..... I am completely dissatisfied!"
4,Works great,When we got this processor we used it to shred enough zucchini to make 20 loafs of zucchini bread and it works perfectly. The only drawback is that you have to purchase a separate storage thing to hold all the blades.
1,plastic parts don't hold up,"I had a Little Pro for 20 years and it worked flawlessly with frequent use. Clearly Cuisinart has cheaped out on the plastic parts (bowl, chute, etc.) because my DFP-14 only lasted a month or two before there were hairline cracks everywhere. Customer service didn't want to replace any of the parts for me - they wanted to sell me new (presumably equally crappy) replacements. Ugh."
4,Mine is close to 5 years old and working perfectly!,"I've had this machine for close to 5 years. It's excellent.I had to special order it back then, and it was well worth it.I've processed various doughs in it - fairly tough doughs thatcontain nuts that usually make other processors stall or burn out quitequickly.Back when I made my own bread (I've had to drop gluten from my dietsince that time) I kneaded bread dough with this processor and itdid a very good job. Kneading by hand was rough on my shouldersand wrists, so it was such a relief to use this machine instead.This size is Cuisinart's largest, which surprises me. I don'tprocess huge amounts of ingredients at a time, yet I know that having a smallermachine would be frustrating for me.It's a beautiful looking unit, too. I like to display it on mycountertop."
3,14 cup vs 7 cup,"So this claims to be a 14 cup food processor, and it is. I have an old DLC-7 Unit, the 7 is for cups. I ordered this thinking It was going to be twice the size. Nope. The old unit was 7 cups up to the internal spindle, i.e. how much liquid you could put in the bowl before it overflowed down the middle, the new unit is 14 cups if you put a plug in the middle spindle hole and fill the bowl to the outside rim - or solid capacity. I had a job to do that needed a 14 cup liquid capacity. I had no time to return this, the job needed done.Ended up I have 14 cup capacity - just had to use both my old unit and the new one at the same time.Be aware before you buy."
5,My Amazing Cuisinart Food Processor!!!!,"I am so happy with my new Cuisinart 14 cup Food Processor!! Now, I use it all the time. I even gave it a prominent spot on my kitchen counter top! It's become one of my most valuable,every day kitchen appliances. In fact, I don't know how I functioned without it!"
4,Great Product.,"I normally hate cooking and all that it entails but this helps make it actually a bit fun! That's a biggie for me to say that! I rated it a 4 star-nothing's perfect. And it was a bit tricky to at first get use to but after that, no problem. Thanks so much!"
3,there is one little wrong information about the product,"I didn't watch that dvd yet but about to. but I want to say there is only three discs in dvd, not four. just let everyone know."
5,Works better than pills...,"I have tried everything from Midol to Vicoden to holistic approaches but I could never curb the pain if my periods. I even cramp when I ovulate... These little drops make me completely forget that I'm even on my period. They get rid of breast tenderness, back pain, fatigue... They taste a bit like celery; I quite enjoy the taste. Some of my girlfriends don't really like the flavor but for them, it could taste like butt and they would drink it because IT WORKS. What I love the most is that there are some $20 proprietary drops that a famous holistic Dr. sells... These work better and are more affordable. 1oz bottle lasts a lot longer than you'd think at 30 drops 3x a day... Around 3 months or so, maybe longer. I am hooked forever. :)"
3,It's just not for my style.,"When I purchased this Canon case, Amazon did not have a picture available yet. So I gambled.Here is my personal verdict. The case is made of good leather quality and looks elegant. From distant one might think it is a purse for the ladies. Inside it has two pockets for storage of memory cards and another for a spare battery.This case lacks a shoulder strap (duh!). To substitute the shoulder strap the wrist strap of the camera (mine is a S-10) is then used when the camera sits tightly in the case and its strap hangs outside at one side of the case. The flap, when closed, leaves its sides uncovered. In my opinion, dirt or water splashes can easily enter here and damage the toy.I'm looking for a new product."
4,It's a bit too tight.,"I have an S100 in it, and it fits very snugly. There is room for an extra memory card and that's all. I like it, but I would have made it just a little less of a squeeze."
4,Good travel bag,"My wife and I bought this bag prior to a 2 week Alaska vacation including many planes, trains, and automobiles. Worked like a dream. We have a Nikon D80 that we brought two lenses for as well as an I book laptop that fits well. The sectioned compartments suited our needs well as we traveled. Only complaint would be that I wish it had waist/chest straps to relieve tension on the shoulders when carrying a large load. Overall a very useful bag and we're happy with the purchase."
3,Lacks Consistency...,"I bought this backpack for my gf last year and it was so awesome that I just bought one for myself. Side by side, mine is a tad bit smaller/tighter. I used hers for a few trips and was able to easily put my 19"" HP laptop in it (despite other reviews regarding this), so I felt very comfortable ordering the same pack for my new 16"" laptop, which barely fits in the new backpack.My only guess for this is that NG has outsourced this bag to a different (Chinese) manufacturer, as the color is slightly off and the size is tighter/smaller. I'm sure, overall, NG is reliable, but who knows how well they're watching the tolerances in the manufacturing process. In my experience, Chinese manufacturers allow much more tolerance in their process than typical American manufacturers.Nonetheless, it's a great pack, with lots of pockets, rugged integrity, and very comfortable."
2,I bought 2 and 1 quit working after the first month,"The USB transmitter no longer communicates with the mouse, so basically I have to go through the hassle of exchanging or returning. The other mouse I bought (exactly the same kind) works great and looks good too. Go figure."
4,Aptly titled CD!!,"Uber cool UK female trio Sugababes return with their fourth CD, `Taller in more ways'. Produced largely by US producers like Dallas Austin (Lead off UK #1 single the driving pop of `Push the button' and The TLC channelling `Ugly'; lyrically similar to `Unpretty', musically similar to `Damaged', to mention a few), and Gus Sigswood (the catchy jerky pop of `Bruised' which was co-written by Cathy `Kylie & Britney' Dennis). The CD has already proved to be a smash hit in the UK earning them their first #1 album.The CD has more acoustic flourishes than previous Sugababes releases, but still with loads of synths, electronic tweets and bleeps, and sweet harmonies. It shows real growth, musically and vocally. Other standouts are the sweet atmospheric ballad `Follow me home', the rock laced `Joy division', `Ace reject', `Better' and the lovely mid tempo`2 hearts' with great hollow percussion and swirling strings.Another winning CD from the babes and one of the coolest pop CDs of the year."
5,The most amazing NASCAR Scanner made,"This scanner is absolutely amazing. You can download a list of frequencies online for all the NASCAR drivers, then simply upload them to your scanner... it takes 10 seconds and saves you hours upon hours programming by hand. This scanner also has text so you can glance down at the scanner to see exactly who is talking at the races. It's awesome!!!"
4,The civil war,"If you are expecting a book full of Civil War patterns, think again. This delightful book is first and foremost a Civil War diary as seen from a woman s point of view.It is very moving to read their stories about their love for their families, their fears and their political views at the time.Well worth the read.Yes the patterns are there but have to be traced and have seams added etc. by you. Time consuming but if you are happy to do this then very rewarding.SuzieAustralia"
1,Huge Dissapointment,"My daughters and I are studying the Civil War this year and I thought it would be fun to make a quilt using patterns from the era. This book has lots of pretty quilt blocks, but no patterns or instructions to make them. The quilt blocks are given names based on the diary entry they correspond to and no mention of the modern or proper name is given which would have made finding patterns far more helpful. If you want to make your own templates and then scissor cut each piece then you could use this book, but for the modern quilter used to dimensions and a rotary cutter it is useless. I recommendQuilts from the Civil War: Nine Projects, Historic Notes, Diary Entriesinstead."
1,dated techniques,"Techniques are dated, and do not lend themselves to creative or scrappy use of fabrics. The most fatal flaw is that the cut, sew, cut approach used in this book leaves bias edges on assembled modules, which is always a nightmare to work with without stretching or getting wrinkles."
1,Terrible detector,This detector does not work like it is supposed to. I got a ticket while using the same model.
3,"Classic album, bad mix","This recording is a classic. Every song is good, but the sound quality is poor on this particular CD. I don't know what it is. Indie reggae CDs have this habit of careless mixes that have a lot of background noise. Anoyne who buys a lot of reggae music will recognize the rough sound on this CD as representative of that. It's really frustrating because good quality mixes are out there. For example, the song ""Two Sevens Clash"" is pristine on the ""various artists"" box set, The Story of Jamaican Music, so you know there's clean tape out there. Why is it, then, that Sanachie's release here sounds so rough? I give this five-star album only three stars because Sanachie messed it up."
1,The Austrians,"This book was literally unreadable. I put it down after 20 pages or so (a rarity for me) and bemoaned the money I spent to purchase it. My interest was real considering a pending trip to that part of the world coupled with my low knowledge of the history of the area. But there has to be a better way to gain knowledge than have to plow through this dense, poorly written, tome of words. Yuck."
3,Silver Wire Jewelry,"It's a little hard to follow, and it seems like some of the instructions are incomplete."
2,Pretty Awful,"I'm coming from a musician's perspective, so fair warning.With that in mind: This thing sounds absolutely awful. Obviously fake instruments, outdated synths, simplisitic arrangements. Still, if you want karaoke versions of the songs from the show, it gets the job done. We actually ended up finding the songs on other discs because I couldn't stand the way they sounded on this disc."
3,Satisfactory,"I found the arrangements either outstanding or tacky. If you have a karaoke player, this CDG is an excellent way to learn the lyrics to the songs. Personally, I would have paid more for better arrangements."
4,Legs don't lock well,"Great tripod for the price. It is sturdy and quite compact. Fits nicely in my backpack while hiking. My biggest problem is with the legs. Unless they are all fully extended, they don't like to lock in place. This makes it very difficult when trying to set it up on eneven surfaces. It is great when fully extended. I am about 5'8"" and find it comfortable to use without having to bend or slouch too much."
4,Light and tight!,"Very small and lightweight are overwhelmingly the reasons to buy this tripod. Yes, it is difficult (or impossible) to have the legs extend to anything but full height. But, this is not a big problem for me."
2,"Compact and lightweight, while it lasts",If you need this for use with a small camera for travel this is an okay one. Mine didnt work quite well with a Panasonic Fz15 camera. It was not stable on the ground. Dont even think of using this with an SLR. And SLR is worth much more that what you save with this.
5,Great for on the go,Now I can actually be in some of my pictures when I'm on the go...great portable product!
2,"SEX,Masturbation and perverse","No subtitle options, mostly about sex and temptations, not a great plot. Sound track not clear enough, needs subtitles. twisted."
5,Artemesia is sensational,Well acted and true to the history of women in Art. Artemesia is not for the feint hearted and must be restricted for those of younger years or delicate taste. It is however a true depiction of an example of the neglect of talented women artists by mainstream society and historical reflections. Artemesia was a very brave individual who truly sacrificed for her art.
2,Bummer.,"I've been doing a lot of research about the artist Artemisia Gentileschi, and this movie really doesn't fit the historical data that we do have about this amazing artist and woman.It's a beautiful movie, but the facts are just wrong, especially concerning her rape by her tutor, Agostino Tassi. It is unfortunate that the filmmakers chose to portray her in this light, because she was such an amazing, talented, and strong woman. This movie really dampens her strength and determination by making her into a seductress instead of a victim."
2,"AESTHETICLY PLEASING, BUT INACCURATE","A typical paen of self-adoration that results when a film is made by artists, about artists, for artists. The title character's neurotically self-absorbed and abrasive behaviour is glorifed due to the fact that she's an artist and, being part of that group's self proclaimeded elite status, her actions are romanticized rather than receiving the contempt that such behaviour usually warrants. While this film is beautifully shot, it's more of a theoretical (or more accurately, mythological) ideal of the struggling artist held back by the lack of vision of those around them, rather than an attempt at accurrate biography. Among other things, the artist accused of raping her was actually around the same age as her father, but in the film he's a more agreeably youthful middle-aged man with somewhat attractive looks. Apparently artists, especially those who made this film, are like politicians in that they prefer what's useful to what's true."
1,this movie was worse then any B movie I've ever seen,"Wow, what a low budget piece of garbage this was! I'm guessing that the people giving this movie anything over one star must be friends and family of the loser that produced it. The only entertainment that my girlfriend and I got out of it was watching it burn and melt after throwing it in the fireplace!"
1,It 's a piece of crap,"I just got it last week and already it is crewing up in Windows 95. The driver is terrible. The print quality sucks (600 dpi my ass), the copy qulaity is useless. Absolutely no support at Brother. Save your money."
2,Lacks Windows NT Driver,"The specifications for this printer suggest that you can use it with Windows NT, but according to Brother, the driver is not available and never will be. You will have to use a PCL 4 driver which is very slow or resort to the driver that ships with the unit, which, in many cases simply doesn't ever produce a printout on complex pages.Furthremore, I have been unable to find a way to reset the print queue in the middle of a print job. Pulling the power cord seems to be an effective solution, however, you will need to reset the spooler service on your NT Server as well.If you intend to share a single phone line for inbound fax and data, the distinctive ring feature on this unit is its only redemption."
3,Darth Vader Statue by Gental Giant,"This is an awesome display of the great Dark sith Lord. It comes in three pieces (Statue base, Vader, & Light saber). You place a pegged foot into the display base. You then place his light saber into hand and that's it. No lights or sound, but just the statue by it's self is a powerful display in any room that commands respect. I would recommend this if you are a series Star Wars fan. I only paid $45 after shipping & handling. Sorry but I think you will be hard pressed to find this deal."
5,Electronic Musician - Geary Yelton,"Geary Yelton, associate editor for the world renowned magazine Electronic Musician recently wrote about the new Moog Voyager synthesizer; in which Ehron Vonallen designed a sound in the synth called Bass for E. Vonallen.he stated:""I spent some time exploring the Performer model`s standard Presets. Of all the bass Presets, In the Pocket and Bass for E. Vonallen are my favorites; both are definite blasts from the past, and certainly the most authentic Moog basses I`ve ever heard""Geary YeltonEM Magazine"
1,"Fiction, not science.","I don't mind blending a little fiction with a bit of science to make an interesting movie, but when you are making a biography of Einstein, it would be nice to at least get the explanation of E=mc2 right. In the movie it says that he proved mathematically that if mass moves at the speed of light squared it turns into energy! AARRGGHH! Just for the record, according to Einstein, nothing goes faster than the speed of light."
5,Great satire on the 80's and the business world,"Great satirical take on an excellent book. James Garner nails Ross Johnson and his desire to takeover his company. Jonathan Pryce makes an excellent Henry Kravis. The supporting characters are very good, too. Funny, sad, sometimes intense. If you haven't read the book yet, the video can help you understand it in a superficial way and will probably make you want to pick it up to get the gory details of how it all came about. Of course, the book is much more straightforward in it's approach.The video really lampoons the greed of the 1980's and makes the viewer wonder whatever became of the smokeless cigarette."
2,Doesn't do Justice to the book,An average movie with average performances. Glosses over many of the details in the book and ignores the role of many important characters. It wont appeal much to the general audience and neither will it satisfy the people who have already read the book.
2,Pan pops out! Extras dispenser sticks...,"So, this is my second Breadman. I returned the first after 3 weeks becasue the pan would pop up while kneading, espeically those tougher doughs like whole wheat. I would have to babysit it and relock it in when it came out. Came down once in the am to find my bread half mixed, but cooked through....what a mess!I returned that one thinking it was a fluke (b/c when it did make bread, it was wonderful).The second one had the same problem. Called Customer Service...very nice lady called me back, reading from a manual that I should try to bend the little metal clips a bit to get a better lock. Tried it, didn't work. Furthermoe, once a used raisons in the 'extras' dispenser, and not the thing sticks and con't relase other things into the bread (had to scrape out rosemary from there...ug).Looking for a new brand and new machine."
5,Great breadmaker!,"I purchased this breadmaker because it was a decent price and it had many difference baking options including Gluten Free. While many breadmakers just can't quite master the gluten free breads, this one gave me perfect loaves every time! It was quiet and didn't shake around the counter like some other brands. The pan never popped out for me. I haven't had any issues with it and I have been using it regularly for about 8 months."
1,Not Sugar Free!,"Read carefully, this is NOT sugar free, it kind of aggravated me because of the title for the order. The product is delicious, I like it but thought it was LOW (NOT) Sugar and LOW (NOT NOT NOT) calorie. Please change the title!"
1,Deceived,I can't believe I wasted money on season 2 when I wanted series 1. I couldn't be more upset at Amazon for not clarifying the offer. I've had this on pre-order for months and naturally assumed that season 1 meant season 1.
1,Poorly organized and poorly written,"It's hard too imagine a worse organized or written book on bridge bidding. Most of the information you want is contained in the book, but it is presented in a totally illogical fashion. Some material directly copied from earlier books. Terms are introduced without definition. A beginner would be totally lost. Very disappointing."
2,impossible to get on with no bubbles,I could never get this on with no bubbles; ended up having to clean it and finally abandoned it.
4,Performs as advertised,"This product arrived promptly, installed quite easily, performed as advertised and is adjustable to boot. I wish all items that I sought were straightforward like this."
2,In addition..,"I would like to mential, also, that without that terribly uncomfortable and useless slab of foam in the middle the ""gel"" material is very comfortable. The problem with taking it out and using it is that they just don't put enough of it in. They would need at least 2 x and maybe even 3 x as much of that material. I had to fold it in half to double the thickness in order to be comfortable. I must say that if this company took out that crappy foam insert and put more gel in this would be the most comfortable pillow I've ever had and would earn 5 stars. I hope LCM home reads this cos I would definitely buy it."
2,OK pillow,"I bought these for pillows in our guest rooms. They're ok, but too wimpy & squishy for me. Won't buy them again"
5,Small and Mighty,"This short but very well written book is a must for anybody wanting to learn more about the google way.It provides all pertinent information,in a very well organized way that the reader can follow."
1,Too Simple,"Google Online Help section regurgitated. A very simple book, not even useful for the inexperienced. Google Help (http://www.google.com/help/index.html) is better."
4,OKay. Good.,I am a Search Engine Optimization and Link Buidling Expert Myself. I bought this book and I must say that this book is a good read for newbees and those who are trying to get into this arena of business. Though you need to learn a lot more. More about me at http://www.nakulgoyal.com
3,"Small book. A little hard to read, but informational.","The book is not very big. It looks like the pages have been photo copied on a printer that is running out of ink, so it is a bit difficult to read, but the information is fine."
2,not pure seeds,"Yes, the seeds are good, but they're unfiltered, so there's a lot of debris mixed in, a lot of twigs and leaves. Me, I'd rather pay more for the filtered."
5,Fabulous,"Hillberry explains his careful and meticulous methods in this generous book. I was really surprised how far I could get, quickly, by taking some of the advice offered here. The book itself is gorgeous, filled with beautiful reproductions of the author's often-amazing work. If you're looking for advice or inspiration to help take your drawing to the next level, you can't go wrong with this book."
5,Children in art,"I Love this book! This book is a wonderful addition to any childhood class room, or for children who engage in any type of art. This book shows children from all around the world engaging in all different aspects of art. Art is an important part of every culture. This book really captures just that."
2,"Not very helpful, at least for Salt Lakers","I was so bummed not to love this book. I think the book itself is a great idea because hiking is one of those things that can be really difficult with kids but, with the right trail, can be wonderful. So two stars for a great idea.However, Keilty (I can't help but notice the closeness of her name to Kelty--a hiking parent's best friend) only includes nine ""hikes"" in the Salt Lake area, three of which are Old Deseret Village, City Creek, and Red Butte Garden--all very lovely nature/history walks, which we frequent, but not really what I'm looking for when I want to really immerse myself in unpaved nature, you know?I just think it's a waste of a LOT of incredible hiking options in the Salt Lake area mountains. Maybe it is more useful for other parts of the state. I'm going to get a standard guide to Salt Lake's trails and just look for kid-friendly ones."
5,Powerful...Praise worthy!,"This CD is powerful! Gideon is talented, versatile and anointed! The CD is divided into 4 segments: praise, intimacy, worship & celebration. It ushers you into the presence of God, then lifts your spirits so high you can't help but celebrate. Gideons passion for God and His message is very evident. The lyrics are real. The music is pumped. The message is powerful.They remind me of R&B group Mint Condition and gospel group Commissioned. Gideon band is just what we need -- young or old!"
1,STOP! THIS IS NOT 100% ALOE,"I'm writing amazon about this FALSE ADVERTISING.The top of their page says ""Fruit Of The Earth 100% Aloe Vera Gel"" but the bottle does not contain 100% aloe, it contains a gel which has a bunch of (possibly dangerous) additives added to it!Shame on Fruit of the Earth for putting all this crap which MIGHT BE carcinogenic in their aloe which people use because they want a NATURAL product.I'd give this 0 stars if I could!"
1,Irritated my skin,Even though this product is not %100 percent aloe vera gel i tried it anyway to clear up face pimples. The real aloe vera gel is known to clear up face pimples and acne but this stuff left my face swollen and puffy and i will not buy again. its not %100 percent aloe vera gel and now im growing a real aloe vera leaf plant and that leaf heals skin problems better than fruit of the earth products. i recommend a real aloe vera leaf
2,What does 100% Gel mean? What percentage is actual Aloe?,"The text on the bottle is a little misleading. 100% Gel? Well, yes, it is. But what percent of Aloe Vera is IN the gel? 20%? 90%? You will never know, because they won't tell you. Also, this stuff contains Diazolidinyl Urea, which is a preservative that prevents bacterial growth. It works by releasing small amounts of formaldehyde, a toxic and carcinogenic substance used to embalm dead bodies. So there you are. Better if you look for Aloe from a company named ""JASON"", from Jason Natural Products.Jason Aloe Vera 98% Moisturizing Gel, 8-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3)"
4,Jim Carrey Classic,Perhaps the best movie Jim Carrey ever done. Easily the beginning of what turned out to be a great career.
2,keep shopping if you have opposable thumbs,"It's great that you won't burn yourself when you pick up a heavy, hot pan. But suddenly, unable to keep a natural grip, you will drop the pot on your foot and break a bone or 20 (the human foot has many bones).My son, who is otherwise a great person, bought me this mitt. I will return it because it is so hard to use. It forces my thumb into an unnatural position which is not conducive to grasping, let alone lifting. I have it in mind to give him a stern talking-to."
4,Effective but awkward.,The orka offers superior heat resistance but is a bit stiff and awkward to use.A good addition to your oven mitt collection -keep your fabric ones though.
3,Not for grabbing small items,"It works fine for holding a roaster pan, or the handle of a fry pan, but not for grabbing small items, such as a small knob on a pan cover, or a small piece of food, or picking up something small on a flat surface. I am a female with a medium sized hands and when I wear it, there's about an inch of space between my finger/thumb and the top of the mitt. Once the item is between the area of my fingers and thumb, the mitt can hold it pretty well, but to get the item into the area between my fingers and thumb can be a challenge, and in some cases, a total impossibility. For example, I find it easy to pick a corn cob floating in a potful of hot water, but if I were to pick one from a pile of corn cobs it would be very difficult. Don't even think about picking a kernel of corn from the table. In other words, if you need to grab or pick up something with the tip of your fingers and your hands are small to medium, you can't use this mitt."
2,"Better than standard mitt, but not worth the price","These silicon Orka oven mitts are better than your traditional fabric-based oven mitt. However, I have felt uncomfortable heat upon contact with oven-temperature metal for more than 2 seconds. This mitt is by no means impervious to oven-temperature heat. I also think that ""glove"" style hot-hands with fingers are much better than ""mitten"" style hot-hands as they allow one to grab unwieldy items much more easily."
2,Plastic Over Mitt - very large.,A little bit cumbersome and takes up a lot of space in the drawer. The heat comes through after a minute or so. Wouldn't buy another one.
4,Great Product for the sale price...,"I had left a cast iron skillet in the over for like 20 min's on 475 degrees, the glove didn't start to feel warm and I held it for 1 minute. nice product!"
2,Too big,These are cute but the twin fitted sheet does not fit snuggly on a twin size mattress. It is very large. I returned it once thinking they sent me the full sheet and when I got it the second time it was very large again. Very disappointed. Fitted sheets are supposed to fit snuggly not only for comfort but for safety. Beware of this when purchasing this item.
3,Didn't solve problem... which may not be fault of product,"I have a Nordic Track C1800i that squeaks, and customer service told me to use ONLY Performant lube on it. I purchased 2 tubes, so I'd have a spare. I didn't think that Nordic Track Customer service had my problem diagnosed accurately, and that my real problem is not the belt... and I was right. The lube decreased some of the squeaking, but not by much (I think it's with the rollers or elsewhere). BUT IT TAKES TWO TUBES, NOT ONE, TO LUBRICATE MY TREADMILL. I used it all."
2,Not satisfying,"As I read this ""mystery"", I wondered many times if Sue Henry really wrote this. It seemed like more of a travel guide for Taos than a mystery. I found it a struggle to get through this one even though I have read and enjoyed all her Alaska mysteries and the first Maxie and Stretch. The actual mystery didn't start until about half way through and there wasn't much time spent on it until the surprise quickie ending which wrapped it all up. I hope the next one is better."
1,streets only.,"there was absolutely no thought behind the construction of this book.(forget about location by association) it's only listed by number and location,forget about town or location"
2,Just not cool.,"Other reviewers were generous. I respect that.I'm not much of a hater, but this product made me mad. I can't imagine the inventors actually film. The casters switch directions in the middle of a motion in any direction. I practiced over and over, and it kept doing the same thing.I didn't end up using it for quite a while after I bought it, for various reasons. After one use, realizing it was useless to me, I smashed it for some anger release. I will say it worked quite effectively for that purpose."
2,Disappointingly Basic,"I had great hopes for this book, written by one of the consultants who helped make Cindy Jackson (of _Living Doll_ fame, known for having transformed herself into a beauty by an effort of will) what she is today. However, the information contained in this book was very, very basic stuff that repeats itself every few months in fashion magazines: make sure your nails are in good repair before an interview, wear clothes that fit, etc. There really isn't much in this book about what it means to create, convey, and maintain a personal brand identity.Weirdest tip: if you have clammy hands, carry a can of spray deodorant around and dose yourself before you have to shake hands."
3,frazetta documentary,"i bought this thinking it was going to be an art book... you know, some sort of collection of works. turns out is more of a documentary about how frazetta got started and different jobs he had and different comics he drew. there were actually a surprising number of comic related pages. there's not really that much art... what there is was sort of a let down. if you're collecting frazetta books, add it to the collection. if you want an art gallery, this aint it.""death dealer"" not pictured. major let down, in my opinion."
4,"For the money this fax is a ""work horse""","I was amazed at the high quality fax output that came from this machine. It is not advertised with major bells and whistles, however, the features it does have are very nice. Don't expect to be a local 'copy' center, but for the occasional copy, it does a fine job. I would prefer an ink cartridge, but you can't have it all."
1,Constant paper jamming problems- beware,I've had this model fax for about 4 years now and have been plagued by paper jamming--very frustrating. I found it worked best with 24 lb paper but still I need a more dependable fax and cannot deal with having to clear paper jams every couple of days.Because of this I'm giving this fax away for free and getting the HP 1040.
5,"Availability of Method Hand Wash, Go Naked (no fragrance)","It is difficult for those of us with allergies/sensitivities to perfumes to get products without fragrances added. I was unable to get it at the local store, though they originally carried it. So I was pleased to find it at Amazon for a competitive price. It arrived promptly and with six bottles will last a long time!Method Hand Wash, Go Naked, 12-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6)"
4,I like the scent.,It's your usual hand soap. It doesn't disappoint. Not too drying (although it's not moisturizing either). The smell is nice. The bottle is aesthetically pleasing.
3,Regular Liquid Soap,"I bought the 12-ounce bottle of Method Green Tea & Aloe soap over 2 weeks ago, and after using it I can tell that it is just like any other liquid soap that you can find in the reputable supermarket. This soap is more expensive compared to the other liquid soaps like Softsoap or Dial, but it cleans just as the cheaper soaps. The bottle sure looks good, but this is about it."
5,good book,This book is a really good book for the people out there that like to camp.I thought it was an amazing book and I would recommend it to all my friends.
1,the price does not match the one listed on the box,I bought this item and gave it as a gift to my nephew. My brother said there was a price printed on the box which was 10 USD. But Amazon sold it for more than 10 USD... I was somewhat embarrassed because I told my brother it was bought more than 10 USD when I gave it as a gift.
4,Works well for me,"I needed a lamp to fit in my new computer desk hutch, so it couldn't be too tall, but I wanted more adjustability and a heavier base than the usual cheapo gooseneck. This fits the bill nicely but it is a little pricey (why I only gave 4 stars). I use a CFL bulb (energy savings!) with it. The only thing that would make it better is if they included a power outlet in the base."
3,This is an old book with a new title,"If you already own ""Color (The Essential Style Guides, Vol 2)"" by Joanna Copestick and Meryl Lloyd, DO NOT buy this book! The pictures and text in both are virtually identical! I don't know why Ms Copestick would reissue her old book with a new name. It certainly isn't fair to those of us who supported her by buying her earlier book.If you don't own her earlier book, however, this is a worthwhile book to own. The pictures are very attractive, thoughtfully laid out and accompanied by interesting text. The pictures Ms Copestick uses combine modern and antique furniture with aplomb and invigorate the mix with exciting color."
5,Nice and Warm for the Price,These arrived on time and in good shape. Actually nicer than in picture. Warm and comfortable since they stretch to fit your hands. Slight shine to them makes them look a little darker black. Will go nicely with most outerwear.
5,Call to action,"Dave Goetz provides a humorous and sometimes caustic look at living the suburban Christian life. By examining our distractions and life motives, Dave calls readers to action - action to courageously step into the deeper waters of a meaningful Christian spiritual life.Dr. Jeffrey Wincel (D.Min.) author ofClimbing The Mountain of God, The Path to Mystical Discipleship"
1,Waste of my time.,"This book had no real flow to it, quite the choppy read. It had quote after quote and must have been written with a thesaurus nearby. I was very disappointed. I kept waiting for him to get to the point and put it into language that would grip the reader however, it just ran on and on. Upon finally finishing the book, I didn't get the feeling he really grasped the point he was trying to make. My advise to him...move! Flee from the temptations of the 'burbs if you can't find contentment there."
4,enjoyable,I bought the Wii Play primarily for the controller. My husband plays more than I and is completely addicted to the shooting game. Easy good fun.
2,Wii Play (include an extra Wii remote),"OK product; I mainly bought it to have the second remote with the basic Wii package. The games are OK, I would not have purchased them separately."
2,Wii Play,"The game is OK, but don't think that you will be wildly addicted to it. Its more fun with multi players. You can't use you Mii for this game either, but at least you get a controller with this bundle."
1,only worth the free controller,my husband and I got this because of the games and the free controller it came with...we are wishing we had just bought another controller and a seperate game. THESE GAMES ARE TERRIBLE!
4,One of the few bargains in the Wii arena,One of the few bargains in the Wii arena. It gives you the Wiimote plus the extra games. It's better than buying these separately. Kids love the games-no surprise there.
2,Lacking,This game is sad to say boring as all get out... The only game you would want to play more than once would be the tank game all the others get old fast. The only upside to this game is the Wiimote!
3,Okay for the price,"This package comes with a extra remote that is great. So if you take the actual cost of the remote $39 from your purchase, additional $10 is the cost of the 9 games in the DVD. You get the games worth that value. Kids will enjoy the Mii, Cow racing, Fishing. You will like shooting and pool and neon hockey. Couple of others games viz. Table tennis and war game are kind of crap."
4,Much better deal than buying the remote only :),"If you love the games that came along with the Wii, you'll very likely these additional games! My favorite of the bunch are the target shooting (try playing a '2 player' game by yourself and hold both remotes so it's like you're holding 2 pistols! very fun!) and the laser hockey. If you're buying a Wii system, it comes with only one remote/control so you're going to need at least another one to play with/against a friend (if not 3 more for a party/4 person game) so you might as well get this package. A remote/control alone costs $40, so spending the extra $10 for this is a great deal because these games are well worth $10!"
5,A Bang For Your Buck.,"In a time at this very moment when Wii remotes are on high demand and many are sold out I discovered this deal. You actually can't beat it. I was looking for a remote and who knows how long you will have to wait to find one that I saw this addition and couldn't resist. I was shocked to see that the remote comes with a the glove and strap and batteries which is awesome! Aside from that the game is another fine addition. It is bascially a training game where you play nine games to test your skills with the remote and see how good you have control over it. The games are really fun. The price of 49.99 is just right because you are really paying for the game and the remote is free. Frankly, I did it more for the remote but when I played the game I knew it was a great buy! Two items for the price of one aint bad. So if you can't find the Wii remote anywhere this would be your best bet as an altertive solution."
3,What do you expect for 10 bucks more than a controller alone?,"There's some pretty fun games in there as well as a couple corny and boring ones (the 2 Mii games especially). Every time you play you get the same set of levels each time each time so it gets boring after a while. The 3 games that really make it worth it is Laser Hockey (similar to pong but much better), Billiards, and Tanks. You get to actually play someone or the CPU (except for Billiards you're on your own if you play by yourself) so it's different every time. If you want a second controller this is the way to go, if you just want the games, it's not really worth it unless you can find the games really cheap (as in, 10 bucks)."
3,Not much action,"I got this game just after I got the WII mainly for the remote (game is $10 basically) but it's not very action oriented. It's a sit on the couch point the remote at the screen-not like WII sports-where you can get more into action and burn calories. If you are a couch potato, I would recommend it."
3,Simple but fun,I'd have to say to enjoy this game you have to have a sense of humor. Those in it for some awesome game will be disappointed. However if you are up for some laughs it'll keep you in stitches.The game is meant as a way to learn various uses of the remote. It accomplishes that with loads of laughs.
5,WII Fun,"This was such a bargain , and we have really enjoyed using it. We are new to Wii games but these were a good way to try them. We would have paid this much for just the remote too.We will continue to look for this games accessories on Amazon."
2,Poo!,"Ok awesome having another control!!!!Now about we play. It`s a terrible game, the pool is nice but all games could be better. This game is more ment like a tutorial for people to learn how the controls on the wii works so I think this should come along with wii sports on the console pack."
3,I wish the games were more fun,"I really enjoy cow racing, the tank game, and the duck hunting game. The second two bring back memories of the old Atari/Nintendo versions.Some games are difficult and not very fun. I find it very hard to control where I am shooting in the pool game. It is too easy for the wii remote to go out of sensor range. The rotating stick figure game is quite challenging but isn't very fun. Fishing is so-so when playing solo, but with two players it is too hard to see what is going on. The laser hockey game is very difficult to control the paddle and I wind up knocking the puck into my own goal 70% of the time. I much prefer tennis in Wii Sports to the table tennis in Wii Play.Overall it is of value because of the free remote the enjoyment of some of the mini games."
3,"A great controller, with a mediocre game","I bought Wii Play in hopes that the table tennis would be as much fun as the Wii Tennis on Wii Sports. (That, and it came with a Wii Remote)The ""games"" that come with Wii Play, are mediocre, at best. Some of the 9 are just down right dumb, and completely boring.The highlight, for me, is the ""shooting"" game, which is very much like the old Nintento Duck Hunt. If they released an entire game of just this, I'd be in line to buy it.Overall, if you need another Wii Remote, and want a ""decent"" game for $10 extra, go for the Wii Play. In some cases, Wii Play's easier to find, than a Wii Remote, on its own."
3,Some Replay with Wii Play,"Wii Play is a mixed bag at best. The most entertaining games are Find Mii, Shooting Range and Tanks!. These three games have the most replay value and are quite fun when playing against other players. This weak lineup of games is made up for by the inclusion of the Wii Remote and the biggest selling point."
3,Wii Play Review,"this wii game is not a necessity, but it is a great way to get a new game and a remote at the same time, the games are very elementary."
3,"Extra Wiimote - great; game, not so much","This is worth getting for the extra wiimote, given that it is not that much more in price than getting the wiimote by itself.But keep in mind that the games that come with it are just so-so.In my mind, it's barely worth the extra $10 for the game"
3,It's a great value when purchasing an additional remote,"I mainly purchased Wii Play for the remote and game combo aspect. I'm not overly impressed with the games, they are rather basic and more geared towards improving use and coordination of the wii remotes. A few of the games I do enjoy playing is Laser Hockey (Wii's version of air hockey), Shooting Range (duck hunt like game), pose mii (you have to rotate the Wii remote to match the direction of the mii and use the button to match the mii pose before your time runs out).I recommend purchasing this combo if you are needing an additional remote."
2,Games are really lame,"I wish I would have looked this one up first. Just get the remote, don't bother with the games. They are really lame. You also HAVE to play each of them. If you try to play one, you have to play the ones before it to unlock all of them. Supposedly it is trying to help you learn to use the remote better. Honestly all it did was frustrate me."
5,Another great Nintendo product.,"I bought this game like most people because of the Wii Remote. What other reviewers have said is true, the mini-games are shallow, but nevertheless you can have a lot of fun for a while, specially with multi-player.Right now I'm trying to get the gold medal on all games, which can take some time, and I'm enjoying it. I got to play with my wife a we had a lot of fun. The games we liked best were the tank game, the table tennis game and the laser hockey game. The pool game is also very nice. These mini games gives us a nice idea of how fun other bigger games developed with the same concept can be. Imagine the tanks game with a deep story line, different tank selection, 3D levels... well, you get the picture.As a summary, get it for the Wii remote (normally $39.99) and get this great $10 mini-game collection that illustrates the possible uses of the Wii remote."
1,Fun... for a few minutes.,"I bought this game for the fact that it came with a wiimote. It seems like this should be the only reason you would buy this package.The games get boring, very quickly. I stopped playing it 2 days after I got it. The only game that my niece (who's 13 now) plays is the Where's Waldo-type game.The ping-pong game is impossible, and the others are just boring."
3,Buy for the remote,"I would not pay this much for the game alone. But, bundled with the remote it makes an average deal. Most of the games are pretty dumb. Maybe little kids would enjoy them more."
3,Not much replay value...,"I purchased this for myself as a means of getting an additional Wiimote for my system, back in August. My roommate and I had fun playing through some of the games the first time, but found some (like pool) to be very complicated. She initially had trouble figuring out the Wiimote but after playing through the WiiPlay disk over an hour or so, she felt much more confident. However, we haven't played with it again after the first night. The games just weren't that exciting. It is a two-player game, so it doesn't get brought out at parties or when we have people over like WiiSports (it's closest relative, in terms of ""intro to the Wii"" games). I imagine young kids may find more replay value in it, or people who tend to play the Wii solo or in pairs.I purchased this again for my father in December 07, and it shipped with the new Wiimote jackets."
2,Solitaire Anyone,I purchased this basically for the remote. The games are basically tutorials for the remote. Not much depth or replay value. The kids will get bored fairly quickly.
3,Husker,"This game is fun, but we are still stuck on the Wii sports. The game is a good price because it comes with a controller."
2,Wii Play,"If this game didn't come with the extra controller, I wouldn't recommend it. It just seems like a game to practice pointing with the controller."
3,its okay,"the game itself is alright. It's no wii sports that's for sure. The best thing about this game is that it comes with a controller and for the price, its a bonus. I really only bought it for the controller but surprisingly some of the games are actually pretty good. The billiards and the shooting game are the ones we play, the bubble game and the matching are good for the little ones."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with the limited number of games you can play and the complexity of the billiards game. I did not think the game was worth the price. It would be a great game for $10 with remote, but not for what I paid on here."
4,Good value,"Not super exciting, but it has really gotten used by the children and therefore, it was a very good price."
3,WiiPlay,"Worth the extra 7-10 dollars over buying the remote alone. Gives you 9 games, not the greatest games but they compare to Wii Sports alright. Would recommend this to anyone who wants to buy another controller."
3,"Great service, okay game","The shipping was fast and efficient. The product came in great shape. The game is not that great if you're looking for something equivalent to Wii Sports, but def. something to enjoy once in awhile."
1,don't waste your money,"I thought this would be a deal, a controller and a game. Don't make my mistake, just buy a controller separately. This has to be one of the worst games ever. Completely boring, and non-interactive."
3,okay game but really bought for the remote,I really only needed an extra remote so I bought the wii play bundle. I must admit i was disappointed with the games. At first i went through them unlocking them all as i went. I thought it was some kind of training mode than i realized that WAS the game. If your looking for a bundle to get the extra remote i would suggest wii resort. I gave it 3 stars because my son likes it and it was basically only 10 bucks.
3,Bought it more for controller than games,The games are ok. I bought this more for the controller. I'd imagine that the games would appeal more to the younger crowd. Controller is great. I LOVE the sleeve that comes with it.
2,Eh.,"Not a great game. Much preferred Wii sports that came with the console. The games weren't that fun and if I could do it again, I would just buy the remote and spend $10 on downloading some old NES games using Wii points."
2,For Extra Remote,Wii Play games are really boring but i think it could be fun when you play it with your family or when you throw a party.Basically i got this for the extra remote.
1,These games are terrible,I bought this just to get the wii remote. The games are terrible. If you can get the remote without this game then do it. The games are a waste of time.
3,not as advertize,"I purchased what I thought was Wii play with remote as advertize, however all I received was the game Wii play. I am disappointed to say the least. I think that Amazon.com needs to investigate some of these companies that advertize one thing but send you another. This was definitely a case of false advertizement. signed disappointed."
1,Just buy the remote by itself,"These games are really just tutorials on using the controllers. That's not worth $10 to me, since the controllers are fairly intuitive anyway."
3,The extra $10 is almost worth it,"Since I had already decided to get three additional Wiimotes, which would set me back $120, I figured one of them might as well be this bundle, as the extra $10 was less than 10% of my total expense. I don't regret it, but I could certainly live without these mini-games. I have played all of them and really never play them unless we have guests over. The cow racing, fishing, duck hunting and tank games are probably the best IMHO. It's too bad that only one of them can be played with four players."
4,wii mote with games,"This was definite a good buy. I had read the review on Amazon first before I bought it. Just the wI mote alone costs so you get the games for $10 which is really cheap. The games were quite fun - not as sophisticate as other games so that is why I gave it a 4 stars, could have been a 4.5 stars. I highly recommend if you are looking for a second wiimote."
3,My opionion to Wii Play,This is a nice set of games for a kids in the range of 4-9 I would say. I mean we played all of them and a enjoyed them but there not as chanllangeing as we thought they would be. Don't get me wrong they are fun and it was a nice way to get a bounch of games and a remote at a good price but I would recommend this for a younger kids.
1,Buy it for the remote only,"I was looking to buy an extra remote for my wii and decided on buying this game as it comes with a controller as for almost the same price of a controller i was also getting a game. In the end when i played these games, they are trivial and unexciting. No one in my house enjoyed playing the games within this game and this game has never been played since the first day we played it.So my advice, buy it for the remote only as it cant hurt to have extra games, who knows some kids may like them :)"
1,Save your money for a Nunchuk,"this is the sort of game that should come free with the Wii (built onto the wii sports disk) to use before you play Wii Sports. They are very simple games and the feel more like a bunch of proof of concepts for how to use the wii mote. On a side note, I would have loved this game is was real nes style duck huntthe bottom line is save your money to get a nunchuk which you will need and use more then this game after playing it once."
3,Games are ok,"Games were secondary to buying the remote. But...WiiPlay games are a bit hokey, although we do have fun with them."
2,The Wii remote doesn't work,"I couldn't get the Wii remote to work. Since that is the principal component of this set, that makes the set fairly worthless."
3,Can buy for the Wii Remote and nothing else!,"Bought this just for one reason - Wii Remote. Remote alone costs 39.99 and this item is 44.99 in amazon. So, $5 for the game (Wii play CD). The game is not good. May be for kids. For adults, it dont make no sense to buy. I would have rather bought Wii Remote + Motionplus bundle for the same price because Wii play (the CD that comes in this bundle) is sitting in the shelf from day 2 since I bought! So, people who need a Wii remote, please do yourself a favor and buy the Black Wii remote with Motion plus bundle (Motion plus sells $18 by itself) instead of buying Wii remote with Wii play bundle. Both these bundles cost the same in amazon. With Motionplus, u can play tennis, golf and other games with more realism and more fun..."
1,Very little value beyond the remote.,"""Free"" remote, but worthless game. Got very little play in my household. I tried, but no. I would even rank the original Wii Sports higher. Certainly nowadays there are better Wii games to choose from."
2,Only For Super Beginners,"The game is truly not a ""game"" at all.. it's like an electric version of an instruction manual for the remote control. It's really not very fun for very long. It's amusing for about 15 minutes, maybe 20, and then it's just... not. I ended up selling the game and keeping the remote. It's only really meant for beginners who can't figure out how to use the remote, in my opinion. It IS helpful in learning more about the remote, I agree, but I ended up getting this game days after I first started playing Wii, so it was a bit pointless."
4,Great for younger players,"If you are over 8yo and have any video game experience this game will be just too easy for you, but I have twin 4yo who are still learning how to control the wii remote and this package of mini games has helped quite a bit. As for an adult I would not consider it a game but more of a tutorial for anyone new to the Wii. It came with the controller which is what I was purchasing anyway for an additional $10 more, for us it was a good buy."
4,Wii Sport is more fun,"I like the games that it comes with for the price. BUT, I think that Wii Sport's games are more fun."
4,A fun way to get an extra Wii controller,"The games are entertaining and they do help you practice using the controller with the Wii. The tank game is a little complicated but the target (Duck Hunting) game is neat. But the Wii take full advantage of using the controller on its side in the riding game. It has hurdles and targets you have to either miss or collect. In order to go faster you have to roll the controller forward while you hold it on its side. And since controllers are difficult to find in stores rigt now, you get the added bonus of the games."
2,Not as fun as the wii game that comes with the system,I thought it was going to be more fun but it was not. Great deal though.. A game and a remote!
3,Great purchase if you need a remote!,The game is alright but the included remote made it worth it (I basically got the game for free).
4,Fun game!,"I really like the Mii game on this. The other games are okay but I will never get bored of the Mii game. I guess if you buy this, don't expect too much from it, but at least the extra wii remote is worth the cost."
4,Must see cult classic,"Dark Star is one of those cult classics that simply must be watched. I can't believe that John Carpenter and his buddies made it while they were still in film school! In addition to being darkly funny, the movie brings up a number of surprisingly relevant topics. Two decades ago, I quoted extensively from it when I wrote my electrical engineering master's thesis (on self-test in replicating systems), and last month I showed a clip of it for a presentation on philospher Nick Bostrom's ideas on simulation and reality at the gaming convention GenCon 2005."
1,"If I could bottle this cure for insomnia, I'd be rich...","After reading the reviews, I thought I'd give this one a try. I shouldn't have. What I should have done was paid more attention to the reviews that stated that this film isn't for everyone. I would have saved myself some money.It looks like a low-budget (which I guess it is), amateurish film -- along the lines of the Blair Witch Project, which I didn't care for either. But heck, I liked that better than this. And yes, I realize they're two totally different genres.It's like watching a home made movie that maybe your uncle made while following someone around with his camcorder.I will admit that a few scenes made me smile simply because they made me think of the fun the actors and directors must have had making such a campy film. But with that said, I expected more than what I got so I didn't care for it. Heck, I didn't even finish it. But to its credit, it solved my insomnia at least for one night."
4,Well worth your time,"Dark Star is a very clever and funny film. The special effects are incredible considering the miniscule budget that the makers of this Sci-Fi fantasy had to work with. It makes bad, big budget disasters like ""Supernova"" look even worse by comparison."
1,What were they smoking?,"My God, this movie must be the most boring thing I've seen since My Dinner with Andre. I wanted to like it...I tried to like it...but I guess I'm just one of the ones who ""didn't get it"". I'm not certain that's such a bad thing. I understood the premise and the plot, but I didn't crack a smile during the entire film, and I spent half the time looking at my watch in disbelief at how slow time can seem to pass. One word: monotonous! I now use my Dark Star DVD as an ""avant garde"" coaster for my coffee mug at work. R.I.P."
3,dark star,"A classic. I loved the talking bomb and the beach ball alien. I also notice that George Lucas ripped off the hyperdrive effect he uses in Star Wars from this movie.Very silly, but I liked it anyway."
2,I guess not bad for a first movie,"I didn't realize until after I read it that this movie was made with such a low budget, and by beginners, or else I might have liked it a little. Not knowing that, I compared it to movies like Soylent Green, Logan's Run, etc., and was almost offended by the shabbiness of the sets, acting, and fairly pointless story. I'm sure some people would be impressed with the humor(?), or the story(?), but I mostly thought it was worthwhile to watch it as an artifact in the history of sci-fi film. In this way, it's worthwhile, I think."
1,Constant Nightmare,"Though is seems other have had mixed results with this unit, mine have been nothing but trouble. I have never had a piece of equipment give me so much trouble. Very spotty.I don't recomend it."
1,Keep Looking if you're considering this product,"This all-in-one printer/scan/fax etc.. was great in the beginning. However, just after the 90 day warranty expired, the print quality began to fall, especially with the black ink. The customer service people only tell you what you can read in the manual and their service center for D/FW is over 20 miles away. The print head has failed, costing 150.00 plus labor. So...here I am searching for a new machine. Buyer Beware!"
3,not all its cracked up to be,"I know Kay Ryan is the next big thing in poetry, but I found her poetry to be lacking in substance. Her style I loved. I found it to be fresh and invigorating, it is more that the poems didn't seem to contain anything within them. Oh there were a few gems here and there (I especially liked ""Wooden""), but not for the length of the collection."
5,my bulldog can't even tear through these,"our dog's only mission for toys is mission destroy. these are great, they stand up to the test and can last for months (which trust me is a long time in our house). he likes the liver flavor best, chews them much more than the chicken ones. the vendor shipped promptly and we received in two days (we're amazon prime)."
1,Terrible,"Just awful-so boring. All of the stories seem to blend together. ""White man is evil"" is the common theme."
4,Against the Grain,Although some of the other reviewers blast this book I for one think it was most informative if for no other reason it gives the novice all basic information pertaining to each year presented. If you are at the point in your hobby that you are actually investing in cars then this book is not for you because undoubtedly you have all this information memorized! Another reason for favorable review is that I actually own the 55 Buick Century Convertible featured in this book!
4,A word in praise of Langworths,"I do not own, nor have I read this book. Nor do I know anything whatsoever about Buicks, or the procurement thereof. From the picture on the cover, and the fact that the title has the word ""car"" in it, I assume that a Buick is some kind of automobile.However, I do know Mr. Langworth's son. The young master Langworth is a stand-up fellow, and, with proper care and feeding, will without a doubt grow into an exemplary specimen of the human species. I highly recommend that you buy this book. Due to my total lack of authority to comment on the content of the book itself, I offer that you make your purchase for no other reason than that doing so will help put little Ian through school."
4,Game Design Complete...............allmost.,"I truly enjoyed this book! Patrick O'Luanaigh gives you a complete lesson on the ""School of Hard Knocks"" game design. This book goes through all the considerations a designer must take into account while completing a project and it does the job pragmatically. I was somewhat disappointed by the title, thinking it was going to be a book about every aspect of creating a game including game engines, modeling programs and so forth, but it was a happy disappointment of sorts. This author doesn't tell you the technical aspects of creating a game, he tells you the practical aspects! This book is definitely not an ""all-in-one"" manual, but an invaluable designer companion!"
1,This doesn't work,"I have run 8 batteries through the charging cycle and none of them came out any better than they started. While it does get the battery voltage back up to 1.5 volts as measured with a volt meter and no load on the battery, testing them with my ZTS MBT-1 battery tester that tests them under load resulted in the batteries being no better than before charging."
1,Big Price for 4 recharged batteries,This unit worked as stated for the first 4 batteries I put in it. After that even new rechargeable batteries will not charge.
2,Lacklustre,"This is one of the poorer examples of the long running series with some less than adequate production values .Holmes and Watson are assigned the task of escorting an imperilled prince ,sympathetic to the British cause ,back to his native land .The journey is being made by ocean liner and the bad guys are on hand to seek to kill not only the young ruler but the great man himselfCue attempts on their lives by amongst others knife throwing midgets and senior German agents .Rathbone is marginally under his best as if slighly contemptuous of the material and the shabby production but it does have an admirable economy that makes it just about passable if not representative of the series at its best"
5,Chris Issak Video,"Sent it as a gift to my Aunt. She was thrilled and has enjoyed it so much. Very, very happy."
3,disturbing,"This book was like a traffic accident. It was horrific and disturbing but I couldnt put it down. Don't be mislead by the pretty front cover with a mamoth on it, this book is full is graphic violence,torture and sorrow. I would not recommend it for children at all, even though the cover makes it look like a happy little book.I almost wish I had not read it..... Poor baby mamoths..."
1,Contains moth eggs.,"After using half a bottle of Salad Toppins, and storing the bottle with the lid sealed tightly in my pantry for a month, I opened the bottle up again to find a live moth with a bunch of cobweb-type material. Needless to say I tossed the bottle and I don't think I'll be buying Salad Toppins again for a while. It's a shame because I liked them up until that happened."
2,Small and Dry,I ordered these because it seemed like a good buy. I received them fine but I was not happy. They are very small seeds. They are over roasted to the point of being so dry that there is only a crunchy dry tastless seed inside.I had several other people try them and they thought the same thing. I am stuck with all of them because they are not returnable. So if you want to try them do not order very many at first.
1,Bogus Reproduction,"I bought this in the expectation that it was a reproduction of an essay by Henry Wilberforce Clarke. It's clearly written by someone else (the author notes at one point that he/she is ""indebted to H. Wilberforce Clarke's notes,"" or something to that effect, and there's no way Clarke would have thanked himself, would he? This is a very slender volume that has little of interest to anyone studying Sufism and mysticism, and is misattributed to an author whose work is now occasionally coming back into print."
1,"Some good info, but poorly researched","I have to agree with the other reviewer that Rolle has not seemed to really have studied the topic well. This is a good source of information for those interested in the ancient horse-archer cultures but please don't take it as the final word. Tamara Talbot Rice's book from the 50s on the Scythians is a much better account, if you can track it down."
2,"overly belabored writing, predictable characters/development","That just about sums it up. I'd rather read other equally (if not more) verbose writers such as Tad Williams and Stephen R. Donaldson. After half of ""Curse of the Mistwraith,"" I started skimming to get the gist of the action rather than be bogged down by the language. I find the word ""inveigle"" especially annoying now, after so many uses of it -- spoken by the characters, no less!Usually I follow the good fantasy/sci-fi series (like her collaborations with Feist) to the bitter end, but this one just has not been worth the time or money -- if you really want to check it out, get it from your library instead, if you can find it. We all know what's going to happen in the end, and I find myself not caring how it gets there in the next 5 or 6 books that the author promises."
2,Hodgson Mill Couscous,"I was disappointed in this product. I much prefer the taste of Near East couscous, however it wasn't offered on amazon when I placed my order."
4,Hits aphids where they live,"Since aphids hang out under plant leaves they can be hard to treat with a spray. The head on this sprayer can be turned to spray a fine mist upward. Sweet!I used it to apply neem oil (per directions!) to my chili plants. It took several applications, but I think I finally rid my little chili buddies from that obnoxious little parasite.I am hopeful that this spring they will once again produce some smoking hot Thai chilis."
4,Read description carefully,"This toy comes with only one of the characters shown on the box--Spiderman--and it's difficult to get the other characters because the company that makes them is no longer in business. The toy is also difficult to assemble, but once it's together, it's great fun."
4,Snatch them up...,"For $19.99 (I got mine at TRU today for that price in store), this is a bargain. This is actually a perfect compliment to the DC Super Friends figures that are starting to hit the stores, the figures are basically the same size. My son will be so psyched to have Batman, Superman and Spiderman to all play together in ""Spidey's house""! Also, there are new Spiderman figures out (Kohls had them), and they will probably work with this as well."
3,rip off,The spiderman included was discolored. The item was difficult to put together. I found the item much cheaper at Toys R us than online at amazon.
1,The Glasses Have Defects,"We ordered eight of these glasses. Seven of them had small bubbles, chipped glass, and other small-sized defects in the bowl area. Most of the defects are noticeable at a distance, and more defects are seen upon close inspection.When asked if the defective glasses could be replaced, we were told that others in-stock had similar issues.The glasses would get 5 Stars without the defects. They have a nice size, shape, and weight.The order arrived very well packaged from myTableware. Their customer service was top-notch with quick responses. A refund and return shipping label were issued without hesitation."
5,I still love this book!,"I was so happy to find that this book is back in print. I loved it as a kid, and I'm glad to have it for my kids now. I was surprised to find that some new illustrations and a little bit of new text had been added, but it didn't detract from the original. All the original pictures and text are still there."
5,wonderful story from my childhood,"This is a wonderful little story about a girl who loves dolls. I was once such a girl, and my mother read this story to me over and over in The 50's. I sent this book to my little grand daughter so that she will be able to enjoy it as well.The dollmaker makes the little girl (who shows quite a bit of independence and initiative, perhaps beyond what is completely realistic) a seventh doll to complete her collection of dolls her father has brought her from his travels around the world. The seventh doll is truly a product of multi-culturism, and looks just like the little girl herself! You will have to read it. It is charming!"
5,awesome,Drink this every night. Love it. Helps me with my stomach symptoms and would recommend someone who has digestive problems to try out.
4,Great,"I bought the MK-2 Tripod a few months ago and within a few weeks, I lost the removable head piece (the part that screws into the camera). I decided to buy the MK-S because there's nothing to be removed [thus, nothing to lose] and because it's sturdier that the others. The legs are a little thicker and don't look like they'll snap like some of the other ones. The price is great and I really recommend it."
2,cheated of the original fun,I was a fan of Baywatch for most of the 11 seasons it was on TV so I was glad to hear it was coming out on DVD . I bought season 2 only to be dissappointed. Not only are the seasons or episodes not in sequence but that the original music has been replaced. The opening theme song has been changed to some slow boring song that does not match up with the action of the credits. Season 2 episodes of this DVD are actually season 3 and then you get 2 episodes of the 1989 original which should be in the season 1 DVD. I won't be wasting any more of my money until this problem is corrected and the show is put back to it's orginal form.
1,Disappointing,Disappointed in what is said to be season 2 is really season 3 and is missing the beginning of the first 3 episodes.
3,Seeing is believing...,"The story reads very much like J.D. Salinger's Catcher in theRye, except that JD's was a work of fiction and Vilar's is a true andheart wrenching account of her own experience. From a literaryperspective, it is obvious that Vilar is young. But this work holds the promise of greater literary works by Vilar. Vilar's talent is in her ability to drag you in to her story and aid you in understanding it without too much of a fuss. The books makes great reading for HS students. It is valuable in terms of it's linkage to contemporary historical facts about which HS students may just be learning. The books biggest benefit is in its telling in the intimate way only an insider can about the aftermath of political actions of the 1950's."
2,Meh.,"I had been completely taken by this series, but it just kind of lost momentum for me. I think Simon got bored with it himself and has been mailing it in for a while now."
5,"getting ""it""","one word - wow. i've heard about est and about landmark forum from a friend of mine and i happened to run across ""the book of est"" at a used book store. i paid extraordinarily less than it is offered online, but the used prices are probably still less than the course itself, which i'm sure is totally worth taking. although i haven't ""experienced"" the landmark forum course, i did get ""it' from experiencing the earlier form of the course (est) vicariously through this great book. i had the amazing epiphany on new year's eve and felt absolutely empowered and free. what a way to start the new year. i highly recommend this title. it's quite an experience."
3,An OK album; but nothing special.,"I was visiting some friends a couple a weeks ago. There was some very music playing in the background; and when I asked them about it, I was informed I was listening to a CD by Phil Coulter. Since we were close to the holiday season, I decided to take a chance on his Christmas effort. After giving it a listen; I would put it in the category of ""pleasant, but not great."" I say this as someone who already owns a couple of dozen Christmas CD's. For someone new to this area of music, they might enjoy this particular production. As for myself, I would have passed on this disc if I could have listened to it beforehand."
4,A very good film.,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.This film had been said to be a very accurate adaptation of Charles Dickens' Novel. Having not read it, I cannot give an opinion on this.The acting is very good and the movie is very well photographed. Alec Guinnes (best known for Obi Wan in Star Wars) is also in this film. This film is well written and the scenery for Mrs. Havisham's house is also very nice.There is only a theactrical trailer for a special feature but it still is a good release."
3,Great Expectations - Criterion Collection,"I usually love Criterion editions and am willing to pay the increased price to receive all the usual Criterion extras - commentary, interviews, etc.Unfortunately, aside from the normal remastered print of the film (very well done indeed), the trailer and the inside notes, this edition had none of the features I have come to expect (and pay dear for). Therefore, I would not recommend this item (at its current high price) to anyone who already owns a good print of the movie.JBF"
4,Great Collection,"A great collection that is very affordable. The only isssue is that the formatting makes Ulysses a little difficult to read. Already a tough read, there are no breaks between episodes."
1,"Music OK, DVD is insane, video quality awful.","First, the menuing and navigation system is the stupidest and most counterproductive I have seen on a DVD. Normally if I don't like the menus I just use chapter / track search, but that is disabled when playing this DVD.I don't understand why they bothered to include a DTS track unless it was so they could put a ""DTS"" sticker on the label and fool everyone into thinking this is a well-mastered DVD. It is not. Also the ""Audio"" track selection is disabled, so you have to search around the menus to eventually find ""vector control"" to set the audio.Video quality is very bad. Lighting was apparently a problem, camera lenses were dirty and there was excessive glare."
2,A poorly laid out rule book,"If you play Warhammer 40k you'll almost certainly need this book since Marines are the flagship army of that game. Unfortunately this book is very hard to use.GW chose to put the rules and background for units and some weapons in one section, the rules for some weapons and equipment in another and then the point cost and statistics in a third.So to learn what your Marine Scouts do you have to flip among three different sections.The book of course does not have an index.The other aspects are also disappointing. Most of the art is reused from other rulebooks, some of it is 15 years old. The models are standard models with decent paint jobs but nothing extraordinary. There are none of the great dioramas or conversions from older 40k rule books.It's a shame GW didn't make this book easier to use or more interesting to read."
3,An instructive guide,"Published in 2001, Bird Life contains 160 pages. Stephen W. Kress, Ph.D., is the author. The numerous color illustrations are by John D. Dawson. In addition to the topics covered, there is an index. This guide is a primer on bird biology and behavior. It is intended for those that are not just interested in the identification of birds. It is not only educational but concise. I am impressed with the quality of the illustrations--the artist is talented. Examples of topics discussed are habituation, preening, bathing, anting, sleeping, feeding behaviors, peck orders, mobbing, territories, mate recognition, nest helpers, vocalizations, hearing, flight, navigation and migration, longevity, and attracting birds. This guide is informative and recommendable."
2,Just... Weak.,"Lacks conviction; they obviously had an idea of what they wanted this to sound like, and it proved overly ambitious, because this CD is incredibly generic. I am entirely confused by the other reviewers who proclaim it is a moving experience; it just flat [is bad]."
3,Not As Good As the Others,"I didn't like this Stinky Face book as much as the first two. This book strays a bit from the format of the first ones, so you don't have to turn the page to get the mother's response. It seems more forced to me.My son (4.5) made me read I Love You Stinky Face about a hundred times when we first got it. We've read this one exactly once."
4,"Great, but not perfect","What a wonderful and fun DVD! The images are fascinating, the narration is delightful and informative, but there is one annoying problem. Many times throughout they make reference to the 50 second length of all the films, but, unfortunately, on this recording they only last 40 seconds BECAUSE THEY WERE RECORDED AT THE WRONG SPEED! The Chapter numbers also don't match up with the table of contents. But over all, this is a very worthwhile and enjoyable DVD."
2,The Bubble Reputation,"This is the second time I've read this book and I liked it even less on the second reading. I'm a big fan of books with quirky characters, even though there were quirky characters in this book, I didn't find them believable or likable.The suicide story line did not ring true either, not enough emotion or explanation.I would pass on this one."
5,where is the DVD version?,"This is the best presented documentary by Graham Hancock, it contains 3 different parts and is full of adventure. Hancock is a real life Indiana Jones..his 10-500bc theory is mind blowing and presented so clear. Robert Bauval, Robert Schoch, and Zahi Hawass make appearances. Only problem is that it is only available on VHS..can anyone tell me where to get this title on DVD?"
3,Unintentionally controversial?,"This is a fun read-aloud. However, I sometimes get embarrassed reading it when Edwina realizes that her only real job is to be a mother. What kind of message is that?"
5,A WINNER!,"I'm always searching for fun books to read to my 3yr old granddaughter and Edwina was a big hit! The rhyming verse is a breeze to read aloud, repetitive phrases make it easy for her to join in, and the illustrations are fabulous! I would also recommend Edward the Emu, which I purchased first. Edwina is the sequel."
2,use free ebay instead of buying this book,"If I had not gone on ebays free and comprehensive and easy to understand audio and written sites, I would have thought this was good, even though rather terse. Ebay is a better way to go for free and is MUCH more detailed and MUCH more comprehensive."
2,Interesting but ultimately annoying,"This was engaging enough, and the writing was competent, but I got extremely tired of reading about a heroine who was such a bad judge of character! Her self-centeredness combined with an unerring instinct to make the wrong choice each time she was presented with one made her a very unlikable character."
3,"And Only to Deceive (Lady Emily Mysteries, Book 1)","I give this book three stars. It was okay, but not really the type of histroical fiction I enjoy. The mystery was fairly predictable after the first couple of chapters. The historical facts were very accurate, but the storyline was not really believable for the time period. I probably will not spend time reading any more of this series."
5,An entertaining read for late night,I like the historical setting with a good mystery with a few twists and turns. A non-violent mystery but still with action.
5,A MARVELOUS book!!!!!!!!!!,"Ms. Alexander's And Only to Deceive is the best read I've had in ages! Why didn't I know about it when it came out? A friend told me about it and I thought she must have been exaggerating about how good it was. But it's lived up to her praise, and more. I'm giving it as a Christmas gift to several people because I want them to have a delightful holiday. You don't need to be snow-bound to keep reading this marvelous book!!!"
2,Wanted to like it,"I hate when I have high expecations of a book and get disappointed. It dragged, it was transparent and frankly...boring. I read it to the end even though I pretty much knew from the start who was the evil doer and that drives me nuts. More romance than suspense."
3,cute little thing,This was a cute little book so I sent it to my 12 year old nieces. They absolutely adored it.
5,Quiet as expressed in words,This book describes silence in gorgeous prose and poetry. I recommend it to anyone who loves the sound and feel of the written word and the sound and feel of quiet.
2,Too Small,This is just too small for the average American lunch containers--too narrow. More like a very small kid's lunchbox. Not for adults.
3,Cute Bag,"Although I find this bag to be a cute way to carry my lunch it is not as big as I thought it was. The description states that you can carry alot of things in this bag, but I don't find that to be true. Overall I am satisfied with style."
5,very attractive.,"I love the looks of this new bag. My husband even thought it was a new pocket book. Plenty of room for everything. My only complaint would be, I wish it were taller/deeper. I use aluminum water bottles and they are to tall to stand upright. I can not say how long food stays cold, I just place the bag into the refrigerator when I get to work."
1,Intentional misinformation?,"This is a nice, attractive bag. However, the manufacturer lists the dimensions as 12"" x 6.5"" x 8.5"". However, once I received it, I took out a ruler and measured it. According to my ruler (a standard, U.S. 12""), the bag is 9"" x 4.5"" x 7"". This is significantly smaller than advertised. Why would they not list the actual dimensions? Many food containers are smaller than the bag that I received, so, despite the attractive design, it is not all that useful."
1,Broken zipper,"I have had other Sachi lunch bags so I was excited to get this one. When I got it I really liked as it seemed to be the perfect size. However, the zipper was broken so I returned it."
5,"Durable and Beautiful, who could ask for more?!","I got this lunch bag for my 11 year old daughter. She LOVES IT. Not only is it beautiful, and looks just like a really cool purse, the thermal lining keeps her lunch cold or hot. It is very durable and easy to clean."
4,"Love the bag, hate the price","I LOVE this bag for carrying my lunch every day. It is a little big, but I tend to bring a lot of food to last me throughout the day, so it is necessary to have a larger bag. The look of the bag is very nice. It looks like I'm carrying two purses when I arrive at my office. :)The only thing I don't like so much is the price, but that's probably just because I'm extremely frugal.. Ok.. Cheap. :)"
2,Works ok-- too big to use for daily lunch,"It's a decent enough bag-- works as advertised more or less. Put it in the refrigerator for a few minutes to get it cold and it will keep your lunch moderately cold. The only real downsize is that it's very large-- far too big to simply bring your lunch into work every day. It's more for bringing a week's worth of lunches into work. I'm sure that works for some folks, but it wasn't for my wife, so we sent it back."
2,"Way too big, not enough insulation","This bag is really cute from the outside and is pretty stable. The problem is that it is much too big - the size of 2.5 lunches and it has really thin insulation. I should have sent it back right away. I tried to like it, but after a month, I still don't and will look for a new lunch bag."
3,fascinating..,"Anyone who has been to Alaska would appreciate the amazing scenery, especially the shots from very remote areas that most visitors wouldn't access. the video quality is a bit rough, but understandable considering the circumstances. i do recommend this to anyone who has thoughts of hunting in AK."
2,I really wanted to like it...,"The previous reviews had me believe that this movie would be full of great scenery (no real hunting) and great photography of Alaska. The photography is only slightly better then a home movie. A lot of out of focus shots, and he shakes a lot too. A tripod would of helped! I would not buy this movie if I had the opportunity to view it first. I wanted to like it .... but it was not well filmed."
3,more physiology than anatomy,This book was so lacking in useful anatomy images that I threw it away. The price was enticing but ultimately it wasn't useful as an anatomy guide.
5,Fashionable Belt with Style,This belt is great to wear with jeans or cords and has a cute design on it. Fits perfect with pants that have large belt loops where you need a wider belt. Very good construction and quality of leather. Would highly recommend the belt.
2,not worth the price,"I bought this Hummer RC truck as well as the Chevy Silverado model. This RC truck is highly over priced. At best, this product might be worth $20! The motor is very weak -does not have a lot of power, especially when the battery is low. The battery requires 4 hours of charge - after two initial 8 hour charges - and only provides ~15 minutes of run time. Turning ability is also extremely weak - again, especially when the battery is weak. I would not recommend this product at all."
2,At least some parts were interesting,"This book was somewhat unfocused and weak especially in discussion of Japanese/European interactions. There were three general areas covered. The actual 1940's submarine missions described and recovery efforts in the 1990's were interesting and seemed well thought out. The author fleshed out the book with suppositions, attention to somewhat irrelevant details and general information about Japanese interests (embassies, spies, etc.) in Europe as WWII was winding down. The writing in this last area lowered my interest in the book to where it was hard to finish."
3,"Georgette Heyer, always good","this is a young Heyer book, written in the form of the period, and as such does not have the depth and challange of the usual Heyer books. Helen is a book that shows a girl's growth in the period before and after the First World War, and as such gives a glimpse of a simpler time, one whose outlook was always hopeful, which the war changed. The book is shallower than I liked, but still gives an insight into a time none of us born in WW2 could ever hope to know."
5,The best shark book I ever bought,"All I can say is ""wow."" I've spent most of my weekends looking for the best shark books, and I've found it. This book is not only a definitive book for basic biology of the sharks, but also has bios on individual species and an entire section about how to dive with sharks safely."
2,Great for filling those small gap spaces in your library.,"As a reference to research the communist block nations' weapon of choice, I advice to look at other publications. This needs more picts instead of leaving it to readers to use their imagination on what a particular model of AK must look like if author simply says ""...similar in appearance to..."" However, the history of how it was developed was well covered."
3,NICE BUT....,"I got this watch about 10 years ago. I wear it a few times a month. It does stil work and looks okay. However, this is way too much for a watch with a mineral crystal. My crystal has scratched. The stainless holds up about avaerage and mechanically I can't complaint because it still works. It does need regular refurbishing by a jeweler to look perfect but that is to be expected. But the crystal should be a deal breaker. Unless you are EXTREMELY careful with your watches, this is going to scratch. No $400+ watch should have a cheap crystal on it."
4,good system,"It's a good system for the money. It can be confusing to set up add on's, but it works great. Motion censer is not recommended in houses with pets."
4,Skylink SC-100,"Product works as advertised. Easy to install and setup. I brought this for my mother-in-law who is 75 years old, living alone in an apartment. Her apartment was broken into recently. The police officer who responded indicated that door hardware is good but the best deterrent was an alarm system and signs posted on the windows and doors. He suggested Radio Shack and several others but after reviewing the web, i decided to try the skylink system. It was really easy to setup and install. I setup and tested the system at my home first. Took us about 1 hour to get everything working. We brought the SC-100 system along with an extra keypad. Went over to my mother-in-law's apartment and installed one door alarm, two keypad and motion detector. It took me 3 hours from start to finish. She uses the remote to set the alarm and so far so good."
4,Very good & simple system,"6 months now from installation (simple by the way), no problems to report. Only one false allarm in 6 months.Only three wishes: little more range for the remote control, more power to siren, and better documentation (even if the whole set works very well).With no much more other systems to choose from Amazon, I think it is a good deal."
5,Skylink SC-100,A very inexpensive and manageable system. I bought two and they are working well. Alarm is very loud. Keypad is easy to operate and instructions are easy to understand. Prompt shipping. Very satisfied.
3,Faulty Control Panel,"I rated this product a 3 because the first system installed had a faulty control panel. Initial testing was good, but after mounting, every time I attempted to put it in Chime Mode (or any mode except Off), the alarm went off. After talking with Skylink support, they determined that the Control Panel/cover was faulty and the Control Panel needed to be replaced. The second system received has worked fine.One item lacking from this system is a ""ready"" status. In other words, before setting the system to one of the alarm settings, you have no way of telling if all doors or windows are closed. For example, if you have a sensored window open when you set the alarm system on, there is no notification beep or light - the open window zone is just not included in the ""alarm on"" system. It is as if that window was never part of the system. To me this is not a major problem - just check all windows/doors before setting the alarm."
2,simply BAD BAD,PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS THIS NOT HAVE ANY PROFESSIONAL OR EDUCATIONAL USE AT ALL IS A BAD VERY BAD CAD DETAILS.
2,Bi-fold NOT,"This is actually two separate ramps. ""It"" does not fold. ""They"" are not joined together. They are well-made and quite solid; however, they are not hinged or joined in any way."
4,As Always Better and Different Than the Movie,"I watched ""the Ninth Gate"" with some friends last summer. They were only interested in the surface of the plot but I was more interested in the esoteric part of the movie. When I first went to school my English teacher told me that a book, ""The Club Dumas"" was based on. I imeadiatly went out to buy the book and when I read it I was glad that I did.There are a few different plots that are going on at the same time, and you are constantly confised so you want to read on to figure out what is going on. He does a great job explaining everything at the end of the book and you feel smart because you figured th book out. T do have to say that the confusion iss the books downfall too.The point of view changes two ar three times a chapter along with the scene making it hard to follow at times. After you have read the chapter a few chapters later you figure out what is going on and how it relates.A great mystery that follows the tradition and breaks the rules."
4,And before Dan Brown and Da Vinci Code...,"...there was Arturo Perez Reverte. This is my fave Reverte book along with The Flanders Panel, and it is very similar.Few guys are in pursuit of medieval magic grimoire that has illustrations signed by...Lucifer himself! Yeah, it sounds cheap, but it has comic ending, believe it or not, and it is more kinda farce than esotheric thriler.GET/BORROW THIS ONE, it is FUN!"
2,Dvd Issues,I wonder if the manufacturer has changed. Neither the original nor the replacement played in my computer and I had freezing in my dvd player. A bad batch?
1,This movie sucks.,"Don't even bother. Not even the lesbian scenes can make this movie worth watching. Not quite horror. Not quite mystery. Very stupid, not put together well. The ending was just horrible. The Redemption intro was almost worth the money though. I think i'm in love."
3,Lukewarm Lullaby,"I enjoy this CD, but only the first 3 songs on it. The others are pretty, but I just like the first 3 best. I do support the cause tho, which was one of the main reasons I bought the CD."
2,Not quite as advertized,"Best I can tell these are just pressed wood..not a high quality material. Also, if you look at the photo, you'll see 'pin legs' to isolate the speaker/stand from the desk or table. Those were not included although the holes for them are there. They did send some rubber feet..adhesive but will peal off. The edges of almost every component have been damaged or discolored.One of the legs of each unit has a channel for the speaker wire. That maybe would be okay if you were driving regular speakers. But if you're using powered speakers you're out of luck. The hole in the bottom plate is too small to put an xlr or even an rca connector through and of course you couldn't thread it through the channel anyway since they are wire stapled.They work and I'll keep and use them but don't expect much for quality or accuracy. They say made in the USA. But I wonder."
3,Product has Changed,"According the manufacturer's website, this desk lamp uses a standard 22W T9 circular fluorescent, but that information is out of date. It now uses a thinner, more modern 25W T5 bulb and an electronic instant start ballast instead of the traditional ""push to start"" pre-heat ballast. The 25W T5 is not nearly as common as the old 22W T9s. If you want the classic look and feel of the older fluorescent bulb and readily available replacement bulbs, you'll want to look elsewhere."
5,Great Music,"I first heard this when it was new. I was afraid to play my old cassette, fearing it would break. What a great CD! Fantastic energy! The sounds are so different. This is a FUN piece of music!"
3,"Extremely Small, Tight Fit For Whisker's","I had seen the reviews on here previously that expressed some concern over the size of this case. However I checked on Oakley's official website and this was the recommended size case for my Oakley Whisker Polarized glasses. So undaunted I purchased them here on Amazon.Let me start by saying that they do fit, but the fit is incredibly tight, in fact so tight that I have gotten my Whisker's stuck in there once and decided never to use the case again.The case itself is well made, but I'd much rather not risk getting my ~$200 Prescriptions stuck in there or damaged in the case. Another downside is that it does not fit my 31Thirteen's either that I use for my daily prescription.If I could do it over again I would have ordered the Medium Sized Soft Vault (my order from my Optometrist apparently included the Medium Soft Vault with my Whiskers) which fit the Whiskers and my 31Thirteen's quite well (although they do have room to roll)."
4,Sunglasses case,"The quality of the case is very good, it closes with a zipper that protect the glasses. The large size is too large for thin Oakley sunglasses models as the Whisker."
5,light and delicious,This tea is my new alternative after Jasmine green tea.It is so smooth and light. Ican drink it anytime.
4,great chopping attachment,Very powerful immersion blender. The chopping attachment is great and does not take up alot of room. Great purchase and price.
1,Do not purchase,"I've always trusted Cuisinart for superior products. This is the worst stick blender I've ever purchased. The locking mechanism broke the second time i used it. It is poorly designed and difficult to switch from the blender part to the chopper, as the button used to unlock the parts is small and difficult to push in."
3,Some Flaws,"I just got this yesterday so can't say anything about stripping gears but I do have a few complaints. The lid to the chopper attachment doesn't really go on or come off that easily. Not a huge deal, but it's cumbersome. More so what bothers me is that the chopper container has 4 or 5 vertical ""ridges"" on the inside. One, that means you can't scrape out the contents from the sides with a spatula because it gets stuck on the ridges. Two, if you make something liquid or something like nut butter, those ridges, or the grooves around those ridges, are going to be hard to clean. I am actually thinking about returning it for that reason. It really bugs me.The whisk seemed powerful and I do like that it has two speeds. The instructions say not to fill the chopper bowl more than 3/4 of the way. Of course I read this after I cut up an onion into it to chop it and filled it all the way. The end result was that the onion on the bottom was almost pureed and on top there were still big chunks."
2,"Yes, it's a piece of crap.","It works pretty well until it breaks, then it doesn't. And the number of uses until the aforementioned cheap plastic gears strip does not justify the purchase."
3,Stick Mixer,It's alright...I cannot seem to get it to make a chunky smoothy...it seems to really blend the ice and fruit to liquid
1,stripped gear,"Like other reviewer, I also experienced stripped plastic gear which in my opinion is a design flaw. The gear should have been metal but then it will not fail as quickly .........less sales for the company. It is designed to fail. Will not buy a cuisinart again."
3,Different color than pictured...,"The bolts were not the color as in the picture...they arrived with yellow and orange, instead of the cooler black and green pictured. Buyer beware!"
3,vantage point bksp-white speaker mount,"These are a good product, but they did not fit my application for wall mounting speakers."
2,pen making,Nice pictures but not much information on the subject or details of the things needed to get to get the job started.
4,Enjoyed this book very much!,Great book for people that you want to know about fibromyalgia. Little sections after each chapter for you to fill out about your symptoms.
4,Funny Movie,"Balls of Fury was pretty funny. It is your typical ""dumb-funny"" movie. There many exaggerations and some inappropriateness, but overall it's not too bad."
2,Looks Like More Fun to Make Than to Watch,"Christopher Walken and James Hong elevate the movie. Maggie Q and Aisha Tyler are hot and the film knew how to dress them.But I kept thinking: so even the scripts Jack Black turns down are still getting made?There are more laughs in the ""Fistful of Yen"" segment in 1977's KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE (a direct parody of ENTER THE DRAGON) than the entire length of this film."
3,There were a few scenes that were a hoot!,"Boy plays ping pong. Boy's father makes deal but loses his life when he loses match. Boy grows up to be a man, although a little overweight and a loser. Man meets Special Agent who tells him to go undercover (basically)and solve the mystery of who killed his father. Man meets a blind trainer with a beautiful daughter. Man trains. Man plays in tournament (to the death) against some really funny characters (especially the black guy from White Chicks...he is toooooo dog gone funny, especially when he does the robot)! Man solves the mystery, kills the bad guy and gets the girl. Viewer gets to laugh, a lot, out loud. So, like a Mastercard commercial...Bored, Sunday afternoon....rent Balls of Furry $3.99. A few good laughs, Priceless."
4,"Campy, cheesy, lame and ridiculously funny in parts...","While it's certainly not high cinema, it did have its share of gut-busting laughs... I liked a lot of the casting.I'll grant you, a lot of the humor was sophomoric, or crude, or offered deadpan (which was funny in its own right in a few instances), and there were some slow, boring and/or predicatble stretches. But on the whole I generally enjoyed it (since I knew about what to expect). If Amazon did half points, I'd give it 3.5 stars. I definitely liked it more thanBeerfest, which is rather similar but with drinking games instead of ping pong... I thought this one was carried off better and considerably funnier."
2,mildly amusing at best,"**1/2The humor is broad and predictably predictable in ""Balls of Fury,"" a low-grade, though admittedly good-natured, sports farce that elicits roughly one laugh for every five attempts at being funny (not a bad ratio as movie comedies go these days, but not really high enough to make the film worth seeing). The plot, which is barely worth detailing here, involves a has-been table tennis champion (Dan Fogler) hired by the F.B.I. to infiltrate a ping pong tournament (a literal ""death match"") being hosted by a notorious underworld kingpin (played to the hilt by the one and only Christopher Walken). George Lopez, James Hong, and Diedrich Bader (""The Drew Carey Show"") round out the likable cast.Despite a handful of laugh-out-loud moments and an air of genuine sweetness, there's no compelling reason to recommend ""Balls of Fury,"" aside from Walken`s campy performance. My advice, therefore, would be to skip ""Balls of Fury"" altogether and re-watch ""Airplane"" or ""Naked Gun"" instead."
4,Nice Bag,Great bag. Functional. Lots of places for stuff.Really liked the way it attaches to the stroller. (interchangable straps)Good diaper bag without being too feminine.
5,Awesome service!,"I purchased this book for a class I was scheduled to take. The cost of the book through this seller was far less than it would have been through the college. I bought a ""used"" book, but I can't tell at all that the book had ever even been opened. The book arrived within just a few days of my order, so I was very happy - with the service, and the condition of the book I bought! :-) The book is exactly as described, and handy enough to travel with."
5,Great headset for the price,My husband and I blow through these with internet businesses but the sound quality is really great.
2,Cheap junk - buy a bunch if you must,When I buy these I generally get them for $3 each and buy them five at a time. They last a few months and then die. The weakness is the connection of the wire to the headset. It is weak and eventually fails. But they work fine until they fail.
1,Not a good fit,It is difficult to hear with this headset. The earpiece doesn't fit well enough to push the speaker close enough. I end up holding the earpiece close to my ear so I can hear.
3,its nice for night time out.,I also purchased versace Bright chystal. which is my signature fragrance. and i love it the noir is nice just a little heavier.more for night use.
4,Good source of lovely stocking patterns,"I have this book and like it so much I sent this copy to my daughter who wants to make feltede Christmas ornaments for those who work for her. She has ones that I made for her from this book. Instead of copying the pattern, I gave her the whole book because there are many other good things in it."
1,clinican,I should have listened to the previous person who rated this book. It is terrible how can anyone say this is an examination book in prepartion for an advanced degree. Anyone who possess a msn does not need this book this book is very fundamental it is certainly not for advanced practice. I would only recommend this book to someone who is beginning nursing simply for the anatomy physiology sections. NOT GOOD at all. Terrible. I would like a money back guarantee.
5,great tea,"To my surprise, this tea has a lot of flavor and good flavor. The flavor is mostly of cinnamon."
5,Lie to Me Season One,This is just what I wanted. I am disappointed that Lie to Me was cancelled after the Third Season. It is one of my favorite shows.
4,"Nice interesting Package, but time to Move On?","I purchased this for my use, but passed it along to my retired Aunt who has started a Hand-Made Greeting Card Business, and is very Craft oriented. I think I have become too computer oriented, even though I have years of practical art training in the past and am actually only a few credits shy of a Fine Arts BA (ended up with a MS in Biochemistry, figure?). The CD I never listened to, but recall enjoying the quality and depth of the illustrated book.However, I have purchased the ""share-ware"" ""Mandala Painting"" program and am considering an online purchase of the ""Mandala Maker"" software. I suggest one use a search engine to find these on the WEB.However, this is really a great package, and maybe a fantastic gift, but if you already have a moderate understanding and experience with Mandalas you may want to check out software packages in addition to this program."
3,the nightclub keeps 'em rollin',"Thrusting bumps, throbbing bass lines that either get the ball rolling or continue where ""Hello Nightclub"" left off. The usual suspects (Richie Havens) and this time out Neneh Cherry play their signature roles in keeping Groove Armada on the dancefloor and drifting further from the expansive shoreline sounds once sending us off into sundrenched dreams found on ""Vertigo."" Don't miss out on ""Madder"" featuring the return of M.A.D. which builds and keeps you up throughout mixing a rap reggae dance rock meld that will be worth repeated listens. This based on initial listen but it is part 2 of ""Goodbye country..."" Close your eyes, bump and roll and stay with it as it stays with you. 3.5 stars."
5,Armada's Best?,"I bought this having heard none of the singles--I've been hooked on Groove Armada since the beginning. This record is such a mish-match of musical styles that at first listen, I wasn't sure what to think. But listening over and over has caused me to truly appreciate the changes and experiements in their sound. Don't be sad--there is still some mellow chillout (""Remember"") and awesome dance (""Lovebox"")--but the rock influence is nothing to sneeze at either. It's definitely a funky album, and I think it's my favorite from GA."
4,Groove is on,"As an owner of all of Groove Armada's albums, I can safely say this is their best yet. If ""Goodbye Country"" was a left turn from the chilled-out style of ""Vertigo"", then ""Lovebox"" completes the U-turn. Now I think I know what Groove Armada was searching for when they made ""Goodbye Country"" (an enjoyable but non-cohesive album) - it's the style Rolling Stone dubbed ""electrocrash"", and it's amazing.Groove Armada's subtly layered tracks best most other electronic artists around these days. Where most groups hit you over the head with their beats, GA slides them in slowly, yet still makes you want to get up and dance. If you don't own this album yet, you should.Favorites:""Groove is on""""Madder""""Easy""""Tuning In (rewritten)"""
4,great but a few songs are not so great,"The band makes a few mis-steps on the release. The first track Purple Haze may have sounded great in the recording studio, but it just sounds like a dance band trying to sound like Jimmie Hendrix (this is a bad idea). The use of an American male rapper isn't a bad idea but it doesn't always work. It sounds like he is singing over the song rather than with it. The 2 down-beat songs are abosultely great though, and there are a few upbeat tracks that are perfectly fine. If you liked their other stuff, you want this CD."
2,why bother?,This seems to be a pretty good band but the cover of CH's 'dream' is basically note-for-note. Even the solo's are virutally the same. Neil Finn's sincere lyrics sound very disingenuous here.
2,Didn't work,"Did not help with frequent cat throwing up, seemed to increase problems rather than help them switched to all canned"
5,I think this book is an amazing adventure!,"i love this book its packed with funny comedy,adventures,and secrets.I cant even pick a favorite character there all so talented.I love how they are all into acting.The ending is sooo SUPRISING!if you want to know the ending you'll have to read the book!!!"
1,Borrrrrring,This book was very boring. Did not keep my interest. Could not stay awake. Not my kind of book at all.
3,"Nice addition to baby's ""orchestra""","This piano is very cute. It is small and lightweight - making it easy for baby to carry around - or for you to carry around while holding baby. My daughter got it a year ago at a garage sale. She still plays with it now at the age of 2. She doesn't play with it for extended periods of time, but she doesn't play with any of her musical instruments for very long - except her drum set :( One thing that frustrated her about this toy is that it didn't come with anything to bang the top part with. Once she played with a friend's xylophone she wanted to play with her piano ""xylophone"" the same way, but she improvised with a drum stick and is now happy as a clam. (are clams happy? where did that expression come from anyway?)"
3,cute but kind of boring,my baby likes this piano for about 5 minutes and then gets bored. A cute idea but not necessarily the best toy out there.
4,Daughter never touches the thing,My daughter got this toy when she was a year old and it still looks new.She hates the thing.I really would not recommend it for a child over 9 months old.Its not entertaining enough for them.
5,A classic toy,"Little Tikes has made this for years. What I like is that the 4 keys are so sounded (is that the word) that they make nice music no matter what you hit. These are very durable, the one we have is second-hand and it looks like new. It isn't loud and NO batteries!"
4,3 Months - 10 Months,"My son was drawn to this piano when he was about 3 months old. The keys are great, needing only the slightest touch to make a sound. The overall quality is good. By my son's 10th month or so, he was a bit bored with it as it only has 4 keys. It's now one of the toys that I put away and pull out so it's new. Our play is different this time around. We take objects and hit the metal bars on top to create noise. This toy has served it's purpose, and I was happy we purchased it for him."
3,WHAT ABOUT MERCURY POISONING?,"This book was an interesting read even for one who doesn't have an autistic child, or even know one. However, as one who is reading extensively about mercury poisoning in order to remove my own, I was startled to see that the author hadn't investigated this. Her son is now 12, did she learn about it later? Did she have him chelated? Laws are now banning thimerosal, with it's mercury content, from vaccinations given to pregnant women and children under three because of this connection. The author made the connection that her son's symptoms began immediately after immunizations, as did the symptoms of other children she discusses. I would like to see an updated version of this book. Try this website for more information on mercury and autism: www.generationrescue.org/"
2,Not Happy,"Before purchasing this product I read several reviews, one of which made reference to the unit changing temperature on its own. I experienced this same proble. I set the temperature for red wine at 58 degrees per the instructions but noticed a fluctual of as much as 5 degrees. When I called Avanti the customer service department was of no help. When I asked to speak with a supervision the line was disconnected. I have yet to receive a reply to either my repeated telephone calls or e-mails.I would not purchase any Avanti product in the future."
3,Bees Don't Get Arthritis,"This book is quite convincing (about the benefits of apitherapy), but it is completely anecdotal. The folksy tone of the writing is a drawback that could put off a reader seriously seeking help with arthritis. Anyone at all skeptical or scientific will want data, and there really is none here. I know individuals who have been helped tremendously by apitherapy (more anecdotal evidence), so I am less skeptical than other serious readers might be. The book increased my belief in the benefits of bee sting therapy, despite the lack of data and scientific analysis."
5,Great Product,"I have been using this eye cream every day for the past 7 years. I've been using Olay products for the past 20+ years, and my co-workers thought I was 10 years younger than my true age. They were amazed to discover my real age when I had a milestone birthday this year. It's great! Total Effects twice a day keeps the wrinkles away."
5,Subtle and Conscious,"While the experience of the monks is paramount and illuminative, there is also direct historical insight to very topical issues regarding struggle in Algeria.The editorial reviewer who wished the book was more linear are mistaken. I agree that the Chris Matthews viewer could have a tough time with this book; I don't think that's the intended audience. It's far from convoluted. I hope the author produces another work of similar depth and readibility soon."
3,Interesting,The Monks of Tibhirine was a difficult read for someone who knows nothing about Catholic teachings and it read like a religious text some of the time but I persevered with it (just skipping here and there) and felt rewarded by the insight into the life in the monastery and the good men who lived there.
3,The Monks of Tibhirine,"The Movie version, ""Monks and Madmen"", captured a beauty that enraptured me spiritually. I purchased the book when the question of where did this take place, on leaving the theater went unanswered? Much information was pushed aside in order to maintain the emotions. I wished to learn more about who, what, where and when so I bought the book. The book neither carries the impact of the movie, or the specifics in facts that I hoped to learn. With the exception of course that I learned it took place in Algeria. The book is terribly dry and lags more as you progress. After page 200 scanning becomes tempting. Highly recommend the film!"
3,"Difficult, but worth reading","This is an enjoyable, but slightly dry book. It is definately hard to actually sit down and read without ones mind trailing off! But as I labored through it I came to enjoy the writers style, and actually feel the importance of the information about the trappist monks of Algeria!"
2,"Ahhhh, no thanks!",Found this book to be a bit too shy of religious content or why these fine men chose the religious life - and too much on relativistic perspectives of everyone else. Which makes it easy to understand why there's a recommendation from a USA State Dept.
4,2002 Chevy Avalanche Extender.,"Bought this for my 2002 Chevrolet Avalanche. The bad first - The mounting hardware is not good.. I spent an extra $5 at the hardware store for heaver duty hardware. Also, it doesn't use the whole tailgate for the extension. This is due to the design of the Avalanche and NOT the bed extender! Be mindful of where you mount it, the ""pins"" that hold the bed extender in place on the bed hit the ""strap hitches"" on the top of the bed. This only happens when you get the maximum length of the bed extender.Other that that I would absolutely buy this product again and recommend it for the Chevy Avalanche!I use it every weekend as my wife and I have a booth at the farmers market and needed the bed to carry all of our gear and produce.If you have an Avalanche, get this extender to complete your Transformer!Autobots! Roll out!"
5,Worth Watching,Beautiful fantasy about a princess who escapes her controlled life. Anything with Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn are always worth watching.
4,Most enjoyable.....,"I am quickly becoming a fan of Audrey's. Until recently, I had not seen many of her films. The more I see, the more I like her. Gregory Peck was the perfect choice. A lovely story."
5,The Kiss,"Call me a sap, but the whole movie is the kiss between Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn after they have come out of the river and are dripping wet."
5,Great movie,One of if not the best Audrey Hepburn film ever!!!!!!What a great actress the film that made her the worlds most beautiful women.
5,I'm not a romance fan.,"I'm not a romance fan, and I thought this was a great movie because of the ending. I also liked the way that Hepburn's character doesn't act like so many female characters in older films - she doesn't flop on the bed and weep like a child when something bad happens. Eddie Albert does a good job in a supporting role as the photographer helping Gregory Peck get the story."
1,Not good,"The strainer arrived with the smaller holes at the bottom of the strainer sealed. I had to open them with an awl. And the larger drain slots along the sides are *way* too big. Most pasta flows right through the side. Unless you plan to strain large items and don't mind a little work with an awl, run from this one. I've already given mine away."
4,Female Vocalist Trance at its most tasteful,"If you're into solid trance with killer bass and great vocals(is it really trance if it's vocal??) then this cd is perfect for your taste. Awesome songs from the likes of 4 strings, etc. This is the best vocal trance you can get your hands on. I'm not big into vocal crowned songs, but this cd entices me greatly and i have got to give it a very good rating. Drawbacks are, as other reviews will tell you, some cheese when it came to the vocals, but the rest of the beats and overall performance of the album is great(skip the opera trance, it's murder to even listen to hear class culture mixed with high energy club culture- it's like mixing a bad drink of fine wine and red bull)but enjoy the rest of this delightful cd."
2,Disappointed,There's nothing like fresh Bassetts All Sorts - but this product did not have the freshness I was looking for in fact they were just this side of stale. The pkg was awful - it was crammed into the smallest priority envelope and by the time it got to me half of the candy was hanging out. Not a good experience.
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased the 5 pound bag of Bassets Licorice Allsorts as a Christmas gift for my mom. Sadly to say, I am embarassed to give this as a gift. The inside of the bag is covered with smudges from the candy. Each piece of candy is also covered with black smudges from the black licorice. It looks like some serious melting took place along the line. I am going to have to throw it out. Does anyone know how I can get a refund?? I should have listened to what people said about this product in previous reviews! Very disappointed about this purchase!!!!"
2,licorice allsorts 5 pound bag,"Licorice came quickly, sooner than arrival date, but quality was poor. I thought Bassetts would be best brand but it wasn't. Some of it was melted too. Won't buy this product again. Haribo brand allsorts licorice was better."
5,Great Reference Book,I just started cooking more whole foods and this book was a wonderful reference. It is great to keep in the kitchen near your recipe book. Well organized and the pictures are extremely helpful.
1,bed rail,I cannot recommend this product. The picture shows the dual 30 inch model and what you get for $100 is a single 18 inch wide rail that should be about $45. Big ripoff!
3,Don't get this one for the reproductions,"I think I made a mistake when ordering and accidentally got this book instead of Trippi's hardcover. The narrative is interesting and insightful, but the reproductions are an outrage. Black and white for Circe Ividiosa and for (gasp) THE MAGIC CIRCLE??? Come on! Black and white should only be used to make a point about light and shade or for lesser works and studies. But there are several masterworks reproduced in B/W in this book. Also, the color reproductions are lousy as well. 3 stars overall out of respect for the author, but 1 star for the plates."
4,Ann Taylor's memories of filiming Salome,Weird to see this old movie of ours on DVD. This was filmed mainly in the basement of my sister's florist's shop in Liverpool where some of the paintings for the set are still on the walls. We seemed to recut and re film so many times over a period of years that I can't recall ever thinking that the movie was finished. Still there it is for you hardened Barker fans - would have been nice if they spelt my name right!!! Ann Taylor
4,I love these,These are great spandex shorts. They are really good quality and it is easy to move around in them. They are a bit short but to me that makes it more comfortable. I am very happy with my purchase!!
3,Beer Commercial Gone Awry,"The Caesars sound a bit like all the other retro-y bands as of late. Not to say that's a bad thing. Very good music, you always know it's a keeper when one of the tracks is entitled 'Suzie Creamcheese', making one think of the Stones Roses 'Sally Cinnamon' or the Rolling Stones 'Ruby Tuesday'. Songs that have strange chick names in the titles always rock my socks. The Caesars are possibly best known for that beer commercial in which the lesson do not drink in the drycleaners is well taught. If you do, you may be subjected to pointing at your best friend amidst foamy bubbles while in the background some greasy rocker screeches `Kick you out, let the sun shine in'. Good one."
2,It's just okay,"I chose this book because ""Awareness"" is in the title. Although I wasn't expecting a lot of nuggets, I did expect some. Unfortunately, none were to be found. Instead, this book reads like a session with a psychologist - and not a very good one at that. The author begins by writing, ""If you have picked up this book, then odds are that in someway you feel dissatisfied with your life."" Again, that is not why I chose this book. Warning - this is the theme of the book. The author's own words sometimes weigh down the pages with emotional dissatisfaction.Much of the advice is written in generalities. Often times, emotional issues were lumped together as if a one-off, cure-all by being ""aware"" will resolve any and all emotional problem. Sure, awareness is the first step and yes, gaining control of your emotions is important. However, if you are looking for sound emotional advice, you should see a licensed professional."
3,"Good, but very basic.","Good book, but if you've read a lot in this genre, you may be surprised how basic it is. No a-ha's, just practical advice. And there's nothing wrong with that. I just was looking for the same kind of fascinating stuff that I got from Eckhard Tolle's ""Power of Now""."
1,"Sterling Silver Pink , Dark Blue, Green, Red, Green, and Light Blue Crystal Flower Earrings",I'm not sure if it's silver
3,Marchlands,"This book was okay. When I set it down, I didn't have any great urge to pick it back up. There was no need to find out how it all ends. I really enjoy a book that is an escape. This book just didn't have it for me."
2,Left empty,"Fabulous imagery, involving story, but characters left me feeling empty. I could not put the book down as I was reading, but when done, I wanted to wash myself clean of these people."
5,Essential and Historic!,"Well, after Coleman, Cooley, Killoran, O'Brien, and OC the modern - but sadly rarely recorded, Paddy Cronin ( Irish Traditional Fiddler ) ..to mention a few and not leaving out Matt Molloy 'An Ri na Ceol' IMHO - I thought I had heard it all.Wrong!This is not merely essential, it is the foundation of modern Itrad since it contains everything and some more that modern and earlier exponents of the art are striving to express but not quite delivering the goods.If you want to be astonished and surprised again like the first time you heard Coleman, Cooley or indeed any of the great exponents of the art, then go buy and be reborn to a new level of Irtrad!"
3,Decent value but nothing special.,"I had to send the first one back because the battery backup didn't work. Beyond that, it is a decent machine without a lot of features. The sound quality is fine and the message is clear when you call up. My only complaint is that it is difficult to erase individual messages. If you just hit ""erase"" in the middle of the message it won't go away. You have to listen to the whole thing then hit the button at just the right time to get rid of that message. Otherwise you have to either erase all of them or listen again."

4,Honest and positive,"Very interesting and encouraging to read. I don't always agree with him, but I can see his reasons for believing as he does. I think that his book gives a very honest and positive assessment of America and its politics."
2,Glad he wrote it,"I am glad I read this book. I had not decided who to vote for in 2008, and now I am positive that I am not voting for Obama. Other reviews were encouraged or inspired or thought the tone was hopeful. I do not agree. I thought it was a lot of rambling about everything that's wrong with America with the occasional self-congratulatory pot shot at a former running opponent or journalist thrown in. His solutions tend to be written in terms of what repulicans want to do or tried to do and why he disagrees. One positive -- the writing is very candid. I was actually kind of surprised that a presidential hopeful would reveal this much in print. You can at least get a very clear view of who he thought he was when he wrote this book -- which leads me to point out another surprise of mine, why aren't his opponents using more of the stuff in this book against him?"
4,Too early to tell....,"Perhaps it is too early to begin thinking about 2008 (after all, 2007 hasn't even started), but there is no doubt that Obama will be a powerful force in politics, whether he decides he wants to run for president or not.The most appealing aspect of the book is that he seems like a moderate, and at times, he even leaves room for the fact that his views have not been fully developed. I think that in this era of polarizing views and the entire ""your either with us or against us"" movement in politics, this book is a breath of fresh air - air for the hope that lives inside us all. Enjoy."
4,Obama...a new world,Good read.This man clearly has a view as to how a really successful government could work.Sadly it is based on bypartisan politics and nobody in the world has achieved this .....yet
1,The Audacity of this Guy Taking Your Money,"This book is nothing more than an obvious attempt at riding the political fence. Obama has dozens of idealistic views such as empathy for all and health care for everyone -- yet no plans or even realisitic ideas as to the implication of these ideals. This book is 350+ pages of fluff and should be read by no one, it is clearly attempting to appeal to everyone while making no solid stance of its own, and is hence a complete waste of money and time."
3,"articulate, but dull","As a follow up to his very engaging autobiography this book was a huge and boring disappointment to me. It reads way too much like pure campaign rhetoric. I find it much easier to like the man than to like his politics or his rhetoric, so I didn't care for this book at all."
1,Think Happy Thoughts,"Pretty much what one would expect from someone with a limited understanding of how the world works outside the South Side of Chicago. An admirable individual no doubt, and one suitable to work as a community activist, but Mr. Obama's idealism seems incredibly naive when faced with fighting terrorists who won't hesitate to kill 3,000 innocent civilians or saw off the heads of reporters. His apparent lack of education of history and basic economics is breathtaking, and if elected, will lead to a four years of chaos and a return of Republicans to power. Yes we can...."
1,Hope?Ha!!!!!!!!!!!!,This 'One' who is setting himself up as a 'Messiah' gives me the creeps.He is setting himself as a savior of theworld.His articulateness and the media propping his enormous popularity reminds me of a 'sheep' Hitler.Justbecause he has no bloodlust doesn't make him any harmless.I feel his legacy would be ending America's gre-atness and I think of that not in racial terms as I myself isn't Caucasian.
1,Didn't meet expectations,I expected a little less fluff and a little more substance. I was greatly disappointed.
4,Audacity of Hope Review,Motivational for a young 21 year old American like meRecommend this to all patriotic Americans who want to learn from an incredible human being in President Obama
2,Audacity of Hype,"The timing is perfect. Hit the book market then run for President. But Mr. Obama is just not ""there"" yet. Others have attempted to be the next JFK. Obama isn't the one."
1,The Audacity of This Self-Engrossed Man,"What will Barack's new book be- ""The Audacity of a Marxist""? This man is not brilliant (any man who is dependent on a teleprompter does not have much ""up there"") and all he does in these books & elsewhere is preach his radical Leftist ideology, framing it in clever words like ""Hope"", & ""Change"". Interesting that the Barack Obama Wall Calendars are falling steeply each year in their appeal to people. The 2009 wall calendar had about 50 positive reviews, but the 2010 calendar had about 12 total reviews, and his 2011 wall calendar has a paltry 2 reviews. Hah! People aren't buying into this snakeoil-saleman's ""hope & change"" anymore!! God bless America and protect her against such anti-American, anti-hope people like Mr. Obama."
2,Platitudes,"Typical collection of political pap and platitudes. Nothing earth shaking. If you want to read something that will open your eyes to what we are politically up against, read America Alone by Mark Steyn."
2,Over-rated.,"This book is highly over-rated. I found it to be typical and gushy. Obama is obviously very biased by his faith. I did not see the ""insight"" in his writing that other people mention here. I do not see why it is number one at amazon. Please, do yourself a favor and do not buy a copy."
4,Future President?,I have grown to love and respect Obama through this book and have actually purchased a second copy to share with friends. I think he is an exceptional person and that he would make a dignified and capable leader of our nation.
3,All things to all men,"Reading this will give you a sense of the man Obama. He demonstrates a high level of reasoning while considering various sides of complex problems. But, you will also find a simmering distrust just below the surface. Reading in the book that the title is taken from the title of one of Obabma's favorite sermons of Rev. Wright perhaps reveals a different meaning of the title. Who believes who has the audacity to hope? Considering that Rev. Wright authored that phrase it just does not seem as hopeful. But all in all, a good read, especially after reading Newt's book for comparison."
3,The Nobel Prize,"Barack Obama's Nobel Prize proves how good he is at Peace, just as his Energy Secretary Steven Chu's Nobel Prize proves how good he is at Physics."
1,Oy Vey!,I had to read this Tripe for School. Ugh! His idea of reclaiming the American Dream is Socialism! I hope we wake up and boot him out of office before he runs us another few Trillions in debt.
4,not finished listenening,"So far so good, I just have not listened to the whole book. Delivery was timely."
1,Audacity of vapour,"This book is, basically, a collection of feel-good platitudes. I didn't find any serious discussion or analysis of the causes of the current problems facing America. This is not surprising, giving the author's glaring ignorance in economics and history. The author ostensibly calls for a change, but if one actually thinks about how that change is going to be implemented, it is still the same old American Socialism.If you care for the truth, this one is not for you; on the other hand, I'd recommend it heartily if you feel threatened by the winds of change. Everything's going to be ok, really. We just need to believe really really hard that the nanny State will be nice."
4,negative posters,"Notice the people that are leaving negative comments are the ones bringing up racial issues and name calling? Yet I dont recall once where Obama has ever really brought up race except to say in equality. Even when he mentioned Martin Luther King, he referred to him as ""a preacher from Georgia"". Not a black man, or a white man, an American. Do yourself a favor and actually read his book or actually listen to his speeches, esp ""A more perfect union"". He truly is trying to turn the page and move forward together, hence the title."
5,Book review,Extremely well written. Gives you hope. Happy to know someone in government really thinks this way.
2,All talk and no action,"I tried and I tried and I tried to read this book. Now that he is the presumptive Democratic Party candidate for the U.S. President, I thought it was time I read something about him. This book didn't tell me anything.He is the champion of writing super long run-on sentences. You get done reading one and you have no idea what he just said. Some sentences take up an entire paragraph! He tries to dumb down the use of big words but it is just the sentence structure that made the book totally unreadable for me. He brings up some interesting questions about our culture in general, about the two party political system, about religion, etc. but he makes no attempt at providing any answers. Now obviously this book was written before he got into any Presidential campaign, but if he was asking these questions back then, why did'nt he provide any solutions in his primary platform? One has to wonder if this guy is all talk and no action??? FOr our country's sake, I hope not."
1,Are you all serious?,"I can't believe a man like this would even be considered president. This man doesn't place his hand over this heart during the pledge of elegance, and doesn't say the pledge.He is full of empty promises. For one universal health care. Universal health care doesn't work. Look at Canada. If you get cancer you have to wait in a ""line"" before receiving treatment, by time you receive treatment it may be to late.Canadian doctors won't perform surgery unless they know the outcome is better than 80%. There are 1000s of Canadians who come to the US for surgeries. Why would we do this to ourselves?If this happens to us, where are we going to go for surgery if our surgeons aren't going to perform the surgery? It isn't because they don't want to. When health care is free they have to be selective with how they spend money. This guy will only hurt the US."
4,"Fine album, but not one of his best.","In my opinion, Songs for a Tailor is Jack's best album, with Harmony Row a close second. Simply put, they are masterpieces. HOW'S TRICKS, which came years later, is a fine effort, but not of the same calibre as the others just mentioned. Fans of his earlier work will enjoy hearing Jack's distinctive voice here and his fluid bass playing that sounds almost like a tuba. Most of the lyrics are similar to those in his early work, very surrealistic. There are several straightforward rock songs here like Baby Jane that don't do much for me. But, overall, a fine effort. I have never heard the CD, but have an old vinyl LP, which I enjoy hearing from time to time. I recommend HOW'S TRICKS for long-time fans. But newbies should start with his best work, Songs for a Tailor or Harmony Row."
3,Ehh...,"Good for a quick watch. No full fights. Just the last few seconds of them. REALLY short! Seriously, a 60 minute blu-ray? LOL!Weak extras.Quality is great though."
5,AN ANSWER TO A PARENT'S PRAYER!,"I bought this book recently to see if there was anything I could do to bring Peace into our chaotic household, and have found it to be amazingly accurate and very user-friendly. As I read the first few chapters, I was literally wondering if they had installed secret cameras in my house, because the authors were describing our life so accurately. With 5 children under the age of 12, of course there is always going to be some chaos, but when you add ADHD and BiPolar Disorder to the mix, it becomes a whole different story. The tips in each chapter and the 'Pointers for Parenting' were extremely helpful, but I especially liked that they included quotes from the author's son, who also struggled with ADHD- it was great to read a child's perspective on things. I highly recommend this book to any parent out there with a special needs child, or just a plain old defiant adolescent. It has made a positive impact on our lives, and I am very thankful to have found it."
4,Great product,"I have allergies to most of the chemicals that are in shampoo's today - so was very happy when I found this. Doesn't lather very well, so I have to use more than I want to which stings cause of the price factor - but it does a fabulous job without making me breakout - so it's worth the price."
4,"Beautiful glasses, but not the quality I expected.","These glasses are a nice weight, well-designed both aesthetically and and functionally, but the glass that they are fashioned from is just a bit sub-standard. I like the glasses and they were reasonably priced for everyday use, but upon close inspection, there are small flaws in many of the glasses, and the buyer should be aware of this fact, especially if choosing these as a gift."
1,Signal goes to one side only - after a month of moderate use,"At first it was OK, I use it on my computer. Suddenly one side stooped getting signal.I had cheap panasonic before - it lasted me years. Have to buy panasonic again."
2,"Promising concept, weak realization","In concept, this release is a wonderful idea: a disc of new holiday-themed music from a wide variety of living composers.The result, however, is rather disappointing. Not only is the music of astoundingly variable musical quality (ranging from rather strong to unbelievably weak), but more significantly, the Ukrainian singers (both in choral and solo selections) have absolutely horrific English diction. This is not an issue for the few selections in Latin, but the majority of the works are choral or solo pieces in English by American composers, and the performances are both unintelligible and extremely unsatisfying. (The instrumental and orchestral playing is fine; some of the tracks are purely instrumental.)ERM has generally done quite well in its extensive ""Masterworks of the New Era"" series (though the music also varies widely in quality). This album, however, is an unfortunate disappointment."
4,Nice Song,"Kandi is one of my favorite singers ever. When she came out with her hit ""Don't Think I'm Not"", I knew I had to have her CD. I was in Wal-Mart one day and noticed Kandi's CD single for the song ""Cheatin' On Me"", which then I had never heard before.I purchased the CD right away! I like Tracks 1,2, and 3. The original vesion(Track 5) is OK, but tracks 1,2, and 3 are all remixes. One thing about Kandi is she usually sings about her men cheatin' on her."
4,Where Has Kandi Gone,This is a pretty good cd. I found it at a local Wal-Mart and bought it right away. Here's what i got with my copy.1. Cheatin' On Me (Track Master Remix) [2:53]2. Cheatin' On Me (Track Master Remix) [2:53](Featuring 50 Cent)3. Cheatin' On Me (A-Foc-Alipse Remix) [3:46]4. Cheatin' On Me (Track Master Instrumental) [2:53]5. Cheatin' On Me (Lp Version) [3:54]Track no. 2 is the better of the songs on the cd. The track master mix is almost completely reworded.
1,Not worth the trouble,"I purchased this vehicle for my son's 5th birthday. He is really into cars and trucks and remote control vehicles. It has been three days and we still cannot get this thing working correctly, it dies out almost immediately after playing with it for a few minutes. Maybe the battery is a dud or maybe it's the vehicle. But one additional thing is the box gives you the impression you only need to buy the batteries seperately which is two 'AA' batteries. But in all actuality you have to buy a 30.00 flex pax battery too. Very misleading. Very not worth it."
4,Find your own peace,"I've read numerous martial arts books and articles and found The Art of Empty Self a refreshing and thought-provoking change of pace from the usual. Not a history or biography book, not a personal journey or even a narrative, this is a collection of insights and observations --some pages are only one or two sentences long-- which would be helpful to any true student of martial arts. I feel that I could read this book again every year and find something new speaking to me!The strident objections given in the other review are actually amusing considering the advice given throughout the book."
3,Good,"I was reading a magazine when I put the cd in and by the third track I put the magazine down and grabbed my headphones. It didn't blow me away, but it was a worthy purchase and will make some appearances in my stereo down the road. Good saturday morning music."
5,ONE OF THEIR BEST CDS!,"I LOVE EVERY SONG ON THIS CD, WHEN I FIRST GOT IT I COULDNT STOP LISTENING TO IT, I LISTENED TO IT FOR 2 OR 3 MONTHS SOLID!!"
2,Time to shut it down?,"I was greatly disappointed with this book. It'sthe weakest of his that I've read. It almost seems as if someone else wrote it for him using his previous books as the base material. I've enjoyed all of his books, and I've read most of them, but they are getting stale. Unfortunately, he seems to to be overusing the flashback vehicle in his other series as well. Maybe the new Codename series will give him a fresh outlook."
1,Tyranny In The Ashes,"I first became acquainted with Mr. Johnstone's wonderful series four years ago when I discovered his first novel in a used book store. I have, over the years, managed to collect a copy of each succeeding novel in this series and until now have spent many a happy hour reading and re-reading the Ashes books. Until now!For some reason Mr. Johnstone has written a book that seems, to me, to be a feeble effort to keep the series going. Like many of his readers I am more than willing to put up with pages of flash backs to other novels, his political agenda (much of which I agree with) and his latent homophobia, IF the end result is a good read, which this, his latest effort, is not.I would much rather have waited another year and read another fine, cracking tale from Mr. Johnstone's pen than this drivel.A major disappointment and I sincerely hope that Mr. Johnstone will return to us the fine novels he writes so well."
2,Tyranny in the Ashes,"After reading this book, I feel that it was not written by Johnstone. I feel the writer was obtuse and lacking. This is also with about the last 12 books or so. There was research done, however, it appears that it was not researched enough. I felt maistakes were made in the area of weapons, locations, and attitudes of people at some locations mentioned. Also the price of the books and not being able to find some of the books. Think goodness for Kindel, Nook, etc. Johnstone is a very good writer, has his own style, which is good, but a Louis Lamour he's not. Needs to do a little more research about people, and those that WILL defend their country and family. There's more than what he's thanks, and more detest what our government has become."
1,another world entertainment(awe) danish print is restored.,both the early 2000's anchor bay print and all versions of the blu-underground print have two scenes out of place.get an all region dvd player and go to sinerama2 and get it from them ask for trevor. theirs is fully restored.in is a region 2 format. and a much better print.
4,Good Slasher Movie,"Fulci was in top form for this New York Italian slasher whodunit. You won't know who the culprit is until almost the end. Some scenes, especially late in the movie, are hard to watch. I also enjoyed the grand tour of New York City."
1,old hat - nothing new,Typical horror flick with some gory stuff thrown in. Nothing new nor inventive for suspense or excitement.tlee
5,Born again Astronomer,"Great book for anyone wanting to go deeper into amateur astronomy. Many background topics are covered in the first portion of the book leading into the observational delights in the last chapters. I use this book for light reading and to plan observing lists for clear nights to come. The breakout of objects by category is great. The objects are listed by what instrument will be necessary for best viewing, ie binoculars, small telescope..."
4,"Advanced Skywatching is good, but there is one better","Advanced Skywatching is a good book. But the book ""Practical Skywatching"" gives you two books for the price of one. It literally contains the best of the books ""Skywatching"" and ""Advance Skywatching"" in one reference"
5,This really WAS something new!,"I must admit this in my mind stands out among larry's other releases, due to the absence of lush orchestration, of which I am not a big fan of, mainly on rock lps. Being a fan of raw blues and rock, I love the way he really lets loose with here with tunes like Born to be Unlucky and Watch What you're Doing, which not only rock you but exhort you speak mof God's love and transforming power to save and redeem.Larry sings the blues like King David of old, who I am sure is a big Larry Norman fan by now, up there in glory gigging with him accompanied by the harp, lyre, timbrel and stratocaster! Long live Larry's legacy which gave me years of pleasure, and inspired many."
4,Superb Must-Have,A superb must-have guide deserving serious attention by all assistants. Be prepared for a journey through the behind the scenes of the Rich & Famous with Bonnie!
4,They did it again,"Never, ever, did Ace of Base came out with a bad album. This one is again very good. Anoter classic for AOB fans"
1,Sappy Pap!,"My God, where is Shawn when we need him? Lillian Ross' paean to Bill and Tina needs Shawn's ball-pointed editor's pen like potholes need tar."
1,Execrable,Poor Shawn! He seems to have had impeccable taste in everything save mistresses. The misbegotten issue of their liaison is this unique instance of a grotesque lapse in editorial judgement. I cannot imagine prose as wretched as this surviving his meticulous blue pencil from anyone sufficiently detached from him to be regarded as a writer worthy of regard on the basis solely of his work.
4,A Thoughtful Perspective On A Pivotal Era,"What made the 1930's such an important era for professional baseball? How did the game evolve as both a sport and a business? How did the developments of this era influence the shape of the game in the decades that followed? These are some of the themes explored by historian and baseball fan Charles Alexander in ""Breaking The Slump.""Alexander's greatest gift seems to be for biography; his lives of John McGraw and Ty Cobb are true standouts in baseball literature. In trying to cover the sweep of an entire decade in this volume, he sometimes loses sight of his larger perspectives, but on balance, this is a very worthwhile effort. Alexander's prose is clear, it flows well, and he does have a knack for digging out forgotten nuggets of the game's history.If you want to know more about the heyday of Hank Greenberg, Jimmie Foxx, Carl Hubbell, Mel Ott and Dizzy Dean, this is a worthwhile, mostly satisfying book.--William C. Hall"
5,Works as well or better than leading detergent,"I usually use a leading detergent, but I picked this up at a local natural foods store. I have been very pleasantly surprised. It cleans very well and the scent is wonderful. I have diapers to wash which is a real test. After washing with the leading detergent, there was still a bit of a nasty smell. After washing with method, they smelled fresh and clean! I like that it's a natural product as well."
3,"nice, but falls short","where do I start..... first, this is a nice and for many people an enjoyable CD. That said, it must be pointed out that it is only so-so (at best) in relation to the (only a few) high quality Zimbabwe marimba bands that exist today or have ever existed. It all springs from the pioneering bands of Dumisani Maraire (including his first, and many people would say the best ever and unsurpassed marimba band, Dumi and the Minanzi Marimba Ensemble). As a matter of perspective, this CD should be considered on par with a growing pack of similar (and rather average/ho-hum quality) marimba bands."
4,"Great toy, but be careful!","I think this toy is adorable, and my son loves it too! He is nearly a year old, and has been playing with it for months. However, and I know this goes without saying, but make sure your baby is supervised when playing with this toy! My son was playing with it, and I was right there with him, and he put it in his mouth. Somehow he got the face of the fish wedged in his mouth, with his upper teeth in the line of the fish mouth, and his lower teeth behind the top of the fish head! It took a minute to get him unstuck, and he was pretty freaked out by it, but no harm done. He still loves the toy, and I still let him play with it."
5,Clear and very readable,"I do not appear to have read this edition. The one I read was printed in 1907 by The Roycrofters Shop in East Aurora, N.Y. and was translated by Lascelles Wraxall. But if this is the same work, it is a very readable book, full of the elan and verve one expects from Victor Hugo. After reading it one can see why Wellington said Waterloo was ""a very near run thing."" The picture Hugo paints, complete with insightful observations made at the battlefield in 1861, is one well worth reading. I enjoyed it much."
1,For Older Mac Operating Systems Only,"Does not work on Mac OSX 10.6. Per Scholastic tech support, ""If you have a newer Mac machine with one of the later OS versions (10.4 or later) the game will not work as it was meant to run on an older system."""
4,"JOSEPH LOSEY, OPUS 7","The well-known Losey touch can be seen for the first time here, in his first movie directed in England. The Sleeping Tiger is part Film Noir part psychological drama with such highly Losey-an themes as Manipulation, What's Left Unsaid and Innuendo. If you like Henry James and Tcheckhov, you'll adore Joseph Losey. Highly recommended.Nota Bene: if you want to see a perfect copy of this film, you'll have to buyJoseph Losey Collection - 8-DVD Box Set ( The Big Night / The Sleeping Tiger / The Criminal / Eva / The Servant / Accident / The Go-Between / Mr. Klein ) ( The Concrete Jungle / Ev [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom]."
2,Two Thumbs Down,"If you are a L&C fan who loves romance and action stories, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. It stinks! Here are some reasons why:a) Half the time Superman is in Russia while Lois lane is visiting her ex-boyfriend, Lex. b) The narrator makes Clark look forgetful and careless. c) If you're going to write some action about Superman, at least make it interesting (I was bored to tears). d) If you ask me, the story wasn't well written anyway. Take my advice and save your money."
4,A diffrent Lois & Clark,"If you are expectin something like you see on theabc's TV show you probably won't read it. Thestory line iss good but the numerous descriptivesparts may be a little boring and may that your attentionaway. I missedt a little action, in some chaptersit is too passive and it leads you to lose theinterest"
4,Wonderful tv tie in novel that stands on it's own 2 feet,"As a fan of ""Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"", I have to say that Cheeryh's portrayal of their relationship, and the characters themselves, was spot on for me. She did a marvellous job of conveying the depth of feeling the two characters have for one another, and portrayed a realistic relationship that was all the stronger for it's rocky patches. The plot is top notch, and rings true and while a lot less flamboyant than the series scripts in many ways, it remained true to the unique premise of this 1990s version of the Man of Steel and the Planet's ace reporter. I can't recommend this book enough, and hope that all the FoLCs enjoy re-reading it as much as I do."
4,Spreadsheet experts stay in balance,"It is my great pleasure to comment on Van Bloch's textbook on EXCEL for engineers and scientists. His marvellous ability to communicate complicated ideas in simple terms shines through on every page. More than just useful, this book comes to market at a time when electronic spreadsheet analysis has become part and parcel of the day-to-day work of researchers in all areas of engineering and science. Simply put, spreadsheet and data manipulation skills are essential in today's world. Prof. Bloch does his reader's a great service by developing the concepts for use with EXCEL, one of the most widely used spreadsheets in the world. The CD-ROM will be especially helpful to students as they seek to master spreadsheet basics and more advanced techniques."
2,What Went Wrong,"At least the original ran for an entire season. This ""reimaging"" lasted six episodes before ABC pulled the plug and took it off life support. Despite the participation of people from the X-Files and the original Night Stalker. What they forgot was the sense of fun of the original and turned it into something darker than Millenium! (Hard to imagine.) Carl Kolchak is a bumbling reporter trying to get back to the bigtime who continually encounters stories that no one can believe. In the new version he is not rumpled Darren McGavin but a rather more urbane Stuart Townsend. Driven by the mysterious death of his family he is on a quest to uncover the truth. (His companion is obnxious). For completists."
4,This Movie Is About UXORICIDE!,"That's what the poster ads warned! UXORICIDE! (look it up). William Castle's ""I Saw What You Did"" is a great little suspense drama, with a perky cast and an intriguing story. Left alone one night while their parents are out of town, teen-aged Libby, her little sister Tess, and Libby's visiting friend Kit amuse themselves by making crank phone calls. They especially enjoy crooning ""I saw what you did and I know who you are"" to their victims. Unfortunately, one of their calls hits the bullseye--a homicidal maniac who has just murdered his wife. Tense and atmospheric, with delightful performances from Andi Garrett, Sarah Lane and Sharyl Locke as the kids, and strong ones from John Ireland as the psychopath, and the one-and-only Joan Crawford (straight from Castle's ""Strait-Jacket"") as his blackmail-minded neighbor. The 1988 television remake is terrible. Avoid it and stick with the original! [phillindholm]"
3,DVD edition review,"The film is great, and so is the transfer to DVD. But, I am very disappointed that Anchor Bay released this title in only one channel sound, not two, or even four channel. However, this is still a great film, and, yes, I finally noticed that chandlier around Miss Crawford's neck. Would love to see the 1988 remake someday."
5,This movie is the freakiest coolest 60's movie ever!,"This movie was so cool! I loved it! It had a great cast, it had a little humor and the black and white humor make it probably the scariest movie since the haunting. The girls did a great job and it would look great on DVD. Get It...and watch it tonight."
4,I bought mine used for $20 and I love it,"I bought mine used for $20 so I was very pleased with the nice large picture and the fact that it can be used as a tv also. My screen has gone blank a few times. I just unplug the power from under it and put it right back in. Works great and not all that inconvenient, so if you have this problem, hopefully this info will help. I love mine."
3,Like the screen hate the icon,What I like about this is its clear picture and wide screen size for the price. But MAN why does the Gateway icon stay on the screen so long when I turn the thing on??? I'll turn on the monitor to send an email and I have to sit there for what seems like forever before the icon goes away telling me it's a ^%$# Gateway monitor!!!
2,Disturbed,"Despite the fact I liked Nia and Seth, I was sorely disappointed that they fell in love with no tension, no conflict. I also was disappointed in the author's rendition of a vampire. I enjoy the struggle a vampire has between its good and bad side. The fact they killed their quarry disgusted me.I'm far from faint of heart, but could not get past the innocent lives taken."
3,satisfied,"I have owned this for about 2 years now. I use it infrequently, but when I do, it works well. I took it camping once about 6 months ago. It was definitely not as convenient as my friends' battery- and gas-powered lanterns, because theirs lasted for hours while this on full-charge lasted around 40 minutes, and then I had to stop and keep cranking it up. So it's NOT a good product if you want hours of light. But for a quick emergency 10-minute flashlight, it gives wonderful peace-of-mind knowing that you always have a light source and don't have to worry about dead batteries.Some other reviewers said theirs has ""died"" and doesn't hold a charge anymore; I don't use mine enough nowadays to know whether that's the case or not. But I suppose these things are cheap enough that you could replace it every several years and still save compared to buying batteries."
3,don't lose your faith,Nightmares has 4 vignettes:1.) a nasty video game that consumes JJ (Emilio Estevez)2.) a psychopathic killer that almost gets smoker(Christina Raines)3.) A Satanic black Chevy truck trying to kill a faithless priest(Lance Henrickson)and 4.) a dumb story of Giant Rodent ... at a dopey husband( I forget his name)an enjoyable movie nontheless
4,Hard Core Tesla,"The casual coiler might have difficulty extracting usable information from the text, as it is not a how to book. It is, however a great insight into Tesla's mind. There are plenty of drawings and handwritten notes to keep the reader engrossed, and thinking about his next project. The book is fairly well assembled with a few new pictures, but personally I would like to see more pictures of his lab if they are available. This book is a must have for any enthusiast or collector."
5,WONDERFUL & HEARTWARMING WORDS OF WISDOM,"A daily treat filled with wise, simple and profound insights. I give this calendar to my Mom every year for Christmas -- and she loves it too!"
5,Great event!!!,I remember watching this when it first aired.......i just recently got this on Blu-ray and I LOVE IT!!! I would prefer the entrances to be unedited tho.......but its a great BD release...they need more events on BD!! It looks really nice in 1080i
2,NO workout...,"I was very excited about joining the pilates craze with this equipment. It seemed like a great deal. However, like the other review mentions, there is no actual workout included. The video only walks through each move once with one side. The video and manual instruct you to a website for a workout, but it costs a monthly fee to join the website. Overall, I am very disappointed. I would LOVE to know if anyone has found an accompanying video that works as an actual workout. Otherwise, you're stuck with great equipment and absolutely nothing to do with it!"
3,Inside a Thugs Heart,"I agree with most of the other people that commented on this book, Angela was definitely played. I think the book would have been much better without all of her comments (fantasies.) It was nice to see another side of Tu Pac through his letters to her."
1,Inside of the heart of a played female,"Boooooooooring! Homechick tripped me out, sharing her lewd fantasies with the world. It was plain to me that Pac used her as a distraction while behind bars. If she wasn't beautiful he wouldn't have given her and her letter the time of day. And his constant requests for more pictures...what do you think he was doing with them??? Why didn't he try to make something happen with her upon his release? In the media I've heard about his relationship with Jada and even Keshia is mentioned. But no word of any Angela. She was straight up used and played. Maybe she thought having ""exclusive"" Tupac letters made her special but the book only served to bring to light how foolish she was."
3,NOT IMPRESSED,"I love Tupac for his insight I loved the book because I loved to hear Tupacs poetry, thoughts, and ideas. I hated the book because it was boring and coniving. The author must be crazy she should be ashamed for putting his secrets and others in a book to be published he would not be happy with that. This book is not what I expected - I expected more than just copies of his love letters between him and the author. Please don't waste your time!"
1,Junk,Total junk - put it on MAX to solder RC plane battery wires - does not work. I will have to get a different tool now
3,"cute, but probably not for heavy use","soft, plastic, seems flimsy. Probably not ideal for heavy use. Looks great in our lightly-used spare bathroom. No problems, but I just don't have too much faith"
3,Mayched my shower curtain,Not happy with it because unless the lids down you don't see the fish. We normally have the seat up! lol So I was disappointed in that
3,cushy,"I had one before, and enjoyed the soft seat. Eventually the soft seat ripped, and I got a similar product, which sort of matched my shower curtain. When that one broke, I went back to this one. Don't really understand the ""embroidered"" designation, since it's just printed vinyl, but it is fairly nice and cushy.The only complaint is that it does eventually rip, and it stains fairly easily. We got diarrhea stains off using the plastic stain remover for removing tomato stains from plastic storage containers."
3,"Entertaining, but hardly profound.","Unlike a previous reviewer, I did not miss the battle scenes. Unlike another, I was not surprised by the ending. And unlike one other, I can spell ""prose."" *grin*The story was fun and moderately interesting, if not crafted like a fine Tiffany vase. I was, however, disappointed in one major element. I was hoping that once taken outside the confines of the comic book format, Byrne could concentrate on developing the character of Diana, Princess of Themiscyra, in greater depth. I found very little of this. Most of the characters (Diana especially) were a bit two-dimensional and very unsurprising. Rather bland, if truth be told. Regardless, it is an entertaining quick read, if you're not interested in anything profound. Good for a plane trip or something equally as mundane."
4,First Time User,"Since this is a new technique for me, I tried the first level at least seven times and finally understood what was going on. Need to remember your ""turns"". Avoid any mistakes because to locate them will be futile. I made sure to look for any errata for this book and there are some. So if you using it, and having problems it is because of an error. It would be wonderful if they would have a video tutorial for the stitches. It would help immensely."
1,Errata errata errata!,I think this book is beautiful and has patterns I am anxious to try. Somehow I stumbled onto the artyarns web site and discovered that there are published erratas (corrections) for 19 of the projects. I even found an error in one of the erratas! I did find that many of the corrections were made before my book was printed but I had to check all 19 projects and compare them to the errata to be sure. Maddeningly irritating.
1,horrible,this is sooooooooooooooo stuipid... I`m tellinf you right now if you get it you`ll regret it.
4,Great,"Good, great, my kids really enjoy watching any of the Whats In The Bible videos that have been made. Highly recommend them to anyone of any age!"
1,Poorly Engineered,"The manufacturers of this toy never should have released it for sale. As noted by other reviewers, the Batman car does not operate properly. It is the wrong shape for maintaining contact with the track, and either does not move at all or is knocked out of its track slot by the Joker cycle as it whizzes by. Given that the Joker cycle moves quickly and stays on the track, there is no point in racing the two vehicles. If your child is content to watch the Joker cycle go around and around the track by itself, then the toy may hold his/her attention for about 10 minutes. That works out to $2/minute to keep your child entertained. Still interested?"
5,The Best!,"I agree with the first reviewer. I think that ""The Chieftains 5"" was the apex of their performance of traditional Irish music. And I would rank ""The Cheiftains 4"" as their penultimate performance. I haven't cared for the more commercial cooperations with other artists.The Chieftains are TERRIFIC!"
4,Gary Oldman's directorial masterpiece,This film is very entertaining. And I loved it. Though if you are at all sensative to foul language or violence than I would stay clear of this one. It is a very intense ride of a film.
5,"Riveting, Explosive and Real !!!!","I found the acting very comfortable to the actors, they really got inside of the characters to make you feel the pain and auguish of a family caught in the life of poverty and drug addition. These are too lows that if put to the screen as powerfully and explict as Oldman did can give you a chill and reality check. The camera shots were done very close-up to give you the feeling that you were right there in the mist of things!! I can't wait for the next project by Oldman to begin! There was one major thing for me is I wish that there were subtitles because I found it hard to follow the dialog."
3,Fair business card case,"I was looking for a business card case and this seems to fit the bill. Prior to this one, I had owned an aluminum one that bent to easily in my pocket. Needless to say, it was ergonomically contoured to my arse. 8) In looking at this case, it may have the same issues if I continue to carry it in my back pocket as well. IMHO, it's not anything to cheer over but it gets the job done. The ""carbon fiber"" finish appears to be more or less a decorative decal and not integrated into the actual case. - Aloha"
3,good game - too easy,"This is a great game, cool graphics and weapons. It was way to easy to beat, your spoon fed the game, every bad guy can be beat by running around him, they are all slow and stand there and let you hit them and then swing at the air - i wish there had been a difficulty setting."
1,Not worth the time or effort,"This was entertaining--briefly. Dress-up was kind of fun, in other words. But let's be honest with ourselves here--this is a terrible, terrible game. Boring, incoherent, and repetitive. Don't do it."
3,trip 'n chill,"This music is not likely to change your life, but that's ok. It's fun and lively and mellow all at the same time... elements of dance/electronica with decent pop hooks. If you like Zero 7, Everything But the Girl, and Portishead this is a good one for your 5 disc CD-changer on a Friday evening, cocktail in hand, incense burning, enjoying a special someone. Chill and relax.Special bonus on the domestic version are remixes of ""I'll Be There"" and ""Into the Sun."""
4,PURSUIT FOR PLEASURE,"The music on this debut album from Groove Armada's Andy Cato and singer Rachel Foster brings to memory a lost album of MPEOPLE, Everything But the Girl or a SADE electronica album never made. It's soft, hard, dance & chill-out oriented and like the group name tells you... WEEKEND PLAYERS is in fact a Weekend cd that you would care to listen after a long days work, a frantic night out at the club or to sit back, relax and enjoy the beats."
5,Very cool music....,"I just listened to this fantastic and amazing and can't wait to play it again in my car. The songs are hypnotic and really do seem to carry you away. Every song on this cd is great and that is rare for an artist. I'll be there, Best Days of our lives, 21st century and other are some of the best. Mostly trance like and danceable beats with a couple slower and mellower songs like Higher Ground and Subway. It's a little different sound than the typical dance that is currently out there but a great investment if you like this kind of music. I recommend it highly!!!!"
4,Excelente yo-yo compadre!!!,"El yo-yo esta muy bueno, le cambie la cuerda por una mas delgada y rueda muchisimo mejor recomendado 100% para jugadores amateurs y de mayor nivel!!!, saludos desde Caracas, Venezuela"
5,Lots of fun,"This is a great yoyo. Its versatile, you can do the freehand style or the standard tie it to your finger style. I actually got mine from doodadsweb.com. If you are looking for a durable, long life yoyo that will grow with ya, you can't go wrong with this one."
2,Not adequate as a sole source of information for the exam,"The Sun examination is much trickier than the sample examinations in this book. I dutifully read the book and took the tests at the end of each chapter. Today, I took the author's practice examination and got a 96%. Great, I'm ready. I then went and took the Sun examination and got 69%. These authors have stung me twice; I had the same experience with their Java 1.1 book. This book is worse; it has numerous typos, and even the chapter numbering has errors in the answer section. My big complaint is that they do not provide you an accurate feeling of the Sun exam, but make you think they did. One of the authors claims to have authored the Sun exam; I wish he'd made some effort to illustrate how ""nuanced"" it is in this book. Caution: do not use this book as the sole preparation for the exam."
5,Excellent book to get Java Certification.,"The book does full justice to it's objective ie. ""Helps you to clear the exam"". It's a very focussed book based on the objectives of Exam. But you must read any good Java book prior to reading this book & have a general understanding of Java Programming.This book also clarified some concepts which I was not sure of.This is a must buy book for all certification aspirants."
4,Good Book,"Overall it's a good book for certification.In chapter 8, methods of Math class is messed up (particularly floor and ceil) and, all related questions in the given bonus questions.In addition to the chapter exercises, there are 200 additional good questions. But, quite a few questions are not relevant for 1.4 programmer's exam(questions related to awt and swing etc.).It's a good book for Developers Exam."
2,Very narrow coverage,"The book is useless for anything other than a basic test preparation - information is limited to ""deliver and forger"" concept. It cannot be used as a reference or a manual. It makes more sense to buy a good manual like The Complete Reference and to use vast Web resources for test samples."
5,A must for all Java Beginners,The day I started reading this book - I knew that this book is going to make my task very easy. And this should be true for all who have used this book. Infact I would say that even if you are not planning to take the certification exam but just starting to learn Java - this is the book which you must have.
4,Excellent Book,"This book is very much focused for J2 ceritification exam, as per title. I liked its content on AWT, thread, multithreading, flowcontrol and exception from the examination point of view. Questions and answers are excellent. However, this book provide inadeqate knowledge on language fundamentals and operator assignment, Java.util and inner classes. I would suggest Java Language Specification book on these topics. But, if any one is preparing for Java 2 programmer certification exam , i would say, this is must read book ."
2,Don't use this book alone. Consider yourself warned.,I used this book exclusivly because of the excellent reviews the previous 1.1 book recieved. The material is presented in a clear way and it is a pretty good starting place for studing for the exam. It's a fair book but does not live up to the high marks it is getting here. The test engine is very misleading with simple questions recycled from the chapter questions. Taking the exam in the test engine will give you a false sense of security that you will pass the real test. Don't be fooled! The test is much harder than this book will lead you to believe. As already noted by other comments here there are items on the test which the book specifically says are not on the test. I would almost consider that to be malpractice. I strongly urge anyone taking the certification exam who insists on buying this book to use other study materials for a complete picture of what to expect on the exam.
4,"good, comprehensive but too verbose","i based my study on it and passed SCJP 2 exam with a score of 92%Be warned though, Practice is the keyword. If you read the book and practice every point, You'll do as i did in SCJP. However, i doubt its content for the SCJD (it doesnt have links to sites/references that one needs in SCJD)."
3,OK Java 2 Programmer Cert review book,"This book was helpful for passing the Java 2 Programmer Certification exam, but it is definately not an all inclusive look at the exam. This book is a good compliment to Bill Brodgens Java 2 Exam Cram book, reading both will put you in good position to do well on the test. The large page count of the book is due to a wateful reprint of all the class heirarchies which was basically useless. The Developer Exam review in the second part of the book is not nearly as intensive as the Programmer review and you will definately need outside material to pass the second exam. Good Luck!"
3,IT IS OK....,You can buy this book and study from it. I don't know why I got the book but then when I read it....I felt rejuvenated and felt like doing yoga.......
3,should be more updated,"The new edition is for 1.4 exam released this month. Although parts of the book have been updated, for example, the new exam objectives and new section on Assertion, the book still need some update. The awt and io packages have been removed from 1.4 exam. However, the practice exams still have questions on these topics. Also, the io chapter should be moved to the Developer Test section.It seems that the authors focus more on the Developer test since most of the Programmer Test chapters are essentially the same as previous edition.One nice point about this edition is the added questions on the CD-Rom for programmer's test."
4,Oh there are even faster ways to quit applications...,"I finally found out the other day.... you bring up the ""keyboard"" and click on CTRL-Q... that quits the majority of applications instantly... it's made my 125 a pleasure to use instead of a dragging slow bore.... now, if it'd just come with some decent documentation... :-)"
1,A Poor Tribute,"This may have some novelty value for devoted Garbage fans, but the string arrangements are very unimaginative. They sound like backing tracks rather than independent works. Granted, Garbage's songs may not lend themselves to such arrangements, but a more imaginative arranger could have done better."
5,The Way West/Escort West/Chato's Land,"This collection is just like buying the movies on DVD through MGM. All three of these movies are in Widescreen and the picture is really great. There isn't a menu, except the three choices for the movie in which it just takes you to the start of the movie. Overall if you don't already have these films, I would recommend this set.The Way West (122mins/color/1967):Kirk Douglas, Robert Mitchum & Richard WidmarkDirector: Andrew V. McLaglenEscort West (75mins/BW/1959):Victor Mature & Elaine StewartDirector: Francis D. LyonChato's Land (100mins/color/1972):Charles Bronson, Jack Palance, Richard Basehart & James WhitmoreDirector: Michael Winner"
5,Please understand: THIS IS A CLASSIC,"I can't believe many customers / readers rate: 3 stars because ""it is outdated"". We shouldn't even consider to update this masterpiece, they may also want to add some notes to Beethoven's 9th Symphony!Excellent book, must read for anyone interested in urbanism. A classic."
3,250 tc sheets,"I received these sheets very quickly but they're a bit on the rough side. I have, however, only washed them once so far. Maybe they'll soften up with time. The color is great!"
2,LOVE IT/HATE IT,"Philips Senseo Coffeemaker - RedMy daughter got the Senseo for me. I love the coffeemaker. The right there when you need it is great. How ever, I find the coffee selection is not that great, at the store or online. Why don't they have unique blends like Peppermint, pumpkin,(seasonal blends), or Chocolate coffee, rasberry (I'm leaning toward the Millstone blends here)? And where is the selection of teas and hot chocos? I find that the Keurig has a larger selection of all kinds. Wish I had ask for that one instead as I don't see Senseo going as far in selection as Keurig has. Really too bad."
1,Dissapointed in Sony!,"I am dissapointed in Sony! Usually you can't go wrong. However,the drive just doesn't do what it claims. It will not write fasterthan 8x when burning files and 4x when going from CD toCD. Bufferunderruns are the norm and not the exception. When it didrun it was real noisy. I tried callingSony.................................................I waited longerthan this, and they hung up on me after 35 minutes waiting to talkwith them. This happened three times. That was enough. You have tostand behind your product..."
5,Bossa Nova is Where It's At!!!!,"I had loved Bossa Nova for years, as it was introduced to the States by Byrd and Getz and Jobim, but wasn't aware of how much great NEW bossa nova was out there. Thanks to Amazon reviewers, I was directed to Six Degrees recordings, the best thing happening in music right now. This CD is so smooth that you find yourself singing along, even though you don't know any Portugese. Subtle electronic touches make it sound both traditional and modern, a tough edge to walk. Needless to say, I have checked out the remix CD of these wonderful songs, and there are some great companions on that CD too. Like others, I am dying to hear Bebel's new album (hopefully in 2003?!). Till then, I will do my best to wear out a CD!!"
4,a new gilberto,"This album takes one back to the beautiful bossa days of old, with just a touch of electronic updating to give it a modern feel. Bebel's voice even sounds a lot like namesake Astrud Gilberto's. Hushed instrumentation is the perfect companion to Bebel's silky smooth voice. Perfect for a late night cocktail under muted lamps."
2,Showtunes in June....,"I originally was attracted to Bebel Giberto because of her voice & the main reason beacause of the track ""August Day""(THE KING BRITT REMIX). If you have'nt heard it, its banana's(I love it). I can't say that Bebel is my favorite artist but I do enjoy some of her songs. The rest of her songs put me to sleep,but someone must enjoy them beacause she has 4 freakin album thus far. If she had more songs like August Day Song & Aganju',she would have a big fan in me."
1,overproduced electronic besmirchal of bossa nova,"This is truly only of the most horrible CDs to come out of Brasil. Unfortunately, it is representative of a growing movement within Brasil (and the world) to merge electronic gobbly gook with basically good music to produce a bastardized form of music which only besmirches the original style of music (here, bossa nova). It also reflects an unfortunate movement to forget one's own language and sing in English as well. Brazilian Portuguese is probably the most beautiful musical language on the planet. English on the other hand is not musical at all and only grates on one's ears when sung. The only song worthy of a positive comment is Banareira. Record this song and forget the rest of this CD."
3,Substandard,"Okay, first off, I did not dislike this book. It's hard to find quality sci-fi, and while this book doesn't achieve le guin's usual standards of writing, I enjoyed it. However, The Telling is very introspective and philisophocal, and also very straightforwardly so. It contains none of the grandly complex metaphors that characterize the high end of the genre but rather resorts to internal and explanatory monolougues. There is little to no character devlopment outside of the first person pov of the protagonist, in fact the entire thing is pretty darn short.All I ask is please, please don't judge le guin by this novel. I can forgive her it and many more (though I hope I won't have to) just by rereading The Left Hand of Darkness or her Earthsea novels."
1,Typical Romanist Attack of Christianity,"Mr. Joel Peters book ""Scripture Alone?: 21 Reasons to Reject Sola Scriptura"" would be closer to the truth if it were titled ""Twenty-one Ways Romanists Attack Biblical Christianity"" or something to that effect. Because this book is at it's heart just an attack of Biblical Christianity.Soli Deo Gloria!"
2,"good blender, bad mixer","I really like the blender, although it isn't recommended to be placed in the dishwasher, which is annoying. The other flaw is that it doesn't get much smaller toward the bottom so you can't mix small amounts as well. The mixer can't handle heavy bread doughs at high speeds. The whole thing shakes and doesn't ""knead"" well. The other aspect of the mixer that drives me crazy is the blending aparatus in the center of the bowl. You can't lift it up and out and you have to work around it and scrape around it. You also have to be careful when you add ingredients so that it doesn't land on the top of the middle, where it won't get incorporated. This is a major design flaw in my opinion, and the reason I won't be buying another."
3,Funny in places,"The Bone Man of Benares is pretty much one man's obsession with a specific woman and drugs in the 1970's. This book should be subtitled taking drugs in exotic places. While he can be extremely funny at times, most of the book reads like an over-obsessed childhood crush on drugs. It isn't until the author gets to Africa that you get any indication of the society around him (other than the drug taking that is). All the way to the end of the book you get endless lessons on Bangi, hash-smoking and acid-taking. While I understand this was a major part of the era it seems to be mentioned a little too often and makes you wonder just exactly how much of the other stuff he describes really happened or if it was all just a bad acid trip."
4,Read this review before purchasing the hat!!!!,We purchased this straw hat for my 5 year old son's class party. It is great for the purpose but I paid twice as more for the shipping than the hat. So I am pretty disappointed. Amazon said oh well. Good business??? I should not have been so lazy and I should of gone to a store around me. It would of cost me alot less. I spent 23.00 this way on Amazon.
3,there is truth in advertising,"as the sticker reads on the CDs front, ""If you like the Basement Jaxx and Daft Punk, you'll love Mutiny UK!"" They speak true, although i would've left the Daft Punk part off. Very much on the same path as the Jaxx, this CD more rigidly follows the path than does there counterparts (who seem more prone to stray a little farther towards either side of the musical spectrum). If it was possible i would've given this 3.5 instead of 3. the album seems to divide its time between some great filtered, quirky house tracks and lush (""Kip Da Kik Bouncin'""), vocal-laden beats (""Doin' Me Right""). A solid outing with some great instrumentation and programming, and it would definitely get some bodies movin' on the dancefloor."
1,This game sucks bad,"I had a lot of high expectations for what to expect when the PS2 first came out. This was one of the first games I had bought with the console. It is by far the worst game I own. The characters move slow the dialog does not match with the characters mouth or motions. It obviously was intended to be used on a PC platform and Agetec rushed it out for the PS2. The puzzles are simple the game is slow and the character and the controls are clumsy. This game is a big mistake, I will not buy any other games from Agetec until I know for certain that it is a good game."
4,Can someone answer a question?,"Can someone tell me if the episode with harry anderson who plays the artist with the drawings that he makes come to life is in this set?--I noticed from another review that one of the cast within the set is in fact harry anderson, though I'm just not sure this particular episode is in there."
4,NoNonsense Man's Guide to Women on Planet Earth,Interesting quick read. Exactly what you would expect from Marc Rudov. Some useful and insightful material and checklist. A nice simplified way to categorize the women of the world. If only it were all that simple and disconnected. A useful resource and should be basic reading for every young boy.
5,Made Of Metal Not Plastic,Once again Amazon had a product no one else had and it is a perfect fit. The Crossarm is made of metal and it came with two gold end caps. My one one lasted 15 years before it rotted away. Great price and delivery.
4,Motorola Phone Software & Accessories,"I recently received a Motorola phone that came with a wall charger but nothing else. My real desire was to customize the LCD screen and the ringtones. The software package that came with this package was just the right product. It is fairly intuitive and I was able to load both an image to the LCD screen and a ring tone from my computer using the provided USB cable. For me the other accessories were a bonus. The belt clip case is hard plastic, but rotates 180 degrees so you can have the phone parallel to your belt. This is a great feature when your sitting or driving and keeps the phone from poking your leg or ribs. The value for me was well worth the $10 price. Before buying this I downloaded some software for $7 that I never did get to work. And I also joined the Motorola programmers site to try and accomplish the same thing that this software did. Overall great value and great experience."
3,Seat Cushion Hurts Your Seat,"I had a homedic full length heating/massage pad and the motors wore out after 1 year, so I thought I'd try this one by Dr. Scholl. The heat goes from mild to very warm, but very slowly, and if an elderly person uses it, they have to be sure to be well clothed and use a blanket over it or it can harm the skin. It just gets too hot. Then there's the motors for the massage, placed right under your butt cheeks. It's therefore lumpy and uncomfortable. But it works as stated and the massage reaches the upper back, which was important for me. If I had to do it again, I would buy one after more research and after trying them out in a store first, to match the placement of the motors with my body better."
2,Heat,The heater does not work very will. If you are buying it for the heating pad I would not waiste your time or money.
5,GREAT DEATH METAL!,Alright I'm not gonna waste your time by going into all the nitty gritty so I'm just going to say if you like heavy Death Metal with very deep and brutal vocals then buy this immediately.
4,Found it!,"I read this book in 3rd grade. In fact, I had the book out of our class library all year - I kept renewing it over and over. 45 years later I decided to look for it to read it again and am delighted to find used copies listed here. I've added it to my Wish List. It's nice to see how popular it was."
5,Engrossing,"I had read the previous volume 2 of the life of Mahler several years ago and had anxiously awaited the issuance of this, the third in a four part series with high expectations.I have not been disappointed. The extensive detail, expansive footnoting, and thorough research that went into this work is evident from the very first paragraph.Highly recommended for any serious Mahler enthuasist."
5,Brilliant - Heartwarming,"I saw this movie in IMAX 3D a few months ago and was truly inspired. So much so that we are no longer giving our friends gifts for special occasions, we are adopting baby elephants and orangutans on their behalf - what a great gift! So happy this is out on DVD - you'll love it!"
2,not Happy with 3D on this DVD,Very educational but the 3d will give you a headache. Some good spots but most of the close up shots come across blury and hurt the eyes. My wife and son asked that I turn it off or use 2D.Transformers on 3D is a different story. The whole movie was excellent 3D and I never had to pause it. I have seen several 3D movies so it's not my TV.
3,"1 good movie, 2 bad","The price on this collection isn't bad. Still, the first predator movie is the only one of these that is good - the other two are garbage. My advice is you're better off investing in a blu-ray version ofPredator [Blu-ray] than getting this set."
1,NOT chemically free,"When I buy something that says ""chemical free"" I expect it to be that. It did contain chemicals. Since I am very sensitive to chemicals I felt betrayed."
1,"""Easter"" is in the Title, but the word ""Easter"" isn't in the book","Surely you remember going on egg hunts as a child...What? You say you went on ""Easter"" egg hunts, but never an ""egg hunt?""Sorry, but the PC police have arrived, deleting any reference to a Christian religious holiday.It is absurd, ridiculous, and offensive to delete the reference to this holiday...especially with the false use of the word in the title (after all, one would think that one would learn a bit about Dora's ""EASTER"" basket).Strange that this publisher doesn't seem to have a problem with using other holidays in the actual bodies of other Dora books, hmmmm?That said, our 4-year old loves it, with Daddy constantly adding the word ""Easter."" There is educational value to this book, on more levels than our child realizes, unfortunately."
5,Completely Satisfied,"I've been using this lens for about 2 months now and I am completely satisfied. I use it for everyday photos, wildlife shots, close ups and anything in between. It delivers crisp photos though out. Remarkable performance and the price can't be beat!"
4,The beginning of an easy to read history of Britain and Amer,Winston Churchill wrote history as it probably ought to be written - it's readable!
2,This Book Is Thin In More Ways Than One,"This book delivers little of the promise of the title and I'm quite surprised by the Mountain Astrologer comment above. The book really is about astrology. There is a little bit of Greek and Roman mythology thrown in, but only as it relates to the constellations of the zodiac. If you already knew or thought that Virgo was based on Ceres or Isis then you won't learn a lot here. In short this is a book about astrology for someone new to the subject. It also has a number of glaring errors or, at best, places where the author presents new opinions as accepted fact.I liked the title, but now feel misled by it."
3,Where reality and fantasy come together...,"I bought this film without knowing anything about it, I got it for 2.99 and saw that it could be a good horror. 'Fade to black' is a sort of tragedy but not so much a horror, more a cult thriller? drama? anyway it's decent all the same. One for the film buffs!"
2,faded...,"...cuz this show is veird, ill, retarted, kinda borin movie especially via silly antics used visually; this was a better movie 1st seen when it 1st came out-das all i can say."
1,Get the HBO Special Instead!,"This DVD is almost the exact same routine that Katt did on his HBO special Pimp Chronicles, Part I. The biggest difference is the overall production quality of this show. The film is dark and is filmed at awkward distances that often make it difficult to even see him or get close-ups of his facial expressions, which are a big part of his comedy. The jokes are almost identical to the ones he did on his HBO special. I would recommend buying the HBO special for your collection and filing this one on your ""don't buy"" list."
5,Kat is the greatest,"Katt williams is the most funniest comic today, this edition is like the breakthrough for his stand up comedy, he reminds me of the ole red foxx, richard pryor days, with his raw stand-up, dont hold any punches comedy, great dvd, great purchase"
4,Katt Williams: Live,I had a ticket to see Katt Williams perform. I had never heard any of his work so this dvd gave me an opportunity to get a flavor for his work. The dvd was very good.
4,Leave your hypocrisy at the door,"If you are going to be offended and not enjoy a little humor, please don't buy this. On the other hand, if you enjoy good humor and some laughs, get this DVD. Enjoyed the show and hope that this is not all from this talented comedian."
3,It was OK.,"The case was a different brand (Kroo) not Koan. Case did not looked as advertised. Charger was a no frill, cheap looking. It looked as something bought in a 99 cent store. Case do serve a purpose. Would not trust MP3 with charger."
2,Not an oil...,"I ordered this oil to flavor my homemade lip balm. Smelled and tasted great... BUT did not mix with my balm. Sense this product is NOT an oil and is water based it wont, unless I'm missing something."
1,Disappointed!,Pulls hair! I used to have one many years back and it seems like the old one (which was pretty banged up) worked better than the new one!
3,schooling,The book was ok. Nothing I would ever buy for personal reading obviously but it got the job done for my classes.
3,Anyone want to investigate this???,"If true, then like all the others here, I give it 5-stars. If it is nothing more than a tall-tale, it gets only 1-star (It is not a great piece of prose in and of itself, and decent ghost writers are a dime a dozen.) I too would love to see more verification, but the trail must be cold (excuse the pun) after all these years. Oh well....."
3,Want to buy a bridge?,This story is unbelievable but entertaining. One's incredulity was stretched by their journey and subsequently exceeded with the sighting of the abdomitable snowmen at the end. The fact that the survivors never stayed in touch also detracts. A swim across the Indian Ocean was the only unbelievable element left out. He would have been a great salesman.
5,There's always a catch,"This was a great gift and the recipient loved it! However, he also did some research on it. While it may be a great story, it is completely false. I was very disappointed as it is advertised and sold as a true story. Guess I should have done my research like he did though BEFORE it was purchased. Oh well...entertaining for sure."
5,Truly a story of survival on the way to find freedom.,I have read this book twice and the story of what Slavomir Rawicz and his companions was able to accomplish still astounds me. The lengths they went to find freedom are a lesson that applies in any age. Its a remarkable story of their journey I enjoyed it as much now as I did 30 years ago.
2,The Long Walk,"Not a bad read, although the plot becomes bogged down with the sheer boredom of this journey.Page after page of searching for food and walking. It is hard to belive that these men managed their way throught this almost inconceiveable journey on the goodness of the Mongolinan and Tibetan people.This novel does not impart upon the reader adequately thru written prose, the actual hardships that would have been commensurate of this type of journey. Nor does it impart any survial techniques required to keep people alive on a several thousand mile journey.In closing, I find it basically uninspiring and hard to belive. Wouldn't even make a good fiction novel. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
4,long walk review,A gripping tale and true page turner hard to put down. The author is atalented wordsmith. Though I accidentally came upon this find it has beenterrific and is highly recommended.The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom: Movie Tie-InC
1,Not a good read,"Singularly one of the worst fact-checked books I have EVER read. This book has been hailed as a true story, but in reality, the man NEVER made the trek he describes. The writing is poor, the story-line, had it been presented as fiction MIGHT have been interesting, if only the writing wasn't so, so uninspired. I read this for a book club and was NOT impressed. Not in the least. Google the ""authors"" name. Read the documents. But DO NOT buy this book and read it. Again, the story-line, presented as fiction, might make a good movie and that is what Hollywood is counting on. In one word, annoying. Don't waste your time or your money."
4,Gritty story!,"People forget how the Russian's treated their suspected political enemies, great reminder. Wonderful example of the human need to be free!"
2,2nd rate movie,"After reading the Book, I was anxious to see the movie. The casting was not very good, and the movie did not have the same kind of excitment the book had. If I had not read the book I would not have known what was going on in the movie. The product from my kindle however is what amazon was responsible for and the delivery was seemless. Never have problems with the downloading. Not amazon nor Kindles fault, but it was not a very good movie."
1,TRUTH OR FANTASIES?,"It's amazing how the author was able to remember exact quotes thirty years after the fact. Maybe he had a tape recorder. Oh, and the party of escapees crossed the Lena River. Just crossed it, period. No mention of the river's size or the temperature or how they managed to overcome little inconveniences like hypothermia. Did they wade or use a raft? The author leaves out some other critical points, like walking across the Gobi desert without water. Pretty determined group! Use your time in another way."
2,What a fairy tale!,"If this had been written simply as a novel I could have enjoyed it more. Unfortunately, everything was entirely too fantastic to be believed. I think the con artist who wrote this book found a quick way to gain some attention and a few dollars to pad his wallet. And the character, Mr. Smith! Give me a break. Knowing the readership would be mainly English-speaking, he chose a name impossible to trace. Back up the book with some facts and I will gladly change my opinion."
5,A Must Have for any Woodworker,"I like these clamps. They get the job done, are easy to use, and come in different sizes. I bought a second set after using these. Would recommend this set."
4,Otter Pops,"Great for nostalgic reasons. We bought them cause just seeing the box brings back so many memories. The flavors are just the same as anything you can buy at the store today with a cheaper pricetag. They are also very small compared to todays store bought brands....but for nostalgic reasons, we still love them."
5,Fabulous as usual!,"As far as I am concerned, Cecila Bartoli can do no wrong. I have been a singer myself and have studied the art of singing all my life (75years). She has no eguals. The fioritura, the phrasing, the feeling levels are all so appropriate."
2,You get what you pay for,I've had this saw for 1 year now. So far I found it helpful. I guess the real stress test came when building a deck out of composite lumber. After trimming off boards I noticed that the composite lumber saw dust clogged up the saw and the blade got literally stuck. After this incident I noticed that I can not make 90 degree cut any longer (which is extremely annoying).I am now looking for another saw that is a) more powerful (15Amps) and b) that cuts 90 degrees.
1,Junk,"I had to get a saw and my wife came back with this piece of junk.It will cut a plank in half, but should you need the cut to be 90 deg, forget it.Dont adjust the angle just bend the base back to 90 deg, it will bend out of true again, so why bother. Just throw it away. Junk.Thank you B and D for your waste of resources."
1,Innaccurate,"The saw is inaccurately calibrated, I mean WAY off, making it useless for cutting angles or any kind of precise woodworking. You can't fix it, either. I use this saw for cutting firewood, it's all it's good for."
5,Truly a workhorse,"Very impressed with the sturdiness of this stand, especially for the price. Rated at 250#, it feels like it can handle it without a problem. Very prompt delivery from Amazon. Don't see how they make any money on this with free shipping."
2,Unimpressed,"Having read Dale Carnegie's work, which this book references, I expected something more. I was disappointed. The book attempts to recast a small subset of Carnegie's principles for a younger audience, but doesn't do a very good job of it."
1,Not Helpful,"When I read the first few parts of the book, I thought it would be very helpful. But I was wrong. First off, its very undetailed and doesn't explain much about the process of making friends. Also, its unrealistic, especially for middle schoolers. I say this because they make it sound like: Compliment a person and they'll be your friend. Or: Smile and they will like you. I don't think thats very helpful. It might be okay for very young kids starting one of the lower grades, but definetly not middle schoolers or even some elementary schoolers."
1,displeased,do NOT buy this item to use in the microwave!!! the lid rim splintered and left shards ranging from 1/4 inch to two inches of length in the food (I have not even had it a month yet); I was replacing old lids which lasted MUCH longer -- the original product carton specifies a 2 year warranty on the lids
5,Cheerful Mayhem Neo-Noir,"Williams' collection of Quinn stories falls somewhere short of Andrew Vachss' Burke and somewhere ahead of Parker's Spenser (for hire). Williams loves writing in ""first person sarcastic"" and keeps the tradition for American trouble-shooters having a wise-ass crack for everything alive and well. There's an interesting undercurrent in these stories, a kind of cheerfully sociopathic bent, that makes them a great guilty pleasure. If you like your crime stories terse with punches and gunshots, check this book out!"
1,The book sucks,"The book does not flow from creating a project to finishing a project. It is haphazard. The examples from the website suck! None of the examples are complete, especially chapter 12 which is the one I wanted the most."
4,Sweep 10: Seeker! Oooh Hunter you bad boy!,"This book is written from Hunter's point of view. It was quite interesting hearing his thoughts on things, especially on Morgan (his thoughts about her were very ""teenagerish"" LoL) So Hunter travels to Canada to find his mother and father who he hasn't seen for 11 years. When he gets there he finds his mother is dead and his father is not the man he once was. While there he gets an assignment from the council about a female witch named Justine Courecou who is collecting a list of true names (ooo that's a major Wiccan no-no!)At the end of this book I was soo [ANGRY]. I wanted to grab Hunter and his dad and hit them with a few bricks! And then hit them again. Ugh! Still a good book though despite the murderous thoughts from me towards Hunter and his da."
4,durablity 0 fun fun FUN great!,"If you want to ""teach"" your children the George Lucas religious value of ""morals"" this is your guy. Yet I fail to see how good couldn't get caught up in this mess too. The Episode II character is very flimsy and if you use the mechanism for duel wielding his hand not only ""comes off"" so does the hilt of his sword. Vader is cool, good likeness to young Anakin (scarred) instead of Old Anakin.(scarred and played by Sebastian Shaw.) in return of the Jedi. The other is Episode three Anakin ""Darth Vader"" Skywalker post his corruption with Emperor Palpatine. Pryor his dark armour ""gift"". It would be interesting to have this and Mace Windu and The Emperor as well as the ""lucky"" devil who ""escaped"", mister sandmaster himself, Obi Wan Kenobi, to complete the pivotal package. Though the picture show(Lucas artsy-fartzty movie) was terrible, this is an interesting tale. Though ""good"" is sometimes ""unethically preachie""."
4,A bit hard to adjust but good overall,"I had to adjust it for a closer spacing saw blade. I was a little time consuming but it is something you only do once. The worst part about the whole thing is it is packed in so much grease. It is typical Grizzly in the way that it is made, slightly crude and over-built but very functional. If you plan to do any mortise and tenon joints it is the way to go. Overall it is well worth the price."
5,tenoning cabinets,"the only thing is a rough casting on the bottom plate,scratches saw table& the same plate has corrosion under paint,so the paint is coming off.both an easy fix. 5 T ****** for how well it works. made this old seabee proud. fair price ,used on 1 set of cabinets. cost less than others. ease of use ***"
4,"I like it, but....","Fast shipping and great price. However, this jig took a lot of ""jiggling"" to get it to work properly. I had to drill out one of the holes in the base plate to get enough play in the miter slot bar to properly align the jig to the blade. The instructions, as others noted, are in bad need of rewriting. They are not very accurate. In fact, the product is sold as usable for a right/left tilting saw, but there's not one word about this in the manual. I had to write Grizzly to get a clarification. Apparently, merely moving the miter guide bar to the alternate setting makes this a jig for a left tilting blade saw. Who knew? Once I was done tinkering with it, it is now an accurate, easy to use piece of machinery."
2,John G,The assembly and use manual is a joke. It is full of inaccuracies and lacks needed information. This tool is OK for basic uses only.
2,High pitch hiss during phone conversations,High pitch noise is heard during phone conversations. Tried with two different phones - same result. Otherwise good design.
3,I expected a little better,"For the great reviews I saw for this, I expected better. It is small and fits well, but it has a buzz on my end when I'm on the phone. I can't figure out why, maybe someone knows. Also, the volume even on highest setting isn't very high.All in all it was fair and not what I expected, but I'll chalk that up to lesson learned."
4,A Great Strategy Guide,"This is a great guide. It has a compleat walkthrough of Tiberian Sun and Firestorm. The missons stategies help alot, plus they are perfect when you get stuck. The stategies for multiplayer are excellent. It got a 4 star rating because the walkthrough of the Tiberian Sun Missons are identical to the first guide."
4,Very unique nightstand,I bought two of these for my Japanese inspired bedroom. They fit the decor and look beautiful. We ended up trying about five different lightbulbs in them before settling on a soft light low wattage bulb. The lighting in the room is very nice. You can see the lightbulb through the paper but it's not too distracting. The rosewood color was more reddish than I expected from the pictures. Overall I'm very satisfied.
2,"the Megaman NT Warrior 5"" Figure: Protoman","though this is not a bad action figure, it could be much better. the design is not very strong and a i have seen such figure break some what easily. i recommend buying this item for someone 10 or older. at least then they will hopefully be gentler with it. the battle chip that comes with this item is number 49: widesword and works wirth another toy, the advanced personal terminal."
2,A Decent Review,"(...) I will say that this toy is, at best, meant only for decoration. It's design is so fragile and flat, the hair, like the Megaman X: Zero figure of this same build type, is annoying. These figures are scrawny and boring, it even demeans the television show. The limbs and joints are either stuck or too loose, you'll quickly grow tired, unless you have Shaman King actions figures to disembowel these figures."
1,The Grafter's Handbook.,No rating because I did not receive what I thought I'd ordered. What I received was the 1967 version with the green cover; not the latest edition of this book. How do I return this one and get the right copy?
3,No Massage Techniques Included,"I'm a massage therapist and found this book to be a helpful resource in a number of areas (detailed below), but was disappointed that it didn't include any pregnancy massage techniques. (Instead, the author simply suggests using the same massage strokes used for other clients.) The author is a midwife, and the book is written from this perspective, rather than that of a massage therapist. That said, I found this book to be a good reference on the anatomy of pregnancy, the mother-to-be's experience through each trimester, safety precautions for massage, and some comfort tips to address symptoms such as headaches & nausea (for the mother to use at home.) This book is an excellent pregnancy education resource, rather than a pregnancy massage instruction manual."
3,Too many typos,"I wish that the editors did their job before this wonderful book was released. I'm not even into the second chapter yet and on almost every other page I have noticed typos, misprints, and large mistakes that you just can't igonre. PLEASE FIX THIS WHOEVER YOU ARE THAT FIXES THESE ISSUES!!! Thank you. OTHERWISE, it's a great read (for massage therapists)."
1,TERRIBLE EDITING!,"I guess I shouldn't give this book only one star. It could be a great book. However, I couldn't read the book as I can't overlook the terrible editing!!! Page v: ""for all the ""midnights"" he was there by my side"" (may be picky, but why is midnights in "" "" ???) Page vii: ""Dieter's lack patience."" Overuse of the "". . . "" and if you are going to overuse it, type it right!Perhaps it is a good book. I'm sorry, but if you're going to charge $19 for a book, the least you can do is make sure you can use an apostrophe right!!!"
4,It's Ink,"What can I say? It's ink... It works.I did buy this refurbished, there was an issue with availability and the company contacted me immediately, fixed the issue, and promptly send out my ink. Great service. I believe the company name is: schoolcartridgereplacement.com you'll know it if you see it on the amazon page of other sellers.They have a great offer for replacement cartridges where they will donate $2.00 to the school of your choice when you use their mail-in replacement program. Check them out."
1,Change sensor way too early,"I use my printer mostly for receiving fax. The change cartridge sensor, I'm told is in the cartridge, indicates a critical shortage and stops after every batch. It asks if the quality was OK & to enter the number 1 if it is. This is supposed to be the notice to change the cartridge. What a pain! I get at least 450 more copies after this but have to baby sit the printer for every fax. It would be fine if you I could override this sensor but that's not possible. For the price I would expect a better fine tuned sensor than this brand has."
4,Best to get OEM,"I've had a lot of trouble with remanufactured Lexmark cartridges, whether I purchased them online or at a retail store. Either the printer doesn't recognize the cartridge, or they stop working half way through, or the print quality isn't good. Plus, it seems like many of the remanufactured cartridge vendors use a lot of subcontractors, so you can never be sure that you will get the same quality from one purchase to the next. After wasting lots of money, I've found out that the best deal is to get an OEM cartridge from Amazon and recycle it at office supply store to get a few dollars back."
2,lexmark ink compatability,"The cartridges I received were the correct ones for my printer,the only problem I encountered was that after installation the printer showed an error message that the wrong cartridge was installed.After a few tries Ihad to remove the newly replaced ink cartridge with another new one effectively rendering the money spent and saved as being moot. I seriously doubt that I will be using that vendor againThank You,R.E. West"
3,Had to make it fit onto saw - not supposed to happen.,"I was disappointed with this simple replacement chain. Not by it's lack of cutting, but by the fact that it did not fit properly onto the chain blade.Ends up some of the teeth that fit into the groove on the blade were dented and a little too thick to fit.After making sure that my chain blade was not bent - i realized what the problem was and took out my Dremel to grid the teeth even and smooth.It's a small thing - but in my opinion a simple thing like a chain should fit on easily."
3,Author is insulting,"I was happy to find a book about my favorite thing- Christmas lights, and ordered it right away. When I settled down to read it, I didn't like the tone the author took in his writing. Most of his verbal descriptions of the people who like to go the extra mile to beautify their homes for the holidays were offensive. He called them kooky or nuts and belittled their efforts by making everyone sound ""quirky"" or ""obsessive"". It was obvious that he felt that lighting your house in an original way was stupid.I am glad that someone focused an entire book on the beauty of Christmas lights and the talented and clever people who decorate with them, but I wish someone else had written the book! Buy it for the pictures, and ignore the critical text."
1,didn't care for,"I was trying to replace spenda in my diet. This sweetner left me with a nausiating feeling. I didn't return it, but did throw it away. It may have been the concentration of this product, but I couldn't get the right amount right in my coffee or oatmeal"
1,Sweet & Low without the cancer.,"If you like the (bitter) taste of Sweet & Low, get this. If you don't, don't. Couldn't get through one cup of coffee (and I only used 1/2 of the tiny packet).I'm gonna give ""Stevia Extract in the Raw"" a try. It's made by the folks at ""Sugar in the Raw."" (And, no, I don't work for their company.) Here's what they claim:""Stevia Extract In The Raw gets its delicious, natural sweetness from Rebiana (aka Reb-A) -- an extract from the Stevia plant. This extract is the sweetest part of the plant and has recently been isolated to provide pure sweetening power without the licorice-like aftertaste that many of our predecessors exhibited. All you get is the sweet flavor without any calories.""We'll see. Simply-Stevia is simply nasty."
1,Not worth it,"There are much better books for those learning to cook. I was reviewing this to see if any ""How to ook"" cookbooks were actually good at teaching folks how to cook well. It did not at all in my opinion. Folks need to know things that good cooks & chefs take for granted."
4,"Great book series, it covers events nicely.","From a public library standpoint this title is a wonderful research tool. It's format is clear and concise, with lots of colored photographs and graphs. Only one problem : what happened to the coverage for 1994 and 1995? I do plan to purchase more of these as they are published."
5,JVC SR-VS30: The Freelancer's Workhorse Machine,"I was lucky enough to stumble upon a JVC SR-VS30 deck at the local Goodwill and snagged it for an astonishing $24.99. It has worked perfectly with FCP5 on my iMac, and I was familiar with it after using the same model in the edit bays at my college; I've been able to capture miniDV and VHS tapes for myself and clients without any problems. And although SD is well on its way out, I'm definitely keeping the deck for future digitizing purposes. There's always someone who wants an old family vacation transferred to DVD."
4,Great starting point for college students,"Having just finished college, I found this book very useful/helpful in understanding how our country functions. It touches just enough on a wide variety of subjects being careful not to bore you with mundane details. The only flaw was that I read it 3 years after it had been written and many things have changed since Clinton's presidency. Still, I highly suggest it!"
1,Sucky-sucky,"This is a pretty useless product - got it as a present - trust me, just type your email... much easier than this"
4,Enlightening,"Reading this book gave me a great understanding into Steiner education. It was the first Steiner book I read and made me change my whole view on which method to use when homeschooling my kids. It has lots of examples from schools around the world about how children respond to this type of nurturing and caring. It won't tell you how to teach using this approach but it is a great spring board, will spark your mind and give you a little taste of the endless possibilities. It is certainly well worth the read."
4,Works as Expected,"This item was a bit more on cost than I would have liked to have spent, but I will say it works just as I had expected and needed. I'll take one star off because of the high price."
2,Somewhat pointless,"An odd little compilation which takes the Appalachian songs from 1971's Reflection, and adds a few traditional numbers from 1970's Cruel Sister. Which begs the question: er, why? If you're really looking for some prime Pentangle, try the excellent Light Flight collection (2 CDs for less than the price of this one), or track down a copy of Reflection or Basket Of Light."
1,Help Needed !,"Sorry ! I could not read this document. If I was a Kid, I would not have any trouble but I am 72 and not up-to-speed on computers. I ordered this report, paid for it, but where is it ? I can order stuff on the internet. I ordered books from Amazon before, but never a Download. So, I'm gonna try again, but if you can help me, or if you could print the report and mail it to me, that would be great. Tell me how many extra bucks you need for that. Thanks ! Jacques Linder"
3,"the Megaman NT Warrior 5"" Figure: Heatguts","though some of the figures from this new megaman line are kind of lame, this one is a bit better. the parts that come with it are well made (especially the ""guts"" fist). it is not great be any means, if you only buy one figure from the new megaman toy line, this should be it. the battle chip that comes with it is the rare 003: m-cannon and work with another toy, the adavanced personal terminal."
5,Love these puffed cakes! Are the best!,"I am crazy about these kamut cakes. I use them with everything now, With all my various raw nut butters, And any time I need a snack, I've tried them in the spelt too, but I've had better luck with the kamut, the spelt I occasionally hit a hard seed of some sort, But they're good too, The lightly salted seem to taste the best in these, I'm not into the Agave sweetened and the plain were a little blah, I order these by the case and they don't last long, I can assure you, I hope Amazon does everything possible to keep these in stock,"
1,"CLOONEY WOULD MAKE A GREAT ""CORKY""","George Clooney is about as entertaining to watch as Michael Jackson being raped by the Gorton's fisherman. His pompous, self indulgent personality is better suited for being a Walmart greeter. Except he'd probably be fired for only saying hello to himself.Clooney: GET LOST"
3,It was okay,What Happened to Lani Garver was an interesting story but took quite awhile to get to anything interesting. It sadly lost my attention and I was unable to finish it.
2,Boring,i love to read but this book was so hard to get into and i could barely get through it all. not a good book at all.
2,EverQuest Meets Diablo...sorta,"Meet Anna..thats about all there is to say about a game that was originally hyped as great looking 3rd person survival horror game, suddenly turned into a rather dull Diablo rip-off. Character interaction isn't what the reviews claim it to be (oh sure, the villagers talk to you, but its nothing that you need to go out of the way for) and for a game titled Vampire Apocalpyse, it has nothing to do with vampires! For that matter, the endless questing and hacking of monsters (the hack and slash is the ONLY fun part) gets dull after an hour, and there's STILL no hint anywhere of a storyline or even a minor plot! If you need something to do to just occupy some time, get this game, but if you're looking for a good plot/story related action RPG (if you can really call this game an RPG) then I'd try to steer clear of Dark Angel."
1,Gota be kidding me,I would rather play the original Pong or Space Invaders!A great big stinko goes out from me to Metro 3D. Won't be buying anything from these guys.
1,"If I could, I would give it -5 stars","I rented this game from my local John's Video. I brung it home and started playing. I immediatly started fighting. Fighting. That is the only thing you do in this game. No story or plot,no character development, no nothing. I seriously considered sueing the makers for this. After 1 hour (the longest I've heard anyone has played this game besides me is exactly 45.64523432 seconds) it was tucked back into it's case, never to be touched again... Long story short, only play this game if you are a [person] who likes to waste time and money."
1,Ouch,"The game, while very cool looking just tosses you into the mix and while your trying to figure out who these people are and why you are running from city to city trying to save them the vampires are all over you.Where's Buffy When you need here?!?!"
1,Yikes,"I really got tricked into buying this one based on a fairly cool looking cover. I really like hack and slash games, so I thought this one would be perfect for me. I managed to play this one an hour and I was bored silly. The game play is very stiff and repetitive, the music is really inappropriate and pulls you out of the game. Even the sound effects are terrible. The graphics are fairly weak overall. I can put up with poor graphics and other flaws as long as the game is fun. This game is not fun."
2,Dark Angel Vampire Apocolypse,I thought this game was kind of boring. You just go around swinging a sword and killing things. The music was okay.
5,Fun because it's hard,"I liked this puzzle for reasons similar to why the previous reviewer didn't like it. It was very hard, because the tiny photos are all black and white from the civil war era. The satisfaction of completing it was that much better because of the difficulty, and unlike many puzzles it makes great wall art because of the photomosaic image.Then again, I'm perhaps a little masochistic when it comes to puzzles; I like the ones where the image is just a blue sky. If you're easily bored or frustrated this isn't for you; otherwise it's a blast!I gave it 2 stars for durability simply because puzzles by nature aren't very durable if they're made of cardboard, and 3 stars for educational because the civil war images are a very interesting supplement to more complete history found elsewhere."
5,Love It.,"The Wall Hooks are functional andy stylish. They're also able to hold quite a bit of weight with multiple heavier coats without strain to the mount itself or the wall.I already had the longer one for my kids and all their stuff (backpacks, coats, snow gear, etc) and this one was for the big kids (my husband and I) and it's doing its job well!"
4,Pretty sturdy,"This product took a little while to mount. My walls are hollow, so I wasn't sure the screws would stay in, even with anchors. Once I got them in, it took some time to get one of them to stick out at just the exact right distance so that it would catch and slide into the hole. It's worked out very well, though. I hang my winter coats on it and so far, it has stayed put. Since that's why I purchased it, I couldn't be happier!"
5,Grande cantante Frederic Doci,"Un gran cantante, un artista speciale, che riesce a mettere nella sua musica tutta le sue emozioni, i suoi sentimenti ed i suoi pensieri... tutti quelli che ascoltano la tua voce, sono veramente colpiti, perch? veramente fa sognare e trasmette emozioni enormi... sei veramente originario dei tuoi pensieri e delle tue idee... un augurio che tu continui ad essere sempre cos?, tanto simpatico, gentile, tanto straordinario nelle tue musiche e nel tuo lavoro... L'album ""Canterina"" e proprio un successo che chiunque sente le canzoni si sente veramente felice abbandonarsi tra le parole, le note e la voce straordinaria. Vi auguro tanta fortuna nel futuro e di realizzare i sogni nella tua vita professionale e personale. Per te un mondo di felicit?, pace, amore e salute. Con rispetto A.Mezini, Rome (Italy)"
3,Quick little mystery,While good this read is slightly lackluster and a bit predictable. Still an okay read if you're just looking for a little mystery to curl up with over the weekend.
4,Small but really cute,"I love this tin tote but it's a lot smaller than I thought it would be. Not big enough for a lunch box, but nice to put jewelry or whatever in it."
3,Fascinating And Thought-Provoking.,Over the years I have seen this film more than a handful of times. There has always been something about it that's interested me. Just recently I just viewed it again and still find it to be a better-than-average movie. Harrison Ford does a great job as the eccentric inventor along with the rest of the cast. The cinematography and the music are nice too. A movie that is quite fascinating and not bland or boring at all. I actually give Mosquito Coast 3.5 stars. Recommended.
3,Picture Quality,I paid extra for HD and the picture quality was terrible. The movie itself was fine but if you cannot deliver HD you should not expect us to pay extra for something you can't deliver...
4,The story of a man too smart for everybody&#65533;s good.,"Brilliant storytelling (almost fable-like original novel by Paul Theroux) highlights this underrated film of a man's quest for -God only knows.Idealistic inventor Allie Fox (Harrison Ford) packs up the wife and kids, and heads off to the deep part of the Central American jungle, with an ice-making machine, no less.A man of unquenchable thirst, Fox's obsessive, driving quest destroys not only himself and his family, but all that surrounds him as well. There can be no satisfaction in his world, no accomplishment, no salvation.Saul Zaentz (English Patient) produced and Peter Weir (Truman Show) directed, this Paul Schrader script. That's a good enough reason to suggest right here, but Ford is brilliant as he turns from idealistic inventor to self-described deity.Beautiful jungle landscapes only add to the experience.But the moral to the story is?"
2,"Great Acting, Lousy Movie","Although some of the acting is excellent, the movie becomes boring about half way into it. I can't tell you it is a lousy story because I'm not sure that is the problem. I do know the crazy man Ford plays and the whole movie gets a little tedious after he drags his family into the deepest jungle to build a giant ice machine. I have all Ford's movies but this one so I hope that tells you something. I do not recommend you buy this before you rent it."
4,The King and the Cardinal,"Peter Weir directs this film about a man, Aliie, fed up with society who travels with his family to the Mosquito Coast to set up his own Utopia. In the tradition of the Conrad novel Heart of Darkness, Allie(Ford) becomes obsessed with the Utopia he has created an will not let anything or anyone stop him from his near perfect world. The person intent on stopping Allie from his ""destruction of mankind"" is the Rev. Spellgood, a missionary who plans on coverting the heathens along the coast. Allie has his atheistic beliefs though and is not willing to left Rev. Spellgood interfere with anything that he does. For many people this movie was an absolute disgrace and according to my mother it was a complete attack at Christianity and GOD. But if you are willing to put religion aside to get a view from both sides of the fence then Mosquito Coast might have something to offer you. Insight."
1,Lotus Spring is Lame!,"If you like playing games like Myst or Riven, you'll be bored to tears by Lotus Spring. It only gets one star because the buildings are pretty, and I laud the attempt to make a computer game appealing especially to women. But women who like to play computer games deserve much more than Lotus Spring. The story could have been acceptable -- except we're told in the beginning it ends tragically. So what's the point of solving the truly mindless puzzles and reading bad copy (and worse poetry) in Lotus Spring's Diary that must have been written by a non-native English speaker? There are women gamers out here who enjoy playing intelligent, challenging games that aren't fueled exclusively by testosterone-induced blood lust. If you're one of us, don't buy Lotus Spring--instead go to an online aution site and look for a (now out of print) copy of Obsidian."
4,A Romantic Fairytale,"Pros ...- pretty good graphics- okay special effects- Romantic story- good for gamers would like role-playing games with puzzles- emotionally-enthralling game- beautiful scenery and details!Cons ...- the special effects themselves could use some work.- although the dialogue is in English, it takes place in feudal China and NONE of the writing is in English (hope you can read Chinese!)* NOTE: Even if you don't understand the Chinese writing system (like me), it's not a crucial part of understanding the game and not at all necessary when it comes to game installation or game controls.Compatible with...- Windows 95/98Legend of Lotus Spring (Jewel Case)"
2,"Good graphics, but boring.","Lotus Spring has very nicely done graphics and intricate details. However, there's virtually no plot to the game. Right from the beginning I was already confused as to what exactly the point of the story would be. You end up going around beautiful scenaries looking for really pointless and boring poems. I made myself finish the game because I didn't want to waste my money."
5,Fantastic!,"This film is the one of the best I have seen in a long time. The cast is awesome, especially the beautiful Lauren German. It's a very sad movie too and lots of suspense throughout. The score is also beautiful in places. Highly recommended!"
1,Very bad!!!!,"I speak 8 languages and I have experience of learning languages by myself. I thought it would be a great challange to study Latvian but..... not with THIS book. This book is confusing, the sound is poor, the speakers talk to fast and it seems that there is no logic in the grammer at all."
4,I'm happy,the 1st drill I received had a bad wobble in the chuck.I went the return process and I wanted an exchange.My replacement arrived in 3 days and is perfect.The wobbly one is on it's way back.I'm happy with the drill/driver and more the pleased withAmazon's service.
2,Overpriced parts needed for repair.,"They are no longer worth the money. Quality has gone down and parts prices have gone up. I have several of these, and every time one fails, it costs an arm and a leg to buy a new part. I have finally given up on DeWalt and just cannibalize another drill to get a part without going broke. DeWalt is useless in helping me with repair advice, and small parts are not available to the consumer. All they say is ""Take it to our repair service.""Their battery packs are horribly expensive, too."
2,Was this a refurbished model?,"Our drill seems to work fine, but it also looked like it had been used before we received it. The batteries were charged and there were scratches on it. The price was great so we have decided to keep it, but I do wonder......."
3,We have 12 of these,"The drill is greatThe chuck is garbageThey will drive quite a few 4"" screws before they start smoking. Even after they do the seem to keep running. Only one burned out so far.The problem with all Dewalt 18V is why by the batteries for $120 when you can buy a charger 2 batteries and the drill for the same price.I walked into HD the other day and the had the Flashlights on sale for $99 with two batteries and a charge so I bought all they had in the store."
1,nice drill except for the useless chuck!,"If you need this drill for anything other than drilling wood or driving fasteners buy a chuck too. I am an industrial mechanic/machinist and have been for over 30 years. I do most of my work with metal. I do a lot of drilling and tapping at the machine which means I need good tools. The company I work for bought 2 of these about 4 months ago and for what i need them to do they just SUCK! The chuck can't hold on to a drill bit trying to drill metal period, never mind a tap! I have been after my supervisor to get replacement Jacobs chucks for these to months now. He like me are sold on Dewalt tools, but he has a hard time believing that these chucks suck this bad. He no longer is doing the work, so I don't blame him. Dewalt should be asshamed of themselves for putting such a piece of junk on the end of such a good tool."
4,A good start,"If you're looking for an introduction to AJAX, this book is alright. WAY too many pages are devoted to a history lesson at the beginning and a summary of frameworks at the end. In the middle, however, is some good stuff. By chapter 3 you'll know enough to make some cool things happen. The discussion of working through and maniuplating the DOM in chapter 3 is really worth the price of the book.If you know something about AJAX, this book probably isn't too helpful. If you're worked through a handful of tutorials on the web and are ready to invest some time to get a good handle on AJAX, this book is pretty good."
3,"A good starting point for AJAX, but not for the advanced","This book is a fast read for someone who wants to learn what AJAX is all about. The examples are very simple, but do provide a basis for understanding what AJAX is all about.I found the second half of the book incredibly valuable. It talks about development tools, testing with JsUnit and debugging JavaScript. Some tools and techniques that I've never seen in one place (but I haven't looked ;) As fast as AJAX is growing in popularity I can see this entire book being covered in a couple of introductory chapters inside another book."
2,This is a disappointment,"I bought one of these nail guns about three years ago and now I am shopping for a replacement. Although I have used Senco nail guns for more than 20 years, my new nail gun will not be a Senco. The owner's manual is generic, covering a wide range of Senco models but not this particular model. When it jammed (and it does jam), I had to phone Senco to find out how to free the jam. Although the older Senco nail guns had an easy system for freeing a jam, this one does not. You have to take the lower part of the gun apart. I cannot get the depth adjustment to work consistently. Sometimes it sets a 16 penny nail correctly and sometimes it does not."
2,Unique Sound,"I did not care for this album.Voodoo Chicis by far Much Better! ""Subliminal Punk"", is one of the better tracks on this album. It reminds me of her newest song,"" Doesn't Get Much Better Than This"" on her new albumMetropolitan"
1,worst piece of garbage,This book contains so many falsehoods! I was present in San Antonio Aguas Calientes when the events described ... what was written is ABSOLUTE GARBAGE ... do not waste your money! The editor should have made an effort to verify the information submitted!
5,best blending of history and medicine I have ever seen.,"This series is like no other I have seen. The portrayal of how nurses worked a 100+ years ago in a hospital that was considered the best and brightest and highest tech possibly of the time, the authenticity of the medical scenes and the social mores of the past is so acurate and fascinating! I could not take my eyes away from watching these epidsodes. Well done!!"
2,bad soap opera,"It had a story line to it, but the character were not expounded expounded upon. When things started to get interesting between characters they took at least one character away. I do understand the writers are trying to go by how life was in the day, but they forgot to make the story interesting in the process."
4,Rated #1 by demons and the undead,"Darkstalkers 3 - Circa 1998GOOD:- Good Balanced 2D fighter- An old school fighter that really stands out art style or theme wiseBAD:- Loading times, short but still there- Not much bonuses- The games art style or theme is not for everyoneWILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:- Really off the wall looking/acting fighters based on old Hollywood ""B"" movie monsters but with anime look and feel- Surprisingly plays similar to Street Fighter AlphaGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Samurai Showdown 4- Guilty Gear (original)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- Practicality same game on Sega Saturn and Playstion Portable- Darkstalkers franchise has been through a few names the original was called Darkstalkers and the second was called Night Warriors- Darkstalkers 3 has all Fighters and moves from Darkstalkers and Night Warriors"
3,Warning,"I just wanted to warn everyone that this device does not work with the new slimmer psp 2000 series.I own one of these and I also own both the older model psp and the newer 2000 series, and I have to say that it definitely does what it is supposed to do. So, if you own the older psp and you don't have any intention of getting the newer model I would recomend this to you."
5,Marilyn Wann rocks!,"I've had the pleasure of meeting Marilyn Wann and being exposed to her funny, fiery brand of educating people about fat-acceptance. She speaks from her own heart and experience. Marilyn's hair is shocking pink, and her talent is red hot.Who else would put a bunch of fat naked butts together, just so the reader can find a similar one to their own and better acknowledge its cuteness."
5,Banker's Boxes,"This is the best model of banker's box we have found, and we received them quickly. Good job!"
3,Writer's Blocks for Babies?,"Ho-hum. Not really badly done, but neither our 1-year old nor we found this video particularly interesting, although he does zone in and out of parts of it. Again, with the canned Mozart in the background! (Ah, yes, a snippet a day makes your child a genius, according to the latest research). But the music is not really integrated in any way to the content, just slapped into the background. Example of how the production values are poor, especially sound. And what's with the blocks spelling out the words? In my view, a clever sop for anxious parents---in fact, no child young enough to sit through this mundane video is going to have a clue that b-u-b-b-l-e has anything to do with ""bubble."" Buy it if you have nothing better in mind."
1,He coulda made a million dollars . . .,If he'd just stop with all this bunny stuff and sold a million pixels like that guy in England did in just under 5 MONTHS!!
1,a sick scam.,"This is a scam, this man is one sick lazy individual that instead of getting a decent job takes advantage of people that have a heart. Buying this book wont save bunnies..buying this book will make a sick individual have gotten away with a sad excuse for a business and if we help him..it will only trigger more lazy individuals to do such cowardly acts to earn money."
1,A disappointment...much to my suprise,I found this book to be boring. Plain and simple. This book read like a college text book and not a colorful interpretation of Ottoman life.I have read other interpretations of historical periods and found that the ones that read like a novel and not like a book for geared towards individuals studying for their doctorial thesis are more interesting and allow the average reader the opportunity to truly develop a sense of history.
4,"Character, justice, and love are the themes of this film","Except for the Colorado scenery, this is not your standard Western. The emphasis is on character rather than action. James Cagney plays a tough rancher who is actually not such a bad man. There is an interesting romantic triangle involving Cagney, Irene Pappas, and Don Dubbin. There is an excellent supporting cast, including Lee Van Cleef, Stephen McNally, Vic Morrow, and Jeanette Nolan.Justice is one of the main themes of this excellent film. Cagney is a loner who is used to delivering his own peculiar kind of justice. Once Cagney gets the ""hanging fever"" nothing can stop him, Irene Pappas comments. In the end, the film has much to say about love, justice, and humanity. Most Westerns deliver much less."
4,HAVE A FUN CHRISTMAS,THE CHILDREN I GAVE THIS CD REALLY LIKE IT EXCEPT FOR ONE SONG THE 12 DAYS OF CHRISMAS SONG WAS A LITTLE CRUDE.
3,The Chase Scene,The movie is really stilted and dated but the chase scene is still one of the best. If not for the car stuff the film is not that good!
4,"A bad script saved by sex, violence and character actors!",The title of this review sums it up! The script was probably written on toilet paper or cocktail knapkins. The plot goes something like this; bad dude armed robber emerges from the slammer to pick up the loot and get out of Dodge City. Other bad guys try to stop him. Ex Con finds out his old lady was banging the opposition while he was in slammer. Paybacks are a [...]! The producer had to save this movie by filming some steamy scenes with McGraw & McQueen (plus others) and then getting allot of action scenes to wake everyone up for the steamy stuff! Some of the bad guys are just too animated to be taken seriously - you want to hear them say their lines in Japanese so you don't have a clue but it is funny! (Unless you actually speak Japanese - then you wish for Russian)
1,The Getaway,"movie was good a long time ago but this dvd I sent back as the disc was defective,but the movie is good"
5,Deserves Ten Stars,"The Getaway is that great rarity in American pictures -- a movie that takes its time to tell a good story with full dimensional characters. In the tradition of Antonioni's great films, The Passenger and Blow Up, and the Coen Borthers' No Country for Old Men The Getaway is sparse in dialogue but long in action. And not just simple chase scenes, while there are plenty of them, but a real story, before and after. This was the movie which sparked the romance between Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw. The spark between the two is genuine and authentic. Slim Pickens, who plays a minor role at the end of the movie, is a joy to watch. Peckenpah was a versatile director who directs this film with the meticulous detail of a great artist. A remake of this movie was made in the 90s. Did they really think they could have made a better movie? The movie is highly recommended and can be viewed time and again."
5,"great product, a must-have for babies and toddlers","absolutely love this product, is definitely a must have if you have little ones and like to go out to eat. If you don't want to worry when their hands touch the restaurant's table surface, you need this. I love that you stick the mat on the table and then put finger food on it for them to it so both adults and children can have a nice meal out without being constantly worried about germs and stuff. They really thought this one out!"
1,"Nice if you want it for looks, terrible if you actually use it.","Although this shaker looks nice sitting on the counter with the rest of the set, it is TERRIBLE for mixing drinks. The very first time it was used my boyfriend (a previous bartender) was mixing a Mai Tai and when he removed the cap to pour the drink trapped liquid spilled out of it and all over his hand and the counter. When he then tried to remove the whole top in order to dump the ice into the sink more left-over liquid spilled out of the seal between the top and bottom sections and all over his hands again! After making only one drink he exclaimed that he really did not like the shaker. I'm tossing it and going back to get the the Metrokane Bullet instead, as recommended by Cook's Illusrated. Apparently what I should have done in the first place."
1,no and no and no,"I love Hannah Howell. I have all of her books including the older ones and if i see a book by her i buy it no questions asked. which i did with this book. I wish i hadn't. I had to struggle to finish this book and in the last couple chapters i skipped them. I didn't care what happened to the characters. We weren't told how they met and fell in love. Not knowing anything about that made me feel that i missed out on a big part of the story. I have the story before this one about his twin brother and it didn't mention anything about Lucas, just that he was away. the epilogue was better then the whole story and it made me wish that Ms Howell had written more about the people in the epilogue. I hate to give this book one star but I truly disliked it. I am taking it back to the store i disliked it so much and i always have Ms Howell's books on my 'keeper' shelf. Not this one."
1,Save your money,"Where to begin? Well, in short, the author seems a bit out of touch with reality & I honestly have a really hard time believing many of her stories. The silliest one being that she & her groupie friends had given some flowers to one of the band's road crew to pass along. A month or so later, her friend just happens to run into Bono & asks if he got them. ""Those were from you""? he says. With all the things bands go through on the road, city after city turning into a blur, not to mention the loads of flowers they receive, this little tale just doesn't seem likely.The reports of the band's wardrobe for each show get old *very* quickly, as did what the author and her friends ate for dinner each night and where they ate it! She mentions over and over again that her favorite song is ""Bad"" and each performance the Edge gives is ""the best one she's ever seen!""Sorry, but this book really isn't worth the money."
1,Diary of a mad woman!,"Your money can be spent better on more insightful U2 books. In this book the author does an excellent job of keeping detailed records of her journeys and the little ""run-in's"" with the band.(Or as I like to call them ""stalking sessions"") She also does an excellent job of boring me. This book for me was the equivilant of sitting at my cousin's house watching an 6-hour slide show of his vacation to Delaware. I love U2 as much as the next fan but she goes a little overboard in the way she speaks of Bono. I don't care what Bono was wearing on March 9, 1992! Or what HER interpation of the music is. How about telling me what Bono thinks about his music, life, sports, religion etc..... Oh she can not do this because she is a physco fan. It almost makes me embarrased to call myself a die hard U2 fan."
3,Frustraing,"Just like the old PS1 version there is apparently no way to save your progress, even though a memory card is required.Every time I start I must begin again.I don't have a 6-hour block to dedicate to winning a game, thats ridiculous."
1,don't buy this junk,"After reading the preview from PC World I bought BackUpMyPC with a lot of expectations.After downloading it backed up , but yu can not open it.I called several times technical support: unbelievable: they say this software does not work with adaptec cd burner software.Their suggestion: delete the adaptec everytime yu want to work with BackUpsoftware.It means that all Dell computers can not work with Back Up.Be Aware and don't touch this one."

2,Looking forward to Escribien dos,"The product is easy to use when everything is working. However, I find that it freezes at least once for each document. This means that the program has to be closed out and restarted, losing everything that has not yet been saved. I have not been able to right click copy files for an e-mail. I have to open the file in Microsoft Word, copy it from there and then paste it to an e-mail. The accents, fonts, and text colors are preserved in this way. Yesterday I lost a paragraph from the Escribien page that wasn't saved despite numerous save clicks. It is gone forever. I still use Escribien but am constantly monitoring that I can recover what I have written. If I can find a better Spanish processor I will buy it."
3,I hate this book,"This book is a product of confused Authors , it began well but after one week i could'nt get an application running that could retrieve Information from the Database. The Source Code downloaded from the web site was quite different from Book"
1,I can't believe how much it cost,The TDK cleaner was satisfactory but the shipping charges were rediculous. I paid a little over $4 for the tape and $21 for shipping. I will never oder from this company again. I feel ripped off.
1,unreliable,within 2 days of use the case turned upside down and the phone fell outthe swivel should not let the case turn more than 60 degrees in my opinion
4,It Is A Cathedral,"The only problem was there wasn't nearly enough time on the disc to really get into all of the little things that this stadium has seen. It was done well and is certainly worth buying, but anyone who's either ever been to the stadium or knows about it's (& Yankee) history will feel kind of slighted. It's kind of like going to your favorite band's concert and only hearing the hits that you've heard 1,000 times before when you wanted to hear the ""deep cuts""."
5,History of Yankee Stadium DVD,I am very pleased with my purchase of this great DVD that I have added to my Yankee DVD collection. Thanks!
4,Wait for Criterion Collection edition.,"Great film (5 stars), however, I was extremely disappointed by this ""blu-ray"". It is nothing more than the DVD version on a blu-ray disc. The Criterion Collection edition will feature a high-definition transfer, which this film so greatly deserves."
5,Criterion Collection = 5 STARS!,"What an absolute perfect release for this movie. After reading all the negative reviews it's obvious most of them are due to the previous inadequate releases. Well, they should all log back in and delete them because this IS the definitive release of one of my all time favorite movies! The '70s-era packaging and a totally awesome selection of bonus features makes this special edition two-disc release of Dazed and Confused one of the very best DVDs of all time!Some of the best lines ever!""Let me tell you what Melba Toast is packin' right here, all right. We got 4:11 Positrac outback, 750 double pumper, Edelbrock intake, bored over 30, 11 to 1 pop-up pistons, turbo-jet 390 horsepower. We're talkin' some f'n' muscle."" --Wooderson""That's what I love about these high school girls, man. I get older, they stay the same age."" --Wooderson""Say, man, you got a joint?"" --Wooderson""No, not on me, man. "" --Mitch""It'd be a lot cooler if you diid."" --Wooderson"
5,Feature Corrections,"This edition of the DVD does not contain any commentary tracks. Amazon lists a commentary track by Richard Linklater, class-reunion style, but this commentary track is not mentioned on the DVD cover, slip, or anywhere in the menus.For those of you looking forward to a commentary about this awesome movie, like me, it is disappointingly absent."
4,A Classic,"This is a great movie. It brings you back to when you were a teen, in high school, with your friends having great times. It was fun to watch with my friends when we were 17 18 and it's still fun to watch 12 years later. Enjoy!"
4,"Sex, Drugs, & Rock n' Roll!","4 1/2 Stars = Minor MasterpieceThis movie gets it 95% right. Just love it. It's like watching my high school years all over again. A time when big brother was not perched on you, looking over your shoulder, & people just excepted the exuberance of youth. No rap, hip hop, extreme metal, or gangs, just great music. Just unadulterated fun! Just a time of more freedom, when rock n- roll, drive-in movies, & friendship was all you needed. Not that many of these things are not true now, but this was a simpler, more free time in many ways.The soundtrack is spot on for a time for me when everything was new, fun, & not jaded. A true portrait of a time that will never be again, not for me. All the more amazing since it was from 1993, but the people behind this film were obviously not.Take a trip back in time!"
4,DazEd is GrOOvy,"A perfect flick to watch before a full night of partying. Dazed and Confused reminds us that life is pretty simple when you break it down, just have fun and live it up. Although there isn't much of a plot that develops, this film's still great cause of the soundtrack and non-predictable humor that percolates in situations. Think of it as a Porky's, but add 2 stars to the rating and some quality reefer."
4,The Good Old Days,"The Movie brings back the days of my final year in High School back in the 70s, enjoyed the movie very much"
5,The movie that just keeps getting better,"This is one of those movies that just gets funnier and better every time you see it. Granted, the plot isn't that great, but it doesn't have to be. Smokin' weed and drinkin' beer. Did anyone not do that in high school? If you didn't, then you probably won't enjoy this movie as much as everyone else. But you simply can't dislike this movie."
5,Dazed & Confused RULES!!!!!!!,"If anyone ever doubted watching this movie, Let this review put your doubt to rest. This movie ROCKS!!!!!!!!, yeah I know it's it's a typical stoner movie but still I find it's a great movie. If you don't like the movie you will LOVE!!!!!! the Music espically if you Love Rock.Rock MusciFan"
5,THE BEST,"Put simply, this is THE best movie (to me) of all time. Makes you want to just wake up and live highschool to its fullest. Just buy it, I know you'll love it."
1,The extra features are extra bad,"I am sure if you are reading the reviews for this movie you probably know what it is about, if not there are other reviews that cover the movie itself.(grab soapbox, put it on the ground, climb on it)I am here to talk about the ripoff of companies releasing several different versions of DVD's. All of them have a little tiny bit of an interesting extra feature but none of them have enough to justify the extra money charged. This is a blatant attempt to get the consumer to pay a lot of money for very little reason. This DVD has almost nothing to make it worth the extra $15 you have to pay. There are some mildly amusing moments in the extra features but nothing of substance. Stick with your old copy or buy it cheaper if you really must have it.(get off of soapbox, pick it up, put it away)Dazed and Confused is a hilarious movie and worth watching every time. The extra features on this DVD are not worth paying extra for."
5,Fun Film that Hits the Spot,"This is a great movie that really makes you wish you could go back to high school. The music is outstanding and I highly recommend buying the first soundtrack -- if not the second one, too. This film takes a pretty realistic look at life as a worthless teenager. Though some may slam it as a movie that doesn't have a point, I think there is a theme that can be summed up rather easily: although it's a lot of fun to be a careless teenager, people naturally want direction in their lives, even if that direction means going against what others might want for us (this is best demonstated in ""Pink's"" unwillingness to sign the football team's petition to not drink, do drugs, etc.). The movie's ending -- an open road from the perspective of the people sitting in the front seat of a car -- is a wonderful way to conclude the message of this film: the open road of life is right before us, and it is our jobs to make sure ours is a fullfilled journey."
5,Simply a masterpiece for our times,"Affleck's ""O-B Badass"" is one of the most memorable characters in film. From his first appearance as a failed, ""fifth year"" senior onward, Affleck soars as the quintessential high school bully. And while he rightfully gets paint poured on his head, his departing threats and violent exit give his character an almost tragic dignity. I think that in a film colored by stereotypical characters, he's the absolute best. Whenever my friends and I sit down and watch the film for the hundreth time, we always look forward to Affleck's passionate, hillarious, and self-defeating antics."
2,Anonymous from Jasmes Jennings,I guess it proves the point that not all James Jennings works get 5 stars from me ... I would have only given it 1 star but Im a FAN of Jennings so he gets a freebeeee.....The book deals with Andrew and Sohia in Victorian England AND since the title says high places it gets very tied up in proving the pint that they are talking about important people without mentioning their names ..I read it once and it's placed in an unreachable spot in my ... library ....
1,Lady In the Water Soundtrack,"Well, if you think you will hear the song you heard in the commercial on TV, forget about it. It is not on the soundtrack.How does that work? Most of it is instrumentals that sound as if they were recorded underwater. Hey, maybe they were for Mermaids. Oh, well. I am out but I hope you save your money."
4,Only One Selection Stands Out,"Although this album is very well done, I think that only one selection stands out and that is, ""End Titles."" It's some of the most beautiful music I've ever heard. Howard is at the top of his game on this one!"
2,Bassey (should) Sing Bond,"I wanted to type ""Bassey (could) Sing Bond"", but she still can. Her singing is fine. As in a previous review, I too was very disapointed with the arrangements of the songs, and of course the lack of an orchestra. It's almost as if she was recording a 'demo' to be re-recorded later using a real orchestra (and better arrangements). I hope some day this happens. I waited over a year for a copy of this CD to become available (and paid quite a high price) -- but that's because Ms. Bassey was my favorite theme song vocalist for the Bond films and I'm a big fan of both."
1,"Beautiful, but kept losing feathers","It was packaged well & came in plenty of time, unfortunately it kept losing feathers & it would have been around food and a lot of clean up."
3,ok,"Nick throught his world was gonna end, when his beloved Jasmine turned down his marriage proposal, So he moves to Chicago for a new job, and he hope a new chance at love. Nick dosen't find the dating game to be all that easy. The book skips back and forward, back to when Nick and Jasmine first start dating. SOmetime all the different time frames in the book gets kind of confusing."
5,A hit with my 4 year old daughter and 7 month old son!,"I took this book out from the library originally and my daughter and son loved it. It is a must have. The little tadpole wants so badly to jump. He meets up with various animals that can. He asks them all to jump and they all Boing (jump) for him (my son's favorite part) Then the tadpole says, But I want to jump now!"" (my daughters part). All the animals teach him to be patient for his time will come. The tadpole grows into a frog throughout the book. Finally when he meets up with the big bad fish who eats tadpoles he BOINGS himself back to the lily pads and is safely home with his mother. He is also now a frog."
2,toaster that never toasts,"Bought this toaster and it doesn't toast evenly. some comes out burnt, some don't even toast. some are half burnt and half un-toasted. wouldn't recommend this toaster. spend your money and get a REAL toaster"
5,Interesante,"El surgimiento: nace el anticristo' es un libro que se basa en profecías bíblicas que anuncian el peor de los tiempos sobre la tierra a causa del juicio de Dios sobre los pueblos. Muy buena historia. Lo recomiendo. Recomiendo también el libroResurgir de la esvástica, El (Ebook) [Versión Kindle] el cual habla con mucha claridad sobre estos temas del fin de los tiempos."
3,Samsung V2500 only 3 stars,"I bought the V2500 in April and already have problems with the DVD Player. It states the disc is LOADING, but then states NO DISC. It still plays CD's though. The remote only works if you are directly in front of the unit, which is very annoying. I would not buy this again."
4,Pregnancy journal,"This journal is a really fun way to document your experience. I loved it so much with my first pregnancy that I bought another one for my second. I will keep them forever and give them to the kids when they are older. Most of the pages I just filled in with info on what was going on that week, instead of using all of the questions it asked. The folders inside for each trimester are a great place to keep ultrasound photos!"
5,Magnificent!,"This excellent book represents itself as ""a complete explanation of the Catholic Faith"". Certainly, this is an audacious claim. However, the book delivers. I strongly recommend it to anyone seriously interested in learning about the Catholic Faith."
5,belongs on your bookshelf,"This is the finest overview of the Catholic faith I've come across. This is a big book but it's not overwhelming and it is ideal for people going through RCIA (particularly if your RCIA director is not up to the job) and it's great for people who already are Catholic but were never really taught the catechism or for people who need a refresher course.It's clearly written, decisive and is easy to understand. If I had to hand one single book to a person who was asking about the Church this would be the one."
1,Interesting information,"While doing my Master's Thesis I had to read this book to find aout what the catholic church believe. It's a good resource for Pastors and Seminarians who need to understand the errors of the roman catholic church from their own point of view. Be careful if you are not proficient in Biblical Doctrine, because the devil can deviate you from the right path. He is a fool. You need advise from your pastor in any reading you are doing to take advantage of any resource you may need to use for your studies."
2,No Thanks,"I was looking for a guided journal to take the place of my 40 Day and 40 Night Journal by Ilene Segalove after I completed it. This journal caught my eye I suppose because it looked nice and dreamy. It was not at all what I was looking for though. The layout just didn't make sense to me, I didn't like that it was laid out by emmotion. Sometimes I'm not sure how I feel, sometimes I'm not really having any specific emmotional issue, I just want a good prompt to get my mind and pen flowing. This book is beautiful and I'm sure is great for someone, it just wasn't at all what I was looking for."
4,"This isn't a Good book, It's a GREAT one.","I'm 25, African American, and a single mom. Somewhere in my twenties, I got sidetracked and put off everything I ever wanted to do.Just browsing the net one day, I came across this book which absolutely encourages and inspires me to jot down my goals, dreams, aspirations, and stick to them.I would recommend this book to all........."
4,My review of Twenty Jataka Tales,The stories are beautifully written and like Aesop's Tales they deal with people although the stories are about animals. I recommend this book to educators.
4,It Made Me Laugh,"For The Roses starts out as one of the best of Ms. Garwood's novels. I found myself laughing out loud a number of times as the charachters were introduced. The fiery interaction between family members was easy to imagine and enjoy. However, about three-quarters of the way through I began to get frustrated with the main charachters. A change in setting brought such a significant alteration to their personalities that I found myself hurrying through to get back to the ""good stuff"". Overall I enjoyed this novel, though it doesn't follow the format of a typical romance. Readers should be prepared for absence of the expected societal scandal and heroine in distress scenarios that come with most novels of this genre."
1,Awful,"I really enjoyed the first half of this story. However, it was very disturbing to to me that when Rose becomes afraid during her first sexual encounter with Harrison in the bunk house that HE HOLDS HER DOWN until she stops struggling. In this century we call that not consensual sex, or rape. Then the next night Rose is actually telling him that he's hurting her, and does he stop? NO! That's a serious problem. I think the author and Harrison use two excuses for him to ignore her obvious ""NO"" 1) She's a virgin so the first time having sex HAS TO BE PAINFUL, and 2) She's going to enjoy sex once Harrison once she's gets passed the pain. Which is typically not true,most women DO NOT orgasm their first time.It's not okay to force your partner into doing anything they're not comfortable with or are actively saying ""NO"" to.In summary, Rape isn't sexy"
5,Wonderful,I loved this book. Garwood's depiction Mary Rose's brothers is wonderful. She gave each one a unique personality and the love that surrounded the family and the obvious love of an unseen mother was touching. This book is a must for the true sentimentalist. After reading the other reviews I think that the people who gave it less than 5 stars were either judging it by her other books or can't follow dialogue. This book is a must and I highly recommend it!
1,"Bitter, bitter","I usually love Yogi products but this one is TERRIBLE!! It is so bitter I cannot even drink it. TheYogi Chai Black, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)version is much better. If you still want green tea, theAriZona Mandarin Orange Green Tea with Ginseng & Honey Jasmine, 20 Count Tea Bags, 1.55-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)is very good."
3,"Great Sound, Bad Build","The headphones had great sound quality. I used them for studio production, mainly electronic and a few hip hop beats, but the build was bad. They are very heavy, which is good if you are going to be mobile with them, but it hurts after awhile. They are not comfortable headphones. My ears were hurting after about an hour of use. If you are not going to be using these headsets for extended sessions, then buy them. But they will hurt after about an hour.Pros:-Carrying case-Great sound quality-Comes with 2 jacks (1/3 for ipod and laptop, 1/4 for other equipment)-DurableCons:-Heavy-Not comfortable-Can't use for extended sessions-Color (wish they had just black, haha)"
1,Wahhh...Wahhhh...Wah!,"This book truly had plot potential! What a let down!The main charater, Gillian,and her bedfriend Anita were booooring! All they did was whine...whine...and ""can I get U some cheese with that WHINE!"" The story line was whack and so was most of the sex scenes!It should have been titled, "" Sexually Unsatisfied!"" (sorry..I know..real orginal!)Don't waste UR time or money on this one! Just one avid readers opinon."
4,Great software for the money.,"In the beginning I had downloaded and used the trial version. I liked the the software so much better than Pinnacle Studios and Video Factory! If you install this software correctly (CLOSE ALL WINDOWS PROGRAMS, especially antivirus software!) everything should go great. Its graphical interfase is very easy to use. I noticed alot of high end movie editing software options included in this package. It is a very good deal for the money and a novice user shouldn't have any problems....I highly recommend this product."
1,"Technical support, fuhgeddabowdit","I had used Ulead 4.0 for awhile, but when I downloaded the trial version of 6.0 it messed that up, so I went ahead and ordered 6.0. Since that time I've not been able to get it to work properly, and it has locked up no matter WHAT I've tried to do with it. I wrote technical support, and 13 days later have yet to receive a suggestion. Buyer beware.As an addendum, it has now been two months without a response. I received an email after 6 weeks saying I should resubmit my question, and two more weeks have passed without hearing anything back. Might be a good product when it works, but they have the worst customer support I've ever encountered."
1,Garmin Magnetic Mount Antenna f/Astro,I do not recommend this product. The wires are to short to mount unless you run it through the window. There is a aftermarket antenna online which is better quality all the way round.
4,great product,I would have to give this a great review. While hunting with other guys and they loose the signal from their dogs they all come to my truck cause I will still have them picked up!
4,Look Inside the Hype,"Very good nuts and bolts look at day to day life in the Legion. Well worth reading (I don't automatically give 5 stars). One thing I noted. Training at the small unit level seems to be OK but with seemingly an over-arching emphasis on physical fitness over tactics. Training at the battalion level and above seems to be scarce. Combined arms or joint training seems to be totally lacking. What this means is that in the legion (and maybe the whole frog army) you have units who can't shoot, manuver and communicate at a level above (perhaps) company. Combat isn't totally or even primarily a PT test. Not reassuring if we ever have to depend on them on our flank in a pinch, granted an unlikely scenario. And who could ever depend on the french anyway??"
5,A MASTERPIECE!!,"I would like to congratulate Mr McGorman for writing such an amazing book about the Foreign Legion. Since I am thinking about joining the Legion somewhere down the line , I tried to gather as much information as possible. So far I have never read a book which was so moving and truthful coming from an ex legionnare before. I emailed him and thanked him for telling the Legion for what it really is. He was kind enough to reply and answer few of my questions. I would recommend this book to anyone who is even slightly considering to join the Legion."
5,Good Quality & Fast Shipping,I just received the apron I ordered and I am really happy with it. Shipping was fast and the apron is good quality (especially for the price). I would highly recommend this.
2,You wont miss this one if you skip it.,This book is mainly reading a book of shadows. I started it and almost fell asleep. I put it down and started on the next one right away. I didnt miss a thing. The book to me was a waste of a read and really instit on skipping this book in the series.
2,"Great series, but not one of my favorite books.","In this book Morgan and Hunter read the Book of Shadows of one of Morgan's ancestors. Basically this ancestor is a misguided but powerful witch who ends up creating something evil. I hate books where I want to scream at the characters that what they're doing is wrong and they end up creating their own trouble. The ancestor girl (name slipped my mind) starts out doing one bad love spell and it spirals into this huge disaster. Even though everyone the girl should trust is telling her that what she is doing is wrong she's so stupidly arrogant that she keeps on plowing her way through, certain that she alone is right. I love this author, but this book made me want to bang my head against the wall."
1,This item is an old model and does not do ther same functions as a new model. I'm very un happy.,I purchased this item from a third party. The item is an old model and does not perform like a newer model even having the same model number(gv-D1000). I spent $640 on this used item and I have wasted my money. I'm very displease with the sellers not bring out this point about the product being an older model. The newer model has many more features and does what I want it to do. A close friend has a newer model and that's what sold me on the item. When I recieved this item and tried to do the same as my friends I could not do this. I called Sony and they informed me the older models would not do the same as the newer ones I realize the new model cost $800 more than what I spent for this used one. Well all in all I'm very displease with the seller for not bring out this point.Roger Barile
1,learn about the author before reading his work,"I recommend anyone new to Harlon Ellison to learn about the author as a person before reading his work. He's a pompous, overbearing, egotistical little man (literally) who thinks he is better than everyone else in the world, and if you don't worship him then he hates you. Read a few pages of his work to see this attitude reflected completely in his bloated writing style. You can do this with Amazon's ""first page"" feature or just google him to see his stuff before buying it. You'll save yourself some money."
5,Great CD!,"Great CD. I got it yesterday when I went into the office and played it last night. The night was really still until the CD started playing and then, simultaneously with the first sounds of the wind chimes on the speakers, the plants in my living room started moving in the breeze. I knew that music could do powerful things, but this is the first time I've seen it affect the weather! The music is really relaxing and I'll be playing that one a lot."
4,NO SELF-HELP ATTACHED,"Thank God for Mr. Barnett. It was so easy to understand and read due to the fact that he gets down to brass tacks and does not add the fluff that all self-help authors do. Straight forward and to the point with basic communication tips that can help anyone in any situation. Wether it be relationship/communication issues or sales, the point is the same: Effective communication. Common-sense communication tips. Thank you Mr. Barnett."
4,"Strategically great, tactically lacking","This is a great book, it's very relevant to the times, I love the vision and the idea. The problem is that the authors really don't tell you how to actually do anything. So, I'd definintely recommend the book for an easy read, but if you're looking for advice on implementation - you'll be disappointed."
3,Recommended but not much of a surprise,"About 15 years ago I read a book called ""Start-up."" The author talked about strategy for start-ups. He recommended avoiding competition by focusing on the ""white spaces."" This book calls it ""blue ocean."" The concept of targeting new markets where there are few or no competitors is not new. Another entrepreneur recommended this book to me. It was easy to read and only took me a couple of days, but the concepts are not new. The graphical analysis tools, however, were novel concepts. I recommend this book for senior executives that are developing strategic marketing plans--not your average mid-level executive."
1,got it very late even though i paid for two day shipping,I ordered this book for two days delivery and got it after 15 days till that time i had already purchased the book from some other physical store and moreover there was no space to return this book to the sender ... Very poor
1,BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY,"The book I purchased was supposed to be new, but it was not new and had highlighting in it which means someone else used the book. I have written twice complaining to the seller and Amazon that I want a used sales price and to be reimbursed the difference, but nobody has responded. This is very poor customer service!!!Barbara Rose 301-890-0279"
1,Agree completely. Deja vue after the fact junk,I agree with the reviewer who qualified this book as a rebranding of what every company (or almost every) tries to do. It's repetitive nonsense. Don't waste your money.
5,Must read,REVOLUTIONARY!!!!! If you ever wanted a book to step by step strategy this is it!! Completely practical and based on so much data. This was recommended to me by my Director and so did not disappoint!!!! YOU HAVE TO HAVE A COPY OF THIS ONE!
5,Brilliant,An excellent book and an inspiring piece of work. A valuable resource for anyone in business.
5,This book rocks. consider my eyes opened,"The articles are beautiful arranged to simulate (hopefully) the progression of the reader who utilizes the text. First, you get the typical introduction, and then the beginning chapters focus on some more accessible themes that we probably encounter. However, as you get deeper into the text, it gets a bit more analytical, but not to the point where you are overwhelmed. My professor said we should not sell the book since we will always be referring to it when a current event props up. She was right. I sold my book but a lot of times when I hear something in the media that is not necessarily related to Women's Studies or even feminist studies, this reader always finds a way to creep into my consciousness. The authors in the article are all well-respected in their fields, and they have a magnificent way of conveying their intentions without explicitly stating them."
1,I already sent you a 5-6 page review of the 4-5 pages of letters,"I believe there were 6 letter exchanges with your representative. She couldn't get it right. She sent me the wrong timer twice and ended up sending me a complete refund. I had to buy the desired unit from another dealer.Since you are asking me for another review I can only assume that you lost the last one. I believe that I am gaining a better understanding of your ability to perform customer service.If you really want the previous detailed review, I believe I still have a copy.An unhappy customer, Bill Harthill"
3,Kid Friendly,"The book was advertised as ""new"", but it shows some wear. This was purchased as a gift for my granddaughter, but I did read through the recipes and they appear to be ones that could be made by a 10 year old with little adult supervision."
1,?Cooking?,"I was very disappointed. It's not really a cookbook but more of a guide on combining processed foods. Very few (3-4) ""recipes"" for things I'd feel okay about feeding to my little ones."
3,"Decent, but only basic map","This is a very basic map of Lisbon and covers almost exclusively the downtown area (and Belem). During several days in Lisbon we only used it 1-2 times.Two main reasons for the 3 stars:- The map is very limited in geographic coverage and provides only a very basic idea of the city's transportation system;-- Better map options are available -- Lisbon tourist bureaus (http://www.askmelisboa.com/en) have far better (more detailed and larger) free maps of the city; those maps are available at most hotels as well as at askmelisboa kiosks throughout the cityWhile other maps by Streetwise can be very helpful and comprehensive (such as the Streetwise Manhattan MapStreetwise Manhattan Map - Laminated City Street Map of Manhattan, New York - Folding pocket size travel map with subway map, bus map) this map is not of that standard.My suggestion - save your money and use the map in your guidebook for starters until you get a free local map once you are in Lisbon."
3,Searching For Good Acting,"I would tend to agree with the previous two reviewers regarding some aspects of this film. The cinematography is beautiful. That may be a backhanded compliment, cause how can you go wrong in Monument Valley? The screenplay flows naturally. The basic storyline is well arranged in that you remain interested in the films progression. And the director gets some strong opinions across to the audience. in those respects this is a good indie find.What murders this movie is the lame acting. the two main characters are too aware of the camera. their angle and positioning is artificial. the dialog is too spaced. their rhythm and intonation is stifling. their interaction is too syntheic. in that regard the viewer is not allowed to be absorbed into the movie, but always looking in from a distance. sure, maybe a few feet away, but never in it.So, all n all it floundered."
3,Just OK,"This is great when collapsed to 10', but expanded to full length it doesn't ""feel"" as stable. I works fine, but the beams seem to flex, to and from each other, not up and down making your footing feel less than sturdy. It does hold well, but just doesn't feel like it will. In my opinion, a little pricy; of course, so are the ladders that go with it!"
4,product was what i expected.,it is a little twisty when spanned out to 10-12 feet but otherwise very sayisfied with it for indoor use so far. Shoukld come in handy outside as well
4,Perfect companion for Maybe It's Live,"I was fortunate to have seen Robert Palmer in concert twice ('91 & '99) therefore I know that this is a performer who should have more than just ONE live album in his catalog. Thanks to this import, we now have two. This recording is from the 1988 tour so a lot of material is from 'Heavy Nova' and 'Riptide' but there's a few surprises including: Looking for clues, John & Mary, Woke up laughing and Pride. Combine this CD with Maybe It's Live and you have the full spectrum of Robert's career. The price of this CD is high but it's worth it."
3,Sheets 101,"These are standard sheets. A little thin if you are used to the really high thread count sheets, but they still have the quality that is needed for repeated use. Worth every cent."
1,Book for SQL novice,This book is good for a person whom does not know any thing about SQL and Database Designing. If you are an Experience whom trying to get ready for the exam. then save your money and look for different one. This book will just wast your time.
1,for looks only,Theese trays are for looks only...My husband uses TV traysdaily...We have had the same for 30 years...I wanted somethingdifferent...They should have a label...DO NOT USE...LOOKS ONLY.They are crap....Every single one has fallen apart...They arein the garbage now...
2,Poorly made,I must agree with previous reviews. Darth Maul's lightsaber broke before I even got him out of the box. Not nearly as good as other Star Wars products....disappointing...
4,A must see for any Drunken master fan...,"The different facets of this title is beyond words. The choreography of the fight senses alone is enough to make the modest of martial arts enthusist screen locked. While the need for the camera play wasn't necessary, it isn't enough to warrent a pass on this other wise fabulos screen innovation..."
3,"some songs are stunning, others tiresome...a truly mixed bag","This cd starts off so promising, especially with the perfect ""Drinking Woman"" but falters later on in the cd when poor production value and shakey vocals begin to lose their charm and start to agrivate. Will Oldham is a wonderful musician, however he seems to be in a rut with this album. I don't regret buying this cd because the few songs that I like, I REALLY LIKE...but the others are rather skipable. If you are a major fan of Palace or Will Oldham, this is still a must-have, but for others who are unsure, you might be better off copying it from a friend."
2,Not really for professional use,"I purchased this book while in my first year at fashion school in the hopes that it would supplement the techniques I was learning in my fashion illustration course. I never used the book, though. The templates and style of fashion illustration used are dated and the proportions were not what we were being taught at school, which rendered the templates unusable for me. Even after I learned how to properly sketch for fashion I couldn't adapt or use the templates because current fashion illustration shows a more elongated, stylized silhouette. I ended up sending this book to my 12-year-old niece, who has shown an interest in fashion design and will probably find it useful for basic construction of fashion silhouettes."
1,A waste of $15.37.,This had to be one of the worst books I have ever read. Save your money. The author has obviously never hit menopause. This could have been a good story done right but it was just too silly for words.
5,Hot Flash Club,This book is extremely entertaining....very very funny...I can certainly identify with many of the situations!!!
1,Is this some other Nancy Thayer?,"I'd prefer if a writer had nothing to offer, it wouldn't get written or published. Nancy Thayer has written wonderful books (3 Women at the Water's Edge, Nell, Stepping, Morning, etc) but has been underserving her fans for several years now.This book is so dull and insipid and pointless, that it's hard to believe it's the same writer."
2,No Hot Flash here,"This has a very unrealistic story line, flat characters and little real insight into or solutions for the issues confronted by women passing through menopause and headed into their senior years."
4,Hot flash part is true!,"The hot flash, weight gain, forgetfulness part is all true. The rest is a little over the edge. But for me that is what makes a good book. If I wanted to read hard reality books, I would write one. I like to be entertained and this is exactly what this book did! A great, easy summer read for women over 40! So have fun with reading this book O' fellow menopause women!!"
4,"Funny, Enjoyable Book",This was a great book. The characters are funny and realistic. Seems there are instances in the story all women can relate to whether they have hit menopause or not. I liked this book alot.
1,Piece of junk,Save your money---bought four----applied per directions---2 out of 4 fell of within 10 days--whereabouts unknown
4,Great wagon but needs a few modification.,"This wagon was easy to put together and is very sturdy, but after reading other reviews about the wood turning black when it gets wet I decided to stain all the wood before installing it and it looks a lot better then the plain unfinished wood you receive. The turning radius also hurts it's overall rating but I modified the bottom of the wagon with a few simple handtools and it turns much sharper now yet is still stable with no hint of tipping over or anything like that. For the price it's a great buy and if you paint or stain the wood most people will be happy with it and for those who are mechanically inclined, the turning radius can easily be improved."
5,John Deere Wagon,My wife and I love this wagon. It was much cheaper than other wagons like it and my son loves the John Deere theme to it.
5,I own this cool book,"I felt compelled to write after reading how many people are looking for this book. I guess I was very fortunate to have bought it when it was first published. This book is really great. I wish that del james would write more books. Especially the one promised at the end of this one. THe authorized biography of Guns N' Roses,""Shattered Illusions."" Well thats it I'm off like a prom dress."
2,"Good thoughts, great man, but poorly written book","Dorrance is a skilled horseman and ""whisperer"" whose skill at understanding the horses language is certainly a gift. However, the book came across as disjointed and poorly organized, in places very redundant. I was also disappointed by the tendency to attribute results to almost magical abilities: not much ""meat"" on how to put the training techniques into use."
5,Bought as a gift,Even though this book was bought used it was in excellent condition I purchased this book for a christmas present
5,Star review,Tamagotchis are fun.I have one of my own. i think i would be really sad if they wernt out anymore my brother wants a tamagotchi like mine but he isnt allowed
5,Retrosynthesis Primer,The book treats the subject of organic retrosynthesis in a very clear fashion. It will be a perfect companion for students taking sunthetic organic chemistry course.
5,Exhaust / Tail pipe cutoff tool,Works exactly as described. Approx 1/3 rotation several times cuts thru pipe cleanly and evenly. Tools seems simple and well made.
2,Strange,"Did not capture my imagination at all. Just seemed bizarre. I usually movies with unusual twists and turns. But, I got totally lost. I was not sure what was going on. Unlike Inception, which had incredible cinematography and direction, this movie wanders a bit aimlessly. I did not get into it at all."
4,Forget the budget - its good on any terms,No idea why people keep going on about the low budget. It sells for the same price as any other movie.That said i liked it - I needed to watch it twice and with subtitles the second time because it was sometimes hard catching the dialogue including one key plot point which was mumbled off screen . Sometimes the dialogues seemed unecessarily deep (when discussing super conductors) and sometimes too shallow ( when discussing the output of a 12 volt car battery - yeah we know its 12 volts).I am still not clear on exactly how many times they went round or really entirely sure what the outcome was. I think i know but maybe not.But its clever and quirkly and makes you think. If you like altered universes or shifted time state movies this is one of the best so far.
4,Weird and Strange Movie,"I saw this movie at the end of technology convention in Lake Tahoe, NV. I found this movie to be completely hard to follow and understand. I would highly recommend people going to see this movie at least 2 times. The movie completely skips around a lot. The movie is a science-fiction movie about two people who create a time machine and put it in a storage locker. This movie boarder-lines on a ""Back To The Future"" wanna-be movie; in that you shouldn't interfere with yourself in the past."
1,5 Yawns,This movie has an interesting concept. But if you like watching paint dry then you will love this slow moving uneventful drama. I recommend this movie before buying sleeping pills.Another thing! Don't these guys change their clothes? Even at a party they wore the same shirt and tie! Then they go to work in the same shirt and tie.I wish these guys would have traveled back in time and killed themselves because maybe this torturous movie would not have been made.
3,Sorry but I went to sleep on it!,"This is truly a concept movie, about limited time travel.It tests Einstine's theories of time and space, in a very novel way. The Pardox! If I do this, then what is the out come?, butif I do this in a different way, will the out come be the same,of different?This is why I went to sleep on it! I couldn't keep up withwhat was going on with the plot.This movie is strictly for grad students majoring in quantumphysics, and temperal theorum."
4,Four and a half stars,"Basically this movie blew me away. The fact that Shane Carruth, who had no screenwriting, directing, or acting experience wrote, directed, starred, and SCORED this film and made the whole thing for $7000 is almost too much to believe. I would give it 5 stars, but the first time I saw it I missed the first 10-15 minutes, and when I bought the film I realized that the movie could have done without most of it."
3,Uh,"Uh, not sure I would recommend this. Being a geek (software engineer / electrical engineer), I could relate to a lot of it, but I doubt that it would get wide acceptance. It tries to hard to be ""difficult"". Kinda like the ""Numbers"" show on TV. The appearances are there, but people in the know discard it as simply Hollywood getting in over their heads. The take-offs from the ""Matrix"" are noticeable, even if dismissed as being different. Just not good enough to recommend."
5,Shel - A great group!,"I've heard these ""girls"" in person and they are incredible - the real deal. Sweet, considerate, talented, and interesting to hear. Great music- pop music that isn't offensive."
3,Watch out for short-wave radio noise,"I have had this charger for 2 years, and it charges the battery with no problems. (Mine is perhaps an older version, the battery connector is grayish, not brownish as the picture here appears.) Anyway I noticed that mine puts out noise across pretty much the entire short-wave band, especially if you leave it connected to the battery after charging is finished. Not a problem for most people, but if you use short-wave radio you will want to unplug this device."
5,12 volt charger,"This charger charged my son's power wheels within 3 hours to a full charge! Our orginal charger took about 12 hours to fully charge, but it quit working so we are so excited to have his truck driving again. I am very pleased with this product and the price I received!"
2,One ventvisor has defect,"One of the ventvisors has a factory defect and a small scuffed place. Didn't notice until it was installed. Going to keep them, but disappointing...."
2,"Should Have Been Titled ""Vacancy 3""","Terror Trap is a pointless horror flick that borrows completely from Vacancy and Hostel. The movie tells the story of a bickering couple that wind up in a backwoods motel, where they are terrorized by sadistic men as their ordeal is caught on camera for others.The movie is painfully unoriginal, filled with tedious dialogue, and is riddled with plot holes. Michael Madsen, easily the best-known actors in the film, phones in his performance for an easy check. Jeff Fahey turns up the volume on his performance as one of the film's bad guys, but neither his performance nor Madsen's are enough to salvage the movie.Once in a while, I discover a hidden gem amongst low-budget horror flicks that go straight to video. Terror Trap is not one of them. It's not worth a rental, so I can't imagine why anyone would actually buy the DVD. If you're a diehard fan of Jeff Fahey, or wouldn't mind a Vacancy rip-off, it's worth a watch. Otherwise, renting it is a complete waste of time."
2,it keeps breaking!,"I got my Zire 71 as a Christmas Gift. I absolutely loved it, however, it malfunctioned in March (a problem with the digitizier). I had barely used it and it stayed on my desk for the most part. Palm sent me a replacement unit because it could not be repaired. In May it malfunctioned the exact same way again! Once again, Palm is sending me a replacement unit.You do have to be careful with the power button...the battery drains very quickly. The case it comes with tends to turn it on when you slide it in.I wish I could get a refund...I will never buy another Zire again. I asked Palm for a refund and they told me ""a refund is not an option."""
1,Get a Dell or viewsonic pocket PC,"Great little PDA with a fatal flaw. The little joy stick protrudes so it gets turned on in almost any case you may have, this runs down the battery. Also very fragile just a short drop and the screen will break.The camera is a gimic cute at first but pictures are really to low quality (mainly from camera shake, who can hold the thing still) to be more than a curiosity.Pocketpc's are coming down in price and have surpassed the palm os. The Palms time has come and gone.If you you buy a Zire 71 you will be happy at first but sad later.Fred Frader"
1,Poorly Made,"My wife and I each bought a Zire 71 and they both failed after about a year. Makes you think the units are made to be disposible. The problem with my wife's was the battery. After a charging it would drain almost immediately. More than likely caused by the camera or joystick(she tried taping the unit shut so it wouldn't slide open but this didn't help). Mine stopped syncing and the touch screen worked eraticly. We owned other Palms which were simpler, better made and lasted longer. The Zire 71 is a disaster!"
4,It's great ... but I'm still disappointed,"This is the slickest pda I've ever owned. I bought it 2 years ago because of its great color screen. My eyes are a little weak and the hi res color is so nice! That it has a built in camera was just frosting at first but I find I use it all the time now. So why am I disappointed? You can't put the darn thing it its case without it turning on and running down the battery. I don't like carrying it around unprotected or banging in my pocket. And I don't want to add to the size and weight by getting a clunky box to put it in. I know this makes me a dinosaur but I actually like the original palms the with their tough plastic case and flip top. Of course the screens were so bad I couldn't read them. Oh, well..."
4,Excellent Palm with small complains,"This palm is feature packed! Much faster than older Palm Vx I used to have. Real colorful screen. The camera is cool! It can even play MP3 files. Though playing it without headphone is kinda weak.However, Graffiti 2 is not so good. It makes me relearn some strokes. I see nothing wrong with Graffiti 1. I have Chess Genius that needs ""/ T"" for takeback, now I cannot use this short cut because it will think you use ""/ I"" before you can finish a ""/ T"". Wish Palm will make an option to use Graffiti 1.The 5 way ""joystick"" is a bit difficult on the thumb while playing games, why can't it be a pad like other Palm models?I liked my old Palm Vx's metal stylus and the protection flap. Wish the Palm Zire 71 has it.How come there is no light in the charger/base when it has power?"
1,please read,"well i gott this thing a couple days ago and it broke the first night.not exgerating. this thing was a total jip. please dont buy this &quot;Zire 71&quot; because it is a total waste get another item, get a sony clie. but dont get this one. thank you and have a great day, unless u bu the palm."
1,PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU BUY.,1. RECEIVE PRODUCT DEFECTIVE.2. SELLER NOT COMMUNICATING ABOUT PAYMENT REFUND.3. VERY DISAPPOINTED .4. WOULD NOT RECOMENED TO ANYONE BUY FROM D.P.G
1,OLD TECHNOLOGY,Sounded like a great thing. Got it and it was 2003 technology and didn't work. I sent it back for a refund.
4,Palm Zire 71-Good,"Loved the overall workings. Was disappointed in the camera feature which would slide apart and the battery would die, I would then loose all data. Backing up was very important. I wish it had a stored memory even when the battery did die. Otherwise it was very easy to use."
3,"pda's and pocket pcs arent worth your time, unless its still 2005","most reviews on any pda, palm, or pocket pc, are at least 3 years old, this one has a slight advantage over the others, it can take picturesthese devices are good for recording, and taking notes, and calculatorsthey sell for about $10 nowyou can get a decent camera for the same priceI gave it 3 stars, becuase it has a nice designif you want wifi, you need a flash wifi card, wich sell for $15-$30 eachsave yourself sometime, get a camera, netbook, or a tablet instead."
1,"Will not seat to toilet tank, and leaks around valve.","Model includes two different gasket for the large nut connection to the toilet tank. Neither one provided a tight seal. With either, moving the hose slightly causes leaks around the gasket. Do not purchase this product.Update: They gave us a free replacement, but we just tried installing it, and it leaks around the factory installed joints around the valve. An excellent product if you want slow, accumulated water damage to your home."
1,copy Ravenloft much?,"This book bears a striking similarity, to material written for D&D. I stumbled upon this book while looking for information about the Ravenloft setting. Apparently the author decided not to change the name enough that it wasn't easily noticable. Just reading the blurb to begin with the content itself seems like the grand conjunction repackaged in a new wrapper."
1,Way under-powered,"Don't waste your money on this CD player. The volume is pre-set way too low. The music is very faint and if there is any ambient noise, such as in an airplane, train, or bus, you can hardly hear anything at all. A portable CD player that you cannot hear when you are on the go is completely useless. Some CD players are so loud that other people can hear the sound at the other end of the bus or train car despite the headphones, but even you won't be able to hear music on this model."
5,This is a cookie cookbook that everyone should own!,"The recipes are delicious and the cookie cutters are adorable. I have received many, many compliments on the cookies I have made - and I have just begun to learn how to decorate them. Tudda Libby Crews gives a wonderful history of the recipes and her life. It's a great cookie cookbook for those who want to ""experience"" the wild west!"
2,Don't do it.,"This size was wrong, it was too big and it came apart, and the paint was annoying. Go to harbor freight and get a cheap on, they are just as good, an make sure to oil it well, and be prepared to break it."
2,palmer med cookie iron,this iron makes the cookies way to thick. crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. not like the belgian cookies we made as kids. i suggest buying the thin iron. the cookies just don't taste good that thick.
2,BORING,This is probly the most boring book I have ever read. I have read alot of basketball books and by far this is one of the worst. It seemed interesting so I bought it. Then it started out all right but by page 100 I could not keep reading it I just lost interest. I would not reccomend this book.
4,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"Horror legend, Wes Craven, wanted to mix a traditional slasher film, with a who done it mystery, while at the same time parading both. The result is Scream, which turned into a much bigger film and franchise than he expected. He wanted to do this sort of under the radar, with a cast of virtual unknowns, but due to its uniqueness, the movie quickly gained popularity and today is considered one of the best horror movies of all time. The cast are all household names now and the ending of this film is legendary. Twists, turns, paranoia, accusations, one liners, and good looking people is what Scream is all about. The story is a great one, the cast is solid, and when it comes to writer/directors, you can't get much better than Wes Craven. The original Scream is one that should be on your must see list!"
1,Intriguing backdrop all but ruined by wooden prose,"The historical setting of this book with the conflict between Celtic and Roman Christianity was intriguing and realistic. You get a genuine sense for the time and place. The downfall, and it is quite a fall, is the wooden prose. I have never seen so many characters grimace. Tremayne uses the word ""grimace"" frequently, conspicously, and awkwardly. In addition, Sister Fidelma's character is one-dimensional. She isn't a medieval feminist from an enlightened society; she is just a grouch. If she isn't angry, she's irritated, impatient, insulted, or otherwsie bothered. Once in a while she is pleasant, but then she grimaces and your back to square one. The plot is crafted well enough, though the murderer wasn't hard to guess. In sum, this might be worth a single read, but I wouldn't search for the hard cover version."
3,"Skip the first book, read the later ones.","Sister Fidelma's first outing is disappointingly predictable even for someone like me who doesn't try particularly hard to guess the murderer. I recommend ""The Subtle Serpent"" as a better introduction to the series, which does indeed have more redeeming features than are evident from ""Absolution By Murder."""
3,Nice portable fire pit,This copper fireplace looks beautiful when first used; then the copper sheen completely disappears and a dull charcoal film covers the entire fireplace. Ours was rained on a few days later and it now has a very dull gold color coming through the charcoal. We are assured the copper color will reappear with a brass polish cloth. We'll see.Other than that the portability of the fireplace is great and we love the outdoor opportunity for a fire and conversation pit.
1,"""bummed""","I am way disappointed in these sheets I just got them and read the instructions on how to wash them and I did so, I put them on my bed and they feel like paper. I thought they were supposed to be soft???? they are 800 thread count but I am new at this. maybe if I keep washing them they will get better"
3,Plus a half a star for this second volume,"As much as I enjoy a lot of the female artists featured in this volume, I cannot say I enjoy it as much as the first volume. The music does not have the variety of the first volume and that is where my disappointment comes into play. I was so looking forward to the nice blend of pure flute to modern and I did not get it. I love Walela's version of Amazing Grace, but it is on their own album and nothing new. However, if you do not have that album - Walela - then by all means buy this alumn just for that alone. All and all, if you enjoy Native American music, you most likely will like this album. If you are looking for a nice blend of different NA sounds, this isn't it. It IS good, just not great."
2,Max weight less than listed,"I bought a lightweight tripod with this head on it for hiking trips. It does a good job until I switch to my 100 mm macro lens; then it cannot hold the weight and slips slowly out of position, even though I torque it down as tight as I can. I weighed my camera with the macro lens, it weights 3 lbs, 1.5 oz. The specs say 3.5 lbs is the maximum load. I'd say that is high-balling this ballhead's true capability."
5,how did this lay dormant for 30+ years?,"hmmm... she does have a joni mitchell thing about her, but more like if joni and nick drake spent the winter writing songs together. then there's a grace slick feel, with a proto-ann-and-nancy-wilson groove. and yoko ono came by the studio one day. maybe. i mean all of this in the best way possible. this should have been a record famous for its innovative blend of folk and psychedelia. i don't know why it's been buried for so long. linda perhacs' voice is beautiful. buy it."
2,ONLY 3 ITEMS WORKED!,"Nasal aspirator (which is amazing), nail clippers and brush... that's the only items that worked. At the middle of the night, my 3m-old baby had a fever.. thermometer never worked, I had to use the family's one. After confirming fever and a quick call to the nurse, had to give him some medicine... but using the syringe was a NIGHTMARE and a big mess with medicine leaking all over the baby and all over my hands!! WE ended up using a spoon (not the one in the kit, which shows ml by halves like 1 1/2, 2 1/2, 3 1/2 and so on.. and didn't want to guess where the 2ml mark was) I had to buy health care items separately. It was a little more expensive than the kit, but now I'm sure everything in the health care box works!"
4,You gotta love it...,"West Bank Story is the gem of this collection, but there's more on the disc as well. Truly tongue-in-cheek, anyone with a sense of humor should love this short, though I could imagine so much more that could have been done.... just imagine how this would have sounded (to the of ""When you're a Jet"");When you're Hamas,you're Hamas all the way...From your first I E D,to your last dying day.....Recommended!"
1,You get what you pay for,"I purchased this car charger through Amazon for one reason - the price was much better than at Verizon. I discovered that you get what you pay for! The charger worked for two weeks, then stopped working. Next time, I will pay the money and get a quality product."
1,Defective Software,"The drive is actually pretty easy to install. No problems there. But when I tried to install the software that came with the drive, I ran into problems. The software will not complete installation on my Compaq Presario 5304. It unpacks some support files, and then just hangs there at the blue screen. The drive will read computer disks and audio CD's but if I try to write anything, it tells me I need to install the software. When I tell it to go ahead and install the software, it does the exact same thing, EVERY TIME, which is to unpack the support files and then hang there doing NOTHING. This has been a nightmare so far. I've spent good money and all I can do is stare helplessly and hope that Hewlett Packard tech support will be able to help (and I don't put much faith in tech support). This has been an awful experience."
5,We Are All In the Parable,"Fresh, incisive study of the parable of the Prodigal. Everyone will find themselves somewhere in this book. Another work of word art from the heart of one who found his true self."
2,Sadly disappointed,"I wanted to like this book as it is so highly praised by people I admire. It was a selection for our church book club and I'm glad I had exposure to Father Nouwen's interpretation of the message of the Prodigal Son, one of my favorite New Testament passages. Unfortunately it did not arouse much spirituality in me. I felt that Father Nouwen overworked the connectedness between his own experiences and the biblical message. It was a long slog to finish the book which engendered guilt in me for not being more moved by Father Nouwen's words. He was a dedicated and thoughtful Christian who lead an exemplary life of charity and service but his message here was diminished by repetition. Prudent editing would have resulted in a more readable and inspirational book."
4,More Than a Tale of Forgiveness,"This book dives into the Gospel parable of the prodigal son and into Rembrandt's depiction of the parable (as the book points out, the painting is not 100% true to the Gospel and there are reasons for this). Interesting facts of Rembrandt's ""prodigal"" life are examined, but more importantly the author examines his own actions and attitudes, which leads the reader to do the same. This book has helped me realize we are indeed all prodigal children who can return home to a loving Father anytime we choose."
5,"The clearest, truest explanation of what God is really like.","I hadn't cared for Nouwen's books particularly before this one. This one is, I believe, inspired, touching the heart and very Spirit of God. The whole of God's message, really, all from a single poignant story originally told by Jesus. This is a book for everyone, but most especially it's for men. For all of us underachievers and overachievers, screw-ups and good boys, with wounds so deep (and often father-inflicted) that they aren't spoken of but usually carried to the grave. This book describes with rare clarity and wisdom (and no BS) the beyond-human love that alone can bind up all those wounds. It came at a pivotal time for me and became an important touchstone in my faith walk. I have given several copies to friends in need (buying two more today). I hope it can be a similar lifeline or burst of sunshine for you or your loved one."
4,"Good Interface, Soundcard","I bought the 1394 interface a couple weeks ago, and it sounds really good. I don't have any problems recording my music. I think this is a good quality product, ( cheapest I could find ) Surprised!"
1,So bad it's... it's unbelievable!,"This is the number one worst movie i have ever seen! It looks like it was shot with a home video camera! I would give it 0 stars unfortunalty i can't beacuse the system won't let you. The acting is TERRIBLY BRUTAL! The plot could have been something. Kills were awful, fake. Anything that is bad describes THIS awful movie. Unfortunatly i will never get that hour and a half of my life back. The only reason i finished wathcing it (can't believe it) is to see the kills (to see if they got better) but nope. and once you start watching a movie to see the kills you know that the whole thing is crap. Now i wrote this review so no one will make the same mistake i did, so please don't watch it, it's for your own good.-5/5 stars."
1,WORST MOVIE,I just bought this movie and its a total joke my buddies who made independant movies have done a better job of a slasher movie did better the acting was a joke and it seemed like more the movie kept going it made no sense.. It should be a promo movie given to people not even sold in stores... Only thing good was the cute girls thats it...
3,"good idea, but...","I thought this was an excellent idea for an exercise DVD. I love high heels but am chronically tripping and stumbling in them.This DVD offered some good tips the best way to walk to maximize comfort, it also had some good exercises.Overall, after a few weeks of doing this, I don't feel like I am any better at walking.Also take notice, that it is a very short DVD, and does not have a variety of special features.I don't feel like I got very much for my money."
2,Poor fidelity and poor programming,"I bought this item because I wanted a 2-line digital answering machine. I was very disappointed in the audio fidelity, but even more so in the programming. For example, both by phone, and on the face of the unit, it is not easy to erase calls. Comparing the programming to other units I've used, or your local Bell answering service, the speed of use is lacking. I don't have a suggested alternative, but I am not ready to see this is a good product."
4,Great frame great price,Simple design simple price. I would buy again for multiple rooms in the house. Material seems to be above average quality.
4,Find the bug and worm on each page.,"My 2-year-old daughter loves this book. I'm disappointed it's out of print. There is simple text with only a rhyming line of text on each two page spread. The illustrations seem to be collages of condstruction paper cutouts. Unlike the other Everyday ___ titles by Rylant we've seen and enjoyed, this one has an added bonus the ""round bug"" and worm appear on each two page spread. She really enjoys finding them each time we reread it.The board book seems sturdy and is larger than average which gives you larger pictures to attract the kids' attention. Our library's copy is popular nad well-circulated so she's obviously not the only preschooler who wants to read it. I give it four stars instead of five because it's not a ""must have"" for every child's library, but if your child likes bugs, gardens, or ""find it"" games then they might enjoy this book."
5,Great way to pass along heritage to next generation!,"A Grandparent's Journal (Interactive Journals)This book offers an organized way for grandparents to give history and other family ""trivia"" to the next generation. I am sorry it is out of print and was delighted to find copies thru Amazon at [...]. The books arrived on schedule. However, edges were dented - but usable. The worst copy was a very FADED one - so that at first glance I thought it was an entirely different book. But the inside pages all seem to be there and usable - so I have sent them off to friends who are new grandparents. This is a great way to make your own personal connection to the next generation and I think needs to be encouraged more - as we move about and tend to rely on technology too often now days. Hand written notes from a grandparent can be priceless treasures in future."
4,"Anything from original, but still good","I must say even though this movie isn't original at all, it's still a pretty entertaining movie that doesn't drag. Good kills, especially the shower kill. This movie keeps you watching, but it has ALL the cliches of all slasher films. The (...) girl, the two guys 'challenging' each other, the 'huh huh i scared you' thing. Still a fairly good movie tho"
2,"Stupid storyline, actors looked too old and the naked girl",This movie was stupid. The old JASON movies are alot better.The story was boring. They all could have left along time before everyone dies.BUT for a cheap movie it didn't LOOK too bad.They had one token girl for a couple nude scenes that should have kept her clothes ON (Ms. Shepis)Don't waste your time with this film
3,Good but not good,"THe movie is good , but the killer in this movie is nothing like hte first film , It was an ok film it had some good nudity but the story is kinda horrible. I recomend it to people who like to collect masks killer movies , like me . Good movie but rent before you own."
5,Comfort Plus,"My husband was totally delighted with his new Sanuks, the fit is exactly as described! Fantastic service with great product"
2,Disappointed,I bought these Sanuk's for my 11 year old son (first pair) he was so excited when he got them. The comfort is great but on these the front sole has seprated. It has a big gap and I have tried to mend it with glue which lasted one school day. Love the brand but disappointed they fell to pieces so quick -(
5,soooo comfy,very comfy shoes you can wear with or without socks. Also can pass as dress shoes. Very happy with purchase.
5,Comfy and happy feet,"Had seen these in retail stores and seems like everyone likes them so I ordered off amazon and saved$15. Great for these hot summer days and seem to be well built for what it is. You may want to order a size larger than normal, they seem to run small"
2,too hot,"Title says it all. I really wanted to like these. They're super lightweight and very comfortable, but just wearing them around the house for a half hour in bare feet, my feet were sweating. They might be great with socks, but I bought them specifically for the summer to wear in bare feet. Returned them the same day."
5,Eerily accurate... explained a lot too!,"I first picked up this amazing book back in '97, and out of curiosity I looked up my comaptibility with an older (by 14 yrs) man I had a major crush on. I didn't know why I had a crush on him, but after reading about the cards between us, I got chills! We had Venus cards between us, and that meant that we had most likely been lovers in a previous life! After that I was hooked! It explained why I had the crushes I did (usually because of strong Venus connections) and why I had animosity toward certain people in my life (Mars connections, which meant we were probably enemies in a past life too!) This book is fantastic! It explains so much. Robert Camp really knows what he's talking about!"
3,Low Video Quality,"I really enjoyed this show in its original run on Fox 2 decades ago. I also noticed the lower video quality -- probably a result of cramming too many episodes on each disc. Other shows use 3 or 4 episodes per disc, but this set has twice that number on each disc. It looks better when viewed through standard video hookups versus HDMI.Additional - Many of these episodes are just not the same without the music used when they originally aired: The Rolling Stones, Depeche Mode, REM, Blind Faith. The distributing company did not get the music rights (for whatever reason), so music tracks have been substituted with cheesy studio band music in a bad 80's style. It really changes the tone of some episodes. The music was so much better when the showed originally aired on Fox."
5,"just the right price, just the right quality","this product was easy to order, easy to receive and easy to enjoy. Thanks Amazon for the great and easy way to enjoy JohnnyDepp and this program."
4,My daughters order,"I'm cery happy with the DVD-discs, their quality etc., my daughter was delighted!However the box was broken as it was the last time we orded DVD's. It seems that you have a problem with the containing boxes but the dvd's are of excellent quality.I would very much appriciate if you could send me 2 empty boxes but othervise we are quite happy.Best regardsPer"
1,Where is the Last episode in season 4!??!?,"It's nice to see in season 4 part 1 of ""Wheels and Deals"" but where is Johnny Depp's last episode ""Blackout""?? Wish it was there instead of having to watch in on Hulu. It's a good deal for all the episodes though...."
5,Great to watch,"Has everything ...the whole series, love Johnny Depp they are all great...but he is wonderful. Loved sharing with my granddaughter...She had only known him from Pirate Movies...Know loves hi, ."
2,Buttons????,"The backside of this sham has BUTTONS running down the middle of it. Big buttons. When you stuff a pillow in this sham, make sure it's thick...or you'll feel the buttons. Forget about trying to sleep on this thing. If you accidentally turn the sham over while sleeping, you'll wake up with button marks on your face.Who puts buttons on their shams? Unreal."
4,Very nice Monitor for the price,"Someone said it was poor quality, I disagree. It's not the best money can buy but its sure isn't bad. I have mine hooked up via the digital connectors. It seems a little dimmer than my 17"" but the display of text is very clear and easy to read, even very small font sizes. Of course the colors are displayed fantastically. I do a lot of graphics and video work and I haven't had to do anything to get screen colors to match my print colors. It's thin and very stable and I'm really happy with mine."
1,Crappy thin exhaust flanges,"Installed and as i tightened flanges they bent and caused leakage on new copper OEM Honda exhaust gaskets. Pretty flismy. And to loud, need a little baffle for good loud pipes, Other wise stick with factory pipes. CObra Lousy Engineering and they will not make it right"
4,No Problems,"I have owned this printer since 1999. I am still using it. It has never given me any trouble. Of course it is slower than the new printers out there, but I mostly print in black and white draft mode, and that is fast enough for me."
2,A run of the mill printer,"There is really nothing ""great"" about this printer. The ink is [costly] and hard to find. It is noisy and slow. The output is decent. I recieved my printer from Dell as a freebie when I purchased a new system. I really wish that I had paid the extra money to upgrade to a higher quality product."
2,SHEESH!,"I really think this printer stinks! It's slow, bad quality, loud, and it requires you to feed the paper by hand each time! 4 words for you: DON'T BUY THIS PRINTER!!!"
2,"Fair, but probably not worth it.","I bought this refill kit for my oldest printer, the Canon which takes BC-02 cartridges. My thought was that it would be environmentally friendly and inexpensive. The price was right, and it arrived quickly from Office Depot. But, it's messy, and the ink is difficult to get off (ie., from fingers). Also, the print quality was good, but there were some incomplete areas which required additional cleaning to improve. Lastly, there probably is less to throw away overall; but, the ink holder, the tools and the box itself likely add up to as much waste as the original cartridge. So, next time I plan to buy a remanufactured cartridge and recycle my used one (at Staples for a credit).(P.S. The ink clogged and stopped working about 1 month after I used this product. I would not buy this again.)"
3,My Father's War,Knew the parents. Very sad story. Never would have believed this all could have happened to such bright well educated people.
2,need more then what is shown,"The system itself is probably the best thing on the market, except that you need a $100 adapter to spray the fluid in the intake. Buy the one titled ""Do-it-yourself"" for a couple of bucks more."
5,"believable, readable, and entirely possible","Chasing the Cosmic Wind is a story written much in the style of L'Amour or King. One stays glued to the plot, even when doing other things. It is believable, readable, and entirely possible. Who can say what lies just over in the next milennium? Greg Shelton is a dynamic racounteur"
4,I Feel Great,First off I have to say I did not buy this DVD. I bought several disks from company and they gave this to me free. Sometimes the production seems a little more could have been put into it. If you are looking for a big budget disk this is not it. It teaches quite a few ways to meditate (focus the mind). I never meditated before but I have to say I have not felt so good in a very long time. I feel more with it than I have felt in years. The 4 stars is a mixture of 2 1/2 stars for DVD and 5 stars for the meditation itself. If you are a little older I would recommend learning. It is easy. I am more aware. I feel my blood pressure has gone done (not tested yet). I am more relaxed. I recommend meditation whole heartedly.
4,Great Adapter,This adapter works wonderfully! Struggled for a few hours but once I got in touch with D-Link support and discovered my D-Link Wireless Router needed its Firmware updated. Once this was done then the device came up immediately.Be careful to have your wireless routers firmware current BEFORE trying to connect this device to your wireless network!
5,mr,this adapter is really great the speed i clock it with my cable connection got 5m up and 20m down. Pretty fast but if the price can be lower will be better. Installion is very easy!!!
4,"Configuration via browser is poor, but solid once configured.","The browser-based configuration of this unit is poorly thought-out and buggy, but once configured, it's solid.For example, you can't skip the setup wizard and just jump to the advanced settings. And you can't set WPA via the wizard. So you have to run the wizard first, and select WEP or open mode, complete the wizard, and then go to the advanced options and set WPA. It mysteriously took many attempts before the settings were actually saved.Once I finished the configuration, the unit connected to my D-Link DWL-7100AP access point using WPA-TKIP, and has been operating for about a week now without interruption. I am using it with the XBOX Media Center Extender, and it's been able to keep up with streaming audio and video."
5,Perfect,"Thank goodness this arrived. The quality and price was what I have grown to expect from Amazon! Thank you so much for supplyihng this ""odd"" sized bulb."
3,Good for research purposes,"Good for readers who like to do their reading in the Italian language, but would like to learn more about the authors and the movements they participated in through an English volume. I'm a fan of Fallaci and Ginsburg and learned much about them as women that I had not known from reading their books."
3,From ancient Carthage to CIA - a transcontinental thriller,"Flying from Tunisia back to the United States probably put me in a good frame of mind to appreciate this novel. An archaeological dig in the ancient city of Carthage, close to the capital of present day Tunisia, leads to a thriller involving politicians and intelligence services from Tunisia, the United States, and France. With increased U.S. attention to the Middle East these days, this novel might interest many Americans attracted to this genre. Unfortunately, to my knowledge, it has only been published in French, which might limit its accessibilty."
1,WE'RE NOT GANGSTERS,"Tony (Simon Paul Sutton) and Steve (Ben`Doc Brown'Smith) deal drugs in England. They are underachievers who wants to be legitimate event managers. They use the drug trade to make contacts with people...people who wouldn't hire a drug dealer to be their event manager. Both Tony and Steve have girlfriend issues. Tony sees the drug trade as a dead end and wants out.After an incident Tony's world falls apart as he becomes indebted to the mob. The acting was acceptable, but the story lacked a decent hook. It was difficult to feel for Tony our main character who really didn't have much of a character at all. Nothing worth seeing.F-bombs, no sex or nudity."
3,USB versus FireWire; VST versus everyone else,"A great little HD, but when thinking of a FireWire drive (VST also makes a nearly identical HD using FireWire) go with FireWire. While this is a small drive, it is dependent upon an AC adapter to run, while the FireWire version does not need a power supply. Nearly all new computers are being shipped with FireWire support, both desktops and notebooks. VST has great support and make a very durable product-- If a USB drive is a must, I would suggest this brand over any other."
5,Very useful for the guitar soloist,"I really like this book, and it is far more useful than any other ""guitar lesson"" books out there. The book is a collection of Satriani's monthly lessons which he submitted to a guitar magazine over several years. The lessons are short - varying from about half a page to three pages each - but they will keep you busy. I recommend taking your time. Spend at least a month on each lesson, as was intended by Satriani.If you are interested in guitar solos (who isn't?), you will love this book for what it will do to your knowledge and perspective of the guitar.Happy strumming!"
4,Multivariate statistics also for dummies,"Accessible introduction to multivariate statistics, also for those afraid of equations. Aimed more at practical understanding than at mathematics. Examples tend to get boring but help those who got lost. Changing the order of the chapters (compared to previous edition) not necessarily a good idea."
4,Blues Jamming at it best,This is a great DVD for blues lovers. The guitar solos played by Mick Taylor alone are worth the price of the DVD. I had never heard of Sippy Wallace but at 80 plus years old she sure does a fantastic job singing the blues. Mayall and the blues breakers bought the house down.
1,It's just not,"This piece of equipment i can't really say much about because i actually never got to using it. When i received this product,i immediately went to install it. From the very get-go it was extremely complicated. In order to install it i had to remove the computer screen and so i was like ok, i really dont know how to do that. So i called my brother and his friend who work IN the computer field and both of them said that in order to install it, you had to remove the hard drive. And thought to myself that's insane. So we made a few phone calls to see if a professional would install it and he said he would but it would cost a good $80. And so we figured we freakin spent ... for it to begin with and thats more than half the price of the entire writer. So we're like ok, forget this and we just got an external writer now that works and installs perfectly. My advice is skip the internal, and go for the external. Yeah it cost more money but in the long run its a much better investment."
1,VERY UNSATISFIED,This product worked well at first. The sound was great and it was easy to understand. I battery power was long lasting but it didn't even last 3 months of regular usage. It stopped working for no reason. Now it doesn't even turn on. This player just .... Don't buy this junk.
1,i've had this same problem,I had mine for two days & then the sound went out. don't buy this player!
4,No Problems with Audio Books !!,"i got one of these through a book club and i haven't had any problems...i see all these poor reviews and wonder if there was a BAD lot...this player is easy to use and about the only minor problem is you should really purchase the optional battery backpack which gives you more memory and a recharger....i will say i haven't downloaded songs on to this player, i only go to my book site and listen to books so maybe there are problems with mp3 listening that im not aware of...if you are reading this because you are thinking of signing up for the book club, then don't hesitate, as far as the books are concerned, i am very satisfied with this product."
3,Great... if its free!,"I received my Rio 600 for [price] (a refurbished one) when I signed up for a years [store]. I use it exclusively for [store] books. It holds about 6 hours at a time. For back and forth to work, its great. My Rio does not restart every time I shut it off. It resumes from where I was. Setting a bookmark though proved to not work. It does set me back to zero, so I just shut off. Two major complaints. The foldup headphones look good, but hurt my ears. I'd prefer something softer. Secondly, the single AA battery compartment is shabby. Occasionally the Rio won't turn on, although I get no low battery warning. I just open the case, and reinsert the same battery. Voila! Doesn't happen too often. The battery lasts about 6 hours, which is good for me. Wish I had a cassette player in my car! Mine came with the adapter, but I only have a CD player. Like I say, if its [price], the quirks are quite livable!"
1,Premature Termination of Tracks,"At least two other reviewers here have posted about the problem of some Rio 600 units abrupting ending the play of a track before reaching the tend. Despite these warnings, and consoled by the large number of positive reviews, I took the chance and bought a unit from the local store of a large national clicks and mortar electronics chain. Sure enough, my unit exhibited the same behavior; of the three MP3 tracks I tested, ranging from six to eighteen minutes, all would end after less than a third of the track had been played. A repeat download of one MP3 did work, so the problem seems sporadic. Despite a nice design, the execution is flawed. Who wants a well-designed can opener that opens a can only part way? I returned the unit."
1,D.O.A.,"Dead on Arrival --Shouda listened to the other reviewers... Rio support was just ducky...said, ""for $29.95 we can replace it"" even though I had it only for 2 hours...oh well. I was able to return it through Apple..."
1,Disapointed,"I purchased Rio 600 last summer. I did not mind getting only 32MB because I was lured by Diamond's promise of 340MB backpack. Rio 600 is small and stylish and 372MB of memory would make it an ultimate player. However, five months past and Diamond still has not released any of backpacks 32MB, 64MB or 340MB. Later it became clear to me that Diamond abandoned 340MB backpack.Software program for is adequate but it might take time for users to get used to it. File transfer was fast and reliable using USB connection .My unit functioned flawlessly but I need more than 32MB. I sold Rio 600 last month on auction.If your are in market for MP3 player I strongly discourage you from buying Rio 600 or Rio 800. Personally I am going to take look at Iomega HipZip and Nomad N-64"
5,Great product,"Check this out: 1.You can pump up the audio playtime with snap-on backpacks up to 372MB(separately)! 2.Personalize RIO 600 with snap-on faceplates. 3.Fashionable design. 4.Uses USB to transfer your MP3s to RIO 600. 5.Large LCD screen. 6.Simple user interface. 7.The RIO 600 plays MP3 and WMA files, and can be upgraded to support future digital standards. It's the best MP3 player you can get now!"
1,Not Good at ALL!,"I think that this player is not good, i am 13 years old, and i wanted this player so bad!!! When i got is it worked for a day, then broke, it ruined my weekend. I soon got another one, because i thought the first one was defective, it once again did the same thing, after i finished crying my mom bought online, a different type. She bought a Nomad 64MB, i have never been happier, i love it, and even though it cost a little bit more, it was worth it. Dont buy it."
3,So so,"I bought this product last year. I was very satisfied with it for a while. But, I must tell you, you can only put 30 minutes or less music. If you exercise and want to listen the music, it is not enough. (at least for me). In addition to it, a battery goes deat so quickly. I have constantly changing batteries all the time. If you want to buy this product, I would recommend that you buy additional back memory and battery."
3,"The Good, The Bad,& The Ugly",The good: The Price! I found it on sale brand new for 100.00 Also good is the player itself. The sound quality is on par with digital cd sound. The Bad: 32mb of storage makes it inconvenient for some one who likes to hear a variety of music daily. Formating and making a new playlist every day is too much hassle. Also bad is the expensive backpacks that can upgrade your storage to as much as 340mb. The Ugly: The software. Many have reported having no problem using it. So I thought I would give it a chance. After three days of frustration I am going to take back this player solely because the program is riddled with bugs that I could not iron out. Customer support is basically non-existant.
4,For all those who have tried,"I found the book to be enormously entertaining. As others, I found myself laughing out loud as Mr. Newport writes of his journey. For all those who have played golf competitively at any level, this is a must read. For us weekend warriors who find ourselves choking under the pressure of $2 putt at our favorite golf course, the author lives our fantasy. Read this book, you'll love the game alittle more because of it!"
1,"Love snap caps, but worthless with certain model rifles??","It could be the model ak that i have (wasr). But i have now read on other web sites that snap caps are worthless on ak's. Now i know from first hand experience. The cap would get stuck in the barrel and it was difficult to pull the charging handle back. (and others have had the exact same experience, so it isnt just me) I was really surprised since i have used snap caps to help familiarize myself with other firearms over the years before i actually took them to the range. In other calibers of hand guns and rifles the snap caps work great. but dont bother with this particular caliber."
4,Super cute movie for kids and adults alike!,"We held off seeing this movie thinking it might be too mature for our almost 6 year old twins (boy and girl), but after reading the reviews here we decided to give it a shot -- and were pleasantly surprised and delighted at how much our whole family enjoyed it! As others have stated, this movie is pretty much a clean, goofy and feel-good kid comedy. Just what we were looking for. I highly recommend this movie if you're having a family movie night and are looking for a film that will please everyone."
5,Judy Moody,My granddaughter and I loved this movie. Plan on buying it soon. it is a good family movie that you don't have to worry about the content or language being inappropriate.
5,Cute FUN movie!,I loved this movie it was fun and funny for kids and even for mommies! I'm surprised some reviews were bad.
1,Speech impediment and vomit,"This movie had so much potential. The Judy character is well cast, and the story is pretty fun. But for some reason they cast a boy with a speech impediment as Stink. I think we've read all the books, and there is no mention of speech problems. I can't figure out why the film makers would have wanted to add this; it makes it hard to watch. And we thought the vomit scene was unnecessary for a kids' movie. Unfortunately, these are the two points we remember most about the movie."
2,"Ok for very young girls, I guess....","Very young girls may like this, but prepare to be bored if you're over 12 and not a girl. The plot never seems to leave first gear - the engine keeps revving high but never goes anywhere."
4,great movie for kids,i bought for my daughter for christmas last year and she loves it. she will watch this movie over and over again.
3,"Some jokes that can still be aired, others best left sealed","This ""dictionary"" is based on wordplay and in many ways demonstrates the different mindset of the years at the start of the twentieth century. Humorous definitions are put forward for many words and these definitions are a look back to that time. The author takes a stab at wealth, the ownership class, the minds of women, foreigners and minorities. Some examples are:Money - society's vindication of vulgarityMine - a hole in the ground owned by a liarIntuition - a fictitious quality in females - really suspicion.Adore - from add, annex, and ore, meaning wealth. Example, foreign nobles who marry American heiresses adore them.Negro - one who votes your way N****r - one who doesn't.If you have an interest in the comedy of a century ago, then this book may interest you. There are some jokes that are still worthy of airing, however, many are best left sealed."
3,Fair Player,"After following Consumer Reports recomendation I bought this player. It's not bad, but lack some basic features. For example: You can't select or deselect random while a disc is playing, it's reading of less than perfect discs is poor, you can't select random from within User groups. These are all desired features that I would have liked. Otherwise it's a decent player"
1,Doesn't Fit All Power Wheels 6 Volt,The description of this product is very poor and I bought the charger with all intentions of using it on my son's Power Wheels 4 wheeler. It does not fit and now I am stuck with this charger.
1,Didnt last three months very disappointed,The charger worked great for the first three months my grandson comes to my home every wednesday and he drives his powerwheels truck so the charger was used once a week after about three months the battery was not charged so I took the truck and charger in to the powerwheels service center the guy tested everything and determined it was the charger. So now I just charge the truck the day before and my grandson only gets to ride until the battery dies as it takes 14 hours to recharge
5,"skip tracks 5 & 9, and it's perfect!","This is a great album, all the musicians on it sound fantastic, Charnett in particular is amazing. But the spoken word pieces on tracks 5 and 9 just killed the album for me, just painfully bad. I made myself a copy of the CD, skipping those two tracks, and that way it's perfect. Track 7, The Shepherd, has an irresistible playful dancing quality.Highly recommended, but beware the spoken word pieces...!"
4,Good crop,Its a crop. I honestly have know idea how well it works for riding. Decent product. Feels durable. Long handle.
2,its pretty good but not as a burner,i got this drive and installed itit wouldnt even burn one cd for meafter messing with it the software wouldnt workit works pretty good now but as a second cd-rom
1,Short on History & Genealogy,"This is basically a list of the men in the RIC and a very, very brief outline of the history. It illuminates little about the historical context of the RIC and gives no real information about the men. Not recommeneded unless you just want to find a name in the list."
1,Returned,Unit was DOA. I could not get this unit to connect to my network or to a standalone PC. Tech support was useless. I returned the unit after a lot of wasted time.
2,Not so great for VoIP,"I had great hopes after readings the specs and review that this router would be resolve the issue of my Vonage calls getting impacted when there were large emails being sent/delivered, or for when I forgot to shut down the Bit torrentsI read the manual, configured the router, tested it, called tech support who were nice, but unable to resolve the issue....I imagine that for the gamers they will never know the reality of the QoS feature...but it's obvious when your voice call is impacted ...for many of you it may not be an issue, but I routinely receive 8-10 Meg files when on the phone, and it always interrupts the Vonage phone discussion...my recommendation is the ZyXEL usg20, it is a small version of a 'real router' and I found it easy to configure, and most importantly I can now receive and send huge files and have a phone discussion at the same time!"
5,Just plug and play,"If your an online xbox 360 gamer, I highly recommend this router. We have two Xbox 360s and had trouble logging onto XBLive. I made this purchase because it's an XBLive approved router. Right out of the box, plugger her in and we were set. No port forwarding, no enable PnP, no DMZ enable, no Static IP addressing. Great product. Hope it works for you as smoothly as it did for me."
5,Jewerly Travel Case,"Love it!!!!! Just the right size for traveling. Also great for young girls, daughter loves it too!!!!"
3,Wrong description... Nice watch.,"The Watch, excellent. Fossil quality, unbeatable. Product description from Amazon, very wrong. In the description to be announced for woman and when purchasing the watch is actually a man. Man? It is for women. We in return and have made the online purchase we worry that something is lost or peers. Now my wife is using a man's watch but is very happy because it has a new Fossil."
3,Acceptable for an old movie,"I agree with the others about the quality of the video but in my opinion, it's not that much different than other old movies I used to view as a kid. Personally, after 5 minutes of watching, I forgot about the quality issue and just enjoyed the movie."
1,Support?,"I bought a QPS back in April, I had configuration issues right away.I followed the tech support format and emailed them. Giving them benefit of possibly being busy or email issues I emailed four times over four weeks from seperate servers. They do not respond through support.Now the hardware failed, I repeated the email attempts with no response and have phone support three times in two weeks to give up in Cue after 45 minutes.Now I have a very high phone Bill coming and a useless QPS device that I will eat also.Please don't allow companies like this to thrive, which they all too commonly do in todays market.Buy elsewhere."
1,The description is incorrect....,"The sleeping bag is ultralite, but is NOT warm. I was cold and sleepless at 50 degrees. I wish I had spent a little more and bought similar item from their competitor."
2,A slow and unfocused read,"The local library had this book because it is by a local author; my wife gave me a copy to take on a business trip. I found Borrowed Tides a slow and unfocused read and if I hadn't been stuck in backwoods North Carolina for a couple days I probably wouldn't have finished it.The characters were not very well developed for the most part -- especially the ""kid"" with strange power -- and it looks like one character got killed off more for the convenience of the author ( who couldn't figure out what to do next) than for the needs of the plot.Worse, the ideas seemed borrowed from a lot of new age sources but they were strewn about right and left and they didn't quite connect. ... In fact the ending was the biggest disappointment -- it is definitely a cheat -- almost as bad as one of those ""it was all a dream"" things.They tell me the writer is a college professor; perhaps that's why the book is as dry as it is. Fun the book isn't. RH, NY"
1,Slipping,Levinson's quality is slipping in this disapointing second novel. He doesn't seem to know what to do with the story and quickly losses the reader's interest in this novel which could use severe editing.
1,Incredibly Bad Physics,"Other people have detailed the plot.I really liked the silk code. I enjoy fantasy mixed in with my science fiction. I completely lost it when he said:1) Making a return trip will cost twice as much fuel as a one way trip.(try many times)2) Tea brewed at 0.78G is so much better than tea at 1G because of the different pressure. (how much water in the cup has a much bigger impact on pressure)This part wasn't supposed to be fantasy. I have no problem with rudders on space ships in Stanislaw Lem. I have no problem with elves and return of the dead in Peter Hamilton. I can't deal with stuff that's supposed to be physics that isn't. Why couldn't he have asked someone to proofread his book?The story telling and language wasn't grabbing me either. I found the dialog implausible. I didn't finish. I finish about 100 books/year, so this was unusual for me."
5,a different kind of space voyage,"I found Borrowed Tides -- Paul Levinson's second science fiction novel -- very engaging and thought-provoking. It raises far more questions than it answers, but that's very satisfying too, in the end, leaving a warm-buzz itch in your mind. The pace is different from other space voyage novels that I've read. Parts of it happen in a flash; parts focus on mind-warping problems and paradoxes at great length. The truth is that we do not really know what travel to another star is like. Borrowed Tides suggests that it may be very different from what we expect. I suppose this won't be everyone's cup of tea. But it's definitely mine."
4,A Fantastic Book that Needs an Update.,"I originally bought this book when I began the saxophone and found it was a great resource. In fact, I think that in many ways it is by far the most complete and through look at the instrument. For me at least, I never had played anything other than the piano, so the book was fresh and full of things no one had even mentioned. However, I feel that it is perhaps time to update the classic. Primarily, the instrument has been brought forward so many years, and the rise of new polymers and learning techniques really hinder it being as useful as it could be. I would absolutely still buy this book and recommend it to any teacher, but I would only remind them that the sections on things like mouth pieces and reeds should be looked at as dated to a certain extent."
3,Great book but not for Kindle,"This ""Bible"" for the saxophone is a tour de force of a musician's program for making the saxophone into a serious orchestral instrument. It covers every aspect of learning to play the saxophone from the point of view of becoming an accomplished musician.Unfortunately, the fingering charts and other graphics do not transfer very well to the Kindle. I would suggest anyone buying this book get it in printed format."
2,Unhelpful,I thought this book might have some interesting ideas and case studies as to normal-people behaviour that drops people into debt; and possibly some recommendations for good financial practices. Instead it read as a parent lecturing a child on how bad their behaviour is without listening to why they were acting as they were.
5,Excellent book for general studies in fine arts,"For anyone who wants to delve into the world of art history and the fine arts, this book is a beautiful introduction. Very extensive, and even rivalling other fine arts books specializing in specific areas of the arts. I've had the good pleasure of being taught by William Fleming in college, and it was truly a life enrichening experience. This book will offer the same. I particularly enjoyed the use of psychological/sociological aspects of the arts through history to show common themes of the human psyche, however common, rare and mundane. All the art reproduced is rich with extemely good DPI, color quality, being printed on high quality paper. This book is well worth its expensive price."
5,"Durable power for power hungry electronic equipment, especially cameras.","These have never let me down, they last for a long time and seem to deliver longer-lasting power than any others I have tried."
4,Good Solid Performer,"Good performance for the money. These MAXELL AAA batteries worked just as well as the more costly ""name"" brand ones. I will buy again, as long as the price stays competitive."
5,Nice edition,"When I rate works in translation I do so based on accessibility of translation, significance of work, and any issues of accuracy I could find.Livy's work is quite significant though probably of limited historical value (as the introduction discusses). On the other hand, some philologists have found Livy's work (including Dumezil) to contain patters common to other Indo-European societies and hence probably based on earlier oral and epic traditions which do not come down to us from other sources. For comparative Indo-European studies, as well as studies into early Rome, this work is indispensable.The translation is quite accessible. Highly recommended."
4,phantastic,"Awesome book! I understand why even C. S. Lewis considered Macdonald a genius with words.As Macdonald draws wonderful pictures with words in the reader's head, I dislike the illustration on the front. But no biggie.Also, something I may be targeted for termination by Amazon for saying, this book IS freely available online on sites like project gutenberg."
3,I really WANTED to like this book,"Why did I really want to like it? I liked Greg Costikyan's earlier works (""Another Day, Another Dungeon""; ""One Quest, Hold the Dragons""). They were wacky and funny and Terry Pratchett-esque in the best possible way.""First Contract,"" on the other hand... isn't. It's not wacky, it's only occasionally funny, and the business stuff just doesn't work real well for me. Plot in a nutshell: Aliens come to Earth, wreck the economy, take Jupiter and make the world into a quaint little resort. Johnson Mukherjii's tech business is one of the casualties, so he has to... Well, I'll stop there. Suffice it to say that there's a lot of business stuff involved that the MBA-types might find somewhat more gripping than I did.Props to Mr. Costikyan for finding a fresh angle to the old first contact story, as well as for writing about something that isn't often written about. But there's probably a reason that it isn't."
2,Informational though flawed,"Eakin does a thorough job of addressing the roots of modern Brazilian society. Unfortunately, his not-so-subtle anti-American bias gets in the way on a regular basis."
1,a hidious waste of time if you are studying for the exam,I bought this book to study for the exam. But found after taking the exam that this book had no detail that the exam asked. It is ameer rehash of the books on-line material. The exam asks real life questions. The book gives no such information nor insight. a complete waste of time as an exam preperation tool.
3,Not so Interesting,It might help some serious cerification preparation.There are mostly exercises which are very boring to follow.The books are not phased to move on in a interesting way.
3,lots of horses for older kids,"this is a nice book for older kids who want many horse pictures to match with the horse name for reference. the book consists of just that.my daughter is 4 and loves horses and stickers, but the book is not well suited for her."
5,The Ultimate 4x Turn-Based Strategy Game,"Master of Orion 2 also known as MOO2 is considered the first true 4x turn based strategy game set in space. The game has a kind of cult status and even by to days standards is still only matched in game play by very few of its competitors.Features: Single Player Campaign, Multi-player Option, Hot Seat, 13 Predesigned Alien Races, Explore & Colonize, Manage Resources, Strategic or Tactical Combat, 200+ Technologies, Random Events.They just don`t make them like this any more."
5,The one to rule them all,OMGF this is a great product i have a xbox 360 a desktop and a laptop and they are all on this at the same time it is fast easy to set up for beginners and advanced users i have comcast cable internet at 16 MB per sec and with it i have created a gaming heaven no lag i repeat no lag the game fuel put priority over all internet browsing so i come before my wife well in this lets say but i was looking at the dgl-4500 but didnt wanna pay the extra 40 so i got the one step downgrade but this is the one that got the awards not the new one it must say something about this one well i got the dwa-130 for the desktop and it works like a dream with it if you are looking for that ummmm also i got the networking adapter for the xbox highly recommend that also ping time is great with it and no wires around the house (wives hate wires) this router PWNS allSigned The noob
4,a bit late for this review...,...The signal was great. It's connect to a computer on the main floor with an xbox in the basement. Gets excellent signal.
4,"Router works well, Support is week","There are only a few more things I would like to see the router do, such as SSL or HTTPS or the admin interface.Also I would love to see a router that let segment out the Wireless from the wired. But none that I have seen do that.But other than that I like this router. I like the options to open just a few ports for one or two apps and open my whole system.D-link support for 1st level is off in India some where and there fools. Lighting Strike took out my router and warranty covered it. But going the many level of hoops 1st level has you jump is not fun.Always get a case number, some India tech will tell you, you won't need one as your phone number is your case number, They LIE! Your phone number is junk. Get a case number. If you don't get one then they never enter your info into the system.Once I got to a D-link tech here in the US, they where great. It was just getting to one that sucked."
5,Great Router for gamers,I purchased this router because having major issues with game lag. Nothing is worse than going head to head with another player and getting killed because your game is lagging. Since I've installed this router I've had zero lad issues. It's really amazing how much it's helped. One thing that was not expecting is the improvements that it's made to my Vonage service. Since I've installed this router I've had no more call fade and zero lose of connectivity. As far as what some of the other writers are saying about this being a complicated router........Not true at all. It was by far easier to install and setup that any other router. This one is well worth the money.
4,1st time clay user,This book was very useful for me - and I am a first time clay user. The book was simple to understand without going over my head. Some of the projects looked a little bit dated but over all - a good book to start out with.
3,Beautiful Music for the Ballet Lover!,This CD has beautiful music for the ballet lover. The selections are varied and the orchestrations are lovely.
5,Outstanding,"The photo is out of date. What was delivered was a CLC labeled bag, not a Sierra. But don't worry because the bag itself is top of the line. This is a very stout nail bag and is actually better then the same but older model that has lasted me for years due to deeper top pockets. A Swanson speed square now fits into the top pocket perfectly. I have never found a better bag for the money. Thanks CLC for such a great product and keep up the good work!"
4,Does not smell as good as the Original but still a good lotion,It does work at keeping your tan and it does moisturize. I just like the smell of the Original Hempz Herbal Moisturizer. It's still a good product but I will stick to the orginal from now on.
5,Jean-Pierre created a masterpiece,"This is one of my favorite cookbooks, it's always the first book I reach for when I'm looking for ideas or a recipe. The best thing about the book is that all the recipes are healthy and they tast fabulous, you would never know they are low in fat. You must try the sambucca shrimp and the seared sea scallops. I highly recommend it."
5,You Can't Ask For More,"I received four Bobby Susser CDs as a gift to use with my class. After using this CD and watching how much the children in my nursery school class respond to the songs ""Wiggle Wiggle"", ""March Around In A Circle"", ""Let's Pretend"", and all the rest, I can actually feel that Bobby Susser was born to write songs for children. Here, the kids learn the importance of exercise, good health habits, basic skills, movement, and more, while being entertained. You can't ask for more than that."
2,The instructions appear to be abridged,"It appears as though the entire text of the instructions are abridged. The instructions make up a small part of this small book. Maybe only five pages. The instructions are not different than what is found online. The rest of the book talks about Vatican II and its changes, which isn't bad, but if you are buying this book you are already probably well informed on these changes."
4,"For pedestrians, not drivers","Why the hate?This map is great but you have to know what it is, it's a small POCKET map, doesn't have every detail, I wouldn't use it for driving, just subways and walking around and it's fine for that. Graphic simplicity, compactness, and userfriendliness second to none in my opinion."
3,"Interesting historically, but not the most gripping story","An interesting and detailed picture of London in the late eighteenth century. The people and the industries of the time, along with the feeling of unrest as King George worries that his citizens will revolt like the French.It took me a little while to get into the story, possibly because I wasn't particularly interested in the circus or the Astleys who owned it. I found it a little poor but it did improve and as the story developed I did grow to like Jem and Maggie, the main characters.I would disagree with the synopsis that states, ""Their friendship takes a dramatic turn when they become entangled in the life of their neighbour...William Blake."" They hardly become entangled. He's a printer, a radical and poet who just happens to be a neighbour and features briefly from time to time to give them a little food for thought.Pleasant, but not gripping."
2,Not one of Tracy Chevalier's better books,"I've read every book by Tracy Chevalier and loved each of them. I was so happy to find out she had a new release,""Burning Bright"". Sorry to say, the book is not as good as Ms. Chevalier's others. The story is dull and doesn't go anywhere. Only reason I gave this book 2 stars and not 1 is that Ms. Chevalier does an excellent job of bringing the 1792 time period to life."
3,Burning bright,"Not as good as her previous work, but still an easy ready for the beach. The story line is just not very strong and the purpose of it is fairly weak. It gets a little more interesting in the last 50 pages. However it seems a little late to me."
5,Very pleased,"My 9 year old son totally enjoys all of the Trevor Romain products. We have borrowed his books from our library and DVD's from Netflix. Now we are building our own collection. We were introduced to Trevor Romain while researaching books on stress and anxiety to help my son deal with difficult situations. My only negative comment is... since the dvd's were sold through a vendor and not amazon, I had to pay shipping on each dvd instead of one shipping charge for all three dvd's purchased"
3,audiophile does not recommend for multimedia,"Loved the monitor display but hated just about everything else. The design and layout are terrible. CD/DVD player, 2 usb inputs, headphone jack and microphone input are all on the right side of the computer. If you like using a mouse like I do, all these connections get in the way. There is no line-in input to connect audio equipment such as a tape deck or turntable. If you want to transfer old records or tapes to computer, look elsewhere. There is also no external volume control for convenience. I also do not like the feel and responsiveness of the keyboard. It is not good for fast typers.I purchased this computer to replace my old Toshiba and Sony laptops, but I find myself going back to these two for all of my audio needs. The only plus this computer offers over my other laptops is the display which is good for watching movies on DVD."
2,all fluff,"I am an avid reader and frequently run out of authors. I have reciently started getting these short story, multiple autor books to find new reads. this was the worst so far. If you are into ""fluff"" romances, then this IS a book for you. you know the bodice ripping, breast heaving type? I have no interest in checking out any other books by any of these autors."
5,enchanting music,this was one of the most enchanting cd's i have ever had the pleasure of listening to. it truly is amazingbuy it listen to it love it.
3,This was a very different book,"This book was not like any other books I have ever read before. It is about this prince that goes out to save his land and seeks out the dragons of Deltora to help him defeat the shadow lords alliances the sisters of the East,North,West, and South. He has some friends named Randolph and Jasmine. There way is going back and forth and they have a secret enemy. I didn't like the way this ended."
4,Good,My 5 year old likes it. It did not come with a battery. It does not pull off wheelie's very well.All and all it is good and fun. Kids love it.
5,"If you love toffee, this is the best","This is by far the best toffee on the market. It doesn't stick to your teeth, nor is it brittle - it is just right.If you love toffee, this will delight the senses (and it can be frozen!).Christmas just isn't Christmas for my husband without Mackintosh toffee. He grew up in the Seattle area and his parents would buy it in Vancouver BC for his Christmas stocking. It is still a part of our holiday tradition."
1,Might be a fun game if it were decently made,"My son opened the package with great excitement -- he loves baseball and was thrilled to see this toy. Unfortunately, his excitement turned to frustration within minutes as the poor quality of the product became evident. The spring-loaded ""pitching"" bar is misaligned so that the pitched ball enters the playing field only about one in twenty times. Moreover, the plastic end of the knob routinely comes off in my son's hand, leading the entire pitching mechanism to come loose from the game. The wooden tabs were misfit to the slots in the board and so the left field wall doesn't go all the way in -- the back wall was attachable with some effort but it constantly pops off.My son still likes it OK -- he just sets the ball down at the top and rolls it rather than pitching -- but overall I can't recommend this poorly-made product to anyone."
2,Get something else instead...,"This thing is a piece of junk... I received it and the edge of the homerun shelf was broken- luckily I had superglue on hand so no big deal I guess... The curve at the top of the ball shoot is not flush with the wall so 50% of the time I launch the ball is rejected off of the gap. The ball return feed is not flush, so the ball gets stuck beneath the playing surface and I have to tilt the device to get the ball out, and even then it is hard to scoop the ball out of the undersized collection area. This think is made out of cruddy mdf or particleboard and the backdrop is put together with unsightly tape.The only reason that this got two stars is because it was particularly inexpensive- and if it was worth the hassle of returning it I would.Steer clear of this product!!!"
2,Not really what I needed,"I was looking for a comprehensive introduction to workflow concepts. What this book is is hard to define. The diagrams were not conceived of for the book but rather retrofitted or adapted into the book. If you take those away, what you are left with is kindof a field report from some folks who did some work with workflow, not an intro to workflow."
5,Heavenly sleeping,"These sheets are so soft and creamy. Nice and deep too, I have a feather bed and a down comforter on my bed and they fit without any problem. I highly recommend this product."
1,Sent wrong Part,I had ordered this for my son's christmas gift along with new battery. When I got back home from business trip I find all i reved was a 110 volt standard cord and not what was ordered.I have put in to return item and now waiting for response. Depending on how this gets fixed will determine final review.
1,This is NOT an article,"All this is, is a description of a topic discussed at a seminar. There is NO value here! Why did I have to place the order to realize this? This product violates the implied warranty of ""fitness for a particular purpose"".How do I get my $5.95 back?"
2,Good salesmanship advice. Bad movie.,The first part of the movie offers insight into sales practices for which every consumer should be on the lookout. Then turn it off and save a couple of precious hours doing something else.
1,Absolute Rubbish,"Wish I could give this a negative. When I did finally get a sticker out, it wouldn't stay stuck to anything for more than five minutes. Ended up sending it back to the wholesaler as unworkable and overpriced."
1,Not worth it,"This toy is one of the most frustrating toys I and my 4 year old daughter have ever tried to use. It's a good idea, but not good execution. It's hard to get the paper in to make the stickers and you make more waste than anything usable. My daughter was so excited to use it and then got very frustrated within minutes when it didn't work. Not worth the time to set up or money. I never write reviews, but this was so bad I had to."
1,not original,ACCEL 35361 Ignition Control Module! original is not an imitation with accel label me a month to work hard and of poor quality. now my Ignition Control Module by previous generations and works best
5,Nixwax for Cloth Gazebo Cover,"Had a new 11' x 10' gazebo cover that needed some sort of UV protection (we live in Phoenix area). Ordered two bottles, but only used 1 1/2. Easy application and quick drying without spots or streaking if you follow directions. So far, happy with the product. Time will tell if the product's UV filter will lengthen the life of this cover."
2,Not The Book,"I read this book every year with my 4th grade class. This year I thought we would watch the movie and practice comparing and contrasting the book and the movie. I was very disappointed in the movie. There's really nothing wrong with it, it's just not at all close to the book. It you're looking for a cute children's movie, it's okay but it you want to see Roald Dahl's ""The BFG"" you'll have to wait for another version."
1,An Awful Movie -- Skip it,This movie was so boring that my 6 year old fell asleep on it. Read the book. It's 10 times better.
3,Easy to loose parts but effective.,"We bought this immediately after our son had RSV and was hospitalized. It is much more effective and quicker than using just the plan ""bulb"" shaped nose sucker. My biggest complaint is that there are quite a few pieces involved when cleaning it. There is also a very thin ""o"" ring that MUST be there for the item to work but it slipped out and went down the drain within the first week we owned it. Without that ring, the product is useless and they do not sell a replacement. We probably could have gone to a hardware store to get a new one - but opted to just buy a second unit. My son loved playing with it to hear the music and quickly lost a piece of the new one... Very functional, but too easy to lose the pieces. Now that we have baby #2 - we bought a different brand of the same type of thing.Make sure you use plenty of saline solution in the baby's nose and get it over as quickly as possible - they still hate it, regardless of how well it works."
4,Snot be gone,"Had initial doubts about buying this (wasn't sure if it would work), but the reviews here convinced us to try it out. Works well; we were impressed with the amount of mucus this pulled out. I would imagine the experience will vary depending on the child and the amount and type of congestion, but we are happy with this purchase."
2,"Nose sucker that doesn't ""suck""","This product is only good for the music and the fact that it doesn't scare my baby. This thing does not do what it's supposed to. I'm disappointed. This was bought because my baby had a cold, but didn't pick up hardly anything. But still, I gave it two stars because it plays music. Don't waste your money - stick to the one the hospitals give you - much more effective!"
2,"Weak suction, broke after a few uses","I used this and liked it at first, although it really didn't have a strong suction.Then it broke on me and doesn't have any suction at all anymore.Don't waste your money!"
1,Do not waste your money,"This product is horrible. Please do not waste your money on this. Our baby daughter had horrible congestion and hated the bulb sucker. I was very hopeful this product would be the answer to her congestion. Unfortunately, we were very wrong. It hardly has any sucking power at all, much less than the bulb, and our daughter cried just as much when we tried to use this on her. The music did very little to distract her. Save your money and stick to the bulb. We finally were able to use the bulb sucker with her and she now thinks it is a game. Hang in there!!!"
3,Its alright,"I really thought that this would work better than expected; however, it is rather loud and the music is just annoying. It does, however, get the boogies out rather quickly and clean up is very easy."
2,Did not include Danube!,"This Download did not include both the Rhine and the Danube. It only included the Rhine portion of the video, the Danube was not included in the download. Very Disappointing!"
2,The Twilight of Tiny Tim,"A rather disappointing foray, as by the time it was recorded, Tiny's voice was straining heavily to meet the intended octaves. Best to skip this disc and go for his earlier efforts or the live performances. If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't have purchased this CD."
5,Great Live DVD Performance Of A Classic Album,"The DVD of DREAMBOAT ANNIE LIVE is a great video of Heart's live rendition of their classic 1976 debut album, which was a unique blend of Led Zeppelin, Southern rock, and Celtic folk-rock. It's especially interesting to note that after the song ""White Lightning And Wine"", lead singer Ann Wilson tells the audience not to mix the two. If actress Michelle Rodriguez had heard Wilson's warning before driving, she wouldn't currently be serving 180 days in an overcrowded, filthy jail. She should have been required to buy both the album and this DVD, which both contain this warning, as part of her probation, because she'd have learned something from it, as could Paris Hilton. This disclaimer at the end of the song inspired me to request ginger ale instead of wine to toast my grandfather on his 95th birthday, and my grandparents on their 75th anniversary. This DVD- and the accompanying CD- are a must-own for any Heart fan."
2,"Good, but could've been so much better","And 30 years later, All of the Original Band members WERE available ... The phone just never rang ....It's amazing that after all the years, bitterness and resentment can be so deeply entrenched. Such a pity .... at least I have tons old video that keeps my memory fresh of that amazing BAND of musicians that produced sucha memorable piece of art. If they do ever make it to the R&R; Hall of Fame.No one will prevent the other four original members from being there and wemay finally get the Re-Union we as very long term fans rightly deserve."
1,Neede more,Usually I like a challenging book- it makes me feel a tiny bit superior to celebrity culture of most books one finds lining the bookshelves. But just because something is different doesn't always mean it's good. Such is the case with this book's very convuluted plot and prose. It truly is an effort that I doubt very few will be willing to wade through. It is the kind of book I suspect many at first would think they want to read- but because of the stagnant plot and too many narrative voices I'm sure most will never finish.
5,This things going to be an heirloom to my kids.,"Decent sound and straight to the point AV Receiver. I got this for my self for my 8th grade graduation....with the money I was given as a present 9 years ago. I have used and abused this thing, hooking it up to a 15"" sub and Pounded the crap out of it and also very ""uneducatedly"" hooked it up to 6 other 12"" sub woofers. I know....i was 15 at the time..give me a break. I use this almost every day (3,285 days) hooked up to my ps3(ps2 and ps1), record player and computer playing through 2 8"" PYLE bookshelf speakers. RECOMMENDED"
1,Waste of time and money,I ordered a custom dash mat for a 2000 Jeep Cherokee what I got was a two piece try to make it work dash mat. It was supposed to have been a one piece custom made dash mat. This wasn't even cut right. It wouldn't even cover the whole dash.
1,"MSPress, please get a better author","This book is a good idea: an intro book for SS2005 aimed at developers, but it is unfortunately not implemented very well. Firstly, the author obviously isn't a professional developer. The advice he gives is just plain bad much of the time. It belies a lack of experience designing and building database systems. Secondly, the book was written for one of the really early CTP versions. Much of it doesn't apply to the actual product released in November. Thirdly, the author writes with a mix of arrogance and incompetence that, while entertaining, doesn't belong in a book like this. MSPress: do yourself and us readers a favor and get a better author for the next version."
2,not large enough to fit bread or bagels,"Its toasting capabilities are OK, not the best, but the worst part is it is not deep enough to fit the whole piece of bread or bagels. They both stick out of the top some. The bagels I have to flip in order to toast the whole thing. Not much better than my $6.00 toaster that I replaced."
3,Ideal for bagels.,"Works fine. Ideal for bagels. Slot are not deep or wide enough to accommodate some breads. Purchased for reheating Belgium waffles -- not the best solution, but workable."
4,Great Workout,This workout will really make you sweat while building muscle strength. Also you have to follow this dvd for a month or more to master the quick fast boxing movements or difficult ballet positions.
5,Tire gauge,Good quality. Does the job. Well oiled when first out of the package. Also since I couldn't find them at any of the three auto stores locally it was a good value.
4,"imaginative and enjoyable ""family Friendly"" movie","More geared for a family audience, this film is imaginative and charming. Hard core kaiju fans may not like it, but the movie is great fun, filled with some great effects and an adventure filled plot that kids ( and most adults) will enjoy. Rather like films like THE GOONIES, this film has its kids caught up in an adventure, with only a few adults around to spoil the fun. Not realistic at all, but well worth seeing. To those who don't get what this film was trying to do...lighten up!!!"
3,Great Toho movie. Far from the best....,"Mothra is back! Well, at least the son(daughter?) of Mothra.......um.....or one of many Mothras.....well, the family tree is complicated. There are too many Mothras. LOL :) Good story line, good morals, and a great monster foe. The ending battle is the best part! Aqua Mothra was AWESOME! I haven't seen part 3 yet but I hear the original Kind Ghidorah returns. I can't wait! Japanese monster movies RULE!"
4,Rare Doc Severinsen,"This is a very rare recording of Doc Severinsen. The Summit Brass embarked on several interesting recording projects with mixed results. While all the selections here are worthwhile, the recording sounds dry and overexposed. Nonetheless, the entire purchase price is worth hearing Doc Severinsen playing Vizzutti & Tysik's ""Five Episodes for Brass."" It's a more Classical side of Doc that we rarely hear, and he's in top form, with a bold sound, fiery technique and some daunting musical challenges. All things considered, my only reservation is the recording/mixing. The playing throughout is excellent."
1,Not what it says it is,"I ordered 2 of these for my boys and this is not what it says it is. It is basically a scrap book with a couple of SMALL envelopes glued on to a couple pages. You absolutely CANNOT fit a blanket, shoes or baby book inside this cause it is just blank pages. I felt this was false advertising and am returning it. Not happy at all!!!"
5,Great for sensitive skin,"The woman who does my facials recommended this to me because I have sensitive skin. I found this cleanser to be great because it doesn't really have any odor to it, its really lightweight, non-drying and leaves my skin feeling very soft after a cleanse. One bottle lasted me about 3 months, so they give you a lot for the money it costs. That said, I also found similar results using Purpose that you can find at a drug store for a lot less. I actually switch off between the two now, since the Purpose is really gentle, but does not have the acid, which renews the skin.One hint: use as directed. The bottle says to put it on a dry face and then rinse off, which I've never heard before, but you can feel a little tingle when you do it that way that you can't when you apply on a wet face, so I suppose it takes off more dead skin that way."
4,"Great tool, useful book","I switched to IntelliJ IDEA recently and switching tools is never an easy process. This book is very interesting for both beginners and experienced developers. The former will find everything they need to learn how to use an IDE and harness its power to become more productive.On the other hand, experienced developers will find a lot of information they are already aware of. Nevertheless, this book will prove to be useful to learn about all the features one would normally postpone the learning of because of time constraints during the day. It is also an excellent way to learn about smaller yet useful features that do not appear in the user interface. Given the time we spend in our IDE, I do think it's worth buying such a book, even to get only a few pieces of information. A few of these gems will save a lot of our time and sanity and that's the real value."
3,Good book for under 18 months,"I would have liked this book for my son when he was younger, but made the mistake of buying it for him at age two. Though he was slightly amused by the ending ""tickle, tickle"" it is difficult to hold his attention. Also, since my child does like to spend time looking at pictures in books, it is difficult for him to hear the rhyme because they are spaced out on different pages.Not for children older than two."
4,A good book on herb growing and malting,"A good book with lots of information and some history. Some very interesting recipes and information on how to grow and use herbs and spices and malt and roast your own grain. Unfortunately this book unnecessarily errs on the side of caution regarding some of the more potent and historically used brewing herbs that make great additions to a brewers herbal repertoire. This book also unfortunately has few recipes without the addition of hops which can make for an even more unique brewing experience. If your looking to grow and use herbs and hops, and to malt and use unusual grains this book can definitely point you in the right direction."
3,Rounded Garden,"This book did not have as much in depth information about hops as I had wished for, but, it did have lots of other information that a brewer would appreciate and use. The discription of different herbs and there uses would be helpful to all, but the most knowledgible brewers."
5,Excellent Children's Movie,My girls (ages 9 and 6) watched this movie for the first time and fell in love with it. We have watched it over and over again. There are alot of good messages in this movie and is very enlightening. I think it will go down as one of our classics that we will go back to watch time and time again.
4,One-of-a-Kind...If you like gruesome,"This is an unusual book that fills a niche in the annals ofcriminology. It is only unfortunate that the material istaken from archives that are dated and contain only black-and-whitephotos. The captions could have been more polished, but itis still an interesting and readable production. On second thought,updated color photos may have made the book disgusting. Itis definitely an ""R"" rated book."
2,hardly worth considering,"For starters, the piano parts are so watered down it is difficult to figure out what they originally sounded like. This is par for the course as far as printed versions of popular music go. What really sets this book apart is that the piano part are no only watered down, they are bad. Any half-decent pianist could do better faking it. Not only that, but the rhythms on the printed vocals are often nowhere close to those on the albums. To top it all off, large sections are completely cut out of many of the songs (Considering the quality of the piano parts, however, these missing instrumental sections will hardly be missed). The song selection is good but not enough to balance all its faults. Overall, I could only consider recommending this book to beginning piano students who are hard-core Tom Waits fans. Otherwise, save your money, cross your fingers, and hope a book containing decent transcriptions of these songs becomes available."
4,Highly readable account of Coronado's explorations,"If you enjoy reading about first-contact experiences between European (esp. Spanish) conquerors and native american indians, then you will definitely like this book. The book gives some essential biographical information about Coronado, but focuses on his journey from Mexico deep into the southwest of the present-day United States. Like other Spanish conquistadores, Coronado was searching (vainly) for gold and glory, but ended up finding neither. Especially interesting are the accounts of Coronado's dealings with native american indians. I strongly recommmend this book. The back cover gives favorable reviews from a number of publications, including the NY Times and the LA Times."
4,Good experience with PartitionMagic,"Partition Magic worked well once I figured out the meaning of the menus. Some actons were performed i did not anticpate based on the description. but, overall, I had a good experience with PartitionMagic."
1,XP @ sp2 Partition Magic will not even install,"Symantec Support is a joke. Symantec site is no help, but at least they are consistant, so your level of expectation is 360 below zero before you dial the phone. I service a lot of computers for customers and for years now, one of the first things I do is remove any application(s) written by a company starting with the letters syman........"
3,Partition Magic/Tragic,"Oh dear!I've used PM since V.4 and was delighted with it until two weeks ago. Stupid me had not checked the Rescue discs and when they were required they were useless. Net result a useless PC.Then to add insult to injury I used PM8 to partition my brand new laptop -I have a system that needs to access specific drive letters. Guess what? As is becoming increasingly common, laptops and PCs don't have floppy/frigid drives. Now, I knew my laptop didn't have one - it's pretty obvious - but I thought since I can boot from the CD drive surely I can create a Rescue disc on a CD. OH NO YOU CAN'T.Now I'm in the predicament of having used PM, no rescue method and (apparently) no way to recover back.It's the old adage - Buyer Beware."
4,"Great looking, great to wear","I've owned this watch for about 8 months, and wear it 3-4 days per week for business wear. It's a smart looking watch (I get regular comments on it), with beautiful detail on the dial and markers. It has a sturdy, solid feel, and hasn't yet collected any scrapes or scratches, altho' I'm usually wearing a long-sleeved shirt. The hands are hard to see in the dark. The chronograph functions work as expected, and my kids love playing with the buttons... If you want these functions in a watch that's smart enough for formal/business wear, this is a great option."
2,Streetwise Mexico City = Junk!,"Worst map/purchase ever made, never again.Look like Mexico City is totally incomplete & I know Mexico City.This was purchased for a friend who is traveling to the city of Mexico."
4,Twisted Window,The book was exciting and really good. It had a slightly slow start but picked up quickly. The book has suspence with drama mixed in. I do believe that it was a great book even with the slow start and the cliff hanger ending it is something i would deffentaly recommend it others and I hope to read more of her books!
3,Okay for a Duncan novel,"Aa a longtime Duncan fan, I would have to place this book in the lower third of all of Mrs. Duncan's novels. I base this on the fact that it did not stick in my memory as well as I Know What You Did Last Summer (which also wasn't done justice by the movie) and Locked in Time. But, as with all of Mrs. Duncan's novel, this book has enough suspense to hold your attention 'til the end of the novel. It's worth a read, but not a buy."
2,Another bad read,When a mysterious strange shows up at Tracy's school her and herfriends are intrigued.When the stranger introduces himself Tracy's alittle Suspicious.Yet he gains her trust and friendship.Eventually he asks her to help him find his sister Mindy who he claims was kidnapped by his stepfather Gavin.Tracy agrees to help and they do find the little girl at her uncle and aunt's house.Yet why is it that she insist her name is not Mindy.Or keeps asking to go back home to her mommy.Plus why doesBrad act like he's hiding something?Soon Tracy realizes that things are not as Brad saids.He's confused and that his sister is not the little girl they found.Who is she then?Plus what really happened to Brad's sister Mindy. Read the book if you want to know.
3,Replacement small Hot/Cold Mat for NeoWrap,"I needed something small to ice my ankle or elbow. It started out great and I was careful when returning or removing from freezer. After just a few uses, I noticed water literally running off the mat. Several square sections over the past uses have just lost their liquid. No obvious damage or tear, it has just leaked out. The larger one for my back is doing the same thing. I am going to complain to company."
2,"Missing Parts, etc.",We received and put together the Veranda Sonora Outdoor Fireplace on 9/13/2007. The item was missing 3 nuts and two of the pre-drilled holes did NOT line up so the Screws could not be put into the Fireplace to Secure it. I'm VERY disappointed in the products Quality.There also was no address to write to (email or otherwise) or phone number to call in order to lodge a complaint and to see what could be done to make us a satisfied customer.
5,A gripping police drama,I really likes this series. The actors were great. Robson Green not only good to look at but an actor in command . Their personnel lives intwinned with the drama was an added plus.
4,Star Wars is the best,"This CD is one of my favorites. I love the movie and the soundtrack is even better. If you like the movie you'll like this CD. The best track on this is #2 ""Duel of the Fates."" It sets the mood for this awesome movie."
3,different but something's missing,"Here's an alternate view to all the glowing reviews of this soundtrack. It's all Williams to be sure; meaning it's technically astounding and dense, full of ideas and impeccable craftsmanship, but where's the spirit that made the first 3 scores so magical? While Dual af the Fates is one fantastic Orfian blow-out there is little left to get excited about. Anakin's theme is lovely but the other material is just about forgettable. As a soundtrack it goes along without focus or thematic structure and then simply ends. Not very satisfying."
4,Another Star Wars Soundtrack,"It's a sountrack and it's Star Wars. There's new material and old material, linking it to the other movies very well. I wouldn't be surprised if the music transistions throughout the first three episodes. I can't see why people are thrilled with the soundtrack but I can't see why some people don't like it either. Just remember this first movie is supposed to be more dramatic then episodes 4-6."
3,"Okay, but not as Star Wars-y as you'd think","The Phantom Menace's best music on here was Augie's Municipal Band and Duel of the Fates. However...the music was placed in the wrong order. Anakin's Theme shoulda been in the middle, not near the beginning! Overall: if you're a total Star Wars fanatic like me, you might like this, but mostly, it sounds like classical music and only the beginning and end sound different."
5,"Step aside, James, Leo, Kate, and Titanic...",I have just read the movie storybook and listened to some of the music - looks like the Jedi Lightsabers will sink the Titanic at the box office from what I have seen thus far!!EVERYONE: I'm still smarting about Star Wars losing out to Annie Hall for Oscar's Best Picture in '77: Will The Phantom Menace be the one for George Lucas this time? Will John Williams win another Oscar for this inventive score?
4,John W. definitely has the force!!,"Like everyone else, I was a little disapointed with the actual movie...I thought it was too predictable.But a big thumbs up for the music!!! It saved the movie from dying. --just a fan"
2,So-so,"I did not enjoy listening to this CD, though I really liked the film. I expected a better and more dynamic soundtrack but only the opening score is good, the others are quite boring. You can buy it to have a souvenir of The Phantom Menace, nothing more."
1,Yuck!,Jeeze this is suck a stupid soundtrack. The movie is even worse! Whats so good about star wars? It's just some stupid people flying in ships. The music is for losers and it's just plain DUMB!
4,"Better than ""Bed Number Ten"" at least...","This book was better than ""Bed Number Ten"" becasue it gives more information about GBS. She describes her pain and her experience with the hospital and GBS more in detail and is not revolving around her personal life. Who cares if her niece had to bake a pie????"
3,Mrs.Hoffman 5th Grade Book Review{Collin McNeill},"This book is about more that baseball. It's about a kid who's parents have died and left him with very little money. After all that is going wrong he gets banned from something he loves. (baseball)He lost alot but,he finds some help from places he would never have thought of in his life. Find out from reading the book."
2,If you want a sunscreen this is for you...,"If you look up each ingredient in this product you will learn that all are sunscreen ingredients. There are no ingredients that claim to reduce wrinkles only those that prevent future wrinkles caused by sun exposure.I have been using this product along w/ the Healty Skin Rejuvenator for about one month, and have not noticed any visible differences in the condition of my skin.If you are looking for a facial sunscreen this would be the product for you, but if you are looking for a product to reduce the appearance of wrinkles, I suggest that you look elsewhere. I am going to do the same..."
2,Snapware Christmas Ornament Storage,"I had purchased several of these containers previously and have been extremely happy with them. These newer containers are not the same quality as the old ones. After four to five episodes of snapping/unsnapping the layers to place variously sized ornaments, two of the catches that insure snapping of the layers together just broke right off, making them unusable."
2,Lacks quality,"The latch broke when I opened the box. The dividers are cardboard and are not secure. However, customer service was great."
1,Unreliable,I owned this player for almost two years before it had an irreperable failure. The same goes for the 110 CD version which I also owned for two years before its mechanism jammed and failed. This twice-shy buyer will never again buy a Technics or Panasonic product.
5,Beautiful,"Wow! This novel was so amazing. It was full of poetic prose and written in such an eloquent manner. The book has also been adapted unto film, so you can look forward to watching that as well. Very different and unique. It is a must read for lovers of dystopian novels."
5,Worth it.,This book should be given to every Christian couple prior to their marriage. It is short and concise. Highly recommended.
4,My uDrive Review,"This disc drive is one of the best that i have ever used before. It is very ""high tech"", and high quality, but for a very reasnoble price. It also looks better than the other plain old white drives. I am very pleased with it."
5,Great Investment,"Always enjoy Popcak's work. We give this book as a gift for friends who have become engaged. Thorough yet concise, accessible, and humorous. Glad it's back in print."
1,Battery Drains out quickly,"Well with all the hype and looks, I'm sorry to say this phone lacks the most important feature - *** THE BATTERY ***. Within 3-4hr of full charge, you will see that battery goes to < 50% (without making any call) Happened with 2 different phones. I think they are cheating us when they say -From cingular site -Talk Time: Up to 8 HrsStandby Time: Up to 15 DaysTHIS IS NOT TRUE.Ok I'm done with phone, will return it back."
2,Great user interface but poor battery life,"W600i is a very nice phone to use. The user interface is easy to learn. It has all the nice features: Bluetooth, GPRS/EDGE, quad-band, etc. However, its battery life is really poor ... barely two days of standby power! I cannot even go the weekend without re-charging ... The other negative of the phone is its thickness. It is close to one inch thick!"
4,Great phone but...,"The mp3 player has excellent audio and intuitive interface on par with iPod. (I carry around this phone inplace of my iPod Mini nowadays.) The speaker phone is slightly better than the ones on the newer motorola phones (e.g. Razr & v551). Battery life is superb, lasts about 3 days on average use compared to 1.5 day for Razr. (I own both the Razr and w600i) Instant messaging support is very cool with support for ICQ, AIM, and Yahoo Msgr. Overall a great phone but the camera's picture quality is very poor for a 1.3 megapixels it has too much noise... The screen can also get scratched easily akin to the problem iPod Nano has so I suggest investing in a screen protector (such as the ones for PDA) and covering the screen for additional protection. With all things considered I give this phone 4 out of 5 stars."
1,awesome look but terrible inside,"I love this phone. More precisely, I love the look of the phone, but no more. Why?I decide to write this review after returning the phone to Amazon for the second time. The first time I returned it is because there were intermittent noise during the phone conversation, which was extremely annoying. The second time I returned it is because of the White Screen of Death (WSOD). Just google ""WSOD and w600i"", and you'll see how many people suffer from this. Once you see the WSOD, the phone just die.I know beauty is skin deep, but I don't know it applies to mobile phones, too."
1,"biggest power consumption,","Everything works fine, but it can only sustain less than two days for very lightweight use (most of the time in standby status)I ordered two sony ericsson w600i from wirefly, they are bundled with cingular family share plan. Both phone are locked to cingular.Talked with sony ericsson support service, sony doubted it may be the problem of battery or phone and both of them.Talked with wirefly, they decided to exchange."
3,"great mp3 phone, but overall sucks","I was looking for a while and I have to say, this is so far the best mp3 sound out there period. To be honest, this phone sounds better than my iPod mini !!It has 256MB which is OK for my everyday podcasts (phone shows up as additional drive under Win2k and thus any podcast client directly saves into it).now the bad things...If you open/close the phone 200times, you can loose one screw as i did... grrrrr Cingular said it is common.the headset connector to the phone is big and bulky (why the hell they don't use normal connector) and I think it will break very very sooon.Other thing (and it is nothing personal), all my friends call it [...] PHONE .... I love orange and I don't give a [...] but maybe you do...."
5,How Good Deltora Dragons #2 Was,"It was a very good book. I liked the part when Lief, Barda, and Jasmine enter the castle to destroy the second sister. This is a book you do not want to miss out on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"""Killllll!!!!""",A very mediocre movie that left me very unimpressed. This is a movie that rode a trend (retro 70's) in order to milk a profit. It also apes and mimics other films like Sid and Nancy as well as Pulp Fiction. It tries to be shocking and decadent but really is just kind of boring and a waste of time. It seems like nothing really happens and I don't mean that in a Seinfeld way. Really not Spike Lee's best film...
3,"...but what I'd really like to do is ACT.""","It seems other viewers have pretty much covered this film. I'd just like to say to Mr. Lee: ""Stay out of your movies please!"" Even though this film was not perfect, it does try to put the viewer in a time and a place. So why does Spike show up as a ""TV reporter"" who can't act his way out of a paper bag? As soon as he starts talking, I'm no longer in 1977, I'm watching Spike try to act. I mean, when he's interviewing non-actors on the street, he comes off as a worse actor than any of them! Is that on purpose?"
1,ONE STAR FOR THE SOUNDTRACK,"Disgusting. That's all I can say. This movie had absolutelynothing to do with the summer of Sam. It was all about sex, andthat's it. The famous night of the black-out was only two minutes long. One star goes to the soundtrack, which was terific, if you like the disco. Otherwise, I felt it was a disgrace to all the victims of that summer."
2,Shakey facade for pornography,"This movie has all the marks of a bad porno movie; one animalistic and unrealistic sex scene after another loosely strewn together with a thin and uninspiring plot. One has a difficult time remembering the basic plot premise when every other scene is one more perversion splashed on the screen as if in attempts to shock us more than the previous scene. If you watch it at all, be sure you have the remote handy to fast-forward. Doing so will help you focus on what little plot their is and lesson the time you waste which you could have spent watching something worthwhile. If the Son of Sam murders of the late 1970's are your interest, you will find precious little about it here so do not bother. It is a very sad that Spike Lee, with hints of true talent, could release something that would not even pass for mediocre pornography - much less serious drama."
2,Very Average,"I Feel Spike Lee is a Film Genius but he has had Duds.and this is one of them.This Film Trys Too Hard Too Capture a TIme PEriod.if i didn't know that this was about The Son Of Sam',I would have thought this was a 2nd tier take or Spoof on Boogie Nights.John Leguizamo is still one of the most Underrated Actors Today.He does really well here also Mira Sorvino&Michael Rispoli.but alot of the film is Missing Structure.also since Girl 6 Spike has Gotten caught up in the Music Video aspect.way Overplaying music here too fit a Scene.sometimes it works but often it doesn't.Still I Give Him Credit for always trying something different but Knowing the Spike Pattern his Next Film will Be Real Good."
1,I felt like i stepped in something nasty,"This movie stunk on so many levels it's hard to focus on the specifics. Mix a dismally gloomy period piece, a cinemax-level porn flick, an uninspired schlock-horror movie, and a brutally underachieivng cast, and youve got the idea. Now lower your expectations by about 50%. I was really excited when i heard about this film, and to say i was disappointed is an amazing understatement to say the least. The premise was interesting, but it failed in every way possible. To top it all off, I saw this abortion in the Theatre! I'm not concerned about the money, because I deserved to lose that, but i want the two hours of my life back. Finally, I went to it with two other people, and they deserve a public apology. Sorry!"
1,.44 Caliber Disappointment,"This movie failed to live up to its promise. It had a strong cast including John Leguizamo, Mira Sorvino, Adrian Brody, Jennifer Esposito, Bebe Neuwirth, and Patti LuPone; it had fascinating subject material to work with in the Son of Sam killings. But the story fell flat. the lead characters (portrayed convincingly by Leguizamo and Sorvino) were unsympathetic and annoying. There was a point I was hoping they were next to be gunned down. Really. The only characters I found interesting were the Punk Rocker and his new girlfriend, Ruby (Brody and Esposito). They were sympathetic, developed, and were the sanest characters in the movie despite their societally unacceptable appearance. Other characters were flat characatures and social stereotypes, with too occasional appearances by ""son of Sam"". The movie dragged on, twisting a potentially interesting concept into a seemingly endless nightmare of boredom. 1 star was too high a rating for this awful waste of a movie."
3,Good performances but surprisingly disappointing overall,"I felt let-down by this film. It's filled with good acting and Spike Lee is truly a master with his camera but the story didn't grab me. That's particularly shocking when you have the horrifically compelling Sam murders as a foundation. I just never really cared about any of the characters that were woven around the facts. The depiction of time and place was very interesting, though, and worth a look if you're interested at all in what New York was like before Disney and Guiliani cleaned it up."
1,Don't buy this item!,"I just finished unpacking and trying to assemble this for my son. Its a pile of junk! Talk about horrible product care. The manufacturer carelessly spray painted all of the bolts that are affixed to the frame. The nuts will not screw on due to the thick coating of blue paint coating the threads. I'm unable to assemble the product and will now need to ask for a refund from Amazon. Unfortunately it was his birthday present. Additionally, the item came with a part missing (The lip on one of the ramps). I would highly suggest looking for another product."
1,cheap,"This is a cheap shoe...construction is terrible...worn twice and threads started letting go....terrible product..would never order again, and they should have refunded my money"
1,Credit me back,"Do you like offensive and hilarious films? Well than this movie is definatly not for you. I bought this hoping to laugh and get grossed out, but i ended up getting bored out of my mind. I still went on to watch the thing, cause i did pay $20 but wow, I honestly never seen a worse movie than this, Legally Blonde 2 was better than this. All these people giving reviews of 2 stars or higher must honestly be writing a review for a differant movie, or a review just for the movies trailer. All in all word of advice DO NOT BUY THIS FOR YOUR OWN SAKE!"
1,this movie wastes your life,"I remember walking down melrose in Los Angeles and the director of this movie was walking around with a portable video player showing people the trailer to this garbage. For some odd reason the DVD ended up in my apartment the other day and I decided to give it a spin. Now I want the 90 minutes that they took from me back. This is such a waste of everything it's not even funny. The jokes fall miles from everyone and the ""crude offensive humor"" must have passed me by because I didn't even chuckle. I tried showing it to my 16 year old brother thinking he might like it (being of the jackass generation and all) and he hated it more than I did. He couldn't even watch the whole thing. Don't waste your time."
1,worst movie i have ever seen.......,"....too bad Amazon does not have negative stars. Badly made, not funny and seeminly endless."
1,BE AFRAID...VERY AFRAID,This is without question the worst movie I have EVER seen.It is billed as offensive and funny...it is neither. If my foothad been caught in a bear trap and I was force to watch this movie or chew my foot off...I would cheerfully chew off my foot toescape....
1,The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen,"This is the most mind numbing, stupid film in the history of the world. The humor is on the third grade level, and if you have a brain you will not laugh one single time during the course of this piece of garbage. My brother gave this to me with the warning that it was the worst thing he had ever seen. He thought I might like it beter because I like Mr. Hanky and stuff like that but I agree with him.Don't waste your time."
1,Dimensions DO NOT meet 9mm standards,"These dummy rounds do not match the same dimensions as a typical 9x19mm round. The angle above the base of the shell is at a much shallower angle. This causes two problems in my Glock 26. First, the loaded indicator does not project far enough out to show that it is loaded. Obviously, not critical for dummy rounds, but for training purposes, that's a problem. Second, and a bigger problem, is the action does not slide all the way forward smoothly when loading. You either have to release the action further back and let the spring close it harder, or you have to smack the back of the gun to close it. I haven't tried them in a different gun yet."
2,Not this one,The Tiptons are much better. They even have springs in them and the primer moves as your pin strikes it.
4,Perfect practice makes perfect performance.,These are the only snap caps I've tried and they get the job done well. The fit Jericho 941/baby eagle II magazines well. The five pack allows practice of hand dynamics in the home without the worry of using real cartridges.
2,probs w kahr cm9,"i am having some problems with these, getting them to eject on cycling the action. i have not tried them in different guns. just the cm9."
2,"works, but not exact dimensions or weight of real ammo","Snap cap is shorter than typical federal 115gr target or winchester white box on the bullet side, but cae lengths are same. Annodized coating scuffs easily in my stock 92fs magazine. Extraction is good, and jam clearing drills are fine. Shortcomings would be No biggie, but I expected more for price. Really wished weight and height more perfectly matched profile of real ammo."
5,Love These Things,These snap caps are a great tool for practice and gun safety/function training. I've got some for almost all my various guns and use them to train my wife and demonstrate gun functions with friends and family. You can also load them randomly in a live mag to create intentional malfunctions while at the range in order to practice mal clearance.
1,Wish I saw this video review first,"I wish I saw this video review someone did on youtube before I bought these.[...]If the link doesn't work, search youtube for ""snap caps best & worst""I didn't even open the package, going to resell locally since it will cost me about 1/2 as much as they cost, to ship them back.Went to MidwayUSA.com and bought the Tipton snap caps. I don't want to dig out aluminum shavings from my gun, as the above video shows these A-Zooms will do."
1,Poor quality,"After being cycled through my gun twice, already leaving flakes of aluminum inside the gun. I bought some for my 9mm as well as .40 S&W, both sets did the same thing. Amazon Prime is a MUST!! Returned them and had a refund before returning home from the post office. Amazon Prime=awesome. A-zoom=crap"
3,Fantasy Bowling Game,"First, I would like to say it was a lot smaller than I anticipated, but it looks cool! I would recommend this for mabe a fan of bowling, but not for children under 3!"
2,Very disappointing,"When I read that this was to be the last book in the goblin series, I was sad, as so far each of the books was a fantastic rollercoaster ride of an adventure. If, however, future books would have gone in the direction of The Saint, then I'm afraid it is a good thing Ms Jackson is looking in a different direction for her next books. The Saint is 70 % a textbook on religion, social inequalities etc. Rather than love, action and adventure, we get the female protagonist, Adora, interview the male hero, Kris about his long life, religion, philosophy. This was the first book by Ms Jackson that I had to force myself to finish. All of her other books - not just the Wildside series - I was tempted to read in one go, but this book was laid aside frequently and the only inspiration to continue reading was that there MUST come some better, fun parts. Sadly, those were few and far in between. Please, Ms Jackson, go back to your wonderful writing style of the other Wildside books."
3,Directed towards the businessman/woman,The book was not exactly what I thought it was going to be. It's great for anyone who is going to be doing business with the Japanese. Period. It gives you insight into how the Japanese view American bosses and coworkers and tells you behaviors and actions to avoid.
1,Don't waste your money on this device,"Slow wireless transfer speedsNo way to automatically power-on after a power failure.The web interface was confusing and hard to navigate.It wouldn't recognize my NTFS formatted data drive. I was forced to format the thing and spend hours transferring the same data back onto the drive.I'm a pretty flexible guy but it just wasn't a useful addition to my network, so I returned it."
5,A Real Jewel in Decision Making Theory,"There are many quantitative books on Decision Making Theory but this book deals basically with the subjective aspects of Decision Making. I used it at the University of So Paulo as textbook for a graduate class on Decision Making under Uncertainty together with Clemen & Reilly's book ""Making Hard Decisions"".Bazerman's focus on common decion biases and heuristics makes us think a lot about how we make decisions and normally has nothing to do with rational quantitative ""perfect world"" decision making normally teached at business schools. Do read this book if Decision Making Theory is important for you, this is really a classic on this subject!!!! With less than 200 pages you really can't afford not reading it."
5,The Queen of Pop can do no wrong,"The 90's have a been very good to Celine Dion. She has sold over 100 million records thanks to these wonderful songs. The 9 older hits are great and showcases Celine's extraordinary voice. The 7 new songs are great also and she has all the bases cover, from upbeat pop ""That's The Way It Is"" to her trademark ballads ""Then You Look At Me"" and ""I Want You To Need Me. This album will surely beat the 27 million copies sold of Falling Into You and Let's Talk About Love."
3,Great songwriting and arrangement. Mediocre singing,"What can I say? Celine Dion is lucky. She gets to sing fantastic material like ""Then you look at me"", ""Live"", ""To Love you more"". But as usual, she gets carried away and starts YELLING her head off as if she has to prove that she's giving it all she's got. I think she actually has a good voice but throughout this album and her career one clearly feels EXCESSIVE dynamic variation- she's WAAAY too loud in some places. And that's the unfortunate part: it irritates when it should elate.Buy this CD if you like good songwriting and arrangement. The recording quality is reasonable."
5,great album,"This CD includes so many of Celine Dion's hits. ""If You Asked Me To"" is one of my favorite songs on the entire album. I also like"" My Heart Will Go On"". This is the perfect CD to listen to with your loved one. She has such a great voice.The only two hit songs that were left out of this CD was ""Where Does My Heart Beat Now"" and ""When I Fall In Love"". The exclusion of ""Where Does My Heart Beat Now"" really surprised me because that was her very first American hit!"
5,YOU MUST BUY THIS ALBUM!,"I HAVE NEVER EVER EVER SEEN A BETTER ALBUM IN MY LIFTIME! IF YOU LIKE CELINE DION, BUT HAVEN'T PURCHASED ANY OF HER ALBUMS, THIS IS PERFECT FOR. IT'S GOT ALL THE GREAT SONGS OF HER CAREER, LIKE ""MY HEART WILL GO ON"", ""IT'S ALL COMING BACK TO ME NOW"", AND ""BEUATY AND THE BEAST"". ALSO OTHER SONGS THAT ARE NEW LIKE ""THAT'S THE WAY IT IS"" AND ""LIVE"". PERFECT FOR ANYONE WHO REMOTELY LIKES CELINE DION!"
1,not her best,"celine can do better than come out with a compilation. i can't stand her anymore, she is not as good as before. and THAT'S WAY IT IS su(ks, she can't sing up-tempo songs."
5,THANK YOU CELINE,"I never really appreciated Celine Dion until a few years ago when my wife and I got into a car accident. I was much more seriously injured than my wife was so I was taken to a hospital that was almost 100 miles away from her.While in the hospital I thought of my wife and Celine's song ""The Power of Love"". This song really helped me through a tough time.All The Way..A Decade of Song showcases Celine Dion's incredible talent. There isn't a bad song on this CD. Maybe it's just a little more personal with me."
4,Worthy best of album...and worthy new album too...,"This album could be seen by some as a best-of or greatest hits album, but despite its 9 Celine hits (7 of which were overplayed on the radio and one of which, ""Love Can Move Mountains"", was underplayed, a rare fate for Celine hits), it has enough new songs to avoid being a sell-out album. While most of the new songs, with the exception of ""I Want You To Need Me"" (another Diane Warren penned future superhit) and ""That's The Way It Is,"" most of the new songs are not all that memorable, but they're not bad either. I find it pleasing even on repeat listens, which is not all that common with some of Celine's often overplayed hits..."
2,Celine's great but not on this one!,I love Celine Dion but All the Way was a dissapointment. I expected more from her. I love Because You Loved Me and Thats The Way It Is but thats about it. Celine should use her voice in more pop songs. The opera is wearing off a bit. Too bad Celine! I'll wait for you to release your next album and then we'll see!
1,Celine...What were you thinking?,"It comes as no surprise that Celine is making a desperate attempt to try to outsell Mariah Carey. Why else would she tell the world she is taking two -five years off. Who cares, plenty of artists take breaks between albums, but they don't publisize it and bring their ailing husband on national television to gain popularity. As for the album itself...It's very lackluster with no diversity. Same old ballads, different words.By the way...one reviewer wrote that Celine is the world's biggest selling artist...I beg to differ once again. That title belongs to MARIAH CAREY!"
1,Too Boring...,"Every single song on this album sounds just as if they were all the same songs... I really WANT to like this album but... It's too boring... Try other albums like ""My Love is Your Love"" by Whitney Houston or ""Rainbow"" by Mariah Carye."
1,pls shut her up,what a bad idea to start a year with celine dion's song! she can't sing at all ! pls give me a break!
1,And she calls this a greatest hits?,"Well personally I would give it a zero, because this cd is not even good, its just one of those sorry cds and i hate to say it Celine Fans, but she cant even sing and write her own songs. Oh and I have to say that MARIAH is wayyyyy better than her, sowee again but THAT""S THE WAY IT IS!"
1,Ha ha ha ha ha hahaha ha,"This skinny girl is not talent and why she's keep getting millions and millions for what?? her weak voice, her ugly face...?? I really don't understand what's so special about her. None of the songs are worth listen to more then 5 seconds. She will be forgotten in 2 years."
2,Wasted talent,"This album is the perfect example of an artist singing below her potential. She's turned into a singer interested only in selling records, rather than stretching and growing. Faux pas abound. What's with the pronunciation problems on ""That's The Way It Is""? She ""swallows"" her vowels and it is very distracting. She should take lessons from her self-proclaimed idol, Streisand, and learn to keep her voice forward and clear. She, at one time, had the promise of being this generation's Streisand - the consumate voice of the last generation - but she has let down her guard and insisted on including insipid, silly songs in her repetoire. Maybe the next couple of years off will give her some prospective and she'll return interested in more important work. The direction she's headed in will lead her into a short-lived, albeit stellar, career. Get serious, Celine, or don't bother."
3,Needed to swap MIDI IN with MIDI OUT,"I encountered the same problem as Toni Haun, and needed to swap the MIDI IN port with MIDI OUT port for the adapter to function properly."
3,Input/output reversed - either on interface or keyboard,"Input/output are reversed - either on this interface or on the Yamaha Keyboard. Other than that, works OK. ......... ....."
