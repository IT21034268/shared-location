2,not original,"I personally found this book to be annoying. The 2nd one was much better and the plot was better laid out. The style of writing here was not very good (please do not compare to Harry Potter because it does NOT even come close) and the characters seemed either over done or not enough. I'm sorry, but I didn't find it very real. However, in the Arctic Incident, I was kept better entertained. Unfortunately, in both books, Eoin Colfer needs DRASTIC character development because everyone is so...rigid."
4,Amazing devotional and liturgical aid (and CHEAP),"I won't recite here who Cranmer was -- for that see one of the reviews above or MacCulloch's excellent biography.This is a truly practical book -- as a devotional aid for any Christian, as a help for pastors and other designing their churches' liturgies, and as an aid for family worship.The two most amazing things I notice here:1. That Eerdmans is able to sell such a nicely packaged hardback for such an INEXPENSIVE price.2. That so many folks wrote reviews of this book, and so many have voted on the usefulness of these reviews, and yet this book is only ranked 195,000th as of my writing! I'm inclined to buy an armful more of these just out of principle."
1,unplayable,i am not happy about the Austin Powers dvd because i cant play it on my aquipment i did not know it came from the USA which has a differant region to europe. europe is region2 usa is region1
3,"Good movie, disappointed no digital copy",Usually when you buy blue-ray you get a digital copy to put on your phone or ipad etc. My one disappointment with this was the lack of any sort of digital copy.
4,Great for Late Nights,"Have you ever found yourself awake after many hours of tossing and turning in your bed? This is great for late nights such as these!!! You will be laughing until you fall over from exhaustion! I loved the 3rd movie - it was 10 times better than the two prior releases. (Although all 3 are wonderful)The reason I marked this review down was that I found the same three disc pack for $... less at BestBuy. Great movie, but look elsewhere!!!"
3,Perfection is almost the word.,"If you plan on owning the series BUY THIS VERSION. All 3 movies are brand new and shrink wrapped in their boxes and then shrink wrapped together. If you want to buy it and keep it for the future I suggest buy it now before this movie completely erased from human memory because this series is way too funny not to watch. I'm so glad I bought it when I did.HOWEVER, I was greatly disappointed when I opened the ""International man of mystery"" box and saw that the CD had NO cover art. The other 2 do but that really put a big hole in my happiness. Also on the ""Goldmember"" movie had the little booklet inside but I'm not too upset about that. I hope they fix the cover art problem though."
5,Well produced photo/reference book,"A beautifully produced (and large size) history/reference of FDR. It gives a solid general overview of his life and career, but the best feature has to be the large photos throughout (be sure to consider getting the more sturdy hardbound edition)..."
3,"Wasn't expecting a ""second""",Review really should be a 3.5. The correct item came promptly and undamaged. The item (a replacement Corelle bowl) had a blemish on the upper rim which is fairly noticeable (there is a green circle around the rim - it appeared to be smeared for about 1/2 inch distance). No other complaints.
3,Hot War,"Having proved herself in lesser positions, Honor is given command of the Manticorans' brand new battlecruiser and sent to the front line squadron of Lord Whitehaven where she is horrified to find an old adversary from the Acadamy. Meanwhile the Peeps are finding their economic methods are causing great disruptions. Their usual method of providing wealth for their unemployed masses is to take on a lesser power and strip it of it's wealth. But there are only weak agricultural powers left. Or the massively powerful Manticorans. Only a sneak attack will be able to work but Lord Whitehaven and his fleet stand in the Peeps way as the fighting goes hot."
3,Horror Harrington triumphs. Again.,"You know, as an experienced SF/Fantasy reader, I could live with the overhelming techno and political bubble, but this particular book has some other faults as well. This plot has already been played through in the first two books, and, frankly, it is getting boring. The ultra-large cast of characters does not really add anything, except confusion. Take this one out of the library and save the six bucks."
2,The beginning of the end...,"I suppose it would have been far too much to ask for Weber to have kept up the quality he showed in the first two books. This book lacked both the hard sf aspect of the previous books and the sequels' drama; it bored me. The first two books, of course, are far better than anything else in the series - the following books descend into very readable formula novels. Good fun reading, but in no way comparable to On Basilisk Station."
3,The War is the Main Character,"The war between the 'peeps' and the 'manties' is the main focus of this novel. The People's Republic of Haven has finally decided to attack Honor Harrington's Kingdom of Manticore in order to stimulate their economy. The reader is subjected to strategy sessions led by admirals, spies, and political leaders on both sides, and comparatively little of Honor Harrington is shown. Honor is assigned to the new Reliant-class ship Nike (a name with lots of history, which Weber proceeds to *tell* us about), and she does feature in one of the war's engagements.Overall this book was more of an political history than an action novel. It lacked focus. The battle actions are good, but even with them carrying the book, 'The Short Victorious War' falls on the pedantic side. (Includes a couple chapters against/about Dolists, Weber's version of welfare.) If you like military history or alternate history you may like it more than me. Two and half stars rounded up to three."
2,just not that great,This book falls way short in providing adequate examples and leaves you guessing many times on how to handle cetain scenarios.
3,Casino Lights 99,"Bob James Trio. Rick Braun, Larry Carlton, Kenny Garrett, Boney James, Kirk Whalum, Kenny Garrett Quartet, George Duke, and Fourplay."
5,Urban Salsa at its best!,"Brenda has done it again. She has the voice and the feel which projects throughout the entire album. Every song is a hit, if you like Marc Anthony, Victor Manuel and the other contempary Salseros' then you'll love this one and her other Salsa album."
2,Second Quality Merchandise,"The shoes came with a torn out brass ""eye"" for the laces. This is not a first quality item and I feel that I was taken advantage of by the vendor."
3,OK shoes,"These shoes are comfortable enough. The uppers are leather and look to be well stitched. However, the interior of the shoe and sole look very cheap. I don't expect these shoes to last very long. Another product made in China."
4,Good Work Shoe,Really comfortable shoe! This is my 3rd pair so far. The shoe wears out after about 6 months but that is because I work in a manufacturing environment. I know at least 5 others in the office that have the same shoes.
4,Dockers Toe Oxford,These shoes are great and have great comfort. I like the fact that they have a cushion around the ankle area and protects me from cuts.
4,Good shoes bad soles,"These shoes lost their original luster as soon I cleaned them with a damp cloth in order to remove some collected dust but it wasn't that bad either, also the soles were visibly eroded after just a month of use. But not everything is bad, the shoes are very comfortable and very casual yet elegant."
4,Comfortable Shoe,"These shoes are very comfortable and true to size. My only complaint is the leather at the heel of the shoe is sort of peeling back from the shoe. It is not coming apart, the leather is just sort of loose and rolling down. I would purchase again though."
4,"Docker's Men's shelter plain toe oxford, Black, M US","Looks good, feels good, has held up well (been using them 5 days a week for the past 8 months). No complaints except the price - 55$ seems a bit much, could be cheaper. Don't remember how much I paid for it."
4,Outstanding footwear,"Quality craftmanship, great looks. I got tired of the cheap shoes at bargain stores as they do not last and wear out quickly. Worth paying the extra dollars."
2,Don't ignore the negative reviews. Avoid this if a beginner.,"My library had a copy of this. Thanks goodness I hadn't bought it without looking inside.After about 5 minutes of reading Chapter One I had the feeling I was reading somewhere in the middle of the book. None of what the author was saying made me think I was learning (or about to learn Sanskrit). There were just too many overly difficult sentences to follow. Really.The layout (if you could call it that) was nearly 90% text based, meaning its not broken up much at all with graphs, charts, progressive chaptering, or sidebars. Very user un-friendly, especially for a beginner.I haven't looked at the other recommendations but I am sure they would be far better than trying to start with this."
3,Super Technical,"I am sure this book serves a very good purpose (Academic research etc).However it is not for a layman trying to learn Sanskrit.An Appreciation Without Apprehension by Bharat S. Shah is such a nice book for an absolute beginner.Among things that I don't like in this book are that the Author does not use devanagri scrip uniformly throughout the book. It would be nice to read it in the script in which the language is actually written.However, Sanskrit resources are not that easily available and I have certainly learned some valuable things from this book. So this is a good book to have in your library. Just know that this is a very technical book (and when I say technical, I really mean it). Unless you are in langage research, you will find this book hard to decipher.But there are sections that are helpful. Its a good addition to collect. Just not a book for laymen trying to learn Sanskrit.There are other grammar books which are targeted towards beginners and might be more relevant."
5,I Almost Cried,"This concert is just flat out awesome, i rocked out to every song. I love the way they did ""In Loving Memory"", i almost cried.Alter Bridge will forever be better than Creed, and this performance proved it to me. What stands out to me is that they sound as if they are recording their albums, and you always look for that in a live performance.Just buy it already!"
5,Excellent DVD,If you like Creed you must like Alter Bridge and this DVD does not dissappoint. MArk Trmonti and Myles Kennedy should always be together. These guys know how to rock. Creed i believe owes Myles kennedy a job on stage with them...Imagine what that concert would be like. Great DVD and fast shipping as usual from Amazon
5,5 stars just isn't enough. AB is unbelievable!!!,"If you are a Creed fan, and I was in their prime, then you need to make the leap to Alter Bridge. Miles is a far superior lead vocal and their live sound is awesome. I have watched this DVD a few times now, and I am thinking about leaving work early to watch again today. Worth every penny. 6 stars!!!"
5,Alter Bridge Live from Amsterdam,"This is AB at their best! I have been fortunate to see them live twice and this concert is even better.The emotiom that Mark Tremonte brings when he plays is phenominal...I actually had a tear in my eye when they did ""In Loving Memory"".Bottom Line, if you are an AB fan this is a must have!"
5,Must have,"I use this every morning and it seriously helps with eye puffiness, dark circles and wrinkles. It also soothes the eyes after you wash your makeup off. Gives a nice foundation for makeup too."
5,Great product!!,I have used lots of products and I love the fact that I can use this on my eyes and my lips. It's is rich and creamy. This is a steal. Two products are over $100.00 and this is no more then $47.00. I highly recommend it.
5,Awesome,"Love this product!! I'm 30 and I've decided to start taking beter care of my skin to avoid future wrinkles. This stuff is amazing. It is so silky going on and smells great too! I've noticed a difference around my eyes... the skin looks smoother and brighter. Haven't used it around my mouth much, but I think I may start!"
1,wrong,"Stinnett is right and this author is wrong. What this author fails to see is that the scheme, completely justified, by FDR to provoke Japan into war was hatched at a meeting in August 1941 at Placentia Bay in Newfoundland. Churchill told FDR then that unless the US got into the war by the end of the year the UK would be finished and compelled to surrender to Hitler. FDR was duly alarmed and set right after that to create a plan to provoke Japan into attacking the US. Only such an attack could flip US opinion for anti-war to pro-war. FDR did this amazingly well, so well that most Americans even today don't know the real story. They need to wise up. FDR was right in doing what he did; only by lying and scheming could he get the US into the war. And that was essential to defeat Hitler. Stinnett has done all the research needed to prove this. The author of this book is quite wrong and confused."
1,No Divas here! Just noise...,"This CD is a complete disappointment. The vocal showcase of Terry's previous work is traded for a ""PARENTAL ADVISORY"" warning. Come on... It should have a ""CRAP ADVISORY"" instead. Let me know when Martha and Jocelyn start taking his calls again."
5,NOT BAD- NOT BAD AT ALL.,I really like the beats. It's a good album to listen to. I belive Todd Terry has got something in this album that can accually go somewhere!
3,"i love YOGI teas, but this one doesn't work for me......","i've tried many calming & bedtime teas & none of them work for me, this is no exception. maybe i'm just immune to the ingredients??? i don't know. or perhaps i am just WAY too high strung & i need a triple dose or something. all i know is it didn't help me fall asleep the two or three times i tried it. and i don't like the taste of valerian, so while this blend really isn't that bad compared to some others i've tried it is ""not my cup of tea""."
3,THREE STARS,"This product is okay, but note that I have only used it for 3 days so far. I have fine lines under both eyes and I'm 18 years old SO I wanted to see if this product works. So... here's what I think so far:+ a good eye moisture; makes skin soft and smooth/ however, my eye stings and turns a little pink (IT COULD BE BECAUSE I APPLIED TOO MUCH!) I'll blame this one on myself+ there's no smell whatever- after three days, my eye skin area still looks the same"
2,Weak,"I've tried other Detox teas and this has a weak flavor and color. Not impressed, will not purchase again."
2,Poison Tea,"I don't recommend drinking this tea quickly, or while on medication. I was on antibiotics and a decongestant and was starting to feel better. Then, when I drank this tea (one cup in 30 minutes), I felt worse and nauseated. I don't know if it's the tea itself, or a reaction with the other things in my body, but I'm going to steer clear of this tea."
3,Painful,"I realize the importance of good health and to clear your system of toxins, but twice i have tried to drink this tea and bothtimes it has cause me kidney pain."
5,heated bird bath,Gave this to my parents for Christmas two years ago. They love it. They say the birds look very happy in it. Easy to install. Parents are elderly (hope they don't see this) and they aren't intimidated by it at all.
2,think twice,"I purchased one of these three years ago - lightweight, heated.At this point, the bath itself is stained - unable to be cleaned.The footed legs have rusted off.The heating element has separated from the bath."
1,NO STARS!,"it does not heat at all, water freezes and i threw out box already. i don't know if mine is defective or they are all non heating."
2,Heated Bird Bath,Very flimsy stand and difficult to put together. I expected better quality for the price.
5,Brit Comedy at it's best,Another year in one of the funniest & most unique of the British comedies. I will eventually own the whole series & enjoy them again and again.
4,Good complement to the SDK,"I found this book a very good complement to the SDK, because the SDK doc lacks explanation on many areas, and the book gives good background info on many topics.The only thing I don't like is the use of VB.Net as examples in the book."
4,SUNNY MUSIC,"It's very pleased to get music like this. And it's interesting that there's special music for Leo.When I was listening to it,I kept my eyes closed, then I felt I was in the shining sun. How great it felt! It had been cloudy for quiet a few days,that always drives me mad. But now I've got some sunshine to ""hear""."
1,No service!,I own this unit and the sonar portion has malfunctioned since I bought it. I recently submitted it for repair and was told it would be $300 for repair BEFORE they looked at the unit!
3,it's ok,"As far as carrying 2 bikes, it works as designed. 2 thing that you should know....1. some of the foam piece started cracking after about 2nd time I used it. after few more, it just split all the way around. It still works if you flip the foam.2. depending on how tight you tie this down, or perhaps weight of your bike, it left some scratches on the trunk.I would recommend using this only if you have light bikes."
4,Good rack for the price,"I have used this bike rack one time, with one bike, and on a highway going over 70mph for a 45min trip. The bike stayed on and remained secure after I parked and checked to see how the bike rack held up. The top straps, that go into your trunk, stayed tight and didn't loosen, unlike the bottom straps that had started to loosen up a bit. It was nothing too severe though; despite this, I believe the bike rack would have remained on my car. Also, the bike rack did not scratch the paint on my car (white, 2000 Honda Accord) at all, but that is because I followed the instructions and really cleaned the trunk of my car and the rubber pads of the bike rack before I hooked it on."
5,Allen 102S Bike Rack,"Delivered on time as promised and in perfect condition. Extremely easy to install on my 99 Accord. Good sturdy unit with excellent design, handled my one bicycle well on a 200 mile trip. Caution, clean grit and dust off the trunk lid before mounting the rack to prevent marring of the paint and secure wheels to prevent damage to vehicle during travel. Also, make sure pedal is not in position to damage trunk lid or bumper. Very pleased with this purchase."
2,Flimsy plastic buckles broke causing my bike to fly off,"I thought this product was fine for occasional use. I used in once to cart my bike about 15 miles locally - no problems. Threw out the packaging because I decided it was a keeper. Then today, after driving on the interstate for 700 miles this week, we got back into town, went over a speed bump at about 25 mph, and both plastic buckles holding my bike onto the rack broke and it flew off. My rear wheel is bent beyond repair, and I had just had it in for a major tune-up."
5,Fits over rear spoiler,"Product is as described in the ad, new, came with in original retail package, mounting instructions, works well, arrived earlier than expected. Fits over grand am spoiler (reason we got it)."
2,Jimmy Neutron Bag,Not great...we have only been using this bag since January 3rd and it has already torn. Very disappointed.
4,"Dark and artistic, with a dash of humor.","This is probably the best vampire movie I have ever seen, because even though there is some comic relief here and there, this movie takes itself very seriously. Since it deals with a fantasy subject, it is nice to see a script that is so well written that it has the power to make you believe for the 2 hours you will spend with it. Another thing this movie has going for it is the art direction, the sets, and the music, they are all wonderful and add the the dark mood of the movie. Tom Cruise does a nice acting job. It is obvious that Brad Pitt has improved since his performance in this (such as Fight Club). I gave it 4 stars, because not everyone will enjoy the endless blood flow and darkness that comes with a vampire movie.Overall, very stylistic and fun. Reccomended."
4,"Blood Will Make You Melancholy, First Thing In The Evening","Neil Jordan's adaptation of the Anne Rice novel works fairly well. It follows a melancholy vampire (Pitt) telling his story to a reporter in the present day, recounting the tale of the vampire who made him, the girl he had a hand in turning to a vampire, and the others he has met in his travels. Pitt is sympathetic in the lead, with Kirsten Dunst holding her own as the vampire in an eternal girl's body. Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea do very different turns as vampires. Despite getting the top billing, Tom Cruise is a supporting player as Lestat, and unfortunately is the only weak part of the cast, as usual playing himself. The man is incapable of disappearing into a character."
5,Anne Rice does it again,"Interview with a Vampire is a great work by Anne Rice and it has been made into an excellent movie. The acting by Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt is amazing, and Kirsten Dunst has a stellar performance as Claudia. The story is told very well. I've read some of Anne Rice's other books and I will definitely read this one after seeing how good of a movie it is."
5,"Haunting, mystical vampire movie","What amazes me is what little violence/gore and little scariness this adaptation of Anne Rice's popular 1980s book. It cuts down to the chase and holds true to the tenderness and fascination that Anne Rice's vampire books contain. Tom Cruise cuts down his clean-cut image, dons a long blond wig and does a good job playing the casual Lestat, while Brad Pitt also does an impressionable job as Louis. Both do a commendable job as a screen duo, and both actors need to take on more roles like 'Interview,' instead of an hot-shot sports agent (""Jerry Maguire."") and a guy out to get his lover (""The Mexican."") Roles like these best fit their quiet, pleasing dispositions, and they should do a prequel like ""The Vampire Lestat"", or maybe one of Anne Rice's standalone recents like ""Vittorio The Vampire."" Rated R for mild language, sexual content, nudity, and some vampire violence/gore."
4,And then I said farewell to sunlight...,"Really great acting by the ravishingly gorgeous leads - Brad Pitt (as Louis) and Tom Cruise (as Lestat), and a fine performance by Kristen Dunst (as evil Claudia...she later appeared on ER as Charlie =)) The directing and script are great - they capture the dark mystical essence of the book perfectly, but at times the movie lapses into long and rather tiring ramblings."
4,A visual feast for the eyes,"When I first heard the news of Ann Rice's book being made into a movie, I thought what a shame to belittle such beautiful work. Still I went the opening night and found myself utterly in love with Louis....What a wonderful potrayal of sadness and regret. Lestat, the arogant and handsome self proclaimed master of vampires, done so nicely. The two things that bothered me most were Claudia's age-she was 6 in the book, and Armand who took me so by surprise that I laughed. But he was refreshing and sexy as an older vampire. The music was simply wonderful, the scenary beautiful and I think they put on film all they could for a two hour movie. Sometimes less is more."
4,Better than expected,"The movie arrived on time and I received one of those paper version that for some reason is better for me, it includes more printed material and the texture is better than the regular plastic case of a DVD"
5,Great movie,"Loved the book and really like the movie, despite Tom Cruise with a phony French accent as Lestat. Brad Pitt as Louis saved the movie for me."
5,Best vampire film ever!,"I recorded this outstanding movie last night on German TV. A friend had told me it was good but I still was not prepared for the exellent performances of Kirsten Dust, Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater. It was the very best film about vampires that I have ever seen and the very best horror film though I would not classify it as horror at all. Much better than ""From Dusk till Dawn"" for example. I just can say: ""Watch it!""!"
4,Definately Worth Watching,"Alright. I'm not going to put a long winded explaination of the movie. With 200+ reviews, I think you know what it's about.For being an adaption of the book, it's very well done.Granted, the first time I saw it, I saw Tom Cruise and went ""HUH""? But after reading ""The Interview with the Vampire"" and comparing it to the movie, and later Stuart Townsend's role as Lestat, I thought Tom Cruise did a damn good job at playing Lestat. He got it closer than Townsend did.The movie has quite a few similarities to the book, but some things we cut out.However, the acting was good and I'd recommend this movie to anyone."
4,Beautiful---Left me wanting more,"Okay, it's not as good as the novel---ashame they had to cut so much out. The acting is excellent except for Antonio Banderas who seems to be playing a caharicature of a vampire while the other actors really breathed life into the undead roles. I thought the end of the movie was a perfect way to end a movie where the ending of the book was the perfect way to end the book. I don't think the book's ending would have packed the same jolt at the end of the film, and the film's ending would have been too overdone for the novel. I had to view the movie as a movie on its own & stop comparing it throughout to the novel. They're both great. Who would have thought Cruise would make such a great Lestat?I hope they do make a movie version of ""The Vampire Lestat""---although, I think that would be better as a television miniseries----that way they wouldn't have to cut so much out."
5,A Tour De Force,"well i saw the movie and i must say that it was seducing, primitive, evil but in all honesty entertainig, thats all we want isnt it? Crusie I feel played the Vampire Lestat very well and i do think evil is a good scene for him. Pitt did a good performance as tragic and beautiful Louis, he played the part well but to much sulking but, perhaps, thats what immortals do.Dunst was by far the best actress for her age i don't think i could slip the words that fast at that age! And magical Armarnd by good, too old Antonio but he is talented and the accent captured the romance of Armarnd completely. I really recommend this movie it is both dark and beautiful esp the costumes i would die to wear one of those outfits. The movie is a savage garden."
3,"NOT A LOST BOYS MOVIE, BUT A GOOD ONE!","Ok, it's a good vampire movie, one of the 5 betters ever made ( including Fright Night, The Fearless Vampires Killers, Dracula and of course, The Lost Boys), but is not the best vampire movie. I think many have forgot the best one, The Lost Boys, which certanly has very good looking actors as Brad Pitt. Compare Brad Pitt with the actors of Lost Boys (Jason Patric, Billy Wirth- the long darkneed hair vampire) and it's not just the actors, all the elements in Lost Boys made it the BEST VAMPIRE MOVIE EVER. And don't forget it was made in 1987- above of it's time."

3,Better than standing,"I ordered this chair to relieve the long waits for Mardi Gras parades in New Orleans and it served its purpose. However, it has a very small seat, even my skinny friend overflowed the seat area. So, be warned, it's not very comfortable, but it is very lightweight, easy to pack, easy to carry, and served my purpose. I would not recommend it for long periods of sitting but if you need something to rest on in between standing sessions, this stool will work just fine. Also, it's fairly steady if you sit properly."
4,Easy to carry!,"Great for going from place to place! Light, easy to collapse, and easy to carry. Only problem: uncomfortable after 15 minutes...and I'm well padded."
4,Early Oystein Sevag Work,"This is the only Oystein Sevag album that I wouldn't suggest to first-time Oystein listeners/purchasers. I am a fan of Oystein's work; however, this album showcases Oystein's early sound. A good bit of it reminds me of Yanni, and I get the sense that Oystein wasn't quite sure of his direction on this album. Once Link came about, it's apparent that his sense of direction was more established.Don't get me wrong, this is definitely an Oystein Sevag album. You can hear elements that are used later in Link, Global House, Bridge, and even Caravan. I would recommend this album for fans of Oystein, for people that want to hear his earlier work, or for people that are already familiar with his more recent work."
4,Great family movie.,"Another one of those fun little movies that kids seem to enjoy. Starts off as a real-time movie, then moves to cartoon, and back to movie. My 5 year old loved it, and i really liked it as a kid too, still fun to watch."
5,great movie,one of my favorites growing up and our 4 year old son loves it too. he wants to go on the adventures himself when we go to the library.
4,"""Whiskey Galore""","The was also sold in this country as ""Tight Little Isle"", a slightly different; and, I feel, better movie."
1,Couldn't watch it.,"Some great vintage racing shots at the beginning, the musical sound track is truly horrifying. The dialogue in the opening 2 scenes was enough to make me turn it off and place it into my discard pile."
4,A family project?,"This CD is very good. Jordi Savall, as Daniel Morris affirms, has done a formidable work... But... why Montserrat Figueras is in every CD? yes, she knows how to sing this repertoire... But there are GREAT singers who can do much better. We keept buying this material because it is good and important, but, Please, give us other choices!"
2,Didn't really like it,"I reread this book to see, why I didn't like it much, it didn't take me long to find out. The author seems to think it's wrong if women want to practice celibacy or try to remain a virgin until marriage. She doesn't think that's something to be proud of. Now my problem with that is if young girls that are planning on trying to wait until marriage read this book might think that's something to be ashamed of, or they want be able to please their spouse if they have not been practicing. I think more open minded people, probably enjoyed the book more so than myself."
4,Troubled Mind,"Sac Town's own, Young Dre D, released his first album, Troubled Mind, in 1996. This album has all kind of songs on it. Tha beats are dark, gangsta, smooth, and what you xpect to hear coming out of Northern California. Dre D's flow on this album is outstanding, and he rips it.1. Beware Of Da Kreep - 4.5/52.

5,So much fun!,"I love this book! And so do my grandkids - 4 little boys under 4yrs. We have a dog that looks just like Carl, her name is Maggie. We substitute her name for Carl's. The pictures are so pleasing with their colors and all. Great book for little toddlers."
2,Daughter loved it; hubby banned it,"I had read the reviews about this book being a bit disturbing, but decided to give it a try anyway. My daughter loved the pictures of Carl, but her father decided to ban it, taking it to work to share with his coworkers. The illustrations are great, and most of the story is cute, but the baby falling two stories in the laundry chute, and falling into the fish tank were not so cute."
5,Good dog - or EVIL?????,"At first glance, this seems to be a charming little fantasy about the funny adventures of a baby and dog.However, when you think about it, what is the dog really up to? First, he takes baby to Mommy's makeup table, where baby inhales toxic talc powder into his little lungs. Then, Carl attempts to drown baby in the fish tank. Failing there, he pushes baby down the laundry chute. Since none of these sinister tactics have the desired effect, Carl decides to at least try to harden baby's arteries by providing a snack of butter and half and half. When he hears Mother's footsteps, he quickly disposes of the evidence of his depravity and puts baby back into the crib......until next time..."
1,Try Vaseline!,"I too could not use this lip balm because it actually gave me chapped lips.I kept applying it thinking eventually it would work.Then, one night I put Vaseline on my lips and by morning they were nearly healed.I now put Vaseline on my lips each evening and they are healed and moist."
3,The real life Forrest Gump!,"Corso has been responsible, in this highly entertaining work of obvious fiction, of weaving a web of Forrest Gumpisms. He claims to have been involved in all major undertakings from going to the moon to the arms race to the development of all major new technologies. It clearly is what I would call ""secret fiction"" in that he poses everything as being real, but what he has produced is a very funny account of ""what if"" aliens crashed landed and everyone went after the goods."
2,Not fact - just a good story,"I was looking for some hardened facts, but once again was dissapointed by reading a piece of fiction. Yes, Roswell may be true, and yes reverse enginerring 'might' of occurred, but a lot of what is claimed just does not ring true. Still, it was quite thought provoking. I still remain a 'believer' am not at all religious, in fact believing more in ET's than in God. JUST GIVE ME SOME FACTS PLEASE. STOP THE STORIES."
4,ET Phone Home,"This is one of the better books about the Roswell incident that I have read. It would be hard to just make all this up, although the military has gone to great lengths in the past to do just that.Although Corso does not explain why he suddenly wanted to disclose all this information, he does give insider insight into what the army had and what they wanted to do with it. It makes a lot of sense when it comes to the rapid technological advancements we made in the 20 years following the crash.He also shares his mindset, which explains why they considered the ETs hostile and thought time was of the essence to reverse engineer the recovered technology into weapons to fight the aliens.Unfortunately, in the Epilogue, he still feels their intentions are hostile and thinks we can now take on these aliens and beat them with our new weapons. Hmmm... I'm not going there."
3,A bit slow but interesting,"The late Philip Corso tells the story of how he came into possession of top secret files and alien artifacts from the crash at Roswell in 1947. He was told by his commanding officer to ""see what you can do"" with the alien technology. He goes on to say how he set it up so that the technology would be fed to the public little by little so the public wouldn't suspect anything amiss. According to him this is where most of our modern technology came from including the transistor radio. Interesting book but slow paced."
4,Easy read and detailed,I enjoyed the detail's and the possibilities of alien influence on todays world is fun to ponder. I would recommend this book for anyone that considers the Roswell incident still up for discussion.
1,This guy is delusional at best !,"Anyone who is even relatively educated in science and technology, knows the evolution of disciplines that led to all the inventions that Corso claims came from flying saucers. Hard work and intelligent innovation ( by humans ) led to these inventions. I'm hoping Corso is just delusional, because if he isn't, then he's a blatent liar ! Don't waste your time with this supposed book."
4,"Roswell, my Review","I just recently read the book ""The Day After Roswell, written by Col. Philip J. Corso and I found this to be extraordinarily insightfulk and full of wonderful content. I enjoyed reading this book because I am interested in the whole deal with the Roswell Crash and I am also writing a paper for my Science class based on the incident which occured in Roswell, New Mexico July of 1947. This was a very interesting book and I hope that one day we will all know the truth. I give this book four stars out of a possible 5 stars."
1,I wish that this 2 could be a 10.,"My brother wrote me a rave review of Corso's book.Wanting to start reading it immediately, I ran to the local bookstore and paid list price. By the second chapter, everytime I turned a page I expected to see ""SUCKER"" as the only word on the next page.Obfuscation, smoke and mirrors would be my kindest description of this book. Let me ask one question (of many). Why did they transport debris from the Roswell UFO via air (page 23), but shipvia truck the alien body which Corso saw atFort Riley? This body was enroute to Wright Field,Ohio (page29). I think if I found an alien body,I would handle it as a high-priority shipment.For all you fellow UFO lovers out there, let merecommend ""UFO's -A Scientific Debate"" edited byCarl Sagan and Thornton Page. This book hascredibility and challenges the findings of Project Blue Book and the Condon Report.Rich Noblett"
1,Unblievable!,"Steer clear of this book at all costs. The reviews here were surely written by the authors' relatives, not sane people"
5,"Wonderfully entertaining, even if it's bat guano.",I have no idea what to believe in this elaborate tale of hostile et's and massive cover-ups that sound so wildly incredible even Hollywood would be reluctant to produce it. I give it 5 stars for pure entertainment value.
2,It is just OK!,"In terms of taste, it is not the one I want to re-order. I can't tell if it really can boost one's immune system though!"
1,UGH Yogi Teas taste awful,"I guess it's a matter of tastebuds but unless this healed me for good I wouldn't drink another sip if I was paid to drink it. Okay - there might be a price that would make me drink it everyday but only one cup and the price is pretty high :-) I've tried several yogi teas and this one as well as the others are just absolutely horrible. If I don't like something or I have an allergic reaction (which I frequently have from foods or preservatives) I usually pass it on to my mother or sister so the money isn't wasted but this, I threw away, every last package. Another good reason for Amazon to sell food in smaller quantities. YUCK!"
2,Gettin' Buck Wild Was Boring!,"I've read and loved Sex Chronicles and couldn't wait to read Sex Chronicles II. After reading the first weak story, I thought that the second story would have to be better. Unfortunately, after the sixth story, I couldn't force myself to read anymore. The majority of the stories ended the same, some without an ounce of morals. I thought the young lady plus the ""foursome"" story was uncalled for. Sex Chronicles was on fire; Sex Chronicles II amounted to a lump of coal. I've read a few books by Zane, but this one seems to have be rushed. I'm glad it was a gift."
3,OKAY - BUT A LITTLE TOOOO MUCH !,"Yes, I read the book all the way through. But, the book can be too much. I say this because after a while it seemed like reading a porn movie turned to book type thing. ZANE repeated many of her descriptive words in each chapter. It got to be a little sickening. Anyway, it is definitely an erotic type book. I gave it three stars because - Like I said - The repetition of words and scenes were the same - except different characters. ON THE DOWN LOW THOUGH : My favorite was the chapter of the woman washing her clothes in the laundromat at night ! Well, thanks for reading my review ! Be prepared for the "" IN YOUR FACE "" scenes when you read this book ! Peace Out !"
5,Excellent Product,"This may not be the only grammar book you'll ever need, but it certainly is comprehensive and well written. I use it to teach high school and college students as well as adults who need grammar instruction. I recommend it."
3,The 'only' grammar book?,"Although well written and quite descriptive any grammar book written by n American is for American nd cannot be described as the "" only grammar book""!"
4,Good Summary,"This book is very good. I Still wish it was more complete, but still worth the money. Needs a few more details on prepositions."
1,looking for a writing guide,"not the book i wanted, and it came way later than would have been helpful. get an mla, instead. Thurman's book only provides one example for any given situation, and her examples are outdated, pedantic. the only reaon i didn't return it is because I am superstitious..."
5,Grammar Book,Fantastic! I chose this book to help aid with learning a second language. I find it to be precise and concise.
3,A Handbook for Grammar that I have almost forgotten.,I needed a source to help me remember the nuances of English grammar. This was a good inexpensive way to do this.
5,Tastes great,"It's black tea with a little spice. It has stevia in it, I believe, so I don't even need to add any sweetener to it. This is the only tea that I've found myself consistently drinking, besides the Yogi Bedtime tea. It's not spicy as in hot, but spicy as in... kind of like mulled cider or something along those lines. Sometimes it's a bit hard to find in the stores, so it's great that I can just get a whole bunch here for less than I'd pay at the grocery store."
5,Great Book!!,"I had been knitting scarves and simple hats, and wanted a bit of a challenge, but not an extremely complicated book. This book has the best cable knit hat pattern I could have found. (believe me I looked at so many cable knit hat patterns, and this one was straight forward, and turned out beautiful). I have made several more cable knit hats since then, and hardly need to look at the pattern now, because it is so well designed. Of course there are other things besides hats. I am thrilled to find some cute tank top patterns in the book too, as well as sweaters and scarves. They are modern and stylish, yet not so difficult for the newbie knitter. If you know the basic knitting and purling, (or even if you don't, there is instruction) this would be a great ""...guide to beyond the basics"" as the title clearly states. No regrets about buying this knitting book. I refer back to it often."
5,Interesting Concept,"I wouldn't have thought that the topic of chilled and frozen desserts would make for an entire cookbook, but I was wrong. If you enjoy entertaining, making chilled and frozen desserts ahead of time is a real help on the day of the event. And typical of Mr. Food, all the recipes sound both good and easy to fairly easy."
2,too sugary,hmmmmmmmmm.... not the best tasting bar ive eaten. Taste like sugar rubber. You need alot of water to chug down afterwords.
1,Switcharoo too!,"I also wanted the superior European version of Milk. Same story with product switched for international version without Vitamin E in a lilac colored pump bottle. Am in the process of getting a product return authorization from them. They do not have any more of the German stuff. Drat! Usually, European versions of cosmetic products, like Clinique, are inferior to US. Not in this case."
4,Great Book for the Novice,"I am a guy that play a lot of basketball and do a lot of coaching. I have had no psychology background of any and I just want to know more about psychology as a habit. It is a paperback and with just 170 pages. It includes the basic concepts and theories of sport psychology that you will find very helpful. The depth of it is just what a novice needs. It helped me to plan my coaching lesson with teenagers of bad conduct. Besides, I have found even myself has gained a lot of wisdom in planning my own sporting performance. I think it is a must for a coach, in particular those who has never read anything about sport psychology."
3,It works,I only have a few complaints- doesn't have DVD optical input option even with the selectable inputs- Doesn't have remote controlled a/b speaker switch- the tv onscreen menu act a little slow some times- remote controller doesn't display the custom names entered into the reciever
2,Too Powdery,I'm not impressed by this food. It seems to disintegrate to powder rather than anything resembling actual brine shrimp. The shrimp powder is too small to catch the fishes' interest which just ends up with unfed fish and a polluted tank.
5,All Marketing Researchers should have read this book,Great review for marketing research. Suggest every academic in marketing read it.
2,disappointment,"The only reason I gave this book 2 stars is that it is about Jerry. I took it from the library because I'm a huge fan and was interested in learning more about how he came to where he is now - what I found instead were tedious details (not in a good way) from acquaintances and not much soul to the book. The book also doesn't seem to give credit to the amazingly hilarious Larry David, who is responsible for so much writing on the show. How can someone write an entire book about Seinfeld without once even speaking directly to the person you're writing about? This missing link was definitely a huge gap in the book, leaving only mundane details and a want for something authentic from Seinfeld himself."
2,Too much irelevant gossip and stupid judgments,He seems to have collected a lot of journalistic kind of history.The annoying parts are:He takes a clear moral judgment against anything os seinfeld life he does not like (he hints that somehow Seinfeld should have ocntributed to the synagouge his dad liked....... And cites the locals waiting for his contribution. Fr heaven's sake!)He does not show much depth on where his genius comes from and on the development of character.Very shallow
1,Pure sensationalist drek,"The only reason this book gets one star is because Amazon does not allow a reviewer to select ZERO stars. If you're into tabloid style hatchet jobs, knock yourself out. If you'ra a Seinfeld fan looking to learn more about the man's life, run, full speed, in the opposite direction from this book and don't look back."
4,delicious,"simple, hooky and eminantly listenable. oftentimes rocking and suprisingly sincere THIS is the album that i have always been waiting for someone to make..."
5,Brilliant re-creation of 10 years of Grant Mitchell!,"This book is a must-read for any fan of EastEnders. Author Kate Lock has true empathy, not only for Grant Mitchell but for all the other characters, and covers an amazing amount of ground. The only thing that was hard to get used to is that, because of the amount of time spanned, the non-Grant story lines are often summarized in a few paragraphs (e.g., events like Eddie Royle's murder and Michelle Fowler's decision to leave Walford). But this allows Lock to explore Grant, Phil, Sharon, Peggy, Kathy, and Tiffany in detail. The book also helped explain a few things that took place before I started watching the series. And because my PBS station in the Washington, D.C. area is about three years behind England in airing EastEnders, it's also possible to see where the show will go from here.Now that Ross Kemp (Grant) has left the show, I hope Lock writes a sequel that ties things up -- I'd be the first to buy a copy!"
1,Wow What A Waste of Money,"Now don't get me wrong. I really do love Loveless. It's such a nice series and so pretty to look at. The story is well done, even if it cuts short of what the series could be. My main problem is the voice acting. The only reason this release of the series was made was due to the new English voice track. IT. IS. HORRIBLE. The actors clearly aren't putting effort into what they're doing. This isn't surprising since most of the actors chosen have only done hentai work previously. The writing wasn't atrocious as well. Most of the lines are taken directly from the sub track and not made to flow more naturally in English.Moral of the story:GO BUY LOVELESS THE COMPLETE COLLECTION. Don't waste your time or money on the English track, you'll only end up with tears of frustration and regret."
3,Not For Everyone,"The book strongly relied on C# projects supplied with the included CD. The teach method is to have you open a project and add or change a line or two of code in order to illustrate a concept. If the subject matter were of a less complicated nature (programming), I'd almost say this book was for young children learning C#. At some point, I just decided to skip the examples and just focus on the text until I finally got tired of the book altogether. I also have another .NET Step By Step book and I see that this learning method is common with the entire series."
3,"Thankfully, it's the first...there's room for improvement","This ""first in the series"" mystery is OK, but it's not great...the author jumps from one completed scenario to another without the intervening copy. For example, on one page, Jake Eaton and Gloria Gorham can't stand each other...on the next, they're actually in love...that's not life...it's poor writing. The plot is also a little far-fetched. Hope the next in this series is better."
5,Product as described. Got it fast,"Product was as described. I Would order again. Got the book fast, which since it was for a school report, that was fantastic!"
5,Don't Judge a Book by its Cover,This book was amazing. Its exciting charictors will bring you into the story and the suspence will keep you up all night as it did me. It is about a boy named Vaungaylen (Gaylen for short) who goes on a journey to take a poll around the kingdom. He has to find out what most people think is the most delicious food because the man who raised him is making a dictioary and he needs the definition of delicious. It is great for those who love adventures as well as those who prefer other genres. There is comedy when the king and his men argue a little bit of romance when Gaylen finds a friend and a little bit scary when the villain follows Gaylen on his journey. The story is not one of those every day adventure ideas but that is what makes it so great!
3,"fun and whimsical, though it doesn't reach its potential","The Prime Minister is compiling a dictionary, but he's run into a problem - no one at court can agree on a definition of 'delicious', so the King sends 12 year old Gaylen out to poll the people.I found the premise of this story to be quite delightful, whimsical and clever, but the follow-through was less than I had hoped for. There was a certain curious emptiness to the characters that I find typical of books written in this time period - a flatness in their emotions and reactions. That's my personal opinion though; plenty of readers aren't bothered by it at all.I also felt like the various aspects of this story weren't fleshed out individually or tied together well. Such a bummer, because the book could have been so much richer and encompassing. The ending fell a little flat as well.Still, it was a decent little jaunt."
5,Werner 3-Foot step ladder,"Great ladder, light enough for the wife to carry around and tough enough to handle my 300+ pounds. Shipped in a plastic bag and came UPS in fine shape. I can't remember exactly but it didn't take very long to get, less than a week. Great shelf for paint or paint and a liquid consumable of your choice. Very sturdy and I don't find it tippy even on the third step."
1,100 professional legal forms,"I recentley purchased ""100 legal professional forms"" for business and personal use. I cannot open the files and I cannot get any support from the manufacturer.that stinks and I am very unhappy with the product."
3,"This prequel ""broke my heart""","I am a big Carlito's way fan. I saw it the first friday it was shown in 1993. I have watched it about 50 times on Video or Cable. I have a understanding of the Characters. If you do a prequel, don't pretend like nobody saw or would remember the original. I am very saddened that you didn't develop a better script. Next time, make sure your script writers are true fans. Real Fans of Carlito's way will be hurt, and please, dont recyle (Luiz Guzman)aka Pachanga. He is a very important character in the original. Also, where's Gale? or Klienfeld? or Rolando? or the DA? or Laling? or Sasso? and the ending? that broke my heart. You didn't think we cared about the ending? you made Carlito's dream come true, but you must know, he did go to Lewisburg for 5 years after paradise? or was he halucinating? and everything in the original never really took place? was it just a dream? you got some explaining."
2,wait till it comes on TV or friends tell you it sucked,"this doesn't even compare with the original. Terrible acting, the worst was by Raquel Alessi. Spend your money on something else."
1,Horrible,"This was a complete disgrace. I should have know better since Al was not in it or that it never made it to the big screen. The only thing that relates this movie to Carlito's Way is that he was a PR in Harlem. Horrible, horrible, horrible. Please don't waste your money."
4,Really good movie,"I came across a screener of this movie and had to watch it and I must say this was a really good movie. I figured it would ruin the name of Carlito's Way as the first was a classic but it didn't at all. Good acting, good story definitely worth getting it's not a let down at all."
4,does the job,"so this device does the job for which I bought it..is not that expensive like others and it really does the job although takes time until you get use to sleep with it, but I guess this for sure will happen with any other brand cheaper or more expensive.In general very good value."
4,Overall great,"I like the sleep \right night guards. I have only two complaints:1. I chew through in a pproximately 6 months2. I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night chewing the thing like gum (i.e. not fixed in place because of its loose structure at the front of the device)I continue using happily because the dentists versions are $400 and I lose them. With sleepright I can keep on in my travel bag, one in the bathroom and a spare in the drawer."
4,great,"I hadn't read many of Misty's valdemar seriesbefore this. I had read her Mage Storms trilogy before, but this book was far superior. I loved how Darien seemed normal, not wanting to sit and learn dull lessons, so he keeps running to hide in the woods. Then one day he sees something new..."
5,Read!,"I loved this book. I am a major Mercedes Lackey fan and have read most of her books. I first started reading them when I saw one (The Lark and the Wren) on my sister's book shelf and from then on I was hooked. This book was much better than I expected. Her last trilogy The Mage Storms wasn't that great so I wasn't sure about this one untill I started reading and was snagged. I can't wait to read the next books Owlsight and Owlknight. Other books of hers that are cool are The Last Herald-Mage trilogy. I have read those books over and over. Her Bardic Voices and Bardic Choices books were good too, except for the last one Four and Twenty Blackbirds. I hope she keeps on writing her Valdemar books after this trilogy since I love them so much. If you are a Lackey fan you should also check out Tamora Pierce, Terry Goodkind, Robin Mckinley, Sherwood Smith, Andre Norton, Dennis McKiernan, or\and Ursala Le Guin books."
3,Disapointingly average book seems padded for length.,"As a fan of the Valdemar series, I was surprised by the latest installment. The premise is interesting, but the plot is standard and extremely thin. The authors repeat the same scenes from two different perspectives, again and again, whether the action warrants it or not. It seems like a good start to a series, but if they didn't even have enough ideas for a full first book, maybe it should have been a short story or novella."
2,"Disappointing, not her usual quality.","Mercedes could have eliminated about 50 pages of Darien's repeated whining and excuses in the beginning and it would have been a 4 star book. Good basic idea, skim alot of the beginning 50-75 pages, then get to the good read."
5,Great for children 9-12,My grandson thinks the Monster series is wonderful. He cannot wait to get the next one.
1,No help at all!,"I have no idea why this book says you can teach yourself Gaelic. There is nothing in it to help with pronunciation, dialect, nothing. It's basically just a dictionary. If you want to really learn Gaelic get an audio program to help you."
1,Working Safely With Chemicals,"I found this book elementary, and filled with unnecessary chatting. I bought it for a college course, as it was required for the class, and found it seemed very chatty. I don't like it."
5,eb5,I really like this product. The toner seems to run out faster than the rest and wish I could purchase it separately. Fast delivery.
5,Just replaced,I just replaced this bulb this morning. I am hoping for the best since the last bulb worked since we moved here 8 years ago. Have no idea how long it was working prior. Hoping to get many years out of this one.
3,Nice lights...short life.,This is my second set of these lights. I use them for my plants so they are on about 6 hours a day. They don't last very long but they do the job and they're not too expensive. I purchased these lights from Amazon.
3,Very diverse,This album goes from the traditional punk of 'Bleach Banquet Bingo' and 'Bitter Prioritea' to sounding like Frank Black on 'Diane'. Weird...but worth it.
5,Delicious,Absolutely delicious. I put the tea bags into my iced tea maker and drink it cold. I can't say if it tastes good warm or not though. It gives me a mild boost of energy that I need. I highly recommend it.
1,Reprints of Reviews,"That about says it. Aikin really doesn't bring anything to the table. Just rehashes of info from previous reviews, not much else interesting."
1,controller didnt even work,the controller couldnt be recognized by my nintendo 64. The seller is not very easy to communicate with about getting any sort of compensation.
2,Save your money.,"It's not as great as they make it sound. I bought this for my new computer, until I could afford a new version of Adobe Photoshop. (I used 7.0 previously) Thank God this had a $40 rebate, or I'd be out $90.Adobe Photoshop and Jasc Paint Shop Pro are much better than this. And despite what others say, are less complicated to learn. Save your money. I wish I did."
2,"Not a good product, Version 9 was better","Digital Image Pro Ver. 9 was better quality software. New version 10 makes improvements on automating some tasks but made other fundamental functions work really badly: If you apply Red Eye correction, most of times when trying to increase the effect to achieve a natural eye color, the software inserts a Black ring around the eyes!! Also, the sharpen function works pretty, pretty bad!!I don't understand why releasing to market software with these kinds of bugs in features that are used the most if they were working perfectly on version 9?I returned this very expensive (""very"" poor price/performance) software to buy other program where all the editing functions work as they should!!"
3,Microsoft Digitial Image Pro,I purchased Microsoft Digital Image Pro 10.0 as I had lost my original copy.When I received it I saw that it had originally been purchased by a Microsoft Employee and had the Sticker that said that it was not to be resold. Whoever sold this scratched out the employee name and number and illegally sold it.The produce was new and had not been opened.
5,JORDAN CRAY ROXX!,"JORDAN CRAY ROXX!I'VE READ DANGER.COM #1,2,3,4,5,6 AND I ANM GONNA READ #7, MOST WANTED. I AM TELLIN YOU I GOT THE FIRST ONE AT A LOCAL BOOKSTORE FOR 99 CENTS AND FINISHED IT IN 4 1/2 HOURS! I REPEAT THIS BOOK ROXX! ALL YALL ACTION FANZ GO GET IT!"
5,One Book Report,For my summer reading report I decided to read The Last Shot by Darcy Frey. This book was amazing. I have read a lot of good books as a student. I learned so many new things and I now I understand the life of people living in the inner-city. Recomended to anybody who likes sports!
3,ILL At Will V.2,"This is a decent mixtape album from Redman. Flows in & out of tracks nicely and all around put together good. A few freestyles on here as well. I'm a fan of Redman so this is a nice addition to my CD Library. I still think ""Dare Iz A Darkside"" and ""Muddy Waters"" are his best albums, but he has alot of good material out there. I was looking for something that i have never heard from him before to pick up so i got this. If you dig Redman you will probably like this Cd. It is worth a listen."
4,Great but needs to specify item,"This item is really great, well made, etc. The only problem is that in the picture it shows the full pant and shirt instead of one or the other. I ordered it, thinking it came in a set...but the only thing that came were the pants. They need to specify exactly what they are selling. Maybe I made the mistake, who knows...Im satisfied...but I just wish it wouldve came with what the picture had shown."
2,Long John,When I looked at the picture of the long john before I purchased it I thought it was the whole set. The only thing I received was the pants. I was very disappointed that I only got the pants for over twenty dollars. I felt deceived.
4,"More ""best"" to Oscar's repertoire, but this is a good start","I love the way Oscar interprets a tune, so naturally I had to pick up this transcription book. This book includes the following 18 songs: A Child is Born, The Continental, The Girl from Ipanema, Gravy Waltz, I'm Old Fashioned, It Ain't Necessarily So, Little Girl Blue, Love is Here to Stay, Moanin', My One and Only Love, Noreen's Nocturne, On the Trail, Over the Rainbow, Place St. Henri, Rockin' Chair, Round Midnight, Stella by Starlight, and Sweet Georgia Brown.Oscar's got far more ""best"" songs than these mere 18, but given the dearth of Oscar transcription books out there, I'm satisfied with this collection. There's also a nifty discography, which lets you know exactly what album and which version of a song is transcribed in the book.The transcriptions are somewhat challenging to play (or at least to a novice player such as myself), i.e. if I start to learn ""The Continental"" now I'll eventually master it by 2012 - can't wait!"
3,Not a New Title from Elizabeth Moon,"I was disappointed to find that this was just a compilation of three books: Hunting Party, Sporting Chance, and Winning Colors. That was not clear from the purchase page.The print size is good, and the pages and cover appear to be a decent quality."
2,Horses in space,"This book is an easy read. The adventures are simple, but(in the first of the three parts)it shows a bit of the development of certain characters.In a way this really is a horse-loving adventure book more suited to girls who are at that age."
4,She loved it!,My daughter has had the Dora Super Babies for 2 yrs now but they were getting really dirty looking despite our best attempts to keep them clean. These new PJ's have been great. They cover the twins stained underclothes and my daughter is learning how to dress them.
4,Stunning performances by Dunaway and Scarwid,"Say what you want, but I love this film. Faye Dunaway WAS Joan Crawford, and she just went for broke in this role. I don't think that the child abuse sequences were funny, but it did illustrate very well how insecure and deranged Crawford had to be. My favorite scene from the film is when Joan shouts at the teenaged Christina: ""Why don't you give me the respect I deserve?"" And Christina answers back through gritted teeth: ""Because--I'm--not--one--of--your--fans! "" And Joan just starts screaming like a banshee and attacks Christina...in the middle of an interview for REDBOOK Magazine, yet. The reporter had to break up the fight! Whoa! Very engaging film."
1,mommie dearest dvd,the dvd arrived quickly but when I tried to play it it didn't work in my player. Not that big of a deal I didn't pay much for it. Besides I think it was used.
3,"A DISTUBING, HILARIOUS LAUGHFEST","If you take this movie at face value, it is just plain bad. If you add the camp appeal, it is a classic ! There are so many great lines from this movie - and such bad acting. My personal favorite is Christina telling her Mother ""That is a LIE !"" followed by two slaps across the face from Joan. Faye Dunaway does not understand to this day why this movie all but decimated her career. The answer, Faye darling, ""You went too far."" Other campy moments are ""Get the GD Company (Pepsi) to pay the bills,"" ""Don't F*@K with me fellas,"" and, of course, the wire hangers."
5,Mommie Dearest (Hollywood Royalty/Special Collector's Edition),Giving this a 5 star because I've looked EVERYWHERE for it and this was the LAST COPY to be found (at the time of purchase).It's a Christmas gift for my daughter (yes I have a sick sense of humor). She wanted it but said she never found it ... SURPRISE SURPRISE SURPRISE
4,Brilliant,"This is a great DVD and John Waters' commentary is great. If you love this movie, you should purchase the Hollywood Royalty edition. It's fun!"
5,Dunaway at her Best role ever!,"I have seen this movie so many times, and each times, I love it over and again, even after reading the book.This is Faye Dunaway at her best..........and scariest.A sure recomandation for this DVD!"
1,Sent it back.,"I ordered a Large top - I received a Small Petite!!! I had ordered it for my son who is in the military. He gets really cold under his uniform and I cannot afford to spend a lot of money. This was on sale - it was back ordered - which I was okay with. But, when I received it a month later, it was the wrong size. What was the point of sending one? My son was home on leave and I had hoped to be able to send him off with a warm top to wear under his uniform. That did not happen."
2,One of the worst I have seen,"I rented it because Michael Madsen was in it. After viewing it, I wish he was not in it. I have enjoyed his acting in other movies and a TV show but in this he ridiculously overacts. I wonder if the rest of the cast broke out in laughter after doing some scenes. Vulgar, poorly acted. Just a poor excuse of filmmaking in every way."
1,So so bad....,"Who the hell green-lighted this thing? Absolutely horrendous. Unless you've got a serious man-crush on the kid from Terminator, there's nothing to see here. The only positive thing in the whole film was how hilariously bad of an actor Michael Madsen is. Still not worth the time I'll never get back."
4,Great addition to tool kit,"This socket set is really helpful to me in my job as an assembler. Bicycles come with a multitude of bolts and screws, and the more options I have, the better."
5,BUY IT,"When I used to back the boat or trailer my wife always used to guide me - c'mon, c,mon, c'mon, STOOOOOP. To close, bent tag, not close enough, real pain in the butt.Now, with this little gem, I can put the ball under the hitch in one shot, every time. Best idea and investment I have made in a while."
5,My Winter birds love it!,"I have no problems with it at all, we have been stuck in the deep freeze for over two months and my winter birds have fresh water to bathe and drink, I change the water every day and along with plenty of seed I have some very happy birds. Have seen many new and wonderful birds in my back yard, they are such a joy to watch!"
3,Take the bracket out of the box and put it in the trash can,"Do NOT purchase this product if you want to use the tilting feature. I purchased this product two years ago when our old heated bird bath stopped working and it has worked very well. It keeps the water above freezing so our feathered ""kids"" have plenty of water during the nasty winter months. As an engineer by trade, the bracket is a great idea but a POOR design. However, the bath itself sits on the 2x8 rail of our deck and does exactly what we want it to do."
2,Don't bother with this one.,I am very disappointed in the quality of this item. The plastic doesn't hold the metal screw holder ( doesn't that make sense?) and the metal tube meant to keep the screw tightened comes out of the plastic. It is difficult to mount on the railing as a result.SAVE YOUR MONEY. THIS IS GARBAGE.
1,Hard to install and does not balance,I purchase this with hope of making sure the birds in my area had the necessary water. However the bird bath is very difficult to mount and it top heavy. I could not even think of a way to make adjustment. I finally package it back up and sent it back. Don't waste your money buying this bird bath.
4,Priceless Footage - Too Short!,"There is only one thing that would make this video better, full episodes instead of selected songs. The average is 80 minutes in length which is CD, NOT DVD length. It is a waste of space. Regardless, the footage brings back great memories."
1,Did Not Work For Us,"This item just did not work for us!First, the directions for putting it together are printed very small and are quite difficult to follow.Second, wonce on our tow vehicle, we spent a great deal of time arranging the mirror for towing. Before we left the drive way, gravety pulled the mirror toward the ground. Repeatedly, we would stop, tighten the screws/bolts, and within a mile we had a good view of the road. Even after our trip, the hour I spent trying to tighten the mirror proved pointless.Needless, to say, we towed out pop-up without extended mirrors. Unfortunately, we cannot recommend this mirror for purchase."
4,Men and our identity,"It has very good views on problems that exist in the gay community that deals with family issues and working out there own problems. ""This Place of Men"" is asking us to identify the place that we have in our community by confronting the reality of our sexual identity and make a stand for these principles."
5,Delightful,"This is a great photo book. I received my copy a couple of days ago and was very pleased. I think the photos are sweet. The book has a wonderful mix of babies, all taken by amateurs. There are a few photos that will definitely make you laugh and giggle. Everyone who has seen it loved it! Good job!"
4,Very Cute !,"I have a copy and think is so cute. We think is so ridicules for someone to try and review a book..... and not even have read it. Read it! I agree with ""Wow"" Get the book and then review! Give me a break! Some of this is just dumb!Get a Life!"
5,Nicely Done!,"This book is a warm and amusing. Some of the photos are a little rough, I guess because of the fact that amateurs took most of the pictures. There are some lovely pictures. I will be ordering an additional copy for my daughter's hope chest."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this book b/c my daughter's picture is in it. [...] I would maybe pay $10 for this book. Many of the pictures are dark and hard to see the child at all. It was not the quality of book I was expecting.
2,Redundant if you have the Singer Property Casebook,"If you use the Singer Casebook for property, you're not going to get much more out of this hornbook. Unlike most casebooks, Singer's is actually pretty good at laying out the black letter law and emphasizing policy tidbits in the notes. Could be helpful if you don't use the casebook though...Started with this book; now I've been using Gilbert property outline, and go straight to my professor with policy questions. Worked well so far"
3,"Good, but a little disappointing","This book was good overall. However, I was a little disappointed because it hyped me up for the big finale at the Wolfe Christmas party, but when I got there all I could say was ""that's all"". I looked for a little more drama at the end. I could have read what happened the next christmas party instead of going through all that. OK read."
3,Eh...It was Alright. Slightly a disappointment,"When I first started the book, I was enjoying it. But towards the end, it got really dull. There was entirely too much going on at one time. The characters backgrounds were too deep to just vaguely tell their stories, and that's what Zane did. Seems as if the whole thing was rushed. In actuality, each character could have a book all their own. Ever heard the term ""hit or miss""? This book was definitely a miss. And I love Zane! But, this is not her best work."
3,"A friend went on and on ""you have to read this book""","...well, I should have considered the fact that it was her first nonrequired book. It wasnt bad, just wasn't that fantastic."
2,Once your on to do you stay on top?,This book is off the hook. Zane does a great job at building each charter. They are a real lively bunch. Tomalis Wolfe (one of severaly charter) can take them up but how many will he put down to size. You have to check it out
4,Used as Textbook,"HAd to have this as a Textbook for ME136N at the University of Texas via correspondence study from Oklahoma State University as ENGR 4211. I learned little from it, if you don't know anything about nuclear engineerng, you can learn a great deal from this book."
4,"Powerful yes, but...",This light is great. Small enough & very bright. Only complaint is that the lightning pattern is very tight (spot)... Would like it better if it was somewhat wider... bit more light to the sides would make it 5 stars.
1,Cateye quality is not what it used to be....,"My old cateye Halogen headlight (HL-500) was legendary in its toughness, 10 years with routine drops and spills. I can't say the same for the new OptiCube LED models. I've had both the HL-EL500 and the newer HL-EL530 LED lights stop working after falling only once from handlebar heights(just about 3.5 ft). Nothing visibly broken or cracked, no loose parts, just a $45-$55 paper weight. The problem is limited to the reflector/bulb housing unit, for which Cateye does not sell replacements, so once it breaks you have to replace the whole thing. No complaints about the brightness when it worked, but a bike-light needs to be tough and should withstand small drops at least as well as your average cell-phone. MagLite can make nearly indestructable and waterproof flashlights that sell for under $35, why can't CatEye? It's about time we stopped getting ripped off by bike light manufacturers."
1,Cateye headlight,I'm disappointed with this product because of: 1. It throws a round beam 2. Not as bright as I thought it would be. I have a maglight led flashlight that is way brighter.This product may be ok for the occasional slow speed (<5 MPH) bike rider
3,ok could be a lot better,Mount is weak-but when it does break it's fixable. Light is bright a bit too focused . Mount is the only weakness really though :
3,"Barry Nelson predates Sean Connery as 007 in""Casino Royale.""","In 1954, CBS broadcast a one-hour presentation of ""Casino Royale"" for its series ""Climax Mystery Theatre."" This original production, not the 1967 spoof, stars American actor Barry Nelson as Bond (often referred to as ""Card-sense Jimmy Bond"")and Peter Lorre as villain Le Chiffre. In this production, the American Bond is assisted by British agent Clarence Leiter! This is a pretty much by-the-numbers adaptation of roughly the first half of Ian Fleming's novel, and is merely adequate as far as thrills and action are concerned. Peter Lorre is, of course, the real gem here. For all its shortcomings, however, the original ""Casino Royale"" is worth watching for its sheer novelty, and the hints of grander things to come."
3,An interesting spoof of James Bond films.,"""Casino Royale"" is interesting especially after seeing the ""Austin Powers"" films. You can see many of the Austin comic influences, including Austin in the casino, the fembots, and the music. However, today the movie looks out of date."
1,piece of junk,The router is a piece of junk. Cannot sustain heavy loads - constantly reboots itself every two - three minutes. My experience is based on two of these routerts - both of them have shown the same behavior. Also has a bad design- huge green LEDs are annoying and distracting.
4,Gary Seven & Eugenic Wars,"Episode 55 is great, yet episode 56 is a dud. What's more, Seven & his secretary, Teri Garr, are xellent in the two novels, ""The Eugenics Wars"". Given, the books are far better than this episode. Yet, this does give key (& very eerie) clues to the future."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read.,"I have read previous titles by Ms. Hart and I am not impressed with Impulsive. The dialog between the characters is extremely poor, and this books suffers from a poor plot. I'm glad I bought it used. I'd give it zero stars if it was a possiblity."
5,A Wonderful Surfer's Biography,Mike Doyle was there for the best and worst of it all. I will keep this short. It is a great read for someone who wants to understand the mind of the early generation of California surfers. I loved every word and I think you will too!
3,Have to buy additional part,"This item shipped very quickly, but as soon as I opened the box I was hit with the instructions that, unless the heater was going into a metal pond, an additional part must be purchased. Otherwise the heat element will wander over to the side of the pond and supposedly cause a fire hazard, although I'm a lot more considered about it burning a hole in the liner. They give you the part number for the guard, but they just tell you to ask your ""dealer"" for the part. They didn't even list a website address or have a phone number to call. I did manage to find the corporation through a web search, and am able to order the part online for about $10. Still, this is a POND heater, and no ponds are made of metal. This mean everyone will have to buy the extra part, so they should have included it in the box."
2,The Bottom of the Barrel,"I have all of Junior Kimbrough's CD's, and think each one is a five star recording--EXCEPT this one. Fat Possum has a bad habit of releasing anything they have in their vaults, particularly if the artist has died (witness the awful--and accurate--reviews of Asie Payton's final album ""Worried"".) ""Meet Me In The City"" is a CD of cuts recorded at home, live at blues festivals--[heck], even in the shower, it sounds like. The quality of the recordings is [poor], and a couple of the songs you've heard before if you own all the Kimbrough Fat Possum releases (""Done Got Old"" and ""All Night Long,"" for instance.) For all that, you can easily hear the great bluesman Kimbrough was underneath the fuzzy background noise, sloppy editing & repetition. For collectors and purists only."
3,Okay controller,"THis is good because its wireless. but the glowing isnt that cool. it takes battery, which I guess is normal. its not the same as the regular controllers that came with the PS2, i didnt like it at first but i got used to it. The bad thing is that the x,o, square and triangle buttons are tall so its kind of hard to press and its kind of hard to hit two buttons quickly one after the other."
1,you get what you pay for,"I bought two of these and within one day the buttons were squeaking.The X button actually has already lost its ""spring"", so it just kinda sits there without bouncing back up.I am not much of a gamer, just something i do with my kids, but I think I have learned to go ahead and spend the bucks on the good stuff.However, they do look cool, just wished they performed well"
1,Not the sellers fault [i don't think],I received the item quickly. Exactly what I wanted except I have to return it because where the batteries go they have 2 negatives instead of 1 negative and 1 positive. This is not the sellers fault[i don't think] more the manufactures fault.
4,Economical solution,"I have been using clip on tow mirrors for several years. One came loose on a trip and I lost it. When I found this one I wasn't sure it would work as well, but the price was right so I ordered it. It was much easier to clip on than my previous mirror and so far seems to hold up well. I've used it on two camping trips, with considerable driving. It is easy to mount and adjust. It is a great, economical solution."
3,Good Not Great,"These mirrors do the job, but vibrate a lot and slowly slide out of place on our 2008 Explorer, they just don't adjust well to the new square mirrors like I imagine they would on the oval style, they did stay on for 5000 miles with one close call, the mirror was about to come off in traffic but we caught it."
3,"Maxell UR-60 Blank Audio Cassette Tape, 8 Pack","Haven't used it yet...so, I guess it's ok. I also have another...they're ok I guess. Will advise when I use them"
4,Good Stuff,Package arrived on time. Nicely plastic wrapped. Not yet used - but looks good. Had used before so ordered to keep in spare and can use it immediately if required. Would recommend to others.
2,Just a waste of time,"Great Apes was a waste of time to read. The author was obviously trying to comment on modern society through a ""Planet Of The Apes"" type gimmick, but the payoff isn't worth the effort. The author really doesn't have much of anything important to say, and comes off as more interested in painting a picture of what the world would be like if chimps were dominant, rather than saying anything new about what humans are like. It would have worked better as light reading sci-fi where the fantasy setting *is* the story. When I got to the end I thought ""Is that it?"". Self thinks he's pretty clever but the gimmick gets in the way. In the end, it wasn't worth my time."
3,"Vividly imagined, yet ultimately unaffecting","I have read both of Self's novels now, and two of his short story collections. ""My Idea of Fun"" was a well-crafted, bold statement of Self's purpose. Some of his short stories are quite good, but some suffer the same problem as does this novel, ""Great Apes"". He starts with an idea, really a premise with promise, yet it doesn't take off. Despite Self's very real writing skill and mastery of the English language, I found myself impatient with this book; I hoped it would develop more of its ideas to provide more insight into that paragon of animals, Human. Nothing fresh here except the somewhat clever premise. Too bad; I remain a fan, as I have come to expect this unevenness. Check out MIOF, though."
2,Don't bother.,I usually give a book 50 pages to get me hooked before giving up on it. For some reason I gave this one about 70 - it took that long to get into the interesting bits. The world as populated by chimpanzees was fascinating and enjoyably vulgar until it got repetitive. The book is interesting enough to keep reading - there were several intriguing parallels and some rather funny episodes -but is not good enough to recommend.
3,The boy can write .... but,"Will Self is exceptional at painting with words. He is a master of the English language with a quite supreme lexicon at his disposal. Unfortunately this does not make for a great read. When buying this book ask yourself: Do I want to be dependent on a dictionary in order to understand what he means? The book starts promisingly. In fact, I thoroughly enjoyed the first quarter. Sadly it seems that this was Mr. Self's own favourite part as the rest of the book suddenly becomes less polished, more lackadaisacal. The ending just seems to happen. Maybe that is the way he wanted it. Understated. Perhaps there was a message in there which I was not ""clever"" enough to grasp. So, not a bad book, but certainly not stunning. Worth reading for the bitter image portrayed of the London art scene. Only an insider could be this acerbic."
3,Drop Shot,"As is typical of Coben this novel is just okay. While often focuses on my basketball, he decide to write a book involving tennis stars."
2,Formula disease,"Although cleverly plotted and paced well, Mr. Coben has come down with the formula disease far too early in his career. In Drop Shot, I see paragraphs and scenarios that could have been cut and pasted from his two earlier novels. An enjoyable read, but not up to the standard Mr. Coben (and his many awards) have set."
4,Another Winner by Coben,"Interesting story by Harlan Corben. Good plot twists, colorful characters. It helps to know the back story of Myron and the gang but not mandatory."
3,Harmless,"Coben is one of the most gifted writers in the mystery genre and his Myron Bolitar series makes for good rapid reading. The stories have characters that are familiar to this series as well as some unpredictable twists that are thrown into the ploy. This is very fast reading from a writer who i so much more talented than the creator of the lifeless characters in this work. The book is certainly good fun and is extremely rapid reading even if it does not approach anything special. I much prefer the writes when reading books such as Just One Look, No Second Chance and The Innocent. It is in these books that the talent of the writer shines throgh and Drop Shot pales in comparison to these later works."
1,Cheap clockwork....,I really loved the look but without a counterweight on the minute hand it would lose time climbing toward the top of the hour.... and gain after the hour. I need a clock spot-on every minute.
4,Good from far...but you get what you pay for!,Ok...I wanted something that looks like a $200 time piece for $32 in my master bath. Well this one fits the bill.Close examination reveals plastic surround or fake dark wood ( oil rubbed bronze color) and printed paper dial for metal but hey it does it's job and keeps time!No complaints really!
1,Stop working!,The wall clock is beautiful but stop working after a few day!!!! I would like to return it as soon as possible. Bad product.
4,"The perfect ""I want to look like I'm a baller"" clock","You're considering buying this clock because it looks great, not because of its quality. Definitely made of cheap material, and I'm curious how long it will last. But it LOOKS great, very classy. 18-Inches is pretty big, so make sure you have the space. Print might look a little cheezy super up close since it's obviously a print and not an actual vintage clock... but who really is going to stand 6 inches from it. Definitely an attractive piece on my wall. Overall 4 stars, good purchase. The perfect ""I want to look like I'm a baller"" clock. Exactly what I was hoping for, until I can afford the real deal... ;)"
4,amazing for the price,These are very good knives. sharp. nice build. great price.the only reason i didnt give them a 5 star is cause im sure there are better knives out there . they just probably cost ten times the price.
2,Not a serious tool,"Its nice to work with a very sharp blade and all 3 of these knives meet that test. But serious knives need some heft to help them cut and these knives have none. The plastic handles are narrow, short and very light, making the user work too hard to cut anything but the softest foods. I should have known that the price was too low for a serious tool. Don't waste your money."
2,Cheap knives,"I bought this item based on the brand name. However, these knives are cheaply made and do not hold an edge. I'd look elsewhere for cutlery items."
3,OK for smaller hands,The blades are nice but I find the handles are a bit petite for my hands - something more along the lines of the girth of the fibrox handles on the Victorinox Chef's knife would have been appreciated.
1,"Shame, Shame, Shame","When I ordered these the description said the handles were Fibrox.Well, they are not. They are black nylon.I'm not happy!I'm only giving 1 star because it won't accept a 0 star rating"
2,"Good idea, but needs improvement!","The ""idea"" itself is good!Unfortunately, the mirrors do not extend out far enough for an 8 foot travel trailer; the mirrors are too small to see anything; the mirrors vibrate and sag while driving no matter how much you tighten them and you get wind whistle from the ""design"" of the mirror while driving over 40 mph!Sorry to say, I am not very happy with the mirrors for my 2008 Toyota Tacoma and I was hoping that this would solve my problem!Mike T."
2,Nice mirror. To bad the company doesn't sell any parts,"I have used this mirror for several years. Now the three rubber cups and the two hold down clips are getting old. A search of the internet and an e-mail to the company: no luck, no response. I had to make my own"
1,Very poor design.,Followed instructions and installed as directed. First trip down the road and they fell off and broke. A friend had the same pair - he put them on his truck one night and the next morning they were laying on the ground. They fell off without any driving!
5,Hauntingly appealing,"This is probably the most ""unusual"" CD in my collection. The music has the ability to conjure up feelings of fear in the pit of your stomach, or a sick feeling of impending doom, or an eery stillness in the world. In other words, the music really makes you FEEL something. Not necessarily light or happy feelings, but the ability with which this music affects me is so strong, I can't help but be drawn into it. I could see much of this CD being used on various movie soundtracks. I try to be open-minded in my musical taste, and once bought Aphex Twin's Drukqs CD. I listened to it a number of times, to give it a chance, but didn't like it at all. Mr. Brubaker's ... is completely different, so if you didn't like Drukqs, perhaps you'll like this one."
3,"An OK book on consulting, written sloppily","My time is very valuable and too much of it would have been required to read the whole book. I have to believe that this author knows what he's talking about, because he has been published many times, but I was not impressed with his writing style. It was very difficult to get into because he spent a lot of time focusing on what he was going to tell us later. By skipping pages and doing spot reading I did learn some, but there were too many typos and he was too wordy. I prefer the writing style of William Bond in Going Solo."
4,outisde dog kennel,"Instructions were easy to follow. Most of the assembly was done by just me (41yr old woman). My dog forced her way out, so I took the extra chain links apart and used them to run up and over the lower bar and through each of the lowest points on the chain link and its extremely secure. The only way I'd rate it even higher would be if the price were lower. All in all, best price I could find out there. We have the cover and anchors too, but I have not assembled them yet. The kennel is holding up fine without the anchors."
3,Worth Reading For The Little Extra Bits,"The novelization of all three films is in this omnibus.I found the Star Wars and the Return Of The Jedi stories the best of the three. There seemed to ba a little bit of consistency problems with the three novels as in Jedi, Chewie, Artoo, and others that speak different languages were formatted and written differently than the other two novels. Also in Jedi is the first time See-Threepio is written as C-3PO.Other than that they are pretty good. What I usually like about reading good novelizations is being able to read about what chatacters are actually thinking. There is that here as I get to know what Vader thinks, and Luke.Some intersting new stuff is introduced that you barely notice in the films (if they were in the films at all). For example Luke's best friend on Tatooine.If you are a Star Wars fan I recommend them. They are short tiny novels (all three are just over 400 pages total) so it's not going to take forever and they are easy reads."
4,great for the price,"I purchased this to be able to bring the family bikes camping with us. We have 2 mountain bikes and a teen boys bike. My bike is the heaviest so that one went first (it had to go caticorner to fit). Then the teen bike (his did not fit good so it went upside down) then the other mountain bike which was tight but went on. All three bikes fit good, was secure with not other tie downs. The rack did not rub, scratch or make any damage to my minivan. Overall well worth the money. We have only used it twice so far for about 90 minutes on small highways (which means potholes, etc...), but plan on using it more in the future."
1,Cheap holding buckle,"The first time I opened a buckle, the buckle tab broke off and the spring below it put a gash in my thumb.The buckle is extremely cheap. I took the 1"" x 1/2"" tab that broke off and I was able to break it in half again, using very little effort.This is one the buckles that holds the rack to the car. If these fail, the rack will fall off your car and onto the freeway.I am returning it."
3,Morse Code; Breaking the Barrier <ISBN 1891237195>,Great book but needs humor and some technical improvements
4,Real Life Teenage Drama,This is definately a good film for teens to watch with parents. Sometimes teens don't want to admit they're feeling peer pressure or are bullied and this films shows the drastic consquences of it.
5,Quality Tape,I bought this to tape music practice sessions. It does a very good job. Fast shipment. Highly recommended.
3,Good items but...,"I ordered seven Maxell 90 cassettes. They took nearly three weeks to go from Virginia to Maine. They were loosely packed (in their plastic cases) in the shipping envelope. One of the plastic cases was broken. I have used three of the cassettes so far, and one of the three jammed in the recorder (a handheld Sony). I was able to fast-forward the cassette, which I use for correspondence, in another machine. I was unable to get the cassette to move forward or backward in the Sony. Perhaps this was just a quirk of that opne cassette. They all appear to be new."
1,awful,"A dreadful thing to subject yourself to, reading this book. I like contemplative, thoughtful works, but I got no pleasure or inspiration from this long, painful trek. The author says this is the journal that he kept for a year, and that he made few changes to it for publication; that makes Kaddish an object lesson in why you shouldn't publish your own journal."
1,"lifeless, and an ordeal to read","This book is a great weariness to the soul. The author says it is the journal he kept over the period of a year after his father died, and says he made few changes in it for publication. He should have kept it as his journal, private and definitely unpublished. No, I couldn't read the whole thing, either."
2,Music Maniac,Should have been a one hit wonder or at the max two. Love two songs on the album but should have just bought the songs. Would have been cheaper. Just not satisfied in Gary Wright.
3,One good song -- lots of pop filler,"It's true that Gary Wright has impressive vocal skills. There are moments in this album when he almost sounds like Peter Gabriel. His range and expressiveness are startling.Unfortunately, the majority of the songs themselves are just the same old 1970s cliche pieces that many artists used when they needed to fill up an album. It's all eminently forgettable stuff. If it weren't for the chart success of ""Dream Weaver"", none of this would still be in print.It gets two stars for Gary Wright's voice, and another star because the price is so low."
3,too hard and sticky,"I usually buy Panda licorice, I liked this one because it was organic and came in a pack of 12 which made it a very good value, the taste was OK, but the crunch was too hard and too sticky"
4,Works Good,"I looked at Actron, Sun, AutoXray, and Equus. Settled on this as the best compromise between ability and price. Purchased to use on a '98 VW, 108k miles. It was sputtering badly and I had looked at several things to no avail. As soon as I hooked this up it gave me diag' codes for #1 and #4 cylinders misfiring. I now had a direction to look. The fuel injector connector for #1 was loose and the spark plug wire for #4 was high ohm. It's already paid for itself. They did fail to include the users manual CD but an email had it to me in less than a week. -b-"
3,Actron leaves much to be desired,"The Actron CP9180 Autoscanner Plus works as advertised. However, support for the product and drivers for my computer seem non-existant. After loading the attached CD-ROM onto my computer I found that there were no drivers for the device included. The Actron website also did not have any downloadable drivers. Therefore, I cannot update the scanner or use several features on the program. Also, When I tried to take advantage of the ""free automotive repair information for Actron customers"" from Repairpath.com (This came on an insert with the manual) I learned that nothing is for free. I also found that the Customer Service web address is no good."
3,Do not buy if you have a MAC (Apple) for Actron software updates.,I would give it 5 stars for the what you get for the money. No doubt it is one of the best scanners on the marketand it has done pretty much what I need it to do with my 2002 VW Passat. But it gets 2 stars taken away for nonsupport of Apple computers for updating the software on it. My household like many others here in the US arerunning MAC computers and Actron needs to get with it.
4,great item,"The Actron cp9180 works great. Since purchasing I have used it my truck and several friends cars. I love the record feature. However I can not get the software to work on my computer runing widdows Vista, I tried downloading an it from Actron's website still did not work. I have not contacted Actron to see if there is a fix because I'm not worried about that feature. The scanner having the long cord is great. I was able to hook up to my truck drive down the road having the scanner in an easy to read location."
3,Overrated,"The Actron CP9180 works but is not as advertised. The software to load on your computer is too old to load on windows 7. The Scanner says it is up to date but how do you keep it that wey when you cannot connect it to the computer for updates. I called and they have not decided when or if they will be doing an update. Bottom Line, this tools software looks like early 2000 software like Windows 2000 or older. I don't have new cars and wonder if it will work on a newer car."
5,Actron CP9180 AutoScanner Plus Diagnostic Code Scanner,"works great, already paid for itself within 2 weeks as I have several cars and kids with cars. Recommend it to any car savvy person."
3,Banco! describes the great victory of Charriere's life!,"Charriere's sequel to Papillon, while not as action-packed, is still a must-read for anyone who has read his first book. Papi describes the rebuilding of his life in Venezuela, a bungled bank robbery, his job as a jungle guide in the South American rain forests, the woman who became his second wife, and much more, all in the same simple yet elegant narrative style that made Papillon so enthralling.Most importantly, he tells of the resolution of his all-consuming passion for revenge upon the people who conspired to frame him for murder. It is the final triumph for a man who endured what most of us cannot imagine surviving. Benedictez-vous, Papi!"
5,Rare and Remarkable!,The bible stories burst into new life through Altmans exciting rendition for children. Jew and Christian alike can gain much appreciation from their little ones when they read from this book to them. Simply wonderful!!
4,So good for you but it smells and the taste needs to be acquired!,"In reading alot of the reviews on the Yogi Fasting Tea and the Yogi DeTox Tea and how people spit it out and yap what a horrible tea it is...I just have to say ""THESE ARE MEDICINAL TEAS PEOPLE!"" not lovely infused lemon peppermint cranberry strawberry etc etc or what have you. They are made from roots and dandelions and things that will make you HEALTHY! These medicinal teas are an acquired taste. I quite enjoy them hot or cold. My roommates scream whenever I brew a cup because it does have a rather stinky smell like medicine. Ha! But I feel great and I never get sick! You decide I guess."
3,No weight lost,"The taste is O.K., although I do not notice a difference in my appetite even when I use two tea bags."
2,Tastes like fennel,"This should be renamed Fennel tea. Because that's all I could taste. Yes, it is the first ingredient and I probably should have acknowledged that more, but its different than chewing on fennel seeds at the end of an Indian meal. It is Fennel. Strange and sweetened by licorice (which also has a pronounced taste).As a fasting tea, I came to see it as: if you force yourself to drink a cup before a meal, you will lose you appetite entirely. Effective, sure. But certainly unpleasant. I'd rather have a different cup of Yogi tea, like Egyptian Licorice or Gingko Clarity to take my mind off of eating and satisfy restless tastebuds."
1,Stay away from the phone,"I looked at this book because I wanted to see what strategy the jerk who interrupts me at dinner to sell me something I don't need would employ. I had the unfortunate experience of working for two telemarketing companies, and I got out just in time to save my soul. They prey on the weak, the elderly, and I was told that whatever I had to do to get the customer's attention (and money) was worthwhile. Blatant lying was not only accepted it was encouraged. So if you want to feed the monster, then check this book out and convince folks that there lives are not complete until they get your product. If you, like me, would like to preserve some dignity, find another job."
3,Stephan covers the basics......,"Stephan's book was quite vague in discussing options for dealing with the daily trials and tribulations of selling via telemarketing. Typically, this book wouldn't be very helpful to someone who has any sales experience or sales saavy. However, I would definetly suggest this book to someone that was in need of the basics on ""How to Sell."""
3,Get the Appointment,You don't have to read this book now. All you have to do is read the title of my review. Get the appointment. And how many calls does it take to get there. That is what this is all about. Good re-enforcer though for the seasoned Sales exec.
3,A so-so guide to cold calling...,"It's an OK book if you are completely new to cold calling. If you've had any experience with it, look elsewhere since this book is just about the basics. But since I got it really cheap using a coupon from UnderTag.com, I can't really complain."
3,Had to duct tape together,"The screws to hold legs together did not work so had to use duct tape. It held together ok then. Only problem is, no birds have used it. Not sure why. Maybe they get enough water from the snow."
1,Good for a couple days,"I bought this tv at a store called AmazingSavings (fomally OddJobs) it was priced for $199.99. i thought it was a great price for a flat screen, so I went price shopping, most 27"" flat screens where in the $220-$500 mark. So i went back to the store and bought it. The picture quality was great, for the first couple days. and on channels with a marquee (Fox News, CNN) the letters that are scrolling seem to get thin when they reach the middle and then real fat when it gets to the end. and now after 1 day it would start to ""blink"" going off and on real fast. and now it's REALLY blurry, i don't know if it's defective, but if if is defective the picture quality when it was working right, was really good!"
4,great vocals,"great vocals selections from Flo and Eddie, who, along with being the voices of The Turtles, have also sang backup with Frank Zappa, T Rex (yup, that's them in the background on Bang A Gong), and Bruce Sprinsgsteen (Hungry Heart), among others. As the other reviewers have stated, some of their best solo songs are not on this CD (I especially miss hearing ""Kama Sutra Time"", but what they hey.....)."
3,"Montevideo - Maybank, some memories of a southern Christian Houselhold.",The book is very short and touches on some of the unknown facts about the a Jones family. A couple of other family books have been read but little was know about the family after the finishing of or ending of The Children of Pride. Some of the sentence structure is difficult but understandable.
5,"USEFUL ITEM, NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE AT BRICK AND MORTAR",HAPPY TO LOCATE THIS ITEM FOR MY CLASSES. THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE AT A BRICK AND MORTAR. WOULD USE THIS SELLER AGAIN.
1,These Are Junk,Poor quality control. Tapes often rub on playing. Noise level is high. Use Fugi 90 minute tapes far better at slightly more cost
1,There is no real purpose behind this textbook.,"If you ACTUALLY wanted to learn Japanese, instead of just buying textbooks that only teach you the alphabet, why not buy the textbooks that teach the alphabet as well as 1-2 years worth of University class in the language! For this I'd highly recommend buying Genki 1, 2nd edition: an integrated course in elementary Japanese. An excellent jump-off point for self-studying.INSTEAD OF PAYING OVER 10 DOLLARS FOR SOMETHING YOU CAN EASILY LEARN OFF A GOOGLE IMAGES CHART IN 3 DAYS IF ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW IS HIRAGANA!"
5,Let's Learn Hiragana (Kodansha Children's Classics),It is a really great book for learning the Japanese syllabary - the Hiragana.The book provides ample space for a student to practice the syllables.If you are serious about learning this beautiful language - please use this book.It will show you correct stroke order for writing Hiragana.Take Japanese seriously - don't listen to idiotic Otaku fans.This book will create interest in the language - you will then proceed on tolearning Kanji. Which is a different story.Wish you all best in learning.
5,Unbelievable-especially for the size,"The breeze that comes out of this fan is super-especially for its size. Will easily service a medium size bedroom.It is high velocity and ""blows"" away larger turbo plastic monster fans."
3,Overall okay but could be more in-depth.,I read this book very quickly and thought it did a fairly good job of telling the reader about Charlie D's life. My main complaints are that I felt there had to be more people that could provide information on Charlie D then just the few mentioned. I would also like to know what happend to the surviving family members?
1,CD PLAYERS DO NOT WORK & NO BPM COUNTER!,This mixer does not have a BPM counter AT ALL. AND the cd players do not read burned cds. I plan to sell my mixer and will think twice before I buy another Numark product. This thing is a piece of junk.
2,Not Worth My Time,"Ponderous writing. A beautiful cover does not make a great book.This was a compelling story virtually ruined by poor writing. I gave up after the people were rescued and should not have read even that far.For those of us who are fascinated by stories of the sea and phenomenal ocean rescues, read ""A Night to Remember,"" ""Saved!, the Story of the Andrea Doria,"" and ""Almost Too Late."""
2,A mild disapointment.,"The pictures were lovely. The poetry added little. Twelve more words: word, word, word, word, word, word, word,word, word, word."
2,Not much Brigitte Bako,"The story is okay. The movie is watchable, but if your hoping to see Bako in the flesh... don't bother buying this. You see more skin in Strange Days, which is a better movie. I guess the only reason it was rated R was for the very small amount of violence and swearing. Interestingly enough in the ""Extras"" material, the movie is listed as PG-13."
3,"The weakest of the three volumes, but still okay","Rhino did three of these volumes of beach music classics in the early 1990s, and like the other two, there are too few songs here. But it's a decent collection, and all three cds together make a very nice set with some hard to find gems. This is probably the weakest collection of the three, but still okay."
4,Simania,"The Sims is a fantastic game, and I had wanted it for a long time. Every time I saw it it was for Windows and PC. So I was pretty excited when I found it in a tiny MAC shop. The first night after I bought it, I made a single sim named Monica who moved into a one room bachelor pad. Monica now lives in a mansion with her husband and three kids. The surprising thing is that I did it all without a cheat code. The Sims truly is a game of strategy. I have pushed relationships to the extreme (marriage) and others to the lowest (Coronation Street style fights). I have made kids get A's and go to military school. I have made people who go to work in limousines.And I am still no Sim pro. In other words, one does NOT need cheat codes to get their Sims to the top. This game is definitely worth your while."
2,The Sims,"Wow I was expecting to love this. Unfortunatly that didn't last long. The problem is that there isn't enough time in the Sim's dayto do everything they need too. To keep my Sims going to work and paying the bills they got behind on socializing and got sodepressed that they wouldn't answer the door when a visitor came over.The real problem is that if left alone they would never do anything that they needed to (like work), so you can't leave the gamegoing overnight unattended - like other Maxis games."
3,Intresting work,"Pretty good work from a true genius,one of the pioneers on this cult label,just as Luke Vibert.He has done some other exelent works under the name Cylob.Check out all the Rephlex titles! Do it now!!"
5,The message the Christian church must hear (again) today,"This book is amazing in terms of being clear, inspiring, and aimed squarely at the errors the church is plagued by today. Its focus is on God's work in salvation and our own tendency to try to build up our own role. Horton exhorts clergy and laymen alike to examine their assumptions and belief in light of Biblical truth, yet he does so with good humor and a fresh perspective that is motivating, not critical"
2,Not much for your money,"I received this as a gift for Christmas. I'll start by saying the game itself is interesting and fun -- if you can actually get enough people together to play. You have to have at least 5 people. Also, you hardly get anything for the amount of money you spend -- you get a tiny box, and the only contents are a stack of cards and one fold-out page of instructions.The cards only serve to let players know what role they play (villager, cult member, seer, etc.) You could easily just write the roles on pieces of paper. The rules are incredibly simple (they fit on a single small piece of paper), so that gameplay is very limited.Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It feels more like the kind of game you can find directions for free online. Again, this isn't really a board game, and it isn't really card game, as the cards don't really serve any purpose once you are assigned your role. If you pay $20 for this, you're going to be disappointed when you open the box..."
2,So-so musical,"This musical starts with every cliche in the movies and keeps adding more. It has an Italian barber who wants to get his Greek nephew into a Broadway production (I guess the scriptwriter regarded all European ethnic groups as interchangeable). Add to this his involvement with a couple of real dodos who spend on personal items all the money he gave them for betting on a horse in a steeplechase. They meet a handsome Broadway producer and his wealthy financier as well as a cute dancer and singer who is trying to rescue that horse when the financier discards him for injuring a tendon. Every song is lackluster with the exception of Judy Garland's ""Dear Mr. Gable"".In fact, the horse and Ms. Garland are the only reasons to endure this musical. Even Robert Taylor's scenes fail to capture much interest. Watching ""Broadway Melody of 1938"" only reminds me of why I like ""The Goldwyn Follies"" from that time period so much more. At least that one had George and Ira Gershwin."
5,Brilliant,"Written in 1956 by one of the masters of the murder/detective genre and brought back on Kindle for a revival. Incredibly well written with massive detail and psychological insight. It portrays the crime from three viewpoints: the victim's, the killer's and the main detective's. I found it got progressively more powerful as the story unwound. It was his first novel, and though he slipped in popularity, this offering gives a new audience the opportunity to discover his genius."
5,Petmate Fresh Flow Filter 3 pack,Filter for a pet dish that works great but can not get filters locally. Glad to find them still on Amazon. Sure saves buying a new water dish. Quick service
2,Not like they used to be,"These are junk! I used this type of water fountain 6 years ago. I have recently come back to it, and am disappointed at how flimsy the filters now are. They used to have a hard plastic frame inside the filter,and you could actually hear the charcoal when it was activated in water. Now, I'm hard pressed to believe that there is any charcoal in there at all! I don't really need to filter water, as I have a well, but cats being what they are, love to play and ""rinse"" their feet in the water. Lots of big chunks get into the water, as well as fur. This filter will control the debris, but for someone who is filtering less desirable water, these filters may not stand up to the test. Too bad the price isn't lower for these cheap things."
1,Petmate Fresh Flow Filter don't like them.,After ordering and using the new form of Petmate Fresh Flow Filters I can say that I'm not happy with them at all. I find that after a few hours the back side of the filter becomes slimmy and I must rinse it out. I am afraid to use the filter more than once because of the slime factor that occurs in just a short while. I have no idea how much bacteria is being held within the filter. I feel that my only option is to change out my Petmate Fresh flow fountains for some other brand if I can only purchase the new filters. In all honesty I didn't want to give this new type of filter any stars for its rating.
2,hrm,"It gets a 3 star because I'm not sure that it is working all that well. It's been 3 weeks and I have not really seen any changes to the filter. The water flows passively through the system, but there is no force pushing the water through the filter per se. So I'm not completely sure it is filtering, rather than just taking the path of least resistance around the filter. but cats are still drinking the water (albeit a bit less than initially) and still prefer it to fresh water in a bowl even after 3 weeks.ADDITIONAL INFO:The water filter itself broke after about 6 months of use. So unfortunately I have a bunch of filters and nowhere to use them. I've taken off another star for this."
1,Didn't like it!,I sorry to say but I was very disappointed in this video. Maybe someone else will find it useful but it didn't serve my purpose.
2,Not thrilled with video,"Video is done well, but not really thrilled with the exercises because I found the majority of them on the internet.. for free. So,if I were you,I would save my money, do a little searching on the net and be just as satisfied."
2,disappointed,"Gene runs a web site which we reviewed, and we read his book as well. We booked a ranch -- Wit's end--based on his book review, and the great web site for the ranch. It was a bad experience. It is impossible, so far as I can tell, to write and post a negative review on Gene's site. It appears he takes commissions for booking people into the places he writes up. So beware. The mystical person who appears on the cover of the book likely does not exist. It is a sales document, so that he can get commissions booking people to the ranches. Go back and read the book and you will see there is not one negative comment in it, just as there are no negative comments allowed on his web site."
3,"Sturdy, but small","The backpack is really sturdy and good quality, but it is a bit small for me and the front pocket is too small and not deep or wide enough. The pack in general is too narrow but would be good for small day trips or Hikes where you do not necessarily need to pack a lot of stuff. The water bottle mesh side pockets are great."
2,Mrs. Ike Memories and Reflections,The book was interesting but longer than needed for the subject. I enjoy reading historical novels that focus on the lives of families. This was not the best.
2,Disappointed...false advertising...,"Being a big fan of wrestling I'd expected alot more from this DVD. Yeah sure there are some great moments and footage picked for this DVD but I know there was alot better moments on Raw that could've been chosen for this set. Also, I was reading the back of the DVD case and noticed for instance on DISC, one of the moments on the DVD would have Big Show chokeslam the Undertaker through the ring, and on Disc 3 it would have Vince's paternity test but it wasn't on the DVD. What the hell is with that. Overall it's an ok dvd to the add to the shelf, but the fact there is missing footage, really pisses me off..."
1,WORST OF RAW KEEP IT IN THE STORE,"WWE: The Best of RAW 15th AnniversaryTHE WWE WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER OFF IF THEY DIDNT SELL THIS PRODUCT BUT DO A TWO NIGHT SERIES OF EVENTS LEADING UP TO PRESENT DAY. EDITED, CHOPPED TO BITS AND TRIMMING LEFT ALL OVER THE CUTTING ROOM FLOOR. MATCHES, WHERE WERE THEY? I'M LUCKY I DIDNT BUY THIS DVD, I BORROWED IT AND MY FRIEND WISHED HE HADNT GONE TO BEST BUY THAT DAY."
1,not a good disc,"I have never had a problem with dvd order through amazon. unfortunatly, I hadn't viewed the dvd until recently, and it will not play in any of my players and it's not my players. And I no longer have the receipt for the dvd. I'm at a lost on just what I can do to get a good dvd of this movie without it costing me additional funds. Disappointed in dallas."
1,DISC WILL NOT PLAY,"BUYER BEWARE! I purchased the ""Cabin in the Sky"" DVD in June. Due to my busy schedule I only just recently tried to view it. It would not play in my brand new high end player nor would it play in my old DVD player or my computer. Zip, zero, nada.I read the reviews (which I should have done before my purchase) and found I am far from alone in this problem. Unfortunately, it's past its return date so I'm stuck with it and can't get a refund --- but at least I can warn others (that would be YOU, fellow Amazon buyer).IF YOU MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS DISC test it immediately!"
1,Did not work,"I opened the dvd, put in in the dvd player, and it would not load. I cleaned it, and tried again. I tried it in another dvd player: no dice. I'm guessing something went wrong in manufacturing."
1,This Seller Sucks!!,I ordered this DVD along with some other items on the same day from different sellers. I never received this item and I contacted the company to let them know. They in turn responded saying that it had been shipped and delivered. I told them that maybe it had been delivered to the wrong address because I never got it. All of the other products I ordered on the same day had been shipped and received in a timely fashion. I have not heard anything from the seller since. I am glad that I did not pay much for this DVD. I will never order from this company again.
5,A hidden gem; the very best of AD&D fantasy,"Upon finding out this book is no longer in print, I felt upset-- upset that so many lovers of fantasy literature will never be able to read it. Fans of AD&D novels who are forgiving of the weaknesses of the genre will be shocked to find those weaknesses missing here. DRAGONWALL is a study of a man who struggles; he struggles between duty to empire and duty to his ancestry, love of family and love of emporer, and the hateful but necessary arena of politics versus the glorious but hardship-ridden theatre of war. Stunningly, this book satisfies on a variety of levels; the intrigue of court politics is intricate and suspenseful, the scenes of battle are breathtaking and involving, and the personal struggles wracking the protagonist make you understand him deeply. You will admire him and suffer with him. If any ""fantasy"" novel can bridge the gap between entertainment reading and literature, this is the one. Try to find it--it's incredible."
3,Save your money,The info contained in this book could have been done in 50 pages. Constant repeating of info throughout the book. The photos are not good at all. It's OK but just OK and nothing more. Disappointed!
2,Weak on repairs and textures,"Great if you want to hang your own drywall but I'm working as a handyman. All of my work is repairs and patches, was hoping to get more efficient repair techniques and tips for finishes. Both seem to be after thoughts."
1,1999??,"I want a book for Thailand. I like Moon Handbooks, but 1999 just doesn't cut it. Sadly, I will likely get the LP giude."
4,great stuff from one of techno's true innovators,"This disc surely shows Surgeon's most accessible side. Rather than the twisted ambient tracks and disassociating metallic loops found on basictonalvocabulary and Balance, which, don't get me wrong, are Mr. Child's great strong suit, he attacks here with a deeper style. Hidden beneath his powerful shuffling drum loops are spooky vocal abstractions (some breathing sounds!), deceptive tribal rhythms, and screeching electronic noise (a product of his industrial Birmingham residence), bringing to mind a deranged primal ceremony somewhere deep in the jungles yet-unexplored. The fierce qualities end up losing the battle, however, as he winds up the album with a beautiful Detroit-styled jam with washing chords and light percussion. Check this disc out for a great piece that is a very listenable 50 minutes long and a very cohesive album."
2,WHERE'S THE REST OF THE CONCERT ?,"Although Ms.Brightman's voice is superb in ""LA LUNA"" live, the actual production of the VHS fails in comparison to ""ONE NIGHT IN EDEN."" I hope that the VHS is re-issued with more concert tracks. The end of the VHS concert is choppy with bad editing on Moon River and Con Te Partiro. Figlio Perduto and Question of Honour were both excellent, yet had that choppy effect. You can tell you're missing something."
5,A MUST HAVE!!!,"Having also purchased the VHS to this, the DVD is by far the better deal! I am amazed--over 90 minutes of all kinds of backstage footage and interviews! You really see the kind of down-to-earth, easily pleased person Sarah is. There is nothing you miss here, the entire concert, bonus music video for whiter shade of pale, tons and tons of rehearsal, photoshotos, and interviews, all narrated by Sarah herself. If you like Sarah Brightman and want to get to the know the star behind the performance-there is nothing out there better than this!"
5,Sarah's La Luna,"Who isn't enchanted by this diva's mesmerizing voice! Also, her beauty and theatrical talent is second to none. I have several CDs and DVDs. All I can say is ""wow""!"
5,It does the job,"I am learning to take pictures with ND filters. This filter does the job but the glass is not completely tied within the ring. There is a little bit of movement there. Not that the glass will come out or anything but you feel it when you clean the filter.(I live overseas, so returning merchandize is our of the question. Unless, of course, it is totally defective and its price justifies the shipping costs. So far, I've been very lucky)."
2,made for TV slop,"Amazon is dishonest to put a clip of John Wayne's ""Red River"" under the Video on Demand ""Red River"" which stars James Arness, not John Wayne. I want my money back!!!"
3,Exposition on Hebrews 11,"Morgan's exposition of the people, events, and circumstances found in Hebrews 11 is thorough. He goes into detail in the teaching on these matters of faith, covering personalities, the struggles they faced, and the way they overcame challenges in their time. However, I found difficulty in some of his ""unorthodox"" explanations. More evidence is needed. He fails to make a convincing case in those matters."
1,Lips Like Sugar the only hit,The rest is pretty BORING. Amazing how a group can produce one fantastic song and not be able to follow it up with anything nearly as good.
5,Brilliant,"Sorry, but I don't understand the negative reviews. This book is so well, so completely conceived, it really has few peers. Hilarious, too. There are more projective/predictive ideas in the first chapter than in most writer's entire oeuvres. It makes perfect sense to me and I am awe at an author who has such a vivid, logical, and prolific imagination. Well written, too, in a gonzo way.Incidentally, the boppers aren't robots, exactly. They are more like self-programmable, sentient, artificial protoplasm... with good senses of humor, no less (well, some of them).Highly recommended."
1,tasteless arrangements,"Peter Huttlinger has technique, that's for sure. But I like none of his arrangements on this DVD. His style doesn't make me want to play like him. He plays very fast... but so what? To me, his music says nothing. It's empty. Homespun has another DVD entitled ""Arrangements in Fingerstyle Guitar"" with Muriel Anderson. It's far better than Peter's even though her playing on it sounds sloppy at times. It's not like her. She's usually a perfect guitarist. She must have been in a hurry to finish the filming."
4,Very helpful with the basics of breast feeding.,"Breastfeeding basics are helpful, but I wish she would have talked a little more about managing breast feeding, like alternating baby holds to ease on soreness or more detail about alternating breasts for feeding and why that is important. This may not be sufficient for the woman who plans on nursing and returning to work. Still it was good for easing some of the fears about the process."
3,Frankenstein is The Creature from hell.,"In this episode of Frankenstein the baron has become so obsessed with his own hatred and anger that the character loses much of the dimension from the previous films. He murders without hesitation, blackmails a young couple into assisting his work and brutaly rapes the woman. The violence of this movie distracts somewhat from plot and character development. The treatment of the creature is much more sympathetic- he is a human victim of the Baron and not a monster. The film has some entertainment merit but is not for the weak of heart."
3,Average Printer at best,"The printer works fine for the most part. Had no difficulty setting it up on my Windows XP desktop. The print quality is fine. The only difficulty I have with it is sometimes the paper does not feed successfully from the paper tray and I get a loud clicking noise. This noise is the gears slipping in the mechanism that lifts the paper up to be fed from the tray, this is an occasional problem that comes and goes so I have elected to live with it. My last printer was also a refurbished Brother 1440 and it worked great for 5 years till the kids threw it off the top of the filing cabinet. This one works, but I'm not greatly impressed with it."
3,great little printer,"I needed a simple B&W printer to meet basic needs, was tired of the constant clogging of the ink jet. The printer works great, it networked easily with my airport, and I had no problems setting it up on my macs. I have two minor comments about the printer. First, the paper tray needs juggling to get it to seat properly. It took a bit of effort to get the paper to feed correctly. Second, for the price of this refurbished model I could have purchased the newer replacement model. Unfortunately, I overlooked it in my amazon search."
2,Well...,"This may not be the kind of music I like to listen to, but it's OK. It is entirely electronic and I would describe the music as one of my friends said ""under water music"". I can't recommend it the metal fans, but if you like to relax this is the CD for you."
1,Advisory!! DO NOT BUY,"Cheap junk, poor quality tools. when I took it out of package and opened the kit tools were out, case doesn't hold tools very well at all. I used the socket wrench once, and the gears inside broke, also a socket cracked and one of the wrenches bent while working on my car. Might be cheap, but you pay for what you get in most cases."
2,A short film with lots of wakeboarding,"This film is actually 24 minutes long - not 74. The story is rather silly but it tries. A young lady is competing in a local wakeboarding competition whilst living at home with the cliched drunk dad. Throw in some teen angst, some fun wake stunts and you have yourself a film that finishes before it starts.There are some deleted scenes from an unrelated film that follow and a preview of another. Sound is bad, picture is horrible, but I would recommend it to those teens looking for some cool (albeit brief) wake footage."
1,Cheap glass- total distortion on pasenger door,"This mirror looks good and it matched the mirror on my Chevy El Camino. It was easy to install. It was inexpensive. So much for its good points! Installed on the passenger side of an automobile, the distortion rivals most amusement park fun house mirrors. Unbelieveable! It might function properly on the driver's side of the car but on the passenger side...no way!"
2,Who spiked the egg nog?,"As a Spike Jones fan, I was seriously disappointed with this album. Practically none of the album is done in Spike's zany style. Most of the songs are sung by a choir in a ""serious"" style. I guess it's okay for what it is, but I personally find it to be very boring. Spike's old band the City Slickers are absent from this album, with the exception of George Rock, who sings a few songs in his ""little boy"" voice. The songs sung by George are the highlights for me, although his ""All I Want For Christmas is My Two Front Teeth"" is not the classic hit version, but rather it's a vastly inferior rerecording. He also sings ""My Birthday Comes on Christmas"", ""Angel in the Christmas Play"" and ""Santa Claus' Son"". These are okay novelty songs, with ""Santa Claus' Son"" being the best of them. I can't recommend this album, unless you happen to like choral singing."
2,Completely Ruined!,"This DVD might have been very good if someone would whisper in Pete Wernick's ear that he is NOT, repeat, absolutely NOT a singer. Why oh why then does he go and completely ruin this DVD by singing self-indulgently along to the tracks? And I do mean singing in the most God-awful way - like sandpaper on a blackboard.This is a banjo tutorial DVD for goodness sake, not the place to make us suffer the worst vocals this side of the Appalachians (or any side of it).I really just don't get it and I've never had this on many other banjo DVDs I've bought."
2,My least favorite Thomas book,"I loathe reading this book to my kids. I might judge it less harshly if it were just about a random train, bus, and helicopter, but it isn't a random book--it purports to be a Thomas the Tank Engine book, and as such it should be better. The story doesn't match the characters as they're developed in better Thomas books; the text rhymes sometimes, but not most of the time; the rhymes, when they occur, are mostly simplistic doggerel without any of the fun cleverness of most children's rhymes; alternately, for the purpose of forcing some of the story into the pointless randomly occurring rhymes, unnecessary and jarring exceptions are shoehorned in (Percy doesn't really rhyme with Hurry, for example--and since most of the book doesn't rhyme anyway, why bother to force this?).The best part about it is that it's very short.My kids like it, and yours probably will, too, so long as they are young enough to not be purists about their favorite characters."
1,Not worth the shipping cost,We got two of these machines about 2 years ago. The first one lastest about a year and the second is now taking forever to make 6-8 cups of coffee. Definitely not up to Cuisinart reputation for other appliances.
3,Uncivil Liberties: Italian Americans Under Siege During World War II,"This is one of the few books written on the subject regarding the suspension of Habeas Corpus for Italian Americans during WWII. Seldom have I found a fellow American, or American of Italian extraction who realizes that in WWII, Italian Americans were incarcerated, like Japanese Americans! This book details what occurred and should serve as a warning that it can happen again."
4,Charming dvd...,"A well done animated set of Andersen stories, humorous and well produced. Great for young children. Worth the money."
4,"Ah, The 80's!!","Ullman delivers with this collection of her best known hits of the '80's, pre-comedy. Many of the numbers are reminiscent of '50's and '60's girl groups in the U.S., and there are also plenty of original songs (If you're looking for the theme to HBO's 'Tracy Takes On', it's on this CD). If you liked the sound of the Go-Go's and Bangles, here's another CD you will probably enjoy. Most of the tunes are rockin' upbeat tunes that are fun to hum along with ( or sing, if you're alone :-) ), but that is just my personal preferance. With 16 tracks, you can aford to skip over the few clinkers--whatever your preference."
4,Like the girl groups of the 50s and 60s? You'll love this!,"Purchased for the hit ""They Don't Know About Us"" (remember the great video with Paul McCartney?), this CD surprised me. I thought ""They Don't Know"" was a novelty song by a comedienne, but this woman can really sing. I would characterize this CD as mainly a tribute to the girl groups of yesteryear. Many songs are remakes of familiar tunes; ""Bobby's Girl"", ""Life is a Rock But the Radio Rolled Me"", etc. ""I'm Always Touched by Your Presence Dear"", made popular by Blondie, sounds great. Others are less familiar or written for/by Tracey and she does a fabulous job. If you like the sound and style of those great groups, this is a good buy."
3,Raw and Riveting - Sure to turn your stomach....,"Watching ""Executions,"" one quickly gets the point of this video: Little editing, no effects, and plenty of barbarism. This video shows executions from around the world. None are pretty nor quick.This video is made for those who want to understand how justice is execised around the world. They will quickly be shocked as to the speed and brutality of some styles. Brace yourself, this video is not for the faint hearted."
5,Treasure Island,"To me it's amazing that more readers don't know this book, which is filled with such riches that it's a remarkable bargain. First of all it's filled with good poems. As if that's not enough, it's full of intelligent, no-nonsense, jargon-free, and sensitive appraisals of those poems by fellow poets. The result is a heady combination from which any reader can learn a great deal about the art of poetry, derive endless pleasure from sampling and browsing, and keep handy (bedside, etc.) and/or give to deserving friends. A rare collection, very much worth treasuring."
2,Decidedly UN-erotic!,"While a few of the stories in this compliation have some sensual quality, the vast majority are quite disturbing or rather boring. It is disconcerting to be paging through the book while feeling frisky, only to stumble across a story about about woman who dreams of eating feces! I don't care if it was meant to be ""tongue-in-cheek"", it just plain ruins the mood! And I would estimate that roughly 50% of the book deals with S&M or bondage of some sort.....which gets to be a bit tiring when its not your cup of tea. How about reserving this kind of stuff for the ""Mammoth Book of BDSM"" or the ""Mammoth Book of Poo Eating""???The average Penthouse Forum column is more titillating than this disappointing compendium of drivel."
1,A Real Disappointment,"What can I say, this book was NOT erotic. It was dark and depressing for the most part. Rather than stimulating ones interest, it made me want to become celebate. Definately a waste of time and money!"
3,"Good reference book, for serious mycologists.",A great standard reference for the quagmire of fungal taxonomy. At time's it is so specific that a dictionary is needed to read it! Readers interested in identification of fungi should chose a field guide.
4,Good Edgy Perfume,"This is definitely a perfume you would want to apply lightly. It has a fairly strong scent and to me smells kind of fruity and orangey. I like it if applied lightly, as my wife does. But if you put too much on you probably ought to head straight to the shower to wash it off. It's recommended for daytime - which makes sense. The scent edges toward the strong side, although it is pleasant if one has not doused themelves in it.Even though you appear to save a lot of money with the 3.4 oz size if you compare the volume to the price of the smaller sizes, I prefer the smaller bottle. It will last a long time.Overall a thumbs up, but it is not one of my favorites."
3,"Movies are good very good,can't say the same for the box set","I bouth this for the only reason to get a few Godzilla flims I need to fill in my Godzilla DVD collection. When the box was shown in pictures on the amazon store it showed indvidual cases for each movie in the box set I got is 2 generic DVD cases with four DVDS in each case. The box does have wonderful picture quality but the downfall is the packaging production calue is poor in my eyes, but you do get 7 of the best Godzilla films ever made!!!! My opinion is buy it if you just want to own the films, but is your a collector like myself track down the solo realses for theese seven movies for the better production value of the cases I've seen them for about 6-10 bucks."
1,Godzilla Scam,"I thought this was going to be the full box set they showed in the picture. But, guess what? What you see is not what you get. You get the last picture only, a small compiled version of everything. You don't get all the collector DVD cases as shown, which is what I wanted. They make it look like you're getting the collectors package, but alas it's only a trick. I guess I'll not return it, as I wanted them anyways, but I'm very disappointed as I was looking forward to having an amazing collectors box. Now, I'm stuck with a crappy normal box to stick with the rest of my DVDs. I was looking forward to putting it on display, not now. Maybe another day, when I see the collectors box in person I'll buy it when I know I'm not getting scammed."
4,"So awesome, BUT . . .","This is a great collection, hands down, hence the four stars. I deducted a star only because I was confused as to what ""version"" of the product I was getting. I admit I didn't really read the reviews on the side before ordering, I just figured I was getting what Amazon advertised the product as (the first two pictures presented up top).Turns out what you actually get is an economically packaged set consisting of two DVD cases full of DVDs (yes, all the discs are there) in a standard slipcase as opposed to the two-part box and individually-cased digipacks as advertised. I would suggest that Amazon take the ""out of print"" photos down and keep only the last two customer photos.Other than that I am stoked I finally have all of these movies in the original Japanese/English-Subbed versions together as one set, and for so cheap! You pay for what you get, though. If you're looking for the original OOP version of the boxset you're going to have to pay upwards of $50 or more for it."
1,Underwhelming,"Not my favourite Scholl album, to put it mildly, even though his version of the Habanera is stunningly and wittily sung, and his own composition, White as Lilies, was a huge hit in Korea after being used on a TV car commercial. The songs are good in themselves, and Visse is extraordinary as always, and very funny. Bertin is unmemorable here. As send-ups go, well, I'm sure the boys had fun, but mostly it's lost on me. If there was a fire and I had to lose one of my Scholl CDs, this would be the one. The Orchestre Philharmonique du Carmargue sounds like a synthesiser. (Scholl has one of his own.) Not an essential purchase."
3,Noteworthy!,"Being new to the countertenor voice, I found very refreshing and unique the deliverance of ""Je suis grise"", and ""Una Furtiva Lagrima"". These two arias make the entire CD worth-having, at least for me. The singing affections by Visse in ""Je suis grise"" are stunning and beautiful. Such a voice and technique! I'd heard ""Una Furtiva Lagrima"" in the tenor voice before, but had to hear in the countertenor register to fall in love with the aria."
3,Baby Care Review,"This product is HIGHLY OVERPRICED! I was disappointed in the fact that only six items were addressed for the high price I paid for this product. There was no Q&A or anything outside of the six items covered... again highly disappointed that it is so ""narrow"" in it's information for the price! Once I received it and watched it - I kept asking myself ""is that all of it?"" Would not have purchased it had I known it was so ""limited"" in it's information."
2,Lough and Learn About Baby Care,"This DVD is not worth the money. Maybe for someone who never even held a baby, but if you have any sence of babies it is not worth the money. It is simply too short. And typical stuff is shown. I was hoping to learn from this video on what to do if a baby is crying non stop, or what to do in case the baby gets milk or food stuck in its throat . So I was not really satisfied."
5,I loved it!!,I thought it was great!! Even my dad liked it and he dosen't like many kids books!! I'd recomend it!!
4,A very good book,"Our class just finished this book a few days ago. It is one of the best books I've ever read. The last page of the book is very symbolic and it's hard to understand the intensity of the situation, but over all this is a very good book. The first part of the book is like half of a long, confusing journey. The second part explains part one through flashbacks. In the last part of the book, Julie/Miyax goes through many personality changes and attitude changes."
5,Good book,"This was a good book, not exciting but still good. I could read it over and over again. Good little story line, the wolves are also very cool. Over all a very good book."
2,This was a good book but some was not exciting.,I had to read this book for a school project. I think adults may like this book better. Part one was the best in the book because the wolves were in that part the most but part 2 was horrible and very boring. Part 3 was like most other books. The Unexpected end came and it was over.
4,Julie of the Wolves,"I enjoyed this book because I like how the author keeps the reader thinking about what is going to happen next. However, I did not like the ending. It was hard to concentrate on the book because it was hard to follow the book. I liked the genre and I recommend it to whoever likes the wilderness and adventure, because there is both. The plot was realistic because it took place in the wilderness, and there is a wilderness in this world. I learned that you should not run away if you don't like something, because you could get lost and hurt. If the author made her words more clear, and easier to understand, then I would read another book by her. I did not like how the book leaves you hanging. I was also kind of sad that the leader of the pack died."
3,Julie of the wolves-okay,"Julie of the wolves is a okay book about a girl named Miyax who goes through life changes during periods of times,which has some action in it for those action fans but around the end of the story everything happens to fast like amaroq dies kapu becomes the new leader and julie finds kapugean.there are rare parts of action though it would have been well better suited if there were more though.i would recommend this book to all the people who like action drama and exiting twist combined into a very good/okay book."
4,Julie Of The Wolves,"Miyax a 13 year old girl was with her Alaskan village one day and the next she is stranded in the wilderness with no one to guide her but the north star and a pack of wolves. She must follow the wolves to try and get their attention to her. The north star is still not out in the sky for she is far away from it. Miyax is headed for point hope to find her penpal she has been writing to for almost a year. How will she get there with only a mans knife and a backpack full of food? Is there any danger ahead? Will she find her father? But most of all, will the wolves help her survive? Read Julie Of The Wolves to find out what happens!"
5,Amazing story that values all of humanity!,"I have often showed this movie in some of my classes, and it truly shows the value of respecting all people, regardless of how different they may be from you. Joe Pesci and Brendon Fraser play magnificent roles, and come together to show the real meaning of being an Honors student! All students, young and old, should learn the lessons in this movie! Highly recommended for all to see!"
3,Write this again...in thirty years,"This predictable story attempts to be deep, but never makes it past the shallow end. Pesci's great truths to the youth are simplistic, and presented to the students in uninteresting undramatic ways. The students buy into him...only because the script tells them to. I think even junior college students wouldn't take Pesci or his rantings seriously. It's a nice premise, but the script doesn't have the weight necessary. My guess is that the scripwriter was relatively young, and couldn't be expected to present the great essential truths learned from a life lived, when he himself hasn't made that journey yet. A suggestion: ""The Paper Chase"" with Timothy Bottoms and John Houseman...a much better, satisfying, and involving film about growing wiser while attending Harvard."
4,With Honors,"When this movie first started, I was a little skeptical. But ""With Honors"" turned out to be a touching movie about a young college student who learns a great deal about life. The college student Monty (played by Brendan Fraiser) meets a homeless man Simon (played by Joe Pesci), and although they don't exactly hit it off at first, they eventually gain respect for one another as people and become great friends. Simon ends up teaching Monty a lot about life, most importantly that you should enjoy life while you have the chance. Although a predictable movie, it certainly touched my heart, and pointed out the more important things in life."
3,"what, no baseball bat?","Although I believe that a Joe Pesci movie in which he does not viciously beat someone is bordering sacrelige, WITH HONORS was somewhat commendable. This movie follows a Harvard student (Brenden Fraser) as he loses his thesis and must obey the bidding of a remarkably cultured bum (Joe Pesci) to get it back. Anyone could predict the outcome; the two fall for each other (in a dissapointingly heterosexual way) and-believe it or not-Joe Pesci is revealed to have a critical illness just as the two become close. Though it was a hackneyed plot, this movie delivered a few laughs and also includes a glimpse of Fraser's hot young buns. I would reccomend this movie to anyone who has two hours to spare, and quite frankly, nothing better to do."
4,Good Control,"A very good program to do WYSIWG. However, it lacks the simplicity of Frontpage on the pubilshing feature and other interactive features such as FORM publishing."
2,Could Have Should Have Been Better,"This book was a bit of a disappointment, the text is informative, but the poor black and white images are really quite awful, and not every state capitol comes with an image, which is very odd in a book of this kind..the book feels like a ph.d disertation that was bound into a book, the physical book is quite second rate in quality, though the text is scholarly..could have, should have been better...seriously over priced."
3,Not as good as I hoped,Nice looking and they feel good in my hand but the tips scratch up and round over quickly ... about the same as much lower priced units. Certainly nothing special
2,Changed all batteries twice and still doesn't work!,"I purchased Dora Sparkle & Twirl Mermaid Doll for my granddaughter's 4th birthday, along with the other Dora dolls which go with it. The problem is that the base does not work, will not turn properly and just gets stuck in one position. I changed all 7 batteries, still with no luck and again changed them today when I brought the toy to my granddaughter!! What a waste of money and time, I'm so very disappointed in this Fisher-Price item."
2,Pretty but not very entertaining,"My daughter is a huge Dora fan. I've seen this toy in stores and tested it out. It seemed boring so decided not to buy it. Later, I found it for less than $10 on Amazon. The retail price is from $30-$40. I thought it was a great deal therefore I purchased it. My 2 year old likes the twirling. She does it over and over again. But that's about it. The doll of Dora is removable but stiff and heavy so she doesn't carry her along. She does comb Dora's hair with the comb provided and she wears the barret. Dora also tells a story. I suppose if you buy the other dolls sold seperately, they each tell a different story. I'm not planning on buying any. Overall, it was played with for about a week. But it's been about a month ago and she hasn't touched it again."
3,interesting overview of plague in medieval european society,"I am currently reading a series of books on European Medieval history and I found this book an interesting read. I appreciated especially the multi-dimensional discussion on social, economic and political effects of the plague. The links with modern-day AIDS are thought-provoking. I thought it a pity that the book was also a bit short..."
1,Robert Anderson -- An Idiot-Hypocrite?,"R.A.: What a bleak, anticlimactic, eschatological PR caper that Birthday Letters charade made for.... Ted made his last buck.Does wRAng NOT see the irony?? Just because wRAng has a shortage of idols does not give him the right to dismember Plath's perceived enemies in a super-literary effort that will no doubt prove profitable.If you respect Plath, you will read HER works, not wRAng's distortion of them."
2,did not fit truck,"I entered information for make, model and year of truck, link stated it would fit our truck, but when the item arrived it didn't fit at all, had to return"
1,Tea that isn't tea and that's really hard to drink,"I bought Yogi tea after reading all the good reviews it got on Amazon. Boy, was I disappointed!It's very very hard to drink. I forced it down my throat and it took a lot from meto hold it down. I had the puke sensation for a long time after drinking it. Now I know,why it works for weightloss. After drinking this, you don't feel like eating or drinking anything. I also noticed that this tea has all kinds of (organic) ingredients, onlythat it is missing is Tea! Go figure!So far I've used 3 tea bags, the rest is going to my trash bin. What a waste of money."
2,Poor quality,"I bought 4 of these for my family. Within the first two days the first one broke. One of the joysticks broke during calm, regular play. Within 3 weeks, another one of the controllers just stopped working, haven't been able to figure out why. Overall, these are just poor quality. They do look cool all lit up though."
1,xbox wireless iglow controller green,my son received this as a christams gift and despite several battery changes it did not work....... needless to say he was v-e-r-y disappointed. directions for returning to amazon stated that only unopened items could be returned. not sure how you can find out that something does not work until it is opened.will not purchase anything electronic from amazon again. i will purchase at a local store even if it is more expensive.
5,Extraordinarily fascinating and compelling reading,"Knowledgeably written by Christopher S. Mackay, an accomplished associate professor of history who has published numerous articles on all periods of Roman history, Ancient Rome: A Military And Political History is a comprehensive political history ancient Rome from the city's origins during the Italian Iron Age to the deposition of its last emperor in A.D. 476. From Rome's growth and conquest to pressures and invasion that eventually destroyed its empire, to how it came to adopt Christianity as its state religion and the lasting influence of that legacy, Ancient Rome is extraordinarily fascinating and compelling reading. Written in terms as engaging to the lay reader as the professional historian, Ancient Rome is a dynasty-by-dynasty account that spreads out what history tells of feuds, assassinations, war, enforced peace, and military transformations in the legendary Roman Empire."
1,"Eye Shutting, Dull, & Asymptotic","I found Devin, by pen named Erin Yorke very dull and boring. I found that a book of romance calibar should be passionate and compelling and would make you keep reading on. This book, however, was the total opposite of that. I wasn't that I couldn't interpret Ms. Yorke's writing or her style, but I found that I couln't picture the character being portrayed, nor the scheme of it. I found that the book was lacking the ""romance"" and ""love triangles"" that a book of this type should have. By the time I finished the book, I couldn't see the plot, nor everything else I had read. Not to impune Ms. Yorke's writing styles, but I think the book was overall boring, dull, eye closing, and would make you say and think, ""Asympotic! "" about 29 times in my head, still with my eyes closed!"
4,Amazing portrayal,Gerald McRaney who is most known for his tough but basically good guy roles on TV plays the part of a real life serial killer who went on a murder spree across the US back in the 80s. Along the way he picks up a teenager who is not like his previous victims because she is tough and doesn't cave in to his bullying.At first the police aren't sure if she is an working with him or just a kidnap victim. Eventually he lets her go shortly before being killed by police as he is moving north to try and enter Canada.The really chilling part of this whole movie is just how convincingly McRaney portrays this sociopathic murderer. It is so different from his other roles it is very impressive how well he handles it.
4,Good Value,"It works good as far and light and effects, but i agree that the music needs to be really loud for the mic to pick it up. Also the unit creates a TON of heat, (hot enough not to be able to touch i with bare hands) It probably works better than an electric heater in that department, so i just have a little fan near it just in case. But over all for the price...it's well worth it and the effects are very nice."
2,OK if you can sew.,"Bought this for a Christmas gift. I doesn't have nearly enough stuffing in it, the neck bends and droops. The head was deformed and the back lacked detail. I was able to fix most with some simpple stitching, but unchanged the product is very disappointing."
3,Generally boring,Rail workers try to cope with both professional and personal problems.Some intimacy highlights necessity to build better dwellings while sharing a rented place with a single co-worker.Generally boring.
3,The evolution of a minority,"Concise and simple, yet penetrating enough to explain Humanistic Judaism. Provides a helpful discussion of the historical roots of the change in Judaism and the roles of Napoleon and of the establishment of the USA in changing the historical status of Jewish people as a minority. Most interesting is the impact of of anti-Semitism on the religion. The last 3 pages are very useful regarding the understanding of the change in the Jewish identity. The book stands against the common wisdom of most of the Jewish writers who stresse demise of the Jewish identity to assert that the current situation and events will only carry a better future for the Jews. Jews today are freer than any other time in their history."
5,Love this Sling!,"I recently purchased this and love it. I prefer to carry my baby around with me and this makes it so much easier. There are other great slings out there too, but my main problem with many of the other slings is their look. I really like how cute and modern HotSlings are. I'll be saving up to buy another one soon! Definitely recommend it. Oh, and I used their website to find out my size and I think they do a great job of helping you get the right size."
4,Top-flight writing and acting,"I had owned this film in the VHS version, and it wasn't easy finding the DVD version but finally was able to get it via Amazon.If you have any interest in the New York literary society of the 1920s; in the writers Dorothy Parker, Charles McArthur, Robert Benchley,Alexander Woolcott, etc; or if you just enjoy watching great acting, you should not be disappointed with this film. Even Harpo Marx (as a character) makes a brief appearance."
5,Hard to find in stores now!,I use about 150 pictures at our annual company picnic. This is one of the biggest hits of the picnic. Take the instant film combined with someone who is great with coaxing people to get in the mood for a fun shot and you have a wonderful gift to give a family. you must get film on line and this film was very fresh! Works best out of direct sun for outside shots and in good lighting indoors. Enjoy!
3,Looking for a career change?,"This book was a helpful reference and gave some helpful tips and examples of resumes and cover letters but seemed to be directed more towards individuals looking for a career change or those already working within the industry. However, if you're just out of school as an entry-level applicant your focus with putting together a resume and portfolio is already in practice. The manual could've had more helpful sections for entry-level."
1,"Scholarly -- yes; interesting, no!","This book was VERY difficult to read. Granted it may well be a 'scholarly' document and historians may find it of great value. But, I am not a historian. If you are looking for a 'general' easy read history of the country I'd buy something else. I had planned to spend two weeks in Skopje doing charity work and wanted a basic history of the country. I never got passed the second chapter!"
1,How can these be worn?,"good points: quick delivery, they were screwback (as promised), easy returnbad points: the underside of the ladybugs (the part that sits against the ear)were sharp, the earring posts were very short. Unless intended for a newborn with very thin ear lobes, I don't see how they can be worn."
4,Very nice earrings,"I bought these earrings for my 2-years old daughter. They perfectly fit a young girl and very secure. The look very realistic and natural and resemble a real ladybug sitting on the girl's ear. Someone mught thing they are tiny but it is a size of the ladybug, so don't expect a butterfly size. They look very beautiful especially on sunshine. I like it very much. So does my girl."
4,Not the same cover...,"I really enjoyed reading this story. It had a really interesting view on fate and trying to change your's. The only thing I was disappointed about is that the cover isn't the same. My cover is green and has a person's face with a bandage over it's eyes in the background. The pages and everything, however, still correspond."
2,Broken Plastic Tab Renders It Ineffective,"The little tab broke off of the light. Now it is useless without an improvised ""fix"", which I haven't been able to figure out yet. Unfortunately, I think the best answer is to search for a new front light. I do not recall how the tab broke off. I only remember hitting a street bump/pothole and the light flew off, never to snap into place again. The light was satisfactory and reliable before then. I used it for almost two years before the tab broke. I think the invention to fasten the light's base to the handlebars/ frame is great."
4,Good light in a small package,"Pros:small lightregular batteries (AA)removable lighteasy to install mountflashing mode, good for being seen on the bikeCons:could be a little brighter in non-blinking mode. I think I was expecting just a bit more light from 3 LEDs, but it gets the job done."
2,Not What I Hoped For,"This light works perfectly well under fading light conditions or at any time you want oncoming traffic to see you. The mistake I made was assuming that it projected sufficient light to enable me to see a reasonable distance ahead in total darkness. The LED light is certainly bright enough, particularly in flashing mode, for others to see you but does not extend much beyond two or three feet.If you're looking for an affordable and functional bike light to be noticed, then this one fits the bill. If you want a light that lights up the night, go with something with at least 250 lumens or more."
4,waynes world,"Waynes WorldThe book review of Frank Fortuanos ""Wayne Gretzky: star centerFrank Fortuanos ""Wayne Gretzky star center is a marvelous book full of facts and career statistics of Wayne Gretzky. He tells a great story of his upbringing and even why he tucks his jersey in one side. But, the book does slow down. When he gets into a career it is repetitive to some degree. In each chapter he tells how many points he had in that season, and how hard he worked to win the Stanley cup. But it gives a great story of his life. I highly recommend it to anyone who is doing a report on him"
2,I'm trying to like this,"I love Tim Buckley, but I just don't get this album so far. It sounds like background music for a porn film, only it's played by really good musicians. I understand the era was different, but I haven't been able to find a way to groove on this album yet. I haven't given up, and, if I discover why people love this album so much, I may have to change this review."
5,Personal opinion,The three Discs that I ordered were great and the service was great also I will continue buying from Amazon they have always sent me quality products thank very much Al Vann
4,It is an overall very useful and interesting book on wicca,"This is book is targeted to the wicca beginner and in that sense is very helpful. Although, I didn't really agree with what the beginning implied about religion and how it seemed like you had to be solitary or in a coven. However, as I read through the rest...I thought it too be really an awesome book as far as concise summary of different rituals, spells, gods, symbols and witchy holidays."
2,Happy at first,I loved this blacklight. I was using in for my glow in the dark Zumba class. I was only using it once a month for the one hour class. After the 7th month the light just stopped working. I was lucky it's still covered under warranty and the customer service agent I have been dealing with has been very helpful. HOWEVER the new unit they sent me and the bulbs are defective and broken. The warranty almost is useless if I keep receiving faulty merchandise. It is a very powerful light though and if it lasted more than the 7 hours I used it I would of been satisfied.
5,We love Veggie Tales,My kids love these DVDs. Very Silly Songs is especially great because it shows the words at the bottom. We have enjoyed these songs for many years.
3,Not as good as expected,"Having read Paul Benzaquin's book previously, Esposito's account was disappointing. Too bad Benzaquin's 1959 book is so hard to find....its a much more thorough presentation of this tragic part of Boston history."
1,Save your money!,"Mag wouldn't fit in it's slot and allow the belt to feed through. Thin cheap leather, poor quality product. Slot made for very narrow belt."
4,Decorate however you like,"This is a terrific gift idea. The most important thing to know is you can remove the picture grids shown in the Amazon photo. That way, you can decorate or display the tray however you want. It is a great gift for so many occasions. Nice, sleek espresso finish as well. The reason I only gave it four stars is because there was a tiny chip in mine. I didn't have enough time to return it for a new one and touched it up with a furniture repair marker. Otherwise, a great product."
2,Boom!,"This book is so out of touch with reality it is wacky!!If we can believe the author, Osama bin Laden has so many a-bombs he doesn't know what to do with them.In my view, if Osama does have a nuke, please use it on theauthor...he deserves it."
4,chilling,"If half the accusations made in this book turn out to be true,the Bush administration is far from winning its war on Terrorism."
3,Ted's Best? Yes. Good? Not So Fast.....,"Yes, this is neck and neck with Tooth, Fang, and Claw (1974) as Mr. Nugent's finest hour. However, the ""songs"" are weak and Ted's poor choice of riffs/notes diminish the awesome work of his rhythm section. Someone should release these on 1 disc (they would both fit; thank God for the days when LP's were about 35-40 minutes long instead of the long-winded CD's we get today) and let Ted's fans hear some good stuff instead of the cringeworthy CatScratch/WangoTango stuff......"
1,CLASSIC HAWKS'S SCREWBALL IN A BEAUTIFUL NEW TRANSFER,"Howard Hawk's ""I Was A Male War Bride"" has become a benchmark in screwball comedy. Grant plays a French officer stationed in post-war Germany, who falls for stubborn American WAC officer, Ann Sheridan. This is one of those great comedy of errors, in which two people, destined to be together by the final fade out, have to go through the rarest of hoops to acheive their blissful conclusion.TRANSFER: In a word - gorgeous! A stunning black and white picture with an exceptionally balanced gray scale. Near pristine film elements - perfect contrast levels, solid blacks and NO DIGITAL ANOMALIES, result in a smooth visual presentation that can't be beat. The audio is mono but well balanced.EXTRAS: NONE! Oh well, nobody's perfect!BOTTOM LINE: An absolute must for collectors."
1,not worth the money and time,"This is the book we use in class for the ccna course. It was a waste of money. The more I read the book the more I went crazy. The example and question ask are totally different. I ask the instructor, he still couldn't tell me why the answer in back of the book were right. Don't get the lab book. It doesn't show you enough information to answer the questions. All terms are written in a way that you must be a computer nerd to understand. If wanted a refund from the school books store but they don't allow refunds."
5,A light in a time of crisis,"At a time when all of the news is so grim, it is a great escape to be able to read such an uplifting book. The anecdotes remind us of who we once were and who we can once again become. Thank you Mr. Noah for a wonderful read for these precarious times. The Jouney to Greatness has been a light at the end of a long tunnel!"
3,The designs are over the top,I have subscribed for a year and found some of the design are too artistic which is hard to translate for everyday design.The designs tend to go very achitectural. They are beautiful but I wish they can come a bit closer to a everyday level. It is a good source to get top edgy trends but cannot rely on it to get ideas that you can use tomorrow.
1,Not the sword pictured,"I ordered this rapier because it doesn't look anything like the standard Musketeer rapier. What did they send me? The standard Musketeer rapier:Trademark 00-7X53 Musketeer Rapier Sword - 44 inches - scabbard includedWhat can I say? The scabbard is nice? However, it's not what I ordered and now I get to go through the hastle of trying to return it."
3,I returned this item...,"I purchased this grinder for the purpose of fractionating hard supplements, as in vitamin supplements. For whatever reason, I wasn't happy with the result and returned it. I suppose it might be good at what it's designed for, grinding coffee."
4,"Very capable, but...","I started using HP calculators in college with a 15C (which admirably survived a mauling by a beagle puppy) that I still use today. When I started with my first employer, the calculator of choice was the 41CX as many programs had been written in house for our specific tasks (This was when a 12MHz 286 was a HOT machine!) I bought my 48GX at a going-out-of-business sale for ($). I could hardly pass that up. Now that I've used it for about a year, I have found that it is quite capable, but the programming is tougher than on the 41 series. One negative comapred the 41 family is quick access to memories. When doing a long series of calculations that have a lot of intermediate results, it's a bit harder on the 48.Having said that, even at the price here, it is good value for money."
1,What are you basing price on,"I dont know where you got the base price, actual base price should be about half that. I have no connection with HP and am not a salesman for them I just want information to be accurate. someone will believe that is a reasonable price and be taken advantage of. you can check MY sources at the HP website I dont see anyway to check sellers resource. oh, on reviewing guidelines I see reviewing price is a no-no. since this will probably only be seen by the reviewer, please let someone know that this customers confidence in amazon has just been severely undermined."
5,A lovely evening read with my little boy,"I like this book as soon as I opened it. Fresh illustration and funny story. It comes from author with a kid's heart and not tainted by the ""grown-up"" boring world. I also like this book because there is not right or wrong judgement in the book. Kids should not simply judging things on a few rules. That will not give them the opportunity to feel and think about the things. Thank you author."
5,The Walls Have Ears,"Perish the thought that any of us should lose our faculties and not be able to communicate when we desperately need to. It is always good reading when a novelist can get you to think inside someone else's head and to ponder how you would react in her circumstances.Ms. Carlon is a gifted mystery writer along the lines of Peter Lovesey.This novel is not lily-white, yet it does stop short of some of the more blatant evil that has crept into some of Carlon's other books.The Whispering Wall is well-crafted without being too dark, and it is a good selection to start with if you would like to give this Australian author a try."
2,Poor VHS Quality Ruined This One,"I purchased this movie because I'm a Bolo Yeung fan - imagine my disapointment when the tape wouldn't focus, causing me to spend the entire time wrestling w/my control to get a picture that didn't roll. Also, since the movie was filmed in wide-screen, but the video captured only the center portion of the screen, I was unable to see faces in close-ups, or tell who was speaking - very frustrating, to say the least.The dubbing was poorly done - I'd much rather have closed-captioning and hear the actors real voices than to hear rediculous accents come out of their mouths! You're likely to hear anything from cockney to hillbilly - come on!!The only saving grace in this hard-to-follow storyline, caused at least partly I'm sure by the above problems, was Bolo's fight scene w/ Brandon Lee. Next time, I'm going w/DVD...take my advice and do the same..."
1,Confused,I was under the impression this book was about different sex tips almost like a manual. Not the case I love Zane and I understand where she was going with answering letters to fans about different issues they face in their sex life. Overall it was a easy read . In my opinion it took way..... Too long to arrive. Over two weeks to be exact.
2,Not impressed,"DOn't waste your money, get is at half priced books. This book is a summary of her fans writing letters in to her not. It was not very entertaining to me."
3,IT WAS PRETTY GOOD,"I WISH THAT ZANE COULD HAVE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE SUBJECTS A LITTLE MORE IN DEPTH, OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS A GREAT BOOK."
4,Great quality,I would have preferred something a little heftier but the quality is excellent and the blade cuts very well. It's now my #2 knife after the 8-inch Victorinox chef's knife.
2,"NOT SO GOOD, BUY THE CHEF KNIFE INSTEAD","*****UPDATED REVIEW:I have had this knife for a long time now, it is no longer sharp, and is junk. I also have the 8"" CHEF'S KNIFE, bought at the same time, it is EXCELLENT, choose that over the Santoku.previous review: I am loving this knife, it is so sharp, cuts onions with out causing tears, great for chopping. I have several Wustof knives that I can not keep sharp, so after reading a review from America's Test Kitchen and the great reviews on here, I decide this knife was worth trying for under $30. I am so happy I did. It really slices and dices like a charm. It is lighter than my pricey knives, but it doesn't bother me. The handle is easy to hold on to, and fits nicely in my hand.I have only had it for a couple weeks, so I will be interested to see how sharp it remains, but I figure for the price I can buy a new one every couple years if necessary.I have no complaints, it was money well spent on this knife!"
3,underwhelmed,"This is a good knife, but definitely not worth 26 bucks. It looses its sharpness almost immediately and the air pockets on the sides are not deep enough for it to work. I would probably by this knife at the 9 dollar price point."
4,"Great blade, handle is comfortable but lightweight","I have to agree with most of the reviews that this is a great knife for the price. It takes a little getting used to the lightweight handle, though. I do still like some of my more substantial knives better. I also bought the paring knife from this line, and it's just phenomenal! The handle is much less of an issue for me with the smaller knife, and at the price it's a steal."
5,Very Good buy,"One thing that helped me decide to buy the Victorinox, was there are a number of professional reviews that rate it a best buy. It is sharp, durable and reasonably priced. It is a good buy, I highly recommend."
2,Not as good as recommended,"This product although recommended by Cooks was disappointing. It cuts just fine, but it doesn't feel balanced in my hand--it feels cheap."
5,Perfect for the Veggie Butcher,"I really love using my Victorinox Swiss Army 7-Inch Santoku knife. I cut a lot of vegetables as a home cook, and this is my go-to knife for that.I also own a Victorinox Fibrox 8-Inch Chef's Knife, and thought that was the bomb, but this Santoku knife is even better because it's so sharp and made to cut veggies easily.This is an awe inspiring knife. I'd definitely buy it again."
5,My favorite knife,"I use this all the time, i WAS SO IMPRESSED witht the quality I ordered another one. You can't buy a better knife for the money."
1,WARNING,"If you are a fan of Avalon Hill's Squad Leader DON'T buy this game. It has nothing at all in common with the board game. I bought this game and even before the end of the tutorial, uninstalled it and threw it in the bin. Thanks for nothing Hasbro/Microprose."
2,"German Soldier screaming ""MOMMY"" when shot.","For all you reviewers who thought the Germans were screaming ""mommy"" whenshot: They were not; they were shouting ""Sani!"", which is short for""Sanitaeter"" or ""Medic"", (in English). Incidently, though, my Dad servedin the german army in Russia and he recalled many soldiers who, uponbeing hit shouted ""O Mutti!""(Oh Mommy!-ENGLISH)!So, it DID in fact happen ... and not only in the german army.So much for that. All in all I did not like the game because of the numerous crash bugs, graphic problems and the Oh so slow movement ofthe soldiers. So I generally agree with the majority of most of thereviews."
2,Movie is much better,"This book is just like the movie ~~ almost word for word ~~ so if you've seen the movie, don't buy this book. If you haven't seen the movie, buy the book ~~ then see the movie, you won't be disappointed.It's a fast read ~~ perfect for a lazy sunny afternoon at the pool ~~ it doesn't go into depth about anything and it reads ""like the movie"" ~~ so you have a mental image of the characters gliding along in the book.If you're looking for a meaty in-depth look of the characters and of the times, this is not the book to read. If you just want to recapture the memory of the movie ~~ this is the perfect book for that!6/1/04"
3,Skip It If You've Seen The Movie,"All I can really say is that if you have seen this movie, do not read the book. I noticed on the cover of the book that it was based on the movie but I didn't think it would be verbatim. I am a big fan of the movie and could watch it over and over and so I found myself picturing each character and how they speak. That being said, if you've never seen the movie go ahead and read the book but then rent the movie. You'll love it!!"
2,A disappointment~,"This book was a huge disappointment. I saw the movie first and thought it would be a better book. When I saw the book in the store, I was excited and bought it right away. It turns out, however, that the BOOK is based on the MOVIE and, boy, can you tell. It was like the author was handed the script and just filled in the non-dialoge parts around the dialoge. There were a few parts in the book that somewhat clarified parts of the movie and I did like the ending, which went a step further than the movie did. All in all, though, if you are seeing the movie skip the book. It's not worth it. On the other hand, you might enjoy the book on it's own. It's an easy read and would be nice for a cold winter's night when you don't have anything better to do."
2,size runs small and the heels are a little too bulky,"I always wear 6 1/2, but this pair of 6 1/2 is way too small. The back of my heels was standing on nothing. It has to go back.The high wedge heels look a little too bulky, so it would not look good with skirts, shorts, or capris. But it could look good with pants that cover most of the heels."
1,tore the minute I pulled it up over my calf,I purchased for special party and I was gently pulling the stocking up over my calf and a run appeared. I had to wear tights instead. Flimsy material dont buy.
5,War Novel Holds Shocking Truth,"After reading ""Every Effort"" as a requirement for a high school class, I was surprised on how the story affected my emotions. I immediatley felt the pain that Barbara and her family had experienced. This book depicts the raw truth of how a family suffers when a loved one is sent to war. Barbara Mullen was an extremely strong woman who supported her two small children during a time in her life where her future held too many unknown answers. This book not only held the truth, but it also demonstrated how a strong person can move on after a devastating experience. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested not only in the Vietnam War, but also in the experiences that unravel in the families of soldiers."
2,Disappointing.,"Nymphetamine is not one of CoF's best albums by far. When I got this, I had high hopes for it; ""Damnation"" was a disappointment to me, and I had heard so many good things about this album. So I picked it up, hoping it would be more along the lines of ""Dusk & Her Embrace"" maybe even ""Cruelty"". Needless to say, it wasn't.Cradle has become a ""mall-goth"" band. I never would've seen it coming, considering that I love ""Dusk"" and ""The Principal of Evil Made Flesh"" so much. I suggest buying either of those two, not Nymphetamine, if you want to hear the ""good"" CoF."
1,Horrifiying,Cradle of fiflth's members are posers and horrifing beyond all belief if you see a picture of them i swear youll laugh your head off there music is nowhere near black metal and they need to stop making music or whatever.......:) :( :)
5,Amazingly good and haunting,Im a huge cradle of filth fan and when i saw their new c.d. i immediatly got it. At first I was nervous it was gonna suck since they took away the orchestra but i was wrong....its so good. If you like any of their albums get this one.
3,Familiar feeling,"The newest release from CoF feels like older, original Euro-gothic work, with a nod to female vocals and chants. The lyrics- as usual- are well sculpted and interact well with the music's flow from high and low pitches, speed, and intensity. To me, this album reminds me of Old Man's Child and Theater of Tragedy, only with Danny's vocals. The band needs to remain more consistent: Cruelty and the Beast remains my favorite for its synergy and cohesive talent, especially on keyboard. Of their recent releases, this is my least favorite CoF album because it appears like the record was thrown together too fast: see my comments about band members' longevity with CoF, as well as listen to a more metalic sytle. I compare it to Metallica's album, St. Anger: Good, a little different, but not the best representation of the band."
1,Horrifying...,"It's releases like this that makes me question the American record buying public. Do Cradle of Filth STILL have a US record deal? Has anyone grown tired of this pompous trash? Nope. Cradle of Filth keep releasing a continually watered down version of their previous record again and again and the public still come out in enough droves that they can do it in the public eye. Where the fans of this gothic trash-opera sprout from I'll never know. The guitars are flaccid, the vocals hideous and the keyboards just downright silly. No need to discuss the art of composition in terms of these boys because it's simply too sloppy to note.Skip it...unless you're a glutton for punishment."
3,Not up to their old standards.,"This cd follows the usual Cradle formula.1. Intro2. Heavy/catchy song3. Long technical songInstrumental just past the middleLong aggresive song at the end.This formula has worked very well for Cradle on their past albums, but just seems to be played out here. His vocals are still perfect live, but for some reason on this cd they dont pack the same punch that they used to. They lyrics are more simple, and the new guitarist has to include a quick one string riff into every song. This is their weakest cd yet, and is too poppy for fans of their old work.Still, if you like cradle then you can wade through the sludge on this cd to find something useful. But I would just download it, it isn't worth buying."
3,Not Cradle's best,"This is far from the best record the CoF has put out. Although it has some nice tracks, it seems as if they did not put their hearts into this one.This isn't an album i could really get into and sit and listen to the entire thing. Dani also really didn't seem to try to hard with this one.This is much more of a goth record than a black metal record, which CoF has always been.I would say check out Damnation and a Day or From the Cradle to Enslave instead of Nymphetamine."
1,Todd-Ranked #1 in World's Stupidest Person Contest,You want to know how stupid Todd is? He bought this very stupid cd that i'm supposed to be writing about and he doesn't even like it. Now what kind of person buys cd's that they don't even like. BECAUSE HE'S STUPID
3,I've seen better Star Wars novels,"While I enjoy the continuing story of Luke's for-now love of his life Callista, I'm a bit turned off by all the talk of ""but we're Jedi, we can take a few Imperials"". Also somewhat of a turnoff is the apparent timidity of most of the Jedi on Yavin when faced with the prospect of actually having to use their Jedi powers in action instead of just training. It seems kind of cowardly to me."
1,Stamp out one-armed wampas in your lifetime,"*Darksaber* really makes one question whether Kevin J. Anderson should have been given the SW universe at all. His ridiculous and implausible usage of plot devices such as the one in the subject line, his tedious repetition of the exact same descriptions every three pages or so (a tribute to his infamous ""write-by-dictation"" method) and his complete massacre of the character Callista stand out as the trio of low points in what is unarguably the worst single post-ROTJ SW novel outside of *Cyrstal Star.*"
3,Okay; certianly nothing to set the world on fire...,"Darksaber was an alright book, but if you plan to buy it, be prepared for a bad ending. Anderson did better on this book than he did on the Jedi Acadamy Trilogy, but he tended to abuse the characters a lot. It had a plot that was not interesting enough to implant itself in my memory; after only a few months I have forgotten all but the most important parts of the story. If you do decide to buy Darksaber, remember, it's not the only Star Wars book out there."
4,"Great, could have been better","Nice twist of plots. Good way to mix the resurgent Imperials, Callista's conflict with her disability from using the Force, and Durga the Hutt's attempt to conquer the galaxy. But honestly, what's with ANOTHER galaxy threatening superweapon? Come on. And...oh no! It's the one-armed ice wampa from THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK! Please. You'd think we were seven years old. From a Star Wars fan's point of view, this was an enjoyable read, and would recommend it to all Star Wars fans."
3,An okay Star Wars book.,"Darksaber. It sounds ominous and it should. The hutts have found the plans for the orignal death star and are creating their own. As Leia and Han rush around to stop this new threat, a new batch of Jedi have graduated from the acadamy and go off looking for work. And on top of that, Admiral Daala has banded all of the Imperials together into one main force. Luke and his new love, Callista are looking for ways to restore Callista's powers.Daala uses revenge against the New Republic and sends a massive strike force against the Jedi. The hutt weapon is sabotoged and eliminated.Overall, the book was pretty unrealistic. The jedi defeat about 100 star destroyers by throuwing them out of the system and the hutt weapon never fires a shot. By the end, the entire Imperial force is all but ruined and Callista vanishes.An okay read, but not the best."
1,Well...,"Okay, the whole death Star thing is getting just a LITTLE old, don't you think? What was up with the whole callista/Mara conversation, Anderson? He could have done much better. Poor Luke, GIVE HIM A COMPANION! he deserves it! I never really liked Callista's character, now I REALLY don't like her!"
3,A GOOD BOOK BUT GREAT CONSIDERING THIS IS STAR WARS,This book is a good and somtimes exciting novel but to be honest I recommend that you spend money on another STAR WARS book such as: REBEL DAWN THE NEW REBELLION JEDI SEARCH CHAMPIONS OF THE FORCE The plot goes that the hutts are constructing a super weapon which is actually the death star but without the station its just the laser.And the rebellion know little about this but suspect somthing about Durga the hutt and the rebellion also have to worry about UNDEAD admiral Daala (after being prsumed dead)who has gatherd a very large fleet of star destroyers to crush the jedi accedamy on Yavin 4.Really the only bit about the book that sparks it up is the great idea Daala has to crush the rebellion.I dont want to spoil the book for u but DONT buy this book but DO loan it if possible.Thats all from meChris morgan Surrey England
5,Anderson is amazing!,"Anderson has woven an extraordinary tale. I absolutely love the style of Anderson's writing, a mix of action, adventure, romance, drama, and even a little humor! This fantastic story is one I'd read forever, and never tiring of it! And I was full of emotions when Callista..... well, I'm not telling you that! This is a fantastic book. It's a classic."
2,Not another super weapon!,"This book had it's moments but overall was not what I have come to expect from a Star Wars novel. It was cool with that old Imperial scientist but was a little far fetched when he was executed more than once. Another death star. Come on, can't you think of your own ideas? It would have been better if the death star, that dominated most of the book, would fire at least once! The space battle at the end was sort of unrealistic. At least he tried, we should thank him for that. His trilogy Jedi Academy was much better. I would rent this book from the library if you want to read it, otherwise, I would stay away and read a book worthy of your time!"
5,Start Reading!!!!,"Kevin Anderson writes yet another book in the wonderful world of Star Wars! In Darksaber all the familliar heroes are there-with some new heroes as well. The Empire, lead by Admiral Daala, and the Hutts rear their ugly heads at the same time- and it is up to Luke and the rest of the gang to stop them! The best Star Wars book yet"
3,It's okay but K.J.A did a better job with the trilogy!!,What went wrong I don't know but how could he leave Chewbacca out of the action. Did he go on vacation during the middle of the book.What happen to the characters personalities.What's up with Han diing straigh into ties.Whan will tht pathetic Admiral Daala die or be put to scrubbing the ship deck. She lost a Super Star Destroyer that caused pratically no damage.However this book did have some good points lots of sction and you get to read about the Jedi Knights in action. You also find out a cool method the Emperor used to punish those who fail. And some info on Hutts
3,Doesn't live up to rumours,"All my pals raved about Darksaber. Fantastic! they said. I expected Durga to, well, know what he's doing. That aside, Daala and Callista must both die!!! How many times will they live when they're supposed to die? Oh yeah, and the superweapon is a bit old by now."
1,Common sense,"When buying a book, you would hardly expect to get only a pieceof common sense for your money. Unfortunately, this is the case with thisbook. Its main message is ""get yourself a skiing instructor and learn how to ski"". I agree, noone learns how to ski (swim, play basketball, etc.) from a book only, but nonetheless the book should advise on techniques, not tell one that he/she needs a coach. It's pretty obvious, even for a dummy."
2,"A pleasant, but overly long quest.","This, most ""modern"" installment yet in the world of _Illusion_, combines Victorian technology with deadly magic; WWII-style brutality, Verne-like travel, intrigue and romance. In an alternate world strongly resembling ours, a brutal and efficient empire is conquering the world, while the rest of civilization is frittering away time. A young woman undertakes a perilous race to win a chance at a magical weapon that can change the balance of power.The mixture of romance, skulduggery, adventure and magic is entertaining, but overly long. Despite well-drawn characters, the quest contains too many subplots to maintain tension, and the result is less effective than in Volsky's earlier, simpler novels like _The White Tribunal_.The novel takes place decades or centuries later than many of Volsky's books, and has references to places, phenomena, and even titles of her previous works."
2,"I was expecting another ""Illusion"". Was fooled.","Paula Volsky is an amazing novelist. Go Read ""Illusion.""The main charachter is an annoying straw feminist, who somehow got ""modern"" ideas of gender relations, that make no sense for her to have. She makes no effort to reconcile her views with society, or adjust her ideas to reality. The book says She has traveled before, but judging by how she acts in-story, I find that hard to believe. She behaves so stupidly, it is unreal.I can handle a dumb main charachter though, If other charachters are interesting enough. Unfortunately, the interesting charachters all get pushed to the sidelines (th hilarious twins), or we only get to see their boring sides (like the young ""german"" general, who we always see pining inexplicably after The main girl, and briefly angsting about his past.)"
3,A bit pricey for 1 pair of socks.,"The picture shows 4 diff colors of socks, so I assumed that I was buying 4 pair. I was quite surprised to get just 1 pair. The quality seems ok, but I think the vendor needs to clearly indicate that's the price is for 1 pair only."
2,Weak battery good signal though,"Not too happy with these phones. The sound quality is fine, but they have the worst battery life of any phone I've used in a long time. I think they included very weak batteries with low capacity. Another issue is that the base station's charging socket isn't too good. Sometimes the phone fits in there and doesn't make proper contact so you aren't even charging the phone! Also if you leave the phones in the charging station for too long they get extremely hot. This probably caused the batteries to die prematurely. That's cheap electronics, it should have a smart charger that stops charging when the batteries are full."
3,Easy to brew but lacking depth.,"This is a very good product but you really have to use at least two bags to get the same robust flavor as home brewed Chai tea. It seems to lack depth, but it certainly is convenient!"
1,Single Disc - No Special Features,"This is lame, it just a single disc version of the movie with a couple of audio commentaries and none of the special features which are on the current ""Deluxe Edition"". Oh yeah, it comes with the widescreen and fullscreen version. As if that's anything to rave about.Other than that, this is an awesome movie that's very funny, has great action, special effects, and story. Overall one of Will Smith's best movies."
4,Great movie that deserves 4 1/2 stars but too much comedy,"This is a really great movie, and on my system it would receive 4 1/2 stars. The only reason it wasn't excellent and flawless was that I expected more science fiction after seeing ""Independence Day"", also starring Will Smith with Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman. But it was a good comedy, and both Smith and Tommy Lee Jones should be commended for their great acting in the film. I do like ""Independence Day"" better, however, but ""Men in Black"" is still a must-see."
5,Fantastic,Great movie.This has always been one of my all tine favorite movies. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are a great team.
3,"I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD,","the movie was kind of funny,the actors were really good,they tried really hard to make this movie as funny as possible.rent it,or buy it,you wont regret it,,,,J.C.N.J. ."
2,Somewhat redeeming,"Men In Black, to me, was a movie that didn't exactly deserve to earn 250 million dollars, but then again also deserved to earn that much. It has some bright moments: Great special effects, good acting. And some bad moments: Not very funny, typical and predictable ending. Still, if you are a fan of science fiction films that don't take themselves seriously, then by all means, watch Men in Black."
2,Not sure...,"Ok the story as an absolute story is not bad, actually it's somehow interesting. The animation is perfect and well done too. I think this is the best film ever for Will Smith! Oh yes, and you may accept this movie as a light commedy.One of the main downfalls of this movie was that the Science Fiction side of the film was badly affected when the story got framed into commedy! In other words, the suspense was dead!Some of you are comparing this movie with Star Wars or Aliens... I think this is not right! Nor Star Wars or Aliens was a commedy! Instead the suspense was very genuine and the movie turned out to be very powerful Science Fictions!Anyway, this movie maybe worth seeing once or twice... but I do not recommend buying it unless you are a big fan of Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones!"
4,"A realistic, gripping plot masterfully told","Powell winds current and past real-world events into a fictional tale of international terrorism that gets hold of the reader early and never lets go. He ties together so many actual events and historical facts that, when finished, the reader begins following the national and world news closer than ever before just to make sure the story is not really happening! One negative: the tie to Nostradamus' prophecies could have been stronger. I recommend this book to any reader who enjoys Clancy, Dale Brown, or even Cussler."
1,A total repeat of the first movie Mighty Ducks. STUPID!!!,It was STUPID!!! The whole plot of the story was just like the The first movie in other wordsit stunck|!!!! STUPID!!!
5,D2 mighty ducks,"I received the movie promptly, and it was in fantastic condition and at a great ptrice."
4,Pretty nice little table,"The table came pretty quickly, but one of the pieces was drilled wrong. The counter-sink holes were on the wrong side. I emailed the company, and they were very helpful in sending out a new replacement part. The main complaint I have is that it took over a week and a half for them to get the new item shipping. The part came in, I was able to get the table built, and overall is a nice little table. I love the design, and besides the shipping delay which is the only reason this didn't get 5 stars, it is a great little table."
2,Table useful. Stools not.,The table is functional and looks good. Rolls well. The stools wobble constantly and legs must be retightened after every use.I would not let guests think about using them.I would not recommend this set.
4,Good little setup,Very compact and easy to use and move around in a small area. Chairs don't fit inside too well because of poor wood cutouts. But for this price who can complain. It is real wood not the recycled Ikea stuff so it supports anything I have put on it.
2,loose screws,the product is as pictured and serves well any space saving needs - the only problem is the screws do not want to stay put - even with two adults tightening them - a few still want to work their way out - I thought about buying an electric drill with hex head attachments to see if I could tighten up the screws more - I am still waiting for one hex head screw or bolt that was missing
4,Perfect for small apartments,"Purchased this table after struggling to find a set that would fit inside our tiny apartment without overwhelming the space. The height and space work perfectly for my partner and I and it's such a relief to have a table to eat on, rather than my lap! I docked a star due to the quality of the wood. You get a great deal for the price point, but it will be interesting to see how it holds up."
1,"Ironically, this DVD is depressing! Will make things worse!","The very first scene is someone crying and sad music, and it just stays the same from thereonout. We watchthis to learn about depression, not to get more depressed- SKIPthis one."
1,Shelby GT40 Only for the Blue Oval Fans.,"I don't really care for the blue oval or mopar or Ferrari so my allegiance is obvious that being said,there is nothing wrong with the book per se, I like the Chaparrals in the book, good photography and text along with funny interviews from Bob Bondurant among others. I would recommend checking the book out first.Dave Friedman's work is excellent but usually on the same ford Related subjects with the exception of the Beautiful Grand Sport."
3,Not a good movie,"I can't wonder why Teresa Russell's career stalled - this just isn't a good movie, regardless of the fact that Will patton is playing a priest. No wonder I'd never seen it before. I can't recommend this film to anyone but the stars' staunchest fans."
4,Loved it!,Sabriye is such an inspiration. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It certainly shows what determination and self belief can achieve. Well done! Some of us sighted would do well to learn from her.
2,A by-the-numbers psychological thriller.,"The fact that Adam Dalgliesh, the detective hero of James's ""The Black Tower"" never really SOLVES anything is indicative of the half-hearted nature of the rest of this novel. There are some interesting psychological portraits here if you can see your way through the hazy, credibility-stretching dialogue. But the thrill is lacking...we see every murder coming from miles away, and by the time the culprit finally makes himself clear, we are not only unsurprised, but fairly bored."
4,Great!,"The movie bullets the book, it is just like the book.Its a 3 hour long documentary about 2 teen african american having the hoop dreams and going to St Josef, and eventually one gets kicked out of the private school because of financial problems and goes to public school,and the other kid gets injured big time, but that doesn't stop these african american kids from having their hoop dreams, eventually they make it to college on a scholarship off of basketball, but they really didn't make it into the NBA.It guides you through their school years fresh-senior, and tackles what every other normal teens go through."
5,A Documentary Masterpiece,"The producer/directors showed great skill and patience by following their two Chicago youth through their teenage basketball lives. Over several years the filmakers showed up at the right time and captured the right images to convey the complete story, both on and off the court.This film is so well done that is voluminious length (it had an intermission when it played in the theater) seems to fly by and actually leave you wanting more at the end. I can only hope this long awaited DVD release will have the bonus features that will deliver that more that all who saw this movie wanted.This is not just a great basketball film but a great all around movie that will suck you in and make you care."
5,"In a nutshell, the best ever","Without a doubt Hoop Dreams is the finest movie that I've ever seen, or will ever see. After viewing it for the first time, my attitude towards life transcended a little (or a lot), and now I know what life is. I've never even met Arthur or William, and I know all about them. Kudo's go to Steve James and his group, for realizing that this is quite a story to document. I do not see how anyone can not love this summit of expression of life."
1,Nasty,"All the nasty anecdotes Mr. Shipman didn't have room for in the nasty re-writes he did of his (excellent) ""Great Movie Stars"" books. His vendettas against certain stars and critics (Ginger Rogers, Charlie Chaplin, Pauline Kael) are as bewildering as his blind admiration of others. Skip this and hunt for the first editions (circa 1970-72) of the Movie Stars books."
3,A Bit Pedantic,"This ""gentle"" guide to chakra activation is so gentle that it put me to sleep and not in a good way. Still, it does offer insight into an interesting form of yoga. For those of you doing yoga-as-sport, kundalini may not be your style. For those of you doing yoga-as-spritual-practice, kundalini may be just right. I suggest going to the library or taking a class about it before purchasing a book. It will make more sense that way."
3,"Good book, bad ebook","I got this book for a class and it is a great book. It is very inspirational and a great resource for people who want to work in ministry.But...I noticed there are many spots in the book where sentences are chopped and missing. I am really disappointed about this. There are multiple spots in the book where I honestly can't tell what the guy is saying because I don't know how much is missing. It could be just a couple words or multiple sentences. Like I said, I really like the book, but buy it on paperback and not as an ebook."
2,Thumbs down from grandson,"My six year old grandson enjoyed the Moffats when his mom read it to him, and she told me he'd like the CD. Wrong. However, he did love the other CD we bought him: The Bears on Hemlock Mountain."
5,The little treasures in life,"This book makes you notice all the little treasures around you, each and everyday. It consists of harmless-everyday humour that you will undoubtedly love. It's for all ages, from young to old. The story plot and all the little details are for you to find, so I must not reveal it. However, I gaurantee you that you'll never be able to put the book down!"
4,Easy Homebrew Kit!,"I got Mr. Beer for my husband and he loves it! Just follow some simple directions, wait a couple weeks, and you end up with beer you made yourself. There are many different varieties to try and you can find recipes to make many more."
3,Everything is great minus the missing tap/spigot,"The kit is great, I'm really excited to make my beer. I never received a spigot/tap for the fermenting container, and without it there's a large hole sitting empty with no feasible way to plug it or dispense the finished product into bottles. I ordered the premium kit, so the ingredients, bottles, ""keg"", everything came with -- except that. Amazon is shipping me out a new kit, but I have to mail the old one back. Not a big deal EXCEPT I'm in Afghanistan and mailing things to and from isn't that easy. I went to the Mr. Beer website and ordered 2 spigots this time so that just in case the new kit doesn't have one either, I'll have 2 spigots for the 2 kits I have. Then I can brew 2 batches simultaneously :)"
4,Nice brewing kit if you want to have some fun,I have used this about 4 times now and have been happy with each batch. The instructions are easy to use and it seems to do a good job fighting contamination; easier to sterilize than some other kits I have tried over the years. Be ready for some fun if you buy it but cleaning the bottles are a lot of work so be warned about that
2,Its a good gag gift,"I bought this cause I thought it would be neat. The beer smelled great and you get to learn a lot about how beer is made. After a day of the beer being in the barrel I noticed a small leak by the spigot. You have to sanitize everything and I wasn't sure what to put the beer in to retighten the spigot. Well, I got it all out and went to tighten it more and it broke. It also said in the book that you have to put sugar in the beer when you bottle it to carbonate it, which I thought was odd... but I never got that far. I thought this was an ok item and was a good starting point. I have since upgraded to a nicer system with Co2 cartridges for carbonation."
1,El Libro de la Selva,Wrong cassette instead of the movie I received the cartoon movie. In very bad shape the picture on the outside of the video was ripped off.Very disappointed!!
2,jungle book review,The cover was in much worse shape than the person implied. Otherwise the tape was in good condition.
5,jungle book,"It was a fast delivery. The disc was scratch free and worked flawlessly as soon as i got it. To me with all the movies that i have, this one looked new even tho the description said it was used. VERY VERY HAPPY WITH IT!"
2,I must be drinking something else...,"I'm really not a picky person, but this stuff is horrible. It tastes awful, even when I add honey. My stomach doesn't like it either, I'm always burping & I get a nasty aftertaste. Within maybe an hour of drinking it my stomach will start to hurt and I feel a little nauseous. I recommend buying one box in store to test out before buying in bulk no matter what the other reviews say."
5,"Take awhile to get used to the taste, but it grows on me","When I first tried this tea, I was thinking - wow! this is some different tea I have had in my life. I like it actually changes my taste buds after I drank it daily. I am on my quest to achieve my goal weight, and I found that this tea helps me not craving sweets anymore which if you are losing weight, this is a big plus. It's a wonder and it helps me go to the restroom more often. On those days I am having my period, I drank the tea and it smoothed my cramps too. I brought some in to share with my co-workers, somebody like them, some dislike them. It's really a personal preference. For me, this is going to be a staple in my kitchen pantry."
3,Nice But Dated,I wanted to like this s/w because my son loves Curious George. Guess I should have read the first review which is 12 years old! Very dated in the interface and what you can do. Look elsewhere.
4,Really good except for Italian diction,"I feel kind of bad giving this CD only four stars, because in spite of its faults (or, I should say, ""fault""), I have gotten quite a lot of enjoyment out of it, and there are certainly many good things about it.The only reason for the four stars is Minter's diction. His voice is beautiful, his phrasings tasteful, his coloratura clean and articulated, and his trills just fantastic--but the Italian is not quite there. Although it is technically correct in almost all ways, it simply lacks the rhythm that an Italian singer would have given it.That said, I would still recommend the CD for a non-singer/non-Italian speaker. Being a singing teacher and Italian speaker, I notice these things, but I doubt most people would. Those who didn't would find the selections delightful and would be impressed by Minter's otherwise flawless performance."
4,A Beautiful Ending to the Star Wars Saga,"Film composer extraordinaire John Williams closes out the Star Wars saga on a good note (no pun intended). Those who currently own other Star Wars sheet music will notice that this book includes previously published pieces such as ""The Force Theme"" and ""End Title/Credits"". However, the hauntingly sorrowful ""Anakin's Dark Deeds"" and the fast paced Maestoso ""Battle of the Heroes"" in orchestration take the viewer on an emotional roller coaster that has ""Duel of the Fates"" like intensity. This book, written for piano solo, is a farily accurate representation of the soundtrack. However, you will find that some of the pieces are not in their original key and require tranposition to be played along with the soundtrack. For a fan of John Williams or Star Wars, this is a book worth having in your collection."
4,"Well, yes and no.","These things are very nice and hold up really well. Unfortunately, I had to buy this huge (!!) box of 100 double cases because I couldn't find a smaller quantity. Still, you can't beat it for the price - it works out to 25 cents each!"
4,Phoenix Mars Mission-How about a happy ending?,"This was a fine DVD (four star) as far as it went, but ended with the launch. If anyone reads this review and is aware of a good DVD available from Amazon that documents the Phoenix mission to date or at least a bit further, I would appreciate being told via comment. I have searched for it and failed to find it. I have also searched Google.I was able to find the following at Amazon (anyone know anything about this?):The Phoenix Mars Mission: Up from the Ashes (2007) with no image and only the following as a product description.Product Description:The University of Arizona Launch Aug. 2007 Landing May 2008 / Length 7:53Available from these sellers.2 new from $59.00 5 used from $1.50"
2,Not worth it...,"I was very disappointed with the performance of this card. It worked fine with the games that were shipped along with it, but beyond those games this card is good for nothing. Poor options, many textures were distorted and discolored. If you were planning on upgrading from the Diamond Viper to this, take my advice and stick with what you have."
5,Fantastic acting and heartwarming story,"I was watching the movie on the WE network and just had to order the DVD. This was fabulously done and a real ""must see"" by thoseseeking tounge-in-cheek romantic drama."
2,Didn't like this too well,"Good green tea has a subtle, fresh, ""green"" flavor that's hard to describe. It's fresh and light, and some describe it as ""grassy."" This tea is OK, but it has an undertone that is a little off for me. Maybe because it's decaf. I've tried several brands of green decaf, and none are good. Maybe green tea just doesn't lend itself to decaffeinating. I rated this one two stars because I didn't hate it, as one star denotes, but didn't like it much either. I'm partial to regular (caffeinated) Japanese green teas, and the genuine ones are the best."
2,"Good for my skin, but...","It tastes awful, I would mix it with herbal peppermint and other flavors and I could still taste it. Having said that I brew tea pretty strong..Every time I would drink it I would get really nauseous, even if I had just eaten. It may just be me, but I wont buy it again, it is the only tea to do that.Anyway it did make my skin glow, and I love yogi tea products.. Just not this one it wasn't worth the upset stomach."
5,GREAT SWISS WATCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Excellent watch. Really like this brand. Works perfectly, fancy watch. After buying this one (which is expensive) I decided to buy another one, a little cheaper."
2,No more DLP's for me.,"I bought this TV in July 2006. The picture quality on SD and HD is excellent. What I don't like about rear projection is the limited viewing angle.On May 14, my TV lost video. I called Samsung and it has been 4+ weeks and I still don't have my TV. They had to replace the lamp, ballast and the DMD board. The TV is great as long as it is working but I wouldn't trust one to work for very long. I researched these for quite a while before buying and all of the reviews were good.If I were buying today my first choice would be flat panel LCD if money was no object, but since it is with me, I would go with a plasma because I believe it is the best bang for the buck at current market prices (June, 2007). 42 inches seems to be the break point. At 42 and below LCD and plasma seem to be about the same price but plasma wins the value contest at 50 inches and above.Tip: If you are visiting a store to look at TV's and you wear glasses (sometimes, like I do), make sure and take them."
1,do not buy!!,This tv was great for the 1st 1 1/2yrs. It completely died then. luckily we bought an exended warranty & it was fixed after about 3 wks. worked okay until now. 5 yrs old. just had a tech come ck it out. picture is neon pink & green static. tech called today- $600 to repair. and it is going to get repaired w/ same part they know is defective! no more samsungs. tech said they are 75% of his business.
3,"pscyh rock fans will like this maybe, for alice completists","I like psych rock but this is so loose and sloppy that it's hard to really grasp it often. It's space out music without consistancy, if this band hadn't changed to hard rock metal then they'd have been doomed, most psych rock is better than this even , spacey but better produced, as in lets have one line of movement, not jump around flaying. Ok, so why give it three stars? because in spite of this stuff the band does show promise , the promise of what would become a great band. The first two cooper cds are for completists and garage psych rock fans only.Casual fans need to go to the classic 'love it to death' a masterpiece of early metal to see how good they became."
1,please seek better alternatives.,"I'm a stat grad student, and my teacher unfortunately chose this book as the reference text. The abundance of typos in the book takes away from my confidence in the presentation. Also I find that the exercises sometimes lack the appropriate conditions for them to make sense. Also, the listing of theorem, lemmas, examples is very confusing; for instance, you will find theorem, say 2.1.1, comes after example 2.1.16; sometimes one example will appear over and over in different sections, and the text does not remind you the conditions, so you will find yourself flipping through page and pages trying to find them. This book makes me hate this class, the material from which I used to love. Do yourselves a favor and stay away from this book, it will ruin theoretical statistics for you."
5,reader's digest songbook,My wife took the book to a nursing home where she sings songs with the elderly and they enjoyed the songs very much. A very good purchase.
5,"DIVORCED DADS, A BETTER WAY TO GO","Divorced Dads: 101 Ways is an elegantly useful book to experience your children and have them remember you in the best of ways. This book offers practical support on how to parent as a divorced dad while encouraging you to live your life more fully with your children. There are practical, useful chapters on communication, parenting skills per se, and how to make learning fun with your children. This book is full of tips as well as encouragement for your sense of fathering in a very loving way. I recommend this book."
1,"Cheap made, horrible plastic hinges, waste of money.",The battery organizer case is a good idea but it is so cheaply made. One of the flimzy plastic hinges broke as soon as I opened the case to check it out. The inner compartments are nice but the case hinges are horrible. Total waste of money. I am returning it for a refund.
4,El Salvador redux,"Please ""get into this book!"" The rights of journalists, ordinarypeople in a struggle not of their making fill this small sampleof what happened to them compels your attention. It often reads like a play script, then socks you into its purpose as a political novel. I took a few brief ""rests"" to contemplate the force of Bencastro's ardent script! It is a sensitive version of Latin American guerrilla warfare and the ""inhumanitarian"" rules of their martial law inflicted upon the citizens of El Salvador."
1,Stay away if you don't want to get stuck!,"I owned this alarm in my Buick car for several years. Well, I went on a long trip about 200 miles from my house. When we were ready to leave and go home, this security system wouldn't let us in! The system kept shutting off my engine and locking the doors. We ended up having to pay for AAA to tow the car home while we rode home in a tow truck--completely embarrassing. Needless to say, we had the system uninstalled the next morning.To top it off, the remotes are cheaply made and fall apart after just a few weeks of use--and are next to impossible to replace. Stay away!"
4,"THANKS TO ""PSYCH OUT"" FILM MANY KNOW WHO THE SEEDS ARE","I had never heard of ""The Seeds"" before, until i purchased the DVD ""Psych Out/The Trip"", back in October 2003~~I like them. I heard ""Pushin' too Hard"" on the radio recently and ""Pointing Two fingers at You"" from the film ""Psych Out"" sound identical.I am not criticizing, just commenting~~ but i like the sound~~Sky Saxon has his own website, and has added the word ""Sunlight"" to his name~~I enjoy the vintage music of the 1960's, and this is a definite plus to own~~"
2,A band *way* overstaying its welcome,"The only reason I gave this disc 2 stars instead of 1 is because ""Pushin' Too Hard"" was such a cool song, Ramones-like in its simplicity as it was. However, the previous reviewer is dead on when he intimates that once you've heard this Seeds song, you've heard them all. Even the solos are all exactly alike, never mind the songs!"
4,FIRST RATE!,"I am not a fan of the sound of a counter-tenor. I would prefer to hear much of the same repertory sung by a mezzo, say Marilyn Horne or Rise Stevens. That said, Andreas Scholl continues to surprise me. His is not the whiny, nasal sound I associate with a counter-tenor. He has a bright, expressive voice of great passion. And this album does not disappoint. Most of the songs were new to me although I'd heard a few of them in modern arrangements for voice and guitar on other albums such as the superb ""Elizabethan Lute Songs"" on RCA Gold Seal sung by Sir Peter Pears accompanied by Julian Bream. Also it must be noted that Scholl's command of English is absolute. One would never imagine that English were not his first language."
4,"great for fine, frizzy hair","This product works great for my fine, wavy hair. Because I color and straighten my hair, it tends to get frizzy. However, my hair is fine and many anti-frizz products weigh it down. This gets rid of the frizz AND gives body to my hair. My hair dresser stopped stocking it, so I'm glad I found it on Amazon!"
4,Good ..With some Tweak,"Bought this router since I am moving to a new place. Previous routers are Linksys or 3com. So time to try Belkin. Initial impression, looks are impressing.Setting up is easy.There are some problems that I encountered i.e. losing connection, etc, but after research the internet, things can be solved by upgrading the firmware to the latest one.Now, I am happy with the Belkin N1.So if you have problem with your Belkin, try this:1. Upgrade your firmware (Sometimes, you need to get the beta version from Belkin UK - since its not in the USA Belkin website)2. Make sure your Qos turned off3. Turn on the Signal to (20+40 hz).Then it will solve all the Belkin problems.vpn, voip (SIP device), all works fine after that.Do I recommend this product? YupIf you are a beginner and wants to buy this router, ask your friend to help you to upgrade the firmware and setting up."
2,Slow performance,I was impressed on how easy it was to setup this router until I started running some performance tests on it and found out it was 4 times slower than my wired Linksys router using either the wired or wireless ports.I tried updating the firmware to the latest version and when I did it was unable to see my DSL modem without reverting back to the previous version. So I returned it.
4,"Not perfect, but close","Now I must start off with that I was a Linksys/Cisco fan for a very long time. It wasn't until my WRT54G died that I decided to try something new. This was priced right for me at the time, so bought this with the free shipping and out of the box it worked like a charm. Now I gave this a 4 out of 5 due to the config cd not even working. Not a big deal, and don't need it since it was a cinch to setup. Now for the inexperienced I would still buy this if you want the faster dl speed, and better range (and pretty blue lights)...just make sure the cd is working. Otherwise it might prove to be a bit much to setup. It even has a connection light for those that just use wifi (shows inet is active). So no real need to use the ports if you're not intending to."
1,What happened to Belkin!,"I have seven or so older, dual antenna ""F5D7231"" models around our facility setup as WAP's (Wireless Access Points) and they have been working good for years with out even a reboot. So with that in mind I purchased the N1. But this model has been nothing but a nightmare of corrupt settings. I've set up many large networks (70+ users) and programmed and optimized gigabit ethernet LAN's for post production video and audio file transfers. But this unit defies reason, any attempt to customize menu settings creates a different problem. Many times the router would stop transmitting but still function wired. To get it going again I would have to reset to factory default and even then some other problem would arise, not assigning DHCP's, losing communication with the modem and more. The unit shipped with the latest firmware so no relief there. The F5D7230 isn't much better either."
1,Belkin N1 wireless router: easy install but undependable,"The Belkin N1 Wireless Router is by far the easiest to install of the 6 or so different systems I've set up. It's also the only router I've had to send in for warranty...TWICE. Each time the router worked flawlessly for about a month. Then it quit broadcasting SSID despite Setup reconfigurations, reboots, etc. Tried different channels, wireless modes, even turned the protected mode and security features off. Called support both times (outsourced to India) and they couldn't fix it either. Now I don't even want a replacement unit, I'm going back to my old faithful Linksys WRT54GL which has performed well since day one (besides the need to reboot it once or twice a year)."
1,Disappointed,"This is the first Wireless router i've tried. At first I was impressed because the directions and setup were a breeze. However, like all the other negative reviews here, the problem with this router is that it will drop/hang your connection after you get it to work. I've even updated the firmware, which I thought helped at first but the connection only lasted a few minutes longer. After using it for about 5-10 minutes, both Wired and Wireless connections freeze and stop working. I'm so disappointed; it's such a nice looking router and was at a decent price. I'll be returning this tomorrow and shopping for a new one."
3,"Great Router, as long as there is no interference","I have found this unit to provide an always solid connection, it's range isn't as good as others, but it isn't bad. This unit however, does not work well in area of interference. When I first got the unit it would drop signal periodically, as soon as I bought a dect 6 phone to replace my 5.4g phone it was solid and fast.Recently I moved into a condo from my house. Now I have 4 or 5 wireless neighbors interfering with my signal. The connection stays solid as a rock, but the through put has slowed to a crawl and is bursty. Even in the same room four feet from the device. I've tried many settings and frequencies, but even going to a lower used frequency group (1 in my environment) it doesn't help much.Overall it's a great AP, but functions poorly in environments with any rf interference. If you have a high interference environment (apartments or condos), I would advise trying something else."
1,don't waste your time,"This router had lots of problems connecting to various websites. I contacted Belkin, who responded promptly, that it was a known issue and they advised me to make changes on my wireless devices to correct the issue. I attemped it and had varied success but it just isn't possible on some of my devices.Why bother with a router that needs this kind of tweaking when you can go elsewhere."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ROUTER!,"Once in a while products do come deffective, but you call their customer service number and most companies would take responsibility for their products, well, Belkin does not.The router that i got cannot connect two wired or wireless devices at the same time. The tech support people do not know S... about their product.Do yourself a favor, do not buy Belkin."
1,WORST ROUTER EVER - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME,"I have purchased more than 10 routers in the last 10 years - including the Belkin pre-N router which was a pretty good router. I bought the N1 thinking it would be at least as good as the pre-N. Wrong! This thing is a step back into the dark ages. Unreliable connectivity. Horrible range. Poor interface with USB adapter.All in all, I would steer VERY clear of this router. It is a waste of money and, more importantly, a huge waste of time trying to get it working and then, trying to keep it working. Don't go N unless you have to. And if you have to, look elsewhere for a reliable N router."
2,Good Name But,"New Hope isn't really the most haunted town in the US. Frankly I've seen houses with more activity then every historical site in New Hope combined. Don't get me wrong I love New Hope. I grew up their (I still live near by), and I began my lifes work as a ghost hunter in New Hope. The Logan Inn was the first haunted site I ever researched (for a school newspaper article), I've done the ghost tours bit, and been in a lot of the sites on this show. The show though is badly done. Its format is very flat and uninteresting. Like far to many amateurs they obsess over orbs (which are hands down the least interesting and most easily explained of all ""psychic"" photography) and some of there other pictures are questionable as well. I would suggest the books of the late Mary Adi Kent instead of this documentary."
2,Interesting possibilites that go NOWHERE!,"The premise of the documentary is very interesting, and many of the persons appearing in the film such as P.D. Cacek, and other residents of New Hope, lend credibility to the claims of paranormal events occuring at different inns or B&B's in the town, however it goes downhill after they bring in the ""sensitive?"" Cathe Curtis. If she's psychic, I'm the Queen of England! I give it 2 stars because I did enjoy the interviews with the ""normal"" residents of New Hope, and with the music used throughout the documentary, especially the closing track ""Her"" by Claire Voyant. I'm really thankful I rented this DVD through my rental program, and didn't waste money buying it. In other words.... it's not a keeper!"
2,LOVE YOU FOR THAT!,"This video TORE ME UP! I have everyone saying LOVE YOU! I LOVE YOU FOR THAT! It is a scream when she is talking to the Orb"" at the end! LMFAO! Hi Robert! Youre' beautiful....thank you for that...LOVE YOU FOR THAT!!! LOL!"
1,Not Much Here..,"Hands down, the worst ghost documentary. Nothing here but 'orbs' and badly told tales of hauntings by people with less than half a brain. Plus most of the orbs are obvious camera flares.In short, nothing more here than an author filming locations in their hometown, which they abruptly claim is the scariest. PLEASE AVOID AT ALL COSTS"
1,is this a comedy??,"This has to be the worst dvd i've ever seen. Period. Cathe Curtis is a complete joke and an embarrassment to the human race. She passes off dust particles as orbs and says ""i love you"" to them, my girlfriend and I are huge ghost hunters fans and fans of the paranormal in general, this was just ridiculous and boring. We sat and watched this dvd and just laughed the whole time, and to think there's a disclosure at the beginning of the ""documentary"" that the images shown were not fabricated digitally in any way....like that needed to be known, every picture is of her and an ""orb""(dust).DONT PURCHASE OR RENT UNLESS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A REASON TO GET OUT OF DEPRESSION, THIS WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH."
5,"Stylish, Well Made & Unbreakable See Update Below",I purchased this pitcher to determine it's quality. The first thing out of the box I did was to bang it on our heavy wooden table. I did it many times and could not break it.I'm a big guy and my wife thought I was nuts. I wanted to determine if the handle was attached properly and if it would hold up for my Wife's catering company.It pours fluids well and is very stylish. It will go with any type of place settings.Highly recommend this product.Will be ordering 12 more in the very near future.Buy them 12 at a time and save $$$ at:Prodyne PF-54 Forever Polycarbonate 54 Oz. Pitcher - Pack of 12UPDATE: Price of 12 single purchase has gone down. It's cheaper to buy 12 singles then the previous 12 at a time.Save about $11.00 if bought by singles.
5,We loooove them!,"The clips arrived very quickly, and they are exactly what we were looking for. We are using them to hang our baby's crib-0size quilt until he is ready to use it. They were really easy to hang (just one nail for each clip) and it took only minutes to get them up. The quilt has been hanging for a couple weeks now, and they haven't slipped even a bit. They are cute and match the jungle theme perfectly. We are now considering buying a few more items from Little Elephant Company to add to his room since they also offer personalized products!"
5,Loved it,"Beautiful story with fixation of survival and success. I wish I can meet this man in person and give my respects with what he went through and how he survived with his intelligence, courage, and strength."
2,"Legible, pero no está en verso","El texto es completo y correcto.Pero luego de las primeras páginas, el texto está de corrido, sin los finales de línea de cada verso, lo cual hace la lectura difícil y un poco extraña."
3,HP 30S is ok...,"I have many HP calculators. I bought the 30S to see how it worked and felt.The 30S works (and looks) almost exactly like the Texas Instrument 30X-IIS (which I really don't like).I am really disappointed in HP's vision for it's new low-end calcs. I don't think the interchangeable faceplates of different colors makes for a better calculator.If you want a good HP calc, get the 10B for financial and 32II for scientific. And, if you have the money, get the 48GX. This calc really kicks *ss....."
4,"A good look at competitive, on-water rowing...","This book is primarily for those who row on water, rather than those who use an erg indoors, as I do. That being said it's a great book, crammed full of important and relevant information.It has detailed tips on improving technique, comprehensive explanations of what kind of training to do to achieve a certain goal, description on how to write a training program, and competiton strategies. It gets very specific in several areas regarding strength, endurance, power, and how to increase all of these. There are charts and graphs, diagrams and photos, the works!I only wish the author had given more focus to erg rowing, but even without that this is an excellent resource for anyone who rows, whether on land or on the water."
2,SOULLESS - TAKE NO SURVIVORS!,"A movie that makes no sense. We open with a young girl being attacked by two men who drain her blood and kill her. Then we go on to this bunch of kids going off to college. They go to this strange club in an old church and on the way home they are in a supposed ""accident"" and all survive except for Ben Affleck's brother.From there on, this ""Carnival of Souls"" rip-off fails to come to grips with this psychological babble. There's no real suspense and the ending is contrived and unbelievable. Shame on Luke Wilson for his presence, but his holier than thou priest was believable.Rent, don't buy."
1,Why waste your money.,"I don't know what is wrong with most films made these days. I went into seeing this movie open-minded and ended up being greatly disappointed. I would rather watch I Still Know What You Did Last Summer 40 times over that see this again. Thankfully it's only 80 minutes long. My main concern is that why did Wes Bentley go do this after being in a great movie, American Beauty? Why did he make such a great step down/downgrade? Oh well, I guess his career will end up being as bad as Casey Affleck's."
1,"Oh Horror, thou art so horrible...","A woman is attacked by two strange men who cut open her wrist and drain her blood. Cassandra goes to a party with her friends and her boyfriend sees her kiss another guy who is her ex-boyfriend. This results in her boyfriend getting upset and ignoring her while they are driving away from the party. Meanwhile there is a car passing with two strange men and a woman. The passing car ends up spinning and Cassandra drives straight into the car. When Cassandra wakes up after the accident things are beginning to turn bizarre around her. Soul Survivors has no storyline, extremely poor characters, and a script that seems to lack sentences of any meaning, which results in a horrendously poor cinematic experience."
5,Don't leave civilization without it,"Here you can find, in one book, everything that pertains to enjoying the wild country responsibly and safely. Will is deeply committed to the principles of ""leaving no trace"", so wild areas are left untouched for future generations to enjoy. The book covers parks, mountains, deserts, snow and ice, beaches, rivers, lakes, wetlands and every other kind of terrain. It includes extensive treatments on how to deal with wildlife, bears and even snowboarders. You won't find this wealth of information in any other book. Don't leave civilization without it."
5,Nice!,"These are exactly as described, although I thought that the ""solid gold bezel meant there would be solid gold on the back of the earring. The jade is set into the bezel and the bezel surrounds the jade heart. The quality of the gold and the jade are excellent."
3,What can one say,Kenny Rogers makes a great western person I have alot of his other one I bought this to add to my Western DVD collection
5,The Illuminator - Love and Life in the middle ages,"Here is an excellent historical fiction novel set in the middle ages, when love had little to do with marriage, and women were often chattel to their fathers, husbands, and lords/kings. Into this time of the rapacious church, of greedy priests and the selling of indulgences, a time of intolerence comes an illuminator, an illustrator of religious texts, Mn with secrets and a teen-aged daughter, whom the church asks to house with a newly widowed young womwn and her sons, who are coming onto manhood. This is a love story, an intimate look at the times, from the lowest serf, the landed gentry, to lords and the king. It is well-written, well-researched, and compelling. It is the first in a trilogy across generations."
2,All for Not!,The story was good but the ending was oh so painful. I would never be able to recommend this book to anyone because of that. :(
1,Really lousy research!,"The author needs to do a little more historical research. I would have thought that a PhD in Library Sciences would have taught her the skills of researching. She has confused the 14th Century with the 16th Century. Her idea of period dress goes much better 200 years in the future with laced up bodices, skirts, ""petticoats"" and snoods. The middle-class land-owners, yeomen, have been reduced to paid servants. The ""shilling"" makes a surprising introduction about 100 years too early and Laudanum, a tincture of poppy (opium) is way out of place by 400 years (poppy was available, just not as laudanum). There are so many more inaccurate historical falsities that it was driving me crazy. I started keeping a list! I will say that some of what she has written about the priest John Wycliffe was well done, but. . . it was not enough to save this book. So if you don't like poorly done history, don't get this book. It will only disappoint you!"
3,It ain't bad,"It wasn't great, I've read better, but it wasn't horrible. Well written. I recommend it."
2,not very satisfied,"1. there was no any bonus (pillow set), i had to purchase it separatily2. all this sheet set colored my matress (the matress now has pink color not everywhere - but with spots, what i suppose to do with it?)3. sheets are soft and i like the material.4. delivery was good - even faster then i expected"
5,Lovely Sheets,"These sheets are very nice! Crisp and soft at the same time. I would recommend them highly, esp. at the price I paid. Need to find the pillow cases to match, though. They weren't on sale at the time I purchased the sheets...hmmmm?"
1,Way bad,Way bad. The sheets were like one offs and for the thread count they weren't soft. Awful! I can't believe it.
4,I love the sheets,"I washed them and they fit perfectly, nice and deep. They grow softer every time I wash them. Great buy!"
1,KING SHOULD SUE,"Why Stephen King would even let someone use the title of his short story for this supposed ""sequel"" is a mystery to me. This movie is so lamebrained and contrived, dull and lifeless, acted by a troupe of pretty awful actors, including the usually dependable Lance Henriksen. Other than Will Sanderson, the rest of the cast is really, really bad...especially the lead character of Jo. The movie seems to exist only to show off some buff bodies and watch them run throughout the building in slow mo; the director also liked using that filming the same shot from minutely different angles, for what purpose, only he can tell. The extras interview this bunch of clowns, and director/writer Michael Wright looks and acts like some high school drama teacher; they also spend time saying how many ""weird"" things happened during the filming. I certainly wouldn't make the mistake I did and buy this clunker!!!"
2,"Not perfect, but not complete crap either.","I bought this case for my 30 gig video. You could call the case snug, which is a good thing in my opinion. The plastic over the click wheel tended to bubble up a little, so I cut it out after a few days. After some slight modifications, the case works alright.My only real complaint is the buckle for the caribiner strap. It put a nice scratch right down the front of the screen, right in the middle. Other than that, the strap stays snapped down with the clips on the back and the caribiner is a pretty convenient handle. That scratch is more than enough to get me looking for a new case though. If you don't plan on ever taking your ipod out of it's case, then this cover would work. If not, keep looking."
4,"""Snarl"" feature questionable","This two-pack gives anyone all they need to start a major battle between the forces of good and evil. Both figures are incredibly detailed and loads of fun. However, the so-called snarl feature on mine, a little lever on the back of each figure that changes the expression on the figure's face, just made Wolvie open and close his mouth and made Sabertooth's eyes bug out in something that looked more like a ""Help, I swallowed Toad"" expression than a snarl. Also, you can't keep the face in snarl mode, it reverts back to mild-mannered when you release the lever. Still... action figures with changeable expressions! Never seen something like that before. This entire line of figures is incredible, and a great deal of fun! Definetly worth it."
1,Why wouldn't you buy the real book?,"I'm confused. I have a beautiful copy of The Antiquities of Jordan, Revised Edition published in 1979 by Jordan Distribution Agency, printed in Great Britain. Why is my copy listed for $5 and this photocopy worth so much more? Please explain it to me, thanks."
2,write again.,"....This calculator is really bad. it requires about 1/4 second delay for every simple calculation(e.g. 1+1=2, 2*2=4). it takes even longer for a more ""complex"" calculation (e^x, log, arctan...).I'm am engr graduate student at Penn State. There are lots of HP equipments in my lab and they are great. I just can't imagine how a HP graphing calculator can be so slow. ...i give it 2 stars because it's light and fancy. but if you are a serious calculator user, forget about this one."
3,Missing Blanks,"Forget Tae Boe. Billy should have kept doing karate movies. This movie was filled with action. The fight scene at the end between Billy and his real life brother was great as was the grand finale between Blanks and Wold Larson's character. Neither Blanks nor this movie would have ever been nominated for an Oscar, but for sheer entertainment and great karate action, Blanks, Charles Daniels and Michael Worth are second to none. Most of the time they will have a good story wrapped around these great fight scenes. So what separates Blanks from the other thousand karate movies out there? Personality. He can also act. This was a good movie. About what I expected since what I expected was not a dull moment. Wold Larson is also very good as the villain. He is a great in roles where he has such fight scenes as I have seen him in a karate movie before. This movie was only missing in the romance department. Other than that it shot no blanks. Great for us American star karate movie fans."
4,Great movie if you've worked with someone like Josh,I really enjoyed this film. I worked with an old friend of mine right out of college who responded to crisis in the same ways Josh does. Everything was a major crisis. This is a sweet movie but not for everyone will understand or like it.
1,"Give it up, Josh","Don't expect another Office Space with this one. The main character is pathetic, but not in any way that's endearing. The jokes are wishy-washy and bland and the plot is worse. I've been a slacker temp and I still didn't identify with this movie, or find it very funny."
1,"Pointless, self-congratulatory snoozefest","Thinking of buying Haiku Tunnel? Think again. Run away. FAST. I rented this film based on positive reviews online and on the back of the box - big mistake. I'm not certain who funded the writer/director/star/everything else, Mr. Kornbluth, but this person should be slapped for helping unleash this disaster. When I wasn't falling asleep during the lead's babbling asides to the camera, I was rolling my eyes at the corny, contrived dialogue (temp? perm? blah blah blah), desperately convoluted plot, and film-unfriendly theater-big performances. I understand this was based on Kornbluth's one-man show - it should have stayed that way. What likely was charming and vaguely amusing or poignant onstage falls flat on film. A must-avoid."
2,whatever,"Woo Hoo, another outrageously overpriced softbound pamphlet designed to bilk hardworking law students out of a few more bucks. Well, that was my first impression especially considering my professor's announcement that ""they give [him] lots of free books."" Gee, wonder why!Anyway, this is a grammar reference that clarifies some fine distinctions and is organized like an encyclopedia, with topics such as ""when or if"" and ""that or which."" The thing is, it's nothing you can't get from the Internet or in another, less costly grammar manual. If you don't have to, don't bother buying this book. I wouldn't buy it if I didn't have to.Thanks for reading."
4,Fascinating,"I had a sister who lived in Pawhuska,Oklahoma, many relatives, and friends. I visited Pawhuska many times-it was fascinating town. It was a very wealthy town with the OSAGE Indians , cattle barons, and oil . This book showed early history-the good and the bad. This town has a wealth of early history and people."
1,Plays Fast and Loose with the Truth,This book should be listed as a work of fiction - as most of what the author depicts as fact is not. Save your money and read the FBI files on the Osage Murders which you can find for free at [...].
4,dust collection,I've only used it for a few minutes but it seems to work very well and is so much more convenient than using a dust collection bag.
5,Good,I love Yogi tea in general. This one has a good taste and hopefully is good for us women too. I gave few tea bags to friends and they all love it.
5,"Don't love the taste, but it works!!","Until I started drinking this tea, I had not had a ""normal, natural"" period in years. I had to induce my period with Rx drugs about every three months or so. Since I started the tea in October 2010 (5-6 months now), I have had THREE natural periods, and have not had to induce even once. That is amazing! I also have a general increase in energy since I started drinking it, and have reduced my coffee intake to just one cup daily because of it.Unlike other reviewers, I don't love the taste... it tastes a bit like a celery tonic to me... however, I am slowly acquiring the taste and even if I wasn't I would still drink it for the health benefits, which are truly amazing."
4,Go with the Flow,"I really love this DVD, especially the Flow of Love. It's both intense and relaxing at the same time and leaves me with a nice high after I do it. Also, I have to credit this DVD with really helping me repair a messed-up psoas muscle (that's the one that connects the leg to the torso and is responsible for a lot of low-back pain). The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is that her instructions are not always 100% clear and I could understand how that might really bug some people, especially if you're a beginner. (I've kept a regular yoga practice for 6 years now, so I mostly know what she's talking about and can kind of go with the flow.)"
3,DVD quality bad - and not for beginners!,"This DVD is not for beginners. I've been practising yoga for two years and I found this tough to follow!Once I got the hang of it, I loved the routine!"
4,Good advice for every day people,"I'm a medical student and my loans for my medical education have skyrocketed and realized I need to plan a financially secure future NOW. In addition, I'm pursuing a master's degreee in business. In reading Mr. Tyson's book, I found lots of information that my business courses failed to explain or did explain but at a level way above my head. Like many other people, I would prefer an intimidating subject such as investing to be presented in clear, logical, plain and easily understandable English. Kudos to Eric Tyson for doing just that. I recommend this book especially for those with absolutely NO previous experience or knowledge in investing."
2,"Know ANYTHING about investing? If yes, not for you.","Very, very basic. If you are a true beginner then this is for you. But if you have one ounce of experience avoid this book and find something more in depth."
2,"""Easy Listening"" more appropriate than ""The Blues""","This 2 cd album is not the successor to ""From the Cradle"". I'm a big fan of Clapton, but I really think this is his worst album. There is more organ than guitar in some songs. The ""version 1"" release of ""Before you Accuse Me"" sound like Lay Down Sally - nothing like than the high-power original track on Journayman. The whole first disc is a crossover between Lay Down Sally and the Michelobe Lite version of After Midnight. It doesn't get any livlier than than. I haven't had the heart to pop in disc 2 yet. If you're a blues fan or a classic Clapton fan this is a disapointment. Stick with from the cradle and be satisfied."
4,Eric Clapton has much appreciation for the blues.,If you want to sample blues-Eric Clapton style- then this cd is for you! I bought it on a whim because I adore Eric Clapton and like the blues. Clapton sings some serious blues and his familiar guitar sound is evident throughout. A must-have for every Clapton fan!
4,Funny Horror,This movie features Joe Spinell in a creepy role as stalking killer. He goes to the cannes film festival an kills all the cute girls he finds. Also stars Caroline Munro in a sexy shower scene. This is a must see movie. You have to get it
2,"Great picture, unreliable","I have had this product for just about 3 years. The picture was great for the first two years and then it started showing a garbled input from certain sources. I found out that it was any SD signal (SNES, PS2, Analog channels). I decided to live with that. A few months later it started freezing and blacking out while I was watching TV or playing video games (different inputs). I loved this tv when I got it but I expect electronics to last more than 3 years.My recommendation is not to buy the extended warranty but buy a TV that the manufacture is willing to warranty for more than a year."
3,"interesting, but not up to date","this book is great, and is very informative, however it is not the most recent edition of the book. the newer edition is much more thorough."
2,Very General,This book provides very little specifics for the Cocker Spaniel breed. It's more of a training guide for raising a puppy. Save your money and buy a book more geared towards the Cocker Spaniel as a breed.
2,Great toy for the tone deaf!,"This item is extremely overpriced for what you get. The sound is awful and the song selection is limited. The instruments sound nothing like they would in ""real life"" and, for the price, they should. I'm a big fan of Neurosmith products (too bad they're O-O-B). If you can find them through other outlets (eBay, Overstock) - and are looking for products that truly represent what music should sound like - check them out (a few recommendations - Sunshine Symphony, Pet Me Platypus...or the music blocks).Overall, a good idea but poor delivery - improve on the sound quality."
4,Solid,"I bought this toy for my grandson on his first birthday. It is well made, very sturdy,colorful with great music sound. This I particularly liked because I find many musical toys have poor sounding music. He has been enjoying the Mozart Cube. It is the kind of toy that he won't outgrow for quite a while."
1,EXPENSIVE AND POORLY MADE,"This cube is quite large and heavy for the age group that it is marketed at. The end result is, it will fall out of those little chubby hands. But apparently Munchkin never thought of that because ours broke after our daughter dropped it a few times. She didn't drop it out of her high chair or anything, she just dropped it while playing with it on the floor. What a waste of money. I strongly suggest avoiding this toy."
2,Overstimulating,"I appreciate the idea behind this musical toy, but it's absolutely FRENETIC. Talk about toys creating passive, overstimulated babies...this is a prototype. The quality of the sound is great, but to have the lights flashing in a strobe-like fashion certainly makes my baby look away immediately. I can't stand it myself."
4,Baby loves it!,"My 11 month old grandson loved this toy -- dances to it with smiles all over. His big brother (9) wants to play with it too, having a greater understanding of the instruments. Their dad, 39, liked the option of adding or subtracting instruments from the mix. Good tunes, good fun."
4,Munchkin Mozart,The thing that I liked most about the Musical Munchkin Mozart Cube is that it is durable. My little guy drums on it and the music and lights keeps his attention.It was worth it!
2,"Too loud, not interesting","Based on the mostly positive feedback, I purchased this cube as a birthday present for my son's first birthday. He's not even slightly interested in the sound; my 4-year old pushed the buttons a few times, but complains that it's much too loud - unfortunately you can't control the volume. It really is too loud. The 1-year old pushed the buttons twice, and got very close in order to look at the blinking light, but that's it. The sound quality is also not the greatest, but it is a children's toy, so I didn't really expect it to be any better. So, neither one of my children plays with it or is actually interested in it, and the biggest drawback is the lack of volume control, since the toy is way too loud. I'm seriously considering returning it."
5,Mozart Cube is a favorite of my grandson,"My grand son has over 1,500 pieces of toys; mostly small die cast hot wheels but almost every single day since I gave him the Mozart Cube for Christmas, he's always playing a tune on it. This is a great way to get your kids acclimated to the real classics."
4,Glad we got it,I am glad we got this for our son. The lights are interesting and the music is nice. Much more tolerable than many other infant toys. My toddler daughter is just learning about instruments so this interests her as well. She enjoys picking the different instruments to hear.
4,Great toy but the sound isn't perfect,When I was thinking about purchasing this product I did notice that some of the one star reviews noted that the sound was so bad they couldn't take it. But a lot of those reviewers also claimed to have a musical ear or were instrument players. I am not either so I figured I wouldn't be as offended if the sound wasn't perfect. Well I have to say some of the instruments do sound pretty bad. The violin sounds like a cheap synthesizer and the quality of the other instruments isn't perfect. But overall I like the concept and I like the toy and my 16 month old enjoys it too.
5,Caleb's Mom,"This is a pretty good toy. My son loves anything that lights up, so this is great for him in that aspect. The music on this toy is enjoyable even for my husband and I too. I have to say that since my son is only 7 months old, he will probably like this toy more as he grows, but for now it doesn't hold his attention much. I read all reviews before I purchase anything since I'm a 1st time mom. I trust others to put honest feedback and I do so myself. I'd recommend this product! It's very well made."
2,Not all its cracked up to be,"The product is not as wonderful as I thought it was going to be. My son got tired of it very quickly. There is something about it that is simply lacking in entertainment value. Its very interesting the way the cube can isolate each particular instrument sound so that you can hear the songs played either with just a flute or the whole orchastra but my son who is just learning to appreciate music in general is not at all interested in that yet. Also, it doesn't play very many songs. You would think something called the ""Mozart Cube"" would have a selection of Mozart."
4,Game cube is fair for price,I liked this for my 6 month old son because it plays music and lights up. You can also press a couple of the buttons together or seperate and it plays together. It's neat and my son enjoys it.
5,Just learning things,My granddaugther just turned 1yr. old. She is learning to push and pull things. It seems to spart her attention. I was very happy with it. She seems to be also.
3,its alright,"at 6 mths, 7 mths, and 8 mths, my daughter doesn't get this toy and sort of stares at it and looks for something else to entertain herself. doesn't have many music options, but maybe when she is closer to a year she will appreciate the different instrument sounds and will figure out she can TURN OFF some sounds, while others stay on....otherwise, its off to the yard sale in the spring!"
1,Sounds like the batteries are dying even though they're not,"My daughter played with an Embryonics version of this toy and she really liked it. The sound was great and it was entertaining. I decided to order one since she enjoyed it so much and I found that there is a HUGE difference between the original version and the one they sell now. I had read the reviews on Amazon about the poor sound quality and I thought ""how bad could it really be?"" It's AWFUL. It is so out of tune that the batteries sound like they're dying even though they're not. I returned it immediately. If you can find an original Embryonics Mozart cube, get that instead as it is far superior to the Munchkin version."
1,Packaging FAIL,Sad that I had to to go Amazon reviews to figure out how to get the wires out of the cube. Used some pliers but as I pulled the wires out some of the plastic casing around the wires was stripped off and will forever be entombed within this God-forsaken cube.
3,Love it... but the packaging sucks,"We love the mozart magic cube. No, the sound isn't perfect (my husband and I both play multiple instruments). HOWEVER, our little guy loves it, and has figured out how to start and stop the various instruments as well as the full orchestra. We give this a 3/5 instead of a 4/5 due to the ridiculous packaging. It took us an hour to get the wire ties that attached the cube to the packaging out of the cube so it would be safe for our baby."
1,Not what I'd call music,"I found this item to be very disappointing. For one thing it's much too large and heavy for a baby to pick up and handle, although it may just be that my baby is too young for this toy at 7 months. The real issue I have with this toy is that the sounds it makes are just horrible. Off key, electrical sounding ""music"" is layered together to create a loud, jumbled, unpleasant sound that makes me want tear my hair out. This is not the learning toy I expected, coming from a family of musicians I'm going to say that this toy offers absolutely nothing for a child's musical development. If you want your child to have a love and understanding of music, listen to classical, jazz or other complex music with them. If you want a toy that will benefit your child musically, give them a xylophone to play with. It's simple and fun, and will always produce a perfect tone."
2,Way too loud!,"My kids (5 and 16 months) both adore this toy and it keeps their attention for a long time. It's also extremely durable, much to my chagrin. Unfortunately it has no volume control and it's so obnoxiously loud that I have to leave the room when they play with it. I also wish it had better sound quality - I'd prefer them to hear real music with real instruments. I plan on smuggling it out of the house when they're not looking."
2,Stupid wires mar otherwise good product,"Shows different musical instruments so baby can experience either each instrument on its own or combined with others. However munchkin did a bad job with packaging using wires to secure box to package. Wires are attached to internal part of cube and not possible to remove. Had to cut, could not pull out so had to push remnant wire into cube. One wire got stuck and may poke my child. Think will throw the cube away as it is a safety hazard."
5,Great gift for infant,I was looking for a gift for my second child that would be her own toy. She is 6 mo. old and I based my buy on the reviews I read here. The reviews weren't wrong. My daughter loves this toy. It is entertaining and pretty indestructible (dropped from highchair and is fine). My daughter is just starting to seat up without support and this toy helps her balance and practice sitting on her own because it is sturdy and just the right size to fit between her legs as she sits. She hits the buttons with her feet and seems excited that that actions makes music. She also sucks on the soft rounded corners. You can't go wrong buying this toy. My 4 yo daughter likes it too!
2,"cool for parents, too advanced for kids","This is a totally cool product...for the parents. By the time the small child this is designed for could possibly appreciate what the toy teaches, he/she would be at least 5-10 years old and by then, the toy still requires patience. This is just a good idea that can't quite reach the audience it hopes too. I still like the toy, but sadly, it's just not for babies. (And I'm a musician with a broad mind for what my little one can understand---this is just too advanced.)Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube"
2,Way too loud,Munchkin Mozart Magic CubeThe older version of this toy had much better songs and in addition to that it's so hard to enjoy playing with this because it's painfully loud. Ridiculously loud.
3,just a little disappointed,"I bought this music cube for my 18 month old granddaughter. I wanted to try it before gifting it.The orchestra button sounds distorted, but the other buttons seem okay. I guess I was just expecting more.I'll see how she likes it come Christmas."
1,Very Disatisfied,"This is actually the second of these I have purchased. The first from another vendor was broken on arrival. This second one from Amazon broke on the third use. The gear strips. For small laminations it might be OK but for 8 by 10 photos it is stressed and breaks. The cheap plastic breaks. Cold sealing is good, but stay away from this product."
1,a disappointing piece of junk,"I received this product with high hopes, based on the other reviews, and was startled to realize it is a piece of junk. They give you sticky plastic pages, which you press together around whatever you want to 'laminate.' The 'laminator' does nothing. Skip this product & buy the sticky paper instead & you'll be fine."
1,Not worth it!,"Although the basic idea of the product is good, the laminator broke on me the very first time I used it. Needless to say I am very disappointed. Thank goodness I was able to save my document."
1,Poor Quality,I just recived my Laminator and on the first use the gears stripped out. We will see how Helpfull Leitz is in replacing it for me.
1,Extremely dissappointed,"I am extremely dissappointed in both this product and the lack of customer service of the manufacturer. When I pulled the laminator of the package, I discovered that the metal parts inside of it are completely rusted. I called the maker of the product, Esselte/Leitz, because the product supposedly came with a 1-year warranty, as stated in the documentation that came with the product. They informed me that they no longer make this product and will not honor the warranty. They told me they couldn't help me and that I should take up my dissatisfaction with Amazon.com. They also informed me that they no longer make the refill pouches to go with it. I noticed this problem popped up in another review, so I find it hard to believe it's an isolated incident."
5,Simply The Best!,"This CD is unbelievable....the incredible voice, the soulful lyrics and beautiful, elegant melodies are very unique...can't wait for Chris Lee's next CD. I've also heard him in person several times and he's definitely a star!"
2,pretty freakin' bad,The only reason this gets more than ONE star is because Elizabeth Mitchell is spellbinding in almost everything i've seen her in - just forward it to the moments she's on screen - well worth the admission!
4,A good old fashioned adventure!,"Disney takes a vein from Indiana Jones in this enjoyable treasure hunt for the BIG ONE. The characters are beautiful taking a page (and artist) from Batman: The Animated Series. Storytelling that keeps us interested while making a subtle comment on the consequences of greed.The only reason I give this a four is because there where elements of the movie that I felt where aimed at the wrong audience. Mainly I'm talking about the disturbing Mole Man put in for comic relief. This character seemed just frightening to me, not cute. Exactly the type of stranger you should keep your kids away from.I think that's where most younger kids get lost while watching Atlantis. The story is more mature and aimed at a slightly older crowd than usual, and it's gritty themes warrant Parental Discretion when viewing.eg. It's fine, but watch it with them the first time at least."
1,"Disney, ¡oh,no! you did it again!","anybody see ""Nadia, the secret of the blue water"" ?, Atlantis is, of course, a copy of this classic japan animation movie, belive me, go to:and decide yourself P.S. My rate is lower than 1 star. ^^"
3,This is Disney?,"I was not impressed AT ALL with this one. The characters were not well drawn, they seemed too ""squarish"". The animation could have been better and the storyline was rather boring. Don't buy this one, rent it and/or tape it off tv. Don't waste your money."
1,Atlantis is the best animated film Ive ever seen,"Im not a disney fan but,if they continue to go in this direction I may end up becoming one. This film was excellent a wonderful piece of Sci Fi fantasy. The story was clever and intelligent nothing wrong with it as far as Im concerved. The characters were interesting and funny in their own right. The end action sequence with the atlantian fighters and bi-planes was well done and reminded me of the star wars space battles. Im familiar with the legend of Atlantis and was impressed by how accurate this movie is. Dont miss it"
1,TERRIBLE!!!!,"This is the most terrible movie Disney has ever made! I(and my daughters) have loved the Disney movies, but even they got bored during the middle of it. For people who want a good movie enjoyable for everyone in the family, go rent ""The Beauty and The Beast""."
1,Shoot me now!,"I thought Disney Studios hit its nadir with ""Pocahontas,"" but I was wrong. ""Atlantis"" is pure drivel. There is nothing charming about the character art, though some of the landscapes are pretty. The characterization of the hero and heroine is strictly by-the-numbers. And I never realized how annoying Michael J. Fox's patter can be until I saw this movie! The sidekick characters, such as they are, are anachronistic stereotypes and just plain unfunny. Ugh. I'm a big fan of Disney animated films, but I won't be adding this one to the collection."
1,Garbage,"The disc I purchased was used but supposidly in good condition. Well turns out it doesn't play past the previews, so you never get to watch the actual movie feature. Because I got it for my kids they never informed me of the problem, rather they just don't watch it. Today months after purchase I tried to play it for them and I found out the hard way it's never worked, now I can't return it, what a waste of money!"
2,Mixed bag...entertaining...but..,"Excellent animation and graphics. Canned feel, like is sometimes said about Disney. Story not great, somebody's imagination went way out. Worth watching once, but not for buying."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"This film was a pleasant surprise for me. The ads on television didn't do the movie justice. It was much better than I expected. Being Michael J. Fox's most recent, and possibly last foray into the big screen, I wanted to see it just for that.The film follows a team trying to find the legendary city of Atlantis, with MJF's character Milo leading them, using an old manuscript that was willed to him. The characterization is wonderful, with a wide variety of personalities, James Garner playing a wonderful role in this.This is a good children's movie, but has good qualities that adults would like as well, such as the humor. There are some good underlying messages in this one too. If you like a lot of the new animated films that have been coming out of Hollywood the last few years, you'll love this one. It's much better than Road to El Dorado and Emperor's New Groove. Your kids will probably like it too."
3,Disney goes under the sea again,"There are two ways to depict Atlantis. The first is how Plato did it- a kindgom on land destroyed by floods. The second is to describe an underwater kingdom, with or without aliens or robots. Disney, of course, chose the second way, without aliens but with robots, or at any rate, mechanical fish.This movie has its moments, to be sure. But it falls short of compelling drama and emotion of past Disney greats. It includes characters that one would prefer not to see, such as the digger. There are also scenes which include giant iron robots and sudden transformations of people to silver that seem to come out of nowhere. At times characterization seems cliched, as when the camp scolds Michael J. Fox for always reading his book, as if the writers need to confirm he is a nerd. Still, Atlantis is funny, and interesting in its own way, a cross between innocent humour and comic book fantasy."
2,I didn't expect that much anyway...,"I felt guilty renting this movie from the get-go. When I watched it I felt quite unfulfilled. The begginning happend too fast really rushing you into the action. The plot was quite thin, and quite the head scratcher. In the audio commentary they producers said they wanted to keep everything mysterious and not give too much of the history of Atlantis away. I thought the history part would be the most interesting, a whole movie about the history would have been better. The animation was okay (yep, the block hands were really odd) and the action was pretty good. But like a lot of Disney's other stuff it was all pretty on the outside but totally empty."
3,"Too hype for little kids, too sweet for adults","Although Disney is good at animation, this movie is a spoof of a 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea versus Beauty & the Beast. The action is ok but limited and somewhat rushed. The relationship between Milo and the Atlantis-Princess is to vague and looks like a one-night stand type of ""relationship"". Good idea, badly developed."
5,Collector's Edition features MANY bonuses,"If you are torn on whether to get Atlantis on VHS, regular DVD or buy this special edition, I'm here to tell you that I highly recommend the bonus stuff for Atlantis. Many ""Special Editions"" leave me wanting more for my money, but this one doesn't."
3,DVD Is Far Better Treatment Than The Actual Movie Deserves.,"When I saw this in theats, I was really looking forward to seeing a Disney movie without any of the characters suddednly bursting out and singing! Well, that was the best part of the whole movie! That and the neat style of animation (although all my friends got a real kick out of the SQUARE FINGERS!)The plot is very original . . . unless, that is, you've seen ""Stargate"". The similarities arew almost endless (the look of the main characters, etc.). Also, if you've seen THAT movie & read the Jules Verne book ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", there is nothing new at all in here.Rating: 2 StarsThe DVD is fantastic, however. Actually, it's kind of like the DVD of ""Snow White"". . . . The DVD's are incredible, but the actual movies [arent] (""Snow White"" more than ""Atlantis"".Rating: 4 StarsOverall: 3 Stars: Worth viewing once, but not buying unless you're an avid DVD collector."
1,Won't play on many DVD players,This DVD won't play on Philips or Magnavox DVD players. I've also heard that it won't play on some other brands of DVD players as well. Don't buy or rent this one if you own a Philips or Magnavox DVD player.
2,blah,If Disney wants to do anime they should hire people who know how to do anime. They gave it a good shot but completely missed their target. I really don't like this mixture of CGI and animation. It should either be all CGI or all animation. Mixing them looks weird and out of place. If you want to see a good movie buy Akira.
1,having the same story frame of a japanese movie,"this is another version of disney's hardwork in copying other's story frame (a 12-year-old japanese movie, translated to english as 'a city in the sky'). very disappointed."
2,"Not much plot, inconsistent animation","This review is for adults -- my children (age 8 and 5) loved this film. I, however, did not particularly care for it. There is not much of a plot and no real character development. But, hey, it's Disney! My real beef is with the animation. It's very strange -- some characters look like classic Disney (think ""101 Dalmatians"") and some look like Japanese anime and one looks like a reject from Saturday morning cartoons. So, very inconsistent animation plus no plot equals...a good opportunity to sit in the air-conditioned dark eating popcorn with your children. Go if you must, but be prepared. It's not as bad as ""Pokemon: The Movie"", but it's close."
4,Good service,"The DVD came quickly, but it was scratched. When I finally got around to watching it, I had to miss part of the movie because it would not play. It did not play after cleaning. I contacted the seller, who reimbursed me for the DVD but not the shipping. I would have been more impressed if he would have reimbursed me fully, since the DVD is not completely watchable. Overall, good service but not great."
3,fun viewing,"The characters in this film are drawn similarly to those in 101 Dalmations or Sword in the Sword...so in a way retro and in another way somewhat simplistic. The submarine and computer graphics are awesome. I found the film in general rawther entertaining and was glad to find no talking animals or teacups and unnecessary, bland songs interspersed (if you have songs, make them not all the warbling, silky sort that grates my nerves. Shrek is more on track songwise). All in all, a fine adventure animated flick!"
3,"Historically Accurate, Family Fun!","I did not get to see this one in the theatre, but I wish I had! This is one of Disney's best in quite a while. The story is based somewhat on Leonard Nimoy's (the Atlantean King) research on Atlantis which was documented on The History Channel. My daughter(15) and I enjoyed it immensely. Michael J Fox is one of the greatest personification actors I've ever known (Chance, Homeward Bound I and II). James Garner's voice was a welcome surprise, and having Leonard Nimoy in the movie as well is fantastic. Parents should watch with their children, there is some violence toward the end. My only complaint is in the rendition of some of the characters. The fingernails are square (my daughter says that ears and fingernails are the bane of animators), and the grossly pronounced lips on the Black and Hispanic characters. All in all, it's great family fun!"
5,Wonderful adaptation,"Excellent adaptation of Oscar Wilde's novel. Not only an excellent reminder that you can hide what you are from others but never from yourself, but also that no matter how foul the life, redemption is still there for all who sincerely wish it. God stands with open arms for the pure AND the unpure who come to Him.GREAT movie!"
5,Christmas gift,I purchased this as a gift for my daughter to use in her English class when her students read the book.
1,"Another ""Sales People Rule"" and ""Everyone Else is Mud"" book","I cannot recommend this book. I was lucky enough not to have to buy my own copy and after reading it I could not imagine why anyone would pay for it. The advice is very sophomorish. If anything, it makes a sales guy feel good about being a sales guy by putting down the people who produce the things the sales man sells: a very unenlightened view of sales to say the least. Don't waste your money."
3,Not Thrilled,"This video moves at a very, very, slow pace. I understand the need for repetition, but the pace does not hold my child's attention...it just seemed to drag on and on."
1,Spend your money else where,This video will teach you just about 8 signs... that's it! Better off googling the basic signs if that's all you're looking for.
5,A really great gift,"I was utterly delighted to receive this myself a few years ago. It's such a personal gift, well made and useful too.I have now given it to two friends and it's such fun to find a theme of photos to suit them. I highly recommend it."
3,"ecclectic, low budget, wholehearted","I'm just responding to the guy who thought he was clever by saying that ""they couldn't afford a vocal processor...""Apparently you've never heard of an artist named Donovan, although you parents surely have. The vocal styling on the song ""You Are My Son"" is a tribute to Donovan's vocal style, and actually as original and courageous as a tribute gets."
4,Mysteriously Irresistable,"I wanted to dislike this book immediately because the plot is somewhat ""unlikely"", but I found this an incredibly entertaining book that delivers a fun and easy read, and I just could not put it down. I can't say it is a great book, in the sense that it speaks to me on some spiritual or otherwise un-carnal level (I found the attempts the author made at handling grief and spirituality very unsophisticated and stereotypical, and therefore distracting), but if you go into it expecting something fun and mostly mindless, you get everything you wanted and more out of it! As I said, even with all my reservations, I just could not put it down, and that is always a good sign! As a footnote, there is quite a bit of sex in this book, so if that sort of thing makes you uncomfortable, this book may not be for you."
1,CHEAP,"I am very unhappy with this product. The stools are very cheaply made and unsturdy. The backrest hits the back in an odd place, making it uncomfortable. We also weren't sent any instructions for the assembly of the stools. After much trouble, we figured it out. On the 2nd stool, however, the alignment was off, and the seat wouldn't assemble correctly.And, to top it all off, the company doesn't argued with me about return the item, doesn't sent a return authorization label (you're responsible for it), and is CHARGING ME A 20% RESTOCKING FEE. Think twice about purchasing from this company online!!!"
3,Black Swivel Chair,"This item was one screw short. We were able to purchase that screw for just a few cents. Overall, we were happy with the item."
4,exceeded expectations,"You get two chairs, very inexpensive. Not too difficult to assemble, like the fact that they are metal. They swivel very nicely, look great with my black granite countertop and dark brown tile floor. Are just the right height for sitting by the countertop. Would definitely recommend. Could be somewhat heavier metal, but then the price would increase."
1,Fool for the stool,Beautiful? just the opposite. I have so many left over pieces since your designing of the stool is horrible. Do you want them?
1,NOT Compatable with iPod photo!,"My 40gb iPod photo DOES NOT FIT in the dock. Altec Lansing tech support claims by removing the installed adapter it will fit, but in fact IT DOES NOT... Altec Lansing also claims that the iM3c is compatable with the iPod photo. Amazon apparently does not carry the iM3c only the iM3...DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE AN iPod Photo!!!!"
2,Compact but otherwise basic and unimpressive...,"I received this as a Christmas gift and while it's compact, there are a couple of major flaws. The power button is the only thing on the remote that works. None of the other controls on the remote work. Second, it's VERY BASIC. I would have preferred something that had some ""sleep"" or auto shut off mechanism that could be set using the remote control. The only positive comments I have about this are that it's compact and looks tidy on a desk or shelf, and it charges the iPOD really quickly when it's docked. Otherwise, the sound is mediocre and the controls suck."
1,Too many fatal errors!,"The LSAT doesn't give you points if you mark the wrong answer, no matter how good your intentions. So why should you forgive the editors of this book who misspell and misuse words in almost every section including the practice tests? I wasted several hours giving REA the benefit of the doubt, but the fact is that this book was slapped together too hastily to give you solid grounding for the test."
2,Terrible sequel,"I bought this because it was the sequel to ""Cast a Deady Spell"", which is a brilliant horror/comedy built on themes from H.P. Lovecrafts Cthulhu mythos. ""Witch Hunt"" loses everything that was great about ""Cast a Deadly Spell"", with trivial exceptions like the business card gag. The noir mood and gritty setting is lost completely. Deadly Spell was cool, intelligent and fun, Witch Hunt is campy, heartless and plastic. Nothing about the story really works well when it tries to tie in to the past movie, and it's very disappointing when detective Lovecraft ends up being a magic user by the end of the film. It's a soulless zombie feeding on the corpse of the first movie, and that metaphor is way cooler than anything else about the film itself. If you loved the original movie because of all the H.P. Lovecraft and Cthulhu stuff, you can just go ahead and skip this film, because whoever wrote the script didn't get it."
4,Good for Beginners,"This book is helpful for people new to their jobs. If you don't have anyone who can give you good advice, try this book and you will gain understanding and wisdom about how you should act in your workfield."
3,OK followup,"I really enjoyed the first book. This story was entertaining, but had some slow parts which overall dragged the book. For some reason, I did not connect with Mark Twain as much as I did with Francis Burton. Again, it was obvious that this writing was dated, but again, I cannot hold it against the author since it was written in the 60s."
3,To journey up the great River,"In this, the second of The Riverworld series, Samuel Clemens, joined by Viking, Erik Bloodaxe undertake to find a source of iron great enough to build a Riverboat by which to navigate to the headwaters of the Riverworld and there to asertain the purpose for which they were all resurected.The Stranger who has helped various individuals along with information in the first book continues to help, and lends his assistance in delivering an enormous supply of iron in reach of Clemens's team. Undertaking thier great project, the newfounded city faces trials from within and without. Neighboring city-states want to take over the source of iron for themselves, and Samuel Clemens must think quick to avoid trechery, even comiting trechery of his own to achive his goals.Not as great as the first book, and it draggs a bit, but still enjoyable."
4,fairly enjoyable pulp,"not much more to say. It's pulp, but good enjoyable stuff.Books 1 and 2 are vastly superior because, not despite this. Their origins in the serial magazine world show and are delightful.Books 3,4,5 suffer because PJF tends to believe he is a far far better writer than he is, and overwrite if not severely edited"
1,suck fest,after the first book I was suspecting a lot more. It got to the point where I was just skipping pages to finish. The 3rd book was a little better but not much.
3,Not as compelling as _To Your Scattered Bodies Go_,"In the second book of the Riverworld series, Sam Clemens aka Mark Twain has a single dream: build a majestic Riverboat to sail to the headwaters of the mighty river and find the ones responsible for Resurrection. Although the story is first rate, I found the pacing mediocre. Clemens is given a revelation from a ""Mysterious Stranger"" at the very beginning of the book, and nothing more is forthcoming; I found that this early climax robbed the rest of the book of some of its punch. Also, toward the end, there are two major time-shifts which are totally out of place. But the rest is quite enjoyable."
3,Sifu John Michael Vincent Hanson's Review,"I am writing this review as a senior student of Master Zhang Luping and one who has urged the author to set forth the ideas and theories of Master Zhang Luping. See more at www.taichijohn.comAlthough Luping had always encouraged to see beyond his own teachings, I feel that the book only provides some hints of Luping's teachings for the common reader. Doing tai chi is like walking through mud. It can be messy but that's where the gold is. I want to see a nice big muddy footprint of Luping's.Huan Zhang has done a great job illustrating the Yang essential principles through imaginative storytelling.Good luck.Yang Style Tai Chi Chuan - Long Form : Unleash the Power Within"
2,needle too large,"The gauge of this needle is way too large to apply weld-on 3 with precision. Even without pressing the applicator bottle, gravity will cause the solvent to pour out of the needle making it very difficult to apply with precision."
2,not a book for the kindle,This may be a good book but its not a good one for the kindle. With a book like this I don't really want to read it cover to cover. I like to flip though it and find the places that interest me. With the kindle format you can't really do that. I wish I had bought the paper version.
5,Phenomenal immune system booster,"About 15 years ago, I was developing a cold - and had to find something to stop it, because I had a long flight in a couple of days and knew nasal congestion could be dangerous - all that pressure on the eardrums at high altitude.So, went to a health foods store. ARA-Larix was the product they recommended. Said it was far superior to echenacea and golden seal root, which I was planning to buy. What it did was eliminate all traces of my cold. I've been using it ever since. I recommend it highly. The health food store woman said she'd checked with her doctor, who told her she could take it daily and it wouldn't build up dangerously in her system, as would some other products. In addition to ""an apple a day"" - I would recommend ARA-Larix, as well."
4,Useful information for professionals or do it yourself-ers,"For those who want information in a user-friendly format, this DVD is a wonderful way to see a pondless waterfall project from start to finish. It gives the viewer the option of learning the steps to building a waterfall in a way that can be reviewed as necessary. Karen Christanell"
3,ok but not great,"Not bad but felt a bit soggy and salty, I had better ones in the past, maybe it was over heated. at any rate I would not recommend it."
3,mundanetraveler,"Moontraveler is a solid debut album that deserves at least three stars. The songwriting can get a little confusing when it comes to trying to understand where Aaron is coming from on a couple of the songs. He still manages to come across with a honest sound though. If you are a big Aaron Sprinkle fan then you will most likely enjoy this album, but if you are not then you might want to just get his most recent release ""Bareface."""
3,I dont know if I would buy this,"I love Champion. Dont get me wrong in any of this.This DVD/CD is just not listen-able. The quality for audio just cant get me into it. I was hoping for better quality, and its quiet a shame. Its neat to own because it is their last show and it has a few neat clips from the band talking. But the show is just not something I enjoy listening to. The vocals are non existant, and super compressed. The music is lackluster in the recordings. For a band that was so powerful, it makes them look sloppy. Sorry, I guess I was just hoping for more."
3,"Not bad, but...","After trying out ""Inner Sanctuary"" (also by Sandy Mc Dermott) and really liking it, I was eager to buy and listen to ""Deep Relaxation"". I was a little disappointed, however. Sandy's voice is still quite soothing, but it almost feels as if she was less comfortable with it than with ""Inner Sanctuary"". One of the thing I loved about the latter was also the guided imagery section, which I still think is one of the most relaxing out there (and I have bought quite a lot of such CDs). Of course, if you prefer breathing-focused relaxation and are not a fan of guided imagery, then ""Deep Relaxation"" might be a better choice for you."
2,Not happy with this product,"I am female and I travel a long distance to work everyday andI thought it would be great to use whenever I am stuck intraffic. Well, I tried it yesterday and I was notable to get it unfolded enough and I was never able toget any urine in the bag. Needless to say I was smartenough to put plastic on my car seat, because I definitelywet my pants. As confused as I was the first time, I hadto go again while still stuck in traffic, so I tried anotherbag and once again I got wet all over. I guess it requirespractice, but I am not a fan at this time."
5,Life Saver with Potty Training!!,I am SO glad I came across these! While finishing up potty training with my 3yr old these became a serious life saver! They saved us on a 14hr road trip (I have to pee! during a traffic jam on a bridge!) and were great to use when we just left a store during bad weather and someone decided they needed to go. They really are invaluable and also great for those summer trips to the beach. I cannot recommend these enough and totally love them!
4,Outstanding narrative of Western European socialism.,"The author peforms an admirable job of condensing 100 years of Western European socialist history into a readable narrative. He describes the conditions that led to the triumph and then the fall of socialist movements in Europe. The author fails in his attempts at refuting the intellectual attacks on socialism levied by Mises, Hayek, and others, dismissing them as reactionary hacks rather than addressing the validity of their arguements. As socialism becomes even more untenable in a global economy, the author's work reads like an epitaph for a dead ideology advanced by a dying political movement."
4,EXCITING STUFF,"this is actually the first episode of Sharpe's that i've ever seen, and i found it lots of fun, filled with action and Sean Bean. The production quality is great. The casting is very good as well, especially in Sharpe's company. Must admit that i came to this series as a fan of Mr. Bean, and am in no way disappointed."
2,"Nice looking, but looks don't match quality","The actual product is too small to fit the bed size. We bought a king size, and ended up using it on a full size bed which it fits perfectly.In addition all the down has shifted (even though the description says box stitching), in actuality the stitching doesn't seem to go all the way to the edges, so all the down shifts to one end of the comforter.But on the plus side it does look nice, so it's on our guest bed."
3,Do not leave in the sun,"I thought this was the cutest outdoor statue, but having it for a while and it being out in the sun, it has faded so much. The little boy is practically white and the dog is a light beige. I would recommend it if you kept it out of the sun."
3,A little hard to follow the timeline,I liked it okay but read it over quite a long period of time. A completely different culture then what I am familiar with and that might have been part of the reason for not always having it hang together for me.
2,Dislike this book,"The artwork is wonderful, it's colourful and attractive, it's too bad the story is repetitive in a non-positive way and boring for the most part. The grouchy lady bug is not a sympathetic character at all, and not one that I would want my children mimicking."
5,Grouchy Ladybug,"My granddaughter ""fell in love"" with this book and she ""had"" to have a copy and where else but Amazon? Wonderful service every time I have done business with Amazon. Products top drawer. Thank you all so much.Howard"
5,Good Book,This is one of my all time favorites by Eric Carle. We even made it into a puppet show! Fun
1,Worst Book for Children!,"I'm really not sure how this book made it to publishing, there is no ""lesson learned"" in it other that being grumpy and wanting to fight - for no reason. I made the mistake of reading this to my 3 year old without pre-reading it first. It is curently in a recycle heap in our county."
1,not nice,"I typically like Eric Carle books, but I wish I'd never heard of this one. This was on my 6 year old daughter's summer reading list for first grade. The ladybug goes around to each animal wanting to fight. Maybe we're naive but I want to keep the innocence going in our family as long as possible. It's just NOT NICE and it doesn't really seem to teach a good lesson. I'd skip this one and buy one of his other books."
1,terrible book from an otherwise wonderful illustrator,"why does eric carle have to make some of his characters so unappealing? what kid or parent would want to read a story about a total grouch who goes around the world being a pain in the neck? to me, this book and the very busy spider, who is an antisocial workaholic with no time for her neighbors, set really bad examples of behavior. why should i waste my time or my son's reading about characters i don't like? save your money for his better books--the chameleon, the polar bear, the kangaroo, the caterpillar, etc."
5,Mermaid,I love stories that are based on true events and show the real charactors at the end. The movie is very touching but also shows there is a God who knows the hearts of children and cares about their understanding of Him and that He hears and answers prayers. My grandson who just turned 5yrs. old watched it with me and when his daddy came home from work he told the whole story with excitement! Thankyou for making it available.
5,A Roadmap for the living of life...,"John does a great job with this work..He takes the life of David, from a boy to an old man and cites the changes his life goes through as a backdrop for the changes all humans go through as we move from childhood to adolesence, to maturity and then to old age. John accomplished his purpose--to provide a roadmap, signposts if you will,for the living of life, stage to stageto stage. From Womb to Tomb. Good growth book for parents and all middle agers..."
5,Great customer service,This company has great and fast customer service. The DVD arrived extremely fast. They definitely take care of their customers.
4,bought it for my granddaughter,I bought it for my granddaughter who loves elephants. She watches it over and over. She loves this movie. It was in perfect condition when it arrived and I received it very quickly. Very pleased.
2,"Yeah I Know It's a Classic, BUT.....","I hate this movie. I just bought it cause it was on sale and I'm slowly building my Disney DVD Collection. It was boring, and sad, and the whole pink elephant scene scared the hell out me. What the hell was in that water? Some funny type of acid trip. Anyway, I know it's a classic, so whatever. But I will never watch it again. I'll just keep the movie for show. I wonder why I've never seen it as a kid, it was more like a horror flick."
2,Great movie if it weren't for the Pink Elephants,"Don't get me wrong... I am one of those life-long Disney movie lovers; the kind that collect every one of the movies for my children....BUT, Dumbo is just not at the top of the list when it comes to letting my 3-year-old watch it. Both my husband and I recall being frightened by the ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" as young children---you must admit the worms and skeletal elephants are a little weird. The rest of the movie is wonderful--the characters, songs, moral and story---but THAT part just doesn't seem to fit in with the rest, and unfortunately, causes us to shy away from adding Dumbo to our Disney collection."
5,Dumbo VHS movie,I was very pleased that I received the video so quickly. It was shrink-wrapped and in perfect condition. Great service! Thanks so much.
5,dumbo is a classic,"thank you for bringing Dumbo back, like the older classics, they are more cleaner than most, at least disney can put out clean, and not so vulgar movies like others, thank you to Disney for having great movies, and bringing back the classicsas a child i loved Dumbo, Mickey,Cinderella, snow white, and more, it brings back a smile to my face, whoever said this movies was made by the black people, so what if they did, at least they were not afraid to work like some people. it does not matter what color you are and what we do, leave the commets to yourselves. I say bring back Dumbo"
3,you have to be a devoted Pharaoh fan to give $... for this,"i liked cleopatra but i was kinda disappointed with it. First the only thing that is really different then Pharaoh is that there are a couple more buildings. I didnt really like the new missions because they are a lot harder than in Pharaoh and some of them have a time limit! All in all i guess it was a worthy of the title of Official Pharaoh Expansion Pack. I am also looking forward to the new one, ""Zeus...."", whenever it comes out."
5,Strong Black Woman,"Angela Patrick Wynn took the life of a single black woman and showed us all the ups and downs of what it takes to make it. Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down. The fact that Renea was willing to change her plans to be there for her younger brother, showed her love and devotion to him. Once she made that decision, God put her in the path of people who could help her accomplish her goal. Angela Patrick Wynn, I thank you for sharing your story and I look forward to reading your next book."
1,Not what I expected,"I only bought this item because it was suggested on a blog as an alternative to hair color without chemicals. I used it and nothing happened. So yea, I was disappointed - oh well."
2,"NOT POCKET SIZE, but great dictionary","This is a fine dictionary. Clear, easy to read, but unlike the advertising it is not a ""pocket"" dictionary. I don't own a pocket that could fit that thing."
5,Amazing,"When I first heard this CD, I was surprised in many ways. First, Shiny Beast is less bluesy than Beefheart's other records. Second, the atmosphere of some of the songs differs completely from anything I had heard from this man. And third, this is one of the best albums I have ever heard in my life.Many of the songs on this album are very accessible, but the apparent simplicity is deceptive. As usual, Captain Beefheart is strong on arrangements. My absolute favorite in this respect is the title track. There are some sounds on this song that made me think ""how the hell did he do that?"". Candle Mambo is one of these songs that really surprised me when I thought I was getting to know the man. But Beefheart can be predictible as well: a Beefheart album always contains one or two nice instrumental songs, and Bat Chain Puller is no exception. Ice Rose really is a little jewel.A must for any Beefheart fan."
2,Not so Sure,"I bought about 7 cases of this stuff for my mother, who had cervical cancer. She stayed on it for 120 days. she died 6 months later, so I am not sure if it really worked for her. I still have about 12 bottles left."
3,talkabout t7400 (yellow Ni-MH),"These radios are overall good quality ( but not as good as the old t6220's). The first day that I had them one of the latches onthe belt clip broke. I called up the help line and got a new one(seven days later i might add) only to see that this one was smaller and thiner than the one that came with the radios- this tells me that they (the company) fixed the issue of the belt clip, it works better despite the fact that the teeth on the radio are too small and the radio fall off. The box says that the unites are ""field cirtified"" (6 miles over open land). I feel that these radios are too big for the range and too big for the shortage of Wattage ( watts is what gets your signel herd over long distances and perced through most obsrtuctions people). I feel thay should buy these radios if you are just want an introduction unite and don't want to spend alot of money."
4,Pretty good,These are a lot better than regular battery-operated lights. The only thing is that they give off a blueish color instead of white.
4,Great Rhythm,"I find the music of this cd to be an excellent source of rhythm, which motivates me to dance and excercise each day."
4,Watch it Buyers,"This is figure is great no kinding, but well he doesn't have many moving parts. He's hard to put in cool poses for display. Also he is really hard to stand up striaght. And the final his left hand isn't in a fist so when his claws/knives are out it looks a little stupid. Okay now for the GOOD stuff. Well the figure looks awesome and his right hand is great for poses. His legs are stiff but have great bending and twisting actions. I have seen all the figures in stores and I think that this is the BEST head/facial expression of any of the Logan/Wolverine figures. He looks just like him!"
1,Ugly marketing,"Funny thing that I have found this same sentence ""The picture is not to be believed. HDTV at its best. DVD viewing sensational. I am impressed. "" in many reviews.I think that the Samsung marketing guys are working hard tryng to impress us."
4,A Disc of Pure Delight,"My sentiments parallel those of the reviewers who have come before me. These are wonderful renditions of various anthems and ""fuging tunes"" of the early American composer. I suppose inclusion of Chester would have made it perfect, but you can't have everything. The performance of Africa, my favorite Billings piece, is utterly magnificent, as is I Am the Rose of Sharon and all the others. If you're going to purchase any Billings discs, you need to start with this one. Absolutely."
3,Deja vu,"I had the feeling I've read this book before. And in a way I have, because it recycles much of Eric Drexler's book, ""Engines of Creation,"" from nearly 20 years ago, even copying Drexler's condescending way of explaining basic scientific and technological concepts. It would have made more sense for Hall to publish an updated edition of ""Engines"" and list himself as a co-author, instead of writing a largely derivative book of his own. He could still have put in a chapter about his ""invention"" of Utility Fog, yet another example of nanotech vaporware that many of us long-time ""Transhumanists"" probably won't live long enough to see. I didn't feel I got my money's worth, so borrow it from the library before you decide whether to buy it."
5,Shinto Religion: A Japanese Treasure of Tradition,"I thought that the book was great, I learned so much and I was glad that I was able to read it. My friend owns it and soon I will buy it... Probably today or tommorow. Shinto is my religion and I am eager to learn more about it. As much as possible."
2,OUTDATED,This book seemed great at first but the more involved i got in my search for the right school the more i realized how outdated and limited it is. Many phone numbers and alot of the information is old and it barely scratches the surface of all the schools out there.
2,"Boring, Plodding, and Tiresome","I usually can read a 500 page novel in about 4 days. Jerlayne took me over 2 weeks - and I really pushed myself to finish!This book had very little explaination about how/why certain things were happening. I felt like I was reading the second book in a series the entire time. The characters were totally uninteresting - even the title character Jerlayne was a bore. I had no sympathy to anyone in this book because they were 2-dimentional sadsacks. I would have liked to read more about the relationships between the characters instead of being told ""they loved each other."" I wish we would have been shown more than told.If you like books that are about having children and housework, by all means, read Jerlayne.If you like books that have a smooth plot, interesting/believable relationships, and intelligence please, read something else."
1,PAPER TOO THIN TO WRITE ON. BLEEDS THROUGH.,"I wanted a Bible whereby, I could make notes in the margins. The paper was extremely thin and unusable for notes. Aslo, the size of the bible was too large for a standard Bible zipper case cover. The leather was not soft and pliable and would crease over extended use."
5,Good but no way of knowing until my wife gets pregnant.,We had a miscarriage. So now we trying everything we can to increase the strength of the uterine walls. We won't kno if it helped until we get pregnant again. Will repost when it happens.
5,Love the tea - just use a STRAW to avoid tooth staining,"Not sure if this is what sped up my 3rd birth, but I drank 3-4 cups a day steeped for 20 min each about 1 1/2 weeks beforehand and then I steeped about 10 tea bags for 30 min and drank it when I got to the hospital. I had less than a 5 hour labor and 5 min of pushing. The only thing I wasn't paying attention to was my teeth because I was so focused on an easy labor. Within a week, my teeth had stained so much! So, make sure you rinse well and consider a straw if you steep it as much as I did."
1,Buyer Beware! Anti-Piracy Protection on this CD,I purchased this CD for my daughter and I as we are both fans of K.T. The issue that I encountered was with the 'anti-piracy' protection on this CD. Since I use my computer to store and organize all of my music I attempted to burn the CD to my library as I do with all CDs I purchase. The problem was that my computer was unable to recognize the disc; even with the latest driver software for the DVD player in my computer. I simply want to inform others of potential problems with this CD and allow you to make a more informed purchasing decision than I was able to make. In order to be fair this CD plays fine in a standard CD drive. The only potential problem appears to be with computer CD/DVD drives.
5,Worthing buying !! Do not think twice,"SO many artists out there come out with albums that have one our two songs that sound semi interesting and with time you force yourself into likeing the album ! Force is not the case with KT's album ""Eye to the Telescope"" .. I heard ""Other side of the World"" while shopping for a fine read at B&N .. and before i knew it i needed to own the album !! so i walked out with the CD ,, (overpriced at B&N of course) and have not regreted buying it at all .. the Whole album flows softly and the vocals are awesome !! NO tricks and loud music masking the pure vioce ,, lets just say this is NOT Ashley Simpson !!! ""Heal over"" is addictive .. so warning !!! have a mature approach and know when to stop listening to that song over and over !! I can go on and on .. but i will not and let the audiance judge for itself !GREAT ALBUM .. Flawless from the first track to the last ! i look forward to her coming to San Diego which i doubt will happen anytime soon"
4,Love Her,"I haven't bought a CD for myself in years, but I heard an interview on NPR with K.T. Tunstall and ordered this CD the same day. I am entranced with her voice, love her lyrics and am especially amazed by her ability to re-create her songs live. I have bought copies for several friends as birthday gifts and told everyone I know about her. In my opinion, you won't regret giving K.T. Tunstall a try."
4,Haunting Vocals + Great Acoustics = SMASH DEBUT.,"I was watching VH1 the other night and i came across KT TUNSTALL, with her debut single "" Suddenly i see"". I was hooked on to her. She carried her self so well , her playing , her singing is my gosh a great welcome. On the lines of Nelly Furtado , Alanis Morissete , Jewel , Vanessa Carlton , and Norah Jones her music speaks out loud.I picked up the album "" Eye to the telescop"" and every song is worth a listen. Most of them are radio friendly and definitly single potentials.GREAT MUSIC PEOPLE. KT TUNSTALL , the new acoustic rock princess is here !!."
5,As much as I don't appreciate double-dipping...,"Natasha Bedingfield...Anna Nalick...Shakira...now KT Tunstall. What's with all these female artists re-releasing new versions of their albums shortly after the original is released and making fans buy it again? Is George Lucas now in control of the music industry too? Geez.But having said that, this new version of Eye to the Telescope is absolutely 100% worth getting, yes, even if you already bought it before. Whereas the new re-issued albums from the aforementioned artists only contain different versions of songs and/or perhaps a bonus track/demo, the bonus DVD here is worth the price of admission. 5 live songs from KT Tunstall and all of her music videos. Doesn't get any better than that. And the bonus track ""Immune"" is definitely worth a listen.I would normally encourage folks to avoid these blatant cash-in attempts of album re-issues, but with KT Tunstall I'll make an exception. Final verdict: 0 stars for corporate greed, 5 stars for KT Tunstall."
3,Pretty good.,"I like the album, but I was disappointed when I recieved the cd. I ordered this album instead of purchasing it from a store because it had a live version of Black Horse & the Cherry Tree, but I didn't have the live version. I am usually pleased with the delivery service by ImportCDs, but not this time."
5,Eye to the Telescope short and sweet Review,"Briliant album, it might sound like a bit country but that makes this amazing. KT Tunstell has an amazing voice and the music is amazing to listen to. The album has a nice accoustic sound to it. The album is brilliant to listen to it, a must buy for any proper music fan this is a must buy."
4,Solid debut for a wee girl,"""Eye"" is a solid, but not stellar, debut for KT Tunstall. The songwriting is sharp, and several of the songs contain great hooks. The production leaves a bit to be desired; the drum loops leave the impression someone was trying hard to make the disc sound ""hip"". If you can imagine the irresistible ""Black Horse"" played in front of a real rock and roll band instead of a drum loop, then you get the picture.Still, KT displays both good songwriting and singing chops; I look forward to hearing her sophmore release. If you enjoy your singer/songwriter fare served up with a healthy dash of rock and roll, then you will enjoy ""Eye"".Recommended."
1,Maybe My Frio Was Defective But . . .,"The first time I used the Frio cooling wallet my insulin was cool but not as cool as advertising for the product claimed. The second time I used the wallet, it not only did not keep my insulin cool but the wallet oozed slime when I soaked the wallet as instructed. What felt like crystals inside the wallet seemed to be disintegrating when wet. Doubt that I would ever purchase another produce from Frio. Wrote to the manufacturer and heard nothing back from them."
3,Watch the temperature,I bought this item for travel storage of an injectable for rheumatoid arthritis. I found the case didn't get below 65 deg in temp which is ok for a few hours but be careful of temperature for longer storage.
4,Good relaxing cup of tea.,"I am a fan of Yogi Teas to start. This tea is just the right combination of mint, herbs and sweetness. I like mine with a half teaspoon of honey. I have heard that other mothers religious drank this tea and had easier labors and deliveries. We'll see if it works for me."
3,Delicious for a RRL Tea!,"This tea is quite tasty! I didn't mind drinking it multiple times a day. I started drinking this tea as soon as I reached 3rd trimester in my pregnancy (even though it is safe all througout pregnancy). Toward the end I was drinking 3+ cups a day. It is hard to say if it did any good. I was in labor for 80 hours with my son, which resulted in a c-section... but that was due to him being in a poor position. I don't think it did any harm by any means and I will drink it again when I get pregnant again."
5,Great Tea,"I have been drinking Yogi tea since my first trimester. Now that I'm in my 3rd and ready to deliver I have upped my consumption to 2-3 cups a day with two tea bag in each cup, I actually bought a case from Amazon. I am birthing at a natural birthing center and all the doulas and midwives encourage the drinking of raspberry leaf, which is in the Woman's Mother To Be Tea. Its a very calming tea and I enjoy it with a squeeze of lemon and agave nectar."
2,Irritating,"The eyeliner looks good but after awhile it starts irritating my eyes. They start feeling itchy esp. around the lashes and i feel that I have to scratch them all the time, which makes them look all smudged. I can't understand why because it is supposed to be ecofriendly and non-irritating, but i guess there's something in it that is causing an irritation, organic or not."
4,Double Murder on the Maine Coast,"Summer in Maine with all the delights of coastal living, spiced up by two murders involving visitors, artists, and native Mainers who worry about the invasion of people from ""away."" Humor, action, and well rounded characters add to the reading pleasure."
2,"Six pages, seven characters and one dog - start taking notes","The beginning of the book literally gave me a headache. In six pages, you are introduced to no less than seven characters (and a dog) with very little background. Sort of like walking into a room of strangers, being given their names over the course of a few minutes and later asked to remember who they are.The book finally levels out and turns out to be a decent mystery, but the rocky start stayed with me."
3,We love it.,"This book took longer than I hoped to arrive, but it is in great condition and we love it."
3,What you see is not what you get...,"Did not receive the Caribbean colors shown in the picture. Received ""80s"" collection colors which is who knows how old."
3,Finger Sleeves,"The sleeves are ok, but does not last long and are not as good as the Nike Finger Sleeves."
3,Finger sleeves,"The weight & length are ok, even though I have short stubby fingers. They provide moderate-to-good protection for my arthritic knuckles. My main concern is that they show wear & tear on the fabric after the first wear. I expected to be able to wash them & keep them looking good for multiple wears.Are these sold in stores anywhere or strictly by mail order? I probably will purchase again."
3,too tight,I wish I had thought about this product more...I don't really need all the different sizes....good to keep on hand though for any other finger injuries
4,a bit runnier than I expected,"This is not the type of glue I was expecting, its basically water thin.It does work well though, just hard to get it exactly where you need it."
5,Terrific,This is absolutely the best freezer wrap I have used. It conforms to the item and eliminates air pockets. There is no freezer burn!
1,"Good book, don't buy the kindle version","The Kindle version of this book is so badly formatted that it's virtually impossible to read. Until they fix the formatting issues, I recommend buying an actual copy of the book. Very poor job."
1,"Boring , full of useless facts","This books is just a laundry list of completely useless facts. One gets no personal insight into the individual. Note to self, never buy a biography, always read autobiographies. The difference is amazing. A person writing about their own life is infinitely more useful than an outsider writing about his interpretation of that person's life."
3,For experts only,"Although I consider myself to be a sophisticated musical listener, this CD was beyond my abilityto appreciate it. Most of the CD consists of chants with a minority of the CD being Lassus' polyphonic music. It is abstruse and requires great patience. The performance is excellent."
5,A Must Read,"I'm not one to write reviews, however, this book is exceptional. I have paid off my car, $15k in credit cards, raised my fico my 100 points, and bought a house in the last two years. Conservatively, I should have my house paid off in less than 10 years. I have bought this book for friends and family. I pick up this book and re-read it every six months or so for some new motivation. It's not always easy making some sacrifices, but my peace of mind is SO worth it."
2,Too predictable,Certainly a let down from previous books. The plot is boring and the conclusion was predictable from chapter one. Recommend skipping this book and you will not need an alibi to do it.
3,More Romance than Mystery,"This is my first Sandra Brown novel and although it was a good read, therre was just waaaay too much romance for me. Characters were ok, a little bit one-dimensional, but still likable.All in all, if you just need a book to take to the beach, this would keep you occupied for an hour or two."
2,Potentially good story,"If Sandra Brown were a beginning writer, I would be much more understanding of the shortcomings in her writing technique. In The Alibi, she doesn't seem to have listened to her editor - or worse, her editor wasn't paying enough attention. The story itself has a great deal of potential, but the characters are flat, the dialogues stilted, descriptions inconsistent and the repetitions in vocabulary very very annoying. There is nothing more irritating than being told the obvious: that someone is acting hysterically because he or she is hysterical, for example. She and her editors would do well to re-read some of the truly great tight thriller writers."
1,"boring, boring, boring",I have about 25 pages left to read of The Alibi. This is the most boring book written by Sandra Brown that I have read! (I have read all her books)!! Please write more books like Fat Tuesday and Unspeakable.
4,Consider this!!!,"Hello to all those that may read this review. The album itself is a fine one, but my favorite song is track #9 - ""Why I love you - you are my joy"". This is a beautiful worship song to the Lord. This song was used to start the first dance (with my wife) at our wedding. What a beautiful song to share with your wife. I never heard a song so powerful for that occasion. God bless you Kenoly Brothers...."
1,Extremely disappointing,"As an equine massage therapist, I am always looking for relevant information which will help me be a better therapist and help my clients more proficiently. Even though I am a licensed massage therapist and a registered massage therapy instructor, I do not automatically believe that because something is labeled alternative or complementary that it is always good, or effective, or even non-injurious. However, I try to keep an open mind, which is what this author has failed to do. Virtually every summary for the alternative therapy which has been discussed ends with (paraphrasing) ""there is no scientific proof that this treatment is effective in either humans or animals."" The author is obviously so biased against any non-traditional medical treatments that I consider this book of absolutely no value. In fact, I plan on returning it."
2,"Too Much ""Neigh""-Saying","All those glowing reviews convinced me this was a worthwhile book, but I was sorely disappointed. This is not a guide because it doesn't provide any guidance. I might have understood if the authors were skeptical about some of the therapies, but they have nothing positive to say about any of the many possible alternative therapies from acupuncture to herbals. None seems to have enough scientific evidence to convince them. They criticize all. The obvious conclusion is not to do anything except follow current, conventional veterinary approaches. It makes you wonder whose interests these writers are trying to protect."
1,"""Debunking Alternative Therapies""","This book is a little bit like reading an Air Force report on Roswell, or a CIA report on the Kennedy assasinations. Can you say ""vested interest"", or self serving?"
5,"Great product, exactly what I was looking for","If you need to replace the blade for you andis outliner II clipper then this is exactly what you need. Assembly is a piece of cake, simple use a phillips head screwdriver to remove the old blade and then pop the new one right in. I only wish that some clipper oil could have been included with the blade, but overall an excellent product."
1,Manufacturing Issues!!!! Defect in Glass.,"Looked Great. Priced Great. Nice View.But...Bought mine new from a Dive shop in Cheboygan, Mi. on 7/13/12. The Tempered glass shattered in my hands as I rinsed it out in my pool at home, I tried to get satisfaction from a local service center, as it was purchased on vacation hundreds of miles from home. Warranty from Genesis is useless... All I hear are excuses, its Now 7/17/12.I expected better from a manufacturer like Genesis / Sherwood.Contact me if you can help! This item was not abused, it was defective.MikeBadmask@doctorslime.com"
2,Overall qaulity of the CD was very good.,"The beats that they were using were very powerful. Unfortunatly the lyrics were poorly written, which made the Cd half as good as it could of been"
2,Great if you think like a self-helper,"This book didn't do it for me. It has a lot of overview, theory, selective details and glancing personal accounts--but all of it in a tone of an infomercial. The problem is that this way of approaching any subject rarely gets people to achieve the goals that Pink urges us on to. Instead, it continues an ongoing addiction to self-help books which may be the next silver bullet to our woes. . . but most often it's not.He takes a broad survey of a lot of fields, grabs bits of information and formulates it into theories about being a free agent. Having been a grunt-work temp, a freelancer, and now a homeschooling mom (free-agent education), the descriptions seem less-than-rigorous and his conclusions are overdone. Zeal is a powerful force and Pink has lots of it. But it's a force that hasn't matured and mellowed into evenhanded understandings which are brought by in-the-trenches personal experience. And that is what a lot of us need to join the free-agent world."
3,"David Shiple, Independent IT Strategy Consultant","Daniel Pink gives an interesting pep talk and context for America's would-be free agents. He points to several interesting drivers: need to diversify one's skills and salary sources, increased satisfaction due to accountability and ability to make a difference, less of a need to deal with stifling politics, myth of loyalty from employees to institutions - & vice versa; increase of loyalty to specific projects and individuals in your roladex, ability to control your own destiny, ability to control schedule, less dependent on singular corporate mentors, and the increasing numbers of people doing it, etc. Daniel does not go into mechanics, economics, technology enablers, views from client standpoint, problems with being a free agent, ie managing pipeline, billing, difficult clients, etc. A good book, but like many written in the business advice space, I think it could have been said in a good 4 page article."
2,Very poor print quality.,"I did not read or keep this book. The print quality was terrible (very faint). Looked like the typesetter ran out of ink. Will look for this famous sermon from a different publisher, or look to local library, as I still do want to read."
2,Might work... for someone else,"Only two problems-- wasn't comfortable, and didn't work.At least it wasn't expensive..."
2,This Title Is Misleading,"When I saw this listing I was hoping that this would be the Three Stooges guest appearance on one of Danny Thomas' Wonderful World Of Burlesque specials from the 1960s. It is not. Instead it is two different black and white tapes which have nothing to do with each other. The Danny Thomas stuff is separate from the Stooges stuff, and all of it is public domain stuff, that shows up over and over again under a myriad of titles, but the same old stuff.I am not knocking the actual material. I enjoy the Stooges, and Danny Thomas is great. I am just concerned that so many people are making money recycling the same material, which is poorly transferred and for which I know none of the original participants are sharing in a royalty. I feel this sort of thing should not be supported. Buyer Beware!"
4,If only Angela has married a better tenor!,"I bought this opera while I was on vacation and first listened to it while laying by the pool in Las Vegas. It has some incredibly beautiful moments (as mentioned in previous reviews). But I kept thinking that Alagna displays the same annoying tendencies on this recording that he did when singing at the Lyric in Chicago two years ago - he goes sharp and his tone goes dry when he sings high and loud. It speaks to his less than ideal technique.That aside, buy this recording for the singing of Angela G. -- it's ravishing. If 'sexy' can be transmitted through headphones, she has succeeded in such transmission.However, I suspect that her career will go a lot further and longer than her husbands'."
3,"If Manon were by Leoncavallo, maybe...","Gheorghiu sings beautifully, in bad French.Alagna, who is French, yells like a bad Italian tenor; and his French is worse than his wife's: garbled and gargled; he slurps his Rs in the back of his throat like a bad music-hall singer. Terrible!It is useless to complain, because these two singers are so popular just now that anything they record sells. If you enjoy them, more power to you. But this is a vulgar, loud, unstylish performance. Gheorghiu does have a lovely voice however. Too bad love is blind (and deaf!)The wasted supporting cast is good. The conductor is loud and prosaic.Testament's 1955 recording, magically conducted by Pierre Monteux, with the exquisite Manon of Victoria de los Ángeles and Henri Legay's poetic des Grieux, remains first choice."
2,"Rich case study, conceptual sections come from W3C specs","The book introduces the Microsoft approach to Web services.SOAP part:- 130 pages, 75 of which feature a C++ implementation of SOAP- the conceptual SOAP introduction is more or less directly copied from the W3C SOAP 1.1 specification, it even uses the same examples- the list of available implementations is incomplete and not up to dateThere are 50 pages on WSDL and UDDI, two technologies complementing SOAP (again more or less a 1:1 copy from the W3C specifications).There is a large case study applying the technologies and the Microsoft tools for them (has a section on interoperability). I did not look into it in detail.An appendix gives some information on SOAP::Lite (Perl)."
1,Sorry but ...,"Sorry to say, but I felt this book was no more than a first draft . At the end of it, I had no clear idea on how to write a SOAP message without refering to many other books or the spec itself. Sure the book gave me a basic overview of SOAP, but not one that I could take away and use, and gave me an overall impression that SOAP is complicated and messy. This was a rushed effort, and a waste of time. If this is one of the best books available on SOAP, then it doesn't say much for the technical authors currently working on it."
1,Book is a Waste!,The book explains SOAP on a more advanced level! it provides a custom SOAP implementation written in C++. The book is all over the place. It gets quite confusing for novices that simply want to get started quickly using SOAP.
4,have to watch more than once,You have to watch this one more than once just to catch all the quick punch lines. To me it is like watching an episode of something like West Wing. The dialog is fast and you have to pay attention to keep up. I enjoyed the movie and the What Love Is topic really hits home.
4,Great for the birds,"This is the second one of these I have bought, the only reason I gave four stars instead of five is that the dish is rather shallow and with the tons of robins drinking at it,I have to fill it every morning.The first one lasted three years so that was good value."
5,You learn more from this great book than history.,"This book is amazing on so many levels. It teaches you how trains are designed and built, how math is applicable in the real world, how people get along, how some people are better suited to different, but equally important jobs, engineering, give and take (compromise). But it doesn't quite teach you, it intigrates these lessons in the oral history it is presenting. Superpower could be about anything and you would still learn SO much about life. I recommend this book to anyone, any age. It will change the life of a boy though, guaranteed. It will inspire him to study more at the very least."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I'm glad this only cost me ten bucks (with shipping), or I'd be really pissed. The tiles move and rotate as you move the mouse -very dizzying. The first section where you are supposed to be able to load which layout you want doesn't show up at all. Yes, I have plenty of memory and am running XP - which this was supposed to be compatable with.This was the first time I have ordered a game or program from Amazon and it will be the last. I'll stick to just ordering music and books.I had missed playing Mah Jong and was really looking forward to having it again.NEGATIVE 10 stars for fun and NEGATIVE 10 as an overall rating."
3,Mildly amused,"OK, I should have known. I was just so entranced by the premise and by some of the reviews. But the illustrations are really pretty awful and boring. I couldn't see enough of the pages to tell on that count. The ending is abrupt and lame and I there isn't much of a story. It is told more like a joke with a punch line. That said, it gets some points from me and stays on my shelf because it isn't the same old, same old of kids story books. My two-year-old is very tolerant of bad graphics and poor story lines, and I like it that she has some books about princesses that are non-standard. Good idea. I just think it could be executed better."
5,AQ'S REVIEW,THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST (IN MY OPINION) IN THE SERIES.GREAT BUY AND GREAT VALUE.YOU ARE FOR SURE GETTING MORE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK.
5,Cheers to Sahara Hotnights!,"This Swedish girl rock group have a good grasp of the key ingredients to great rock music: attitude and talent. With their good looks and ""I'm-gonna-kick-your-...-with-my-hot-boots-if-you-don't-shut-up-and-listen"" attitude, they will be sure to entertain you. They definitly make better and harder rock/punk music than most of their all-male AND all-female rock contemporaries. It's obvious to anyone after listening to the record that these rock chics know how to make great punk/rock music."
2,"fine, but tires","There's nothing intrinsically wrong with this CD and, certainly, in small doses it could be exhilarating, but it's not musically complex enough to stand up to too many repeat listens in quick succession."
1,blah blah blah,"I tried to give this album zero stars but it wouldn't let me.There is SO nothing great about this release - besides maybe the hott graphics (though not exactly NEW in any way). First, there is nothing energizing about an unbelievably TIRED throwback sound. What? Go pick up an original. Second, these girls may have been making music for some time, but really, they arrive here on the coattails of other bands whom are of equal psuedo-innovation/. Are we BORED yet? Third, all their songs sound the same and they all dress the same as countless indieposers around the globe.If you are actually interested in finding something unique and an innovative contribution to the ""scene"" check out numbers, deerhoof, outhud, stars as eyes, erase errata, the need... or geez, even blonde redhead (older stuff). OR go buy the real thing of it's day> ... you get the picture.Sorry guys, but even MISSY ELLIOTT is more interesting. As it stands, this stuff is like britney spears with a better haircut. yawn."
1,"Um, they're women rockers...enough said","Nothing is sadder than failed groupies trying to sound hardcore in pop music, which is essentially meaningless anyway. Now add in the fact that they come from Viking-land (home of ABBA) and you have the perfect recipe for watered-down crud. Buy this if you know nothing about music."
3,They Rock Alright Alright!,"Sahara Hotnights are full of rock, edge, and attitude. Forget Avril Lavine, these girls really do rock. You will be rocking from the first track to the last track. Alright Alright!!"
2,Sunpak PZ40X,"I am well pleased with my new Sunpak PZ40X. I'm using it on a Canon and so far the picures have been fantastic. I have been using bounce flash and it fills the entire room.Sunpak PZ40X Power Zoom Digital Flash for all Canon EOS TTL, E-TTL and E-TTL II Cameras (Black)"
4,Mesmerizing! ...but picture looks blurred for an IMAX flick,"When I had ordered this movie, I was expecting an unmatchable quality that all IMAX films provide, with an overabundance of never-imagined realities of our surroundings. I'm a fan of the IMAX experience. This is why my recent purchase and viewing of FIRES OF KUWAIT was somewhat disappointing. The picture looked blurry to me. Not in certain areas, but continuously. Everything was enormously amazing to see, but we kept saying that we wished the focus was more sharp and clear. Oh... the horror....Maybe we shouldn't."
5,There I was....,"Yep, that's right, I was there the night they filmed this production, blooper and all. It was just as funny as it looks, if not more so.As a fan of the original, Julie Andrews version of this production, I was pleasantly surprised by some of the changes made to the song list and sequence. The stars did a bang-up job. If you've even HEARD of Stephen Sondheim, you should own this DVD."
3,You may get what you pay for,"The user photos for this item show the rail installed incorrectly, and I don't beleive there is any safe way to install this rail on a convertable crib. It may be fine for a twin, full, or queen bed and was fully assembled and very easy to set up. But it is rather flimsy and I wouldn't sleep well knowing it may not hold.The user photos are deceiving and should be removed. There is supposed to be 9"" of clearence from the ends of the rail to the head and foot boards to prevent baby/toddler from being strangled."
1,Nive Lives = 1 Star,"I picked up this DVD because I saw Paris Hilton on the cover, thinking it might be interesting if she's in it. I was wrong, this movie was so boring! Paris gets top billing in this film but she's hardly even it. Which is good, Paris Hilton cannot act, I was almost embarrassed for her. She acted basically like herself and didn't fit in because all of the other cast members had British accents, while she didn't. I couldn't even watch the whole movie through. It was not the least bit scary, the story line was lame, and the acting was even worse."
1,Just Aweful,"Anything having to do with Paris Hilton is doomed to be garbage. The premise of the story is trite and in the end leaves the audience wondering ""whaaaaa"". The only person not to die is scottish and that's the only reason why he didnt; because he's Scottish. WHAT????? Sick plot, dumb characters overall DULLLLL. How many movies will they make with ""a group of friends in a secluded castle"" Yes i borrowed the movie which is great compared to paying $20.00 for the DVD and wasting my money and time watching it. YAWWWWWWWWWWN!!!"
3,Great movie,I have seen this movie but many years ago.I remember it to be right up there with all the great horror flicks.This movie is definitely one of the collectibles.
5,Much Better......,Dave Kind of was a little dissapointing on the last c.d although i liked it ok it kinda lost the zest that he had on his previous c.d's. i am a huge dave mathews fan and the thing that made EVERYDAY bad was all the electric instruments it almost sounded like dave was a hard rock band. Busted stuff made up for all the lost sound and brought back what he was well known for...the new release where are you going is a great new song....Good C.D
1,I want my money back,"I have always heard how good the Dave Matthews Band was and I even bought two of their previous albums that I thought were fair. We'll the other day I bought ""Busted"" because everyone was raving about it doing so well on the charts and how good it was. I hate to give any cd a one star rating but this one is no good. The band sounds like they belong on the David Letterman Show too much saxaphones & horns for me..and they don't play anything catchy or appealing. Dave Matthews has a good voice but other than that this cd only had one half way decent song the rest was no good. I'm going to continue to listen to it though...hopefully one day it'll grow on me but I doubt it."
3,"Good, but not great","Yes, the DMB sound is back, but I understood why Dave shelved the Lillywhites. They weren't quality songs, they just had the ""sound"" and that is all anybody seems to want from DMB. He experimented (does he not have the right?) and put out Everyday, which most RATIONAL listeners liked. But, to please the critics...I mean, fans, he reworked those sad little Lillywhite songs and improved most of them as best he could. But, overall this is not close to the bands best work on Crash, Crowded Streets, and, yes, Everyday.This CD is a step backwards and if Dave continues to operate according to the whims of his fans, he will become very boring and derivative of himself in short order. This one is already in my archive. I'll wait for the next one..."
4,Solid CD from DMB,"A solid CD from DMB... none of the songs leap off of the page, but a great driving CD... 'grace is gone' is a good tune."
4,DMB's evolved version of Lillywhite Sessions,"Busted Stuff by Dave Matthews Band is the official studio release of their ""leaked to the internet"" Lillywhite Sessions CD. Included on the enhanced CD are two new songs: Where Are You Going, and You Never Know, as well as a separate DVD with bonus concert material. Busted Stuff represents a cleaned-up and re-worked Lillywhite Sessions reflecting DMB's ever evolving style and musical talent. Hard core DMB fans may take offense to the re-working of their favorite Lillywhite Sessions songs (most of the songs have had major work done to them, including tempo and lyric changes, notably Kit Kat Jam which is now instrumental). That being said, it doesn't take long to accept and enjoy the new take on the old fav's. This album is again (like Everyday) a representation of the band's post Steve Lillywhite growth and expansion both musically and commercially. I highly recommend this album!"
4,Dave's Summer So Far,"Short Review: This CD is definitely worth buying!Long Review: It's good to hear an acoustic guitar in Dave's hands as opposed to the electric one that he used extensively on 'Everyday'. There is nary a bad song on this CD. From the weepy sadness of 'Grace is Gone' and 'Digging a Ditch to the funkiness of 'Kit Kat Jam' to the Grand Jam Finale of 'Bartender', Dave, Boyd, Carter, Stefan, and Leroi sound as good as they have in a long time.Best of all, you get a bonus DVD with two live videos, which give you a good feel for their concerts. It's easy to see and hear the reason for DMB's popularity."
4,"Album is literally ""busted"".","I like this album but my issue is with the ""enhanced"" cd I purchased. This cd will not play anywhere except in my cd player in my kitchen. Not my stereo, car, or computer. My player says ""disc is empty"". Maybe there is compatability issues. The enhance part doesn't even work. As to why it doesn't work in my car or stereo, who knows. Take my advice, stay away from ""enhanced"" cd's."
4,A great album!,"Dave and his colleagues return with a type of album that originally made them the commercial success that they have become. Not as good as the bootlegged ""Lillywhite Sessions"", but still a great album."
1,Sony mis-reporting drive capacity,"Sony thinks that by using compression technology they can make you think that you're buying more ""gigabytes"" than they really deliver. If you buy ANY drive half this size and ""zip"" or ""compress"" a file before you put it on there, you might be able to squeeze double its capacity on there. So, do that. Don't buy these drives, you're overpaying for the capacity that you get."
5,Outstanding!,"Excellent performance on period instruments.I have nothing more to add to BBC Music Magazine's review: ""This exemplary account from the Mozartean Players includes the original finale alongside the customary one. The opportunity to compare both versions is illuminating. The Mozartean Players are outstanding period executants, who invest this score with compelling freshness and vitality. These artists, internationally recognized authorities on Classical performance, bring erudite scholarship and alluring poise to their reading, which I'll be returning to henceforth as a benchmark version of D929. Recorded sound, too, is outstanding.""Performance FIVE STARS; Sound FIVE STARS"
1,Arch of Triumph,"The story line is OK and Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as always. I was very disappointed in the quality of the video itself. It is hard to see, the color is awful and the sound is bad. It looks like a homemade video."
2,Not Recommended,"I've owned and used this mirror for about 6 months. After about a month, the fog-free feature stopped working. They provided a small sample of their fog-free solution but it was not effective. The suction cups are not as strong as they should be. The assembly has fallen many times and the mirror often falls out of the assembly. The razor holders are worthless as with any accidental tap or touch will cause your razor to fall to the shower floor.I'm ready to try a different one as I'm tired of constantly fixing this. This mirror was rated a ""best buy"" by the Wall Street Journal Weeken Edition about 6 months ago. That's why I bought it. I question their testing techniques.I suggest you throw your money in another direction."
1,mean spirited and not accurate,"One of my main concerns with YEC is the way so many elevate the age of the Earth to such an important level. They then began to attack other Christian ministries that don't hold to their viewpoints. Essentially calling into question their character.Were I to ignore someones ministry, I would begin with those who attack other Christian evangelists who are winning souls for Christ. I won't go into the details of Sarfati's arguments (they can be found easily on the web), but they just don't hold water theologically or scientifically."
5,By far the best success book I've ever read.,"This book is head and shoulders above any ""success"" book I have ever read. I have a virtual library of success literature by all the familiar authors, Norman Vincent Peale, Og Mandino, Zig Ziglar, et. al., but after adding this book to my collection I might as well throw all those other books away. Dr. Stanley does a splendid job of giving you the ""nuts and bolts"" of what it takes to live a successful life, presented in a straightforward, no-nonsense style. Unlike so much of the self-help junk on the market today, this book gives you PRACTICAL advice on HOW to achieve ""success God's way."" Buy it, read it, absorb it, and live it!"
5,Success God's Way,"This is the BEST book I've ever read on the subject of success. Charles Stanley, in his usual writing fashion, has again made a complicated subject for most christians, easy to understand, and totally biblical. I have advised most of my colleagues to invest in this wonderful instructional book. Thanks Dr. Stanley, and thank you Lord, for giving us this dynamic teacher."
4,Success God's Way,"Stanley's book is based on important reminders that ultimately our successes should be characterized by goals set with God in mind and that it is too legalistic to apply a cookie cutter mold and say every Christian will become a pauper or must be poor in order to be humble. Clearly being a servant doesn't always mean that we must be struggling financially as well. The important thing to remember is that success in the eyes of the world however is measured differently than in the eyes of God and Stanley does a good job of reminding Christians that if you approach your faith in a way that you are determined to define your successes in a way apart from considering what God wants for you life than we still hold ourselves to be the centre of the universe and not God. I give it four stars only because i try to reserve five starts for my favorite books, but this is definetly a worthwhile read."
3,"""Livin' Out Of A Suitcase Makes A Man Feel Fat 'n' SASSY!""","Somebody drilled the Blues straight into the ""hard rock"" of Texas and touched off a gusher of power trios back in the early to mid 70's (Johnny Winter,ZZ Top, Nitzinger, etc). Stray Dog was one of the hardest driving outfits to ever come out of the Lone Star state. You know that iconic advertising image of the headphoned music fan hunkered down in his armchair with his hair blowing back? I think he's listening to ""Tramp"", a jaw-dropping 7 minute epic that opens the album with a semi-classical ELP-style keyboard buildup, interrupted by guitarist/vocalist Snuffy Walden screaming ""Fasten your SEAT BELTS!""...into some frighteningly heavy blues-rock, with a rave-up ending that makes the Yardbirds sound like Nick Drake. Not for the squeamish! Leader Walden went on to do some moonlighting with Free and Back Street Crawler, and by the the mid-80's had become a respected TV (""Thirtysomething"") and film music composer!"
4,IT WORKS!,"This tea really works! I used to buy another brand, usually more expensive than this one, around $6 the box in the store! then I found here this other brand and with the option of opening an order for whatever the quantity I wanted every month, so I payed around $13 for 6 boxes!!! that's more than $20 in my purse!The only reason I didn't gave it 5 stars is because it doesn't have the best taste, but is not awful either, hey, but it works!!!"
3,"May work, but I can't get it down","I tried drinking this tea twice a day, but the taste is not very good so it's really hard. I am also taking fenugreek twice a day so the combination of the two seems to have increased my milk supply a little bit."
4,"Product works, bags keep exploding","I drank this tea for a year with my son, works great and tastes the best out of the other brands I've tried. Some are NASTY!I found these for a great price on Amazon and the bags keep exploding, not sure why."
4,An Awesome CD!!!,"Ever since I was a kid, I have loved the movie, and a few days ago, I found out about this CD! You get the awesome songs from the film like It's a Nice Place to Live, Almost Like Paradise, Do You Wanna Go Party which are my three favorites! If you love the movie just as much as I do, you'll love the SUBURBAN COMMANDO SOUNDTRACK!!!"
2,What kind of world is this?,"This is the soundtrack to a Hulk Hoganmovie. It is very short(24 minutes long), with only six songs, plus two dialogue tracks from the film. The songs by Rank & File and KC & the Sunshine Band are good. But the CD also features a bad calypso song, a bad power pop song, a bad hard rock song and a bad rap song(which actually features Hulk Hogan on background vocals, I kid you not). Don't get this CD unless you're dying to hear the Hulkster rap."
1,Ridiculous price.,"Have not ordered this item, but after doing the math... $10 per jar of salsa?? gimme a break. there is NO salsa in the WORLD worth that amount of money. especially when we produce and can about 50 mason jars of salsa a year for about $30 (or less). Learn how to can, people! It's something you will use the rest of your life!"
3,"Good variety, but lots of bugs","This CD is helpful in that it has a wide spectrum of math problems to choose from. Also, the hints are helpful in teaching the math principles and theories. The only problem is that quite a few of the problems have errors in the calculations and/or answers. This leaves the student wondering where he went wrong until he figures out the ""answer key"" is wrong. This tends to invalidate the accuracy of other answers. Bottom line: lots of great problems, but the publisher needs to work out the mistakes in the answers."
5,Class!,A great album that cleverly combines Sartre with Sinatra. Jazz pop and post punk from one of the greats.Vic Godard is the master.
2,Was hoping for more photos,"This book was priced quite high ($), considering the number of vintage photos inside. It is a hard back book, however, I truly was expecting many more photos,considering the large size (page wise) of this hard back book. I think there are other books out there with better (& more) vintage photos. I would not buy this book again, if I had the chance."
4,Norwegian Wood,"An excellent, sensitive and visually beautiful film which captures the humanity and intensity of Murakami's novel.Highly recommended.Norwegian Wood - Japanese Movie DVD. All Region with English Subtitles"
5,Outstanding Book,"Father's Footstep was so good I did not want it to end. The story is centered around Jimmy who preferred to be called Bianco. Jimmy followed in his father's footstep dealing in crime.You will not want to miss this shocking story about Bianco and his friend Casino, his wife Kimberly and his sons Bryon and Monroe."
2,Parts incomprehensible,"While some of the content is okay, I often felt the information was incomplete. The chapter on LDAP is literally incomprehensible. After trying to read the LDAP chapter I completely gave up on the book and will try to find something better."
3,"Interest ""scholarly"" exercise however...","This CD set is the most complete all versions of arias, choruses etc., and by simply programming your cd player, you can ""recreate"" various performances. Novel as it may seem it is not enough for me to recommend this set. I believe the Messiah should be really heartwarming, however McGegan create a really thin, cool sound. The orchestra and chorus lacks body -- a very small chamber choir doesn't help either. An interesting scholarly exercise. For those who really want a period performance should consider the excellent set by John Eliot Gardiner and the Monteverdi Chorus."
4,against the grain,"Other reviewers have done justice to the story and backdrop of this film and have highlighted the best performances here (particularly the luminous Isabelle Adjani and the reliable and versatile Daniel Auteuil). The film takes the viewer through the upheaval of a period in French history, with religious fervor and fighting at its core. Catholic Queen Margot (Adjani) and the Protestant King of Navarre (Auteuil) are united in an arranged marriage; not in the least interested in making this match and suspicious of what it means, the King forms an allegiance with Margot to try to protect them from the incessant intrigue and plotting on Margot's side of the family. Certainly for a better outline of the story's more intricate details, other reviews will be better. I can only lend my recommendation for this well-shot, well-cast and gripping tale concerning unlikely allies. (Also offers a gorgeous soundtrack.)"
5,Historical Bodice Ripper!,"Intrigue! Romance! Violence! Poison! Sex! And it's more or less true! This 1994 movie, whose central event is the Saint Bartholomew's Day massacre in late-16th century Paris, is based on an Alexander Dumas' novel: it is a rip-roaring drama with wonderful stars (Adjani, Perez, Auteuil) and lavish costumes. The conflict between French Catholics and Protestants--as an account of a self-destructive religious conflict--has a lot to say to us. But it is plenty entertaining! As an added bonus, the supporting actors are top notch: Virna Lisi is a murderous Catherine de Medicis and Jean-Hugues Anglade (as Charles IX) steals every (twisted) scene he is in."
2,"Wonderful Movie, can not turn off English Subtitles","Let me begin by saying that this is one of the most brilliant historical films I've come across. Isabelle Adjani is positively radiant and the story line is gripping. If I were rating the movie itself I would give it 5 stars, hands down.The reason I am giving this product 2 stars is because I was very disappointed to learn that not only are there no French subtitles (very helpful for learning advanced level French) but you DO NOT HAVE THE OPTION OF REMOVING THE ENGLISH SUBTITLES. For anyone hoping to further their language abilities you will find it very distracting and unhelpful to have the English subtitles throughout.I honestly would not have purchased this version of the film had I known this was the case."
4,"entertaining, colorful and makes you wonder about the Protestants and Switzerland","This movie is perfect entertainment. There is beauty, luxury, violence, intrigue and romantic love. I would recommend this movie to anyone because it is so enjoyable. However, underneath all the gasp-inducing elements provided by the notorious Medicis, you have to wonder how all of this could possibly be about esoteric religious faith. Why would the Swiss who forced out the Amish and scapegoated Jews during the Plague be declared the place of religious tolerance for sheltering French Protestants? WHY did the Germanic states shelter the Protestants? Protestants are just Catholics altered, why would there be a sustained war involving heads of state over a slight adjustment? Very strange. Very suspicious."
5,"AMAZING, overwhelming, beautiful, horrifying movie!","The events in this movie are shocking and horrifying but mostly factual, based on historical events and on Alexandre Dumas' book about Queen Margot. Isabelle Adjani and Vincent Perez are outstanding, as are the other actors. Very romantic!"
3,not so great,"I got this largely for bedtime stories since they're short and not too scary, but... no. A lot of them are kind of mean-spirited and mostly not what I want to impress upon a child. Although substantially more expensive, I much prefer the early Stan Lee monster/sci-fi stories, full of heroism, bravery and moral lessons. Very little of that kind of thing in this collection of stories."
2,sad,"sorry to say I could not get the disc to play- tried a few machines at this end.. guess its just one of those things.the package was sealed etc,. so it isn't you guys.Stephen"
3,A generous helping of summer club beats,"I'll be honest, this is the first club mix compilation CD set that I've bought. This is despite the fact I like these club anthem tunes, but I never thought I loved them enough to justify buying them.The first CD has an unnatural pace which makes it hard work to keep in rhythm. It starts off in mediocrity, accelerates into some head bopping tunes, downshifts straight to first with 'The power of love', hangs around in neutral then finishes off as it started.The second CD has a great start with Madison Avenue's hit 'Don't call me baby' and continues with great enthusiasm until the end.The mixing is crisp, despite a few ruffles. Overall its a great party CD to play in the background while I did find the second CD was the one that really energized and kept my attention.If you're a dedicated fan of this genre, I recommend that you should add it to your collection."
4,Good gift for my teens.,Good item. Arrived as promised and intact. Works well with low to midrange volume. Has poor bass response. Over all I am happy with the product.
2,NOT difficult,"... at least, not according to Will Shortz's standards. Will Shortz is the editor of the NY Times crossword puzzle and has several Sudoku books to his name. From what I've seen, his books always include a range from ""Light 'n Easy"" to ""Beware! Very Challenging"". So far, I've only purchased his books, but since only about 20% of them are really tough, I thought it would be nice to get a book with nothing but the brain-squeezers. Unfortunately, the Sudoku puzzles here all fall into the ""Light 'n Easy"" category.A rule of thumb for how difficult a Sudoku will be is how many digits the puzzle starts out with. A really hard one may have 17 or 18. The ones in this book, by contrast, have 25+."
4,Stateless,Debut album by vocal wizard Lene Lovich. Ms Lovich began her vocal career by dubbing screams in many horror films which accounts for her strong vocal ability. This album serves up delicious 80's flavor new wave with superior recording and production.
4,Sugar strips,"When ever I go for my CHP physical exam, I spent a maximum of 3 hrs for the pee test for sugar. They use the obsolete method of testing sugar in urine instead of blood. Having bought this and functioning perfectly. I test before going to the clinic. I past the urine test on first try."
2,NO Help,Product came knocked down with a bag full of hardware and NO instructions for assembly. There are 9 different types of items to be used in assembly with no clue as to what goes where. Where is the instructions?
4,"soothing, relaxing, great melodies","I am finding this recording pretty soothing and relaxing. Despite the accompanying instruments, it's the recorder, carrying the melodies of the pieces, that is the main star of these pieces. I used to play the recorder when I was in elementary school, oh so many years ago, and so it's nice to hear the instrument used as it was intended to be played. Definitely a good choice, picking this up."
4,Auggie Rose Beyond Suspicion,"Suppose it's easy to pick apart any movie, but if the storyremains in your mind after the next day, what does it matter?Sure, Auggie Rose must'a set Fox back in sales, they aren'tgiving it any play. Goldblum and Heche!? Together!?And...a Darren Aronofsky film it isn't.So what? It's well written, nicely filmed and decently acted.Matthew Tabak wrote and directed this little verite piece,and the players have worked magic with their cameos, to thepoint where it just feels comfortable to watch, like wearingan old plaid shirt and a pair of levi's on a Friday night,sitting on the couch with your favorite girl and a frostie.Only hope Fox gives Tabak the chance to write/direct again."
1,Iceman cometh would not connect.,"this would not download, I tried on numerous times, a window came up and said cannot connect, I sure wanted to see this one."
5,drum beat,David and Steve Gordon's DRUM MEDICINE is unbelievably awesome! I'm a spiritual healer and happened upon this cd accidentally. There are a couple of sections of drum beats that literally vibrate thru the body and the house...very powerful medicine.
3,DISNEY METEOS GAME,"THIS GAME IS A BIT FUN BUT IT CAN GET A BIT HARD AND I DONT THINK ITS SO MUCH FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. ONCE IN AWHILE THE GAME GETS HARDER, YOU START TO PRESS SO HARD NOT TO LOSE YOUR FINGERS START TO HURT. BUT IT IS FUN."
5,Very nice,It is just a great DVD. JD's voice and guitars are wonderful. The band is terrific group of very talented musicians. The recording and video are tops. You just can't go wrong with this music unless you just can't bring yourself to admit that you always have loved his music. Thanks John!
3,"Good for listening, not necessarily dancing","I have developed a taste for Middle Eastern music while learning to be a belly dancer and enjoyed listening to this CD. However, the music does not fit my dance style and has a more modern tone than some might like."
3,Average selection,"The first song sounded really cool, so I ordered the album. It's average, at best. Also to note: It is NOT a kids' album. I mistook it for Putumayo Kids, but that's my fault. I wish they would make an Arabic album along the lines of World Playground or French Playground!"
2,Informative for raw beginner only,"I read this ""book"" and listened to the CD with sample mixes in about a half hour. It seems fine as a primer for a total beginner (which I am) but leaves you feeling more like you just read a magazine article than a book. It gives you a few ideas but just doesn't develop them to any depth. I haven't read the author's other works, but maybe if you slapped them all together you'd get a decent book out of it."
1,Very poor book,"This book is 75 pages of large font and double spaces type. It simply does nothing to help any reader understand anything about mixing audio. It glosses over every subject. For example, mixing drums has five sentences devoted to it. This is incredibly bad. I do not recommend anybody read this even the complete novice. Bad. Bad. Bad."
1,If you want an intelligence test...,"It was like H E L L to get this out of its encasement.I couldn't find my explosive bolts, so I used a blowtorch to pop this tiny bottle out of its plastic display case.Everything else was copacetic, except for the shipping, which cost two-and-one-half times more than the ink!"
4,A wake up call for any restaurateur...,"This book is a wake up call for any restaurateur who believes that creating a menu is as simple as lumping a few dishes together on a sheet of paper. I put thought into my menu, scoped out the competition, and even developed signature dishes. Food Service Menus took me several steps further. It provided samples of market and competitor surveys so I could determine if what I was offering was something that customers would actually want. The book really came in handy with links to menu building software and nutritional calculations. It seems like a lot of work to put into a menu. When you consider that that the majority of your profit rests on your menu, the hard work is well worth it."
1,dangerous,THIS KNIFE SUCKS!!! The blade lock DOES NOT work against simple finger pressure. Totally useless and a danger to use. Sent it back and they replaced it with a good one. I lost it and had to buy another. Same problem but I fixed it using a dremil. I like the knife but it is not worth it if you have to return it or fix it.
3,Average pocket knife,"I think this knife is just an average pocket knife. I was kind of disappointed with the following:-Very hard to open-When new, blade was not that sharp-Pocket clip is VERY tight and hard to get clipped onto pantsOverall, it is a nice sized pocket knife for everyday use. Maybe it will loosen up with time."
1,Low quality,"This knife is poorly made:- Blade rubs when closing due to pressure from linear lock- Due to the above, blade play is severe- Pocket clip broke off same day it arrived (screws failed)- Handle is very soft aluminum very easily scratched and nicked- Due to blade play the linear lock moves and gives out with easeOne could say ""well for the price what do you expect"" but for a few dollars more you can get the far superior (very similarly designed) ---Columbia River Knife and Tool M16-10KZ 3-Inch Black Folding Knife.Various good quality budget knives:-----------------------------------Plain Edge:-Kershaw OD-2 Knife with 8CR13MOV Stainless Steel Blade-Byrd Crossbill Stainless Plain Edge KnifePartial Serrated:-Kershaw Scamp Serrated Knife-Byrd Meadowlark G-10 Combination Edge Knife, Black-Kershaw Volt II Serrated Pocket Knife-Kershaw Clash Serrated"
3,"Decent Blade, Too Small","I like Gerber tools. That being said, I don't really like this knife. It IS very sharp, which is what I've come to expect from Gerber. I have not encountered the problems some other reviewers have mentioned; stiff opening, inability to open/close blade one-handed, bad blade-lock/pocket clip, etc. The main drawback for me is the size of this knife. It's tiny. I CAN open/close it one handed but I feel like I'm going to drop the knife because it is so small.A good, inexpensive knife for light work. I use it for opening/breaking down boxes at work. I would not depend on it for intense knife work, and certainly not self defense."
2,Just not very useful,"I just can't imagine any good use for this knife. I liked the CRKT M-16 that I had. So I figured a smaller, cheaper version would be nice. This knife is just too small to be useful. I never realized this before on the M-16, because it's a larger knife, but the flipper stud makes the knife very difficult to hold near the blade. On a small knife like this, it reduces the gripping area of the already diminuitive handle.This knife is completely useless to me. I threw it in a drawer shortly after I got it, and I have not seen it, since."
4,Three women. Three notes. One fear&#65533;,"On the fifth anniversary of the trial and execution of infamous serial killer Steven Gage, three women separately involved in the Gasey case - Callie Thayer, Melanie White, and Diane Massey - each receive an ominous missive that they haven't been forgotten. But almost as quickly as the women can digest the full meaning of the message, the threats leap from the printed page and into reality. Determined to no longer be a passive victim, Callie Thayer commences the battle of her life to expose the personified evil force responsible for so much terror and violence. Nothing prepares her for the entangling web of guilt, suspicion and untruths she will ultimately uncover.Talented author, Amy Gutman, weaves this gripping psychological courtroom thriller with stunning skill and white-knuckle suspense. Riveting, intense and most definitely addictive, I was feverishly impelled to finish The Anniversary in one sitting...and on the edge of my seat the entire time!"
4,I enjoyed the book,"I really enjoyed reading The Anniversary! Written by Amy Gutman, (author of Equivocal Death) the story introduces you to Callie, a 36 year old woman with a wicked past. Because of her past she has been put into the witness protection program. For many years she was the girlfriend and lover of the notorious serial killer Steven Gage. As soon as she thinks she has escaped her past she gets an anniversary note on the fifth year after Stevens's death. Clues unfold and her nightmare comes true. Someone is after her and someone knows who she is. The Anniversary is a page turner from start to finish. A very good read."
3,Trigger Hippies Break It Down for the Masses,"On their third release, Fragments of Freedom, you can hear Morcheeba scrambling for an audience. The trip-hop payload never materialized; on song after song this wonderful English trio bastardizes its sound for commerce. That may not be completely fair - the songs most like their older material are the least compelling here. The best tracks are those breaking new ground: the Saint Etienne sounding ""Rome Wasn't Built in a Day""; the Parliament/Funkadelic jam of ""Love Sweet Love""; the finger-snapping ""Be Yourself"". Through it all, Skye Edward's vocals are clarion clear (she never oversings a note), and the band is tough as ever. Let's hope they score some commercial success (they deserve a little) so they can calm down next time and just do their (estimable) thing."
2,big disappointment,"virtually a complete departure from what this group did so well on their first two albums. heavily laden with boring choruses and a couple of straight out of left field rap songs, this album almost never delves into the deep dub vocals and soothing, tripped out rhythmns of Big Calm and Who Can You Trust? Quite a let down."
4,Not bad . . . if you let it stand on its own.,"This is a solid album if you let it stand on its own. Of couse you're going to be disappointed if you've heard their two previous albums. But all the booing and ""this is trash"" isn't going to get you a new album just like 'WCYT' or 'Big Calm.' And I think that's the point with this new album. They're branching out. For those people who eat the same cereal every morning and think it's the greatest thing out there, this is NOT the album for you if the ""cereal"" you've been enjoying is the prior two Morcheeba albums. TAKE HEED!Personally I like a little variety, and it's refreshing to hear them not be so brooding and moody. It's good to relax and that's what they're doing with this album.On it's own I give it 4 stars. If I were comparing it to their prior albums, it'd be a different story, but I'm not.Oh, and I don't eat cereal. :P"
1,DO yourelf a favor..dotn buy this one.,Who Can you trust ..a classic..Big Calm...a classic..Morcheeba are a great band..what happened...this album sounds like the bcakstreetboys havin a bad day! Totally bland..totally predictable way below avrage nonsense. I love morcheeba and i still think they have immense talent and they are a fantastic band. When they release their next CD...i am gonna run and get it..but sorry ....this ones is just BAD.
1,In a word: Lousy.,"Compared to their first two albums, I feel I have been had. I can't even listen to it. I bought it w/out sampling it first. It really is pretty sad to get a bad album. Next time, i'll review it beforehand.that being said, I still think the first two albums are genius. esp trust. sade-like sensuality in her voice. mmmm get it if you don't have it.Negu@arches.uga.edu"
1,Vapid Fragments and Horrid Rhymes,"Morcheeba's latest is miserable at best. The lyrics are incipid and the sounds are tacky. Morcheeba has regressed from edgy triphop to bubbly pop inspired nonsense. This album reminds me of accidently leaving that terrible Vitamin C song on the radio too long. Don't waste your money,stick with Who Can You Trust."
1,"insufferable, sacharine, dance skiffle","This record was an absolute disappoint from start to finish. It's one of those experiences of loving a band, buying the new record, and trying desperately to ferret through each track to find something enjoyable to latch onto. And forget the people who wax pretentious about not judging the record in terms of its predecessor, broadening their catalogue or other such nonsense. It's unbearable from start to finish, a motley collection of misplaced disco riffs, grating dance pop and hip hop cameos that would stand much better on their own, divorced from this rubbish. I hope their next record is a return to sanity, or at least something palatable."
2,So bad... and not in a good way!,"I want to respond to what a lot of other reviewers have said, here. I agree, the album is horribly boring. And it's absolutely fine to be a group that doesn't want to be labeled... genre-benders are the best in art, music, and literature. The issue I take with the album isn't simply that it's not trip hop, but that it's BAD. It's just poorly made music. Saying that ""maybe they were purposefully trying to be corny with their lyrics"" doesn't make the lyrics any less painful, nor does it save the poorly- and boringly-written tunes themselves. I'm simply not buying that this was some big experiment in sarcasm or irony. These are not ""feel good"" songs, they're ""Ouch, are these really the same guys that did Trigger Hippie?"" songs."
2,Disappointing,"I patiently awaited Morcheeba's new album. After listening to Big Calm and Who Can You Trust? I expected something grand. Needless to say when I picked up Fragments of Freedom, I felt let down. I would say that this pop direction definitely doesn't suit them. Skye is such a great singer and her talent becomes lost in weak lyrics and radio-friendly dribble. Hopefully their next album will return to their former glory."
1,Bubblegum,This is the most purile garbage I've heard in years. The lyrics could've been written by a 4th grader and the vocals are on the same level. I threw mine away.
1,You can't trust Morcheeba with fragments,"""Who can I trust?"" was an instant classic for me, and I don't even yet own big calm. When I wanted to own more Morcheeba music, all I could get in town was ""Fragments of freedom"". Big calm is nowhere to be gotten around here. Fragments of freedom is a fragmentation of Morcheeba's style. I literally skipped over most of the songs when I listened to the album the first time (something I almost NEVER do), because it just ain't right. On re-listening I can still find little to justify the money I spent on this album. I look forward to Morcheeba's return to their earlier style, or at least an evolution toward something worth listening to. And by the way, what up with that rap track, so not fitting....trying to keep up with ""the sales chart"" jones's???"
1,Fair warning,"I am reviewing this only because I wish to save others the 10 minutes of their time necessary to utterly and completely reject it. To put it briefly, the script is appalling and the actors overplay their roles quite painfully. Most of the dialogue in the movie is a spectacularly failed attempt to recreate ordinary kids. Because the script is appalling and the actors overplay it, this comes off as completely fake, thus ruining the whole film. To top it off, very many of the characters' actions either look fake or are unrealistic. Loth though I am to have my say without watching the whole film - I did manage to get through half an hour of it, but after that it became to ugly to endure - I feel I have gained enough of an understanding to warn that any sane person keep well clear."
2,No functional knits,"I wouldn't make anything in this book other than the grenade and the purple lace underwear (which look really quite pretty). Everything else seems like knit knick-knacks: fried egg, vegetables, cake, a pint of stout, etc. It's quirky and fun but I like my knits to be more functional."
4,helpful and kitchy,This book is full of neat little things to knit like a hand grenade and a cake and bows. But the beginning section explaining all of the different stitches and such is actually really helpful.
2,Some Things Don't Age Well,"This is self-indulgent hippiedom at its, well, most self-indulgent. I have nostalgia attacks ocasionally and a listen to this will usually bring me back to the present. In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida should make even the most hardcore Summer Of Lover blush. The title cut is musically competent but goes on about 15 minutes too long. The endless noodlings will make The Grateful Dead seem like The Ramones. The rest of the songs are basically filler of the peace, love, and dope variety with the possible exception being ""Most Anything You Want"" which at least manages a melody and some cheesy organ for fun. If you yearn for the sillier part of the Sixties, make the purchase. It's kinda fun in a campy Village People sort of way, although I'm sure that was inadvertant. After all, this was intended to be mescaline influenced high art. If nothing else, your children(and maybe grandchildren) will laugh themselves silly when they hear this fossil from your glory days."
4,classic,"not exactly as I remembered...don't care for most of the songs on this CD but it was definitely worth it to get the full (18-20 minutes?) version of ""Inna Gadda Da Vida"" baby! The others I can fast forward!"
4,what a rush,"the first album i ever bought. i have to admit, the first 5 songs didn't get much play. and the same will go to this cd. let's face it, 'vida' is in a class by itself. it is a shame that the digital treatment washed out some sounds that even i could hear. but all in all, a must for early psych rock n roll fans. this one is the granddaddy of 'shroom music and it is great to hear it again. straight. swear to god."
4,Oldie but goodie,I really liked the three different versions of the title song on the CD. The clarity of sound was great and I enjoyed hearing it again.
4,A CLASSIC!,"The single version of 'Vida is what first got me interested in classic rock (I had been brought up on oldies from a very early age). I heard that song late one night on the oldies station and was spellbound by the heavy beat and guitar licks. Not knowing a THING about the song, I instantly envisioned a killer guitar solo hidden somewhere, but didn't know until a friend of mine told me that the song was what it is in it's entirety: 17 minutes of pure hard rock. Ended up getting the cassette and later the deluxe CD, and have since managed to get my hands on most of the Butterfly's other albums. All their music is great, but 'Vida is the album that started me on the road to Iron Butterfly fandom. A classic, plain and simple."
5,Still as good as the first time.,I still remember the first time I heard this song on the radio ( washing my dad's car). I thought it was the most amazing song I ever listened to. The lenght of this song was unheard of back then. It was the first album i bought. It still rocks after not re-hearing it for nearly 40 years.
3,Better as a memory,"Like another reviewer on this site, I was looking for a digital download of the ""long"" version of ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" (which is still not available at this date). So, I too was grateful to find I could order the cd from amazon. The product was all I expected and remembered. The music was ground-breaking in its original context, in particular, their seventeen minute title song. Yes, that song's excessive noodling may sound overwrought today but, in the late sixties, it had the advantage of being one of the first of its kind. Both Hendrix and the Doors, at that time, did more, better, lasting with this genre of music (and these instuments/sounds), but give Iron Buterfly their due. No one combined these elements just the way they did, at the time they did. Still, (buyer beware) I will acknowledge that being there (what else could explain the song ""Flowers and Beads"") was probably ""half the fun."""
1,Unsatisfactory coverage,"I found this book to be extremely unsatisfactory. The authors have rushed their manuscript to the printer so soon after the start of the epidemic that many salient facts about the virus and the disease could not be included in time for publication. I just can't understand why the authors didn't wait until more facts about the disease have been established before publishing their work if they do intend to provide the public with useful information about SARS.The coverage of the Sars outbreak in Hong Kong (the place where I live) is also far from satisfactory. Many of the important events have not been mentioned. Some research results have been totally ignored. There is also not much analysis of the initial outbreak at the hospitals. Such sloppy scholarship is unacceptable, even if the book is intended for the mass market.I can only give this book one star at most."
5,"Light, entertaining poetry from a prolific character actor!",Funny and self deprecating long out or print work! Seek out Buono's audio recording as well! Victor Buono was a true Renaissance man!
3,Heavy and Verse,"I haven't seen this book for 30 years yet I have fond recollections of the poetry, especially the Christmas poem with the line, ""Oh come all ye faithful, Bang, Bang, you're dead. Fortunately, his album, ""Heavy"" is now available on CD from laugh.com."
2,Meh.,"I love Red, Hot and Blue, and also really enjoyed Red, Hot and Rio, so I suppose two out of three isn't so bad.Red, Hot and Rhapsody sounds like something to be played at a funeral. I saw that another reviewer had written ""inspired"" as one of his adjectives to describe this album, and I actually read it as ""insipid.""I suppose, if it was over 100 degrees outside, and I was drinking serious adult beverages, this would be appropriate to play. It's so slow and dirge-like, I can't imagine any other circumstance in which I'd want to listen to it."
4,Charming and sweet,"This is the only Kate Rusby album I have. I'm not a big fan - just like her performances on the album. The settings are intimate and quiet here, the kind of music you'd hear in some pub in a coastal town in the UK. With some influences from sea shanties and English folk, you get the feeling of a modern Jane Austen who sings with a guitar, rather than writes novels. Sweet."
3,"The Weakest Single off of ""Parachutes""","""Yellow"" is the song that got Coldplay the attention of US audiences, and while it is a good song for sure, it is surely not the best that Coldplay offers on ""Parachutes"", their debut album which features ""Yellow"".This CD offers ""Yellow"" and 2 additonal tracks: ""Help Is Around the Corner"" is a short (2'34) throwaway with Chris Martin on accoustic guitar that has the feeling of ""Hey Chris, we need a track for the single, can you make up something quickly?""""No More Keeping My Feet Off the Ground"" is taken from Coldplay's first (independent) release, the EP ""Safety"" (April 1998), and gives a great insight on how much the band has matured since then. It is the best song on this CD, but the sound is somewhat muffled, yet it shows the band at its intruiging origins.Bottom line: for Coldplay completists only.... If you're looking for Coldplay singles, go instead for ""Shiver"" or ""The Blue Room EP"" (see my reviews there)"
2,It might be a good 15psi gauge but the 30psi pic is misleading,There were no specs listed and the picture showed a 30psi gauge. I thought I was buying a 30psi gauge and received a 15psi gauge. The 15psi gauge looked to be decent quality but it doesn't meet my expectations of a 30psi gauge. A quick web search after opening the box showed the model number does correspond with a 15psi gauge.The pic appears to be of model G64-030Jones Stephens Corp. G64-030 Gas Test Gauge Assembly
3,"When it's up it's way up, when it's down it's way down","This was Unity Klan's best offering by far. This album has so much upside with some ridiculously solid tracks. Unfortunately, some of the tracks on here are pretty worthless, so I can only guess at what could have been. Their lyrical content is very good for Gospel rap, their delivery just completely falters at times, and nails it other times.I would strongly recommend going the MP3 route with this album, and only grabbing the tracks that suit you. Of course, you may be down with the whole thing =] I can only say I was not."
5,Great charger!,Works great! Better than the $40 I was quoted for a new one! This one is just fine and I like that it came with a car adapter also! Great price!
4,Great introduction to R&B,"I got this on tape from a bargain bin on a whim. Usually that doesn't work out too well, but this is a gem. Since all the tracks are from 1968, they all have similar production. Most have drums in one channel, vocals center, backing vocals in another channel, they sound live, etc. The sound is really great, artists today would do well to copy it. All the tracks flow together and the record is sequenced well. Side one is all the bigger names: The Delfonics, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations, Smokey Robinson, and James Brown. Side two starts with another Temptations song, and then artists I was not familiar with: Johnny Taylor, Jerry Butler, The Impressions, and The Dells. There are no weak songs. Everything here has aged well. No matter your taste or age, get a compilation like this if you can find it."
3,Incomplete version fo the film,"The film itself is very well done, sadly Sinister's print is a cut version, most likely a TV print. A shame as it's hard to find otherwise. Granted the film was rated PG to begin with, but sexual situations and dialog have been censored. The old Media VHS was the complete PG rated US release version Fox distributed. The film was recut slightly before relase to secure the PG, some nudity was removed / replaced, some overseas prints reflect this slightly stronger edit."
1,Boring,I couldn't even finish this book because it was boring. Any sexual tension was non-existent -- the main character runs from the room when she receives any attention from the man she supposedly loves. Egad! Keep looking if you want an interesting read.
3,Nice Gator!,What can you really say about a giant asian crocodile in a small lake in the New England area. This movie takes you out onto a small lake with a large gator under it. The cast tries to learn how and why such a gator would be in the small lake very far away from its home. The movie has its funny moments along with its moments of action and adventure. This is a great movie to buy especially if you're an animal lover!
3,Surprisingly entertaining...,"This came out around the same time as Deep Blue Sea (I rued the day I saw that clunker), and proved to be infinitely more entertaining. The sight of a huge croc (or is it gator?--gee, I dunno...) in a rural lake is nifty, the juxtaposition of a big monster and a kind-of love story (Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda) is neat, the goofy mad scientist (Oliver Platt) is pretty cool, and Betty White is an absolute hoot. There is real humor here, and this is a very nice mix of laughs and--well, I wouldn't exactly say chills, but at least some halfway decent gasps here and there.Good job, ..."
3,Mindless Trash,I have to agree with some of the other reviewers; Lake Placid was somewhat cheesey. I found myself rooting for the crocodile during most of the movie. This film should have been 2 hours long so as to allow for more character development. Betty White gives the best performance here; she gets creative with the saucy language too !
2,not much to sink your teeth into,"I was hoping for a juicy thriller, but instead got a real yawner. I like Bridget Fonda (as the pretty paleontologist investigating a mysterious death on an uninhabited Lake in Maine), Bill Pullman (as the debonair fish & wildlife hero) & Oliver Platt (as the rich & eccentric crocodile-worshipper), but even talent of this magnitude cannot make-up for a very weak plot & awful dialogue! One shinning star is Brendan Gleason who portrays the corpulent sheriff-with-a-heart-of-gold with alot of humor. I was most shocked by Betty White as the trash-mouthed granny who lovingly feeds the 30-foot menace her livestock! There are some funny parts and the special effects are quite good, but overall a rather silly movie that never quite delivers even one good scare."
5,...Doin' the thing called the Crocodile Rock...,"Yowzers! What a fun film! Who among us was NOT shouting to the screen telling the human characters to RUUUUN! Or to HURRY UP AND Get OUTTA THE WATER! Or was NOT in awe of how our boy the Crock took on the bear--Jiminy Crunketts, I think I would have left the country if I saw THAT in person...Betty White did a little bit of her Rose from ""The Golden Girls"" persona on this, but, of course, she turned out to be a little more twisted...this is good, this is fun! Get the popcorn out for this one..."
3,"Good, but I have Seen Better","Okay, this movie was good, but it wasn't the best! There were some good parts in it though. But I wouldn't give it 5 stars, thats just my opinion!"
2,"Well, not a classic...","This is one of the silliest movies I've ever seen; however, Betty White is hilarious, and it's worth a watch just to hear her cuss. ;-)"
1,made a mistake,"I thought I was buying a dvd i didnt pay attention till it was to late so i really wanted a dvd,"
4,Stupid but great one-liners,I watch this movie over and over again because I love the sarcastic one-liners. The movie simply puts me in a good mood.
2,Whatever folks...,"I hope that this was supposed to be a comedy, because it certainly was not horror (One guy got bit in half and another's head was bitten off? There's scarier things on Looney Tunes.) and definitely not romance (I see more chemistry between rocks in my front yard than between the two characters in this movie who were supposed to fall for each other.). Perhaps it is significant that I can't remember any of the characters' names. This movie was truly horrible. I mean, these people are supposed to be worried that a giant crocodile is going to eat them. They seemed more worried about the mosquitoes. And the whole ""Save the man-eating crocodile!"" thing... come on! Hand me a gun, I'll take the thing out if they won't. But for the most part, I was with the old lady. I was rooting for the crocodile. It should have eaten everybody in the movie. At least it would have put them out of their misery."
1,This movie is a Crock!.......well it is,"Here's another waste of film on the ol' poor ol' alligator being the bad guy..er lizard? yep you guessed it, everythings predictable in the movie right down to the alligator snacking on the helicopter.Oh and snatching the grizzly bear down in one gulp.In my opinion the first Alligator movie was enuff. A suggestion to director Steve Miner, get real and think of something original next time if you please. I have an idea for a movie..how about ""Attack of the Killer Artichokes"". I don't think there's a movie like that inproduction..is there?"
3,O.K Back up here.,"Okey Doke. I'd just like to start off saying that I liked pretty much every jaws rip off, but lake placid just doesn't click. last summer, i was pysched about two movies, lake placid and deep blue sea. I saw deep blue sea before lake placid and whammo. how awesome. Then I found that lake placid was pretty lame. The acting was so-so, but the special effects were WAY overdone. What sense is there building a huge croc for only 30 seconds of screen time? I also thought the laughs were cheap and vague. I dunno, it was pretty bad, but you can enjoy it if you don't take it too seriously"
4,Exile,"Thrilling, inventive and long...... This author knows how to spin a yarn, engage the reader and develop characters to lead you along the story.I would definitely read Mr Folson other work.I am a big fan of Lee Child and through a recommendation from another Lee Child fan, tried this book. Not as good a read, but entertaining nonetheless."
1,Tedious. I stopped reading,"I remember the Day after Tomorrow as an interesting thriller. This book is not a good follow up. The characters are wooden, the plot is silly. The reason why this writer is not mentioned with Dan Brown is because he's not that good. Just one example of the ridiculousness that appears on nearly every page: The bad guy is caught and hancuffed and is on an elevator guarded by two marshalls. He slips off the hancuffs at will (no mention of how he is able do this)and grabs one guard's gun and shoots both guards. Just one of many ill staged scenes. Don't waste your time look elsewhere."
1,allan Folsoms book exile,"It wasn't the book I ordered it is an uncut manuscript version of it.The sellers need to be more specific on what they have ,I just wanted the book it looks nothing like the picture and is very misleading.I'm not happy with this purchase and will probably not purchase again at amazon.If asked by any one i will let them know to be extremely careful as you don't always get, what you think you ordered.Extremely disatisfiedDebi McGee"
2,Please tell me again how Barron and Ford got into this mess.,"Allan Folsom may be regarded in some circles as a gifted and compelling writer of action-packed suspense thrillers, but if one is asked to agree with that assessment, that agreement will have to be based on some OTHER work; The Exile is NOT an example of the characteristics asserted by those who might so regard Folsom.All fiction asks the reader to suspend his disbelief.Folsom, however, pleads with the reader to suspend his or her own intelligence.A more implausible set of conditions and resolutions has NEVER been more repeatedly shoved up my consciousness than when I read ""The Exile"".I want my money back."
2,Disappointing,"I just finished this book and found it disappointing. The first part of the book was very interesting, fast-paced, with a lot of coincidences but intelligent action sequences. I should have stopped there.The remaining two thirds of the book required far too many leaps of faith. The writer dismisses a large section of time with little detail, when it should have been one of the emotionally interesting of the book. Then its nothing but more and more coincidences. It became so far removed from reality that I didn't really have a strong reaction when key characters were killed; I just wanted to be done with the book."
1,yuck!!,"The plot of this book is so far fetched that I can't believe it was published!!His first book was good- I don't know what he was trying for here, but it really defied belief- I can't believe I read the whole thing hoping it would get better!!"
1,Deceptive listing,"If you do an internet search for Cardone 20-FLT1 you will find this is a filter, and a generic, ""can fit"" filter at that. Listing this part as a ""pump"" is false advertising, and I would advise everyone to check carefully what they are getting if looking at any of this seller's other listings."
3,I sleep witht he lights on now.,"I don't even know how to give a rating on this book! It was well written and very informative, but I was horrified!My curiosity on this has been put to rest. Good book, but very disturbing."
2,3club06,"The delivery was great, but tge product was No good it started in the middle of the film... I will give it another chance because of the service. I think i might have just got a bad product this time"
4,Excellent book for women on speaking up for themselves,I would recommend this book to anyone working on increasing their assertiveness skills. Her chapter on saying No - using ways to buy time and saying no directly are particularly great examples of skill building. I refer my coaching clients to this book and mention her examples in my newsletters and on my web page.
4,Great Wrestlemania,"I thoroughly enjoyed this pay per view. Just when I think the WWE is losing its fire, they come back with a strong event like this. Some of the better matches include Shawn Michaels and Y2J in probably the match of the night. Michaels never ceases to amaze me, and neither does Jericho. This was a classic well paced matchup. I thought the street fight between McMahon and Hogan was well done even when these two are over 50 years old. Those McMahons can take some bumps! Rock and Austin put on a good match and Lesnar and Angle have a great WWE Title bout. I'm astonished by how well Angle performed with a broken neck. Watch what Lesnar does at the end of the match, you'll be shocked! As for the catfight, it was just offensive. But the event overall ranks up there with the better Wrestlemanias because of the good wrestling quality. Storyline wise, nothing really happened. But other than that, I recommend seeing this."
1,Utter Junk.,I have to agree with the other poster This toy is utter junk - like every other Paris Mfg product I have purchased. (I guess I never learned by lesson). Caps get stuck inside the toy. If they don't jam-up then only about half-fire. Wow! When they do go off - you can't really hear anything because the cap is being fired inside a sealed enclosure. Snap your finger to a louder sound. Very disappointing.
4,"strong character development, a good read","A very disturbing account of pediphilia, incest, forgiveness, commitment and karmic justice. Blue Calhoun was the embodiment of the addictive personality; blessed by being surrounded by women of great strength and faith. His involement with a sixteen year old girl, lends an interesting perspective, when framed in the late 50's compared to how such relationships are viewed today. His continual relapsing, (whether involving drink or womanizing) followed by bouts of guilt, were entirely believable as this pathetic man attempted to live a life deserving of the women who loved him. I did find the ending disappointing. The karmic justice lost a good deal of credibility at the end of the book. A good read, I recommend to all who like a little weight with their summer read."
2,Frustrated!,"I am having such a hard time reading this paperback book. I have never received a book, via online or in a store, that is so ready to fall apart. Actually, it IS falling apart. It is so distracting to try to keep the book together as I read it. I'm really disappointed that a book in this condition would have been made available without warning."
5,trippy fun,"I had to get this because it was another faithless side project featuring Rollo. A great dreamy, trippy cd. The more I listen to it the deeper it seems to be. The cd glides along until you come to The Oscar Song, which is worth a chuckle, not sure why it is in there, but it really is funny. Some really wonderful goves on this cd, and well worth the money. Oh, yeah, and another thing, be kind to animals, don't eat them.....go vegan. PEACE!"
5,Killer!,"I would have to disagree that this is better than the original. I'm not saying that it is bad, because that would be blasphemy, but the orginal still remains my favorite."
3,"Great photography, but the flavor is lost.","The first movie from the early 1960's is a calassic,and gave us a feel of the surfing lifestyle. The dream of a perfict wave with no crowd still sends the surf-mind to heaven. The innocent of early sixties can't be tranlated into the 1990's, and their the film loses the flavor of the time. The photography using all the new techonolgy is breathtaking, but ""The Endless Summer"" is stlll my choice. I speak from some experence. I surfed the Redondo Beach Breakwater on a huge day back in the early sixties."
3,"Awesome film, somewhat disappointing DVD release","I'm glad to have this film on DVD after all this time! This movie takes you all around the world, from the beauty of the Fiji Islands to the crackpot idea of surfing the bear infested Alaskan coastline and beyond. I've been sharing this film with friends for years, and have been writing New Line Home Video for the past 6 years *begging* them to release this title on disc. Monterey Home Video seemed to have acquired the rights, and although I do give them kudos for coming up to plate with my request, I am disappointed that the film is only presented in full-screen mode with a stereo soundtrack. More importantly, the DVD transfer is rather poor for a modern-day DVD release. It pains me to not give this review five stars, it's such an incredible film, but this DVD release was a bit of a disappointment."
2,HORRIBLE FACTS,"Most people think of Anastasia as the princess in the Twentieth Century Fox movie, Anastasia, but this movie is very misleading. The dates are all wrong, the bloody revolution is ""glossed over"" and Rasputin is ""evil incarnate."" If children want to learn more about Anastasia then it would be better to give them Hugh Brewster's book Anastasia's Album, and let them read about her. Only a few references are made to real life facts such as Anastasia was born at Peterhof, and the drawing ""little Anastasia"" makes for Marie, her grandmother, is identical to the one ""the real Anastasia"" drew for her father in 1914. I do admit that the music was nice. And the film was a wonderful fairy tale."
3,not sure,"This was a gift for my daughter as this was her favorite Disney movie as a child. She isn't fond of the cover and doesn't think that it is completely sealed either. She has yet to view it, but I think she will be happy when she does."
4,Great for Fun,"The movie wasn't exactly giving the correct information and did change the story line a little. However, it is great for children and young adults (teens) to enjoy a film and wonder about what it was really about. I for instance, love this movie. It's gotten me hooked into learning as much as I can about the Russian Revolution. This is a great story that shows what -could have happened- and works out well for all ages."
1,"I should have known better, but it was rated ""G""","I should have known better - My soon to be 8 year old son FREAKED OUT screaming and crying at the Rasputin coming back from the dead scene - we had to stop the movie - try to explain it's only a movie, etc. Whew! and I try to be SO PROTECTIVE of what they see. Our soon to be 6 year old daughter was not freaked, but this is all just night one - how long will it take to get over it? Rated ""G"" evidently just means no sex and no curse words but as far as scarring you for life . . ."
5,Great movie!,"I had been thinking about buying this movie on DVD for ages, but when I saw it on Amazon I just had to buy it straight away!! One of my favourite animated movies and fun for the whole family!"
1,A PIECE OF GARBAGE,"Anastasia is one of the most worst movies I have ever seen. The plot is non-historic. 20th Century Fox makes everyone good. For example Czar Nicholas II was not a very kind and loving person. Rasputin was a very bad man, but he was friends with the czar's family. Vladimir was not this purky fat guy, he was Vladimir Lenin, who ordered that the Romanovs me killed."
5,Best Non-Disney Animated Musical Movie!,I love that this is not Disney--who pretty much has a corner on the market for animated musicals during the 90s. My favorite part is that this is based on a true story! But the music is amazing and Meg Ryan and John Cusack do a fabulous job. Plus Rasputin and Bartok are hilarious. Just reviewing it makes me want to watch the movie lol
3,Light Reading Only,"Lee Hughes has written an entertaining narrative about his own effort to overcome his fear of the water by sailing a 16-foot dinghy up the Intercoastal Waterway. One cannot quarrel with the author's ability to keep his narrative interesting, and I enjoyed the book.But this is not great sea literature. The writing style is clear but not beautiful; Hughes is a complete novice when he starts, so most sailors will already have experienced and learned everything he experiences and learns along the way; and the personal growth evidenced in the voyage is likewise rudimentary, primarily centering around Hughes' adolescent (at age 40) fear of commitment.This is a light book that you'll very likely enjoy. But you'll also give it away afterwards, rather than providing it a permanent place on your shelves."
2,"Well written, great story, would highly recommend.","I found this to be a great read. It is a well written, and humorous story with just enough commentary to really see what was going on in the authors head. I highly recommend the book, and although I am a small boat Sailor, I see this as something that would be very entertaining to non-Sailors as well."
3,"Interesting story, a lot of typos.","This is an interesting story. It gets a little dull at times because it's told mainly through letters and diary entries, but it's still interesting. It has a lot of typos, especially at the beginning."
3,It helps but did not solve my problem,"When I put the thing in I could immediately tell a difference in breathing through my nose. It helps clear up that aspect as they are pretty stiff yet still comfortable. However, when I went to sleep my wife tells me that I was still snoring. I believe this is probably just due to my sleeping positions and being a bit heavier. If you snore through your nose this might help you out, if its through your mouth then I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Very effective,"I bought the large size Nosovent, which I found to be very effective in increasing the air flow through both nostrils. I should mention that I did experience some minor irritation initially until the plastic material ""gave-in a bit.After a few days' use the Nosovent developed a slight curvature and became more comfortable so that there is no irritation in the morning. I think it is a great product and definitely preferable to a septoplasty."
3,These hurt my nose,"I had to cut these down because they were too big for my nose. Even then, they still hurt and fall out so I hope they work for some but for me, not the answer I was looking for."
2,Will not stay in while sleeping,"I found the Nozovent to be useless for sleeping.It is essentially a plastic spring that you put under tension and stick up your nose.The tension presses against the inside of your nostrils to hold open your nose.This works ok while standing still, but if you toss or turn at all in your sleep, this spring will fly right out of your nose.Unless you sleep like a rock, it will pop out.That was my experience anyway.I could only see this being useful for resting if you have trouble keeping your nose open.Note that the lady on the box is not actually even wearing a nozovent.p.s.I also purchased a ""silent sleep"" from Amazon, (not a spring), and it at least stays put better.I'm uploading a photo showing the ""silent sleep"" adult and the nozovent side-by-side."
4,Some improvement in breathing,"Not as effective as Breathe Right strips, but quicker and easier to put on and cheaper to use over time."
1,Worthless,"Just don't waste your money on this product. It WILL not work for anybody with any form of sleep apnea with resulting snoring problems. Wish it did, but it does not. Don't bother.Nozovent Anti-Snore 2 Box"
2,"Helps a little, but not enough.","These things help me breath a little easier, but not enough to make me want to use them all the time. They fall out to easily. I found that I can breathe easier using them inside out. But this way it fall out even more. My nose it slightly irregular on one side, so this may be my problem. I'm not using them anymore."
2,Not confortable,I bought this product for my husband. He only used it one night and never used it. He said it wasn't comfortable to have it in the nose.
5,Can't sleep without it !! Been using it for years now and love it !,"Bought it thinking it can't hurt to try it and ended up giving some to friends and neighbors and they love it too. Easy to take on trips, camping what ever !! I tried the ""tape on"" kind but after a few nights they hurt to remove them. NOZOVENT you just pop it in and pop it out in seconds !! AND NO PAIN !!"
1,I don't feel good about this.,"The book that was sold to me is a LIBRARY BOOK, and probably should go back to the library it came from which is cflearly named inside the cover."
4,Good Full of usefull Information,"Three cd set of Don Steels Radio show, not just don talking but people ringing for advice and some extra support from young woman.There is advice on a variety of topics of the biggest topic is dating, he also answers questions from callers about work related issues."
5,Great Book!,A fascinating look at the the 45rpm record. All my questions were answered including the real story regarding that larger-then-life hole in the middle.Gary West - [...]
5,Excellent Overview of the History of An Icon,"I actually found this very informative and entertaining. This covers both the development of the 45rpm format, amidst a war between record studios, and the history of the music that blossomed on the format. What you have is both a social and musical exploration.I did learn much about music that I didn't know, such as discovering the rawer original version of ""Sh-Boom"" by The Chords. The book prompted me to look freshly at the Doo Wop groups of the '50s, and there is certainly great music to be found.The book also looks at how different companies looked at marketing this blossoming form of music delivery and it differed according to demographics.I highly recommend this informative, largely fun-to-read book."
2,Cheaply made- won't last long,"If you're very very very careful, this might work for you. But if you need something durable that will last, look elsewhere. I really like the menu layout of this player, and for now it works great. But the scrolling button is very cheap plastic and seems like it won't last long. Sometimes it catches. I've already broken the dust cover where the usb cable is inserted. The plastic piece that holds the battery in seems very cheap too; I don't expect it will last long."
1,Don't buy this from Amazon...,"I purchased three of these from Amazon for Christmas gifts. Three months later one is defective. Because I purchased these in November, Amazon tells me I am over the 30 day return policy and will do nothing about it.They count the thirty day policy from the time of purchase even when it is obvious this was a Christmas gift because I bought three of them.Forget dealing with Creative (the manufacturer)...they tell you to return it to the place of purchase because they have so may hidden charges, even under warranty, that it will cost more to send it to them than the original cost.Any local store would have replaced this without question. Shame on Amazon."
4,Overall a great purchase.,I bought Creative Zen Nano Plus upon the recommendation of my brother who is pretty savvy when it comes to technology. It is the smallest MP3 player on the market that I am aware of and seems to be reasonably priced. I love that it comes with the arm band; great for exercising. I'd have liked there to be a bit more memory; 500 songs sounds like a lot but it fills up fast and also you may not even get that many if the song file is a larger one. I was able to fit about 250 songs. Despite that one little drawback I am satisfied and must say that as my first purchase it is a great one overall. Would like to compare to the iPod Nano; the iPod Nano has 4 times the space but it also costs almost $200 more. It may be worth it for a longer term investment.
1,Luther with Stacy Keach,"I was excited to get this video, as I am a long time fan of both Osborne and Keach...I must say, however, that I was somewhat disappointed in the movie as a whole...Overall, I found the pace pedantic, and the premise off base historically....The more recent Luther with Finnes is by far a better overall production....The 1950's production, is perhaps the best overall portrayal of Luther to this date...All in all, I would not recommend this movie...It is a poor rendition of a stage play, which, by the way, is a mesmorizing experience..."
4,Is this really Seb's?,"This Seb's album is not as great as his 3 GU Prototypes. The mixing is good, some of the tracks are excellent (CD 2 : track 1&2), but most of both CDs is commercial and repetitive. The overall impression is not what we usually expect from this great DJ. But, for me, it is psychologically difficult to rate Seb less than 4 stars (even if this one deserves 3)."
3,Not for a windy beach,"On a rather windy day on the beach, 2 of the joints came apart, causing the tent to collapse. I believe the manual says not to use on windy days, so beware. Otherwise, it was somewhat easy to set up with 2 people (3 or 4 is preferred), and the rolling case is clutch. Overall, I would recommend this product for a low-wind area."
2,Folded like a bad poker hand . . .,"The shade structure was easy to put up, and the fabric top section is very nice. However, it folded/crashed in the lightest of breezes; seems to be a design or manufacturing defect. The frame itself is strong enough, but the joints are just flattened pieces of plastic with no washers or reinforcing, and the littlest breeze causes them to bend, the screws/fasteners pull right through, and the whole thing collapses. It collapsed twice within a few hours; didn't even get us through our backyard BBQ. With the help of some duct tape, we got through the BBQ with a modicum of shade, but we have since returned the item."
1,Not nearly sturdy enough,"I've had this canopy for just over a year. When I first got it I thought it was great. I had it up through a few heavy rainfalls and it held up great making me think it was quite sturdy. Then while at a car show that was mildly windy the weakness in the design became readily apparent. The sides of the canopy's structure has no lateral strength, this caused the small vertical area of the canopy to fold inwards at the slightest amount of wind. Once this bent in the whole canopy looses its strength. This canopy has been reduced to pretty much junk after one breezy day. I've seen other designs that have significantly thicker joints to provide better lateral support. This particular unit is not worth even buying."
2,BE CAREFUL!,"The product itself is okay, but I must warn about the condition it came in. The box was completely damaged. It had been taped up so that it could hold itself together. When we opened the box, the tent comes inside a case and the case itself was damaged. The fabric is ripped and the bottom foot is broken off. So much for giving it as a present! I could have gone to Walmart and gotten one in much better condition for the same price!"
2,Broken and doesn,DO NOT PURCHASE!!! NOT worth the money or the headache that came with it. The only good experience was how easy it was to return to Amazon :) The welds on the top were broken when we openned the box and not knowing that we opened the box and followed the directions to open the unit and more of the welds broke just pulling it open from the box so seeing that we put it back in the box and sent it back not even getting to use it. I think they need a better joint for the top as these don't look like they would make it even in traveling to install at your destination. Waste of time and money!
3,Fair optical quality,"This is in the style of the original Agfa loupes. Unfortunately, there is some side to side distortion when looking at negatives."
5,"Doesn't Really Sound Like Tchaikovsky, But Is Still A Great Jazz Album!","What a supergroup of jazz musicians: Kenny Barron on piano, Ron Carter on bass, Stefon Harris on vibraphone, and Lewis Nash on drums....need I say more?This album swings like mad and is a great alternative to the Modern Jazz Quartet. I own all the Classical Jazz Quartet albums, but I felt I had to review at least one of their albums.I will also say that these jazz interpretations of classical music don't really work. They sound like jazz tunes not classical, but perhaps that's the whole point? I'm not sure, but whatever this is supposed to be it's great and worth acquiring as is all of their albums.Highly recommended."
1,Kett is Krap,This piece of garbage broke after 2 days of light use. Customer service is non-existant to totally rude. Don't waste a penny on this junk.
1,ear plug,I purchased these earplugs because of their reviews. They are terrible for noise control. I would not advise anyone to purchase.
2,Not for me,I couldn't get them to stay in my ears. I tried multiple times and even had my husband and co worker try to fit them for me but nothing worked. And they have a greasy feel that I didn't like at all.
1,Don't Buy It !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,"Great package but a piece of junk because it doesn't work! All it does is say ""Loading"" -- forever. A real disappointment because all the accessories looked fine but I couldn't get unit to work DVD video. It did play audio disc, but only for a minute at a time, then it would stop. I should have listened to other reviewers' comments. Audiovox tech says laser reader is probably damaged. I'm going with a better make."
1,Not worth it,"I recently returned this item (for the second time). I both cases it worked for a short while, then failed. The price and features are appealling, but if you can't play a disk it ain't worth much. The Amazon buyers blew it on this one."
2,"it doesn't work. I have to return it,","Love the package, love all it comes with... hate that it doesn't work. I load a DVD and it just says ""loading"" and does nothing. So if you're buying it for a gift, then check it out first if it works. Then I called customer support number on the paper work it came with and they just said they couldn't help me. I have to figure out how to get a new one!"
4,Slim Line Portable DVD Player,"I am interested with it, but it cannot play VCD format. So, I don't like it much because I have a lot of VCD packages, but it cannot play."
4,Great Traveling Tool,We took two airplanes and travel by car and did not have any problems with the DVD. Our kids wanted to get back on the airplane to watch the little TV.
1,Broke 2nd Day,"Bought this as a present for some elderly relatives. Soooo glad a took it out of the box to set it up for them. I can only imagine the frustration they would have felt if they'd received it, only to have it spend forever spinning, 'loading', but never getting to play. It worked fine the first night, but then got stuck 5 minutes into a video the second day. I'd say you get what you pay for, but I would expect better than that for $158 bucks.I'll go check out the 'real' brands now."
1,Wouldn't work after 4 months,"My husband bought this DVD player in July 2005 mainly to occupy our 6 year old on the plane during vacation. We occasionally used it at home also. It worked OK until November 2005 when the DVD wouldn't spin. The screen just continued to display ""Open"". It only comes with a 90-day warranty so we were out of luck there. I was unsuccessful in finding a local shop that felt the cost to repair would be much lower than purchasing a new system. I would not recommend this system."
3,Glued binding,"I was disappointed to find that this book is not ""A Dover Book designed for years of use,"" like my old Dover copy of Songs of Innocence, which has a sewn binding and opens flat. This Book of Urizen will not open flat without breaking. The reproductions are very good, though.I would like to see an edition of Blake with the text in the plates sharpened up so that we can actually read it. I wonder if anyone will ever dare to undertake that task."
2,Details?,"Although a good listing of public campgrounds in Arizona, I found it lacking in many important details. I recently stayed in a campground listed and although showing the correct hookups, it did not mention the site did not have showers-a very important detail to campers."
3,sounds good...,"My 10yo son spent his own money to buy this product, and it worked fine on land. But in the water it got caught a wheel tied up in something. It was difficult to untangle and now that side doesn't work anymore. He had only had it 5 days. Talk about dissapointing. He didn't keep track of the receipt or I would have tried to talk to the company about it. Just be careful where you use it."
2,Not as great as it looks.,"After seeing the ad for these for 2-3 years, I decided to buy 2 of them for kids, thinking they'd be able to race them. Not a good idea, as they both work on the same frequency and can not in fact use them in the same place at the same time independently. Additionally, they don't charge simply and they lose their charges quickly. This was NOT a solid purchase and we were all quite disappointed. In hindsight, I can't believe this toy won awards!"
2,Great When It Works,"We bought one of these for our kids for Christmas. It's a great toy that they had a lot of fun with. By February, it stopped working, after not a lot of use. The lights would come on but the unit wouldn't move. I contacted the company and they sent a new unit, which we received in March. Again, after not much use, the unit has become paralyzed...lights on but nobody's home. This would be fantastic if it would just keep working."
2,poor batteries,"Toy is fun when batteries work; battery life is very short. I have 2 of these (one for each of my boys) and the battery life is horrible on both cars. Also, fitting the battery pack into the compartment is very difficult. Similarly, putting the battery in the remote is very difficult and may result in breaking the compartment."
4,Morphibian,What could be more fun than a remote control car. Easy for kids to use. Relatively short range for control. Only negative is that the rechargable battery is difficult to get into the water proof container.
4,Rameau,"Jean Philippe Ramaeu made a name for himself with meticulously composed suites and operas, and the composer showed an innovation that elevated him above his contemporaries. While Franz Bruggen's approach to the composer is more intimate, McGegan's interpretation is nuanced and captivating."
3,Not as good as I was led to believe,"Someone I know from the internet highly recommended this product. It isn't awful but I like the Elite Vanilla much better. The person who recommended it likes this one better. Just a matter of taste, I guess. I use the powder in my oatmeal every morning to boost my protein intake."
3,"Cute but to expensive, a little disappointed...","I purchased this for my Canon SD1200 Camera, and it fit perfectly. It is quilted and seems it will last a while, but make sure you read the measurements because this is a small case, and mine also Did Not come with the HP logo. It says it does but it does'nt. Which I didnt seem to mind, because I bought this for my Canon."
1,HP Q6227A Signature Soft-Style Camera Case (Pink),"I purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for Christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her. This is the first time I have ever been DISAPPOINTED with a product I purchased from Amazon. It was, in my opinion, not worth the price I paid! The picture looked much larger that it actually was. I wil continue to purchase through Amazon but I will be much more careful and definitely return it if I'm not satisfied. In this case I did not have time to find another camera case.Thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion.Linda Sutton"
4,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,"It was an okay movie. Absolutely great plot Ideas, but the costumes, writing, and makeup totally ruined it. Not totally bad though. If you liked this watch The Fairy King of Ar"
5,Great reading!,"Miss Parkinson has a problem. The real estate market is historically poor, but having a ghost makes the idea of selling a house frankly impossible. Her solution is to hire noted ghost hunter, Christian Reade who has recently had a noteable success. For his part, Christian is sick of ghosts and just wants a vacation, but accepts the job as a favor to his grandfather.To his surprise, the occupants of Sibel Hall, especially Miss Parkinson, are not all that happy to see him and there appears to be a mystery that needs solving, one with an all too human answer. However, the biggest mystery that Christian wants to get to the bottom of is how to win Miss Parkinson's heart.***** Fans of Regencies and ghost stories alike will find this a charming story with quirky characters abounding. *****"
4,"The Art and Science of Cartography, by a master practitioner","I have this book and have perused it and keep it as a reference, but, I am acquainted with Raisz, and must say that if you don't have his landforms map of north america then you are missing the single best map I have ever seen.My landforms course at Penn State was taught entirely from this map, it was the text!With a scientist's understanding and an artist's hand, his maps are pen and ink illustrations of landscape, mindfull of the forces operating beneath the surface. Those forces that 'constructed' them and the eroding forces above that have 'destructed' them.Find this map and,Enjoy!"
3,Not the Best No Way Out but better then last years,"These PPV's sound good but they really arn't.A rematch that I really didn't want to watchRock vs HoganThe return of Austin should have bin more badder and bloody, not funny as most people sayAustin vs Bishoff....HHH vs Stiener....This match was obviouly going to be bad and cause Stiener to go to the low wwe rank like poor Raven.The rest of the matches just didn't cut it for me. This was better than last years NWO but it still doesnt beatNo way Out 2000 and 2001(which I thought was one one of the best PPV's ever including 2000)Overall This Road to WM just isn't good enough to buy. That's what I should have learned.....My bad.3.5/5Later...."
5,"Women, Anger & Depression","This book was wonderful to read. The chapters are short enough for someone who is suffering from depression and has difficulty concentrating to stay focused. Lois Frankel speaks directly to the women in our society. The book is in part a workbook, making the experience of reading it more personal. This book gave me a lot to think about, helped me gain insight to problems I did not give credit to before, and gave me much to talk about in subsequent therapy sessions. Truly a two thumbs up! I recommend it to all women who are dealing with symptoms of depression."
3,ok,This book has some good tid bits but it's a bit repetative. The last chapters have the most helpful information.
4,got the wrong item,"came with different colors than advertised, but since I can't remember who I ordered them through, my bad. They're still a great product and I am happy enough to keep them!"
4,MIDFIELD AND THE BOUTIQUE PEFECT FOR EACH OTHER,"THIS CD IS TYTE, IT'S OLDSKOOL AND DANCE AND EVERYTHING ALL ROLLED IN ONE. THIS CD IS WILL STAY IN MY CD PLAYER FOR SOME TIME NOW."
3,early Wayne Western,"At the start of John Waynes acting career, the Duke starred in dozens of B westerns. Their plot from film to film was about the same and they all lasted about one hour. None of these films were great, but i find them to be a pleasent way to spend an hour."
3,Good and Bad,"Had some good moments and was going at a fast pace but then it would trail off and get really boring. The story just sort of falls flat on itself at the end and all the lead up means nothing. Nothing new and nothing really that interesting that hasn't been tried by at least 500 other authors since The Da Vinci Code became so popular. For me there is nothing in this book that ever made me saw wow or I've never heard/thought of that. When you get to the end of the book and go ""well that was pointless"" then you know the book wasn't that good. Don't read unless the only books you can read is Templar books."
1,Stick with Screenwriting,"Putting aside the basic premise of the book and the Templar mystery, this book is poorly written and annoying. I wanted my red pencil as I was reading it - poorly constructed sentences, large expository sections that seemed inserted solely to show the writer's research, characters so illogical they could never have had the careers assigned them. There are so many points in the book where the suspension of disbelief is simply impossible. Oh, the next piece of the puzzle is under this man-made lake? Let's just put on these handy wetsuits and retrieve it. Oh, it looks like we need to visit Turkey - no passport, no problem, just hop on the plane. The archeologist has some cognitive dissonance about the contents of her 2000 year old find - let's just get rid of it. Each of the final few chapters ends with a ridiculous cliff-hanger. Maybe it works for TV but it only had me guffawing. Absolutely not worth buying."
3,The Last Templar,"This is an interesting, entertaining book that would have been better if shortened. It rambles on with way too much detail. I enjoyed reading it but my mind wandered several times with boredom."
1,No redeeming qualities,"The only redeeming quality would have been if the author had shown courage at the end. While plowing through the bad characterization (people who were good and then bad and then good again, or bad again), the unromantic love affair, the dubious research (chestnut horse with black tail and mane!)I hoped for a courageous ending, but feared the worst. Cop out. Outrageous cop out.Sorry, I can't recommend this book to anyone."
3,Starts well but then.....,I was zipping right along with this book until page 180. The next 50 pages of the book were gone. Just gone. It is a brand new paperback but it is missing pages 180-128. Am I the only person who got a book this way? None of the other reviewers seem to have noticed so maybe the pages are irrelevant. In which case I have to ask myself- is it worth reading at all?
3,It's alright,"Why don't people come up with something original, why do so many people lack imagination. This is a knock off of the Da Vinci Code, and it's selling because the sheep are drawn to this type of fiction now. The last original idea was ""Between Shadow & Light"""
1,Very Disappointing,"Not worth reading! This book starts off amazingly exciting but then takes a turn for the worse by spending more time explain the plot, which is driven by historical myths, than actually having characters interact. Most of all, it presents Biblical rumors as fact which I fear may cause people to actually believe the stuff in this book is indeed true to life. The ending was very poorly written, no surpise ending or exciting conclusion to the unveiling plot. Definitely wasted my time reading this book."
1,Good story but didn't like the tirade.,"The story is good if you can tolerate the anti-Christian tirade he goes into in the book. He goes on and on. Enough already, we get it, you don't believe in God. Any way I liked the story except for the bashing and the ending which was not believable at all."
1,Formatting Error & Weak Storyline,"Purchased this book a few months ago and just picked it up to read. Big mistake because now I can't return it. The formatting is jacked up. Chapters are out of order and the pages are bind upside down. So now I'm flipping trying to find the next page and when I do, I have to turn the book upside down to read it. I've never had to work so hard to read a book!FBI agent Reilly is incompentant and should be thrown out of the bureau. As for the storyline, I guess if I was of the catholic faith, I would be pretty upset. The catholic church did a lot for preserving early Christian history and writings but it also was a major player in polluting the faith for personal gain. My opinion, choose another book."
2,Prepare to be disappointed,"Very interesting beginning, decent, if somewhat formulaic middle, and a complete disaster of an ending. The ending left me frustrated and angry by his complete cop out. Angry enough that I can't bring myself to read anything else of his to see if his writing has improved. Even if it has, I don't think I can forgive him for the ending of this one."
2,very cinematic opening ; & dissapointing ending !,"I bought this book cuz ive been hooked on to the religious theme ever since A&D; from dan brown , and the problem with this books is that it follows a very similar path of other writers like Dan brown an steve berry.If you take the da vinci code, the Third secret and the last templar , they all have a)A vatican conspiracy 2)a Religious Hitman 3)an adventurous couple that saves us all!The opening scene with the four horseman entring into the museum held alot of promise but the book loses its way midway through the book and meanders into a very dissapointing ending...overall dissapointing"
2,could have been so good.....,"This started out as a really good book. I was hooked in the first chapter. Then about halfway thru the book I was hopeing that he would kill off his lead female charcter. When you cant connect to the charcter anymore the book is very hard to finish. I did finish but i wish i wouldn't have wasted my $15 dollars. There was not enought background information about the Templars and you never find out what was in the journal they found. BIG dissapointment!! I will try the next book this author puts out, but i will be getting it used. What is so sad is that this could have been a really great book........."
3,"Nice read, no Da Vinci","Everyone is comparing this to the Da Vinci Code, but to me it paled in comparison. It was a good read, I liked the female lead and the little bit of drama/romance, but when things wrapped up I thought ""that's it""? Plus the ending was completely unbelievable."
3,Good Entertainment,Enjoyable read. good ties to the knights templar and current terroist threats. right vs. wrong long term choice was interesting.
1,Another bad attempt,"This book is a formula.. Characters are not well drawn. The book moves briskly in the first 100 pages and then bogs down into avery preachy last 300 pages. Khoury is a screen writer and this book shows. It reads like a bad ""B"" movie."
1,Two Sides To Every Story.,"The anti Christian tirades in this novel are cogently and thoughtfully answered in Lee Strobel's well written book, The Case For Christ. Strobel's kind and scholarly presentation is in stark contrast to Khoury's destructive attitude."
1,Ok read,"The entire book was like a B movie. Tess, the beautiful ""woman"" did whatever she wanted, no matter who it affected. And the ending, so dramatized and no way believeable."
1,Very boring read,"This one took me a couple of weeks to suffer through. The story was not realistic, neither was the dialog of the characters."
4,historical fiction,"This plot, as other reviewers also noted, follows in the Da Vinci Code footsteps. There were (and will be many historicalf iction books in the past but Dan Brown has created an audience that many writers will try to take advantage of. Raymond Khoury does just that. I find nothing wrong in someone following in somebodys's steps or ideas so long that they do it right. Khoury's first novel is on the right track.The story begins, after a brief prologue in Jerusalem in 1291, in modern day Manhattan where four horsemen raid The Met and steal a mystirious object. And the story unfolds with four central figures, an archeologist, an FBI agent, a priest and the thief. spiced up with Templar mysteries this is a plot that moves fast and keeps the reader interested. There is an interesting twist at the end and although the book is not as good as the Da Vinci Code it flows well and will satisfy the reader. Furthermore it should be a goood prelude for Khury's future writings."
2,Another Templars book,"It seems that in the last couple of decades a new literary tradition was established: the one about bringing out a novel about Templars every year or so. Within that custom, Khoury's book is just that: another Templars book.I was initially excited about reading this novel, for have had much buzz both book and t.v. series. The story caught my attention strongly at first, but around halfway it seemed clear that there wouldn't be a satisfactory way of finishing the whole thing. As someone said, the characters are really cliched and one-dimensional, like taken out from a collectible card game. The ending was just appropriate to the most-to-least plot; at least the author didn't try to overkill.Any of Dan Brown's books is more interesting, and I'm not great fan of those either. Do you want to try something for real? Get ""Foucault's Pendulum"", from Umberto Eco.DAVIDhttp://boywannahavefun.blogspot.com"
2,It Almost Had Me,"This is a good read, except for an overly long and flabby mid-section.The first third of the book held promise, especially with an original 'take' on the Templar secret.This, however, was killed by the self-involved, sketchy main characters and a politically correct, lawsuit-proof ending.The movie would be a good property for Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. They might be able to make the characters worth following."
2,"Beautiful, but touchy.","This lamp is big which my wife and I wanted. The lamp is just super sensitive. Walk past it, sit by it and it cuts on or off. It is rather a pain. I past this lamp up at a local furniture store for $60 more, but it had a switch. I regret it."
5,Outstanding Early Music,"I heard a selection from this disc on the radio, and immediately decided to buy it. It is a wonderful mixture of songs, dances and instrumental pieces that provides us with an excellent overall picture of French music in the 16th century. Too often, early music discs contain music that sounds much the same and tends to be boring. Here, The King's Noyse, playing with great beauty and feeling, give us an outstanding program. Dances are separated by songs and solo harp and lute pieces. It is a joy to hear Ellen Hargis sing and the players are expressive; the recording is superb. The booklet in informative and contains translations of the songs.If you have an interest in early music, I heartily recommend this disc."
1,Angus the dog is troubled by an incoming cat into his house.,"Angus is a Scottish Terrier and is troubled by the arrival of a cat. I read this book when I was in fourth grade, and I'm sorry but this book isn't very good. Words like NOTHING TO DO are spelled NOTHING-TO-DO. This is improper grammar. This might have been correct in the 1930's when the book was first published, but even though I would think that any children's book is bad because I'm 10, this book is even worse."
3,Great ballet but poor picture on DVD!,"I discovered this on a VHS tape and was blown away by the creativity of story and dance on this little known work. Also, a show piece for Ekaterina Maximova. I found the music very creative and modern in a good way. Because I liked the tape so well I ordered on DVD. What a disappointment! One of the rare instances where the picture on a DVD is inferior to the picture on a tape! I give the ballet, dancing and music 5*, the image quality 2*. I have to downgrade my rating to 3*. A pity!"
3,my dog ignores the toy,"I have a greyhound who hasn't really taken to the toy. I would have given it 2 stars, except for the fact that he is a very picky dog when it comes toys. The jumbo size is actually a little too big, and my dog is 70 pounds. If I could reorder I would go down a size and see if that helps. The few times he played with this, he liked the squeakers in the legs, but only 2 legs have them and he would get bored and walk away when he tried the wrong legs and nothing happened. Not his favorite by a long shot."
3,Not the best for hair bows,"I bought this product for my daughter to use and it seems great for present or craft bows, but not the best for hair style bows."
4,Tremendous source of info,"An easy read. A wealth of information. A necessary read for all Americans.I will be buying this book for my whole family, and my friends.Become aware of evil. It surrounds us.Chris"
3,Good documentary..missing something,"This documentary serves to put human waste and consuption into perspective and to ask ourselves and create awareness for where our waste goes. Interesting at times and definitely thought provoking. I enjoyed this documentary, but my only criticism would be that it is missing something that other intriguing documentaries have. I think it isn't supported as much by facts as it should be. Compelling...yet lacking."
5,The Stand,Great movie. I remember when this came out on the scifi channel series special. I have been looking for a copy if it for a long time and now I have it.
5,The Stand,I thought this movie was very very good it was a classic a great movie terific rent it as soon as posible
2,"Good Suspense, a travesty for an ending","I must explain the 2 stars. The acting waned considerably. Yet, I focused on the good performances and interesting story aspects. The story itself is the meat of the film. There are some very ridiculous plot elements, with some interesting ideas and suspense. But, (THIS IS IMPORTANT) I must warn you the ending is so bad that I felt like the rest of the movie's story betrayed me. If the ending were better I would've given the movie 3 1/2 or maybe 4 stars. That's how bad the ending was. Some can argue that that was the ending used in the book. I don't care. If that was the ending in the book it should have never made it onto film, or the ending should've been changed."
3,"A bit more true-to-the-book than many other King movies, but .....","It's been too many years since I've read the book, but I recognize plot deviations when I see them. At least this movie didn't veer as far away as Jurassic Park did from *its* book ... or as far away as *other* King movies did from *their* books!No, really. This movie overall was pretty well done. I, of course, would have chosen some different actors and actresses to play some of the characters, especially Frannie and Nadine, but the remainder of the cast sufficed. The acting was great. The human interaction was very realistic and enjoyable.I gave this movie a ""medium-ish"" rating because it really *tried.* And trying is very important. It's just that I read the book first and *everyone* knows better to expect a movie to equal the book it's based upon, right?! :-)"
3,Nice Adaptation,"Nice adaptation of SK's book. Again, if you want the whole story, please read the Complete & Uncut version of the book."
4,A Good Representation But Read The Book For More,"I was a bit skeptical about watching The Stand after having just finished the book. While I was disappointed that certain parts were left out, I was mostly pleased with what was there. I think that the characters chosen were great, although Molly Ringwald just does not pull off the part of Fran.I loved the commentary that King gives on this DVD. He talks about characters, motivations for writing the book, and general views about scenes. I would recommend it for King fans, but be aware that it is not the same as the book."
1,Be careful,"I never knew DVD had region, and if it's not in your region it wont play in your DVD. I found it out with this DVD. and you would think the people selling this would look at where they are sending to and know it wont play. mine went in the garbage. I wasn't going to take the time to send it back because i'm a very busy woman. Thats why i do so much ordering on line.. So now when i want to buy a DVD i buy it at my local store to make sure it will play in my DVD."
4,Book companion,"Loved the book, loved the dvd. Closely followed the origional printing of the book. It has a great soundtrack as well"
3,Novel was better,"I thought the movie was good, but if you have read the novel first, you would think it wasn't as good as it should. They should have left in the part with the kid. That was a good part, I think. I liked it when they were all regrouping in Boulder, that was still in the movie, but it didn't show enough of it. It just went from people arriving, to the comitee meetings, and then to Mother Abigail leaving, then to ""The Betrayal,"" then to the stand. Just like that. I would say go ahead and buy it, but don't get your hopes up, it isn't the best."
4,Lacks precision but fun,"These blocks, made of rubber wood, are great fun as long as the scale of the structures is kept small. In combination with heavier quality maple blocks (Barclay wood blocks), I find that the lack of precision in the machining of the M&D blocks leads to a bit of instability, e.g. 4 architectural columns placed together does not form a solid even surface for something to be placed on top. Whereas 4 maple cylindrical blocks on the exact same surface provided a solid even surface for taller structures. Anyways, the M&D blocks are still fun, an inexpensive option, and a clever kid can probably work around the limitations."
2,Prog at its Worst,"Normally, when I hear people criticize prog rock/metal as pretentious, self-indulgent, and musically masturbatory, I dismiss their remarks as coming out of anti-intellectualism or an inability to appreciate complex, challenging music. But, not this time. This album is a caricature of progressive music. It is bloated, pretentious, and unlistenable. The song titles are utterly ridiculous, the voice-overs silly or even stupid, and the concept, hackneyed (for this genre). The instrumentation, sadly, is no better. I forced myself to listen to this album several times, hoping it would get better, but each time was torturous. My girlfriend, who is not a metalhead, was present during one or two of these agonized listening sessions and I will never forget the look of disdain she threw the stereo. For a moment, I felt embarassed to be a prog metal fan. But then I just decided to throw this CD in the garbage. That way no one else would ever have to suffer through it again."
3,Decent 70's soundtrack to a movie that no one remembers,"I remember seeing the film on cable in the 1990's. Certainly NOT a big budget film, do NOT even remember it being released.If you are a fan of the music from this era you will like the CD.You can find most of these songs on any number of CD's so nothing special about it.Several hit songs, but as I state, you can find a lot of these songs on any number of CD's."
5,classic,this movie is one of a kind story about a lil kid (fresh) growing up raw seeing all sorts of stuff no one should see
3,3 stars,"PROS: period instruments, fast, cheerful, not saddening, excellent sound quality.CONS: poor instrumental interactions, weak conducting, not thoughtful performance, it losses your attention particularly on slow movements."
2,would be a great product if.....,the manner in which this item was packed garrentees it won't arrived intact.Shame would be a nice product otherwise.
4,Harnell...great as ever!,"This is an amazing disc! ""Lies"" and ""Light At The End Of The World"" are stand out tracks for sure! mind you this is a good metal disc...but is NOT a TNT album! Harnell, delivers as usual! :)"
5,Simply Awesome,"Styles of Beyond's debut album is a modern hip hop classic. So many hip hop groups are signing with major labels these days (J-5 and Dilated Peoples are both currently working on albums for major labels), it's great to see a truly underground hip hop group. All the tracks on the album are great, but standouts are ""Styl Warz"" featuring Rhettmatic, and the absolutely amazing ""Winnetka Exit"". That song has the greatest lyrics I've heard in a long, long time. Styles of Beyond reminds me of A Tribe Called Quest in their prime, with a bit of Herbaliser thrown in, while still maintaining a very unique sound. But if you consider yourself a fan of hip hop - or music in general - do yourself a favour, and pick up ""2000 Fold""."
4,...,"yeah its pretty good. All the lyrics are bomb diggity, but most of the beats lack that certain sumthin that makes you want to slap your pappy. Also, there isnt much consistency within the album. There are a couple of very entertaining jams like #9 and #10, but some of the other tracks are relatively boring and mundane. Overall, a pretty solid effort because the lyrics make up for the shortcomings in production."
5,Best Book I've Read in a Long Time,"This book has been praised in the gay press, but it is much better than even these favorable reviews have indicated. The huge variety of detailed examples of both natural and social phenomena is impressive! I thought Dr. Roughgarden's perspective as a transgendered person enabled her see clearly what others have not seen.Not only has she provided the best information now available about sexual and gender diversity from a biological perspective. She provides the best explanation I've yet read about the biblical perspective on sexual diversity, beginning with Noah's ark and continuing into the New Testament.This is a must read for anyone who values diversity!"
5,I am a fan!,"Amazing book. She reallyUnderstands what it is likeTo be gender variant. Furthermore,Other reasons to like this book include itsGreat section on sexual selection.You will miss out if you doNot read this.Everyone should. EvenPutting aside its somewhatHeavy information load,I stillLearned a lot.Enjoy!"
5,Very nice,My husband loves this raincoat. He works outside all day and he said it is comfortable and keeps him very dry. I am going to buy one for me.
3,not their best...but,"...it is a good disc for sure! ""Saturday Night Special"" is one of the best tunes in the bands catalog for sure...""Eight Days A Week"" & ""Mama We're All Carzee Now"" covers are both great as well. A few of the originals here (unlike their other discs)...are sadly...some of the weak points!"
5,Tracklist and times,1 Black Leather 3:522 Mama Weer All Crazee Now 3:293 Saturday Night Special 3:424 Eight Days A Week 3:355 Takeover 3:156 Right Now 3:377 My Buddy And Me 3:408 Little Lost Girls 4:489 I'm A Million 6:07
2,A dissapointed teen using kid form,"This makes a good movie for some kid who just wants to see pretty horses and exciting drama, but fans of the original movie and, indeed, the books, will be bitterly disappointed. Reno's acting is pretty good, but everything else is cheesy. Alec sneaks a ride to Arabia, and after some dramatic close calls and fights in the desert and some interaction with a pretty girl, he decides...well, I won't give away the ending. Good for kids 10-13, but not anyone older or who knows horses or the book more."
5,The Stallion Returns!!!,"Four years after the first film, l983 would usher in this sequel to the The Black Stallion, and Kelly Reno would once again be the one who rescues the Arabian stallion from other thrilling captivities. There are more horses, exotic locations, and thrilling plots here than meets the eye, and the story gets so much better. But of course, it is ""Cass-ole"" who steals the show - the beautiful black Arabian stallion.A might fine sequel to a great original film. Highly recommended!!!"
1,Dismal,"You would not believe how tech support suggests I determine compatibility for their products. ""You'll have to call pre-sales to get a list of supported devices""Brilliant."
1,Cuts out for no reason,Routinely disconnects from the internet on my cable connection. I can't play online poker or other activities that require a constant internet connection. I take it out of the loop and everything works fine.
1,"Doesn't last long, disposable in a year thing.","I have this router for longer than a year. Was pretty much satisfied with it. Easy to install and set up access and firewall and DMZ etc.From time to time the router needed to be hard-reset. Fortunately, there is an option to save setting and use it after the reset.Recently the router stopped working for good. It just sitting low and blinking with its lights as an idiot. Neither wireless, nor wired connection. Though if I connect cable from modem directly to the laptop, I have the internet just fine."
3,HESTON GETS SWEATY,"Heston sweats alot (along with the rest of the men in the cast, but Heston is the best looking greasy-face), gets naked, and takes a shower with a chick. He also tells Edward G. Robinson he loves him many times. There are some good fights in this movie and Heston is wearing tight pants that are very flattering from the back. At the end of the movie, Heston actually emotes. He does it so rarely that it's a monumental occasion when it happens. What is he emoting about? You'll have to watch for yourself and find out."
4,Blast from the past,"I am old enough to have seen this movie when it was in the theatre, but I never did. So this was a real treat to watch for the first time about 35 years later. When it was new, I may have had a different take on it for sure, but to watch it now compared to our current movie technologies was really interesting and fun."
4,Anyone hungry?,"My father told me about this movie. It actually was pretty cheezy but what can you expect from a movie produced during the 70's. They just didn't have the gizmos we have today to make movies so realistic. Nevertheless the story line was good. I can imagine the world coming to such a state of existance, just not anytime soon. Especially not as soon as the movie predicts."
