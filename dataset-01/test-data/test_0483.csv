2,UMM NO.,"Apple should be embarassed to put their apple on the bottom on this item. I am not happy with my recent purchase of this product. I think the sound quality is great. The whole 'in ear' concept is pretty cool. Some things I was totally against how you can not RUN with then in your ears. If you try to run with them far in your eas there is no chance they will stay in your ears. Also, if you take them in and out to talk to people every so often they start to 'scar' after a while. YOU CAN NOT HEAR PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE IN YOUR EARS AND THE MUSIC IS OFF. I would not reccoment this product i think it is one of the worst products apple has put out."
1,Sour Apple,"Let the wealth of one-star customer reviews for the iPod In-Ear Headphones serve as a warning flag before you add these to your Shopping Cart--to quote a previous reviewer, this product really is an ""ear-dud."" Variations in human ear design aside, one really shouldn't have to be a contortionist to insert a simple pair of headphones. I tried every size attachment and still wasn't able to wear these as designed (and that's only a guess, as the product's instructions are anything but--you shouldn't have to track down an online FAQ or tutorial on how to properly wear headphones). When they were able to stay put for a few minutes, the sound quality was tinny and hissy at best. Needless to say, these have been returned."
2,Not what they appear!,These headphones sound like a great idea. However they did not work for me at all! The soft plastic adaptors do not fit the ear as promised. The plastic is so soft it doesnt stay in the ear. i tried this on several people with differing sizes of ears and none fit! Not one person could keep them in the ear. They fall out. I couldnt tell you what they sound like as I couldnt get them to fit my ear! Sold mine on eBay for half price.
2,Very Disappointing,"I bought a first-generation ipod when they came out, and its headphones wore out pretty quick. I replaced them with Sony Earbuds (ASIN B000094Q77) and was BLOWN AWAY by the sound improvement. I listen to a lot of bass-heavy music and there was simply no comparison. When I bought my new ipod I decided to splurge for the new in-ear headphones to maintain the sleek white look of the ipod (you know you want everyone to be jealous of your cool white ipod earphones) but the sound quality was such a disappointment after using the Sony ones, I'll gladly sacrifice the looks for the better sound. I tried all three sizes and took the fitting advice from other reviewers here, but I just hate them! Big disappointment. Save your forty bucks."
1,Very poor treble,"I got one of these at a walk-in electronics store for $50, I took them to my car and listened to mp3 player for one song before returning them 5 minutes after I bought them. The bass is terrable and the treble is too overpowering of the sound even with enhanced bass audio, it also sounded rather distant or muffled and are much worse than the earbuds that come with any ipod."
2,"Great while they lasted,","I purchased a pair of these headphones because I found the pair bundled with the iPod to become very uncomfortable after a while. Initially they were great: extremely comfortable, great sound, and no tangled mess. About two months after my purchase the right earbud suddenly produced no sound. Thinking that I perhaps inadvertently damaged the cord, and because I was very annoyed with the lack of sound balance, I decided to purchase a new pair with a gift card. Yet the same problem has again occured, this time only after a few weeks of use. I am a big user of various electronics and know for certain that I was not misusing this product, so I am convinced this was niether my error, nor simply bad luck. They were great while they lasted, so hopefully I can convince Apple to exchange my bad set for a new one. Buyers Beware!"
3,"Like the headphones, don't like how they never stay in my ear","So, after reading all of these reviews, I was really excited to buy these earphones. I have had used these ear plug styles before and like them. Well, I bought these and they don't stay in. I don't know if it is that I have small ear canals, that my ears are just too sliprey...they just did not work. THEN...I read on someones blog that they substitue the ear plastic for the SHURE E2 foam inserts (available on Amazon). They work like a charm...now I really like these earphones. Sure they will cost more over time (the foam inserts are $1 each), but to not hear the subway trains when I'm listening to music is a joy."
2,Review of Apple Earbud,"Main problem I had with the earbuds was every time the cord would bump into something it would resonate in the buds distorting the music. To be more specific it, was as if I was wearing a stethoscope.(It uses similar ear pieces.) There was no problem with the earbuds fitting in my ears.I returned the purchase at my expense."
5,spectacular...,"first of all, these in-ear headphones' sound quality is spectacular, no arguing at all. the silicone buds completely isolate the outside noise, block the speaker in the ear, and by these, speakers produce a magnificent bass quality. a very, very important indirect positive effect of this, is the longer battery use by the increased volume feeling. there are a lot of reviews telling the impossibility of the placement and poor sound quality. these are nonsense, results of misuse only. the headphones must be placed tightly into the ear, not as loose as regular ones. they can easily be used even in small ears, like mine, so don't hesitate about that. well, the only negative and crucial part of these, is the price tag."
1,They don't fit,"This item was a total waste of money. I must be weird, but I can't get them to stay in my ears despite all efforts to the contrary. This is especially a distraction and a problem when I am in the gym. I was better off with the stock headphones."
1,AWFUL,"I think this might be my first one-star review.Two iPods and I never was thrilled w/the ear buds that came w/either. The sound was pretty decent, but never stayed in my ears. Ever.These looked like a good solution. 3 different size adapters - how could they not fit somehow? The first size seemed to fit just fine. Not great, but fine. I never even tried the other sets.Why? Because the sound was sooooo horrid. Apple told me, at purchase, that the quality was the same as what came w/the iPods - it's just how they fit in the ears was the difference, but they are WAY off. I'd rather have the original set that didn't stay in my ears to have the tinny sound, no bass music that came out of this new set.I got them today. They go back tomorrow."
4,Take the time; Experiment,"There are enough reviews here to pretty much cover it: the in-ear phones are very good if you can get them in and sealed. Having read all about it, I tried and tried with poor results. Finally, I found that my ear canal seems to be about 90 degrees off from the design of the earphones. When I put them in rotated about 90 degrees ""up"" and a few degrees out, they go right in and stay snug. Great sound, very comfortable. Worth keeping.I agree Apple could do a better job with instrucitons. Just keep in mind your ears may require something different from what you read here."
2,DOES NOT FIT,"Comfort/Fit: The ear buds do not fit in my ear. They fall out whenever i slightly move my head.Sound: Since it doesnt fit, I pushed pushed it in tightly just to hear how it sounds. The sound is clear. There is very little bass even with my iPod EQ at the bass setting. Since it is an earplug, outside noise is canceled slightly. I get better sound from my $10 Sony earphones i bought at walmart."
1,gives me a headache,"I'm so upset I bought these. They fit comfortably but they sound terrible. There's no bass coming through and as a result, they make my iPod sound like a distant clock radio. All that treble and no bass just gives me a headache. And who want's that?Some people seem to love them but many more don't. If you're tempted to buy, make sure you are able to test them first at the store. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
1,Can I somehow give it less than 1?,"1.) Design is bad. Once you've mastered the art of ear bud placementand the contortionist's moves required, you've thrown your back out.You shouldn't need to ""aerobicize"" to put on headphones, sorry.2.) Sound is okay. Nothing a cheaper and more ""wearable"" earphone couldn't beat.3.) Like a few of my other reviewers, the left bud dropped to50% volume first, and as of today has dropped to 20%.I've tried switching left with right, and no doubt it is the buds.Of course, it could just be that my ears are poorly designed.I'll make sure and return them as well.Too bad that a great system like the IPod can't come up with a better product than this."
2,Ugly Bass,"I haven't had the problem as others with the earbuds not fitting, however, I am not happy with sound quality that the earbuds provide. They isolate sound well, but the range of sound that these provide isn't really satisfying. I think it's a little tinny, however I think most users won't be that dissapointed."
2,"poor quality, and you have to have the ears for it","just one thing: these headphones HAVE, MUST stay deep in your ears for you to get the bass response it claims to have. not good, returned mine."
1,Apple In-Ear Headphones Big Disappointment,"Save your money and time and do not buy these headphones. It's hard for me to believe that Apple put their name on such a poor quality product. I purchased these headphones with my new iPod mini. My first listening experience with my iPod was with these headphones. My first impression was that the sound quality on the iPod was poor. The sound through these in-ear headphones was very tinny and flat. It sound like the music was coming through a cheap plastic hose. I was much relived when I plugged in the standard Apple headphones into my new iPod mini and heard a high quality sound from my new purchase. I've sent the Apple in-ear headphones back for a refund and purchased the highly recommended Sony MDR-EX71SL in-ear headphones (in-white, hard to find, but out there). Shame on Apple for putting their quality name on such an inferior product."
1,No Bass - Save your money !,"I couldn't wait to get these earbuds - I am so utterly disappointed in them I could scream! There is no bass and it sounds as though your music is being sent through a barrel (no matter what settings you pick on your iPod to try to make them sound better). If you need more proof, go to Apple.com and read the reviews! On the other hand, these things are highly comfortable (not that it helps the situation any). This is the only bad product I have ever bought from Apple though; usually their products are top notch...."
1,Complete waste of money....,"I agree with the previous review. The fit in the ears is difficult at best. I finally just took off the outer earbud piece and stick the raw speaker in my ears. Now the volume in the left ear is almost gone after less than 3 months, and when I called Apple Support they tell me it is not covered since my IPOD is 10 days out of warranty. The fact that I bought these less than 3 months ago, separate from my IPOD made no difference to them. The claim on their website ""All Apple hardware products, including clearance and refurbished products, carry a one-year Limited Warranty against defects in materials and workmanship."" is absolutely false in this case.You can be sure I will switch brands for my next set."
3,Good... if you're not working out with them.,"I read all of the reviews for these headphones before buying them, and have had mixed feelings about them myself. First of all, they produce much better sound than the OEM iPod headphones, but I did have some difficulty at first getting them to stay in. With the largest ""bud"" they finally do stay in and close off almost all outside sound... given that I'm not moving too much. I tried to wear them to the gym once, and they are impossible to keep in my ears when trying to work out. My recommendation would be to get these for your desk, the subway ride, the plane ride, anywhere that you won't be moving too much and want better sound and decent noise blocking... and stick to your original headphones while at the gym."
2,RE iPod In-Ear Headphones,"I can't believe that I am actually giving an Apple product two stars, but it really is quite generous in this case - they deserve none, but they are just soooo stylish! Too bad they don't have performance to match the style! No matter which cap I used or in what way I tried to force them to stay put, they just wouldn't! I contacted my local Apple Store, and they offered to replace them with the original Wired Remote - Earphone package which is much better! I would really discourage anyone from buying these if they haven't tried them on beforehand - it is such a hassle to return them if you aren't one of the lucky ones in which's ear they actually fit!"
2,"Can't keep them in my ears, too bad.","I thought the sound from these headphones was great. But I have an hour-long commute each way every day, and anytime I move (i.e. walk down the block) the headphones begin to fall out of my ears and I have to jam them back in. I tried all the different 'fits' for the headphones and for me the smallest was the closest to the best fit, and the large and medium ones simply pushed themselves out of my ears. I wish there was a different design for the in-ear-insert, and then these headphones would still be in my ears today."
4,"Enjoyable ""Christian"" Fiction","Although all Grace Livingston Hill's books are strongly ""Christian""(characters are involved with church/church youth groups, etc.) they are also highly enjoyable to read -- especially if you like the assurances, that even though bad things may happen, they will end up happily."
4,Good read.,A feel good tale about times past with reminders of who put us here and why. Anyone who wants to read for relaxation and reflection will enjoy this book.
3,Review by EC,"Seemed disjointed in some areas. Also, there were a few misspelled words which were annoying. Story theme, in general, was good. One question, did Rosa ever get things right? Maybe an idea for a follow up story?"
4,These books are good!,"I give the ""Dark is Rising"" sequence four stars because the books were quite good but there where some dull parts. I read these books in my 6th-7th grade summer! I suggest these books for most age groups. I definately suggest them if you are into good and evil and you like short series. Buy them today!"
4,An exciting introduction to Arthurian legend,"I first read these books in jr. high, and still reread them on a regular basis. It was through Susan Cooper that I first began to have an understanding of who King Arthur was, and I've been a fan of Arthurian legend ever since..."
1,Modern Authur,"Modern ArthurMost people believe the story of King Arthur Ended centuries ago. Not in Susan Coopers Over Sea, Under Stone In this book Jane, Barney and Simon drew with the help of there great-uncle Merry the search for an artifact that will give clues to the real life of Arthur. They nicknamed the artifact the grail. Through a series of clues the children get closer to finding the grail, also an evil group is trying to find the manuscript that lead the children to there first clue.While this book has no direct link to the Arthurian myth it has similar themes, such as loyalty, bravery and a never ending fight against evil. This book will appeal to kids ages 8-10 because the conflict is a bit weak for my taste. I strongly advise no other age group to read this book."
5,a wonderful addition to any collection,"The dark is rising sequence is unbelievable. I read it first when I was about 10, and recently bought this set. The character depth in TDIR is amazing. You really feel like you know each character, and like you are really in the story, watching every scene without taking part. Each book is wonderful on its own but just not complete without reading the others, so honestly the set is the way to go with these. If you read one or two, you will definitely want to read the others. The last book is very moving at the end, and I cried both times when I read the ending. I think that the two best books in this set are The Dark is Rising and The Grey King, but that's just me. I would recommend these to any age for a great read."
1,Where are you Hayley,Don't waste your money or time. Definitely not worth it. You can be standing right next to Hayley and it doesn't seem to find her. My daughter tried it a couple of times and said she wants to return it.
1,creepy and frightening,"This doll scares me half to death. It has a very creepy voice and a creepier laugh. It reminds me of a female Chucky and I'm terrified that it might come alive in the middle of the night and kill me. I don't want it in my house anymore, so I'm going to give it to charity and hope my daughter forgets about it."
4,"Not perfect, but functional","I only have an electric range in my kitchen and I bought the Texport propane stove as a low cost gas option. I use it with my round bottom wok. It's functional and I like it. Only problem is that I prop something under the propane tank because the weight of the tank will slightly tip the burner. It's not a big problem as the weight of the wok baances it out, but it's a little annoying."
5,Great quality - virtually kidproof!,"This is a great castle, waist high on our 3 year old. The drawbridge is a little finicky, but some hot glue secured the chains in place after an epic battle :)Well worth the money."
4,Good little compact stopwatch,"I bought it for a compact lightweight stopwatch when I go walking. It works really well, it's simple to use and I have found nothing to complain about considering how little I paid for it. Also, the clip is handy for putting my house key on so I can get back inside after my walk;),"
3,SportLine 241,"This stopwatch is compact but the alarm is not too loud. The compass is useless. By the way, to silence the alarm from sounding daily, just press START/STOP SET button and, while holding it, press SPLIT/RESET button."
4,Keychain Stopwatch,"At first this keychain stopwatch appeared to be a great product. Because it is really handy and has a lot of features. It has a clock, stopwatch, compass and temperature. The initial cons of this is the compass and the temperature cover lens are protruding that makes it susceptible to daily scratches. This makes the lens blurred so will make it difficult to read accurately. After month of 6 months of used, the display doesn't show anything. When I checked the battery, it showed 0.3 volt only, so I decided to change it. Just 7hrs later, the display again disappear. Not still giving up, I went to go to other battery store to get a better one, just the same after 6hrs has passed, the display disappear again. The next I did is to throw to the bin because it costs me more ($11). My verdict is this it is lousy product. To the would be buyer, don't follow me."
5,Good combination of relationship and science,"The title book caught my eye on the shelf and I could hardly put it down. The science was interesting, and the relationships were as well. Perhaps for someone in the field it was too simplistic, but for a reasonably intelligent person not in the field, it was a stimulating and gripping read."
2,Dissapointing,"the jacket blurb made it sound like a real winner,but I couldn,t say I enjoyed it. Premise interesting, but the characters never grabbed me, and the plot was contrived."
3,Too easy to break,"I love these wine charms! They are cute and easy to use. The magnetic clasps in my opinion are better than the other options. However, they break extremely easily. Just taking them out of the package one broke and beads were everywhere. I lost another one when someone took it off of their glass. They are a little expensive to break so easily."
2,Not worth the Money,"A friend and I ordered The All NEW Seacret Eye Gel a couple of weeks apart. She ordered hers first and it was half the amount of what I had to pay (I paid $60) and I used the same distributor she did. I bought it anyway and it arrived in a timely manner and is in a huge jar, but I have been highly unsatisfied with it. If anything it accentuates the lines around my eyes and creates ""bags."" She has also stopped using it. I would not recommend this product. For the price buy a product you can return if it doesn't work for you."
3,Greek Wedding Series,Enjoyed the follow up series to the movie. Would have liked more episodes but the season was canceled after 8 or so.
1,Why did they bother?,"As soon as I saw the teasers on TV for the series ""My Big Fat Greek Life"", I knew we were in trouble. Sure enough, I thought the first episode was terrible. Gone were the heartfelt performances, creative writing, and general good feeling of the movie. Introduced were campy portrayals, crap writing, and general sitcom non-sense.It made me sad they tried to cash in on the movie's success with this abomination. It did not make me sad when they yanked it off the air."
1,Typical,"TV Execs... always foaming at the mouth, on the look-out for the next ""big thing"" to milk for all it's worth... I wonder if they ever consider the fact that it's trash. What do they care? It's all about the ""CHING! CHING!"". Horrid. You'd think with ALL those actors and crew members, at least ONE of them would KNOW how lame this project is (was). Even the boom-mic-dude was probably falling asleep. I hate these cheap spin-(rip)offs."
2,"Starved the ""Fever"" in this one","Another in Feehan's Series about Carpathian's; this book seemed rushed. While the story line was good, the characters were just not there. I can usually re-read one of her books a couple of years later and enjoy them, but not this one. Isn't worth a second read."
4,Great purchase,"I have been buying these books for years, was great to get this quality of purchase for the price we paid. It's in great condition and so is the binding."
1,Lacking,"This is two stories or books in one. The first reads like it may have been an early draft of the second. Both stories are about some innocent woman who comes to the jungle and happens upon a man who can turn in to a leopard. But the first store lacks an ending and the second is just plain romance novel with lots of sex, hunks of men, little plot, and light on character development. Guess, my expectations were set too high when I opened this one to read. I should have put it down after the first ten pages, but forced myself to read it, hoping it got better. It didn't. It may appeal to some, but it is not my kind of book."
2,Compelling Tribute to Kenya and Ngugi,"In short, Matigari is the name of a former Mau Mau fighter who, as the book opens, comes out of the woods to lay down his weapons and, as he puts it, trades them for the belt of peace. Trouble comes when he begins asking the question ""Where can a man find peace and justice in this world"". We soon find out that in this nameless postcolonial country, there is none to be found. This book is extrememly powerful in its portrayal of the fictional Matigaro, and the Kenyan government also found it powerful. Soon after its publication, rumors began to spread of a man named Matigari who traveled the countryside, fighting for justice amongst the common people. The government soon issued a warrant for his arrest, not understanding that this man was a fictional character. Not long after this, Ngugi himself was exiled from the country. This says more for tthe power of Ngugi and his writing than my words ever could."
4,beautiful illustrations but difficult to count,"I agree that this book's illustrations are breathtaking. They are just like looking at beautiful underwater pictures. However, my 4 year old had some confusion about which fish to actually count. Just like any true underwater picture, there are halves of fish and some that are barely noticeable shadows that are included in the total count.I will say that the text is wonderful and informative about each type of fish or organism. It was very entertaining as a parent to read, and kept my son engaged and attentive. The aspect of a book devoted to even number counting is also a great tool.(although it starts out with one, which surprised me).Overall I would say that it is worth the price, but is more for kindergarten to first grade kids than for preschoolers. As a Mom of four, our favorite preschool counting book has continued to be Richard Scarry's ""Best Counting Book Ever."""
1,Warring Food Slicer FS150 motor gear,"We bought this Warring Food Slicer FS150 which seems well made of metal etc.. After just a short time the motor gear stripped. This gear is cheap plastic. We have replaced 5 of these but, we can not slice even potatoes without it stripping. Do not waste your money on this slicer until Warring fixes their mistake. I will not buy anything from Warring now."
1,Junk,The worm drive on my slicer ate up this replacement gear after 5 minutes of use. I was only able to slice 2 pounds of meat before the gear stripped. DO NOT waste your money.
2,Not what I was looking for,"This book was completely useless to me. I was hoping for a book that would have interesting and varied arena exercises for young horses such as turns on the forehand and rear, spirals, backing two steps- forward two- back three- forward three, etc. Things to work on when you can't get out on a trail.Instead, it is a simple book covering such basics as how to halt, how to walk, jog, lope. Apparently it is intended for someone who is entering a western pleasure class. Not what I was looking for."
1,sucks,"bad directing, bad cinematography, lighting is so off and artificial in so many places, bad editing, bad cuts, bad translation in many places so unpoetically done. cheesy suggestions of the sea leading towards the end. screenplay had the makings of what Kurosawa said was going to be his best film. if he had done this, it would have been a million times better"
4,Solid account of his life's impact on Smith's writing.,"Easy to read in spite of the larger-than-life reputation of Adam Smith. Presents Adam Smith the man as a bit of an absent minder professor who talked to himself.However, the book shines in connecting Smith's life experiences to their effect on his thinking and writing. Extensive use is made of Smith's correspondence to flesh out ideas presented in his published works. The author is clearly more comfortable with the pedigree of thought behind ""The Theory of Moral Sentiment"" rather than ""The Wealth of Nations"", but Smith's ecomonics are still given thorough treatment. The disconnect between Smith's free trade theories and his work as a Commissioner of Customs is explored to the full.A quick read and a delightful look into the Scottish Enlightenment."
3,Works ok for the price,"If you are looking for a high quality super bright lantern then consider spending the money on a name brand product. This is a cheaply made, fairly dim lantern, but that's to be expected for the price. It works and its cheap and if that's what you're after then it will do the trick."
2,Book Falls Short,"While the author's note is one of the most well-written, insightful and powerful statements I've ever read, the poetry itself is a bit corny and falls flat. He should have written short stories."
4,Nice decoration,I put these up in my sons room so he can have something to look at when its bedtime. He loves it! It gives his room a nice space feel. Def recommend for younger and older children too. There are many pieces so more than enough for two rooms.
3,very many very small pieces,I too should have read the description. There are only 5 large stars and the rest are very tiny. What a lot of work it would be to put them up. You can barely get them on your fingers. Definitely not suitable for the ceilings in little kids' rooms.
3,Good quality but does not have as many as pieces as I thought,"The description is a bit misleading. it says Over ""700 stars and shapes"" it comes with about 200 plastic stars that are worth putting on the ceiling. Then it has 2 sheets of junky stickers we tossed out. It also comes with a teeny tiny amount of putty that is just barely even enough to adhere all the shapes to the ceiling. Then a few kept falling off because they didn't have enough putty. Overall the shapes are cool, now that they are up they look amazing and filled the whole ceiling with stars easily. I just wish the description was better and that they weren't so cheap on the putty."
2,Quantity over Quality,"I purchased these stars for my dorm room because they were inexpensive but most importantly was how many there were. I appreciate being ably to buy things in bulk but now in hindsight I see that this was an unfortunate purchase.The majority of the stars are diminutive, the adhesive provided is a joke and worst of all the glow on the stars lasts less than 3 minutes. I blame myself for thinking this was a good idea in the first place."
2,NOT bronze at all...,"I purchased this product with the description in mind. However, I just had a chance to use it, and it is not bronze! The color to be exact, is a taupe. If you're looking for the dark bronze that is on faucets/fixtures etc., then do not buy this one!"
4,Finally a color I can use...,"Hello... I have been trying to find a gray that is not so chrome like... or flashy, yet not primer. I needed a textured paint but since I am painting a building in ho scale, it had to be fine fine texture. Well, this is the paint. It does have a very suttle after shimmer which helps since I wanted to simulate a polished granite tileand this is the right paint for this project. It goes on well, and the texture is as promised.If you want to save some money, try putting an undercoat of primer or even another color (textured) if it is available at your local store, and use this for a finish coat. So far I am impressed with its dry time and look. I hope your project works out for you too."
2,Worked well for three months,"I bought this heater 3 months ago and it worked fine at first. I had used it about 20-30 times when it began decreasing in its heat output until only the high setting would keep the unit running (the thermocouple would not sense enough heat on the med and lo settings). Not wanting to deal with the hassle of sending it back and having some experience with these things I accessed the main jet and carefully cleaned it and the threaded chamber it's in, reassembled but to no avail. Same sluggish operation. Long story short, I disassembled deeper into the unit being carefull but in the end, I scrounged some parts off another heater and got it working properly. This is an example of another pc. of huooey from China. Too bad, it's the only heater like it out there taht I know of...appropriate for certain tasks."
4,watch fast burning,"The heater works extremly well. The only problem is when burning, the heater will sometimes burn like a blowtorch. When this happens, the heater needs to be turned off and relighted. If not the burner element well burn out in the center and will not perform well and will eventually stop working. Also, I have not been able to find a replacement burner for the heater and had to buy a new one."
4,works great,this little heater works very well i took it hunting and also night fishing here in erie pa kept me warm and is quiet shipping was slow 9 days went from mississippi to ohio then to pa then back to ohio then back to pa all fedex then they took it to the post office to bring to me 9 days
1,Probably not your best choice!,"Compact propane heater that attaches to the propane tank, but not made with high quality. worked well, but after a few uses, the control only worked on one setting, high. Looked to be easily bumped and knocked over creating a fire hazard."
4,Decent,"This book has short sections on most outdoor themes. The text is quite sparse, but the picture are quite nice and instructive.I just bought my first DSLR camera. I bought ten photography books on amazon. I'm evaluating these books from the perspective of a semi-advanced amateur."
4,"Portable, for quick reading.","It is what it is. It's small, it's cheap, it covers the UBS4/NA27 Greek vocabulary and it's not too hard on the eyes. It gives help for some of the verb forms for which beginning students have difficulty finding the entry.Most entries for the words that have more than one translation into English don't give any help for deciding which translation to choose, except for occasional verse references. You can't use this dictionary for exegesis papers, but it's good for ""quick"" reading.This separate binding is useful when reading a Greek-only NA27. The dictionary is bound in with most copies of the Greek-only UBS4 sold in the U.S.A. (but not available bound in with NA27)."
5,Henriette really love the cats...,This book show a graphic history of the love of a women for the cat's world. Can you know what the cats think?... Henriette Ronner have the answer whit each one of her paints
2,So-so at best,"Well, I listened to most of the tracks on this album and must say that none of them moved me at all. Overall, The Format sounds a bit too produced and radio friendly. Indeed, if your cup of tea is music like the Goo Goo Dolls, then this is right up your alley.I've also noticed that over 80% of the previous people who've rated and reviewed this album are from Arizona, the band's home state. And they most likely can't help but be a little biased in their opinion.These guys have a long way to go (and out of the AZ pizza parlors) before they reach the level of quality bands such as The Wrens, Broken Social Scene, Pinback, My Morning Jacket, etc. Go out and pick up those bands' albums instead...you'll be much happier if you do so."
2,So-so at best,"Well, I listened to most of the tracks on this album and must say that none of them moved me at all. I still can't put my finger on what is so appealing in The Format's sound to the reviewers here. Overall, this sounds a bit too produced and radio friendly. Indeed, if your cup of tea is music like the Goo Goo Dolls, then this is right up your alley. Go for it! Pick it up!I've also noticed that over 80% of the previous people who've rated and reviewed this album are from Arizona, the band's home state. And they most likely can't help but be a little biased in their opinion. The best thing to come out of AZ in a long time is Z Trip, everyone knows that, but that's another story.The Format has a long way to go (and out of the AZ pizza parlors) before they reach the level of quality bands such as The Wrens, Broken Social Scene, The Shins, My Morning Jacket, etc. Go out and pick up those bands' albums instead...you'll be much happier in the long run if you do so."
2,The Format has only a few note-worthy songs,"I first heard the format in a sweaty rock club on the North side of minneapolis, opening up for Switchfoot. They didn't really catch my ear at the time, but a friend of mine alerted me to their tunes a couple of months later.The Format isn't bad. In fact, they're very good...at playing one song. While ""Interventions and Lullabies"" is certainly not void of great tunes, it just so happens it's one tune played 12 times. While ""The First Single"", ""Give it Up"", and ""Tune Out"" are three very good and insanely catchy songs, they're nearly interchangeable. That may be good for pop audiences who listen to the likes of Britney Spears and Avril Lavigne, but The Format has to work harder for a rock fan like myself. Their stuff is good, it's easy on the ears and very melodic, but more than one melody would've been nice."
4,Gypsy Jazz Guitarist,"I originally purchased this video in 1994 and every eight or nine months I rewatch it. The video focus's on Django's life history and some of his experiences. At the beginning of the video there are some great scenes of young gypsy guitarist playing classic jazz standards. The video also introduces many Django stylists playing throughout Europe, Bireh Lagrene, Babe Reinhardt and many others. The video and music quanlity are well done. The final scenes were recorded at an annual concert which is held in memory of Django at Samois Sur Seine. If you purchase this video it will surely pass the test of time and you will be re-watching it for many years. After watching this video it is one of my lifetime goals to attend the concert held in Samois Sur Seine each year in June."
2,Pointlessly Gimmicky and Underdeveloped,"Some of the characterization of the girl Sam leaps into is cute, but for the most part, ""The Wall"" was too gimmicky for my tastes. The idea is, he leaps into this girl's life when the Berlin Wall is being built and later when it is torn down. I guess that's supposed to mirror the time the barriers in her family were built up and later when she and her brother finally had the courage to tear them down and face their father's abuse, since the BERLIN Wall never comes into play that much. Whatever. The Wall angle was really pointless, and the second leap into the woman's life was so short that it left no impact whatsoever. Altogether, an underwhelming QL effort."
1,Avoid,"Worked OK, but died under the ""heavy"" use of my 15 year old. His ""tough"" peach fuzz must have been too much for it."
4,Great book! I learned a lot about myself!,"The hardest part about writing a personal mission statement is knowing where to start. This book takes you through the process step-by-step in a simple, yet effective way."
3,The First Cosmonauts,"If you are a die-hard old Sci-Fi lover, then this is probably a must. Much of the special effects in this 1935 film are well done, and the walk-around view of the docked space ships is simply unsurpassed by any older movie I have seen.Then again, some of the special effects are simply not well done or are silly.The ""walk-around"" is worth the money all by itself. And, believe it or not, the silent film's actors do a pretty good job making it seem real and purposeful."
4,"Does the job, but takes awhile","I bought this for shaving the region ""down below"", and all I can say is if you are doing the same, make sure you keep up with it! If you wait too long between shaves and the hair gets longer than 1/8-1/4 inch, you're in for a lot of pain using this shaver. On short or sparser hair it works just fine, and you can rinse it under water to clean it."
2,where is my book? It is over one month,I have been waiting for my book for over one month and yet I have not seen anything....T_T
5,Love this product,"I've been a very satisfied Fujitsu Dynamo user for years. This latest incarnation of the product is the best yet. It's more portable than previous Dynamo products, in that it uses the PC's USB port for power and is very light and small. And the reputation of its Magneto Optical media being more reliable than CD or DVD technology has yet to fail me. I've never had a single read/write corruption problem with this media. I rely on it for critical data backups on a daily basis in my office. I can't say enough about this product."
2,It wasn't as good as his others.,This one book was kind of boring compared to his other books.It wasn't as suspenful as I thought it would be.
5,Frindle,Frindle is a realy good book. Nick is so cool because he made a word that is in the dictionary 15 years later. This is the best book that ever I read! I love this book and I hope you will too!
1,Dont waste your time reading this.,I dont like this book because it bascically was the same story over and over again it never changes.I really dont think you should read this book if you like good books.Ha Ha Ha.........Ha. I would recomend the wonderful Landry News.Dont waste your time.
3,An Intellegent Boy,I like the book called frindle. I think Nick is a smart student. I also think frindle is a clever name for a pen.Mrs. Granger was'nt happy when the whole class used the word frindle. I did'nt like this book because it did'nt have enough action and it was to easy to read . I reccomend this book for firstb to third grade.
2,"Okay book, but could be more exciting!",This book had a great ending but could've had more excitment!! The title Frindle is what Nick Allen changed the name pen to! The part were Nick's principal came to his house was the most exciting part!! I think that this is an okay book!
2,"Interesting, i think not!!!","This book started out ok, then as it went on i started to become more bored. I read it because i had to do a book report. Andrew clemets has lots of other good books but this is not one of his best!!"
4,It is a great book read it!,Frindle is a great book read it because it is very funny. It is funny because who on earth knows what frindle is. (frindle is a pen). My favorite part is when Nick finds the pen.(frindle) Then the whole school finds out and they call pens frindle.Frindle is one of my favorite books I gave it four stars because it is a very fuunny book and it is intresting and wonderful.It is intresting because it has many intresting parts. And it is wonderful because it is a great book.And it is one of my favorite book because it is hilarious. I love books that are funny wonderful and great because it is all those things.
4,My 7-year-old son liked this book,"Says my son: ""It's a book about a kid wanting to change the name of something to frindle, but i shouldn't say it because it would be a spoiler."""
5,Frindle,"Frindle is an awesome book. I absolutely loved it! Nick Allen is a ten year-old guy trying to make his mark in society. Well, sort of. When his mean teacher, Mrs. Granger, gave him an essay on words and how they're started. His plan to distract the teacher blew up in his face and landed him an essay due the next day. He wasn't about to let this happen without a fight. Nick starts telling everyone to say frindle instead of pen. It works, but the teachers won't put up with it and rebel against it. Mrs.Granger, giving out tons of detentoins everyday especially seems to hate it. After many news reports and angry parents, frindle was put into the dictionary, and Nick wins, but not after finding out that Mrs. Granger was on Nick's side the whole time. By causing an uproar, news reporters came and made the word famous. I would recommend this book to just about any reader. I stayed up all night trying to take my eyes off the pages. It is definitely a most read book!"
3,Boy with a smart wit!!!!!,The book could have been better but I thought itwas okay. It neededmore excitement.I liked Nick but hated Mrs.Granger. Overall it wasokay.
4,Frindle By Andrew Clements,"I liked Frindle because it was funny. I thought it was funny because making up words is fun.I also like to make up words like Nick.It was kind of weird because making up a word and putting it in the dictionary!!!The story was funny,serious, game like, and a little surprising.The story is interesting how a little word can go a long way.Nick Allen he made up a word and then, boom, the whole school is using it. Then the whole state is using it. Then the whole United States of America is using Frindle it!!!! This is my book reveiw by Christina Staniszewski"
1,awesome....not,It wasn't every exciting i think people want to read something more than a pen named frindle but i guess it was a ok book.Mabey if it had more characters than it would be a tiny bit better. My reading teacher read it to us in my class.Mabey if it had more intersting things in it instead of a pen.Than it would be a little bit better.and it was only about a boy and how he makes names up for a pen and gets in trouble for making up a name and that isn't very exciting.But if you made up some more things that i would have listend to the book.
1,Would Have Got Negative Ten If I Had That Option,"By Peyton MowerNow, creativity is what makes a book good, this book, though, was just childish. I mean renaming a pen. So stupid I am going to die. Never read this book. EVER!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great!,Wow! This is an aweome book! I would recommend this book to 4th-6th graders. It is about a language arts teacher that does not like the dictionary: She loves it. Nick is pretty brave . Nick comes up with a new word : frindle . The language arts teacher's name is Mrs.Granger. Close to the end Nick's word is almost on everything. Have fun reading it! Karen G.
4,Frindle Review,"This book is about a boy named Nick who always wanted to know everything about different words, like how they're created, how they came to be that word, why are they called that? Well, his fifth grade teacher, Mrs. Granger, loves dictionaries, and hopes that it helps children with words of any kind. Nick became so interested in it, and on accident, he called a pen, "" Frindle"". No one knew what it meant, until all over the world, people knew about this boy named Nick, who created this new word. When he got older, everything was pretty much to normal, and still famous for his word, "" Frindle"" that everyone uses now, instead of "" pen"".San Anselmo, CA"
4,A Frindle Book Review,This book is great for all young readers. It is hilarious. Every page will make you laugh. You will not want to put this book down. Frindle has all of its readers wanting to read the other books in the series. It is filled with so many funny comments. Andrew Clements (author) has some great ideas. Every one of his books will make you laugh and want to read on. It is on a best seller list and is also on The Horn FanFare List. This is one of my and many other people's favorite book.
5,Yes buy it for your child!,"This book is fun and very well written. My 9 year old loved it so much she asked me to read it like 50x. She was so persistent that I had put down my own book which I don't often do, to read her book and see what had moved her so much. It was just a great story. Well written and in no way obnoxious like some of the other kids books who's characters have to be brats to be interesting. I cringe sometimes but accept it as what has to be ignored to keep my child reading something fun. Well this book raises the bar. It was fun and yes educational! The kids wee smart and good and polite! It was all that a children's book should be. It's the kind of book that inspires them to love reading and a mother can approve of."
3,Maybe a little above average?,"I'm not usually too harsh on my critiques with CD's, so this one rates somewhere between decent and good. The title track, ""Forever My Lady"" is a nice slow jam, but there's not too much beyond that. ""Come And Talk To Me"" hit the charts back then, so that's a nice track to get you back in the nostalgic days of the early '90's. Aside from those two tracks, there isn't too much to rave about. Jodeci does their best in ballad form, so I'm not a big fan of their faster, more up-tempo, tracks. But, if you prefer their faster tracks, this might rate a little higher for your taste. For me, I think I prefer their compilation album than this one."
5,Good Improvements since 2004,I like some of the improvements QuickBooks have made. Common sense improvements and the usual easy to use program.
5,Excellent Product,This is the best accounting software that we have used. I am so glad that we found it. It makes our jobs super easy.
2,Proprietor,"Big problems getting this thing to load. QB should have known and adivsed us. Required changing many buried settings in XP Pro and Home.Slows down system in multi-user mode. Would I do it again knowing all this...50-50. Many graphic changes that don't change what you do or how it does it, just where you find it and how it looks on the screen, so you'll have to re-learn a little bit the first few times in.I've always liked and recommended QB, it's still a great system, but the 2007 upgrade may NOT be worth it. I bought only for the 3 user multi-user option and got the 07 upgrade with it. The presentation of customers or vendors is better and you see more on the screen without buried clicks, but it appears the graphical interface changes are more designed to get a dummy in to the system rather than enhance it for a seasoned user."
4,Best game for bonding with your teens,"This game is easy to setup and learning to play is a snap, but this is not a passive game. You will be running and jumping and moving with this game, so be prepared. A search through the house may even be required, and while it takes work, the investment is worth it.My teenagers and I had so much fun with this game that we laughed until we cried, really. It is not everyday they get to see Mom don a calphalon helmet and sing a song. My husband hates board games, and he eventually came to the table to participate because he heard all the commotion. My kids are 14 and 15 and this was the perfect game to liven up an ordinary snowy weekend."
4,Good metalcore band...,"Lately i have seen alot of crappy metalcore bands out there but thats not the case with kse because their music is original and great! My favorite songs on this album are ""self revolution"" , ""life to lifeless"", and , ""fixation on the darkness"" those songs plus the other ones make this an amazing album with awsome riffs and interesting lirycs which im not used to listing to but it passes! Buy it!"
1,Glad it totaled only $6!! :-(,"Bought this thinking I could watch movies on my television with it, but I was wrong!! Doesn't work for video! Only sound! I have a dock for sound! I ordered this cord mainly for video!! So much for that! :-("
5,Greatest of the series,This is the best Cd of Thump's old school series! It has the barkays. Enough said.
1,zzZZZZzzz......,"fall asleep is exactly what I did about 5 pages into this book. I am a huge yoshimoto fan, but banana, you are capable of much better!! I don't know if it is the translations or what, but ever since amrita I just can't get into her books. They seem repetitive, and are getting boring. The characters seem to consist of a timtid main character, a weird friend, and some complete weirdo male character who always winds up dying. I hate to even say that because I think yoshimoto is very talented. But I am not so sure if I will be reading any more of her books."
2,"Exhaustive, but ...","For me, this book doesn't say enough bout Eisner's creation of the Spirit and his early years in the comic business, but it will tell you all you want to know about his construction of instruction manuals for the army or how Cat W. created the master archive list to all eisner's work."
2,It's not what you expect: avoid.,"This is not the gorgeous Michael Galasso string music from the movie, this is some fairly underwhelming Casiotone renditions of the music from the movie. Wanna hear someone doing ""California Dreamin'"" on a Lowrey organ? Sure you do.The packaging, on the other hand is *really* good. Excellent cover art and booklet. Two stars for the packaging."
1,Don't Bother,"You were kind enough to replace my first order of these razors due to the fact that one never worked and the other wore out quickly. The second pair seems to be pretty much the same. One sputs and spurts and the other works only when I shake and tap it several times. I used to own another brand of these razors that were great, but I can't recall the name, unfortunately. I am very disappointed in the product, but I'm very satisfied with Amazon and the way in which they are trying to please me every way they can."
2,Let the buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The X-men Inferno hardcover is verrrrrrry different from the paperback!!!!!!!!!! The paperback does NOT NOT NOT include the X-Factor annual, nor any of the X-Terminator issues. Usually the paperback and hardcover are identical in content, but not this time! Thanks Marvel for being a bunch of cheap bastards and cutting out a good chunk of the crossover, without telling anyone!!!!!!!!!! I wish I would have known this before buying it!!!!!!!!"
2,This book is not worth reading,"as soon as you start reading this book, you'll find out that the auther has very limited knowledge about astro-science, as well as basic startrek-science concepts, not to mention the characterization and the plotline. I am a loyal fan of Voyager, however, I found this book difficult to accept for the reason that both the characterization and the concept of science are illogical. My conclusion is, this book is not worth reading, in fact, it will make you more confused about everything in ST Voyager."
5,Kouros- Timeless and Amazing,"My husband has worn Kouros since we were dating 21 years ago. I absolutely love it! If it ever disappears I will be lost. It smells clean, fresh, and so romantic without being musky. It is one of my favorite smells in the world and reminds me of the greatest times and memories. Thank you Yves Saint Laurent!"
4,A fun way to learn American history for the family,We use this as a family game at night. It is a good conversation starter and has been used by us since my daughter was 10. Most of the time we just read the questions to eachother and don't use the game board.It can also be used as a supplement to any homeschool History program.
4,Maybe It's My Cat's Fault,"She isn't the brightest cat around. The whole reason I got the cat door was so the cat could get out of my bedroom without waking me (she would make a whole bunch of noise at 4AM) but not be able to get back in unless I want her in.I ended up doing quite a bit of modding to the door to make it quiet. At first, she would just paw at the flap. This would then smack back down and make a ton of noise which defeated the purpose. Now I have the flap smack into padding instead of hard plastic.It's not a horrible door. It doesn't jam or anything like that.The side that is not held on by screws did fall off like other people had said. I really don't care though. For reference, I did install it on a hollow door."
3,No problems with the cat,The door and frame works well.My cat has broken 2 of the swinging plastic doors.-------
3,PetSafe Cat Flap Small,Bought 4. All the cats fit through them easily. I did have to take the doors off though. They were a little noisy when being used.
1,"NICE WATCH, BUT IT DOESNT WORK GOOD","I've bought 3 Kenneth Cole Watches before, and they all work good for 3 to 4 months then after that you always have to set it in time... doesnt give the time right... you always have toput the correct time.. another thing is you can only replace the wrist band thru them... would never buy any of their watches ever again...NOTE: this review was not just for this watch, but for their entire stock and models"
3,Ranting in his old age,"Anton Szandor LaVey does a lot of ranting in this newest book and offers less useful insight and perspective for Satanists. This book is a personal expression for him to express his annoyance from living with humanity, his ""Tasmanian fleas."" He describes his objections to being used by others and it is clear from his book that it is not meant to be used, but is actually exactly what he claimed it to be: ranting about his life among humans. For a real useful look at Satanism, read _Lords of the Left Hand Path_ by Stephen E. Flowers."
5,Great read for the darkest of us all.,"Anton LeVay. What a man he was and what an intellect. The man hardly finsihed high school but he could read Nietzsche and interpret every word. Then, he could go on and bring it into a modern interpretation to our current society. Few have been able to do this nearly as well as Anton.This book was published after LeVay passed from his body but you can tell where his ideals of eternal life really were. They were in his writings and even though he knew he would not get to enjoy the reactions of others from this tome he knew it was more than fit for public consumption. Thank you Mr. leVay. You're missed but at leaste we still get to enjoy your amazing wit and cleaver Nietzschesk dark humor."
5,If you want to understand the history of the Church read this series,This is the series to read if you want to truly study and understand the history of the Church. The author uses primary sources and clearly and easily references his research. The series is for the more advanced student but they can also be useful to the beginner. these books enabled me to understand better what was happening in the world during these different epochs in history. These books have no match.
2,Not the overwhelming book promised by the 5 star reviews,"The Emerald Cathedral has some strengths. The sense of place is rich and evocative, for instance. The prose however is not very clean; poor paragraphing leads to confusion in a number of places. The Emerald Cathedral is more of a religious story than a bigfoot tale."
4,Hard to find something like this for the price,"This is an amazing model for anyone who loves old, ""American-Muscle"". THIS IS NOT A TOY! This car breaks extremely easily, its plastic is about as thick as a CD case (on most of the body). Also you will need a lot of materials before you buy it. It doesn't come with anything but white, and chrome pieces. You'll NEED AT THE VERY LEAST paint, and model cement/hot glue. Over all, for the price, this is a great model to keep on your shelf and admire, but do not buy this for anyone under 13 (A LOT OF PARTS!), but as a Mustang enthusiast, I give it a thumbs up!"
1,DE-STRYER,I am a third semester student of veterinary medicine and have as such used Stryer as the requiered reading for my biochem course. I find the book confusing and difficult to overlook. The way chapters are divided do not make much sense. Espcially the devision of the DNA parts. The language is also somewhat complicated particullary for one to whom english is not the main language. The facinating little anecdotes and what not about digitalis and Benjamin Franklin could just aswell have been notes insted of a part of the text. In genral a confusing book.
1,Not worth it,"I did not get much from this workout. I have been in physical therapy on and off to treat a running injury and my therapist loves and recommends pilates. I attend classes as much as I can afford, but thought doing a video at home could save me money.But, I don't get any benefits from this DVD - didn't find it challenging or interesting. Disappointed."
3,One of two great Batman games,"I loved this game when it was new, and still like it many years later. The only thing that's changed is that I'm not nearly as good at video games as I used to be. I beat this game originally, but this time around struggled to beat the second boss. Still a great game though, and I still think the graphics are great for an 8-bit system."
5,great scratch cover !!!!,I bought this product for my door jams scratches. Mines is natural stain trim and baseboards SO it worked perfectly in coving up.
2,More a salve for many small scratches; useless for single deeper scratches,"BOught this after some brief research on how to cover up about an inch scratch in the engineered floor in the rental unit I was vacating.To give some color, this was a darker cherry colored floor scrached by dragging a dresser. Applying the product to the scratch left a conspicuously shiny area, while also marginally covering the scratch. You'd have to be seriously myopic to NOT see the scratch still.Other reviewers note success on furniture scrached by pets. I believe this product would be far more successful on multiple, less deep scratches left from claws on a housecat. It even notes on the side of the container that the product should not be used on deep scratches, but I would not have characterized my scratch as deep at all.All in all, not worth the $9 I spent on it (although my landlord accepted the attempt at repair). Shipping also took forever from Pyramyd Air."
5,Like Magic,This almond stick is the ultimate magic eraser for wood furniture. It's amazing the difference it makes and dings it can correct!
1,Never Eltron again!,"Pros:It shaves quiet and clean. The foil cover that cannot be lost is very convenient.Cons:Efficiency is very low because of the small diameter of the rotor and little size of the foil therefore shaving takes long time.Manual says that with fully charged battery it provides 7 shaves, but in reality it barely does only 3.The biggest drawback is that shaver pools out hair time to time that makes shaving kind of torture.AFTER WARRANTY UPDATEAfter warranty was over the foil has broken. A new foil can be bought only from Eltron itself for $42(!)Never Eltron again!"
4,One of my all-time favorite books...,"I adore this book. I have read it several times over the last 15+ years. Corman has created a likeable but flawed protagonist: a boy from the old neighborhood who makes good, becomes an advertising wiz, marries a smart, beautiful woman, starts a family, and lives the American dream - for a while... I love this book because it is a tale of a man's personal journey up - and down - and ultimately to the place where he feels at peace with himself. It seems to be a theme that Corman has used more than once (Kramer Vs. Kramer, 50) but in my opinion, he hasn't matched the quality of The Old Neighborhood. It is a humorous and touching story. Corman's best."
4,Great book,This book did take me a couple of weeks to work with but its a great book I really do recamend it!
1,Horrible,You get what you pay for. Don't bother with this at all.My car charger did not work at. See other reviews on the problems w/ the leather case. Save your money.
1,Never worked!,We bought this collar with high hopes but those quickly went away. Our dog kept barking and after a little while we realized that it never actually worked! Just returned it this week. Easy return though!
2,Dont think it works,"This comes with a 6volt battery, but I almost threw it away due to packaging. Once inserted into the big box housing, its a simple screw to secure everything in place. The collar is long enough to fit around my bulldogs giant neck, but doens't have so much excess that it's a safety hazard. My gripe is that the box has a light on it and no matter which way I had the battery face, it did not light up. How do I know if this thing even is doing what it's supposed to???"
2,Did not work for my dog,"Maybe the battery died already, but I had the collar on the dog yesterday and she was her usual yappy self,I've only had the collar on the dog three times and took the battery out of the device as instructed when not in use. Pretty poor battery if it died after a few hours use !Either that or the dog got used to being shocked and it did not work. Either way , I'm not very happy with its performance. I think a training collar would have been a better choice.The collar was working when I first got it. I actually tried it on myself and got a nasty shock! It WAS very painful! So I'm not sure why they said this wasn't a shock collar! It was WAY MORE than a vibration!"
1,Product is not as stated.,"Innotek BC-50B Free-Spirit Automatic No-Bark Dog CollarI ordered a rechargable item, but it is not. Furthermore, the battery that came with it lasted less than a day."
3,Sad :(,"Well this thing works, but it scared the crap out of my dog. I put it on him and he barked and then it went to a yelp (a cry for help.) I felt so bad for him. Now when he starts barking I just hold it up and he stops whatever he is doing and jumps in my lap, like, ""PLEASE...oh... please don't put that thing on me."" Then he just shivers like crazy, this must be a powerful shock. My poor baby!"
4,Lifesaver!,"This collar performs exactly as it promises. It is a very effective and accurate bark correction collar. The battery seems to last much longer than other collars I have purchased.The only thing it is missing is a power button. In order to shut it off completely, you have to unscrew the battery cover and remove it."
2,Frustating!,The collar works great but ... the battery that came with it was dead so I had to run out to Radio Shack to get a new battery. I ordered extra batteries to go with the collar but Amazon is showing the wrong batteries so I made an unnecessary batterie purchase.VERY frustrating! I order from Amazon.com because I don't like to shop in stores. I could have gotten this at a pet store and saved time and money for shipping and battery replacement.
1,Buyer Beware,"I have two mini Dachshund Dogs. One is quiet as a mouse and the other will bark at everything.I reviewed many collars and thought that I found the perfect one. Wrong!Innotek describes this in their own words as a "" harmless static correction"" I tried it out myself and it is a down right electric shock! The same shock as an invisible fence system.I read some reviews that described it as being just like the old wind up hand buzzers that we used to use when we were kids.What planet did you grow up on? My hand buzzer was no where near what you described.I am sure it will work for a large dog but this isn't what I had in mind for my little fellow.."
4,Good Product,"I have only had it for a couple of days, but it seems to be quite effective, and works as advertised."
1,defective collar,"This antibark collar is suppose to gradaly give stronger shocks as dog keeps barking, but instead it gives full shock on the first bark. Than as the dog screams in pain it keeps shocking it. I dont recomend this product to anyone."
1,Doesn't work at all-Dont waste your money,I bought this for our new dog that barks ALL THE TIME. It zapped him once on the first day then nothing after that. I took out the battery to reset it and it zapped on the first bark then nothing after. It now doesnt zap him at all or it is so faint that he doesnt care. I have a training collar that zaps also. It has settings for 1 through 10 (10 being strongest). I can put on level 1 and hit the button and he responds. I have used on myself and it is a very faint shock but enough to stop in his tracks. This barking collar must not even be that strong. It is a total waste of money and time. having to take out the battery for 1 minute to reset it is crazy. It should just shock and that's it.
4,No bark collar,"Mixed reviews. When our dog (beagle) is wearing the collar, he doesn't bark. When the collar is off, he still barks. What he has learned is not to bark when he has is no bark collar on. We keep hoping this behavior would also happen all the time, but so far no luck."
1,Welcome to the Soviet Union,"Nobody should have to deal with Intuit. Like Microsoft itself, there is simply no excuse for the kludges and offensive policies Intuit foists onto its ""customers."" I would NEVER buy this software if there was an alternative. I am now unable to email my invoices (which Intuit routes through its own servers, not my email) so that I'm forced, for no other reason, to upgrade.This time I'll also have to replace my computer, which frankly I don't want to do.Thank you, Intuit, for shoving your craptastic, UNintuitive software on a captive audience. You're the Bernie Madoff of the software world. FEH!"
1,No doubt great but unsuitable for the UK,"Being a devoted Mac fan forced to work on a PC due to software constraints I was really excited to learn that Quickbooks was available in this format. I was unable to purchase it in the UK but quickly found it for sale in the US. Following installation I tried to open an existing Quickbooks (PC) file and discovered that this was not possible. I then spent a lot of time on forums, e-mailing Intuit and calling help lines trying to find out why. Bizarrely US and UK versions are incompatible and Intuit has no plans to release a UK version. PC and Mac versions of Quickbooks are also very reluctant to communicate with each other and a trial version is needed to bridge the gap. I wasted time and money in buying this product and wouldn't want others to make the same mistake."
5,Like hiring a part-time accountant,We wish we could have purchased this product sooner. We have become more organized in regards to our accounts.
2,Going Downhill,"I recently upgraded with this product from the Pro version of 1998 and in that time they gutted the power of the program requiring a subscription service to process payroll at a minimum of $25/mo when the user could do it before. This is a substantial cost impact for a small business with only a few employees (in my case, the payroll service would cost me $6.50 per paycheck!) Quickbooks makes big promises but is now segmenting their products so as to keep the revenue coming in and costing the small business more!"
2,Avoid If You Must Do Payroll,"The interface was not bad as I entered company information back to the beginning of our fiscal year. Then came the payroll entries. If you must do payroll, avoid this product! You cannot process payroll from within QBPro. You must either use the Quickbooks online service (and trust all of your employees' personal information to the nameless, faceless employees of a company somewhere in cyberspace) or use a stand alone payroll application from a third party developer that is a total piece of crap. I've been using a 12-year-old copy of MYOB that works great except that it does run on the new Macs. When we decided to ""upgrade"" to QBPro at the recommendation of our accountant, we had no idea of the level of frustration and disappointment that was in store. How can the premier small business accounting application not integrate payroll into the application?! What was Intuit thinking?!"
4,The Worse Battery,"DSC-P100 is my second Sony camera, I bough on june 20 2004 and the battery is damage with just 3 months used. Now I have to buy a new one."
4,good choice,"i was looking for a flat camera with optical zoom. this is it! okay, it's not cheap, but comparable cameras from cheaper companies than sony had some critical reviews in terms of picture quality, especially moving images. this is my second sony, and i am still very happy with it. 1 inch flat is like a pack of zigarettes, you can carry in your pocket without problem. and the zoom helps a lot if you cannot or do not want to get too close to your object...i carry the camera all the time, it's really fun. and the movie-optionus useful too. so you pay a little more, but you will not regret it."
1,DSC-P100 No Guarantees of Image Quality!,"I have a 10% success of getting a usable picture from this DSC P100 camera. Having read other reviews and web sites I can only agree that this camera is extremely sensitive to movement and as such you cannot guarantee getting that all important picture. I have been a digital camera user for 3 years now and this was my 3rd and non of the pictures are better than my 3 year old Fuji FinePix 4700. It is so hit and miss (mainly miss) that I am back to the market to get another digital camera. Very disappointed but I cannot live with the uncertainty, I need quality pictures every time!My advice if you want this camera is to be sure you buy it from a store whre you can return it with no questions, and then try it for yourself in real world situations and see if you are happy with it!"
3,Decent camera but...,"I bought the Sony Cybershot DSCP100 5.1 MP Camera after much researching on the internet about digital cameras because it was my first one.I like the size and shape of the camera. It can easily fit in a small purse or pocket, which is nice for the price.However the pictures turn out blurry unless in bright sunlight or with a flash, where I was previously not used to using one.I also took this camera on a long backpacking trip into the Grand Canyon and it must have gotten bumped, though i don't remember doing such, because now the zoom occassionally has issue coming in and out.Also I did not find the shutter lag to be very quick."
5,Part of our Sunday Morning Routine,"This video is a great introduction to a variety of math concepts as well as stretches and calisthenics. Both my 4-year-old and my 8-year-old enjoy the program from start to finish. The music is upbeat and the production quality is excellent. The video gives explanations and examples, and includes graphics for every concept presented. This video is a great antidote for passive glued-to-the tube ""learn while you watch"" DVDs."
5,Wake Up and Smell the Future,"Left brainers beware! Whatever you can do now, will be doable (more reliably) by a computer in the not too distant future and doable right now by countries at a lesser price. Here is what it comes down to: if you are mainly left brain competent and you do not distinguish yourself from your competition, your present and future clients and customers will treat you like a commodity and make their decisions to use or not use you based on price rather than value. Daniel Pink's book is a way to tell you to ""wake up and smell the future"" which belongs to those that can relate deeply to and with people. So get your interpersonal skills spiffed up or be relegated to the outsource heap. A great resource to help you with that is Keith Ferrazzi's book, ""Never Eat Alone."" And trust me, it you rely solely on your technical expertise to make it to retirement, you WILL be eating alone and without a job."
3,Don't they rule the present?,"This whole right-brain-left-brain thing is soooo left brain. Right brainers have no idea what the issue is about and perhaps it's better that way. But us left brainers have to sort and organize and categorize.... it's obsessive! The truth is that big-picture, extraverted, emotive people already are in the highest ranks of management. Check out our president. They may still be left-brained but far more right-brained than the lowly programmers and IT staffers. This is nothing new; while the techies labor long and hard to learn and problem solve, the right-brainers are smoozing and golfing their way up the corporate ladder. Now as to nurses and graphic artists ruling the world.... problem is these may be right brained jobs but the barriers to entry are low and so will be the salaries. An MFA may be the next MBA but it doesn't pay as well...."
3,"Cool L-Centered and R-Centered Brain concepts, but outdated","last edits were done in 2005, but much of the data taken from sources date back to 2002, 2003. That's simply too long ago to be relevant. None of the data reflect the Global Recession, or even the election of Obama. How do these new realities fit into the the Whole Mind paradigm?"
4,An Italian Emisphere,"I am italian and i read this book in summer 2007. There is no italian edition for this book so I read it in English. And by reading the book, and reading it in english, I understood something quite interesting:I came to the conclusion that I read faster English books than Italians. I have also realized that when you read a foreign language the Right emisphere is much more involved because even if you don't know some specific words, you give much more importance to the context and to what the author is meaning. It' s bad when I miss a word in Italian and i feel the need to go back and read exactly every words in the period. That' s never happens when I read English. It would be a good example on the two emisphers' complementary.For sure, one of the best book I have ever read!Grazie Dan!nik"
3,A whole new mind- half done,"I like the evolutionary premise of this book; however, the case is half baked. The value of information brokers does seem to be reducing or is it just finding a new, more distributed level? Communications networks have made information globally available to everyone. It seems reasonable that the new value is using this information creatively. But, the author does not make a convincing case. Or as I think about it; a logical case {which is a left brain trait}.I'm glad I read the book but it didn't charge me up to paint or sculpt."
3,"Strong in concept and observation, weak in evidence.","Mr. Pink's observation on the skill necessary today seems to be great and timely. Probably every person working in industry has been feeling the same idea as described in this book. However, nobody has ever written so clearly expressed such an idea. The author insists his idea very strongly while the evidences he raises are not so pursuasive. Reading only the first chapter is enough."
1,I'd like to know just where is this Right Brain Utopia,"Wow, things sure sound great in Pink's extravagantly affluent utopia of right brainers! Can I come and play, too?I read that he hails from Northern Virginia someplace...sounds like he's one of those Beltway Bandits sucking at the U.S. Federal Government teat?? I see from the copyright date that this magazine article-cum-""book"" was authored during the height of those no-bid contracts doled out to the Bush-Cheney lackeys pushing their ""war"" in Iraq. One good fantasy deserves another, as evidenced in this ""book"".I think this Mr. Pink should take a short 4-hour drive down here to Norfolk Virginia and see what it's like to have to survive in the Real World."
3,See Hwung's April 5 Review,"John Hwung's review is spot-on, to my thinking. To sell books one has to frame movements as radical shifts where the old is out and the new is in. (Pink did, thankfully, avoid the phrase ""paradigm shift."") Now someone needs to write about ""The Amalgamated Economy,"" wherein the essential elements of the Agricultural, Industrial, Information and Conceptual Ages blend to make for a healthy global economy. No nation will long survive if significant numbers of people try to make a living designing toilet bowl brushes."
2,"Mildly interesting, but little depth and value.","The Strenght Based concept is interesting. Psychobabble, but interesting. If your company is implementing this strategy, then by all means get this book and read it. Otherwise, it isn't worth it. A little self reflection will do the trick."
4,Summer Book Study for Teachers,"Perhaps I read this book with a whole new mind but I took away lots of new and somewhat random information from this book: The combination of automation, abundanc, and Asia has been a death-knoll for American industry. We must change the way we prepare children for the future to teach the new important qualities including play, story, empathy, symphony, and design. Most effective leaders are funny. IQ accounts for less than ten percent of career success. Other important facts are imagination, joyfulness, and social dexterity. Design is ""utility enhanced by significance."" The four basics of effective design are contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. Choose things, we are urged now, because they delight you not simply because they are functional. Stories are easier to remember because stories are how we remember. We believe that stories amuse and facts illuminate, but this is not true. Symphony is seeing how everything works together to make a whole."
3,Maybe I'm too L-Brained too appreciate this book fully,I am feeling great!You may be smarter than meBut I'm creative!
4,Good movie,"This is a very good classic movie about a 'love triangle' that happens in a circus. However, the dvd doesn't have scene selection feature. Ken"
1,Disk failed to work,"This disk failed to work on any of my DVD players...I took a gamble and lost. The covet was nice at least...I sent a letter, but never got a reply...I won't be shopping from this dealer again. They need the money more than me evidently."
2,"Please, improve your information!!!","I must complain about the Amazon information lately. What happened? I'm a regular customer, but I wouldn't buy TRAPEZE unless you tell me more about it. What is ""Format: NTSC"". I remember that Amazon used to inform in that item: ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN, COLOR, 2:35, etc., not to mention about subtitles or anything like that. I won't buy any product without knowing what's in it, like special features, digital transfer, soundtrack remastered, behind-the-scenes documentary or audio commentaries. It's all you expect to find in a new DVD, specially an MGM original from a United Artists production. I can't buy TRAPEZE to find a poor letterbox version (not anamorphic widescreen enhanced for 16:9 television sets) like other MGM releases. Please: I NEED TO KNOW MORE DETAILS."
3,"Great ideas, need further instruction","I like the thought behind these exercises and this book, but I thought it needed more instruction. Some of this stuff I had never heard of and it's hard to learn something and teach your horse at the same time."
3,instructions,i found this book to help with an organized training workout but expected to find more instructions on getting the horse to perform the movements
2,I didn't care for this book,"I used this book in an introductory astronomy course in college. I found it difficult to follow the text - not because of poor comprehension, but it was just written really poorly. I much prefer Bennett's Cosmic Perspective."
1,Poor product,"This tray was very unstable. In addition it had three tray positionsnone of which would lay flat. I hate to say this but this tray is ""junk""and I ended up putting it out to the trash. Sorry, but that is the way it is."
1,Returning Item,"Returning item. I have other Table Mate II trays and was not paying attention when ordered. These are flimsy and the arm to hold won't stay in, falls easily."
3,Quality of Product,"I think this product is made by the same company that made another one, purchased a long time ago. It is not near the same quality of the first one I purchased. This is much lighter and not as sturdy as my other one. I recommend this for use, but wish the company had used the same materials as before. This is true with many things we purchase today. We are not getting our money's worth as we did before and really should not let it be that way."
1,Amazon should stop representing SOJITEC because of inferior products,"Very disappointed in product design and quality decline. I had purchased this product about 3 years ago from Bed, Bath and Beyond, but they have since discontinued its offering. I suspect I've found the reason why. A side by side comparison of the recently purchased Table-Mate II Classic Adjustable TV tray with a previously purchased tray of the exact same description and brand shows the new product to be less stable because the materials, both plastic tray and metal legs, have been made from much thinner materials and reduced diameter tubing and support brace, with poorer quality finishing. Additionally one of the plastic end tube covers on one of the legs (non-structural piece) arrived completely split. Since this product now comes from China, it appears quality has been sacrificed for cost (or profit, since the purchase price is similar). I would have paid more for a better match to my existing product."
3,Ehh? Unclear and Complex Rule System...,"I have been playing RPG's for about 5 years now, and have played everything from Dungeons and Dragons to D20 Modern...and this really doesn't make much sense. The rules, while short and sweet; are really complex about something with energy and stones and white and reds stones. I am still going to be playing it but it is not as good as D&D or other games...plus, I kind of isn't fair to be playing a ... SUPERHERO in an RPG (its like playing a God in Dungeons and Dragons!) Over all it is worth it for the money, but unless you just want an RPG to {mess} around with then this is your game."
3,Lack of specificity is both strength and weakness,"MURPG has its strengths, foremost among them ease of play. However, there is very little differentiation between characters of approximate strength and/or ability (as already mentioned).MURPG does have one significant strength that its developers may have overlooked. Because it focuses on recource allocation, it is excellent for online play (no fudging of die rolls). In the online groups in which I participate, the focus is more on the cinematic nature of the game, rather than the mechanics itself. Its simplicity allows the players a great deal of freedom, and allows for a load of fun.I recommend this system for novice roleplayers, or players wishing for a quick & easy system of not-so-serious roleplaying."
3,Too narrow of focus and too slim on content,"The book is thinner than I expected/hoped (guess I should have checked the page count) and has only seven pages of source material for the massive marvel world. There is absolutely no support from Marvel and only two sourcebooks ever published, so that's huge in my opinion. Most of the book is dedicated to the system. You can however find descriptions of 40 heroes and villains from the marvel universe which is nice but brief.Also, the system is too narrowly focused for me because the range of abilities goes from 1 to 10 leaving very little room for the awesome range of ability that should exist in the marvel universe.That it is more free form and somewhat simpler than many RPGs may appeal to some people and the game is presented as though you are writing your own comic which has a nice sense of style."
4,death metal masterpiece,"I don't know about the applesauce dude above, but we musn't make fun of the retarted. Anyway on to the review. This necrophagia cd rocks from beginning to end. I have been listening to a lot of black/death metal lately, and these dudes are american, and let me tell you--the Scandinavians don't have a patent on extreme metal. A very varied cd, with death metal, mixed with dare I say-- kind of a progressive bent to it. I love progressive so this is all right with me. Get this cd if you love metal; you won't be disappointed."
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!!!,"I JUST RECEIVED THIS BOOK ""DATE SMART!"" IN THE MAIL THIS WEEKEND AFTER HEARING SO MUCH ABOUT IT ON A LOCAL RADIO STATION. I CAN'T PUT IT DOWN!!!! ALMOST EVERYTHING IN THAT BOOK I CAN RELATE TO. I WAS LOOKING FOR A GOOD RELATIONSHIP BOOK AND THIS ONE RANKS EXCELLENT!!!!!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!"
3,IM not a professional but I know Interpersonal Communication ---SAF,I have studied Interpersonal communication while i was in college for the part four years Iwas in college and this book provides only a handful of researched advice( which they did not cite) and the rest is just opinion and stereotype. People DO NOT Take this book seriously.
5,Seventy six years old ad still making sawdust,"My experience with wood working projects began in 1958 when I was pastoring my first church. The congregation met in what used to be a drug store. It needed lots of repairs and I had only a few hand tools.Much has happened since that humble beginning. I am now retired and have time to work in my shop full of great tools.I discovered the Kreg pocket hole jig at an enormous tool promotion display. I was immediately intrigued by it's simplicity and the incredible results. I couldn't believe it was going to be so simple to make really strong joints and make them quickly. Well that was about 12 or 15 years ago, and I'm still using my first kreg jig, but have recently bought the new K3 master pocket jig system and boy am I thrilled with the results."
4,Easiest joints possible.,"If you're looking for a fast, easy way to make a joint this is it. It doesn't have the strength or aesthetics of the more complicated joints but in the right situations it is extremely easy to do. A complete box frame or face frame can be made in a matter of minutes instead of hours.Update: I've been using this for over 3 years now and still love it!!! I've found it can be used where it can be difficult to make a joint. An example is an octagon frame where the back couldn't be seen. The pocket screws make rock solid joints at each miter. Hundreds of joints and everything still works great."
4,Solid Preparation Software - Practice Tests Too Tough,"The software (CD) provides solid preparation for all sections of the test. The mini tests for each section are very good, but the full length practice tests are much tougher than the real thing. That's better than the opposite though. I scored a 570 on the Kaplan Practice and a 750 on the real thing."
4,Very appealing,"It's almost impressive when a song is just about strictly better than the remixes made of it. Both songs offered here, ""Love Declaration"" featuring Aaradhna, and ""It's Not Me It's You"" featuring Ngaiire, are stronger in their original ""Single Mix""es, than Mr. Timothy, the Presets, or the Rogue Traders can manage. While the mixes do present the songs in a new light, I find myself falling back on the originals for an appealing and original listen. Don't pass this one by!"
2,Not THAT great,"We bought this seat for our daughter when she outgrew the Britax Roundabout. We mainly purchased this based on the features and the price being less than the Britax booster seat. My daughter who is now 4 really does not like this seat. She is always complaining that she is uncomfortable. We still use the 5 point harness and the straps are continually a struggle because they become twisted so easily.This seat is also not good if you need to attach to a car/plane with a seat belt. The seat belt buckle always seems to fall right in the middle of the seat, and there is no padding there. So the buckle is right in the small of her back.We are going to replace this seat with something else very soon."
5,Destroyed herself and her family,What a shame that Renee thought murder was the only answer for her selfish lying ways. Murdering a wonderful husband who forgave her enough times for cheating and lying and loved her so much. A great man who was always there for her and would do anything for her. Now he is dead. Read the book .
5,Great true crime read,"Dale Hudson writes a winner! This is a very well written true crime book on a woman leaving a double life, whose husband tries to give her all, and she has him murdered due to an affair she is having. You won't be able to put it down!"
4,Better than others on the market for under $200,"This is a pretty good set. Hubby had a hard time putting it together, probably 4 hours of work. The holes are in incorrect places, so he had to make new holes for the screws and file other parts to get the screws to go in properly. Try to put the stickers on as you get it together. Especially before the knobs go on. Hubby had to cut the stickers and piece them back together around the knobs. Grill sound effects scared our 3 yr old daughter. She really doesn't like that part. But, she loves all of the doors to open, pouring coffee and the sounds on the main kitchen side. The little table and bench on the grill side is cute too. We would buy this again, but put it together differently. Read the instructions first completely!!! Then go back step by step and put it together to make sure everything makes sense. Little Tikes really needs to rethink/rewrite their instructions. Otherwise, she likes it for the 2 days she's had it!"
1,I wish I had listened to the reviews,"I received the kitchen from Little Tikes and it was missing the instructions,the screws, the stickers, the pots and pan, the cups, the plates, the oven door, and the dishwasher door. I kept looking in the box hoping for a miracle. UNbelievable. I was in shock. I called customer service and they could care less. They were not rude but they were indifferent. They will send me replacements in 7-10 business days. It must happen all of the time. So here I am with a whining, crying three-year-old who cannot play with this $[...] toy. Try hiding this large toy so that he will not see it and want to play with it. NEVER AGAIN. Where is the quality control? I am so mad. I wish I had listened to the other customers."
2,Very Disappointed,"We purchased this kitchen for our 1 1/2 year old daughter. We looked around at other sets but decided on this one. If the doors weren't screwed shut and we were able to open them at the store, we wouldn't have made the purchase. The storage space is extremely small, barely holds anything. They are narrow and the doors don't shut properly. Our daughter is a climber so she would open the oven doors and step up to climb up and through the window (after she pulled the flowers out), be careful of this. The thing that she did love was the grill and the way it sounds and lights up. She also loved the coffee pot, and how the coffee would ""disappear"" when poured. We would give the grill and overall appearance of the kitchen 5 stars but ultimately, it wasn't just the appearance of the kitchen we were after so we returned it. We are currently on the hunt for a kitchen set with cabinets where she can actually put some dishes and ""food"" in."
4,.24 dpi not acceptable? don't know what he is talking about?,"I don't personally own this monitor, I have seen it, and it is an impressive monitor. The person who rated this monitor so poorly down there who said that .24 dpi is not acceptable obviously is missing some details, because I've always heard that the human eye doesn't distinguish between anything less than .25dpi....I have heard similar complaints about customer service from owner's of Sony monitors on other websites, so if by chance your monitor does have a problem, you may be without a monitor for a couple weeks while sony fixes it....."
2,Not durable. Mattel not what it used to be.,"This toy, like several other Mattel toys I've purchased in the past 5 years are difficult to put together, troublesome to play with, and not durable. I wish Mattel would think more about the kids playing with their toys and less about the stockbrokers. Toys can be easy to assemble. Intuitive to play with and rugged as a tank. It just depends on priorities of the toy design/builder."
4,Son loves it.,"My son has loved matchbox and hot wheels since the age of 2. He is now almost 7, has had this carwash for a while and still plays with it. The sponges come off, but you can put them back on, no biggie. It's very durable as is most matchbox playsets. I know this b/c I have bought my son many hot wheels products to be disapointed. We purposefully buy matchbox sets and this one has yet to disapoint. yes the carwash itself is ""clicky"" sounding, but it's a toy. Lots of toys make noises, they aren't for us, there for the kids. I would recommend this toy to any little or big guy who plays with matchbox or hotwheels cars."
5,good news for fixing ordinary mending problems,"This little book had a warm welcome for the newly graduated independent livers. The diagrams and text make simple clothing repairs manageable when mother or grandmother are not available to a plea for fixing the zipper or mending that pocket or tacking up a hem. I gave it for Christmas, and two grandchildren loved it as they undertook living on their own and working. I was able to find this little marvel only at Amazon, new, and reasonably priced"
2,Not for everybody,"This boots are not for every feet, at least not for mine (which I always have seen quite normal). I got two pairs of beeswax in 8,5us and in 9,5us, which should cover the span of length where my feet are, and both pairs are hurting the top of my feet. Precisely the area between the toe box and the vamp, where the leather bends. I believe I am past the break in period since I have been wearing the two pairs for over a month. I can only rate these boots as uncomfortable."
5,Unbelieveable,"Got a great product, at a FANTASTIC PRICE, and with quick service. One of the best deals I have gotten in a very long time!!"
2,Meh...,"So I got this for a cosplay of mine to make an illusion that I have a set of sharp teeth. However, when I got this package shipping wasn't bad though ), the liquid was waxy and difficult to apply. There was barely any there! It was cheap, but I don't recommend buying it because it's a waste of money and your time. I don't know if this happened to other people, but ugh, it was very annoying and frustrating to use. If you're buying this for a little kid for a one time use, that would be fine. However, if you're planning on using it on cosplay multiple times DO NOT buy this. I recommend trying Wet n Wild H2O Proof Liquid Eyeliner, Ultra Black 881. Yeah, it's eyeliner but it works SO much better than this stuff. If you're not comfortable putting EYELINER in your mouth, then research other tooth black items. Good luck! :D"
3,I don't always wake up!!,"I got this alarm a couple years ago and now I'm using it in college. Unfortunately, I have had some incidents in over sleeping because the alarm wasn't loud enough and this was costly - academically. For people out in the market for a loud alarm clock, I personally wouldn't recommend this one."
2,horrible!,"I recieved a this clock as a gift. it was blue though. the alarm was horrible all it gave was a beeping sound that gradually got louder. it never woke me up. the other choice of alarm was to be woken up my a loud radio. that sometimes worked but it was very annoying. after about a year of use the alarm stopped working and wouldnt go off at all. i ended up throwing it in the garbage where it belongs. the stero on it was horrible as well, but with no antenna, what else do you expect? i think there was a cords that hung from the back and acted as an antenna but it was useless. if you need an alarm clock to wake up early in the morning for work, id advise to stay clear of this one."
3,Jell-o No Bake Cheesecake,"I love Jell-o No Bake Cheesecake but was disappointed the shelf life was so short. I got it after Christmas and the expiration date was April 8,2011. Had I known that before I ordered I would have never ordered. 12 boxes is a lot to use up in only 3 months. I will not order again."
5,"The best 3D, first person shooter ever","Combining atmosphere and a realistic feel with hard hitting action is exactly what the films (especially Aliens) associated with this game do so much to their credit. Aliens Vs. Predator is a game which perfectly reflects this. It is like playing a film, but being in it, experiencing it, living it. Nothing on the worldwide computer games market even comes close to challenging this game's atmosphere. The deathmatch play is also superb because each creature has different strengths and weaknesses and these make battles, especially with 3 or more players using the 8-player-capable system, intensely tactical, interesting, exciting and often frightening. Aliens Vs. Predator is a masterwork of computer gaming"
4,A must for Piano students to listen,"My piano teacher comes from the European school and required me to hear Egon Petri's style to give me a better idea of what she expects from me. The recording was made in 1954, using the best tape equipment available at that time. Yet, I could tell that Petri's performance was awesome. I recommend it."
5,Incredibly Comfortable!,"Love this hammock and doubt that the price can get much better. I bought this just to test out a hammock in the backyard, fully intending to replace it with a ""better"" unit once I made sure the space was right. No need for an upgrade! I ended up purchasing hammock straps, as the ropes that came with the hammock were pretty flimsy, but still ended up investing less than $30 overall. Great value and VERY comfortable!"
4,great gift,"This was a father's day gift, and the feedback has been that it was easy to set up and works amazingly. It arrived quickly, all the way out to a small town in South Dakota."
4,WhooHoo,"Hold on people don't waste your money on the other products, this one will definitely make you happy. Well worth a try for the price, I mean go check em out else where...Seriously me and my two kids enjoy this every sunny southern weekend"
1,Cheap - strings ripped,This hammock is cheap - poor quality. The fabric is nice enough but the construction of the ends is not. It started to fall apart after the first week of use on a camping trip.
3,"Small, small, small","The good things: price, comes with rope to tie up, packs up small.The bad thing: the hammock says it is rated for 300 lb, but it could not hold a person weighing more than 150 pounds. It just isn't wide enough. Also, you can not sit on it and lean back. It works more like a stool, because it is so narrow."
3,"OK, 3-1/2 stars. Certainly good for the price.","This hammock has a pretty color scheme, mostly blue with white and lime green stripes. I find it comfortable enough, though without spreaders the fabric tends to envelope you like a cocoon. The first hammock I got had some cords unraveling at one end so I got a replacement. The second hammock which I kept had the cords all twisted up and impossible for me to straighten out--doesn't compromise the strength but not neat to look at. All in all, a good deal for the money and I'm enjoying it."
1,Don't waste your money,"I am 5'10"" 205lbs and barely fit in this hammock. The hammock is not long enough and I barely fit inside. Only good for kids."
5,Beautiful hammock,"The shipping was really fast .i am super happy with the quality of the hammock ,worth the price! Fabric feels good ,like a dry cotton . The hammock itself comes in an extra bag to travel with ,it's nice ,small and compact ,once folded up.Holds easily me and my son and my puppy dog.but fairly narrow hammock !Beautiful pattern and when wet it really dries up fast"
4,Good Stuff,"I like these type of biographical shows. This I like even more because I truly respect the individual that it's about. It does cover most of Trump's early achievements up to the mid 90's, shame it doesn't have information about his more recent conquests, like the apprentice and other more recent projects. It's a good watch."
4,Bath toy for older child,"My 5-yr old is tired of her old bath toys and constantly asks to bring non-bath-appropriate toys in with her. I saw these in the store in the swim/pool section and it seemed perfect. Very girlie, she's quite happy with the one and is saving her money to buy a second."
3,"Sturdy, but....","I bought this stand because it was the one recommended on the box of a hammock I was given.Imagine my surprise when I could not connect the hammock to the frame without using length of rope to extend the chain. Not sure if I was a damsel in distress who needed a strong knight in armor to help -- or if I just needed a couple of extra links or short springs.As it is I am not sure whether my overweight friends are safe or not. And that rope is stretching! There were no instructions for attaching the hammock, so I may have missed something..."
2,Difficult Straps,I own a Roundabout and love it. We decided to buy a Decathalon so my daughter could stay in it longer. It's beautiful and plush however we are extremely disappointed with it. The straps are difficult to tighten down and release. My daughter has been stuck in it on several occasions while the straps were stuck. You must push the button in extremely hard to get them to release. Sometimes the straps will not tighten down all the way. I have to pull so hard to get them to tighten down that I have marks on my hands. Other reviewers have had the same complaint so I know it's not a strength issue. Please make sure to check this out if you decide to buy this model. Even the store I purchased it from now tells me they know of the issue. I just hope they are passing on the info to new customers. I am so concerned about my daughters safety that I will not use the seat.
3,"Satisfied, but did not meet my expectations","I have a two and a half yr old son. In my car I had purchased the Britax Roundabout and have used it for the last year and a half. I love the roundabout! Can't say enough about it. I recently purchased the Britax Decathalon for my husband's car and had high expectations for the seat. Although I think that it is a good seat, I am not as happy as with the roundabout. My son's head tilts forward when he sleeps, even after I removed all the body cushions and extras that the car seat has. We tried the reclined position, but the recline angle doesn't look as reclined as the roundabout, and the recline hasn't been that much help. Furthermore, the base of the seat is so high that my son needs asistance climbing up. We also had a GRACO, and overall it is a very good seat. If you are in the position where you need to change the carseat b/c of your child's height or weight, I would strongly recommend that for the money the Decathalon costs, get the GRACO instead."
3,"Looks great, at least!","Not the easiest install in my Jeep Grand Cherokee. My husband is near 7 feet tall and won't be able to drive the car till we can turn the seat to forward facing. Until then, I drive and baby seems comfortable so far. Pattern looks great. Straps don't tangle, which is nice. Overall though, nothing special for the money in our opinion. Thought we'd take a chance and see what $290 buys since we bought a less expensive seat for our son. Our advice, find something else to splurge on."
5,Comfy and easy to install,"I just put this in the car today, very easy to install, unlike our infant car seat. It's big and very sturdy. The fabric is much nicer than pictured - taupe with teal kinda mod plush and soft. The baby insert seems very well put together and you can change/remoce pieces to custom fit your cutie. Seems significantly ""more"" seat than the other britax. This may not fit a smaller car as it takes up alot of room in my smaller SUV. Hallie was hanging out in it on our table prior to installation and seemed very comfortable in this."
3,Shameful Legacy,Shameful Legacy: Quite an accurate description of Lahore and Hera Mandi. This phenomina is a shameful legacy of Mughal and Sikh raj in Lahore.
3,Not for beginners,My only comment is the fact that this book is not for beginners. The title is very misleading. In the preface it is described as a book for a second or third year student.
4,I remember this.....,"This is one of those films you were to sit through in class because it's to teach you something. Well, I don't remember what I learned, but I remember it brought me to tears at the time. I, unfortunately haven't seen the older version, but this one is well acted and sincere in its story-telling. You will enjoy it. I promise."
4,promising,"Hopewell is another band that has famously had some contact with Mercury Rev and Dave Fridmann. Jason Russo used to play in Mercury Rev, and has moved on. And this is pretty cool. ""Calcutta' is pretty simple rock. Some songs like ""Praise Twice"" recalls late 1960s blues like Cream. Other songs like ""Sugar In The Honey"" and ""Synthetic Symphony"" show obvious signs that Russo was in Mercury Rev at some time. This is definitely one of the most promising records this year. It is dramatic epic rock that can be quiet and quite hard sounding. All the twelve songs are imaginative and very striking. Hopewell is a band to check out. I wish that I could see them live very soon. My life would be enriched. This is piano based music that definitely is worth listening to. Hopewell is the band of the future. They are definitely a cool new band with some funky influences."
2,worse movie ever!,"this series is all messed up. Michal Landon jr. is the worse filmaker in the world!. in the book Belinda was at a home in boston were she meets drew,she hasn't seen him for years. Jannete Oke wrote four more books about Belinda and drew's kids. this movies are so messed up, watch movies 1-3 but don't waste your time on this movie. READ THE BOOKS! PLEASEEEEEE!and anthor thing is that belinda is clark and marty's child"
5,A must for any music lover !!,"I have been an LBC fan for 2 1/2 years now, and I can't imagine not having their music coming out of my stereo speakers!! Commitment is a tremendous album with something that many albums today lack...SOUL!!!!! Just listening to their music gives you a chill. Between the lyrics and style changes, you will never get sick of LBC. I THINK COMMITMENT WILL PUT LBC ON THE NATIONAL STAGE IN A BIG WAY!!!"
5,PERFECT! My daughter loves it!!,"My daughter just turned 5 and she got this for her birthday. She LOVES it! It was easy to set up and transfer music (instructions were helpful and easy to read). Very easy to turn up/down volume and switch back and forth to different songs. She always liked to use my iPod, but it was too difficult for her. This Barbie Girls MP3 player is going to be a hit with many, many girls! My daughter is still alittle young to go online to the Barbie Girls website, but older girls will love that too!"
5,Barbie Girls MP3 Player - Gold,"Barbie Girls MP3 Player - Gold, excellent mp3 and very amusing for my 5 year-old daughter and for me also, I recommend it it is spectacular and he/she has very good sound"
1,Never received carring case,I am reviewing this product very low since I never got the item and no one at Amazon seems to care. I'll bet it is functional and useful but until receive it I won't know.
5,Works great,"Excellent shower head replacement. Has numerous settings, and works great. No complaints I recommend the product and supplier. Great value."
1,It's ok for the price,"I wouln't suggest any one to buy from this seller, this product suppose to have sofrware, it was not in the package. No good to buy product without software. Please make sure you get the software when you buy from the seller"
3,Not all it was...,"Just discovered that the extensive interview with Victor Anderson that appeared in the original edition (_People of the Earth_) has been cut from _Being a Pagan_. Disappointing, to say the least!"
4,Great collection of colonization stories,"When we think of humans exploring and colonizing outer space, each of us has his or her own ideas about what it might be like. This collection of thirteen stories gives some very different perspectives from some top-notch writers.Some of the entries are better than others, to be sure, but none of them is bad. Even if you find one not to your taste, it's short enough that you don't have to put up with it for very long.One advantage to this sort of book is that it can give an introduction to a writer with whom you may be unfamiliar--and it's a lot cheaper to buy a collection like this than it is to buy 13 separate novels!"
4,Great Book,"This is a good book for the beginner or full time sea glass collector. It tells about the different pieces of glass and antique shards you are likely to find on the beach along with the regular broken bottle pieces. It shows some beautiful pieces the writer has found with great pictures to go with it. The writer also described the history of the pieces. Some examples of pieces found were Fiesta ware, old clay pipes, frozen charlottes, Blue Willow, ABC pottery, Mocha ware, and glass stoppers to name a few. I bought this book not knowing what it was about and was very pleasantly surprised!"
1,Tabletop Fountains: 40 Easy and Great-Looking Projects to M,Don't waste your money on this book. Most of the fountains displayed are either very tacky or have very minimal water action. I was very disappointed with this book.
3,Goes down at full speed of 54 Mbps,"While this router has a much better range than my previous Netgear, it has a number of issues itself. For one, when I transfer large files between 2 computers at a full 54 Mbps speed, the router reboots by itself after only several minutes. So I have to throttle speed down to 11 Mbps. I reported this problem to Buffalo, but they claimed that it was a hardware problem. So they replaced it free and, of course, the new router is showing exactly the same symptoms. I've had this router for almost a year, and Buffalo is yet to make a firmware update (there's is actually none to download from their website). From my experience with other larger brandnames, these updates get released once every several months."
2,Not for climbers,My 8 month old loves this toy. Sadly I do not. It's just right for him to push up to any piece of furniture and use it as a ladder to get into all sorts of trouble. Plus even though he's only 16 lbs it flips over if he stands on top while holding the handle.I'm sure it'd be perfect if your child isn't inventive because on the rare moments he actually uses it to practice walking it works great. But sadly my child prefers to explore the heights.
1,Dangerous toy DO NOT BUY,I saw this toy at a friend's place and bought it for my then 11 month old daughter. She was just starting to walk. She loved this toy and loved pushing it around but one day the handle slipped from her hand and she fell head on on the hard wood floor and had a seizure. We ended up in the hospital. I think this toy and other walkers are very dangerous for toddlers especially ones who are just starting to walk. The pediatrician at the hospital told us that walkers are not good for little kids. Also the wooden blocks are too heavy. If your child thraws it at another child or at you it may do serious harm.
1,Too Dangerous,"My daughter started walking at 10 months and got this toy for her birthday. I was very excited about it - beads on the wire + blocks + push-toy = wonderful, right? WRONG! The second day she used it, she climbed right up the front and leaned over the handle, falling flat on her face. So I took off the handles so she could lean over and push it. She still climbed on top of the lids and the wheels moved under her and she fell flat on her face again. So I took the lids off too (not easy, by the way). Then she climbed on top of the hard, wooden blocks and the same result. I took the hard blocks out and it is now and empty toy for her to push around. It is awful that I've had to destroy this toy to make it safe for my toddler to play with."
2,VERY Disapointed!,"We are VERY disappointed with this walker. We generally love Parents toys, because they are well made and durable.We bought this for our daughter when she was about 11 months and on the verge of walking to help her get around - a BIG mistake. The walker has no breaks, or the way to slow it down, so she gave up very quickly to try and walk with it. Also, there are these hard rubber pieces next to the back wheels, which are very painful to step on. I made a mistake once, and ended up with a bloody instep.Next, almost immediately, the paint started to melt off of the wooden block. Melt off, and it's about 70 degrees in our house at all times. Not to mention that these blocks are simply too hard for little kids. I like the rounded edges, but my daughter had trouble picking it up until recently.Last but not least, the sturdy quality which we like with Parents toys is just not there. In addition to paint melting, the push-bar is not coming off.Very, very disappointing."
5,One of the essentials,"A welcome upgrade to a classic. Thoroughly modern interface which is now Mac friendly. Exceptional scholarship and an essential for all those needing definitive answers regarding how to use Spanish language properly. An excellent tool for students looking to improve their language skills, the Diccionario de uso del espanol by Moliner especially provides writers, linguists, translators, and other professionals an outstanding reference work that will prove to be indispensable. A must-have and highly recommended."
5,Wonderful book........spectacular story......,"This book was purchased for my 12 year old daughter, but before giving it to her, I decided to read it. It is written in such a fashion that it kept my mind intrigued with every page. I love the way it is told through the mind of a child, but with such passion and depth that an adult can appreciate it. As I neared the end of the book, I simply could not put it down! I look forward to hearing my daughters' comments now that she has started reading it. I will definitely buy the next book published."
5,Ireland pretty Interesting,Some very pretty scenes of country side. A little history and a lot of folk lore. Really enjoyed this rental. I've seen many and this one gives a nice warm experience of the country. I'd watch this one again.
2,Serves purpose but not comfortable...,"It does work well, but wasn't as low cut in the back as shown in the picture. Also I found it to be very itchy around the top. Would not buy another one."
2,"Decent book, IE biased, suspicious reviews","An ok book, but not 5-star. IE5's XML implementation is not pure and the book covers the IE5 implementation. How does a book get 4 5-star rating before its available?"
4,It's Better than Most,"This is the fourth XML book I have purchased and it is by far the best in explaining concepts so a relative neophyte can understand.The book is well-structured and the authors get to the point without having to back-track like the author of ""Presenting XML"" did, repeatedly. They also cover in some detail, multiple scripting languages.However, this book - as with all others - have superficial examples. Every author develops mailing or phone lists for their examples. No one gives an example using purchase orders or invoices - things that we will drive the expansion of XML.This is a good book for a beginner and anyone just getting exposed to XML. For a more sophisticated users, it probably won't be of much help. Perhaps the ""Toolkit for Programmers"" is a bit misleading.This gets 3 stars for its quality plus an additional bonus star for being the best book I have seen so far."
4,Spoon rest,Spoon rest was what I needed. Note: couldn't tell if it was white or cream from the picture. Would like to have had that information noted in the description.
5,Best DVD on Marbling,Peggy is an American Treasure. She shares with you the basics and the details.You will gain insights that would take you years to learn on your own. That is why some used copies of this DVD sell for 200.00Please wait AS i KNOW THEY ARE PRODUCING SOME MORE.Peggy is also looking at a kindle guide to Marbling in Manual form which I hope she does.How to make paints alone is worth the price of this DVD which I didntcheck time but must be over 1 1/2 hours long. She explains how to use concentrated pigments to get the brighter colors Marblers are looking for .This is a must have .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
4,Bullseye Auto-Leveling Laser,The leveler was great. It worked fantastic with installing some bay rods. It was just what the novice carpenter called for. Thank you!@
3,just ok,"While this product was effective in completing the projects I needed to have done, It was hard to read the leveling device to adequately make sure the beam was straight."
4,pretty cool item,it's a pretty cool tool once you get it down. the only thing i dont like is the fact it leaves a hole in the wall every time. but beyond that it pretty cool
4,The first modern study of these South African succulents.,Mr. van Jaarsveld has done all succulent lovers a great service by doing the botanical study and work necessary to present this modern taxonomic understanding of Gasterias.
4,wedding rings,"I have heard lots of things about these rings most good, but I am the kind of person that I have to see for myself and we ordered the rings and we love them. Great fit and feel. Thank you very much."
4,definitely one of Sandlers better films.,"im a huge fan of Adam Sandler. I went to see this film with a bunch of friends over the summer. It's one of the best movies I have seen from Sandler in a long time.. Don't get me wrong, I love most of his films, but this one was different. It wasn't a comedy.. it was powerful.I think this film really shows a side of Sandler that needed to be seen. He's an amazing actor, and he pulled off his character in this film perfectly.this is a must see for everyone!remember, bring the tissues!"
2,"wow, what a waste of time","I read all these great reviews so was ready for this movie. What I wasn't ready for was how inane and boring it is. And that music that keeps playing whenever Adam Sandler is riding on his segue, or scooter, or whatever it is! It wants to be a feel-good movie, but in the end, you're left scratching your head and thinking...'did I really waste a whole evening on this drivel?' How this movie got so many stars is truly a mystery. The only saving grace was seeing New York city."
2,A perfect bummer of a movie,"Now, who would watch this, really? A former dentist whose family was killed on 9/11 suffers from PTS while Don Cheadle tries to snap him out of it for two hours. There are no laughs, but, strangely, there are no tears here either. It's just an unrelenting downer, though it does have a somewhat Hollywood ending. Sandler's mumbling gets annoying, and when he tries to commit suicide by cop, he still ends up free, which probably would never happen in real life. Watch this if you want to be bummed out for two hours."
1,Totally fail,This action figure is a totally fail I really hated my self for buying this stupid toy & how did I spend 24.98$?Any how I give it one star & it's only deserve maximum 4.98$.Thank you all for readin my review
2,Annoying Beep,"Super annoying beeping that you could not turn off, until I disassembled the product and snipped cables inside to turn it off, it worked well until it died just a few months after I got it. Waste of money."
4,Very nice cuppa green...,"This green tea by Stash, just might be one of the best ways to get your jasmine tea fix, and your antioxidants, to boot. The scent of jasmine blossoms comes through very nicely. You can actually enjoy this tea without any sugar, though I still prefer a little bit. There were no discernible aftertastes and I'd say the caffeine kick was light. I'd certainly buy this tea again and again...pass the crab rangoons, please!"
4,Pretty good,"I've had to cut back on coffee, and my doctor suggested I try green tea. I've tried many versions of green tea, and Stash Mangosteen is the most palatable I've found. I know...it's not coffee, but it smells wonderful and tastes pleasant."
4,Very good for what it is,"We've been ""product testing"" a variety of green teas in our office. So far the Stash green has been the most favorably received, just ahead of the Yamamoto-yama ""Sushi Bar"" tea. Stash won out due to the fact that it's got a distinctive green tea ""taste"" and seems resistant to bitterness from oversteeping. ""Sushi Bar""-like some others-tended to be a little weak. Other rejected greens veered to the other end of the spectrum were overly bitter if you so much as looked at them wrong.As described, it is slightly sweet and nutty. The description also states that this green tea is imported from Brazil. That might be a bit off-putting at first. However, it's idiot-proof and, like the title alludes to, this is teabag tea and for that, the Stash is very good stuff."
4,Great Tea,"I recently dropped coffee for tea. I bought some Moroccan mint to compliment my Stash double bergamot. The Moroccan mint wasn't exactly what I thought it would be. It tastes almost exactly like spearmint. It isn't very strong either. I guess I like super strong teas (being a black coffee drinker). Either way, it is a great tea. Definitely recommend it."
3,Mint?,"This is the first STASH tea I will not purchase again. I won't be giving it away or toss it out to get rid of, but . . where is the mint!? Very, very mild mint flavor. With Moroccan Mint clearly plastered on the box, I really expected more flavor."
1,Yuck!,"I always buy Bigelow's green tea (which aside from the need to use two teabags per cup due to weakness, is satisfactory). Still, I thought I'd give Stash's a go. I immediately knew that I would soon regret doing so when I opened the first tea packet-the smell! Like a stagnant swamp! To make matters worse, it taste like what I would imagine swamp water would taste like. Honey doesn't do much to improve upon the flavor, either. Perhaps this is what people mean when they describe a green tea as ""grassy""? At any rate, I won't be revisiting this one."
5,Ooooh. My favorite tea!,"The most delectable flavor I've ever experienced in a fruity green tea. I brew up large batches, keep in frig, and drink multiple cups each day. The green tea with matcha is very healthy. Needs no sugar. I choose to drink favorite teas and smell aromatic oils as ways to enjoy calorie-free pleasure."
4,Lemongrass and Mint,"It should probably be called Lemongrass Mint to more accurately describe the taste. It's especially good as ice tea, but drinking it hot is enjoyable too. The mint taste is not as strong as the lemongrass. I notice that some reviewers here say they barely taste the lemongrass, while others think it overwhelms the mint. It's a good idea to buy a box of this tea to try it out before ordering 6 boxes. I usually drink Bigelow Plantation Mint black tea, so I'm accustomed to a strong mint flavor. Lucky for me that I like lemongrass too, so the balance of lemongrass and mint was not a problem for me."
4,"Good, if somewhat flawed.","Lara Parker has woven an evocative, satisfying tale of Angelique's childhood. Her concern for characterization is evident, and she has apparently taken pains to stay faithful to the original series. Particularly, her depiction of the relationship between Barnabas and Julia is well-nuanced and in keeping with the sensibilities of most ""fan fiction."" However, I was a little surprised that no one (editor or author) noticed the incorrect relationships between Barnabas and the present-day Collinses. Also somewhat disappointing is that the book's final hundred pages are little more than a re-telling of the series episodes. This was a worthy first effort, though, and I hope Ms. Parker follows up with a sequel that treads a new direction."
5,"This is a great midnight, moonlight bed buddy, a must read!","Lara Parker is the perfect author for this tale of ""love in the shadows!"" It is written with the passionate approach which she gave to her role as mistress of the dark and deadly! Who could resist her? Who can resist this book?"
2,Disappointing!,As a Dark Shadows fan I looked forward to this book. I was disappointed that Lara Parker didn't remember the last time Barnabas and Angelique were together or didn't do any research before she wrote this book. At the end of the 1840 storyline Barnabas realized how much in love he was with Angelique after she helped him save Quentin Collins. He was about to declare his love to her when she was shot and killed by Lemar Trask.Barnabas chased after Trask to get revenge but was thwarted when Trask went into the parallel time room and disappeared into 1841 Parallel time. None of this is mentioned in Parker's book. She writes Barnabas' character as if he still fears and hates Angelique even though this book is supposed to continue the 1970/71 Collins family storyline. If this book is supposed to continue the storyline Barnabas should mourn Angelique's passing. He shouldn't be fearful that she might return.The only thing I enjoyed about this book were the chapters involving Angelique's past.
4,A Fun Nostalgic Journey,"Ah..the memories I have of Lara Parker and ""Dark Shadows."" I got hooked on it as a teenager. The four years Ms. Parker was on the show were teen heaven for a lovestruck young male! Her presence on the show was inestimable. While many of the other actors stumbled through their lines and looked to the camera for cues, Ms. Parker showed a professional finesse that the others just couldn't match. And those eyes..ah, those eyes! But, the book! It's not great literature, by any means. Her foray into Angelique's tormented youth and subsequent fall into witchcraft are overdrawn and histrionic. But, if you are a fan of the show and seize any opportunity to travel those Collinwood corridors again, the book is well worth the read. Lara, you should still make movies. Think of all the great ""character roles"" you could play now! But keep writing; your greatest fan is awaiting another opportunity to share in your nostalgia, too!"
4,Dark Shadows returns,"I just finished this book and really enjoyed it from beginning to end. The only sore point was that a lot of detail was given to Angeligue's time in Martinique with her father, but then as the story progressed the detail became a summary of the Dark Shadow's series and how Barnabas became a vampire. I wish that more detail could have been presented.Parker did a good job in bringing the series to life and I remembered how good it was- even the 1991 series was good. This is an entertaining book and I cannot wait for the next one to come out."
3,Harder Read than the first.,this book was good but I felt like I was backtracking from the first book. It was good to have the background knowledge but I did not like already knowing so much bad about the characters from the first book.
1,Extremely disappointed,"I am a photographer and ordered the Museum Etching paper for pictures already sold and needing to be printed. The bottom edge of the box was damaged though it was packaged very well so I know the damage was already there when it was mailed. Consequently I have wasted expensive ink and paper trying to fill the orders. The corners of the all of the heavy papers were bent just enough to distort the paper and printing. So it is a wash. I tried to handle this earlier but never heard back. Unfortunately this is the second time it has happened, so I will have to be very careful when I order in the future. Spending the money to mail it back only adds to the problem. Very clever way to pass off a problem to someone else. Buyer beware!"
5,Great Idea,"I received these headphones as a gift. I didn't think I would use them at first since I use the ear buds, but they are so much better on so many levels. I can use them when I work and not disturb anyone else. They have the added advantage of partially blocking the other sounds around me. Great on an airplane too. Do they have Bose quality sound? No, but the sound is very good, actually great for the price. I had to return the ones I received since they were for Gen II and I have a Gen I Nano. YOU MUST GET CORRECT MODEL FOR YOUR GENERATION OF NANO. Although the info didn't show the cord to plug into my computer, it was included. I also love the way the headphones fold under when not in use, and the fact that I can operate my nano by touch w/o taking the headphones off my head! Wonderful idea. I would recommend to anyone."
5,Heater,This little heater throws a good amount of heat. If I had one complaint it would be that it has some corrosion that has begun to emerge. But I don't care. HEAT is what I want... not pretty heat.
4,Good supplement but not a replacement,"This book is a good supplement to PMBOK 2004. It's like the Cliff Notes for the PMBOK. Just like Cliff Notes, you need to read the original first and use the ""notes"" for review. You woll need to work your way through PMBOK 2004 first and, then, use this book as a review.It is not a replacement for reading the PMBOK. There are no short-cuts."
5,One of the best NA flutists out there,"Ron plays superb music without the usual gimmicks associated with the Native flute. His nylon-string guitar playing is outstanding, too, and complements perfectly his catchy flute melodies. Roybal is an unassuming master musician: do not overlook his work."
4,"Not pretty,but pretty nice!","Not that looks are important in a bike that has comfort and plenty of quality features,but hmmm yellow? rides nice and smooth,i like the gear controls, they switch easy and overall bike is well made,great price!"
2,Back wheel bent badly,"Ordered on line, picked up in store, box was damaged when I was getting it from the store, was kind of hoping bike would be ok and I could start riding with my sons, but NOO...Back wheel bent so much is not ride able...still want this bike so I'm going to try one more time to ship it to my house"
3,Cool...but dangerous!,"I purchased the Kettler seasaw for my daughter for Christmas. Both of my kids love it, but it is a must to have adult supervision. 2 issues...not all that stable on the ""3 leg"" tri-pod design, unless you anchor it down, which you can. Secondly, the seats are a little on the small side with a bar to hold on to. I would recommend some type of strap to hold them in. Be careful when they go to get off the seasaw, stabilty as well as not to drop the child that is still on the other side. Other than that, we love the design, Kettler always puts out great products."
3,Stamped metalware,"This is a stamped metalware meaning it starts as a flat piece of metal (the blank) and then the blank is merely put into a press and the piece is bent into the shape. So with that said this does not have a ""crafted"" quality to it. They tried to dress it up a little with black silicone inserts but that's like so 10 years ago. If you have a high quality kitchen or are a high quality cook this isn't for you."
3,It's fine,"It's constructed fine. My cat freaked out when I put it on, though. I wouldn't buy it knowing that. Now it's just sitting there."
1,Horrible,"The patterns are beautiful. But it is a shame that they are written so poorly and so full of errors. Don't waste your time, you'll end up too frustrated. Why they release these when they are clearly not ready, I'll never know. Quite a disservice to the ""Vogue"" name."
1,Nothing to see here...,"OK, so it was a 6 or 7 bucks, and I wasn't expecting *great* things out of it, but I did expect to glean a tip or two about improving my skeet game. Instead, this was basically a way for 2 guys to get their names out there in the public eye as instructors. The entire movie was these two guys being interviewed in the background while video plays of an instructor and a kid shooting a round of skeet. No instruction, no real introduction to the sport. It's paying $ to see someone else shoot a round with no idea how they're doing, how they can improve, or how you can apply anything that you're seeing. Weak."
2,Garmin Rino,"This was a gift. It worked perfectly. I didn't have a lot of patience with it. The menus were endless. The choices were also. It seems to be a classic example of having an unsophisticated design poured into a package entirely too small to contain it. The directions were of no help, which made using it more than I wanted to endure. It wasn't made to be user friendly enough to entice the user to explore its possibilities. I would have liked it better if less memory space were used for features and more for menus that would guide the user into the features that he really wanted to use. The screen had to be high resolution...it bordered on being microscopic in size and stuffed with information that one could scarcely sort out. It would probably be OK for a teenager with a well developed pair of thumbs and a stooping posture."
2,My Garmin RINO 130 Locks Up,"I have had one for almost a year and have sent it back to Garmin twice, they replaced it once. It still has the same problem.It will lock up and sometimes power itself off. Sometimes I can use the power button to reset it. Other times I have to remove a battery to get it to reset.There have been a couple of times I have pulled it out of my pack or coat pocket to find it locked up. But, it has also locked up while in my hand. So far this has happened when I have been in the reset menu.Has anyone else had problems with this GPS ?UPDATE: 2006-10-05Garmin has a firmware upgrade that is supposed to fix the ""lock up"" problem I was having (when using the reset menu in the trip computer). It seemed to fix the problem in my friend's rino130. I upgraded to the rino530. (no problems with it...yet.)"
1,Broke in 18 months,"I bought this TV and the 43"" model when they first came out and paid about 17k. Both scanner boards went out on this model after owning it for less than 18 months, and the TV is only used about once a week. When I called Pioneer (warranty is only 1 year)they would not let me speak to a supervisor and said, sorry, the warranty period has expired. Cost me $750 to fix. Pretty sad for an $8,500 TV."
1,buyer beware,"I have had my plasma for two years. Suddenly it went out. It turns out that the divice is burned out. The company refuses to replace despite that they have an internal recall on the power board. Repiar in my region is impossible. So for the cost of this monitor, beware!!!!!!!"
5,Motivating and educational,"Read the book in 2 days. The book flows well with personal life and bodybuilding. if you are a fan of Arnold, I highly recommend"
2,Not what I thought,"This DVD didn't give me what I was looking for. The DVD seem to promote his CD rather than teach contemparary music rhythms. I felt that Luis Conte's ""Studio Percussionist"" was a much better learning DVD. Also, ""Adventures in Rhythm"" was pretty good, but keep your remote close because he moves fast."
3,"Good, but Uninspired","Cooks Illustrated takes a strictly analytical/testing approach to creating recipes. While this approach can create good recipes, it cannot create genuinely great recipes. The results of this approach lack soul, creativity, and flair.When I picked this book up, the librarian couldn't help but snicker at the arrogance of the title. No Cooks Illustrated, these are not THE best recipes."
4,very informative,"If you're looking for a book that has the recipe for everything, this is it. The only quibble I can think of is that some of the recipes (i.e. for roast chicken) are extremely basic. No interesting spices are listed; salt, pepper, and oil make up the ingredient list. (which I suppose some people would find to be a plus, not a drawback). Overall, this is a good effort, with few oversights, as far as I can note."
5,What a Great Book!,"I just love this cookbook. I have two shelves of cookbooks at home and from many of them I use only a few recipes, but from this book I haven't yet found one I don't immediately want to try. I especially appreciate the complete information provided about technique, ingredients, and kitchen tools included in the extensive information in each section of the book.I'm convinced this book will make be a better cook by increasing my understanding of the recipes and techniques. I'm looking forward to many years of great dishes and meals coming from this book."
2,Save your money,this book is ok not as good as I had hoped you can find a lot of free recipies on the internet
5,simply wonderful,"I love this cookbook I recently recieved it from good friend and have used it so much since then which is saying alot since I have a vast selction of cookbooks. I learn so much and am content to just sit and read this book, the writing is stunning and I can't even begin on the recipes. The cauliflower recipes are to die for, they take a normally bland vegetable and totally spice it up. I think that if you don't cook alot you would be content with just this cookbook in your kitchen. And if your an avid cook this book is for you as well. I give it five stars and two thumbs-up."
4,great shape-but flimsy and no cover,"nice, good-sized firepit.agree with other reviews - once bolted it requires bending to make everything fit together.which - as noted - the metal is pretty thin so bending is not difficult.contrary to what is stated in other reviews - this no longer ships with a vinyl or other fabric cover to keep the water out.and - it notes in the description that there are two tools - but mine only came with one."
5,great backyard fireplace,"Bought this to replace the same one that developed holes in bottom after 4 years. Bottom could be stronger but the the screen is large and access is easy as the front lifts up. You are able to build a nice size fire. The original one came with a waterproof cover included.. this one didnt. We put an old cookie sheet on the bottom of the old one to cover up some of the holes to get an extra year out of it. Compared to the round fire pits out there, this was a good value."
4,Find stars you never knew existed,"The AstroStar is a great ETX accessory. My favorite feature is its ""give me a tour of what's good tonight."" It is also great for figuring out what your looking at with its ""identify this"" feature. The only drawback is you have to be really careful aligning the scope initially to get it to work. The instructions weren't that clear between the scope, the tripod, and the Astrostar book. My recommendations to you, remember to align the scope to true north (i hold a compass on the lens tube), use a bubble level to level the tube, set your watch to the second on the nights you go out, and make sure the viewfinder and scope are well aligned. Do these four things and I guarantee you'll have a great night of viewing."
3,Online Catalog Needs More Detailed Specs,I purchased 5 of these bulbs only to discover that the pins were to close together to fit into the sockets. More detailed specs in the catalog would have avoided this mistaken purchase and the nuisance of a return...
5,"A lovely, wonderful tale!","Some of the previous reviews criticize how this book is bad at being an adoption story, but that is not this book's ONLY purpose. It has a lovely, feel-good thing about it, and a book--especially one for children who can really not comprehend--doesn't have to make sense to be fun and receive good reviews. This hearty tale is a tale one will enjoy reading several times over, for even though some say it serves no purpose as an adoption story, it is a lovely, slightly wacky story that makes everyone feel great. Sometimes something is below average until you look at it from a different point of view, and this book, by most of the negative reviewers, is misunderstood, and is delightful in every way."
1,Not a safe stroller,"This is a good-looking stroller. But to me, strollers should first and foremost be safe and sturdy. This stroller, however, has some design features that put its safety in question.It is narrower than most other strollers, which could be a plus for some folks who need to navigate tight spaces.But I have a strong caution: I gave this stroller a thorough trial in the store with my child, and found that every time we turned a corner, a wheel would raise off the ground. The stroller does not have a sturdy wheelbase and frankly scared me. The problem is with the design of the stroller. I would never buy this stroller for my child, and if you are planning on buying or using it, do so knowing it is poorly designed and could tip over."
5,Grab some friends and read aloud,"After having only reading just a bit into the book after I picked it up from my mailbox, a friend of mine saw it in my car. We sat and read through over half of it sitting in his driveway...A great book to take your mind off pressing matters such as boring instructors and give you and your friends a healthy mental olympics surrounded by entertainment and laughter...not to mention some quick facts that you didn't even know you wanted to know.It's books like these that keep life interesting and the slow hours passing quickly."
3,Captures the feel of live performance,"I recently saw this Western Swing and Gypsy Jazz trio live at a taping of Mountain Stage. This CD captures the feel and fun of their stage act. Elana James shines on the standards. Highly recomended as is their newer CD , What Makes Bib Holler."
2,Uncomfortable fit,The shoes are very narrow and dig uncomfortably. I haven't been able to wear them even after trying to stretch them.
1,Too harsh for my skin!,"This worked on my body but not my face. My skin was red and very irritated for a couple of days after I used this, and I couldn't cover the reaction with makeup -- it still looked bad. I won't use it again."
2,Short & Not so Sweet,"P-Love is a good turntablist, but he can't explain things very well. There's only about 15 minutes of instruction, then a jam session with a bass player in his bedroom (what was THAT all about?) which is for some reason billed as ""Playing In A Band"".The instruction part skips over lots of stuff and doesn't go into much detail at all. Turntable Technique (a book/record combo) does a much better job of breaking things down.On the plus side, this video isn't very expensive, and there are a lot of close-up shots."
2,"The word ""Advanced"" in the title is misleading.","This book is potentially useful for some beginners who are just learning to put together 3D scenes. However, the advice, techniques, and even the sample images all fall short of professional, and certainly are not very ""advanced."" The author doesn't have much new to say that hasn't been covered in other sources - I've recently read several other books on this topic that I liked better. My advice: Skip this mediocre title, and if you're looking for a truly advanced and innovative book on professional photo-realistic rendering techniques, consider ""Digital Lighting & Rendering"" by Jeremy Birn. The difference will be well worth the price!"
1,Not for baseball deaf fans!,"Being deaf and diehard baseball fan hurts me very much because that DVD is nice in images but didn't have any closed captions (cc).I'm feeling discriminated. If you are deaf or know some deaf people, don't buy or give that DVD for gift."
5,100 Years of The New York Yankees,"The delivery was fast, the price was right, and I really enjoyed the content of the DVD."
3,Peppy,"I can't imagine a heterosexual ever listening to Erasure, which may be one of it's better features. It's retro party music, plain and simple."
1,"Great tv series, terrible video/dvd release","I have to echo the comment sof the last reviewer of this movie. First off, the editting of the bits and pieces of the episodes is terrible. The film jumps from one bit to the next with no apparent order. Secondly, the producer promote this product as being made from remastered prints. That's a laugh! The film looks like it was made to resemble an old Hong Kong martial arts film. The lighting was low and dark and the overall color had a yellosish quality. As for the audio, the editors tripped on this one to! There are scenes with Kato fighting where his yells and kicking sounds are conspicuously missing from the final edit. The Green Hornet is a great TV series! Once and for all, if the distributors of classic tv shows want to please the fans, release this and other great shows in the original broadcast format. Anything less is any insult to the fans!"
4,i enjoyed watching original episodes of the Tv series,"I enjoyed watching the original episodes from the Green Hornet TV series, they brong back childhood memories of the series"
3,green hrnwt vol 1,the movie was so wonderful and it brought back alot of old memories and made me smile now thats a movie
1,EASIEST INSTALL EVER??,"Well, that is what the box said, I bought mine a year ago, and the box is where it resides. I went to many different places and no one would install it for me --"
2,Complicated,"This is not like transformers I have had in the past. These are very hard to manipulate and pieces fall off while you move things around. Children and adults both had difficulty. Also, the keys have no storage space when not in use so I imagine they will be lost shortly. Not pleased with this toy."
3,expected more,"the engine is cool, but I expected more engine partsso my son could learn more about an engine and how it works"
1,Oh Thank You!,"I was seconds away from ordering this charger for my Mother's V170. THANKS for the reviews - you have saved me time, money & frustration for letting me know - it won't work."
1,Does Not Fit Motorola v170,"I bought my wife a brand-new v170 for her birthday. She wanted an extra charger to take to work so I bought this one. Big mistake! It simply would not fit in the charger jack. So basically, it's a worthless piece of plastic. Last night when my wife was cleaning the counter, she threw it in the trash, brand-new box and all. At $7.99 it wasn't even worth the trouble to try to return it. Don't make the same mistake I did!"
1,Bad experience,"it does look cool, but every now and then the watch stops working and nothing appears on the display. i have to push the date button to bring it back and have to reset the time again and again. problem started pretty soon, about 5 weeks after i got the watch. probably just my bad luck, but it's definitely not a pleasant experience..."
2,Not that good,"just watched it a couple nights ago. aside from a couple decent performances, a few intriguing ideas and sufficient blood during the death scenes, this film was barely watchable.i'm not a huge Cronenberg fan, but like some of his movies. i rank The Brood towards the bottom of his catalog.D"
4,mild caution,The verticle lock broke on first use but was quickly replaced for free. The spotter scope is in a really stupid six point screw mount that is hard to adjust. There is no eyepiece holder cover to prevent crap from getting into the main optics(I put a small plastic bag over the opening). That aside it's a nifty and easy to use scope.
1,useless,All my batteries are ok this tester shows me. Brand new batteries or used batteries they all look the same. Waste of money on this product!
5,not that bad,I was a little nervous buying this at first but overall it does the job. Yes its not high quality but I cant really complain.
5,Love it,"Very useful, especially for the price. We gave these as gifts and everyone loved them because they're so practical. Stop throwing away (or hopefully recycling) your batteries without testing them first. This is a must have for anyone with kids and tons of electronic toys."
4,Excellent Test Reviews. Good Vocab,"I have used Princeton Review and Kaplan both. I liked Kaplan better in a sense. Kaplan CD is much better organized, has more tools for vocab/quant improvements and is fun to use. Best of all the Kaplan practice test results are more useful than Princeton's. Kaplan provides excellent statistics of test results. Princeton's test results and explainations are inadquate at times and provide no statistics.Also I really liked Kaplan's Vocab builder tool and especially ""SELECT"" words feature which allows you to try instant flashcards of the words missed in vocab builder. One point in favour of Princeton is that their practice tests (especially comprehensions and Analytical) are little tougher than Kaplan's.Thanks"
2,Book is great; CD-ROM horribly designed,"The actual book is excellent; well laid-out, thorough, easy to read. But if I had known what the CD-ROM was like, I would have bought the book-only version.The program looks like it was coded by a marketing drone who decided to take a few Visual Basic courses, drop some acid, and start programming. For some reason, it installs not one, but two versions of QuickTime (2.12 and 3.02). The interface, which is supposed to resemble a car's dashboard, looks straight out of a Dali painting. The reason QuickTime is needed is for two annoying ""guides"" that pop up and talk to you, which is totally unnecessary... why not just let us READ what you want us to know? I find it hard to understand why a program for college seniors and graduates has an 8th-grade mentality.I am debating exchanging this book for the Non-CDROM version, but since I broke the shrink-wrap license I doubt it is returnable. Oh well."
3,Second Rate Evola,"For the new reader of Evola, try ""Revolt Against the Modern World"" instead of ""Men Among the Ruins."" ""Ruins"" concerns Evola's own application of his philosophical perspective to post-war ""current events"" rates a weak second to his first-rate theoretical works.Evolan ""initiates"" will find this work worthwhile, however, in deepening appreciation for the world-view of the Baron.Well edited and nicely bound, as most works edited by Joscelyn Godwin and published by Inner Traditions."
5,sleep safe,this alarm works just the way I wanted it to. I set it for our county and it only wakes me up if a major storm is in our area. I can sleep well knowing that it will wake me up if needed.
2,"Nice to have, if the radio kept it's power.","I bought this radio about 2 years ago. I had a problem with the a/c plug inside the radio that broke. I'm use to dealing with electronic stuff and I was carefull with the radio. Inside the radio the a/c adaptor broke and would not work. I sent it back to Midland and was sent a replacement radio. Well---walla it happend again. I contacted Midland and they said that there was nothing they could do (what customer service). Since then, It sits in my bedroom and it does not work. Thank goodness my husband works for a fire department that broadcast weather messages on his pager. If It wasn't for the weather messages from the fire department, I don't know how I would trust this radio to keep my family safe?"
2,Failed after 3.5 years,"I was quite pleased with both WR100s I purchased from Amazon in July 2008. Unfortunately, after about 3.5 years I noticed I was no longer hearing alerts for tests. Hitting the button to hear the local weather report resulted in a continuous, high-pitched tone. I checked the SAME code and frequency selector and confirmed they were still correct. The only way to get the radio to receive the weather broadcast is to unplug it for quite a while (without batteries). After it resets it seems fine for a short period, then reverts to the tone.Two stars for working as advertised, but failing prematurely. With no moving parts and having been used in a place that does not get extremely hot or cold, there's no excuse for failing,"
4,positive feedback for Midland WR-100B SAME radio,"The radio does what it is designed to do, no issues or problems with the operation of the unit.Well pleased with the alert radio. Recommned it to anyone!"
5,Midland Radio great investment,"Great purchase for the radio. If you do not want to hear it, you can mute and still have the light that comes on to warn you of weather. It will also send you child abductions info. As long as the warning is in affect, the message will play. I guess that is why I mute it. For light sleepers, the light will serve the purpose as long as it is where you are at."
1,Stopped working first month!,Glad we had a back up system. This system stopped working the first month. Tried everything to get it to work again. I know it is programmed correctly because our hand held one works fine. Tried contacting Midland with no response. Already tossed the box so can't return it.
4,Weather Alert Radio,I was very impressed. The radio took no time to setup and worked as promised. You do need internet access to setup the channels used in your area or a list ahead of time.
3,"LOVE IT, NOT!","This thing is so loud, It can hurt your ears. But it can save your life. RadioShack weather radios are better dan this."
3,Good reception but annoying alert tone.,"The unit receives signals well, maybe too well. During a storm event, the unit becomes annoying because of the frequent and loud alerts broadcast by the weather service. If there was just a tad bit more logic to the thing it would null the loud tone after the first time it gets your attention. The repeated loud tones which cannot be disabled without turning the radio off are just more than necessary. I'd recommend putting it under a pillow once you receive the first alert during a weather emergency. Otherwise you may wind up being tone deaf. There are many types of weather alert radios out there. I own two different brands myself. The other one doesn't even respond during an event as it's reception is so poor. At least this one will jilt you into action with it's very audible screech. Just get the ear plugs ready."
5,"Quality Product,",This all hazards alert monitor is truly a wonderful value. It has worked flawlessly and notified me on two occasions of potential weather hazards. It is a great buy for the price and a potential life saver!
5,A Real Life Saver!!,"This radio is simple to set up and program. Nothing fancy, just plain peace of mind. Received it quickly and the price is definitely worth every cent!!"
2,Expensive door stop,"Received the radio on February 12. Programmed it (per instructions) for our county's SAME code. We've had numerous weather advisories and a few watches and warnings since. The radio has failed to respond to a single one of them. No alarm, no light--NOTHING. Emails to the company have been answered, but with rather useless information. Emails to the local NWS officer have produced attempts on his part to verify whether or not the SAME code alerts were, in fact, sent out properly.If it eventually works, I'll be glad. But at this point, it's about as useful as a door stop. Which is OK, since we don't have any fruitcakes to use for that purpose.UPDATE: It never worked, except for responding to one test alert (the monthly test). I eventually got rid of it. Useless. Don't buy it unless you just want to run some batteries dry."
1,"Save your Money, don't buy this","I bought this as a gift for my mother. It will not work. I have owned a weather band for 15+ years without any problems, but this thing won't even pick up local NOAA broadcast. I've been thru every broadcast channel and nothing. I know it's not my area, my old one works. So I ended up taking my old one to my mothers and bringing this new one back home. Had I not already thrown the packaging away, I would return it. I guess now I will just throw it in the trash."
2,Shows Check Reception. No alarm in when warnings issued!,"I set up the WR100 on one side of my house and it said check reception and did not alarm when we had tornado alarms sounding in the area. I moved it 20' to another window in the house and the check reception has not shown up but I'll have to wait to see if it works. I had another WR100 that just stopped working after just over a year. Of course the warranty was expired, it wouldn't even pick up weather radio/dead!"
5,Great Weather Radio,"Excellent price, very easy to program, attractive...works very well. What more could I ask for?Would highly recommend it."
1,Worthless,"I live smack in the middle of tornado alley. For the past week we have gone under severe thunderstorm watches and warnings as well as tornado watches. I belong to a weather blog as well as being a stormchaser. I bought a Midland hoping to be able to warn my daughter of danger when I was at work. Since buying it four months ago ( I know it is programmed correctly) it has correctly gone off once out of about 12 alert times.According to my weather friends theirs sit silent as well. There are 15 of us on my weather blog who have Midlands and no ones has gone off, including today for the tornado watch over Kansas City. We can't all be programming incorrectly. Luckily, we have other venues for weather tracking so I try to have someone call my daughter to alert her as we can not trust the Midlands at all. Biggest waste of money ever!"
5,A MUST FOR SPRINGSTEEN FANS!,Songs written by Springsteen and performed by various top ten artists! If you love Springsteen you'll love this tape!
2,This is shocking!,"This CD is narrated by a woman who has obviosly never heard of matchbox twenty.....she calls Kyle Cook, Carl Cook all the way through it and comments that he sings lead vocals on a song from the second album, which he actually sings on the first album. The narrator sounds like a very boring teacher and almost sent me to sleep talking about my favourite band! Ive only rated this CD 2 out of 5 for the extremely short clips from Rob and Paul.....Save your money and go see them live, this sucks!"
4,It is works but could be better,"I purchased this after my 1st purchase was actually not working. The main problem was that the length of the pins were too short for my SeaMaster watch. This one has longer pin and better build quality (a few dollars more). I was able to use it and removed 2 links from my watch. But I wish that it has a longer pin so I do not have to use pliers to pull it out. The final pull actually bent the pin in the bracelet a little, made it hard to put it back."
2,Doesn't work with all bands,"I bought this based on Amazon's recommendation that it is frequently purchased with the watch I was buying. There are several types of bands as illustrated at [...] and it is very difficult to determine which type your new watch has until it is in your hands. This does not work with the Casio Men's WV300DA-7AC Waveceptor Solar Atomic Silver-Tone Watch that I purchased, so I just took my watch to a nearby jeweler and they sized it perfectly for $10. The pins in the watchband are very small and pop out several feet into the air, so be careful if you attempt to size your watch band and do it in a large uncluttered work area, like on a large dining table, and be sure you have the right tool for your band. I added this to my tool box, but I am skeptical that I will ever use it. I am happy there are still local jewelers to assist with watches you did not purchase from them."
3,Watch Band Pin Remover,"Mostly plastic with minimal metal parts. Works after setting up for a specific watch band. Does push out band pins. I do not expect it to last for a long time, but neither do I change bands every day. For $15 should one expect a precision machined device? Not even if it is made in China.Noticed the one I got is different than the picture. Mine is black and says Smart Tool on it."
1,Don't Bother,"I found this device to be very irritating and extremely difficult to use.'One of the changing pins broke on my first use although the manufacturer does include extra pins.I took my watch to a local TAG Dealer and had them size the watch band for me, as I used to do.There is no ""do it yourself"" on this one for me - skip this and just thank you Tag Dealer much for the service!"
2,Poorly built,"The forst time I used this product, the housing surrounding the screw broke. I was impressed with the design until I realized after the screw housing broke that the pin that has a flat side actually spun inside the housing, causing it to break. I think this would have been better engineered in some sort of metal, rather than cheap plastic. I am now looking for a replacement...."
1,I broke it in 2 minutes,I am obviously not cut out to be a watch repair man... I broke this product in less than 2 minutes of use. I then took the watch to a local jeweler and they removed links from my watch for free...
4,Functional Tool,"This tool does just what it is intended for - it removes pins from watch bands.The plastic base is set up with a space where the band fits in between the driving pin and the push block which is notched to allow the band pin to be pushed out of the link.The tool is very simple to use with the only requirement being that everything be lined up. These pins are small diameter and if not correctly aligned they will bend and they will break. Use reading glasses if necessary to avoid operator error.If you need to size watch band(s)and are even semi mechanically inclined, then get one and save the trip to the jeweler."
2,Overpriced and a bit quirky,"Found this wristband pin extractor/installer to function with a few quirks It seems to jam when used to pull pins and the installation of pins is a bit tricky, but functions. The spring loaded height adjustment was useless and only made the job more intricate and complicated. Construction is adequite and it comes with extra pin die extraction bits. Too bad it doesn't include other sizes or a hold-down machanism for the wristband during use. Over priced."
5,"ONCE AGAIN, WE'VE BEEN TAKEN!","THIS IS SOOOOO WRONG TO DO TO CUSTOMERS. THEY RELEASED SEASON 1 THEN CAME SEASON 2, WHICH I PURCHASED - AND THEY WEREN'T AT A BARGAIN EITHER.NOW, HERE THEY COME WITH THE WHOLE SERIES BOX SET. THAT IS FOUL PLAY. WHY DIDN'T THEY JUST RELEASE THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE, AND THEN OFFER INDIVIDUAL SEASONS LATER.IT'S NOT FAIR TO ALL THE PEOPLE OUT HERE WHO ALREADY PUT OUR HARD EARNED MONEY DOWN FOR THE FIRST 2 SEASONS TO BUY THEM ALL OVER AGAIN, IN ORDER TO HAVE THE WHOLE SERIES!AS MUCH AS I WANT THIS THING; THIS TIME, I AM TAKING A STAND. I REFUSE TO BUY IT. I'LL WATCH MY 2 SEASONS AND CALL IT A DAY."
5,my favorite show of all time.,"when my husband first introduced dr. katz to me, i was in the shower so i only heard the audio. i was cracking up SO hard i had to shout, ""baby what is this?!"" i had seen it on t.v. when i was a kid (i am only 24) but the squigglevision turned me off since i was so young. i never tried it out. well, when my huzzy showed me what he had burned on his itunes, dr. katz soon won my heart completely and i bought the complete series. 2 years later, my husband and i watch it all the time. it's perfect after a night of wine consumption to leave on just for audio and wake up to the music. dr. katz and ben have the rapport that i will have with my own kids. love you, dr. katz!"
5,Couldn't be happier!!,"My daughter is now 15 months old and the money spent on this furniture was well worth it. We have all 3 pieces, it is sturdy, doesn't shake apart like some other types of cribs. With this type of furniture she will grow into it, not out of it. We just love it!!!!"
2,worked great until the plug broke,"I loved this charger until the flip-out plug broke inside the charger and it went dead. I can't swear the break wasn't my fault--I'm a scuba diver and my chargers go with me all over the world, and see, um, active service--but I haven't had a similar mechanical breakdown from any other charger I've ever used. Until that point it seemed to deliver all it promised. I haven't tried to get the maker to replace it. But this is why I always bring at least two chargers with me. The batteries continue to work well."
5,Buy a MiniDisc player now!,The Sony MZ-E25 Portable MiniDisc Player was the first and the best player available for its price. Music is just the start of minidiscs. Don't bother buying a DVD player. Movies and computer games and programs are the next applications to be utilized on minidiscs. These minidiscs are going to be the future of digital information. Their excellent skip protection and inability to be scratched is just a few of the reasons to purchase one. Buy one now to get a head start on the craze.
3,"Love it during the day, but it doesn't work at night.",Depending on the difference between the outside and inside temperature of your home it will be off anywhere from a few to several degrees if you mount it outside of your home window as they suggest. I mounted mine to my deck in the shade and the temperature is very accurate. Despite their claims you simply cannot see the display at night. That being said it looks great during the day and I really like the min/max temperature feature. Overall I'm happy with it.
2,digital window thermometer,It is not what i exspected as it in farienht and not centigrade. I would have also liked to know the price in pounds not dollars as it turned out very pricey.
3,Okay for a while,"I've had two succumb to moisture, which eventually gets into the circuitry and gives wildly wrong readings, I guess by changing the sensor resistance. Drying it out only works until it gets wet again. Probably some seal fails.Various accuracy, but a single one gives consistent readings so you can mentally add a correction if needed.Set the clock to standard time even when it's daylight time.Put it in the shade (hard to arrange since the sun travels much more than a half circle in the summer).The glue comes off the window cleanly but it's not then reusable on another window."
2,Inside temperature has strong influence on reading for outside,"I like everything about the thermometer except its most important feature: the outside temperature is too strongly influenced by the inside temperature.Ok, so I have it installed at my place in the mountains where the difference at night on the inside/outside termperatures can be forty degrees or more. Many mornings I check this thermometer with two other outside thermometers and find the other two may read, for example, 15 degrees and this one will read 35 degrees. It will be 60 degrees inside.My window is double-paned, but that still does not insulate sufficiently to produce unreliable outside readings.When not window-mounted and placed by other thermometers, the readings are acceptable and consistent."
3,Say what?,"I was completely fooled by the size of this device. I felt the picture portrayed it to be one of those big ones. However, it's smaller than the size of a CD case.The MAX resets automatically every morning (6am ish) and MIN resets every night (8pm ish). I think this is cool and bad at the same time. Depends what kind of use you want for it. I wish that could be a setting rather than static.The thermometer has no back light. At night, if you want to see the temp you will need to have light behind or rearrange your viewing angle to see it correctly.I bought this on a whim in the Amazon Gold Deals. Otherwise, I'd say dont get it."
4,Thermometer,This product works as expected although you can't read it when it is dark outside. It arrived on time and in good condition.
2,Seemed good at first...,"I loved the look of the product when it first arrived, and it worked well for the first few days. It became clear pretty quickly that the indoor temperature had a strong effect on the readings, especially since the place where we really wanted the thermometer was an old-fashioned, single pane window. I suspect it would work better on a newer double-paned window, but we were starting to figure out the differential and to make it work. However, the final kicker came this morning when we discovered that a moderate rainstorm with a few wind gusts has blown the thermometer off the window entirely. The adhesive definitely doesn't stand up to the weather. We're in the process of looking for a new and more protected location that is actually visible to us from inside the house, but I'm not happy about that, since the original location seemed just perfect."
3,Nice but has flaws,I like these LaCrosse outdoor thermometers. The numbers are big enough to read from accross the room and they have a modern look to them. They also seem to be very precise. I have two of them on our house. They do seem to have a design flaw though and I have gone through 4 of them in the last 3 years. They are suceptable to moisture penetration and tend to fail when wind driven water gets into them causing the display to go blank. This is often an irreversable condition. This condition is aggravated when the weather is cold enough to freeze. The life of the instument is only about 12 - 18 months; the instrument usually going bad before the battery life is used up.
5,GOLD UP IN MY WATCH,"LOVE this watch.... fits nice, very stylish. Love to wear it out to dt....best gold watch for under a 100."
1,"Nice price, but...","I bought this holder for my dad's LG2000. I thought it was a good price for something that he wanted; however, you really get what you pay for. I had to buy him a leather holder instead, after he received this ratcheting swivel belt holster and lost his phone while using it. It's only a small piece of plastic. The phone clips inside of it, of course. It seems that it is sturdy at first, but if you move around a lot or simply hit it from the top, then it will pop out. Luckily, someone found dad's phone and returned it to him unharmed! My advice: don't buy this product unless your phone is insured."
1,Synthpop/EBM,"Electronic Bowel MovementFine, listen to it if that's what you want to hear/dance to, but PLEASE STOP CALLING IT GOTH!!!"
1,Repetion of Too Many Songs from the Past!,"Although I own only one Cruxshadow's CD, Fortress in Flames (which I like very much), I am perturbed by the number of times the same songs seem to reappear on subsequent discs. This discs has 5 songs that appear on Fortress in Flames! Are they running out of ideas or what? I will wait for new material thank you."
5,How do they do it?!?,"Once again, the Cruxshadows have topped their selves with their most complex and creative album to date. This is their best yet!Layer upon layer of musical intricacy...epic lyrics, breathtaking rhythms...awe inspiring on disc and performed live...You can't call yourself a Cruxshadows fan if you don't have this album!What will they come up with next?"
1,Good book but bad movie,"After reading the book by Nora Roberts, I was so excited to get to watch the movie. I couldnt put the book down, and was so surprised by the end. The movie, however, did not have the same charm. I really like Heather Locklear, but I do believe that she was too old for this role, and the acting WAS NOT GOOD. So, if you havent read the book ~ read the book, but as far as the movie, I would not recommend it."
5,Angel's Fall,"Nora Robert's Angel's Fall I loved this movie a lot. The actors were top notch in protraying their roles. I enjoyed Heather Locklear in this movie. She did an excellent job protraying her ""haunted"" character. The drama and suspense grew to the end and the end was a suprise! I loved it!"
2,Angels Fall,"This is an alright movie, but dissapointing after Montana Sky and Carolina Moon. It is worth watching once, but the book is so much better than the movie. I guess the characters in the movie just didn't hold up to what I pictured when I read the book."
5,No need to look further,"Sometimes exercise ""books"" are tough to follow becuase the pictures don't move. But Jay's book has been done it in a way that helps the reader grasp the concept. The photography and easy to understand descriptions are actually capture the movement.Jay Blahnik is one of the most forward thinking professionals in fitness. In the last ten years, he has become the fitness expert people go to for sound research and exercise application that ""make sense"". Like his workshops and lectures, this book is fun, easy to read, easy to apply and easy to adapt to every individual looking to gain, maintain or improve flexibility! This is truly a GREAT BOOK!"
5,Amazing!,"I have been looking for a good book on stretching, and there are so many out there, I had no idea which one to select. However, I have been to a couple of Jay's presentations (author), and he is an amazing teacher. So, I thought buying his book would be a safe bet amongst all the other choices.It is amazing! Easy to understand, great pictures and some interesting new information about stretching I did not know. Mostly, though, I love the routines. Every stretch book has stretches, but not every one has routines! There is a simple to follow routine for everything from tight shoulders to lower back problems. Some short routines, and some longer routines.I love this book, and have already noticed a difference in the way I feel and my flexibility."
1,Not Worth The Price,"This volume contains a number of factual and conceptual innacuracies and a soporific writing style that made it extremely frustrating to read or even to use as a reference work.The Grout/Palisca volume is still the benchmark history of the music of Western Europe, not to mention more accessible and $437 cheaper!If you are the type of person who revels in the minutiae of things, and have hundreds of extra dollars lying around to spend on this doorstop, then you should buy this book."
2,Horrible Product,"The description states the unit has an auto dimmer, but I am convinced it actually gets brighter when you turn the lights off. It lights up the entire room at night with this eerie blue light & I have a pretty large room. After 2 weeks of use the unit started shutting itself off - not the alarm - the entire unit. Pretty useless if you are counting on it to wake you up! I gave it 2 stars because the motorized CD door and remote control features are nice, but they are not worth the hassle of the other issues. Don't waste your money on this product!"
2,Don't expect too much,"This book covers some useful concepts, but fails to develop these ideas through a careful analysis of some books."
4,Good advice,"I'm glad I bought this book. There is definitely good content here and I will continue to work with it. I just wish I were more impressed with Frey's own writing. It gets the job done in a heavy handed sort of way, but isn't something I'd want to emulate or enjoy reading for hundreds of pages. This isn't a big slam, just a little case of being fussy. Hence the 4 instead of 5 star rating. It's still a valuable reference."
4,It's About Ethics and What We Do to the Land,"I'm thrilled to find this paperback. Calicott tries to answer the ethical questions which have been ignored by all converts to the New Individualism.. The author is a philosopher and an excellent academic writer. It took me a while to get used to him. Since 1994 this work has been a guide for writers who deal with the ethics of land use. In the U.S. we perceive the land as a commodity. Calicott surveys the ecological ethics of many cultures, now overwhelmed by Euroculture. He starts in the Mediterranean Basin with the historical roots of our environmental attitudes and values. Then he covers the rest of the earth including those of the original settlers of the Western Hemisphere. But he also details ""A Postmodern Evolutionary Ecological Environmental Ethic""and contrasts it with our traditional environmental actions. He admires the work of Hindu environmentalists as well as Buddists in Sri Lanka and Thailand. Where else can we learn about this?"
5,Steve McQueen rocks!,The movies are classics and provide a great history of the sport and some of its tops riders back in the day. Great buy!
3,Blast from the Past,"Having always heard about these flics but having never seen them I finally broke down and purchased this set. Unfortunately, the whole thing is so old, it really doesn't hold the impact it once did and people should really give it a rest who keep championing this film. It's a quaint documentary about a select group of mostly long dead bikers who roared around on creaky old bikes in the mud and want us to applaud their masculine efforts. I don't know, I'm a biker, but it bored me. Love Steve McQueen but he's barely in it despite being the producer. They need to make a new one of these. Best just rent it."
3,Hot Rods/Music/ Romance/ A story with a message/ Safety,"Good cheap fun . Basic story about young people, romance, old cars, surviving bad decisions to learn valuable lessons in life. A few wild kids cause trouble for the group, someone dies young, and the rest grow up wiser and safer.A few nice old cars thrown into the mix to stir up old memories. Get some popcorn , relax and enjoy ."
5,Absolutely delicious!,"I found this new CD from Vanessa in a big store in Paris, last february. It was a total surprise, and I bought it immediately to open it only at my return to my homeland, Chile. This album concentrates all that Vanessa is in music. Soft and inviting melodies, meditating and ethereal tunes and, above all, good music, that reaches the soul and the heart. You will devore this awesome album from the first 'til the last second of sound. Don't wait any longer!"
5,"SO SENSUAL, SO REFRESHING!","What can I say, Vanessa has done it again. Make You Love is the new cd from Vanessa Daou. It's serious mood music! I've been a huge Vanessa Daou fan ever since I heard ""Two To Tango."" There really are no words to describe this cd. But if I had to, Make You Love is funky in a cool way and simply MAHHHHHVELOUS!!!!!"
4,Adequate Autostart,"This system was relatively simple to install, although it did take some time, about Three hours total. I all ready had an autostart system in my 1994 chevy silverado, so I just took that system out and replaced it with the Bulldog RS92. The range isn't great (Maybe 400 ft with an external antenna), but it does what it's supposed to do. As a cheap remote start system, it works great. One little tip: the manual suggests purchasing an additional relay for the parking lights, but this can be easily fixed by simply connecting the hot wire for the parking lights to the accessory power line. Reasonable remote start system, but if power lock control or security are desired, look for a different system."
2,Too far from true,"I was disappointed with the liberties taken to alter history in this book. With so much written about the Mona Lisa, Leonardo Davinci and the Medicis, the author takes too far a leap with the character's personal lives. I am a huge historical fiction fan, and although well written, this was frustrating to read."
4,All right for some things,"These little toys aren't very well made. Their paint comes off easily and aren't very sturdy. I still enjoy them, though. They're good for things that aren't too strenuous, if you know what I mean. I think a kid should be about age 5 or above before they get this toy."
4,Tons of fun,I bought this for my 7 year old grandson for his birthday. He loves it and his 3 year old brother loves to play with them too. Totally worth the small price. It came in the exact condition they described and even though ordered late it arrived ON his birthday. Would recommend.
1,):,"These toys were in a really bad shape, two tails fell off when I opened the package and the coloring is peeling off everywhere."
1,Visual description is not what you get,"description is not what you get. Amazon displays that there are 6 different colors and you only get one color. The color we got is a color we do not like. Very disappointed in how Amazon made us believe we got what was shown. However, the company gave us a full refund but said that amazon put the picture up and it is misleading. We still have a color we don't like but at least we did not have to pay for them."
3,"Poppy, derivatve, but nice","Fingers Cut reminds me a lot of Ben Folds, Built to Spill and the Shins. The songs here are fairly gentle rock songs with acoustic elements and geeky vocals. As such, Fingers Cut dares to be sensitive without being overly sentimental. Some of Megamachine does feel a little cheesy, but it's still the perfect album to buy for someone who otherwise would be listening to something much more unpalatable."
1,Odd flavor and smell very bad for me.,"I got this at a local store...This bottle costs $1.49. I don't know what is it about the flavor, but I find the taste so repulsive. Took a sip here and there...and decided to throw the rest down the sink. Bottle is ""BOYLAN VINTAGE SODA POP - DIET BLACK CHERRY"" 476 ML) Well seems like the rest of other reviews are positive. It's my first time, so I guess I did not develop a taste for it. If it is good for you guys, good for you. I can't even describe the flavor and texture and smell because I don't know what words to use. It smell funny...I don't know how to say it...or if word it correctly...but smell like PAINT?? Smell like some paint chemical I am drinking!"
2,flimsy at best,"Some pins do not align up right with the connecting tube. When my 5 year old gets off, one of the hooks pops out of the frame even though it is all the way through like the directions say. junk...two stars is way too generous"
3,a little more light wieght than exspected,"When I was young we had a hamock. Same stile as this one, however a lot heaver and stronger fram. So far I've had no problems just feel like I need to stay still are it may give out.I like to use the hammock to look at the stars at night and just relax. I would highly recomend a hammock if like me have a lot of stressful work days and need something to help relax.Maybe, buying the cheapest is not the way to go. Well always remember nothing is free and you get what you pay for."
4,"Prompt, wobly while assembly, but sturdy when using","Over all, a very good product for the money. I got the ""super saver shipping"" and it actualy showed up 2 days early. small damage to frame, but im planning on spray-painting it teal, so i wasnt concerned about the small scratches. Seemed very wobbly while i was assembling, but once i set it up, it seems very sturdy. I sleep on a hammock, so im trying the one it came with but i dont have super high hopes, as i am used to more of a coocoon style, but for a flat hammock, very comfortable. the pillow was an absolute joke. inch and a half of foam. Im planning on using it for something else, like part of padding for a stool i bought. also, the frame was shorter, and longer than i expected. Very wasy to get into for me, but a friend ( who is only 45 and has no joint issues has trouble. All in all a good product for a young family with good strong joint who have little money to play with. Happy hammocking :)"
3,Fun Ball,"When I purchased this for my 2 year old, she was too small to get on it. Even 6 months later, she has a hard time getting on it herself. It doesn't really bounce. I actually found one just like it the next week at the local Dollar store for half the price and of course no shipping! So I was bummed."
2,Not worth the $$,"The product isn't anything like the picture. The picture leads you to believe the item is 2 colors, a shiny black for the main unit, and a gray for the door. It's not. It's only black, and there's no gloss to it - it's just a dull black.I doubt this item will last more than one season outside. Buyer beware.Update [10/15/06] - I was right. The item is JUNK. All rusty, all the bolts, and the little chimney - rusted. Looks horrible. Stained brick paver patio. GARBAGE!!"
4,Good Book,"I only got this book because I needed it for government, I don't like comic type books. It was cute though. And in good shape."
2,Disappointing... from a die-hard Tintin fan.,"First off Tintin is one of my all-time favorite book series. I used to read them as a kid and still have all them that were purchased nearly 30 years ago, and I'm looking forward to reading them to my son when he gets a little older. I accidentally discovered that this book was available, and bought it straight away.I'm disappointed because that everything that makes Tintin a great read is not here. No story, no characters, no adventure. Just a series of should-be fatal accidents and hardly any dialogue. Frankly I don't care so much that the drawings are not as refined as the rest of the books. What does bother me is that the content of this book is so dumbed-down. I was a tedious read - so much so that I could barely finish it.I gave it two stars instead of just one because it does have obvious collector value. If you're looking for an enjoyable read, in comparison to the other books, I would steer clear of this one. I wish I had."
1,The worse TinTin title ever!,"I am always hungry to read more and more of Tin Tin stories. I am even so addicted that I read the story frequently. I started reading Tin Tin when I was 12 years old and I never stopped even if I am 33 years old now!Luckily Tin Tin in Soviet land was not the first of Tin Tin adventures that I read, otherwise I stopped! The worse of all adventures with so much of unneeded attack on communists that it reach racist level against Russians! As I finished reading it I had doubt, is it really Herge who wrote it?. Is it the same writer who wrote as I consider the best peace of art in the world of comics?So if you didn't read Tin Tin ever, I don't recommend that you start with this title! And pick any of the other Tin Tin titles."
2,The drawing is not as crisp as the subsequent TinTins,"A very funny book. I enjoyed the story very much. However, the drawing is not too sharp (as we are used to in TinTin comic books). The faces of TinTin and Snowy are very rough. Herge definitely improved his drawings in the subsequent TinTins. The story is really funny."
3,army men,"this game was really fun the first couple of days that i played it.then i played it on two player coopertive mode,and it was also really fun.then after a few days it got kind of boring.i stop playing it,the game was the same every level.blow this up, get this,protect that.so if you want a game to play for the weekend while a friend spends the night rent this,but i dont recommend buying it.but if you like army men games you should buy it, im sure you'll love it."
2,terrible,"the one I purchased was used. For future buyers, purchase new and un-opened CD players that can be found online or in electronic stores"
2,Good only for the Northeast,"I am also a biologist, and was not particularly thrilled with the book. The drawings are decent, but the amateur key used to limit your choices is too amateur. The distribution of covered species is strictly for the Northeastern U.S., except for the occasional wide-spread grasses. If your not in the Northeast, another guide would be more benefical."
2,"Useable, but flawed","As another review noted the range of this book is limited, from Minnesota to Kentucky and Maryland south, and north to Maine, although some of the grasses are more widespread. The copyright date is 1979 and while that does not disqualify it, it has not been updated. It suffers from 1) poor reproduction of the line drawings which are supposedly ""as beautiful as they are exact"" - they aren't either in this edition, being too small and with line details running together to show nothing but a black blob in many cases, and 2) no photographs, which I have come to expect of any decent field guide nowadays (especially in the absence of GOOD line drawings!). Also, the grasses are organized ""by visual similarity, not always by taxonomic grouping."" I'd prefer the latter.On the plus side it has a useable key and often interesting information is presented for a species. I'll keep this book, but I would have bought something else had I known!"
5,Grasses: An Identification Guide,I love being able to identify all the difference grasses. This one covers more than I need but is wonderful to have for reference when traveling
1,not very useful,"We have a box of these here, inherited from a college. They are unread, as they are largely useless. The book is outdated, not thorough; its title is misleading, and the illustrations are not very good."
2,RTurba - Rio de Janeiro - Brazil,This is a book for history and art students. The text is very hard. If you are looking for a book with a lot of pictures....believe me buy other...
2,Easily tips over,Looks good and is comfortable but it is very easy to tip over when getting in or out. For this reason I would not recommend this product.
1,Ropes are fraying and snapping after one month of use!,"This product looked great, and had wonderful reviews. We were excited to receive it and set it up. It's very comfortable. However, we've used it for about one month, and yesterday my daughter noticed that a rope had snapped. At first I thought it had come undone, but then I looked more closely and realized that not only had it snapped, almost all of the ropes were chafing on the spreader bar and many had worn more than halfway through already. With only small children on it, another rope has had one of its three strands snap. So basically this is unusable after only one month. We never had anyone heavier than 150 pounds use it, and together with children, no more than 220 pounds total on it at one time. So much for 400 pounds!EDITED: Although Amazon never got back to me about returning this, the company Texsport was very willing to work with me and is sending me a new hammock. 5 stars for Texsport customer service!"
5,Excellent value for money,This hammock is excellent value for money. It is wide enough for two persons and the quilted quality makes it very comfortable. How long it lasts if left in the open to the elements can only be tested over a long time. I would not recommend leaving it out in the open to get wet and then dried by the sun repeatedly as the Ultra Violet effects may shorten the useful life of the fabric.
3,"If it rains alot, this might not be the one for you","We received this hammock as a gift but returned it because the hammock is made of padded material, almost like a bedding. This is comfortable I'm sure, but we live in a very rainy area where that type of material would deteriorate quickly. So we are opting for the traditionally cord style. Not a bad hammock, but might not work in all climates."
2,I Can't Take It!,"I got these CDs based on some reviews, but I can not take the singing. There are far too many little kids singing, and the adults are no better. It is WAY too gimmicky. If you want just traditional songs sung nicely, this is not the set for you! I am going to copy the songs I like and make my own CD - I think there are maybe 2 songs per CD I'll use! BAD!"
5,not your typical kids songs,"I have bought other children's songs CD's recently and this is my favorite. The songs are made for your children (my 6 month old loves them), but they don't drive me crazy like others I have heard. The kids that sing on the songs are even good and cute without being obnoxious. And I love that there are so many songs. Good value for your money."
1,My CD players can't play it,"I have cheap, ""kids-proof"" music system, and it would not play these CDs! This is the first disc my kids can't play.Most likely, copy protection, that my simple system does not support.No problem playing it on PC - but that was not an intention."
3,Big improvement from my old grater,I like this grater a lot more than my old box grater. It has a sturdy feel and I like the small holes on the back for grating cheese. I'd give this grater 5 stars if the handles didn't fill with water during washing. I drilled holes to drain the water out. The plastic tub is kind of useless too.
1,Gone Rusty!,"I bought this grater as I wanted a stainless steel one which wouldn't corrode and it came in red. However I have noticed after only a couple of months use that underneath the rubber anti slip bottom, my grater has gone rusty.How can this be? I thought. It's stainless.Then I re-read the description, 18/8 Stainless - gotta say I've never heard of it - just good old true to form 18/10 - so obviously this makes a huge difference.I am SUPER DISAPPOINTED with KitchenAid as I thought their products were the creme de la creme when it comes to kitchen ware.I will think again before buying anymore of their products - or check that it is REAL stainless steel - not the fake stuff!!!"
4,Easy to use...Cleaning in Dishwasher is easiest method,"Mine came with a container on the bottom to catch the grated food. It sounded and looked like a great idea, until it quickly cracked and broke. I can and do still use the grater though. I mostly use my KitchedAid food processor though to do a lot of my grating. I pull this out when I already have my processor in use and/or dirty."
3,Some design flaws,"As I do a lot of home cooking from scratch, I was attracted to this product because of the bottom container with measurements thereon. Unfortunately the container is a dark charcoal, making seeing anything inside almost impossible. And, although most of what you are grating falls into the container bottom, quite a bit still falls in front of the grater (even if tilted backward at an angle), creating somewhat of a mess. Guess I'm back to using my flat metal grater which either hooks over the edge of a bowl or sits inside the bowl. Try again Kitchen Aid."
4,"Very good read, but not an easy read.","As some other reviews have stated there are a plethora of characters to try and keep up with. I do not fault this as most are historical personages and they are included to give some idea of the chaotic doings of the time. Making deals, immediately breaking deals and general comings & goings across Northern Europe & England. I enjoyed the read but as one reviewer as noted you have to back up & reread from time to time. This is one of the only books I have found with the whole complement of personages. Gives a good impression of general chaos prevailing in that time and gets better the further into it you get. A good coverage of the battle and the lead up to it and the author attains that special something that we all look for in a good book. In my opinion money well spent."
4,Great every day set,"We received this set as a gift, and we love it. The pieces are balanced nicely, not to heavy or too light, which can be annoying. We don't have a dishwasher, so I cannot comment about how they wash that way. We've found that air drying is not the way to go, so we do wipe them. I would highly recommend the set for every day use."
3,Entertaining,"This was mostly an entertaining read, though my only complaint was that a few of the stories got a little dry at times. The length of a couple of queens had me give up on a few, moving to the next one. However, the majority were highly entertaining, and really interesting to learn about the scandalous nature."
2,Only the first of two volumes,"This is an image scan of the original. Appears complete (unlike other versions of the same volume), but it is lacking a matching second volume."
1,havent been able to play it,"on this particular game, the game was given to me in windows 95. HE DID offer very easy instructions on how to manuver around this problem(i run xp), but when i asked for help once those didnt work, i have not received word back yet. other than that, the game came very quickly, and safely packaged."
4,Every American should read this!,"Easy to read, good reference and very enligtening. Ms. Gittleman gets the point across that fat is not making American's fat---sugar is! The fat-free, fat-reduced food industry has us fooled! I've been reducing sugar and have already lost weight and I have more energy at night after working all day then I have ever have!I hope I can convince my friends and family that need to get healthier to read this simplistic, yet very informative book!"
5,Get the Sugar Out,I bought this on Amazon and found it to be informative. I'd recommend it for anyone who is a sugar addict like myself. The sugar substitutions are numerous and one can experiment with those that meet his or her needs. I particularly liked the advice about using baby food banana to sweeten up a recipe. Worked like a charm in my pumpkin recipe. I never knew there were so many different types of sugar substitutes that are natural!
1,Too fragile,"I used to play sax so wanted to get the grand kids started on the concept. Of course, for this price this sax teaches nothing in terms of fingering on a real sax. It is just a series of keys each of which must be held down while they blow into the mouthpiece. That is OK for a small child. My complaint is that if this is made for a small child, why is it so fragile? The ""springs"" that make the keys work are not even springs at all. They are the thinnest of plastic in the mold and are extremely delicate. As soon as one of these thin plastic ""springs"" break, the instrument is now worthless to try to play notes. Just as the kids were learning to play the most basic song, the spring breaks, making the whole thing junk. No, I would not again buy a child's toy that was designed to break within the first week. The only education is for me to know better next time. Optionally, I have found that some of the inexpensive keyboards are surprisingly well made and provide a great introduction to music."
1,Poor design pitched as intro to brass,"This is just a really bad, overpriced toy. To look at it, you'd think it was slightly educational. The colored keys mean nothing. You can't even blow through this toy without pressing keys. It's sound has nothing to do with its shape and it pretty much sounds just like their trumpet offering. It's overpriced and makes a crappy gift. This is something they should sell at Cracker Barrel for five bucks."
4,"Great concept, not so great quality","My 2.5 year old loved it for a few days, but that's how kids are. It was pretty easy for him to learn how to play it. The plastic parts get misplaced sometimes, but not a big deal. Overall, it's a good toy but would like to have a better quality for the price. I haven't seen any competition to this one though, so if you want a saxophone this is all you might be able to get."
2,Too loud and too weak,"I had my r505 for just about four months now and am very disapointed, its so called 'shell' is very nice looking but is only a cheap plastic, and is sratched very easy. Also the LCD conectors are very lose and the corners break right away. Finally don't leave this monster on while trying to speak or sleep, its fan is too loud. I took my r505 to work and placed it in a line with all the other notebooks at work, blind folded my boss and told him to pick out mine. No problem he walked down the line twice and then put his hand right on it. Tink twice about buying sony's r505 series, stick to the GR, SR, or even a picturebook instead.Compaq Presario 725US Notebook (Athlon-4 1600+, is better and cheaper! Much faster than Sony!"
4,Sony VAIO 505 experience,I purchased my Sony 505 a few months ago. It is small enough to fit into a pocket of my brief case and light enough when undocked.My only problem so far is the small shift key on the right side of the keyboard. I am trying to get past the problem but still mess up often. I hope your experience is better then mine. Try a friends 505 out for a weekend or go to your local store and test drive the key board first.
3,Fun Book,"I got this as a gift. It's a fun book but defiantly qualifies as a novelty item. A one time read, and then pass it along."
1,ZERO stars isn't low enough!,"The editor and publisher should be fired/shamed to have created shuch a horrid work! What was ment to be a lazy summer read turned into something that enraged me. I agree with the other poster that it was nearly impossible to determine who said what (I gave up a few times and still do not know exactly wahat was happening). But what I do know is that there were also plot errors - things getting done twice by the same characters, or simply not making sense. Period! Perhaps they published a draft rather than the final work?? I'd say this is the only excuse for such drivel. Never reading another Fern M. book. EVER! I'll stick to my Nora R. and be gauranteed enjoyment."
2,Needed an Editors Touch,"This was a slow read from the beginning. The plot was dull not what I'm used to from this author. It picked up towards the end and at the same time dragged on. I was surprised to find how many inconsistencies this book had. For example, the wrong character names were being used. It looks like an editor never went over this book looking for errors."
1,Boring,"I have to agree 100% with the previous review. The dialogue between the characters was horrible, boring and unimaginative. There was almost no emotion and not enough substance to guide the reader in understanding how they feel in love. Needless to say, I do not recommend this book. Its a waste of money and time."
4,cool,"Nietzsche once said, ""The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher regard those who think alike than those who think differently."" Doris Henson is one of those bands would are going to stand out because they come from such a different place. They are rock band from Kansas. The ""KC sound"" is starting carry weight these days. Whereas some new wave bands seem ironic, this is the land without irony. Doris Henson recalls bands like The Church and School of Fish. ""Let You Down"" is straight ahead rock. It comes from a collection of pretty good tunes. Doris Henson combines emotion with folk and rock and creates something that you can listen to all the way through and be surprised at what comes around the corner. They are good."
3,Disappointed,"Should start by saying I'm a Scott Holt fan and have favorably reviewed some earlier CDs. On this one though, I have to disagree with the other reviews. Basically, I don't feel there is a really memorable track on this CD, period. From time to time you do get a taste of Scott's ability, but I think the material is just plain medicore. A couple of tunes have a rock-a-billy feel to which I have to confess I'm not real partial. There is also a country track and I'm fine with country, but this one is second rate at best. In my eyes it's hands down the weakest of Scott's CDs."
5,"subtle, simple and beautiful","If Mark Salzman published a shopping list I would read it. His writing is magical. The Soloist is deceptive in its simplicity. It would be easy to underestimate this book because Salzman's straightforward, unpretentious writing belies the complexity of the ideas he is communicating. There are three or four different themes expressed in alternating chapters: A cellist crippled by his need for perfection, a trial, zen theory and practice, the relationship between teacher and student. There are several more subthemes going on as well. Salzman weaves them together so skillfully that you barely realize that each theme slowly permeates the others with exquisite subtlety. The Soloist is a book worth reading slowly and with full attention It is a deeply satisfying read, in the same way that a subtly seasoned meal, savored at leisure, leaves one feeling fully nourished. Thanks once again, Mr. Salzman! Well done!"
5,Great CD!!,"This CD has it all a little AIC, Just plain good rock -n- roll. If you liked Alice and Chains you will love this CD. One of the best Cd's I have heard in a while."
5,Hell yeah,"Last summer I saw Jerry on tour with MIRV and Swarm, and he played two new songs before playing a few from Boggey Depot then playing a full Alice set. I don't remember exactly which two songs they were, ...I couldn't wait for the album to come out. Well, now that it has, it has proved to be well worth the long wait. The immediate stand out songs were Psychotic Break, Angel Eyes, Spiderbite, and the single, Anger Rising. With former Faith No More (another one of the best bands ever) and current Ozzy drummer Mike Bordin and Ozzy bassist Robert Trujillo, the rythym section is phenominal. To top everythign off, the album is dedicated to Layne Staley, which I found to be very touching. If you've ever been a fan of AIC or Jerry Cantrell, go get this album, you'll be more than satisfied at this great album."
3,Eh..,"This album just disappointed me. I bought it ...Anger Rising is a good song. I just don't like this album much.. it's way too slow.. Mike Bordin barely has to do anything. I like the guitar parts in Glass Dick Jones ... Give it a name is ok, and then there's Anger Rising, Angel Eyes, and Solitude, which are good songs. Other than that i have a hard time getting into this album.. with slow music and Cantrell's deep slow voice, it didnt hold my attention very much."
3,"i dunno if im being too picky or what, but....","i dunno... this album is just really weak to me. it may be because i didnt buy parts one and two the way jerry had originally put this together. i didnt really like anger rising from the first time i heard it, not because its music was bad or it lacked a good vocal hook but because of its sophomoric lyrics. of course after hearing angel eyes, i had to buy this cd. angel eyes is easily one of the best songs jerry cantrell has written on his own (in aic or not). some of the riffs are just jerry ripping himself off, unforunately, case in point mother's spinning in her grave is too close to god smack and about 3 other songs sound like they could have been thrown out of the tripod sessions. jerry just didnt live up to what ive known of him this time around... partially because of my bias, partially because of what i bought, partially because of jerry's writing, and partially because trujillo and bordin didnt really lend any style to the music."
5,Just what I was looking for...,EXACT information on how to achieve various effects with my sewing machine. Techniques up the kazoo with suggestions on how to apply. This one book is worth more than a hundred project type books. EXCELLENT!
4,Wonderful creative resource!,"I got this book from the library and am now going to buy it. I am a beginner/intermediate sewist who likes hip, cool fashionable clothes, and this book gave me so many ideas on new techniques I can incorporate in my basic designs. With that said, I only gave it 4 stars because the project pictures show pretty traditional and outdated clothing ideas. If you can get past the old-fashioned (no offense to those who like that stuff, but I like more current and classy vintage looks--not quilting and 80's-ish dresses with lace), you will have a treasure-trove of amazing techniques like applique (seems like a million different ways!), ruching, smocking, cording, lacemaking, etc.The instructions for each technique are clearly presented in a step-by-step manner, with pictures for each step. The layout is not crowded, but spacious so it's easy to read. Each technique is covered in 2 to 4 pages with a list of supplies and what to set your machine to on the first page."
2,"Only for fans of William ""the ham"" Shatner","William Shatner hams it up in this thriller where he portrays an ex-con conman who charms lonely women and then murders them for their money. Worth viewing for those who appreciate Shatner at his hammy best; all others beware! Filmed somewhere on the west coast of Florida (Tampa?), it looks like the production spent $85 and a weekend to make it. Also of note, Shatner's wife (at the time) portrays the hotel employee/bimbo."
5,Whoadie,"The hue and cry for more general-audience pictures with wide family appeal for young and old is answered in ""Baller Blockin',"" which, given the right kind of sell, should be money in the bank-and lots of it. Seldom does a picture come along that packs such a wallop in every phase-family life, an exciting Florida hurricane sequence, undersea shots, pathos, comedy and an almost incredible nonhuman star, a dolphin, which is almost human in its portrayal of a small boy's pet. Excellent Metrocolor and colorful scenic backgrounds add much to the fascination of the picture."
3,Mixed thoughts,"This high chair is really cute, and I LOVE the bar between their legs in the front, so you don't absolutely have to use the straps (if you don't have a climber, that is). But the material is not machine washable. Who on earth decided that a baby high chair would be a good ""dry clean only"" item? Really bad choice on that side. But that being said, I've had this chair for 3 years, and washed it in my machine on the gentle cycle. While the padding under the bum is all bunched up (we put a towel at the bottom now to make it comfortable), the rest has actually held up fine to the washings. We've also only hung it to dry. Overall, cute product that is a pain to clean."
5,Love American Style,"This was a favorite of mine already when it first came on TV. Short, funny vignettes, usually with cute, sexy ideas."
4,"Fascinating man, reminiscent of Benjamin Franklin","Grendel's biography is passionate, at times argumentative. He defends Beaumarchais' reputation against what I must assume is a tendency to dismiss him as a mere librettist for the (more important) Mozart operas.Beaumarchais rises from the middle class and embodies the emerging ideals of freedom, self-determinism and meritocracy. There are fun, fascinating tidbits, stories illuminating life ""backstage"" at Versailles. There are so many ironies, and Grendel plays them all up brilliantly.After reading this, if you're still interested in the subject, check out the French movie, Beaumarchais, the Scoundrel (with English subtitles). It follows the same narrative pretty closely, to good effect."
4,Great Shirt,"I bought this Tee shirt for my husband, who is a die-hard former Marine. I love the quote and I'm sure I've even heard him mumble those words before. The price is great and the shipping was very fast, I think I got it in about 4 days. I was very please all the way around!"
2,Not worth the buy,"Ordered two...both were too small and one has holes. I'm not even going to bother calling them, it's not worth the arguement and I'd rather let you know what you're considering buying."
2,Didn't really look like the image advertised.,I am a graphic designer and have worked for many screen printers. The quality of the shirt wasn't that great and the coverage of the graphic doesn't match the t-shirt advertised.
1,Yip yap Smells like C**P,"I just got a tin from the local pet store because my pit has some pretty bad breath now and again. I first opened the tin with the ""Now with TALKING BONES!"" )meaning that they are like the chalky heart candies we get around February) and I was over whelmed with how bad it smelled. The mints smelt terrible. and they were of a brown spotty color and not like the white color you see on the box, see attached photo. Now looking in retrospect maybe this batch has gone bad. Anyway I gave one to my dog and she eats everything and anything you put in front of her and she instantly spit out the treat. I handed her another and again the same. She would not go near the third and final one. How can something worse the her breath make it smell nice?"
3,try later volumes instead,"We borrowed this dvd from the local library. My 3 1/2 year old liked it well enough but I feel the later volumes are better and much more educational. (I'm a teacher, by the way). My son loves volume 6. It's also much less annoying to me than 1-3."
4,yellow hand stop rotating?!?! Why?,Does any one know why the yellow hand stop rotating and start again when you press the start button and then stop again later? is this normal? this doesn't affect the time. the seconds hand keeps going though. I like the watch a lot by the way.
3,Use gently,"The leather case was nice looking and decent. However, the clip part of the case was of poor quality. It was damaged within one week of use by my husband. Granted that he probably had pulled on it too hard trying to get it off of his belt, it still could have been made better and stronger. Considering the price, you do get what you pay for."
3,Looks Great,"This product is priced great and looks good on the phone. since they are hard to find in the stores now, I bought 4 of them."
3,Protector para el Motorola V3 en plástico e imitacion de cuero,"Carcasa para el V3 montable con clip para el cinturón. Buen diseño aunque el clip es un poco indeble, pero cumple la función de protejer al telefono célular....producto hecho en china"
1,Phone wouldn't work when inside this case,My phone refused to work when placed inside this case. I don't know if it's a manufacturing defect--others don't seem to have this problem. Of course it made the case useless for me.
5,Walking in my own shoes,"Kevin J.Murphy has written a book that is incredible.It is not only inspirational in a way of letting people know how precious life is,but it magnifies peoples lives like myself.That is because it touches our lives on a very personal level.A very wonderful book.This man made me relive my own childhood."
4,Amazing story.,"A bit long, but so detailed. And fascinating how they searched for the right material for the mirror, poured several versions of it, transported it across the country, polished it by hand over a period of YEARS! Amazing story."
3,Deadly Shift,There is so much more that could have been done to make this movie more convincing. The Great Los Angeles Earthquake or 2012 it is not.
3,made in China,"In case you spent a little extra to get your switch plates from an American company, you will find that this plate is made in China. Package says both ""solid brass"" and ""heavy plate"", but as they do not hold a magnet, they are probably solid brass. I have bought similar, solid brass plates from a big box store for less. So who wins here? The Chinese, of course."
4,"""Try coming to Cold Mountain sometime!""","I don't know Chinese. I know a little about Chinese Buddhism. But Han-shan and Watson have made these poem's familar: it's our condition.Each poem is a neat little eight line chunk. Nothing elaborate here, just simple poetry for our simpler side. Given all the bloated religious teachers and poets I've read, this is a refreshing change. Try to imagine how long it might take you to come up with a similar brief wise poem. Then consider Watson only translated 100 of Han-Shan's roughly 300 poems. How cold was that mountain?"
2,Broke when we finally figured it out,"It's a neat idea, but this wasn't the easiest to use. The instructions are pretty vague, only using pictures and no words. We couldn't get it to do a flip until I happened to see a commercial the other day that it requires you to pump it 25 times to do a flip. The instructions don't explain that! So we tried it, and it worked...but the second attempt landed it on the pump handle, which broke off! So now it can't be pumped!Also, the top pieces would sit on top and are supposed to snap in, and then pop off when it jumps or flips, but these wouldn't snap in properly, and were constantly falling off. You're supposed to stand it on it's nose when you pump it, so sometimes the wheels will pop out as you're pumping, meaning you just lost all the pressure you pumped into it! Not a very good toy...I called Mattel, and they are sending me a voucher to replace it, but we'll definitely try a different truck this time!"
1,Product is not ready for prime time.,"I have been a loyal customer with Pinnacle Systems since version 7. Each version has had some major quality issues with the initial release. However, Pinnacle Studio Mediasuite version 10 is the worst I have seen. To date, even with the current patches they have provided. This product flat out does not work. Previous projects dont import right, system is unstable, activation keys dont work, the performance is completely unacceptable even on a newly formated and clean installed OS. There are many more issues than this, just read the pinnacle systems web board. The product is painstakingly unusable. Also, unless you return this product back with in 30days, your stuck with it. I strongly suggest considering an alternate video editing software."
4,Very roomy and comfortable carry,"Most totes are a little dowdy, but I like the way this one looks and feels. It's sturdy and it holds lots of stuff: from my computer to several books, files, and the all-important lunch."
3,"Almost perfect, but not quite","I searched the world over for a nice, inexpensive bag to bring to Japan, to be used as a carry-on for the plane, a purse, and an overnight bag, all in one trip. I had a couple of problems. First of all, the padding intended to keep a laptop out of harms way takes up quite a bit of unnecessary space, when a laptop is not being used. Secondly, as a purse, while easy to get into and out of (and water resistant, I might add!) the straps are uncomfortable after being carried for more than an hour -- especially if there is anything of significant weight in the bag. But, on the whole, I'm glad I bought the bag, and would do it again -- I'd just put some padding on the straps before I left! (fits nicely in the overhead compartments of planes, trains, busses, etc.)"
1,Are you kidding me??!,"I have seen some bad movies. But none as bad as this one. If you are above the age of 12, then you will die trying to sit through this movie. If you are below the age of 12, then engage your mind in something for thinking people.This movie makes Disney Channel movies look like Oscar material.The script appears to be written by less intellectually-endowed individuals who are upset that their lack of intellignce is keeping them from getting anywhere in life. (Note to screen play writer: lattitude and longitude lines are NOT parallel. They are PERPINDICULAR.Yes.)I am quite convinced that even with NO movie experience, I could single handedly manage all of the acting, costume design, and special effects to a better degree. COME ON, PEOPLE! What is our world coming to?And, if I were any of the actors/actresses in this movie, I'd, quite frankly, be embarrassed that this movie was on my resume.(And, as amazon.com, I wouldn't even want to carry this movie!)"
4,very pretty,arrived quickly. very pretty. thirstystone is always good quality. pleasant shopping experience. I have three sets of thirstystone coasters highly recommend.
5,"Bold, Evocative, Compact","If you ever wanted to get a sense of the creativity, hedonism and otherworldly experience that is the annual Burning Man festival, the simplest, easiest and most cost-effective way to do so is to pick up Patrick Roddie's ""Hips."" The photographer had the brilliant idea to shoot the unique mid-sections of reveler after reveler at the desert gathering, edit his favorites and assemble them into a book. The repetition of motif from page to page may recall Warhol's use of repeated, slightly altered images, but the singular nature of each subject's body and style in Roddie's book creates a mosaic effect that amounts to a microcosmic view of the event and its participants. Beautifully designed and fun to flip through, ""Hips"" brings Burning Man to your home, minus the brutal sun, sand storms, rain and mud. It's also a perfect gift for any weekend Bohemian who longs to join the art tribes in the desert and just can't get it together."
3,Lots Of Dino's,"Good package for your money. The movies are not that exciting and haven't kept the interest of my children or their friends. Supposed ""bonus features"" are non existent. Not the fault of the supplier, at all."
2,Disappointment,"We are big Wiggles fans in our house, and were very excited to finally see this new one. It was very disappointing. My son kept leaving the room, which he never does when the Wiggles are on. I think the problem is that they have lots of other people singing the songs, and sometimes the Wiggles are singing in such elaborate costumes, my son didn't even realize it was them. A lot of the songs are either sung with heavy accents, or for some reason hard to understand. Also, with the whole thing shot as live action somewhere in Australia (I assume) it didn't have the same fun and colorful feel as their sets. The best part to me was the bonus ""Asian Postcard"" which I'm sure is for adults because they are just filming their travels on tour from place to place in Asia. It was a great way to see these talented people as they really are, and get a sense of what life on the road is all about."
2,More like a cold shower,"My 2-year old really enjoys the Wiggles so I assumed this one would be a hit, too. Boy was I wrong! There are a few cute moments but the mariachi band (specifically the boy singer) were so awful and talentless I could barely stand to watch. The choreographer was pretty lame, too. Unlike most other Wiggly movies, this one had no catchy tunes. My son watched for a few minutes then was completely disinterested; he wanted to watch his ""other Wiggles"" instead. Skip this one and go with a classic, ie. Toot, Toot. We still love the Wiggles but this particular movie was a waste of time."
3,Not one of their best,"We own 11 of The Wiggles DVDs. This is my least favorite of the lot. Too much dialogue for our 2 year old. The songs are just OK, not great. Older children may like this, especially if they are into cowboys."
1,Son shows no interest at all!,I bought this for my 18 month old son along with Wiggles Bay and he is CAPTIVATED by Wiggles Bay - yet when I put in the Cold Spaghetti Western - he leaves the room to play with his toys! The video is possibly intended for older children - yet honestly - I was bored with this video too. There is too much going on with all the different cultures! Not the typical Wiggles Movie and I was so disappointed I'm sending it back for an exchange with the makers!
2,Big Fan...Bad Movie,"My two year old son and I love the Wiggles. But this is the least favorite of all our Wiggles movies. A few of the songs are enjoyable and catchy, especially the one about the ""Patito"" because the young boy who sings it has a strong and beautiful singing voice, but for the most part the entire movie was ANNOYING. And they got it all wrong - spaghetti is Italian, mariachis are Mexican, cowboys are American, so how are they supposed to be related in this story? They kind of just throw in all these different cultures and don't quite make a connection. Nevertheless, my son will sit through parts of the movie as he loves anything Wiggles. But I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Western,This is an ok Wiggles product. The story line is proably too drawn out. Our 4 year old granddaughter likes it and has seen it several times.
2,Buyer Beware,"The cd player is defective. I know the product was rated as in good condition by the seller, but I purchased it mainly for that feature. Aiwa sound is great for the size but this item will end up in a garage sale."
5,~ Nice Doll! Get her! ~,"Hey ya'll. My sister got this doll with her allowance in August-September. She loved it so much! Since I'm the younger one, she wouldn't let me play with it because she loved it (as I said before). She is an awesome doll! She has an elegant blue flarie dress (if that's a word) w/ diamonds, a green dress-up shirt with a star in the middle and it straps up in the back, REALLY pretty kickin' jeans w/sparkles and a real nice belt, million dollar pairs of shoes, and kickin' jewerely! (By the way, I don't really know why I am writing a review for my sis, probably because I like reviewing). Anyway, I would definetley buy her! Like the boy that likes Bratz, I agree with him! Buy her now before she runs out before Christmas time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!P.S. Get her now!!P.S.S (Try seeing Nintendogs also)P.S.S.S. Get her Get her!!!"
5,Do society a favor and read this book,we found this book very insightful and enlightening. It provides ideas to put into practice in order to help to encourage the creation of a self-sufficient adult with problem solving skills - something our society seems to have a lack of. Enjoyable reading as well. If you have gone as far in your consideration of this book as reading this review go ahead and buy it. worthwhile entertaining and useful.
5,Demanding,"As a PC flight simulator pilot, I initially found Sky Odessy to be too simple, too easy. I was wrong. The controls are indeed simple and easy to acquire, but the skills and manuevers needed to complete just the first adventure mission demand the upmost concentration. The gameplay is exhilarating, accompanied by an intense soundtrack that only adds to the intensity of flight. I have completed just two missions as of yet, but know that I will continue my unrelenting conquest of these airplanes and the mystical island of Arcadia."
4,A good read!,"This is a fun piece of space opera. The aliens are interestingly different from the run-of-the-mill ""humans only"" space opera.About the only downside to this books isn't really Huff's fault: I read this book the same week that I read Stirling's ""On the Oceans of Eternity"", and having 2 books have battles based on the same historical event was a bit much... I won't spoil it for you by telling you which historical battle is emulated, but it won't be hard to spot. :)"
4,"Not the most appealing, but very handy.","I have to admit, this is not the most aesthetically pleasing bag. But the myriad of pockets do make for carrying around all of your accoutrements very convenient. It is sturdy, and rests comfortably on your shoulder. The pocket that is expressly for the laptop is actually a great place for my portable CD player, as it is padded nicely to protect from the occasional bump. The cell phone pocket is way too small for my clunky old cell, but it works perfectly for a sunglasses holder! All around a great bag. Now only if it came in all black..........."
4,"Great features, could've used 1 more photo","I loved this bag - yet it's the first item I've ever returned to Amazon.The bag is well designed, great quality, amazing features (fit my phone, PDA, MP3 player, Laptop, and a few books for the coffee shop). God I loved this bag - and hated it.I only wore it out once - and couldn't stand it. What I didn't realize is that unlike most ""messenger bags"" which can be comfortably worn slung from one shoulder - this is NOT. It's designed seat along your back, much like a backpack - with the strap slung across your chest. It's just not what I was looking for - it all depends on how you feel comfortable carrying something. Slung on one shoulder only - the straps are Incredibly uncomfortable and the bag keeps trying to slip off because the straps are sort of at an angle.Oh well, it was a good shot. I see that a lot of other companies are following Amazon's lead in developing a smaller unisex carrybag, we'll see...jr"
2,Disappointments do Come,This started off so good. Unfortunately I got about a third into it and it just died. Sorry Linda. I am guessing you were just not into it this time.
3,"It's so terrible and yet I desperately want the next one, I don't even know","Wow, this writing is just absolutely terrible. Despite that, it continues to be an awful lot of fun.Was interesting how clear the Lovecraft influences were in this one - somehow I don't remember them being so noticeable in the first, but it's been a while. Also, dare I say Moorcock? Idk, I've never heard Moorcock stated amongst Hideyuki's influences, but I was seeing shades of him everywhere.A warning for those with triggers or weak stomachs: this book is coming out all over RAPE. Rape rape rape, every time you turn around that poor heroine is getting raped or threatened with rape again. It was kind of ridiculous."
5,A recipe for success&#65533;,"""Gary Jones had provided a recipe for success for those considering adding business valuations to their practices. There are many technical, `how-to' books and courses in the valuation field; Gary's approach, however, is unique, comprehensive and valuable to aspiring business valuation practitioners."""
2,Good for gaining good psychological mindset for risk; Horrible for practical real esate advice,"Kendra was a typical real estate investor that got caught up in superficial appreciation in the recent real estate bubble. She believed that areas like las vegas, pheonix, and florida were bubble proof. Needless to say she was totally wrong. I imagine she had to have made several bad investments right after writing this book. The mindset she presents in regards to risk taking is good advice but very few pieces of useful real estate investing advice is given in this book. It appears that her success in real estate was only due to ridiculous housing appreciation created by bad mortgage lending practices."
4,"The Housing Bubble Has Burst, But This Book Is Still Relevant","I am in the process of obtaining my Real Estate License so I made this purchase, it is an interesting book. The book is ""copyright 2006"" a time when Las Vegas, NV and Phoenix, AZ could do no wrong so they seem to put a lot of emphasis on these two markets. We all know these were two of the most hard hit areas when it came to foreclosures. Never the less, this book is a good investment, particularly on Amazon where I purchased it for a penny. Kendra is a woman of faith and principle and I intend to follow her formula to ""risk and grow rich."""
3,OldGuns.net,"Steve Frey's ""Imported Military Firearms 1866-1899"" is a wonderful reference on oddball guns of this period, and loaded with tips on their care and repair, and his personal recipes for improvising ammunition for obsolete calibers, even pinfires. I do not recommend or endorse his methods as safe or effective, but point them out as interesting information, such as his indication that .32-20 cases can be the basis to make 8mm Lebel pistol cartridges.....If the gun doesn't have much collector value, and you mainly want to shoot it, then go ahead and read up on polishing and reblueing and that sort of thing. There is a great section on somewhat primitive gunsmithing, refinishing and reloading with really basic equipment. It is useful for the bargain basement bow-wows that most of us cannot resist because they are cheap. With a little practice on these, you can progress to the more sophisticated methods described in the more technical books, and slightly more valuable guns."
3,very nice read,"I bought the book because I am interested in Italian Renaissance art. In this aspect it is a little bit disappointing. There should be far more interesting art objects than is covered. It was very nice to read about the history of the Vatican, to get a feeling for every day life in the Vatican. The knowledge in this book is important to better understand the position of art in relation to the ruling popes during the Renaissance.I very much liked the photo's. They show the real craftmanship of James Stanfield. The three star rating is because the description seems to promise more about the Renaissance art than is given."
4,The Vatican on your coffee table,"Having been to the Vatican in person, I know how hard it is to take (good) pictures of all the things there. The Vatican city with its myriad of art collections, museum, and antiquity-filled storerooms has something for everyone who likes art or history.This book does a great job of capturing the feeling of the city, and hits every major masterpiece in the place. Unfortunately, there are some masterpieces that could have used more explanation or exploration, in particular, ""La Pieta,"" and ""The Last Judgement."" This, for me, warranted the loss of a ""perfect"" score. Both of these works have a fascinating history, and tell volumes about the artist (Michaelangelo) himself.If you can't make it to the Vatican yourself, this book is the next best thing."
3,"Honestly! I expected more ""inside"" info or pictures.","Well, I guess part of the problem is that I expected to see more of the ""inside"" information and pictures in this book. It is more of a picture book with a few notations and some small feature type articles, but nothing really mind-blowing. I thought there would be more pictures of the ""never before seen"", but it was not meant to be.Still, it does have beautiful pictures of the Holy See. Not a total loss, it is very aesthetically pleasing."
2,Tinny microphone,"While the full duplexing allows for conversations where both parties can speak at once, the microphone on this isn't very good. It makes the speaker's voice sound tinny and grating. The speaker is very good, though."
5,Superb !!!,"Lovely product for the price.I love the design, and the simplicity of the keypad.only thing I would change, is either make the power adapter a smaller one, or in the format of a laptop, e.g. a cable attached to the wall, and the adapter on the floor."
2,"They didn't, once, find anything!","They didn't show anything interesting, either! They didn't explore scenery or folklore. They just went to a bunch of seemingly cool, faraway places and didn't find or DO anything interesting, at all. Just bad night time shooting and the host's really sarcastic but not funny humor."
1,Not even worth the time it takes for this review!,"There is absolutely nothing worth seeing here,no mystery solved. Unless you get a thrill out of constantly hearing ""Did you hear/see that?"",and ""What was that?""I did learn though that even in Papau New Guinea the natives speak English,LOL!"
1,worst show ever!!!,THIS IS THE WORST SHOW EVER!HOSTED BY SOMEONE WHO REALLY KNOWS NOTHING ON THE MATERIAL.NOT WORTH THE TIME. HOWEVER THERE ARE OTHER SHOWS OUT THERETHAT ARE PRETTY GOOD.
3,average,"great gun, considering it's spring powered. mag. cap. is not too great, i'd guess 32 rds. silencer and weaver are great for looks, as well as accessories, but silencer can greatly effect accuracy. red dot sight is kinda pointless, but it's better than ''iron'' sights. laser works ok, but is a pain to adjust sometimes. for $20.00, great gun. flash light is bright, although it does not light up exactly where you're looking at."
5,Packing a lunch,"I don't carry a laptop; I have enough problems with one desktop at home and four at work. BUT wrap some ""blue ice"" in a towel and put it and a sandwich, etc. in the laptop compartment, and I've got a semi-insulated lunch bag -- along with plenty of room for everything else. For some reason, I carry half of my possessions back and forth to work each day. At this time of year, this bag is almost perfect. I hate to say the price is a steal, but....the price is a STEAL."
1,Dead on arrival,This MP3 player was a huge dissapointment. It was dead on arrival. Did not function properly. I even had my 18 year old coworker make sure that I wasn't doing something wrong.
1,1GB Mp3 player,"I brought this peice two months ago. It never worked. This is a peice of junk to through in garbage. If you want to through your money like that, just donate your money to somebody. May be 1 in 10000 will work properly.Lot better products than this you can buy."
4,Very Nice for the Price,I got a smaller version of this player for myself last year. My daughter liked it so I bought this one for her for her birthday. She loves it. The earphones are kind of cheap but the player works great. You cannot beat the price if you just want something that will play your MP3s with no hassels. Windows XP plug and plays it without any problems. I have not tried it on any other versions of Windows. I may buy another one as a gift.
2,No tan bueno.,"La primer semana me funciono muy bien. Eso si, la navegacion es muy mala y dificil. Como a la segunda semana, la tercera vez ke trate de pasar canciones al reproductor, se murio de repente, y mi PC ya no lo detekto. Ya no pude pasar mas canciones. Los audifonos estan muy bien, el volumen sube mucho, pero el cable es muy corto y eso era un problema. Trate de contactar con mi vendedor, pero nunca encontre ninguna direccion o nada para ponerme en contacto con alguien."
3,Trio Red Mp3 Player Firmware Info!,"Works OK, but can crash and loose all data and firmware. Mach Speed's site is DEAD as far as any mention of this product and firmware update/reinstall! All links are redirected to a new site that's of no use! But wait, if you do own the red version only, and the player goes brain dead, there is HOPE!I found this link that worked for me and I got everything I needed to reinstall the latest/last firmware there will ever be!Try this link if it stayes in this post.[...]Everything is there for now, 3-22-11. You will loose your songs!If the link does not get posted try the the forward slash slash thing and then [...]The firmupdate2.html in the important part. All other posted links only go to firmupdate and to a dead end.Good luck"
3,"Good enough, despite some issues","I've got this player for my B-day two and a half years ago. It's still alive, after a couple months in coma.For the first year I was quite happy except the fact it refused to read names of files in the form I saved them. It is inconvenient if you listen to foreign music: be ready to recognize songs by how they sound, bitrate, length, etc. 'cause you won't see the title in a readable way. After a few months the cap started slipping off. They really should include a roll of tape in the set. After a year the start button began to malfunction, and image in the window shifted up about 1/4 of an inch, so track # and other info was no longer in the field of vision. In addition, the paint on plastic easily scratches. Back then the player used to cost $170. Today it worth of 30 bucks, I think it's a pretty good deal."
3,Good but a little incomplete,"The unit is compact, has a nice feature to attach the headphones to the unit so if dropped, all the weight doesn't fall on the jack. My issues are the manual talks about a radio function - which the unit doesn't have. And the unit has a telephone address book - which the manual or CD has no information on. Otherwise it's a very affordable system and you get great storage and MP3 capability for your bucks."
5,"Amazon Purchaser of ""A Beautiful Mind"" Brought Stark Insights on A Beautiful Wife","I loved reading the script of a Beautiful Mind so pre-Christmas I recorded the movie, and on Christmas Day I presented the disc and the copy of the script to My Beautiful Wife of more than 60 years. With the disc I wrote on page 117, the second last page of the script, ""To the light of my life. Thank you for me -- You are the Creator and Keeper"". The words on page 117 include: ""Suddenly there is no one else in the room,"" and Nash says ""Thank you for your belief in me after so many years. You are the reason I am here today."" Then we teared up while watching the film together. The script is so insightful and wonderfully presented and worth reading regularly, as my wife and I do, even if it's just a few pages at a time. Highly recommended.Donn Doyle"
3,Ok Case,"Destroys the beauty of the product. Protects very well (overprotects?). Lint magnet. If you're buying an old Nano at this point, just let it breathe, unless you need the belt clip."
2,disappointed,"the ring looked great when i first looked at it, but upon closer inspection, there was clearly a mistake made when soldering the ring together. there was a large silver blob on the ring. also, the ring did not spin properly. it would spin in one direction when using a great amount of force and would not spin in the other direction at all.on a positive side, the return process was quite simple and my refund was credited to my card quickly."
3,NO PRINTERS IN U.S.A.,PRINTED IN CHINA!HOW WOULD I KNOW IF CHANGES WERE MADE TO THIS PUBLICATION?BUY AMERICAN.....PRINT AMERICAN!
3,? A Question - When will the next edition be available?,"PLEASE DO NOT POST AS A REVIEW! Just to be clear, this is not a review.I was looking for a ""link"" to ask a question to the authors. I have used this book extensively in one of the classes I teach and the college is about to re-order for upcoming courses.I am reconsidering the choice because the internet advertising environment has changed significantly in 1 year and 3 months.When will 3rd edition be available? Please advise: thank you very much.LM"
1,dont waste your money,These tablets are awful. They smell just terrible and my dogs wouldnt even eat them. But I guess for $10 what can you expect. I'll stick with Fosters and Smith Joint Guard. My dogs LOVE those.
2,Peachtree glucosimine and condroiten,The product helped my dogs hips but it also discolored her white face and mouth. It was changed to a red hue. It looks like she has had beets. I am not using it any more; not that brand and we will see what happens with the new brand.
4,Seems like a good product,"As far as I can tell, it seems to be helping my dog's arthritis. She must like the flavor well enough since she eats them just fine, and she can be picky sometimes. Wish the tablets had MSM in them."
5,An absorbing and romantic interlude,"This is the first book that I've read by Donna Hill. I picked it up from the library purely by chance, and I'm glad I did.The romance between Kendra Phillips and Sean Michaels is a sure winner. Together they exude warmth, love and passion. Kendra is a lovely character with all the ambition of today's modern woman who allows her heart to be won by Mr.Sean Michaels, her soul-mate. Sean, the male lead, is portrayed in such a way that no African American male could rail against. He's intelligent, strong, handsome, and gentle. Also, he's compassionate enough to talk to Kendra when there's conflict between them and together they sort it out.Of course, sometimes that's not easy, but Donna Hill never humiliates her characters, rather she portrays them as men and women with flaws who sometime make mistakes. I am now a Donna Hill fan."
1,It is the worst thing I have used in my life,"It dosen't work properly, the buttons stop working after a certain time and it dosen't even do what I want it to do, sometimes, 1 out of 5, yeah, it works okay."
2,Poorly written,"This book would be a real asset had it not been so poorly written, over worded and unorganized. I think for the selling price the writer should have gotten a professional to help weed through it.As another commenter said ""get to the point"". I don't know if its over packed with useless paragraphs to help bulk up the book or not. I just feel that it could have been written in a much better way.Good information just a lot of digging and time wasting to weed it out."
5,Panasonic Stereo,This is a very nice stereo. It's a good price. You can have up to 5 CD's in it at once. You can also have 2 cassettes. It has both AM and FM radio. This is very cool. Comes with a remote.
5,GREAT TRUMPET---LOVE IT!!!!,"My son got this trumpet for Christmas and he wont put it down, or share it with Dad :-)He noramlly plays with a toy for a little while and moves on, but this trupmet is not far from his side all day."
3,Good enough for what we need,"Our daughter (6) asked Santa for a trumpet for Christmas and this is the only ""toy"" trumpet that was available for her age. We got the product in the mail and it was very cheaply made and we worry every time she uses it if it's going to break. It looks real enough, but isn't worth the money for the quality of the product. Very lightweight plastic and will probably break the first time she drops it on a hard floor, but at least Santa was able to deliver!"
3,"Nice simple, straightforward Alarm Clock","Not quite sure why having to unclip the battery cover is such a problem. I have had this alarm clock for over 2 years and have NEVER jarred the battery. This is a straight forward alarm clock with a nice backlight, snooze and all the jazz. It has been somewhat (**) accurate regarding temperature but seems to take a long time to change the display if moved to a room with a different temperature (or the inside of my computer case in this instance).Would need to be cheaper than the current price of $25 to qualify for more than the three stars I give it."
2,not easy to use,"control are tiny - the clock is tiny - they do a great job making it look bigger than it is, but it's about the size of a pack of gum"
3,Inaccurate description of size.,"Keyboard tray dimensions do not accurately reflect its true size. Even after allowing for the outside dimensions of the tray and the bracket it is still smaller than advertised. I like the height adjustment feature but would have preferred the keyboard tray to be wide enough to accomodate my keyboard and mouse. Outside dimension stated to be 30""W but infact it was only 27.75""W thus making the inside tray dimension only 25""W. Since I do not use a standard keyboard, this did not allow a comfortable work surface for both keyboard and mouse."
2,wilton swirly lollipop holder,"I bought this holder for cake pops but the reason it doesn't work is when you pick up a pop and raise it up to remove, it hits the pop above and won't lift out unless you pull it forward and up and it still won't clear the row above. It looks like the rows are staggared but not enough room to clear. Don't buy.Wilton Swirly Lollipop Holder"
5,Lord John Grey at his best,"A Warning to the Outlandish series readers: THIS DOES NOT HAVE JAMIE OR CLAIRE IN IT.This is a stand alone story about one of the secondary characters in the Outlandish series. I picked it up because I, like many others, was anxiously awaiting the arrival of book number five. While it is not about either Jamie or Claire, it shows John Grey in a way that he has not been shown before. In this story, he is the main character, and as such provides an extremely strong storyline. For me, it was wonderful to see a seconday character getting a story of his own. I only hope that she will write one about Roger..."
5,Why do Norwegians rock more than we do?,"Really! This is a travesty! Norwegian Vikings have plundered the sounds of Detroit Rock City and taken it back to Oslo with them, leaving us with the likes of Brittany Spears and Avril!Seriously, America needs to get the rock back fast before we are completely consumed by music that is written by robots for children!Oh, and Gluecifer kicks ass."
5,A Sincere and Personal Cd for Chayanne,"Chayanne's one of the biggest latin stars ,even though he has not made a real crossover he is known worlwide as a latin balladeer and as the great dancer he is!this cd shows his favorite personal sounds,not so dance oriented but more romantic and a little more ""rock "" than previous cd's.I still think he needs a new production team when it comes to his rythm and dance songs and to release his dance singles in more and different versions to get the attention of both the romantic and the dance comunity!Please contact Junior Vazquez,John Jellybean Benitez,Full Intention,Thunderpuss,Motiv 8,or any of the hottest remixers and release a Dance Remixed Cd of your Faves and you'll see the results!!!!!His ballads as always are beautiful and he gets into your heart with his soultry ,romantic voice...Although this is a very personal cd for him ,it's still a great one!"
3,"SINCERAMENTE,MUCHOS RELLENOS","SI CHAYANNE SE ASESORARA BIEN A LA HORA DE HACER CANCIONES MOVIDAS,SERIA UN CANDIDATO PARA GANAR LOS GRAMMYS..PERO NO LO HACE,COSA QUE AFECTA SUS DISCOS..SUS CANCIONES MOVIDAS SON TOTALMENTE VACIAS Y CARENTES DE SENTIDO,ENOJA PORQUE SON RELLENOS,CONTRARIO A SUS BALADAS QUE SON ENVOLVENTES,MADURAS Y BELLAS..DEBERIA EXPLORAR UN POCO MAS EN LO ELECTRONICO EN LAS MOVIDAS..MUSICALMENTE SU MEJOR DISCO:PROVOCAME."
5,Matt Nathanson has arrived!,"I've been a fan of Matt's music for about two years now, and could not be happier that he's getting the recognition that comes with a ""major label debut."" This disc of re-recorded older songs and some new tunes just works on every level. ""Curve of the Earth"" is my favorite track by far. I find myself playing it over and over. His lyricism is brilliant and heartfelt, and the lyrics and music combine to transport you to a place you don't necessarily want to go, but need to visit every once in a while-just to make sure you're alive."
5,not another mayer,"Matt Nathanson is so much better than John Mayer. I went to highschool with him, I've listened to his stuff since he first started. Still waiting for spring is a great cd, as well as ernst and not colored too perfect... buy this, you'll love it, his new one is just as good as the others. YAY Matt, great to see you on amazon and hear you on the radio!"
2,Short cord,"The charcoal starter I replaced had a 27 inch cord; this one has a twelve inch cord, necessitating use of an extension It does not seem to heat the charcoal as thoroughly at its predecessor, either. I'm not particularly satisfied with it."
1,Not for Mac,"Not good at all if you use a Mac. It didn't work with OS X 10.2. When I emailed Iomega tech support they said they don't support anything later than OS 9.1, and wern't too aplogetic about it. Too bad that OS went out of date almost 2 years ago. This might be a good drive, especially if it was still 1999, but it's 2002 and Iomega needs get with the game."
1,Very poor design...,"This water cooler has given us nothing but trouble and is very poorly crafted. The splash guard up top is so shallow that no matter how you tip the water bottle onto the stand, water goes all over the place. But that's not the biggest problem...it leaks. If you don't snap the levers back into place perfectly they drip (they also fill extremely cheap and flimsy). Twice I have come downstairs in the morning to have found the reservoir overfilled and our floor flooded, so I have to check it EVERY night to make sure that it is not dripping. Also, the spouts are positioned so close the the back that you can't use it to fill ice trays or sippy cups with a wide rim, the water just flows down the back.On top of everything, they sent us the wrong model, but we kept it only because it is SO expensive to return, and you have to eat that cost. Overall terrible experience with the product and the company who sells them. Please don't waste your money on ANY of their products!"
4,Bluebonnet Glucosamine Chondroitin purest formula out there,"I have tried many and none stack up to blubonnet. The formula is pure, not having many inactive ingredients.It is very effective. I started with one capsule a day which worked but have experimented and found that two capsules about every other day is very effective.The ONLY problem I have with this product is that it doesn't come directly from Amazon and takes almost TWO WEEKS to get here. RIDICULOUS!...but, until Amazon can come up with a better alternative, we're stuck...and for the time it takes, their prices could be better."
2,Pilates for Beginners and Beyond,Pilates for Beginners and Beyond is very boring and slow. I tried the workout once and put the DVD back into the box. It is a waste of your money.
2,ANNOYING instructors,"Unless you have a lot of patience, or don't mind using the dvd without sound, I would not recommend this. I'm pregnant and wanted to stay in shape but seriously, the instructor makes me want to grab her out of the tv and strangle her. These could be my hormones talking, but she has to be the most annoying human I've ever seen and heard. I have not turned it back on again because of how frustrated she made me feel."
5,Nice Pilates Set,"The three DVds include one that is to help you learn Pilates easily with modifications and is very good if you have not done Pilates, are new to it or just need more help while getting into shape.The second one has three levels from beginning to advanced and tells you what you are going to learn and how the moves are modified, changed or added at each level so you have a sense of things ahead of time.The last one is many exercises to do.There is alot here to keep you working out for a long time."
4,Great for everyone!,Really enjoy this set. It has a great beginners disc which is good for stretching and moderate to advanced which is great for sweating out some fat. Thank you!!
4,Easy to follow along,"These DVDS were easy to follow along to. I would have liked to see them with a better integration for the viewer, but still easy to follow."
3,Okay book,"This book was average, in my opinion. I haven't finished reading the book and I am hoping that it will get better as I complete it. I have read about two-thirds of it, so far. The one thought that was good was that he talked about what water shedding means and how snow looks the same on the top, but when it starts to melt, half goes one way and the other half goes the other way, going in two different directions. He compares that to today's churches."
3,Long Black Train by Josh Turner,"The song selection does not show case Josh's voice as well as the album, Your Man."
5,5 Star Train,Josh Turner has a very enjoyable album in the Long Black Train. His voice and musical style should be enjoyed by all.
4,Language,I loved it. Sometimes it seemed to drag on about nothing. But it dragged on beautifully I must say. It was the first Nin book I read and now I am on a binge. I loved her use of language and I related a lot to this book. It made me do some serious thinking.
3,Actually three and a half stars,"I don't have the book with me, and it's taken me a while to get through the whole book. Some of the entries I've already read in the anthology Blood Ties. I enjoyed the entries dealing with an elemental force being given a human body. The wizard enclave was amusing. I didn't care for the several stories centered around the thief Terizan. For me the thief element in fantasy is a little overdone.Overall it's an uneven anthology. With some stories not quite finding their narrative voice, while others sing with possibilitites."
3,Entertaining,"I watched this movie when recovering from surgery over two weeks. Fell in love with my introduction to Fado, so I purchased the CD the same day. It had a lot of instrumentals and only 3-4 Fado singers, and that is why I rated it 3-star. However, it does feature the musical pieces from the movie, so if you enjoyed the music from Passionada, this will not disappoint. I purchased CDs of legendary Fado singers separately."
4,Good stuff,"It's good to see new stuff out, even though I thought this album could have used a different title. Not as good as I expected, but still quite good."
4,An excellent collection,"If you are a fan of Tom Jones, you should like this CD. I am not a huge fan of his, but I like most of his big hits and a lot of his big hits are on this CD.My only real complaint was with the selection of some of the songs, but that is really just a matter of personal taste. I would have liked the classic 'Daughter of Darkness' and 'I'll Never Fall In Love Again' instead of 'Sexbomb' and 'Black Betty'. However, I was pleasantly surprised by 'Sometimes We Cry', so I guess they all don't have to be classic to be great! Like I said, it is really just a matter of personal preferences.Aside from that, this is a great CD. Jones is equally solid whether rocking (It's Not Unusual), belting out a ballad (Green Green Grass of Home) or something in between (Thunderball).This is a must for even casual fans of Tom Jones."
4,Tom Jones is excellent!,"If you like Tom Jones, you will love this CD. It has all the old favorites and some great new songs done with some excellent guests, such as The Cardigans and Portishead."
2,Nice watch but GPS is shaky,"I bought this for my wife as she was training for a 10 mile run. I have had success with Iron Mans, plus it was a petite watch with powder blue accents - perfect for a woman, and not some big thing she'd have to wear on her wrist. Watch and heart rate monitor worked great, but the GPS function was shaky - it dropped out and did not register the distance correctly. I returned the product and the rep told me that this model has been out for a while. I am thinking there is newer technology, and I hope Timex comes out with an updated model."
4,Very Impressed,"I was very happy with this book. Unlike many other guidebooks that are list-heavy and extremely soporific, this guide utilizes more of a narrative style that is fun to read yet retains a guide-like quality. It was very honest and excited me greatly for a trip I took last summer. One warning: the lists of hotels and restaurants are incomplete, but Rough Guides seek to give an overall feeling of attractions and not the details."
3,Be very gentle with this,"This is made with a material that requires careful handling.I am using it on my chair now, but it is fragile."
3,Medic Air Back Pillow,"I bought this item for more lumbar support. Very airy and not solid support. If you lean back into it the pillow deflates. Needs to be thicker to feel supported, like an air mattress thickness.Tamara"
3,Not a reliable product,The product held up and worked great for about 6 months then it formed tiny holes in it and now it slowly deflates. Save your money this product is not worth it.
4,Inflatable back pillow,I purchased this pillow for longer trips to give me lumbar support. It does a good job and covers a large area and is comfortable to use. Easily inflated and works well.
1,Switched Tape,"I was looking for a particular version of the movie ""Jack and the Beanstalk."" I was checking the picture on the box. I finally found one that matched the version I had (our tape broke) and ordered it. The seller sent a different version (not the one pictured). We did not care for this version because it was more of a narration of the story rather than the cartoon of it. It was not suitable for my deaf grandson. Sellers should send the product pictured in their ad and not switch the product."
5,Defends the role traditional Judeo-Christian values in the world,Values in a Time of Upheaval is a title perfect for modern times: a discussion in which the author defends the role traditional Judeo-Christian values in the world. His survey of the Christian faith and its place in a changing modern society of competing values and religions makes for an excellent review of his ideas and solutions on world problems and is a recommended pick for any Christian spiritual library interested in dialogues surrounding contemporary issues.
1,Piece of Junk,"This machine is a complete piece of junk. After installing the ink cartridge, the machines demands to print a page out. But the paper will not feed into the machine. In the meantime, the machine will not allow it to do anything else, such as receive a call, send a fax, or anything else. Utterly useless and a complete waste of money."
5,Background to the Candidates Snippets,"In spite of the heavy political name calling, the foundation for President Bush's preemptive attack in Iran has some justification under international law, as does prevention, regime change -- all under the guise of cooperative security. In January 2002, President Bush declared Iran, Iraq and North Korea an 'axis of evil.' By so doing, he has created options of how to deal with them.In this book, some 21 thinkers - from universities, think tanks, and governmental organizations all around the world have contributed articles discussing how to change these states for the betterment of the world community. These individual essays are collected together and edited by Lennon and Eiss of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.If you want to know more than the little snippets coming out of the candidates, this is a most interesting book."
2,dissapointing,"Very little (if any) Nei Kung can be found in this book. Mostly, it is a naive and self-indulgent autobiographical narration of the author's experiences with non-ordinary reality. As such it is a take it or leave it affair and, in the absence of practical information about chi practice, I am inclined to take the book as a yet another fairy tale. Danaos thus missed a chance to make his name as a Nei Kung teacher. Internal martial arts and energy work in general are amazing things and we need good books... however, this is not one for a serious practitioner. To people interested in learning more about Nei Kung I'd recommend any of the books written by Frantzis Kumar, a master with impeccable credentials and someone who does not play hide and seek with his readers."
2,Could it get any shorter?,"Content aside, just for the fact that a gathering of these folks is not going to produce poor quality music, but the length is so short that I don't think it meets modern day E.P. cd specifications. The price should have been at least halfed. Because that's what they delivered. And I think that's a stretch."
5,BBBBLLLLUUUU-RRRRAAAAYYYYY!!!!!,BBBBLLLLUUUU-RRRRAAAAYYYYY!!!!! Why no BBBBLLLLUUUU-RRRRAAAAYYYYY!!!!! You've Got Mail and Harry Met Sally are on BBBBLLLLUUUU-RRRRAAAAYYYYY!!!!! Why no Sleepless BBBBLLLLUUUU-RRRRAAAAYYYYY!!!!! BBBBLLLLUUUU-RRRRAAAAYYYYY!!!!! Why no BBBBLLLLUUUU-RRRRAAAAYYYYY!!!!! BBBBLLLLUUUU-RRRRAAAAYYYYY!!!!! Why no BBBBLLLLUUUU-RRRRAAAAYYYYY!!!!! thanks ; )
3,"Gets the job done, but not very comfortable","This product will give you a bed, but it defnitely isn't made for comfort. It's very hard and stiff. However, it's better than sleeping on the floor."
5,Every Pastor or Church Leader Should Read This Book,"This is a great book explaining why church membership is important and why churches should expect more of their members. The author makes a compelling argument for conducting membership classes (without calling them that) and communicating expectations to new members. He also gives good research into churches who have conducted these classes and have seen great results. The book has a practical aspect as well, showing people how to conduct these classes and giving good ideas on when they should be given. A very helpful book!"
5,Better than the last,Was introduced to Jack Johnson last year and been waiting for a new release. This was worth the wait. I normally need to listen to a CD a few times before I decide if I like it. I new on the first play.
1,On and On and On and On,"I found the music to be uninspired, repetitious, and just way too mellow. The breathy, overly earnest delivery just put me to sleep. He grabs a groove and just runs it into the ground, track after track. True auditory Valium."
3,"Excellent, but not on a par with ""Brushfire""","Jack does an admirable job on his sophomore effort, but one has to wonder about the songwriting. Some of the lyrics appear to have been afterthoughts, and on lyric in particular...""Blah, blah, blah, blah"" during ""Cocoon"" makes me wonder what the hell Jack was thinking...was he really in such a hurry that he didn't even want to bother creating a lyric for that line?????"
3,'On and On' indeed...,"I purchased this CD because 'Brushfire Fairytales' was such an amazing album that I couldn't pass on the follow-up. What I got was the same Jack Johnson as the previous album - no surprises, new techniques, nothing to really set it apart from his first release. What I got from listening to it just once through was ""wow, this sounds...just like the first album."" Not to say that this is a negative thing; but for the casual Jack Johnson fan, just one CD is probably enough, and I'd say 'Brushfire Fairytales' would be the better choice.'On and On' is the perfect CD to take on a weekend drive, to the beach, or just to listen to when feeling mellow, or aching to capture a carefree time in life."
5,even better?,"I dont know why, but I expected to be dissapointed by the next Jack Johnson album. I loved brushfire fairlytales, and I guess I just assumed he couldn't recapture that magic. But he did and then some. On first listen I loved this album. It runs together better then brushfire fairytales.. and I'd also say that the general quality of the songs is higher. I'd say hes progressing as a lyricsist and song writer. And he is not a bad guitar player either. Anyone who likes brushfire fairytales, or music, Or relaxing, Or beaches, Or love.. - get this album."
3,On and On...Exactly,"The title to this record is very appropriate...given that the songs go on and on with little variety. Don't get me wrong, I am a big Jack Johnson fan, but I wish he would branch out a bit and add a little more variety to his music. I enjoyed his first record more...however, the two are very (perhaps a bit too) similar. Definitely a great cd for the Summer, just put it on in the background and chill. However, don't expect to be struck by any phenomenal tunes...just laid-back, basic guitar and vocals. I would buy JJs first record before on and on."
1,On and on and on and on....,"Ideal for the days when you want to end it all. For when you hear this trite, insipid excrement you'll be desperate to stay alive as Johnson's bland music will surely be playing in the elevator that takes you to the Pit. And for the rest of eternity as you stoke Satan's furnaces.Don't buy this for your own good!"
2,it's okay,"Lots of old reworked songs here. Standouts are Taylor, Gone, Tomorrow Morning, Holes to Heaven. There are a few songs I found difficult to listen to...I think he could of made a more cohesive album by removing 4 or 5 of the 16 tracks. He's still one very talented guy, but I'm not blown away by this CD."
3,No Emotional Connection,"This album is a mostly acoustic album, with some of the songs sounding very similar to one another. The last couple of songs are sung in spanish. There are a few standout songs - ""couples must fight"" and ""springtime in new york"" but other than those two songs, i'd be hard pressed to remember another song title. The reason is because everything that made ""i'm so confused"" a great album is missing. No emotional connection, no full band sound, hardly any great lyrics. I am highly disappointed and I will be trading this CD in one day."
3,Did they mix up the name on this album?,"The bad news, this album just doesn't sound at all like Jonathan Richman, who is one of the most gifted musicians around. The good news is that I saw him in concert at the end of September in Chicago, and he still is one of the best.All I can think is that someone else is pulling the strings on this album, because it just doesn't sound like Richman, in that it is hurried, unemotional, and just plain loud.Very disappointing, but based on his live performance, this gentleman still has that certain something that he always has had. I'll just wait for the next one, and hope he fires his studio engineer."
5,Worth the wait,"I definitely give it a five star ratings. Especially as I discovered that among the audio language it has the french one, though this is not referenced in the technical info of this page. I hope the next seasons will be available soon"
3,Very '(S)VU-able',"I gave SVU a look because I'm such a fan of L&O;: CI - Detective Goran & Eames really blow up my dress. While I'm not as fond of Meloni and Hargitay, I do enjoy Belzer's interjections and pontifications profusely.Although the dialog of almost all the L&O; spinoffs seem like they are running a bit ""downhill"" to push the story along, it's a technique that I've learned to live with to serve my often short attention span. Hey, it's TV for cryin' out loud! It's a successful franchise and formula for good reason."
1,Inexplicably poor picture detracts from enjoying this set,"It's not VCD quality as someone else suggested. Instead, it looks more like an out-of-focus transfer from film. It's hard to understand how a mastering job such as this could be approved for release. I will view the entire DVD set regardless, but the poor picture most definitely detracts from the experience."
3,Wonderfully entertaining...,"What an entertaining twist... with Adam Baldwin hoping to pull off a quick divorce with his secret wife, Vonnie, so he can marry the sweet Beth Baylor... and Vonnie secretly furious at the entire affair. This story is full of misunderstandings, lack of communication, anger, rage, and a lot of passion. The main characters are warm, and loving, but I found it quite enterataining. I would recommend this story, however, did not find it a must read.... although quite enjoyable."
4,A good choice!,A light hearted book with cute characters. Vonnie Taylor and Adam Baldwin make a sweet pair with a stronge attraction to each other. A definite read for anyone looking for something to do other than watch TV.
2,not too great,Just finished with this book. Kept waiting for it to improve. Decent writing (maybe a 6 for writing) but a definite 3 for weak plot. Sigh.
2,A shot in the dark,"This book was filled with misinformation, and elitist viewpoints.I picked it up at a friends house, and was curious to their information within. I knew nothing of the authors, and now wished I knew less. The authors seemed to hold anime to the same critical highpoints Hollywood movies are, and don't seem to understand that; one, this is a different culture, and two, a lot of these were made for enjoyment, rather than Oscar-winning aspirations. In addition, production dates and biographies of makers are horribly inacurate.This really isn't the kind of book to hand to anyone that hasn't watched anime before. It would steer them from some highly watchable series before they had all the facts."
2,"Nice information, deeply flawed descriptions","When I heard that Helen McCarthy was working on an ``Anime Encyclopedia'' I was very excited. Her book on Hayao Miyazaki was excellent. When I finally got to see the finished product, I was very disappointed.I flipped through it looking at a few recent anime series (Crest of the Stars, Noir, NieA_7, even Serial Experiments Lain) with which I am familiar. Almost without exception, I found the descriptions to be appallingly inaccurate and mis-leading, such that I don't feel I could trust this book as much help in guiding a search for new series or new anime.That said, one very nice feature of this book is the inclusion of detailed staff information for series, which allows one to find other anime by the makers of series one likes. This feature alone makes this a useful book.My advice is: ignore the descriptions, and use the staff lists to explore the work of writers and directors that you like in greater depth."
3,little disappointed,"i like estee Lauder products. And i been buying fruition extra for years but for some reason these samples smelled funny and cream looked darker then usual. So maybe these samples were old. Because that never happened to me b4 when i bought it from the mall. But fruition is a great product, very sad that it has been discontinued"
4,Pacer Bumper Protector,"Works as explained,simple to apply and protects the bumper from those non-parking people who have depth perception problems when it comes to parking their cars. It will save you the aggravation of counting the dings and scratches on your bumpers."
5,lil stinker is a crowd pleaser!,This costume was perfect...I have a 25 lb pitbull puppy and ordered the medium to be safe...was a tad too big but still was able to fit it snugly enough that it didn't fall off on the walk.
2,"Cute, but not perfect","What they don't tell you is that this costume is just something to lay down over your dog's back. It velcros across the stomach, so if your dog is a wiggler, don't expect it to stay on. Also, the hood that is supposed to be the ears is supposed to go over your dog's ears, but there's no way it'll stay either. All in all, this is a cute costume in theory, but I don't think it's worth the money. Also, be warned, YOU CAN'T RETURN THIS if it doesn't fit. I learned this the hard way."
5,Can't wait for the 4th season!!!,"Hi guys,I've just finished watching the third series with my family, and we were so enthusiastic that as soon as we turned off the tv set we went on the internet to buy the next series from Amazon...Whoaaa, what a bad news! Please rush-up with the new dvd sets!!!Lorenzo - Italy"
2,Good Premise - Lackluster Execution,"The book has a promising start....playboy ends up in the bed of a spinster and ruins her reputation and puts his inheritance in jeopardy if they don't marry. An engagement ensues, and the couple is inevitably drawn together through a series of mini-plots. What made this lackluster was, the execution....it just didn't flow. The pace of building suspense just wasn't there for me. There were too many implausible mini-plots. The book could have been edited to keep it simple and flowing between scenes and characters. Not a bad read for a rainy day. Pleasant, but not gripping."
5,They Got Me Rocking Now!,"This is the ultimate collection of Stones concerts, taken from their 2002-03 tour. You can see three very different performances (one arena, one theater, and one stadium) from three very different places. The setlists are awesome, the band is in top form, and any Stones fan or collector is in for a real treat."
3,Curiosity Piece,"There isn't much by way of redemption for this oddball piece of cinema.A story about a crooked mafiosa hood played by (spaghetti western star) Peter Lee Lawrence who steals a shipment of arms,thus double-crossing his boss, Don Carmelo played by Adolfo Celi. The film is filled with unattractive,brutal misogynists.Picture and sound quality are quite good considering no remastering has been done here. Picture ratio is 2:35:1 widescreen. No added extras on disc. Bargain price,buy only if you are curious."
1,Nothing new,"I'm rarely disappointed in a book.This one arrived carefully shrink-wrapped and immaculate but the contents are nothing but a low-level compilation of the work of others. Maybe it's because I've worked on my family's Scots-Irish genealogy for almost 20 years.....but with other authors I'm constantly finding new information and it's documented, which much of Kennedy's isn't.The editing also leaves much to be desired. 'new England' and exclamation points stuck in any old place and several lines that are printedwithoutanyspacesbetweenthe words are just some examples.And I think I'll ask my reading specialist daughter to do a reading level assessment of this book. I'll wager it'll come out appropriate for upper middle school.I'm glad I didn't order the several others of his I was tempted by when making my decision. Disappointing. A pot boiler."
3,Blair Witch Style Works Well.,"This is another movie seen through the eye of a camcorder. It takes place beneath the city of Sydney Australia as a news crew illegaly sneaks into tunnels to try to find evidence of the homeless living there. A city water project that doesn't seem to make much sense is on hold because of people disappearing within the tunnels and fear of killing homeless people who may or may not be living deep within the underground tunnels. The news team is believable and the setting is quite spooky. This is a movie that practices the less-is-more technique. It pays off pretty well when the group is being herded and chased by an unseen danger. No real explanation is ever given as to just what the menacing barely seen creatures are, but the direction and acting are enough to suspend any disbelief. Good script, tight direction and good story make this one worth watching."
4,Moondance Alexander,I rented this movie for my daughter and she loved it. She asked if I would buy it for her--so I did.
4,Nice Product,"I have been using a Palm Device since the old Personal Palm unit. Althought I loved my Personal Palm I didn't utilize it as much as I would have liked. There are only so many address, to do, and calendar entries once person can have. If I was going to upgrade my Palm I wanted it to have more funtionality.With this is mind I decided on the Palm Vx and the Omnisky Wirless. Once received I went ahead with the setup of my account/modem and found it to be very straight forward with no issues. I setup my outisde POP3 email account with no problems.The performance of the wireless modem is very good, download times are pretty quick. The content of the service is good with plenty of news, weather, sports, and other usefull information. Web site viewing is best with Omnisky content partners. I have not had much luck going out to other web sites but I wasn't expecting a lot in that catergory.Overall I think this is a great wireless unit and service plan...."
4,comes in handy,"I like the omnisky accessory. I have a Palm Vx which I love. I do not own the omnisky yet but I have used it. It is great when you need info fast (email, directions, stocks, food, etc...). I like this method much better than the Palm VII's wireless aceess. The downside is the price. But when you need it for work and they pay, who cares about $$?"
2,Had a problem with my Vinyl,I love the killers and wish i wouldn't have gotten a scratched vinyl. that's the only thing that ruined it of course =(
5,"BEST KILLERS ALBUM AND WOW, WHAT A RECORD!",This is a limited edition Picture Disc LP. Its amazing just to look at. Not your standard vinyl record. You'll really be impressed with this piece in your collection!Looks and sounds great!
4,Interesting Book,"This is the first book I've read by Sandra Hill. I love time travel romances, so I decided to give it a go. Right off, I was laughing my head off. The dialogue between the main characters is funny, sensual and gets very EROTIC. Rafe had me blushing with some of the stuff he said to Helen. I did get somewhat annoyed though with their continual arguing though. For the first half of the book, it seems that is all there doing is fighting, with Rafe baiting Helen, and Helen sprouting horns and bossing him around and giving orders. Its gets better though once they confess there love to each other. Then the sex teasing is on the prowl. What I thought was interesting though, was to have not one, but two people from our time travel back together into a totally alien time and see how they fare. At least they had each other. I would recommend this book to a friend who wanted a good laugh and definently wanted to get hot and bothered under the clothes!!!"
4,Can't go wrong with Sandra Hill,I really enjoyed this book. It is a time travel book in which both the hero and heroine go back in time. It was a lot of fun.
5,AWESOME,"This is an excellent collection. I really love it. Such a fair price for it and also I received it sooner than I had anticipated. But that is always with AMAZON, they are terrific."
4,It would be perfect except for Track 10.,"Wow, this is good music. It's beautiful, happy, and well-written. A great choral sound full of brilliantly triumpant songs, utlizing a vast array of instruments. Track 9 made me so happy that I ordered the album from Amazon within nanoseconds of being exposed to it.The one flaw, and it's a big one, is Track 10. Thirty-six minutes of repetative, monotonal noise. If it was five minutes of noise, or even six, that would have been acceptable. At thirty-six minutes, it seems almost arrogant. At least it'll be a great tune to put on if I need to clear out a room after a party. I still love the album, but I would have given it five of five if it weren't for the final assault on my ears. Still - I highly recommend this album."
4,Aural somthing...,"Good stuff... minus the last track. This actually is the demo cd for the band that was recorded in three days. Quite good for three days. You must see a live Polyphonic Spree show to get to really appreciate this band. But, the CD is a great listen especially after a live experience. They have a few singles out. But, I can't wait for their new CD expected to be released this Fall."
1,review by a student,"I am a undergraduate student studying economics. This textbook is awful, it lacks details, insights and necessary algebra and diagrams are often wrong.I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Poorly written and biased,"I agree with most of the reviewers.- The writing is horrible and takes a long time to read each chapter- For anyone studying economics at the intermediate level, calculus should be required and this book does not have any of it- Very political and biased which I would not expect from an economics text- An unacceptable amount of typos and mistakes for a published text with editorsI would be interested if anyone has any alternative suggestions to this text that follow the same micro-foundation approach?"
2,"Strange, strange choices","This is not the translation by Arthur Waley (which is very good) but the one by D.C. Lau. Since Lau's translation was first published, a number of advances have been made in the field of Warring States Period scholarship which render a fair amount of the supporting material obsolete (see ""The Original Analects"" by Brooks and Brooks for the latest). As for the translation itself, it's rife with awkward and mystifying word choices -- for instance, in a passage in chapter 11 in which the disciple Zilu (Tzu-lu, in Wade-Giles romanization, which Lau uses) gets the better of Confucius in an argument, Waley translates the Master's retort, ""It is remarks of that kind that make me hate glib people,"" and the Brookses and Huang Chichung make similar choices; but Lau renders it, ""It is for this reason that I dislike men who are plausible."" Similar mishandlings of connotation appear throughout the book. For an old-fashioned translation, Waley's is a hundred times better."
2,"Well-written, but biased","This is a reasonably well written, but undeniably biased tale. The statistics are slanted and untrustworthy, and the rhetoric is tough to wade through for anyone on the pro-rights side of this issue."
1,"good service, disappointing book","The service was prompt and good. The book was in the condition advertised, but I wouldn't have bought it if the information about it had included that the oldest son Adam was not only left out of the tale, but unmentioned in any way. Otherwise, there is much better fan fiction on the web!"
5,mushroomhead will alwayz rule,"xiii has a great sound from alot of other bands,its heavy & mellow at the same time,it put u in just the right mood to jam.so just buy it and find out for yourself.(if u have a chance to go see them live GOOOO they sound just as GOOD."
3,NU METAL!!!??,"If this is nu metal than, Nu metal is awesome. Down tuned guitars, melodic/rapcore/vocals. ( red hott chili peppers, meets coal chamber) great combination. But if your looking for a cannibal corpse, or in flames type album, you'll be dissapointed. Mushroom head is not, death metal, or even metal, but they are easy on the ears. The albums highlights are : Sun doesn't rise at all ( featured on the freddyvsjason soundtrack), Kill tomorrow, mother machine gun, and nowhere to go. Best album from mushroom head yet. A must have for die hard fans, but for true metal fans, you might want to stay away."
5,XIII,"With a pleathera of great songs and two amazing lyricists, I didn't know what to expect from the new Mushroomhead album except that it was going to be good. I didn't know if it would top XX or any of their previous work. But once again, Mushroomhead expands and shows their talent of writing excellent material and exposing the deeper and darker side of life. XIII is a example of the future of metal and I hope that this band will stick around for many years to come."
3,Had to cut the handle off the plug,"Connecticut Electric CESMPS54HR 50-Amps/120240-Volt RV Power OutletWe ordered this plug along with the recommended 50 amp RV Power Outlet, and low and behold the box would not close because of the handle. In fact, even after we cut the handle off, the box barely closed. These 2 products are not compatable and should not be ordered together."
5,Good quality,Handle makes it easy to plug in and pull out works well on my generator easy to install wire to electric pole plenty of room inside to make all connections.
3,Does the job.,"Kinda light, but does the job. We'll see how long it lasts. Just wish it was made in this country."
5,RV Plug 30 Amp,"Works great, just make sure you have the proper tools for the electrical line to connect the adapter. Pretty heavy wire for 30 amp."
5,Best of Law and Order Series,"The Law & Order franchise gets better with each installment. Criminal Intent is brilliantly crafted and acted. Goren is the most interesting character to come along in a long while, and Vincent D'Onofrio is hypnotic. Kathryn Urbe's Eames is a perfect foil. Criminal Intent is the best of the L&O stable. Don't miss this first season!"
2,Didn't run,All I can say about this game is that you BETTER have a AWESOME computer to run it. I recently bought a new computer and I met all the system requirements for the game (even beat the requirements by 2) and this game did not run worth a crap (It was very laggy on all LOW settings) so I had to take the game back. It's kind of dissapointing because it seems like a great game to. So people make sure you have a very up to date computer and make sure you buy more RAM if you want to play this game.
1,This game is terrible,"This is the worste game performance I have ssen. It slows down so much you can't help but to just turn it off. Your money would be better off used to start a beach party bon fire. This coming from Microsoft go figure? I will never buy a Microsoft Title again. It Overwhelms your system so much, all the ram and graphics power you throw at it wont help. Please pass it up. Mine is going up for sale for what ever i can get for it."
1,Not compatable with video card on my Sony VAIO,HALO was not compatable with the video card on my Sony Vaio; and this is the only software that I have had this problem with.
3,Halo for the PC,Having played both Halo and Halo 2 on the X-Box there are details that were left out of the PC version that made me appreciate the greatness of those games all the more. Lack of Coop play was the biggest and in playing singleplayer the quality of the animations was definitely wanting.But then there is the excellent Halo multiplayer fan base that has created so many mods under the CE version that can be downloaded for free and provide hours of frustration while they collectively kick my butt! Combine that with the reasonable price and I think I can say this is definitly an excellent introduction to the world of Halo.PS: If you are reading this and haven't played Halo or Halo 2 on the X-box - you now feel the compulsion to go do this - go now and do my bidding ... muhahahaaaaaa.
2,Uh... What's the big deal?,"Look, I know how much some people love this game, but even after the first few levels I knew it just wasn't for me. I dunno. P'raps I'll try it again sometime."
2,Great on Xbox... not on P.C.,"Ive had this game for a while.. and... well.. here it is. The game sucks on P.C. The only reason i say the xbox version is good is because xbox graphics, games, and reputation is 100% absolute CRAP when compared with the gaming P.C., and the best game xbox has is the halo series. But for the P.C. gamer... its not that good. Its extremely linear, the weapons are pretty boring, and the graphics suck(when compared with todays P.C. games). The only reason I played this game is because its the only game on my shelf with a semi-solid plot. So, all in all, if your looking for a kick-ass P.C. game, don't get Halo P.C."
3,Too late to be a classic,"When Bungie worked on Halo for the Mac many years ago, it probably had an opportunity to produce a game destined to become a classic. Then they sold themselves to Microsoft - interviews at the time left the issue equivocal if there would be a Mac version. PC users, knowing Bungie's reputation, had reason to rejoice. But M$ positioned Halo to support it's profitless Xbox and deliberately delayed development of a PC version. And it shows. Despite some additional bells and whistles not implemented for the Xbox, it is not particularly innovative for a game of 2003-2004. Halo is burdened with being just another first person shooter. It is well done for what it is but not better than other FPS games and it is hard to justify adding it to one's collection. Maybe Halo 2 will be the ""next big thing."" Halo 1 is not."
1,"Halo freaks, get over it","I am typing this review long after the game comes out (by years). THIS GAME STINKS! If you want a good FPS, try Unreal Tournament or Medal of Honor! I know, ""what are you talking about, Halo rocks!"" is most peoples' reaction when you say stuff like this, but get over it! The game is stupid!"
3,get it for free online,the game is good but you can get the halo trial online for free intire game free but the multiplayer map is blood gulch i dont have it but i have heard of it
2,Halo,"I'm a big fan of shooters, But I wouldn't recommend this game the game play sucks the animation looks like a 3rd grader drew it with crayons. If you want a good shooter go with Battlefield 2, Delta Force Xtreme, or even Call of Duty"
4,Keeps You Busy,"This is a pretty good game even though it's somewhat dated. I particularly liked the large variety of alien enemies and the ample weapons choices. For me, the big plus to this game is that there are a few cut scenes and that they are brief. My only critique is that the dialogue was somewhat difficult to hear and that I couldn't figure a way to turn on subtitles. But, all in all, I recommend this game highly. It's a great bargain."
1,Halo has the most bugs ever... for any game....,"Athlon 1300384MB RamATI 120MB 9000 videoXP ProfessionalIt was bad enough a year ago to find out that Halo was going to be for XBox before PC. So when I finally got to buy it, I installed it and I can't play it without going into ""safe mode"" for the game. I updated all drivers and still it crashes my computer. This is the WORST game I've ever not had the chance to play. I won't be buying any more Microsoft games until I read reviews first. Save yourself and go buy something else instead."
5,HALO RULES ALL!!!!!!,Halo by itself made X-Box the best selling video game system but for computer it will far surpass X-Box gameplay. Halo for PC incudes all of Halo for X-Box plus:*Banshee in multiplayer mode.*6 new multiplayer maps.*New guns.*And multiplayer experience without puchacing anything extra.I can tell all of you one thing now. This game is going to be gold. Do not pass this offer. BUY HALO FOR PC!!!!!!!!!
3,Disapointed!,"In the past, I've always been very happy with Panasonic products, but not this time. I needed a DVD recorder, and liked the idea of the hard drive and TV Guide programing. Well, what they won't tell you in the info, is this unit doesn't work with DISH, as to accessing the programing. You can still program manually, but it's certainly no TiVo.Second---the manual isn't at all well organized. It's full of information, but to perform one function, you have to search the whole booklet. Also, it doesn't seem to be as easy to edit material as was my previous Pioneer.The only saving grace is the quality of both recording and playback. It does a great job of recording. The hard drive, on SP is very high quality, and the high speed copy to the DVD transfers great quality in the copy. These qualities are the only reason why I gave this unit 3 stars."
3,Does Everything Well Except...,"It doesn't have a component video input. This means if you have HD cable or HD satillite signal, you can't record it in HD. It does everything else wonderfully, but I was disappointed when I upgraded to HDTV and couldn't record HD content."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased the Panasonic DMR-EH75VS DRD Recorder as a gift. It was pricey. I figured the best is the best. Instead it didn't work!!!! It was only in Spanish. But that wasn't the problem. Nothing worked!!!! My son called and yes, it is under warranty but the store that was recommended to repair it, doesn't have the parts. So we are in a waiting mode. Before I know it, it will be February, I purchased this the beginning of January. Guess the best, isn't the best."
1,NOT THE RIGHT ITEM,"I ordered this item twice and twice I got the wrong thing. I wanted the 1=Gallon Elite but got the Igloo Legend Beverage Cooler both times - INCORRECT ITEM!! As noted in other reviews, I wanted the shorter, wide-mouthed thermal jug for my dogs for agility training. Instead I received a tall, thinner jug with ""Igloo Legend"" on it. Not what I ordered TWICE!!! I ordered it for a Christmas present, ordered in plenty of time TWICE and still am without the gift. I would not recommend dealing with this company."
1,Don't buy,Brand spanking new it will leak all over you when you take a swig out of it. I do like the compact design that won't turn over like the colemans do but all igloo jugs leak around the spout. Don't buy igloo unless it is one with a thumb button valve on the botgtom!
3,lets have a drink,"A great cooler, only wish it had a handle on the side. Had one before that did same size and it's better with it."
5,Nice bucket....for fishing!,"Very practical for me. This is the size you want if you're looking for a minnow bucket for ice fishing. Many people here in MI use these in the dead of winter for ice fishing because...1) They don't leak; you can attach them to a sleigh, snowmobile or four wheeler and go. 2) The water doesn't freeze up. The water stays a constant temperature 3) Holds about 3-4 dozen walleye minnows...although 2 dozen is common for me.I know this is out of the ordinary, but it's practical."
1,Deception,"I wanted the igloo in the photograph, wide mouthed and low so that my dogs can drink from it without tipping the jug. The Jug that was sent is tall and thin. Not what I ordered."
1,Leaks on you while you drink,We bought this for our daughter to use during color guard. It leaks on her every time she drinks from it. She says everyone in the band has the same one and that they all leak.It leaks because it doesn't have a rubber seal in it.I called Igloo and they told me that they are no longer using a rubber seal and that I couldn't buy a rubber seal since they are discontinued. Why would they do this? I am not sure but if you are having the same issue please call Igloo and complain so maybe they will decide to start making a quality product again.
2,OMG what a pain!,"OMG what on earth type of cheap Chinese nuclear glue did you use for the labels on this thing???? Removing the labels leaves a sticky residue that is freakin' impossible to remove!! I've been scrubbing it with 100% pure alcohol (not rubbing alcohol) and the glue barely budges. I'm going to have go for Acetone or something, this is ridiculous! If I just leave it on, it will attract all the grass and dirt that my son will invariably expose it to at band camp! Handle? It doesn't need one, just remove labels, stick hand to glue, lift and drink!!!! I've removed thousands of labels from products over the years but I've never had to invest noticeable time from my life to do it!"
2,"Quite Frankly, A Boring Album","I've not exactly thought of Amy Grant as an exciting performer, but I practically had to get out my stethoscope to measure the pulse on this album! I can't honestly think of a single track that I would recommend to a friend. Amy's singing seems to have gotten more and more lethargic; her voice sounds a lot lazier and muddier than it did 10 years ago. The way she slides between words instead of articulating them more clearly is becoming increasingly annoying. And, ""Beautiful"" -- the duet with twanger Vince Gill-- after hearing it, I had to go scratch my fingernails over the chalkboard a few times just to regain my sanity!! I had hoped that in 6 years that Grant would have been able to put together a more refreshing sound than she has. Amy, honey, it's time to put together a new production team and start over!!"
3,Hoping For More,Having been anticipating all of Amy's albums since 1985...this one left me wanting more. I feel like the songs all sound similar. It's not my favorite album of hers.
2,Couple Good Songs-Otherwise Bland,"While this CD contains a couple of enjoyable songs, it seems as if Amy Grant has lost her magic. Whatever happened to the masterpieces that Amy Grant used to sing and create.... songs like ""I Will Remember You"", ""Angels"", ""El-Shadai"", ""Sing Your Praise"", ""Baby Baby"", ""Say Once More"" and the list could easily go on. Her ""A Christmas Album"" is still easily one of the best Christmas albums ever recorded. (right up there with Bing Crosby's ""Merry Christmas""). Maybe it's just a stage, but it seems as if Amy lost her zeal and passion.While I wouldn't call this album horrible, I would call it forgetable and it lacks the passion and creativity of her earlier songs."
5,Amy at her best,"Although Amy's latest album, SIMPLE THINGS, is somewhat faith-based, most people think that her most recent faith-based album is LEGACY...HYMNS & FAITH (2002). But this is an excellent CD. &quot;Simple Things&quot;, the title track, shows Amy Grant's desire to have a simple life. Going to work, watching TV, playing games with your children, and going to church on Sundays. But it doesn't matter what life she has, Amy Grant will still have the &quot;simple things&quot;."
2,Bland things,"While Amy Grant is not the best singer in the industry, her musicianship and lyrical ideas usually make up for that weakness. However, on this latest album, even those two advantages cannot make up for the fact that she sounds worse than ever. Maybe she needed to clear her throat before hitting the studio, or has been ill-advised that the ""hoarse and husky"" sound is the latest vocal trend. Listening to earlier albums like ""Straight Ahead"" indicate that she really could sing at one time, but this newest release pales in comparison to the vibrancy of earlier recordings."
3,"Tepid CD, but vicious reviews","I think people have a point that the CD is a little lame, by Amy's standards, though granted I think she's the greatest thing ever. This doesn't live up to what she is known for. But as for all the insipid commentary on her personal life, what a bunch of idiots. So insecure and immature. Those are the type of people who give Christians a horrible name sometimes. No one wants to hear you hypocritcal moralizing on a CD review website for goodness sake. Go burn some books somewhere. The question is how was the CD. The comments are somewhat entertaining, but I'd be embarassed to be some of these fools shouting their mouths off so ignorantly."
5,Simple Things - Amy Grant,"As always, Amy Grant is wonderful! I love both her pop & Christain music! She's a blessing to the music industry & a treat to all of her fans!"
2,Bland and Overproduced,"For those of you giving this a positive review, could you actually HEAR her voice? Because I could barely discern her vocals from the overproduction running rampant on this album. I was very very disappointed, and could only find one song (Eye to Eye) that was remotely listenable (thus 2 stars, instead of 1). Her album before this one, Behind the Eyes, was phenomenal...and having heard that type of brilliance, I was unprepared for the letdown."
3,Nice kite...but,"I have this kite. I technically still have it, but it is sitting at the top of a tree where I can't get to it.So my replacement kite was a Prism Quantum (which I got from Amazon as well). Night and day. The Quantum is so much nicer than the 'Go Fly A Kite' kites. If you look around at all the top kite manufacturers, the Go Fly a kites' don't ever show up.It is a fun kite, but you can do so much more with the Quantum at only $68 from Amazon."
3,compound miter saw,"I have owned this saw for about ten years, and have used it alot. It is very accurate and easy to use. If I was buying one today, I would buy a sliding compound miter saw. The 12 inch saw can't cut the whole way thru bigger 2x lumber at a 45 degree angle."
4,good saw,Just bought about a week ago and I'm very satisfied. I use it daily in my business where accuracy is a must. This saw delivers. Only draw back is the blade. Get a better one if you are doing finish work.
3,"those magnificent men in their flying machines, they go up up up up, they go down down down down ...","a pleasant enuf biopic of early rock & roll icon buddy holly, portrayed here by the bizarre gary busey. ive always suspected that holly was one of those artistes fortunate to have died young before people realized in the none-too-distant future that his talent was limited. the movie is a fine way to spend two hours tho i doubt id ever feel the need to see it again."
3,BUDDY DESERVES A BETTER MOVIE!,"""The Buddy Holly Story"" is a good film,but the story never really digs deep or leads us anywhere except to the inevitable end. Busey does get brownie points for doing his own singing and he plays his part well. It's a good film, but watching it back to back with ""La Bamba"" it pales in comparison. The DVD had a ""this has been formatted to fit you TV screen"" warning before the movie?? even though it states widescreen on the case.??? The transfer looks very good and the soundtrack was rocking!"
3,"Before Joaquin Phoenix brought a Country legend to life, Gary Busey brought a Rock 'n' Roll legend to life","He was born in Lubbock, Texas, he dated a girl named Cindy Lou, he rocked the nation influenced by Elvis Presley & he is one of the most important figures of American pop culture, his name is Buddy Holly & this is his story. Gary Busey stars in the title role of the late rock 'n' roll legend in this telling of his rise to fame in only two years & his tragic plane crash with Richie Valens & Big Bopper recording rock classics like ""That'll be the Day"" ""Peggy Sue"" ""Oh Boy!"" ""Rave On"" ""Maybe Baby"" & 5 more hit songs. If ya your Buddy fan see ""the Buddy Holly Story"""
5,Buddy Holly will never fade away.,"Gary Busey fantastically portrays Buddy Holly and about his unfortunately short but super-incredible career. Some of the charcter's names and some events have been cahnged, but that's n reason not to enjoy this wonderful story of a rock'n'roll legend.Busey recreates Holly's greatest hit songs such as ""That'll Be The Day, ""Rave On"", ""Rock Around With Ollie Vee"", ""Peggy Sue"", ""Oh Boy"", ""Maybe Baby"", ""It's So Easy"", ""Words of Love"", and ""True Love Ways"". The final moments are chilling, but the storytelling is incredible. Buddy Holly is gone, but not forgotten and Gary Busey proves that here in ""The Buddy Holly Story."""
1,VERY disappointing,"I really wanted to love this coffee. I loved the Kona coffee I drank during trips to Hawaii, and I love dark roasts. I saw SO many amazing reviews about this coffee on Amazon that I ordered some beans.They showed up, I threw them in my Bialetti and... ""ughhh"".... Nothing special at all... So, I threw them into my Coffeemaker and.... ""ughhh"" again...A total waste of monty - well maybe not a total waste, at least I got a few cups of mediocre coffee for my money."
3,somewhat disappointed,"The product is quite bitter, so much so that the bitterness overshadows the flavor of the coffee. I may have to experiment with it by decreating the amount of coffee used, or perhaps blending these beans with a weaker coffee."
1,14oz is not the same as 16 ! !,"I bought a 16 oz. bag in November, and now the description says 14 oz, yet the item number is the same (!). I used the Subscribe & Save option, and it looks like I'm paying for 14% less coffee at the same (inflated) price. This is a classic Bait & Switch tactic, and I don't appreciate the reduction in size. Beware !"
5,An Enjoyable Gift!,A friend of mine who knows that I am a big coffee drinker sent me a one pound bag of the dark roast. Now I know why he is my friend! I drink a pot of coffee a day (don't tell my wife!). I tend to lean towards Sumatra or Italian.This has been a nice and enjoyable change for me! Give yourself a treat and try this Kona (You may even want to give it as a gift!)
3,Mastech Ms8229,Cheaply made. good for price paid. alittle confusing to use. I should have stuck with the fluke meter.Has alot of uses though.
2,Okay Children's Movie,"I had purchased this movie for pre-teens and they were quite bored with the stilted acting and with the obvious ""horse switching"" from scene to scene. Overall an okay movie for the 10 and under crowd."
5,Great Movie!!,"If you're a horse lover and like english riding style you'll love this movie!!! Lighting, the beloved stallion is beautiful!!!! Lighting gets stolen, then the horsenabber who nabbed him has a accident, he loans him to a nice girl who immediatley falls in love with him. She goes to 2 shows and places Great in both, then she finds out Lightning is stolen and helps get him back to his real home. REALLY GOOD MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,good but...,This album has a nice hippy feel to it. Nice and easy listening but Edie just can't sing. If she could I would buy her album.
4,Gets better and better,"Like the most recent reviewer states, this album just gets better with repeated listenings. It still reeks of Edie's easy, breezy lyrics and crafty, delicious melodies, in the best way, but in more subtle, nuanced, cohesive ways.I just picked this album up again after a break, and continue to be entranced and surprised by its sexy, seductive sophistication. Its songs creep up on me...before I know it, a song I merely liked before up and confronts me with its smart charm. Like Meryl in Prada, Edie doesn't need to shout (vocally or in production) to make her points...she's still got the goods and trusts them.Most recently, I've also been taken by the cross-pollination of Manhattan singer-songwriter and Texas folkie energies. At once I feel like I'm in a cool, divey East Village hangout and...a cool, divey Austin venue.Great work, pure and simple."
1,Completely Pointless,"This has to be the worst DVD ever made. Get the uncensored version if you MUST get it. Even if the nudity was uncensored it would still be terrible, it would just have some perks. I got this off Netflix thinking how it would have a lot of good bands in it and it would be so cool, interviews and all that. but they're not even interviewing, each band tells about sexual preferences and stupid stuff that even a fan doesnt need to see.If you're still interested, these are the so called ""Interviewed"" celebsJohn Davis (Korn)Fred & Wes (Limp Bizkit)Insane Clown PosseNashville P*ssy (??)Sugar RayMatt ZaneCoal ChamberClint (Sevendust)El Duce (The Mentors)Lemmy (Motorhead)Tura Sanata311Alkaholicsand a very bad music video : ""Nobodys-Addicted"""
2,Pretty but tacky,"I was embarassed, but it was Year of the Tiger and was having trouble finding attractive Tiger jewelry for my girlfriend, at any price. In desperation I bought this, because the design was rather elegant. But it is very thin, even bends easily. Tacky."
4,Ultimate LEGO fan service,"Older brickheads and young Lego enthusiasts alike will have a blast with this highly enjoyable LEGO adventure on DVD. My son had a grand time spotting his toys amongst the action of the overall superb animation (especially the backgrounds). The story is fun and jumps around the LEGO universe in a ridiculous fashion, the humour is overall perfect for the age group this is aimed at and fun for those still young at heart. The feature presentation is well worth the admission price but for another awesome experience check out the 6 min stop motion Space Police mini movies in the extras it is really cool and fun to watch the actual toys come to life in a way that my son and I have attempted on our own with the PS3s eye movie software. The kiddies are gonna hit the repeat button on this one, a must buy for the brick clicker in your house."
5,WAYYYY COOL!!!!,"nice, clean, kid friendly, well written entertainment without the raunchy and inappropriateness of shrek or madagascar. would LOVE to see more of CLUTCH and his team in MORE adventures. Seriously, what's not to like?"
5,HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK. I AM ABOUT HALF WAY THRU. VERY DETAILED TELLING WHAT THEY WENT THRU,TRAVELLING BY CAR STARTING IN 1929 THRU OUT THE UNITED STATES. THE PRICE CANT BE BEAT ALSO."
4,Company went belly-up,"Unfortunately SportBrain went under. I wish somebody would design a program to enable use of the SportBrain without connecting to the company's defunct site. Save your money until the company revives, if it does."
4,Just the motivation I need,"I have had my sportbrain for about 3 months, and I really look forward to viewing my data every day. I have increased my daily goal twice because I'm walking more and find that this is just the incentive I needed to get me moving more. I'm highly motivated to make my goal every day. One night, in fact, I realized at 11:30pm that I was 300 steps short of my goal, so I went for a 10 minute walk and ended up well exceeding my goal!I also really like the fact that it's not computer OS dependent and my data is viewable from where ever I happen to have access to the internet."
1,They're Out of Business !!!,"The SportBrain was a great idea and a very easy device to use. The problem is you upload your data onto their machine and review it from their website. Now they are out of business (as of 7/30/01). Go to their website - their assets are being liquidated to pay off creditors. Maybe someone will buy the service.The answer is to find a similar product that downloads, stores and analyzes the data on your own computer, so you do not become dependent on the seller's system. I'm looking for that solution right now."
1,RIP OFF!,"I give this product one star because there is no selection for none. I got one of these for x-mas and it worked great for two days, then the website went down and I haven't been able to access it ever since. There are no telephone numbers to call, no email addressed to mail. Not to mention that there is no indication on the box that this is a product that requires a membership of $14.95 per month to use. Do not waste your money and get discouraged! Buy a different pedometer and keep track of the results yourself."
1,"Buyer Beware!! Company is gone, and item is non-funtional",This item is non-funtional. The company and web site needed to make the product work are bankrupt and useless.
5,Up and running!,"SportBrain is a great tool for anyone who is interested in a little motivation to get moving. The website was offline for awhile but as of December 2002, they are back up and running. The one big change is a user fee, but I still think the small amount they are asking to use the site is really worth the information and motivation you get from the little gadget. Give it a try and you'll be hooked. I can tell you that I am addicted - my kids are less than thrilled because now I park as far away from the store as possible just to get a few extra steps. :-) Highly recommended."
5,Great cutlery,Lovely simple design. No problems with the dishwasher yet. Lets you grip well. It is surprisingly difficult to find good cutlery and for this price these are excellent.
5,Best with Ken Blanchard's name on it,"I've enjoyed Ken Balnchards resources through the years, like the One Minute Manager, but I have to admit: I'm not a huge fan of the parable-only books. This book breaks from that tradition to provide a more standard learning format and is filled with amazingly valuable and life changing information.I loved the five habits in the chapter titled ""The Habits of a Servant Leader"":1) Solitude2) Prayer3) Study and application of Scripture4) Accepting and responding to God's unconditional love5) Involvement in supportive relationshipsI think ""accepting and responding to God's unconditional love"" is a very big issue for many Christians today. Sometimes we forget that He loves us and cares for us - not the perfect us we'd like to be.I think you'll enjoy this book, but you should know - as is obvious from the title - it certainly has a Christian slant to it. If this is fine with you - as it is with me, you'll love the book.Tom Carpenter"
1,Panned it,"You CAN judge a book by its cover artwork. Yes, the cover art is supposed to make one think of Seattle grunge, but undoubtedly it also will remind you of what that refrigerator must smell like. Nice pictures, nice layout, nice presentation, but pretty much useless if you want realistic ideas that you can use, let alone implement, in the corporate world (and BTW, the corporate world does extend to rockers like the Stones). If you really want to take a look at the book, go down to your nearest Big Box bricks-n-mortar storefront and thumb through it there."
4,In need of some inspiration?,"If you are, Curt Cloninger can help with Fresh Styles for Web Designers. I picked up this book hoping to get some ideas to snap me out of a bit of a rut. It worked. Not only did I find his descriptions of different styles, ideas and sites helpful, but the myriad of links in the book helped to fill my ""design ideas"" bookmarks folder with a ton of great sites.Web design clients want commercial sites that aren't often very artistic. Knowing that, Cloninger showed off underground web sites that exist for purely artistic reasons and used them to demonstrate that artistic endeavors are not just a path to web-based expression but a palette for ideas that will end up as part of tomorrow's commercial site developments.This revleation not only makes the book fun to read but practical as well. Nice job."
4,Just what I have been waiting for,This is a great book. I have been looking for a book to help get my creative juices flowing and when I saw this at the store I knew I had to have it. Very informative. I can't way to try and incorporate some of the techniques into my personal site.
5,Great Cookbook,"This cook book has how to make everything from cookies,cupcakes, bars, ways to spice up a box mix Wonderful cookbook with things you have on hand. And all with a box mix how great is that just love it gave it Have on gave as gift."
5,Butterfly is AWESOME!!!!!,"Everyone needs to buy this CD!! Butterfly is a phenomenal talent and needs to be heard. My stepdaughter turned us onto her awhile back, and we praise all this incredibly talented woman puts forth! What a treasure to us all! Mark my words, this young lady is headed for 'Super-Stardom'! Good Luck Butterfly, you're a 'one off' for sure and we love you!"
1,Grizzle Adams,"I was so excited to find that Amazon had the 2 seasons of Grizzle Adams, I wanted my grandkids to enjoy what I did as a child. Now Im not even going to waste my money because of all the negative feedback. Im glad I read before I purchased a 2 rate DVD. Amazon should not even let such low quality items on their site. Bad name!!!!"
2,ruin your hair,It straightens and breaks your hair! Hair gets caught in the seams and it pulls and breaks. Dont get shiny plastic.
2,Album Not As Good As Others,"WIll not say much other than if one really likes the quality and overall energy inducing mode of Vai's other works, this one might be a bit disappointing...that is, if that's what one is looking for. I've listened to it a few times..but nothing about it is particularly catchy right off the bat or even after a few tries. Will keep listening though, since it's in the rotating multi-CD changer ...from time to time. So far, I rated a miss."
4,Pretty good value,"This seems to be a high quality toaster oven, which it should be as it cost about twice the amount of your basic ""Black and Decker"" model. I like the way you can set the temp. and a timer will let you know when it has reached that temp - just like a real oven! Another reviewer said he didn't like the way it only browns on the top but I have heard that is intentional and preferable (though I can't remember the reasoning). The only gripe I have is that I have difficulty getting toast/poptarts out of it without hitting the top of the oven - ouch!"
5,rocks my world,"i am so in love with this toaster oven. works very well as a toaster, and as an oven, it's wonderful. preheats in a matter of minutes and i can bake and broil without heating up the whole kitchen, which is a major plus in the deep south. i love it i love it i love it."
3,Nice but run small,I normally wear a large sometimes a medium. I bought this in an XL thinking I'd be wearing it over heavy clothes and I wanted some roominess. It was so tight I couldn't even wear it if I had a light tshirt on. When I asked my husband what size it looked like he said small-medium. The quality seemed nice butbe prepared that the run small in size.
4,nice jacket,"Pretty nice jacket for an inexpensive price. Good color and material and design. I just don't like the fur that lines the inner hood. Also, I agree with the others... get a size bigger than what you usually would wear."
2,Avengers.....hard to recommend....,"I can't give this book lower than two stars because of the affordable price and historic significance of these issues. That being said, I can't honestly say I enjoyed much of anything about this collection. The characterization seems off on just about every hero through the entire book. I think Stan Lee was on auto pilot on this team book and more effort was going into the solo titles running at the same time. The best story is probably the last, a battle with Kang in the far future. I recommend this only for the Silver Age Marvel Comics completest."
3,"Half part useful, another half part not","This book is ok, the first half part is pretty good.It covers XML basic and DTD very well, but it does notcover schema; it covers XSLT/XSLFO also, although there are something inaccurate inside; its part for XLink and XPointer isuseless and wrong; and there is nothing for XML database orXSP. This book may be helpful, but you need another book as <<XML by example>> or <<Inside XML>> to really learn XML basic.Daniel, IBM certified developer for XML and related technologies."
3,Merely an introduction to XML...,"This book provides a useful overview into the basics of XML while doubling up as a quick reference to the XML specification. Handy for those that want to dabble in XML without buying a more detailed book, but then XML has so many related technologies anyone serious about XML will need more.The O'Reilly pocket references are so concise that they are not really meant for someone who is totally new to the subject. They can however be the ideal way to provide an overview to anyone who wants to know the basics of the topic."
4,"The best firewall book around, but lacking re: policy design","_Building Internet Firewalls_ is a great reference if you are looking for physical configuration recommendations (how to connect stuff) or protocol packet filtering characteristics (lots of great detail there), but it does not describe firewall policy design or management in any detail (and I'm not aware of a firewall book that does). This could use a few more ""real world"" examples of filter policies (not just physical architecture), perhaps even a chapter dedicated to each of a home network, a small-to-medium-size business (with perhaps a more complicated and rigorous policy), and a large enterprise (with multiple firewalls and a complex policy)."
5,The Chicago Boys Came Hard With Perfect Timing,This album is dope. I believe the chicago duo came with something to prove. I love the variety of music they offer. This is not just for the ladies or just for the thugs but for both. Babygirl is a 4sure hit and Chicago is the city anthem. The Intro is also very hot displaying a vivid introspective of the city of Chicago.
4,Great book!,"I borrowed this from the library and had to buy it. I am waiting on its arrival impatiently. The details are great, the instructions are clear and the pictures couldnt be better. The only real problem I have is the pattern placements could be better. From the fourth project on, many of the pattern pieces are located near the spine, not the outer edge of the page, so they are difficult to photo copy, and even tracing a few is challenging. But I still think this problem is small and the book is well worth the money."
5,Information is power!,"I bought your book How I Make $1000,000 a year in the music business from Amazon. Read it in two sittings and now I am so full of information in my head and in the form of pdf files that I don't know where to start. I signed on for your 10 day lessons and the killer promo packet. Information is power they say, and you certainly have opened up a floodgate for me. Thank you!"
4,This book tells it like it is.,"I finished this book in a couple of days in my spare time. It is straight forward and simple to read. There is really no complicated way in marketing. It tells you this and makes you rethink the way you market your band/music. There are ideas in the book that will make you rethink situations that we all have been in and how to make a positive out of a negative. This book is a good addition to any musician's collection. I will use it for future reference. I like the true stories and the comments of people in the business at the end of the book. Most of them are looking for true talent and originality, and this book helps you understand that and to keep working at your craft. With all the hard work it takes, you will know if you have what it takes."
1,Avoid this book,"This is the worst book Ive ever read about the music business. Unless you are a 12 year old preparing to start a garage band, do not buy this book. If you are a musician you already know 99.9 percent of what is in here. If you dont stop playing now. I highly reccommend buying ""How to be your own Booking agent..."" by Jeri Goldstein. I bought these two together and am very happy with the Goldstein book. The Hooper book is moronic and useless...I could not have disliked it more."
5,Some of the best tips you've never thought of...,"and some you have. If you're in a band or in the music business, or just knw someone who does, think about how important and how much business has to do with your art, and then think about what you know about handling business. Some of you know a lot, but most of us don't know [anything]... about negotiating deals, signing contracts, when your act is ready for a manager, etc...This is a great tool to help you learn all about what it takes go cut through the red=tape and do a lot of these things yourself.Check it out, you won't regret it."
5,one of the best music business books ever!,"I have read them all, folks. This is definitely one of the best. The greatest thing about it is that everything is put into an easy to understand, piece-by-piece formula. If you're not getting the gigs you want right now, you will be by the time you finish this book!"
5,an excellent introduction to music publishing and promotion,"I work in the music publishing business and often have artists/writers come to me wanting a publishing deal. Most have no idea what this means and are very intimidated by some of the ""standard"" books on the subject such as ""This Business of Music"" or ""Kohn on Music Licensing."" ""$100,000/year in the Music Business"" is the book I refer them to because of its clear and concise advice on music publishing and general music business practices. I have also given this book to a lot executives here in town because it has the same clear cut advice on music promotion, especially Internet promotion. This is a great book and has something for everybody."
4,Good Book,"This book is a great place to start learning about how the music business works. There's a lot here that only years of experience would teach you, and the earlier on that you learn this information, the better off you are. Some of the key aspects of this book is that the music business is just that: a business. When you start looking at things from the business person's perspective, you can begin to see what you can do differently to advance your own career. Buy this book!"
4,David Hooper's Book worth reading,"I think this is a very well organized book that can be understood by everyone and doesn't pander to the intellectually elite. For someone starting out it has invaluable information and for those who have been around a while, there is still enough to keep the pages turning. A good business primer.Music Manager"
2,He Made His Money Selling This Book,"If you are familiar with the basics of marketing, this book will seem like common sense.If you are bound and determined to avoid talking with anyone in the music industry, and this is going to be your only perspective on the music biz, you will realize you could have figured most of this out anyway.A positive note, the author summarizes points into inspirational-calendar-type statements. Good things to keep in mind."
4,"Great Info, Get this Book","I was not sure about this book at first. After reading through quickly, like I usually do, I found myself stopping and outlining things. Some things are simple but you never think about it. Some things you just have to be in the business to know. Overall this book is worth the investment. If you do half of what is in here you WILL make money with your music. No question about it."
5,"I'm, Like, SO Fat!","Excellent book. My daughter had to do a project for school on eating disorders in teens. Quite frankly, I think she was a little ""borderline eating disorder"" herself. She took the quiz and it really opened her eyes. The book was informative and well written."
2,limited use,"I have three or four vhs-c tapes that I want to convert to dvd. The item is very cheeply made and very flimsy to handle, but for the price I guess one can't expect much more. It cost more to ship it than the cost of the item itself. If you have a half dosen or so of vhs-c tapes you are looking to convert, I would say the item will last thru the process. But if you have several items to convert, do yourself a favor and invest in a better quality item that will stand up to the task. With this one you run the risk of it getting stuck into the tape recorder and then you'll have more problems then you bargened for."
1,VHS-C adapter will not work with most 8mm tapes.,The VHS-C is useless. The 8mm tape won't fit into it. There has never been an adapter made that would allow someome to play an 8mm tape in a VCR. The only way to play an 8mm tape is by using an 8mm camera. Don't waste your time and money on this product unless you have an 8mm-C camera.
1,I was disappointed,"I was disappointed as I had thought this would be very funny, but it wasn't very much so. I agree with the ho-hum comment as this was quotes I'd seen before and not very interesting as they were old. I had thought and hoped with a new election there weould be something new, but it was all the old Quayle and Reagan and Dole and such. And that is so lame and old!!! I expected new quotes from Gore and Goerge W. Bush. This seemed very dated already, unfortunately. But then, I guess it's because it takes along time to publish a book, right? Whatever, it is a shame, since this was a good idea. I just wish it had worked better, no offense."
2,Very poor sound quality. Not a bad price though!,"I just received this little toy the other day and I have to say that I am not too impressed with the sound. Its better than the radio, but its not as good as a cd (like the say). You cannot beat the price though... If you want a good MP3 player you will have to spend a little more... The bad thing about these players is that they dont have a FM tuner. This function can be very handy if you work out or run. Like they say it is the smallest MP3 player, so it doesnt slow you down like those large radios might."
3,Another DVD Reissue with Edited Episodes,"Great DVD set. Great image quality. Only complaint is the same complaint you see on more than half of the DVD 70's TV show reissues out there. Episodes have been cut down to size to make room for more commercials in syndication - and these edited episodes became the masters for the DVD sets. Bottom line: You're not getting the entire L&S; shows you remember.Remember the Shotz Brewery talent show where L&S; had to find a role for the boss's kid? One whole act (the lady who threw coins in the air and sang ""Pennies From Heaven"") has been cut out. The edit is so badly done that you wonder if the DVD glitched. The edit causes the whole scene to make no sense.It kills me not to give this set five stars. Great show, great memories. But the reviews are ideally about the DVD reissue and not the show. In that aspect, purists will be disappointed.Other than that, again, great set. It would get five stars if it weren't for the edits."
1,Secrets of Lock Picking,"Do not buy this book, for two reasons. 1- Every word of it is available on the Internet. It is little more than a pamphlet anyway so easy to download and print. 2- It is deceptive, in that the cover illustration is of a pick gun (the reason I bought the book) and there is only a single paragraph about pick guns with no instruction for use. The author even admits he has never used on. Why is it on the cover? The book is a fraud."
2,Meh,"This is a very thin book, both in page length and in content. There are newer and better materials out there that can be found on the Internet, and if your really set on buying a book, there are newer and better books. Not much information, not spelled out or explained clearly in many places, save your $."
2,Lock Picking,This book is okay. I felt that it is lacking a bit on the topic. It is a good introduction to the subject but still lacks something.
4,easy to use,This guide is simple to use with illustrations to help. My husband uses it daily to do his exercises.
2,Not very scary,"I had high hopes for this book, but the stories just aren't scary. I don't recommend this book, especially if you enjoy nail biting, edge of your seat ghost stories. This book is boring."
2,not practical,"i received this for a baby gift and returned it after finding out you couldnt wash the boppy itself, and you couldnt put another cover on it, because it had to attach to the other part with loops. i just bought a boppy and placed it on another play mat"
4,Gramin Nuvi 360,"Was new to the Chicago, Illinois area and needed to get around for interviews and everday errands. Researched various GPS' and decided on Garmin. Made a great choice! I love it! Had a little difficulty downloading the updated maps. I especially like the Bluetooth and car charging features. However, I don't care for the window suction cup. The cup fell off while I was driving. Bought a bean-bag dash board mount for $20. Works like a dream!"
5,Never Get Lost Again (almost),The Nuvi 360 is an awesome device. I was in Des Moines a few weeks ago and with one exception it worked flawlessly. (The road was too new I guess).Pros: It has many voice prompts and a very clear screen. Setup is easy but to add POIs you have to use their kludgy Garmin program.Cons: Can not for the life of me get it to connect to my bluetooth cell phone. It connects then disconnects. Not sure which device is to blame but the phone works with my headset and even my stereo in the car...Overall the is a top pick and I would buy it again in a heartbeat!!
2,Had to send it back,The map was just flat wrong!!! And it would repeat the same thing over and over. I would suggest for the money you get a cheaper one. I now have the Garmin 270 and it's working fabulous!
1,Poor satellite reception,The product is so bad and I am extremely disappointed....I went through many reviews and comparisons and bought this product.Satellite reception is the biggest problem and I experience the problem all the time. Some of my friends who bought the box at the same time also have similar issues.
4,Great Price and Excellent GPS,"This was my first portable GPS. The price was great for the features. The only issues I have found with this product is the satallite connection is slow at times in rural areas, and it is not compatiable with my cell phone. It would be nice to get directions to just a city without having to input an address.. it may be possible and I have not figured it out yet...lolAll in all.. I am pleased!!"
2,"yes it is great, but here is why it sucks","don't get me wrong, this is a great product. the following works well:- works out of the box- mp3 player- bluetooth phone sync is perfect, even got my addressbook (500+ names) out of the blackberry in a few secondshere is why it sucks:you have to search for things by category, say i'm at a lake and want to search for nearby marina, i type in marina, it doesn't find zilch. if i knew exactly what i wanted, why would i need a gps with points of interest?same goes for many other 'points of interests' as they are called, so all in all i ended up using google maps on my blackberry to find things, entering the exact address on the nuvi and then going there. this pretty much beats the point of having a gps for me."
2,not bad,i cant say good but its not bad.NAVIGON 7100 is easyer then Garmin nüvi 360.NAVIGON 7100 is simple then Garmin nüvi 360.NAVIGON 7100 look is also good then Garmin nüvi 360.The only thing is good in Garmin nüvi 360 is its MP3 player and Image viewer.But NAVIGON 7100 perfect for every one who is new with gps then Garmin nüvi 360.My 1st choice is NAVIGON 7100. This all are my personal review GARMIN dont fell bad.
2,Poor after sales service by Garmin,"The unit I purchased would lock up the screen. Garmin did not provide any solution. Thanks to Amazon, they were very professional and offered a replacement of the product. They were very prompt in shipping the replacement even before they received the defective unit back. Thanks to Amazon.com"
4,"Small, but packed with features.","I had to return this whole unit. It came without a mounting bracket, and they required the entire package to be returned. But I did get to examine and test this device, and it's really a nice GPS. It is loaded with features, not the least of which is a bluetooth phone connection. And the sound quality is very good. The only downside is that the screen is just a bit small for big fingers, like mine. Still, for the price (used), you get the features of a much more expensive GPS."
4,Well worth the money,"I can't believe I waited this long to get one. It makes traveling so much easier. The text to speach feaure is a great aid. While concentrating on the road, you do not have to constantly check the monitor because it speaks the street names and the distance to the pertinent street."
2,N/G can't show more then 35 resurants. Slow to P/U,I returned the GPS. It is nice and small and no problem with glare but it takes too long to get start everyday. Very easy to get started almost no set up involved. I wanted to put in an address in a city and have the GPS come up with resturants near by. It is limited to @ 35. Try that in NYC or other big cities. useless.
2,can't even locate my destination in Detroit!,"I just got it today, and i got sike out from reading all these great reviews. In about two week, i am am planning on going to detroit for somthing important, then.. i typed in the adress, over and over again, ( yes i spelt it right, in fact triple check"" All it came up was no match, no match... it is a big let-down. Plus, that manual, HA! that wasn't even a manual, 2 pages long, you call that a manual. it doens't explain anything.Even a CD player has 20 pages! Man i was fooled."
4,Overall a decent product,We are happy with the product so far. One small problem is that it takes a while to get signals.
3,Generally ok,Garmin nuvi 360 is generally ok. Except that it can sometimes take a longer route to reach a destination for no reason.The suction cup is defective. It can't stick to the windshield at all.
4,nice little gps,For the money a very good gps. I use it on my motorcycle (I know it is not intended for that kind of abuse) but for the money I thought I would gamble. Two years later it works great and keeps on going. My intention was to just buy another if this one couldn't take lengthy abuse - so far no need. It handles vibration well but I do put it away if it rains. My only gripe is that the sound is not loud enough to be heard on my bike. But - there is an outlet for ear buds if needing to hear the sound becomes important.As well I move it from vehicle to vehicle (car SUV Motorcycle) as the seasons change.If I lost it I would buy the same one right away!
2,High price of upgrades,"First, when I went to the Garmin website to check for upgrade, it said that I had to register to see if I was eligible for a free upgrade. So I registered and guess what, I wasn't eligible for any free upgrades. It seems to me, little more than a trick to get people to register.Second, the high price of upgrades. After paying $170, I now find out that I have to pay another $70 to upgrade the maps. They are charging me for the same information that Google gives away for free.If I had realized the high price to to keep the Garmin current, I would have done more research and possibly made a different purchase,"
5,Garmin Nuvi 360,"I think that the Garmin Nuvi 360 is one of the best GPS buys available since it incorporates bluetooth cellphone linkage so you can receive calls and talk hands free through the Nuvi 360. Although it doesn't give you the most efficient route just like all other GPS units, it does provide you reliable directions and also tons of information on gas stations, restaurants and other necessary options during travel."
4,Does what its supposed to do,"Does what it's supposed to do. text to voice works well, 'make right turn at south street' is much better than 'make right turn in 100 ft'."
5,Great Easy to Use GPS,"This is the first gps that i have ever owned. Very easy to use, awesome features such as finding restaurants or shopping locations near you. When it's fully charged, the battery lasts for a couple of hours so you don't have to plug it into the car charger. Used it for about a month now, and it's given me accurate directions every time. I love this gps unit! Only negative thing i could say is that the mp3 portion of it sucks, the speakers are way too small."
3,Garmin Nuvi 360,"The Nurvi 360 is very complete GPS and Travel Guide equipment, easy to operate through menus and touch screen system, LCD screen provides excellent visualization and finally has outstanding design, weight and size. Nevertheless I had bad experience since my Nurvi 360 is not reading the SD cards. I went to Garmi representative office in Brazil, where I live, and where I received excellency in attention and technical support. They checked my SD cards electronically in the computer check list and other compatible Nurvi 360 devices. SDs worked perfectly but actually my Nurvi 360 is not working for SD reading functions. I informed Amazon who promptly provided perfect support to replace the equipment. I continue to trust in Garmin brand and want to believe it happened as ""exception of exception"" or third digit defect rate from their total quality control."
4,Garmin nuvi 360 sets the standard,"The Garmin nuvi 360 is an excellent and easy gps navigation system to use.It is the standard by which other systems are rated. Ease of use is the key for someone like me, who refuses to read the manual. Sure it would be good to have a lot of state of the art features but not for the extra cost. This device does every thing you need and keeps it simple."
5,This thing is great,Thsi is one of those purchases you make that you wonder why you didnt have this several years before.We just moved to a new city and don't know our way around. This device has made our lives so much easier and has saved so much time. I am terrible with directions and often become a 'frustrated' driver when I lose my way. This thing has made driving so much more pleasurable and I have recommended this to many people now.The other nice thing about this device is its Bluetooth feature. It makes handsfree talking so simple. The sound and mic quality arent the best but its not that bad at all.Navagation: this thing is pretty much spot on! Thsi thing has nto led us off track once. This thing always has perfect directions. The spellign guide finds almost any place you are looking for in its directory.
1,Problems with the Garmin Nuvi 360 GPS with Bluetooth,"The GPS keeps taking me to the wrong route, despite being on the fastest time setting and even when there is barely any traffic on the freeway. Although this may be alright when you know the route but that really frustrates me.While traveling on a regular route, it directs me to take an exit which is actually the correct route but once I take that exit it starts recalculating for no apparent reason and directs me to another route then when I reset the GPS it re-directs me back to the route I was originally on taking me on and off the freeway when I can actually go straight to reach the destination.If you miss an exit, it recalculates and bring me back on the freeway and no detecting an alternative route to destination.I'm not sure if it is just the GPS I bought was defected or it happens to all of the GPS for 360."
4,Garmin 360 nuvi GPS unit,I purchase my Garmin 360 nuvi a few weeks ago and I took a trip to a small place in the mountains of Tennessee. I was surprised to witness all of the short cuts that I took and ended up at the address that I had selected. I have had the unit to come loose from the windshield a couple of times and luckly it did not break. I have since order a mount that sets on the dash. I have been very pleased with it's performance. I looked a some other units that were older models but feel that I made the best choice.
1,Outdated maps & poor Bluetooth,"Drove on some CA roads that I know have been around for over 3 years. But GPS showed me driving on ""dirt"".Main reason for picking this unit was for the Bluetooth. But was volume was very choppy.Returned it right away"
4,gps,"good gps. voice is loud enough if you dont play the radio too loud. the window mount dropped off twice before i decided not to use it. the outside temp was in the mid to high 90's, however, so i doubt anything would have remained fixed.i have managed to confuse it twice. both times when i neared an interstate/highway where more than 4 or 5 lanes began to slowly branch apart. it had a hard time indicating which of the 4 or 5 lanes i should be on. as i have never owned a different model this may be charecteristic of all gps'forego the mounting hardware and go to wal mart for some industrial velcro. mount the gps with this (on dash areas) and you have more options in more cars."
2,Fair,The touch screen does not work 100 percent of the time. I find it necessary to tap continusely till it takes my touch then it usually it the wrong letter or number i tried to select or want. I am not happy with its performance or conditio of unit. Will not buy from this vendor in the future.
4,Garmin Nuvi 360,"Excellent in every aspect. The only detail is that it takes from one to two seconds, depending the speed you are going, to correlate with the map on the device. Otherwise is excellent."
5,This is a great GPS,"This is the 2nd one of these I have purchased. Bought one for myself and loaned it to my parents who had to have one for themselves. This is easy to use, accurate and a great value."
3,Buen Producto,"Es muy buen producto, tiene bastante utilidades, se conecta perfectamente con el telefono por bluetooh, pero al momento de recalcular una nueva via se tarda mucho. Tambien la bateria le dura poco."
4,Badmaximo,"My first foray in the use of the GPS and it is doing a marvelous job. there are a few hiccups in using this product. one is the maps are not up to date. another is it shows my home 2 blocks away from where its located. (just a note Google maps do the same thing) one other thing is that it does not guide you using the most logical route. That being said I can say that it has got me to the proper location every time I've used it. I got it for work as a general contractor and Savannah has so many small named streets that I would spend too much time trying to find them, but the garmin gets me where I need to be with a minimum of fuss. I also love the blue tooth hands free phone. It is a great convenience. I have not used the MP3 function since my car has this function built in. All this being said I would recommend this unit for anyone needing a GPS. It has enough bells and whistles to make most anyone happy."
2,"Ok, but it seems to always choose the longest route","I bought this for my boyfriend's birthday, thinking it would be an awesome gift. The bluetooth feature is great. The directions though, seem to be not as accurate. We took it around on routes that we knew and it always takes us the longer and most complicated route, instead of the easy ways we know. We are still to view some of the features, but to be honest, I expected more. It is a good deal for the price, although my advice is do your homework and ask someone for advice before buying a GPS."
4,Great Product!!!,Very easy to use. You can purchase separate applications for international travel which is a bonus. Nice and compact. I'd recommend this to anyone.
5,Garmin is the future,"I am extremly happy with my Garmin. I would be lost without it, no pun intended."
4,Good but mine was defective,"I liked this model which is easy to fit in your shirt or trouser pocket, has variety of features and ofcourse helps you find your ways more accurately as compared to some other brands.Mine was a trouble piece whose battery drains out in ~45 mins even after being fully charged... sent it back of the replacement and bought 260w instead since i do not use bluetooth/mp3 (already integrated in my car) and new unit is more wider."
2,Didn't work well at all,"I don't know if I just got a faulty product, but it didn't work very well for me at all. It always would say ""acquiring satelites"" I did all the work arounds they reccomended and it kept doing it. It would work for a little while and then it would freeze and go to acquiring satelites, in the meantime I would have no idea where I was going. You can restart it and sometimes it will pick it up sometimes it won't. I was very disappointed, I sent it back. I may get the 350 everyone I know that has that one likes it."
4,NUVI360 review,"Great product, easy to use, intuitive and helpful right out of the box. most impressive was how easy it was to find the nearest gas station, or restaurant while traveling. The only thing I wasn't 100% happy with, was that the battery life could be better. The write ups said to expect about 8 hours, I got just better than half that. I've not yet used the bluetooth feature."
3,Long Time User,"I bought the NUVI 360 about 3 years ago, it's an ok unit. Occasionally it will direct you to go left over a median or can't find an address. I bought the updated maps, it took 5 attempts and 4 hours to download with a DSL connection. Customer support had me on hold for 2 hours, i emailed them, it took 5 days to answer the email. The email told me to call. Also customer support is closed on the weekend."
5,Simply the Best,"I have owned the Garmin Nuvi 360 for about one month now and I am still amazed at the performance of this little gem. I am impressed with the amount of information that can be packed in such a small package. It has worked flawlessly. The speed in which it acquires the satalite signal is impressive. The map which is included in the software is more than adequate, however the price of additional maps if needed for other countries is excessive."
2,Disappointed by small screen,"I like the Garmin nuvi series. I find myself driving quite a bit (I live in Pennsylvania) and the navigation system is effective. Maps appear to be up to date and directions are generally clear. When typing in locations, the nuvi has (so far) found the location almost every time.My complaint is the small screen. Based on the configuration of my car, the device is far away from where I sit and I find it hard to see the maps. In addition, the small touch screen is hard to use and requires decent manual dexterity.I recommend the nuvi technology, but advise others to spring for the extra money for a larger screen. Even an extra inch would make a significant difference in usability."
2,garmin360 review,I bought this garmin because it was bluetooth ready; the state I live in is going hands free in June. The problem is it is not compatible with my phone and will be of little use. As for guidance it is fairly accurate. I like the size and the ability to program. I did buy extra the non window holder for the GPS. The holder it comes with leaves a mark on the window giving theives the indication a GPS is in the car.
5,great......great......great,"I love this product. I love the blue tooth and the mp3 features. The fact that it's easy to use is the biggest bonus. Big enough screen,great locking system."
4,Excellent Product,I bought this 1 month before. So far it didn't give me any issues. It works excellent. Also its blue tooth and text to speech feature is very nice.
2,Single design flaw is a deal-breaker,"I've been using the nuvi360 for about 8 months now, and while it's been a lifesaver, it hasn't done anything that any other GPS could do. My biggest problem is that the screen is polarized 90 degrees off axis. If you're using polarized glasses the screen is black. I've driven about 3500 miles this summer and had to use the thing at a goofy 45 degree angle and tip my head just so I could see the screen. The only reason I didn't return it is because it was a gift.This is a major engineering blunder in the screen fabrication. There are tons of alternatives out there. Get one of those instead."
2,Black Magic Tire Wet,"The Black Magic tire wet does not produce the claimed ""wet look"" as it says on the bottle. It does make the tires look nice but nothing like the bottle says or a wet glare."
4,Great stuff,"worth the money, does what it says it is going to do, it makes your tires almost the same as the stuff that they paint on ur tires at the car wash, but since that comes in barrels and is only for carwashes, this is the next best thing"
2,Same ol' same ol',"This cd is so boring...my gawd. I am so disappointed, Tweet what happened? A word of advice loose Missy because all of the songs sound the damn same, and if its not that Missy yelling over the track...she needs to work with more people, the writing is great but the music is the same ol' thing..and the arrangement of the songs are all the same. Try agin."
4,uncomparable to southern hummingbird,"her first lp is a more darker, depressed tweet, this one she is done, and moving on and happy again.best songs""iceberg""""you""""small change"""
5,Wonderful hotels for a great travel experience,"We are the authors of Eating & Drinking in Italy and have used this guide for many years. If you want to have a memorable trip to Italy, stay in the small hotels listed in this helpful guide."
5,Finally an honest & effective way to deal with weight loss!,"I'll echo the comments of others here to say that this book gave me enormous relief and encouragement by dealing squarely with the truths about body, attitude and the effort required to lose weight and maintain that loss.Especially helpful is the information in Chapter 7 about Reattribution Technique (do you properly ascribe causes to things internal/external? do you help or hurt yourself deciding things are global/unchanging?) and Rational Emotive Technique.I would like to buy a copy for every friend and family member I've ever seen struggle to make sense out of all the gobbledee-gook out there in diet books and magazines."
4,Interesting to read...,"This book is very easy to read thru, has humor and I am glad I bought it.However being a newbie in the mac world{very experienced in all flavors of windows} this book has many wasted pages on .."".this is how we did this in OS9."". if that would have been ..how we did this in windows.. then I could have used that info. So this is not THE book for a PC convert but a good read."
2,"Missing manual, missing chapter",Examine your copy of this book carefully. So far I have found at least one missing chapter.Otherwise the content has been very helpful and I would buy it again especially if I could have the missing chapter.
2,Pogue's in vogue but aint informed,"I bought this book to help me switch from Winduhs. It's a lotta words and I later read in his New York Times column that he ""types"" by dictation into .. I think Dragon Naturally Speaking on a Winduhs based machine (uh hu). The book's contents could have been cut down to less than a hundred pages-- but these books are sold by the kilo anyway. He didn't really know the OS he just banged out a quick book to earn a yep a quick buck. I read his ""consumer"" columns in the NYtimes and find them useful but this book wasn't. Oh yeah and the switch ...... to Mac .... over rated but OK."
3,Restrained,"Somber, quiet, plain, sad. Characters are very restrained. Would like to have been able to know them better. Maxwell's writing is lovely"
4,Good value,"The Mundial 5100 is an amazing value. For the price of utter mediocrity that you'd get at a big box store, you get a pretty nicely, constructed piece of cutlery. You just have to be sure that you like the bulk of German style knives. This one is fairly heavy, and at 6 inches it's not a lot of cutting surface for the amount of weight you're carrying. Still, it's a good everyday knife. The scalloped cutaways don't actually work because the blade is too thick."
5,great little do-it-all.,"My wife and I were introduced to the joys of toaster oven reheating a few years ago. We've just recently moved, and I learned about this unit on Amazon.com. I bought it because of the savings, and the lure of convection baking. I must say that we are not disappointed. We have a large family and this unit does it all and SOOOOO much better than a nukerowave. My only complaint (a small one) is that we can't quite fit a pizza inside this unit without folding up the edges. Otherwise it is wonderfull, just a marvelous machine. I now find myself salivating over other Cuisinart products."
1,TOB-175 BC Max baking temp?,Looking to know how high the oven can get in degrees - I cannot find this info at the mfgs website or in any product reviews.a) Temperature control/setting is in degrees?b) Maximum temperature available i.e.: 350 degrees etc.?c) Does it show in display actual temperature inside oven?Thanks
4,excellent product,"I've had the machine for a little over 3 months, and have put it to considerable use. Cooks very well and useful for various types of cooking. One complaint - the drip pan has rusted - the chrome is not of good quality. Haven't decided whether to try to order a new one or take the existing one and have it plated better, or perhaps even porcelainized. Would definitely recommend this product for it's quality of cooking."
5,Yes!!,"Finally a toaster oven that is really quick and easy. Delonghi, good-bye and good riddance (after owning two and both only lasting one year). This was pricey, but electronic is the only way to go. Toast doesn't brown exactly even on both sides, but 90% is good enough."
1,burnt,"I read the reviews and thought this sounded like a good toaster oven - not so! Not only does the thing get scorching hot with every use, it says to bake things with the rack on the lower level. The rolls were all burnt on the bottom. So then I tried baking biscuits with the tray at the toaster level - top burnt, bottom raw. It does toast okay, but if all you're interested in is toasting things, just buy a toasster."
1,Beware: Cuisinart Customer Service is HORRIBLE,"Beware. Just hope it never breaks down. When I had a problem with another Cuisinart product, all I could ever reach at the customer ""service"" department were order takers for new gizmos for the food processors. Whenever I tried to voice my complaint, they hung up on me, presumably so they could take more orders.And I tried every number I could find in my product manuals, on the Web site, etc. I could never get through, or they hung up on me the moment they realized I wasn't ordering something.And by the way, ""Cuisinart"" ceased to exist many years ago. It's now owned by Conair, the maker of crappy hair dryers."
4,Great Toaster Oven,"Have had this for about 9 months now. It works great, has several options to cook just the way you want.Holds 4 slices of bread no problem, its not wide enough to do 6 without some overlap.My only complaint is that if I set the timer when baking something, the temp does not turn off when the timer ends. So if you dont hear the timer and turn it off then it will continue to cook. I suppose my full size kitchen oven does the same thing...so not a big deal, just cant set it and forget it."
3,Great oven....but enamel came off the top of the unit,"I received this toaster oven for Xmas a couple of years back (I picked it out!) I am very pleased with the functionality of the oven and use it daily. However, I have the white model and since I use the toaster function a lot, I keep the broiling pan on top of the oven. From early on the paint on the top of the unit has chipped off (could be from the heat and keeping the broiler pan on top?? ) Whatever the case, the paint looks old and horrible and much older than it actually is. I would expect that an appliance that cost this much would last more than a couple of years. I am in the market for another & while the functionality is bar none.... I would definitely not buy the white model again -- maybe the stainless."
2,Read this before you buy,"The oven is well made but their are a few thing it does not do for the price.1. The top of this oven gets extremely hot. Not just hot to the touch. People used to a microwave will be very suprised by this.A little insulation would have gone a long way here. This is a serious safety consideration.2. This item keeps cooking after the beeps. Auto shutoff occurs after 4 hours. Microwave users beware. If you dont respond to the beeps your food is ""TOAST"". This could be a fire hazzard unless you are real carefull.3. Their is no light inside to help determine when your food is done.4. The LCD display is not backlit. Not good for the baby boomer generation.In summery: This item is designed to overcook the food you can`t see and burn you at the same time."
5,Just right for us,"My wife originally bought the model 30 from Cuisinart, but the reviews here were horrible, so we decided on this more expensive unit. We wanted a toaster oven to help keep the heat down in the kitchen during the summer. The package warns that the exterior gets hot, but it does not seem excessive, and much less heating than from a full-sized oven.I had no idea what a great invention the convection oven is: I have made cookies and hot wings with equal success. The oven seems to cook a little faster in the convection mode, so the cookies were done about 15% faster than the package suggested. I'm still experimenting with toast.It is a little large, but smaller than some of the less expensive Cuisinart units. I'll try and up-date this review after we've had it a while."
5,Convection toaster oven,"I bought this little beauty a few weeks ago and have now had the opportunity to use all of its features: broiling, convection baking and convential baking (of course, just plain toasting too). It does an oustanding job on convection baking (chicken, game hens, small leg of lamb, etc.) and broiling (salmon steaks, chicken breasts, etc.). This is now my very favorite small appliance and I absolutely love it! Dinner guests are very impressed too:-) It is small enough so it doesn't take up too much counter space and is very attractive and streamlined looking and easy to clean. You cannot go wrong with this little beauty and its versatility, and it's perfect for a one or two person household."
5,Read the manual - you'll love this product,"Rated high and did not disappoint. Highly recommend reading the manual to set tray different uses. Bagels, english muffins and toast have all come out perfectly. Baked brownies on convection - aok. That's it so far."
4,Great oven,"This oven works great! Toast is fine. I use it in place of my full size oven all the time now. I've made bread, cookies, biscuits... All cooked perfectly. I love the digital controls.My only complaint is that the lowest position for the rack does not have a clip to keep the rack from falling out (the top position does). It makes it a bit tricky to check on something since when you pull out the lower rack it droops down a bit and wants to slide/fall out. I bought a Wilton Cake Lifter to remove whatever I'm baking from the oven (it works great for pizza too)."
2,Not perfect - bad warranty,"I've owned this item for about 8 months. It toasts and bakes adequately. About a month ago I noticed a hairline crack on the control panel. I hadn't dropped it nor had I dropped anything on it. I called Cuisinart customer service and they verified that it was still under warranty. They told me I could ship the oven to them at my expense and they would determine whether the item warranted a repair or replacement--or nothing at all! I would also be responsible for the cost of return shipping.I determined that it wasn't worth the hassel and expense. I also determined that, if this was the kind of warranty Cuisinart provided for their shoddy products, I will not buy anything else made by them again."
4,"An excellent product, with a few minor flaws...","This is the nicest toaster oven I've even used. It has the most even heat and reproducible results. As an oven, it's better than most full-size ovens, provided what you want to cook will fit. Since this is a fairly large toaster oven, it can fit most small meals. The convection function is very handy if you're in a hurry or want extra crispness. Convection will shave 20-50% off your cooking time, depending on the thickness of your food.The good: Even heat. Temperature sensor gives accurate toasting time after time. Convection feature. Looks slick.The bad: Loud beep when done. Door does not pull bottom rack out. Interior light would have been nice. Expensive."
2,Poor Toasting,"Despite the reviews I read about this product and being a proud owner of an older Cuisinart Convection Oven, I order this product with high expections. To our dismay, the first oven we received did not produce equally browed toast - the top side always seemed to be darker than the botton regardless of how the tray was situated. We decided to return the oven and the replacement produced the same results - unequal browning when toasting. My conversations with Cuisinart were not helpful and the representative I spoke with instructed me to return the oven again for a replacement, however Amazon has since informed me that they will not allow another replacement since there may be a wider spread issue. So, it looks like I will be returning this oven for a refund and looking for a replacement from another manufacturer. While others mention issues with toasting, I wish my experience was as positive as the other reviews I read and with my previous Cuisinart Toaster oven."
5,Cuisinart Convection Toaster Oven,"I had a previous Ceusinart Convection and loved it to the point that I told my husband one morning that I would have to have next day air on one if something happened to it. I seldom use my big oven. I especially love the size - actually takes a regular round size cake pan. Low and behold, it went out the day of my comment to my husband. I immediately ordered another. I have also given one to my daughter and daughter-in-law. Both love theirs."
5,Excellent product!,"I love this toaster! Although it has been very complicated to figure out - lots of options, rack settings, convection bake vs regular bake, etc., the quality of the food it produces has been outstanding. Toast is evenly browned, baked and broiled foods are evenly cooked and moist. It has been well worth the effort to figure out how to use it. I would like more information in the product guide about when to use convection baking vs regular baking but that's my only suggestion."
4,Black Magic Tire Wet,The product goes on very well and does a good job of putting on a rich looking shine. The only thing is you have to lightly wipe it to avoid it from spotting on the tire.
4,Great book,This is a very interesting book; highly recommended if you live in the Pacific Northwest. The major drawback in my opinion is a lack of color photos.
3,Natural Born Intuition,Interesting but needed more for me. Alot of exercises for the thinking.Still working on them.
5,It's not only for designers...,"This book actually appeals to many different audiences. It will help the designer understand the left-brain information that a web programmer uses when wading through a thicket of acronyms. Programmers who read this book will understand why the designer tells them that a font or color has to be ""just so."" Information about project management helps both the designer and programmer understand what the managers are going through to get them all to work together to bring a project in on time and under budget.The writing flows nicely; the book is enjoyable to read. The humor and conversational style support the material quite well."
1,Of Men and Music,"This purchase was a total bummer. I bought it as a present for my husband, received the ""product"" only to find out that although the DVD was labelled with the title I wanted, it turned out to be an early silent movie of very bad quality ...I wrote, and was told that another DVD would be sent at no charge and that I didn't have to return the one I received. Great ! A few weeks later DVD #2 arrives -- Unfortunately, I received another DVD with the ""correct"" label entitled ""Of Men and Music"" only to find out that it ALSO contained the wrong film, the same silent movie that I did not want.No luck with this one..."
5,Great book for all readers,This book from National Geographic gives a lot of information about the fifty states in the United States of America. Highly recommend.
1,Easy reading but not worth it,"I bought this book hoping to learn some technical issues involved in web business, after reading it I found I learned nothing new. It seemed to touch every issues related but really explained nothing. There are certainly better books than this one."
5,"Nice, and does it all.",This convection/oven combination is a nice size to stay on your counter. I just received it for Christmas and used it one time to bake some rolls. No problems for a first time use. Has a lot of combinations of buttons which takes a bit of time to learn. It does seem to get a bit hot so have it placed on a plastic cutting board sized to fit.
5,Great Looking Oven,"I have looked at this oven several times and it appears to be the best oven of this type on the market, and I am purchasing my oven on line as I can save several DOLLORS, I will do that today and let you know how it works, I am fussy about what I buy, and I love my other cusinurt products. Marie Roberson Kerrville Texas"
3,Great when new but not built to last,"Cuisinart toaster ovens consistently get rave reviews, because they are well designed and work great WHEN YOU FIRST GET THEM. The sad fact is that they are not built to last. After 2 years the paint around the door of our TOB-165 was burnt, bubbled, and cracked. Now at 3 years the plastic control membrane surface is starting to split. None of this would happen if Cuisinart had used temperature resistant materials. Maybe I am unrealistic to expect any small appliance to last more than 3 years. This oven needs to be replaced but I don't know if it is even possible to buy quality any more."
5,Over the top.,"After replacing the last cheap toaster oven with this Cuisinart TOB-165, I cannot say enough good things about my new oven! Although it has more options than I can keep up with, it's an outstanding unit that will do anything that you could want a small oven to do, and do it well. From toast that is just right on both sides to salmon that is cooked perfectly."
4,Just right with an added light,"Our beloved DeLonghi toaster oven cratered after 18 years of heavy use, so we replaced it with this attractive Cuisinart unit. The Cuisinart doesn't heat up as fast, but otherwise it is much more versatile. We particularly like the many different tray heights available (at least eight, counting all the permutations of tray height and broiler pan position).The one shortcoming of the Cuisinart and almost all other new toasters is, as others have pointed out, the lack of an interior light. We solved this problem neatly by attaching a clip-on booklight to the front door handle. Not only is the light thus out of the line of fire, so to speak, but one can focus it on the part of the food due to brown first, and, of course, turn the light off when it isn't needed."
1,You've got to be kidding,"For well over $..., you would expect perfection, get ready for disappointment. The good: great oven, good tempertature control, looks. The Bad: it takes up a lot of space, zero insulation so plastic will melt if left on top, complicated setting system, THE WORST TOASTER ON THE MARKET. You are better off buying a $.. proctor silex for toast. Read consumers report, they criticize it too. If it were $.. I'd be happy but at this price I feel ripped off"
5,Fantastic toasting and baking results,"I purchased this toaster oven because the full size oven where I live is 25-50 degrees too hot or cold, can't even cook a pizza in it. So, after researching 3 to 4 other brands & models decided on the Cuisinart TOB-165.Since I have owned it, I use my full-size oven as a cookware storage closet. The Cuisinart toasts everything perfectly and very evenly. I have made casseroles, biscuits, broiled meats and it is fantastic. The digital buttons are easy to use and the temperature is very consistent, no burnt sides or cold interiors. With the convection controls, it definitely cooks much quicker than a standard oven and wastes much less electricity and heat. Pre-heating time for 375-425 degrees is about 5-7 minutes.I'd definitely buy this again as a gift or for someone moving out on their own."
5,VERY USEFUL,"This is one item in your kitchen that WON'T go unused......We use it every day, for toasting, broiling and baking, all with very good results,easy to clean, which must be done frequently to avoid grease buildup.Today, I seared a 2 inch steak in my cast iron skillet and finished it in the convection oven done perfectly"
2,Not a practical pan for daily cooking.,"The one Sunday morning I used this pan, it turned very ugly i.e. the copper all but disappeared and odd splotch marks appeared on the bottom. Only after much elbow grease and polish did the pan look nearly new again. The pan comes with a warning not to use over high heat. I would venture to say it likes low heat exclusively. I would not use this pan for meat or onions."
2,Bad Quality,"I bought this in hope that the CD will have the quality that is worth the name of O'Reilly. But I was wrong. The search engine is very poor. Even though it says to search the whole body, give it an 'is', you get no result. Also the master index has a lot of flaws in it. I cannot use the section ""Symbol"" and ""C"". All the links miss the book name. All in all, this definitely is a big dissappointment to me."
5,By far the best on WW II timeline/history,Martin Gilbert's writings are excellent. I am now officially his fan. This book by far is the best and the most complete work on WW II I have ever come across. I have read works of A.J.P Taylor and other historians on WW II but I got to admit that this is the best so far. It's easy to read and understand. Martin Gilbert is an able historian who knows how to tell the story in a simple and understandable fashion. Great book!
3,The Book of Numbers,"I started this book with hopes of seeing an over all picture of WWII from begining to end. What I got was hundreds of pages of 'this many dead from this campaign,' or 'these many dead from that concentration camp.' At first, I was digusted at the Nazi's murdering of Jews and POWs, but after a while, the numbers lost all meaning on me. What I wanted was a book that explained the war in better detail. Throwing tons of satistics at me is not in depth writing in my opinion. I didn't want: 'between September 1st and 13th, 13,000 Poles had died in combat.' I wanted a book that explained how the battles unfolded that resulted in those losses. The book does have its moments form time to time (which barely kept my interest in it as a whole), but more often than not, I found that I was forcing myself to read just so I could get that 'big picture' of the war this book never provides."
1,Ponderous,I have been a fan of Diana's since day one and this release is such a disappointment. She has gone a new direction and it does not work. The songs seem to have no melody and just seem ponderous. I have tried to embrace it....it just does not work.
1,Don't buy this CD!,"I would like to tell you about Diana's music, but I can't play the CD on my computer unless I go to her website and register for her fan club--that's wrong! Why should I have to give out my personal information (email address, etc.) to listen to a CD that I purchased? If I give out my info, at least give me the CD for free! This is ridiculous. My advice: don't buy the CD."
1,The Girl in the next room needs Help,"It's just amazing to me how the jazz industry is so out of it that it promotes a flat and lifeless singer like Ms. Krall but disregards really great talent like Dena DeRose and Carmen Lundy, unknown and underrated, unappreciated unhyped,! If you are really interested in great jazz singing check out the amazing ""Something To Believe In"" by Carmen Lundy, and ""Love's Holiday"" by Dena DeRose These will both spin you around and show you what great singing is about. In concert Dena DeRose totally knocked me out. Her playing is as serious as it gets, and she sings beautifully. On occasion she gets into scatting unison lines with her right hand, or she'll sing different melodic textures against her chordal voicings. Very hip stuff."
1,Avoid this disc- will not play in many players,"Don't buy this. While you might be thinking ""Hey- this is neat! I get a DVD and CD on one disc!"", the reality is that you're really just getting a DVD. The CD side isn't really a CD and is unplayable on many CD players (like the one in your car or some disc changers) and on computers. The CD insert says: ""The audio side of this disc does not conform to CD specifications and therefore not all DVD and CD players will play the audio side of this disc"". Save a few dollars and buy the real CD version and avoid these unusable fake CDs."
3,No so much jazz,"Krall has always seemed to me at her best when whooping through a snappy standard. I was pleasantly surprised however, and more than a little emotional when I listened my way through very eagerly - several times in a row. The material is mature, beautiful, bold, fresh but not light or pop-like. Blues, gospel, country, jazz interpretation, and even a little rock n roll blend to create serious tunes."
3,Diana's Hard Edge,"Diana fans used to smooth her jazz stylings will not find it here. Her marriage to, and writing collaboration with, Elvis Costello has resulted in twelve songs more on the hard edge of the Krall jazz style; more like something one might expect from Norah Jones. Joni Mitchell's ""Black Crow"" is well interpreted but lacks the Mitchell intensity. The album is well done and the production values are superb. (What did everyone do before ProTools?) It might be better if Miss Krall leaves Mr. Costello at home when she records her next album."
3,I was disappointed,"I love Diana Krall and couldn't wait to pick up her latest work. I was disappointed, however. Let's face it - she sure can play the piano, but I prefer her sultry voice on her previous CD's. Still nice music to listen to, but not my favorite."
3,The Girl in the Other Room,I am very sorry that this CD is not as good as the other ones she has done. She is lacking inspiration. Maybe too many CDs and too little material. Beautiful voice as she always has but the selection for this cd is very poor. LOVE HER ANYWAY.But I regret getting this CD.
1,Sorry bit of music...,"If you could call this music. The lyrics, the music every thing about this Cd is bad. I think Diana's heart was not at all with this project, its just plain flat and hard on the ears. With Diana's previous efforts of her craft they were enjoyable because of her style of music. I hope she goes back to what works because this isn't the Diana Krall I like. This Cd was hard to listen to and I would not come back to this Cd again."
3,Is that all there is?,The thing that struck me about this album was that it lacks personality. Nothing grabs you. The backup is spartan and there is nothing compelling about any of the pieces. Maybe all the really fabulous material was used in her previous albums. I just feel this is a ho hum offering.
2,"Well done, but not what I like","I thoroughly have enjoyed Diana Krall's music, and expected to on this album, too. While her voice is terrific, the material isn't for me. It would be like a dead head getting an album of Barry Manilow covers by Jerry Garcia. Live and learn..."
3,Will the REAL Diana Krall please stand up!,"I was anxiously awaiting the release of her next CD. Diana's last few albums have really taken her in a new direction musically. It took me a month to have 'The Look of Love' grow on me. I have listened to this new CD twice and feel like I have to force myself to put it in the player if I ever hope to have it grow on me as well. I was instantly in love with 'Love Scenes', 'When I Look in Your Eyes' and 'All For You'. Not one of them is ever an arm's length away from my CD player. Diana, get your groove on girl, but don't forget your roots.... Come home soon -- I shall remain a dedicated, and anxiously awaiting fan!!"
2,"Lyrics Are Better, But Music Still Lacks Depth & Emotion","Again, Krall has put together a compilation of songs about love and life, but again does not include the most important factor in music: emotion. Her voice is much the same as someone speaking the poems with an orchestra in the background. I know she must have the ability to express emotion with her voice (and it would sound great if she did), but I've yet to hear it. I have listened to this CD along with ""The Look of Love"" and it all is basically coffee shop background music- nothing more. I'm not impressed by this artist in the slightest and am starting to wish that Limewire was legal so I can avoid wasting my money in the future."
2,Pianist or Vocalist?,"Not one of my favorite Krall recordings. Her singing voice may be an acquired taste. In my opinion she's a far better pianist than vocalist. Better that she stick to piano with the occasional vocal thrown in. Barbara Carroll, who's singing voice is also an acquired taste (which I have to say I acquired years ago) has it about right. Diana Krall should steer away from this stype of recording. I've played my copy of this CD only once and that's more than enough for me. To each his own."
3,Not much to get excited about,"I'm a big fan of Diana Krall and was very surprised at the quality of her voice on this cd. Sorry, but I like jazz that makes me wanna stomp my feet and snap my fingers and make me get up and dance, not put me to sleep. The lyrics are so drawn out and her voice sounds strained. I wish she would do a tribute to Frank Sinatra,the capitol years. I would love to hear her rendition of Witchcraft."
3,"Not swinging standards, but interesting nonetheless","Let me preface my comment by saying I've been a fan of Diana Krall since ""All For You,"" and I despised the appeal to popularism that was ""When I Look in Your Eyes."" Oh, those schlocky 1001 strings!!! And don't even ask me about ""The Look of Love."" With that in mind, it is not surprising that for a new Diana Krall album I would *love* to hear a return to her jazz-trio roots.Regarding this new album, the other commentators are correct when they say it is not a return to the swinging standards I enjoy so much. And for that I am disappointed. However, I must admit I find this new album much more musically honest, deep, complex and challenging than ""When I Look in Your Eyes"" and ""The Look of Love."" It's not what I was hoping for, but it's interesting nonetheless."
3,Some great songs and some duds...,"This album is recorded well and my only complaint about the musicians is that Marc Ribot should've been the guitarist. He was born to play these type of tunes.The lyrics on this album are very good and even a little raunchy at times... Especially ""Love me like a man."" Most Krall fans will adore the album - if you're not into Krall - this album won't sell you either. Ta-ta..."
3,Sometimes useful companion,"I really didn't like this book in the beginning. Why? Most of the time I'm using an on-line documentation for quick reference and original Oracle documentation set for studying material larger than a few pages. In the old days (do you remember Oracle Book ? ;-) this kind of reference guide would be a rescue for any DBA. Now days?Perhaps... The organization of the book is quite good, index is excellent and some chapters are more than just reference on the subject. When I'm not working on the site where I can easily reach on-line documentation or paper manuals then this book goes with me. One drawback at the time of writing this review is that this edition doesn't cover Oracle8i so you should at least wait for the second edition."
2,Nothing Special,"This book is oriented towards Oracle 8. I found at times that certain parameters were missing or at times they were not indicated as to whether they were V7 or V8 only. This book lacks depth to be of any practical use, other than a quick reference. Overall, skip buying this title."
1,If you love westerns...DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!,"I love westerns! Tombstone, Unforgiven, Long Riders, Young Guns, etc. , This movie is is not like any of them. I took a chance on it at Best Buy after reading the back cover and WASTED $20. The movie and the back cover are two DIFFERENT movies!!! This movie would actually be a ZERO if it wasn't for Michael Madsen."
4,A western like no other,"This is no ordinary western, and I was very intrigued. There's a bad guy, a girl and a hero to cheer for, but the film has a mythical quality that tags it a 'western like no other'. I can forgive them letting Lewis butcher one of my favorite songs (Oh Danny Boy), though the Irish everywhere were pulling out their hair, this was still well done. Someone got creative and used a great supernatural twist. The special effects adds a chilling flare to a 'Peyote' vision where the fight with the bad guy ends. Outstanding!Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
4,Very Unique Western in the tradition of Jodorowsky,"This is one of the best westerns in a looooooong time. The film has very trippy visuals in it because the main character uses a native american hallucinogen throughout the film which reminds me somewhat of Alejandro Jodorowsky's El Topo. If you are a fan of his or westerns, or if you are not the film is still a great film to check out."
5,Amazing,"I have searched for this book since leaving Ireland and had have spent many hours at borders and the like with not a hint of it .Im not going to go on and on about this book , but for anyone thats feeling like they have been lacking something in their life and on a constant search for the ache they have that cant be explained .BUY THIS BOOK."
3,CD not DVD,I am not happy.When I ordered this item I was under the impression that it was the DVD version rather than the CD version.When I opened it-suprise-CD and not DVDI can't find anything in the documentation that is available that specifies media-so I think I am stuck.I will in the future be more careful
3,"Good Selection, With Issues...","On the positive side, this book provides a good list of hymns for guitar application. The majority of the songs are familiar to any congregation that still is hymn-based rather than praise chorus oriented. Some of the hymns, however, are almost unusable for the musicians due to the format---one song in particular that we were considering stretched over five pages. The Hymn Book, published by Elderly Instruments is vastly superior when it comes to being user friendly, although its selection isn't as large as The Big Book. Overall, I would recommend the book. Most guitar oriented books for worship have a ton of praise choruses with a few token hymns. The Big Book gives you a lot of selections and options that most of the others don't"
3,No Liquids,I wish I had listened to the review on this product about liquids. I used it once and it's going back. You can't put no more than 3 cups of liquid it. For that kind of money you should be able to put 7 cups of soup in it without it going all over the floor. If a blender can be made not to leak why can't a food processor?
4,Great movie and wonderful cinematics,This was a good movie even though everyone probably knows the climax of the movie. It was extremely well acted and the cinematic adventure was great. There was a few unneeded lines but otherwise a feel good and happy movie to watch. Enjoy!
3,Secretariat,"SecretariatFor the horse racing fan, especially those who enjoy the Kentucky Derby, this bio-pic of a great horse is very entertaining. The family issues while very real are dramatically slow. In all, this film is appropriate for the whole family to watch together. It entertains, teaches historical fact and offers family value discussions, while giving the racing fan some great race scenes and the history of a great horse."
4,Secretariat - loved it,"Wonderful movie. Good for the whole family. Can't wait to watch it with my grandchildren, even my grandmother friends will enjoy it. Thanks to Ammazon, I purchase so many good movies without leaving the house especially during the winter months and they arrive in a few days. Thank you Amazon. Audrey Parey"
1,Not a good DVD,I had to return this DVD to the sender because it would not play in my player. Kept receiving Region Error which may have been due to the fact the DVD was from the UK. Took a long time for DVD to come in the mail.
2,BOOOOOOOORING,Great if you are on a transatlantic flight & can't sleep on planes. Typical Disney mushy film. Only good scenes were the race scenes with the low camera angles. No real story. Save your time for Seabiscut.
2,Secretariat deserves better than this movie,"Secretariat was a wonder of nature. Watching him run gave me goose bumps.Why did it take so long for someone to make a move about this magnificent horse? Considering the quality of this movie, they should have waited longer. This movie was not about the horse but his owner. Secretariat was, and is, exciting enough for the entire plot. Why dilute the plot with the owner's ""story""?It was poorly edited. The plot was sort of slowly moving along and suddenly Secretariat was being called the wonder horse. There was certainly nothing in the movie that justified that title at this point in the movie.Even the cinematography was poor to average.I agree with most of the oomments made by the 1-star and 2-star reviewers. And did trainers and grooms of high priced thououghbreds really use hay nets?I was disappointed. Secretariat deserves better."
3,Out in front by 10 lengths!,"Good horse tale. It's based on a true story, and unlike in most Disney films, the mom doesn't die.The acting was really good--especially John Malkovich. I usually don't like him as an actor because the characters he plays are nearly always irritating. So is this character: he's a curmudgeon, but with a soft center.The story was well-written and the dramatic tension held my interest without stressing me out. The sets were great.And did I mention the horse? Whoever played Secretariat was a good looking pony.I gave this three stars only because, as a family film that doesn't aspire to anything greater than being a fun movie, it doesn't move into the ""classic animal film"" realm ( Old Yeller, Lassie Come Home, etc.) Can I say that it was a five star for a three-star category film?It's a good family movie night choice for all ages, and you will probably cry before the end. Just a warning."
4,movie,It's a movie and it moves as it should. Received at decent price. Seven more words required one two three
5,Secretariat,My husband loved this movie and he is not one to go to movies. He just suffers through one occasionally for me. He ended out enjoying this one however and so did I!
1,Boring and Insipid,"I watched this movie for an hour waiting for the drama and excitement of a good horse race. I saw one race, in brief snippets only, with no sense of the overall drama of the race. After an hour of a stupid meandering plot with everyCliche known to hollywood, we turned it off. What a dumb movie"
2,terrible,"So boring. It was really a huge disappointment I had bought this used for a present and watched it first, now i'm not even sure I can gift this without being embarrassed at how bad it is... I recommend any other horse movie ever made over this one."
2,Please watch Seabiscuit instead...,"I had heard good things about this flick when it came out in theatres, but was disappointed when I finally got around to renting it.The film was not dynamic with few (but predictable) plot twists, the acting was mediocre, and the story was generally uninteresting. I actually enjoy when films like this are Hollywoodized, with a little extra drama added to the story, making it more interesting (and historically incorrect, I know, but much more interesting to watch... I don't go to the movies for a history lesson). I was disappointed that there was no real ""drama"" - horse racing is always a gamble, and Penny Chenery was no exception; she just happened to get lucky this time.And the movie is nearly 2 hours long - much longer than it needed to be.If you need an inspiring horse racing flick, Seabiscuit is much better (check out Rotten Tomatoes)."
5,Absolutely wonderful movie,Secretariat could be the greatest athlete of all time and he was certainly the greatest race horse that ever lived. This movie is thrilling and insightful with great performances and mind-boggling races. Order it right now.
4,Very good family movie we all enjoyed very much.,"This was a very good movie, no foul language to worry about as there was in Sea Biscut. All of us enjoyed it from seven years old to fifty-seven."
4,Not for Everyone,"I loved this DVD. However, must say if you don't like horse stories or don't remember Secretariat and the story of his owner it might not be for you. Truly an amazing animal. I've watched it 3 times so far and keep replaying the Belmont race; never been another race like it."
3,The People Around the Horse,"While this movie is named ""Secretariat"", it really does not have that much to do with the actual horse Secretariat but mostly about the people around him. As a native Virginian who watched this horse's career with avid interest, I found mistakes and controversies that should have been brought out, i.e., the fact that the Preakness record was actually bested by Secretariat (all those stop watches could not have been wrong) but the stewards' faulty clock was accepted as the official time. Only the Triple Crown was presented and not the remainder of his racing career. All in all, however, it was an ""all right"" movie."
3,Beautiful but rushed,"I found this recording of Mendelssohn's Piano Concertos to be very good! I play piano myself and have learned both the concertos. This is the best recording I have heard of the concertos. However, the piano solo works are not to be praised. The Variations serieuses sounds way to machanical for my taste. Thibaudet needs to loosen up a bit and start to feel the music. Also the Rondo Cappriccioso (one of my all time favorite piano solos) sounds terrible! For one thing way to many liberties are taken with the andante and second of all the presto movement is to rushed. I had to play it a second time to make sure it was the same piece! I'm sorry but music like Mendelssohn's needs to be played with expression and the two solo works on this track deffinetly lack that!"
1,Yawn,The best thing about this video concert the mediocre band. That isn't saying much. How Prince can be so highly rated is beyond me. His music is about as bland and boring as anything I've heard. Watching it is even worse. Saying he is over-rated doesn't quite say it.
2,"Prince I love you, but I HATE this dvd!!","I have been a fan of Prince since 1978, when ""I Wanna Be Your Lover"" was released. I use to kiss the album cover every night before bed. I purchased this dvd, expecting more from your concerts, (since I was never able to go to one of the concerts in person), I wanted to see you in one of favorite cities in the United States. I am so glad I didn't go to this concert because I would be very disappointed. I did love all your original songs you performed in this concert, but I didn't like the other songs that was performed. It seems that Prince was sort of disinterested in his performance, and I became disinterested in watching it. I give this dvd a phffft. :P. Sorry love, maybe I will buy the ""One Night A Lone"" box set and hopefully enjoy that better."
4,Supa Funky Jazz Night with Prince,"Man oh Man...if you have any questions or doubts about who rules the funk world you can put them to rest after watching this DVD.Prince does a great job as band leader, singer, and guitar player. The NPG is totally kicking like a superpower kung fu chicken!If you want Prince from the 1984 days of Purple Rain, you better get something else...If you want Prince as he is today, the Reining Funk Master, get this DVD.Half the set is modern jazz and the other half is rocking like nobody's business.If you play guitar there is an extra bonus on with the extra track. This is the first time I have ever heard or seen Prince play guitar like greats Jeff Beck and Carlos Santana."
3,left hanging,"I was at this show, and not only did Prince leave more than half of the show on the cuttting room floor, but no DTS sound. The picture is somewhat shotty in parrts, but the audio is what hurts the most. I wiil say that the highlight for me is the version of ""Gotta Broken Heart Again"". All in all the best part of the night was the solo piano set which only the last song ""Sometimes It Snows In April"" is represented. Just let us see all 3 hours of the show!!!!! A must for die hard Prince fans."
3,Prince in a cloak,"I eagerly awaited getting this dvd. Prince with a great band, great songs, and Live !!.Popped the disc in, rolled through the credits and then into the concert footage....check my sounds system..?? this doesn't sound right..??I check the audio options, well it's only 2CH but hey it should sound better than this..???, sure it's not 5.1 or DTS, not sure why it's not?Anyway I must admit I was really put off with the very poor audio on this disc that I couldn't enjoy it, I knew what it should have sounded like.I'm not sure what went on with the engineering of the audio, but I was suprised as Prince's CD's and DVD's usually sound fantastic."
5,Rave un2 the DVD fantastic,"I just finished watching this and I'm at a loss for words. It is absolutely outstanding in every respect - the set list, the musicians, the sound quality, you name it. The only way it could be better is if it was twice as long and had Rhonda Smith's home phone number."
5,KISS lives Forever,"I can't help but feel I've seen something close to this very similar in the WONDER WOMAN TV SERIES. No Gene or the boys of course but the episode made me relate to this film. Actually they should have enlisted Lynda Carter for this movie since she was doing her series around this same time-it could have been cool wonder woman and KISS together to fight evil. well,as the song say's I was made for lovin' you-and I do guys KISS has been such a positive force in my life as well."
2,"Should have known, a bootleg.","Well I received my copy of this bootleg and I can't believe Amazon allowed this. The DVD cover is phony, the disk is store bought. The audio is awful and the video is just ok.I should have known. Hopefully this will eventually be remastered even though the movie is not that great. But it is KISS!Not happy guys."
2,NOT for beginners,"I spent 2 months on day 1. If the author had simply added, ""If you can't install IIS, you can use Personal Web Server, which comes free from Microsoft,"" it would have saved me a lot of time. I gave up on the book."
2,Only if you don't want to learn the VS.NET interface,"I was excited to get this book, since the Wrox books have been going down hill. I was disappointed to see that it teaches you all of the syntax in notepad, which is partly my fault, since I didn't have time to look far enough into the book to see that. I was expecting a book to show me how to develop ASP.NET pages in the Visual Studio .NET environment. Sure, you can code ASP.NET in notepad, but if you have a tool that does the repitious code for you, why use notepad? I work in a place where you have to work efficiently, and notepad is the worst way to create ASP.NET pages. I am hoping to take this back and get my money back, but I don't expect it. Anybody want my copy? I have no use for it."
1,Codes don't work????,I am perplexed at the users that rated this publication highly and I would be very interested in speaking with them to find out how they got the codes to work. About 80% of the codes that I type from this book result in me reiceiving errors in my application - even if I type it exactly the way the book does! I do not understand why Sams publishing would allow this book to be published and I would STRONGLY reccomend that browsers interested in this book do not purchase it. Especially if you are new to programming because it is extremely confusing for new users. I have a background in programming and I find it confusing at times. However the book's biggest disadvantage is that is the coding errors! I even downloaded the codes directly from the publisher and they still throw errors. So I know its not my mistake in typing them out because the downloaded ones from the publisher do not work either!
5,Great For Beginners!,"This is probably the best beginners book out there. This book intruduces the new technology as if the reader knew nothing but simple HTML. Don't get me wrong, the book covers all the new and advance features of ASP .NET, but the writer address the reader as if the reader new little about web development. If you've been VERY active in the ASP.NET development for the past few months, I suggest you read Wrox's Professional ASP.NET. If you have been one with very little time to involve yourself with the .NET code, i suggest you get this book now."
3,"Excelent for new comers, Ok for developers","When i was looking for a book about ASP.NET, i was searching for a book that could give me an idea what .NET was about, then i found this book which i thought that would be easy to follow for me, that i've got experience with web development but not too much ASP lines written.Once i get the book, i was really excited about it, it's really easy to follow and ASP.NET is an excelent technology... but now that i'm on chapter 6 i think that it's not enough for me... it do not covers some ideas as much as i would like...Neither, there is nothing about Visual Studio.net, maybe some chapter giving some tips could be great."
5,Brickman is hard to beat...,I can listen to Jim Brickman's music all day long and not grow tired of it. This album is no exception...relax & enjoy!
1,not happy,"this rug was not what I wanted it looks completely differant from the picture and its only 26"" inches round. defiantly too much money for what I got in the mail. not a happy camper, no more on line ordering."
2,hair dryer-curler combo,not like my old one...does not seem to be as well built....curls hair different too
4,"Use for body and style, not drying","i am still getting the hang of this curler...never been handy with them. always seem to come out looking like Farrah's gawky little sister or something lolbut i like this a lot. i have fine medium length hair and (as my sister instructed me to do for best results) i dry my hair with a blow dryer, and use this to curl and give body. The waves i get last all day and it doesnt tangle my hair as long as im careful, and also use the release."
2,Disappointed,"I had purchased a hot air brush that was similar in a department store several years ago. I used it until it finally wore out. When I saw this one, I was ecstatic. However, the product is somewhat inferior. The air blower shuts off if you use it for too long, and the bristles snarl my hair. I don't think I would buy this product again."
3,Everything but power!,"Beautifully designed, easy to handle BUT power is severely lacking. Would take an hour to actually dry even slightly damp short hair with this device."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money !!!!!,This was a waste of money. I returned it in less than an hour. The recording quality (there was none) was awful. I could barely understand what I said. I bought the RP 5022A by RCA instead and it is like comparing a Rolls Royce to a VW Beetle !!!! This recorder is way overpriced here and not a good buy at all. Keep your money!! Get the RP502A and you wont be sorry!!!
2,flowbeee,"It's ok but, never cuts that good . Have to keep going over the hair over and over. would of bought another type if I'd known it was like that."
1,Deserves less than a star,"If you've been to his website, you will see just how truly un-knowledgable the author is.. He's funny, articulate, and rock stupid as far as target audiences and economics. This book, and the corresponding website (which may I add crashes the latest version of IE) is not even slightly useful to the serious web enterpenuer."
2,"Yawn -- Been There, Done That","Built on a clever premise, but poorly executed, this book is a let down. If it is your first book on Web design you might enjoy it, but if you are already beyond the novice stage you won't learn too much. The presentation is light-hearted, but there is a lot of fluff and nothing you haven't already heard before. Despite the other ho-hum reader reviews I bought this book. Don't make the same mistake I did. It's not worth the price."
5,Funny and helpful,"I think this book concept is an outstanding one. I read this many years ago and I still recommend it to those that tell me they want to learn about web design. Years later, I still visit their web site and subscribe to the RSS feed. It is an exceptional book that all designers should read."
3,Good overall summary. Not detail enough for real world use.,The books covers almost every single topic you can imagine in enterprise server side Java technology. But covering all the topics at a level detail enough for real implementation in 1500 pages is simply not possible.
1,A Lot of Weight... Low Value,Pretty disapointed. The book is large in weight but low in value. It stayed at a pretty high level. At times lost focus and found several content errors.
5,Well Done,"I have been working with Flash MX, ColdFusion MX and Dreamweaver MX since they were in beta and therefore had dabbled in dynamic rich applications that were driven by remoting, but I wasn't a key developer in those applications, nor was I a beta tester for Remoting etc... So when this book arrived I was eager to see what it had to offer.Being an author and contributer myself, I'm usually very critical of how information is presented. I always think... ""This could be said so much better."" etc... But that was not the case with this book. Robert and Simon have done an excellent job in presenting concepts that come across in a simple, clear and thorough manner.What can I say? It's a good book."
4,Not Just for the Infertile,"""Infertility Sucks"" is a must read for the infertile, their families, friends and anyone who wants to gain insight into their world. Barna opens the arms of sisterhood to the similarly situated and provides a glimpse into their world for the rest of us. The book is a compelling read about a difficult experience thanks in large part to the writer's use of humor, imagination and wry wordplay."
4,great,"great book with excellent black and white photography. As an architecture student, I found this book to be a great gift and resource. Packaging could have been better, but the book was still in very good condition."
3,So - so,"This book is a good introduction to the field, but I think the notation can be quite cumbersome at times. I've seen the concepts presented elsewhere in less confusing form, but it's a good general source as it includes a considerable amount of information from relatively current research. The examples are typically very easy to understand, though they aren't always complicated enough to make the notation easy to understand."
3,A Good Throw-Away,"My husband has an ES8095 which he loves. However, the new cutters and screen cost close to $50 and they last less than a year. He decided to give this Panasonic a try since it's a lot less expensive. It does a decent job and the charge lasts for 4 shaves - his beard isn't that heavy, but does need daily grooming. When it doesn't shave well, we'll toss it and buy another."
3,"Good battery, Works Well Overall...","I bought this for my husband about six months ago, and he has been pleased. It was his first electric shaver, so it took about a week or so to get used to it. He also had better luck when he used it daily, rather than alternating between it and a blade.Pros= long-lasting battery, close shaveCons= has trouble with some facial contours, esp. neck"
2,A Howling Disappointment,"I was looking for a good, inexpensive back up electric razor to replace an aged Norelco. Well, this unit was inexpensive, but alas, you do get what you pay for. In this case, not a very good shave. I don't have a thick beard, I don't have a problem beard. I don't even need to shave everyday to look presentable. But when I do shave, I expect more than 50% of my neck hairs to get clipped. This razor can't do that. I was more uncomfortable after shaving with it, than before I shaved. I have used both rotary and conventional blade electrics in the past, and this unit was the worst. Also, it didn't matter whether I shaved wet or dry. Still no good. After trying for a week, I sent it back to Amazon."
5,Great solution,Family member studying accounting and using a laptop with no number pad. The works great! Breathing price fast shipping. Makes doing accounting work eazy.
3,?,"iT ARRIVED TOO LATE FOR US TO USE AT OUR ANNUAL SALE, SO IT WAS NOT NEEDED AS WE HAD TO MAKE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS."
1,Not Mac user friendly,"Even though the package says Mac 10.1 + compatible, it is not. I even emailed Targus and they said it was definitely not Mac compatible. Don't waste your money."
4,A good product - but not perfect,"I use a laptop and sometimes need to enter a large amount of numbers intovarious applications, so I really missed having a keypad on my keyboard.The Targus Ultra Mini USB keyboard really goes a long way to replacing thenormal keyboard keypad. The extra USB port is a nice extra as well. Theonly complaint I have is that the keypad lies flat without a built in wayto tilt it to a more comfortable angle."
1,Not the same as the picture: PAUK10U,"BE CAREFUL when you buy. The product I received at home is NOT THE SAME AS ADVERTISED in the picture, it's advertised the PAUK10U but what I received was the PAUK10C. If you search for the product id PAUK10U at google you will see that there are at least three models: all black, all gray, gray with black numbers. The one that is gray with black numbers is the one that I received at home (PAUK10C) and is DIFFERENT from the picture product here at amazon (PAUK10U), that shows the gray only (and a all black with calculator which is not in discussion here). It has NO USB input as the others have, I have the one that is gray only and it is better built quality and has 2 useful usb inputs wich I plug my mouse and printer. This is the first time I have a problem with an item that I purchased here at amazon and I've been buying products here every month for almost 5 years."
5,Great & Works with Windows 7 x64,"I was afraid to buy this keypad just in case it had compatibility issues with Windows 7 64bit (The packaging says it's compatible up to Vista). It works great, and the extra USB port powered my Microsoft Mouse with no issues at all. Great product!"
5,GREATEST THING EVER!,"Ok this is the coolest song i would buy it again and again if i had to. I just love all their songs and how they really dont care what people think and put out their message in a great way. My favorite song is ""Herp"" Red pill mix! BUY THIS CD ITS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!"
2,This is only one side,"Per the Skyjacker website, this is only one leaf spring (add them to your cart to find out). That said, you will need two of these if you are looking to replace both the left and right side. Oh and one other FYI, those nice looking coil shocks are not included."
2,My kids dont like these...,"Ages 3 and 6. They like the regular gummy vites, so I decided to try these and they do not like them. They have a granular sugar coating on them and they dont taste very good. My 6 Y/O used to beg for extras of the regular ones but gives me a hard time taking these. Gonna stick with the original gummy vites."
1,Useless...don't waste your money,"I wear glasses and press against the viewfinder as hard as I can to help keep the shot stable (I shoot birds at 700mm). The first thing my friend and I did was to compare two identical lenses/cameras etc. - one with, one without, the extender.Result: - the image appeared the same size, and the extender slightly blurred the image. In other words - completely useless."
2,Don't FIT,"I both this for my Canon T1i, it said it fits all EOS cameras, but a small list of them,the part is about a 1/8"" to 3/16"" to wide to slide down on the eye pice, I like to find one with a longer extender on it."
3,Did not read carefully,"I thought I was buying this because I lost my eye cup. I was dissapointed to find that it was only an extender not a larger eyecup replacement. I like how it brings the eye piece out, it is more comfortable to shoot with, however I feel like I am going to loose the whole unit when I am walking arond with my d60 hanging over my shoulder form the neck strap.bottom line it does what it says, but it stays in my bag most of the time."
3,The quality as the price is,"It seem not properly fit with my 40d, I mean not tight enough to be attached securely at the camera body, but if you didn't push hard on this piece, it will be ok and not slip off from the place."
1,This cr*p doesn't work,This eyepiece doesn't work on all EOS Cameras. I purchased this for my EOS Rebel XS and it doesn't fit due to the camera's body shape. Will NOT RECOMMEND TO BUY unless the back of your EOS has a completely flat space around the eyepiece.
4,Works well on MOST Eos Cameras,"This does help. Esp those of us with glasses and a large face.However it does NOT fit all EOS bodies. It does not work on the 1D and 1Ds Series. I found this out the hard way when I took the one form my 5D I had sold and tried to put it on my Mark 3. No luck! Luckily with live view, its not too big of an issue now. I have one on my back up body, the 40D and also on my IR converted camera."
1,TOTALLY USELESS,THIS PIECE OF PLASTIC REDUCES YOUR FIELD OF VIEW SO YOU SEE SUCH AS A SMALL IMAGE THAT IT IS CONTERPRODUCTIVE. A SCAM TO GET YOUR MONEY. AVOID!!!
3,Not ALL EOS Cameras,"The Canon EP-EX15 does NOT fit ""all EOS Cameras"" as I found out it doesn't fit my Canon 1D Mark III."
1,Beware! Open up at once,"I ordered this for Halloween and received it in a timely matter.It took a couple of weeks to watch when I did it had a Bella Lugosi collection. The case was correct but the DVD was wrong. Returned to Amazon quick and easy for a replacement thinking it was one time mistake at the factory. But when I received the second one, WRONG, it had the same Bella collection in it. Return to Amazon for refund.On a side note, the Bella colection was pretty good, quality on a couple movies were fair, but since they are 60+ years old I won't complain.The collection wasHorror Classics V.1"
1,So So,"It does pull the battery cover off sometimes. It did hold the phone well.My problem is that I dropped the phone with the holster attached, and the holster busted. I have dropped other phones in the holster and no real damage to either. But this is a cheaper plastic. I would not recommend this. The big problem is finding a good belt clip holster the the phone faces forward. I dont like the backward ones."
3,Not a big fan of diapers,"Though this is convenient, it somehow did not feel good for my daughter. We preferred cloth diapers eventually at home. This is only for outside trips. My daughter was potty trained by the time she was 3 years old. It is highly recommended to make them potty trained early and use as less of diaper as possible. It is convenient and OK, so giving 3 stars. Prolonged use will give diaper rashes."
2,"Dull, even for PETUNIA","Boy, has metal gone downhill in the mainstream. Of course it's better than their first album, but what isn't. Petunia has always had its rabid fans and always will, but as a non-fan I can't recommend this dvd to other non-fans."
2,May as well buy the Videos,"Yes the content Pantera is of course great - but this seems to have been a profit making DVD. Heavy Metal without ANY subwoofer output!! My 15"" seperate sub is doing nothing because they didn't put the track in. No real DVD features, quality not really much better than video's.If you have the video's give this one a miss - otherwise don't buy it if you want to listen to music, buy the CD's instead."
4,Nice at That!,"Here is an nice effort by a new vocal and horn blower. He plays a nice trombone. However, his vocals, to my hearing, are a bit off key. Now then, perhaps it's my speakers on this computer. Or simply my hearing. The vocals are not always correct . . . being a bit on the flat side. It seems as though, Todd sings a bit flat at times. Then, on the other hand, he can dial in to the key, beat and tune and then does a nice job. Perhaps something has to do wtih the control people. But, I like his efforts at his first musical album. I think Tod Londagin would be a great neighbor."
3,Clip light OK,"This clip light is satisfactory, but not great. It clips on my headboard and serves as a small light source in the early evening and as a light to use during the night when I do not want to turn bright room light on, but need just a little bit of light, The twist on switch is hard to turn. The low wattage bulb is just right."
1,Not much info,"This book failed to explain both Functional and Technical design concepts of Oracle Applications' , rather tried to explain the set up options like an implementation manual.as per my opinion ,If you are looking for a conceptual knowledge about the various modules then this is not the right one.It neither explains waht are the jey tables and how they interact nor explains a process flow.Nothing mentioned about the technical details .More over it discusses lot of superflusious thngs like consultants life style and what to look in a good consultant and all that ..For me its money and time waste and a big dis appointment ."
2,Disappointing,"I must admit that I was disappointed in this film. It had the feeling of a ""movie of the week"" and there was little unpredictable. I have never read the story it was based on, but am a fan of Bradbury. The author had a series on television many years ago that had none of the production value of this movie. I suggest you rent it before you buy."
1,Waste of time and money,OK this is a book that really doesn't do much for me. It is simply a rehash of stories that have been told a million and one times. There isn't just anything new in this story. I would like to know what secret files the title is referencing. This book is so weak that I can tell you what will be in the World's Most Haunted Places 2 because they are holding back certain famous places from the list.This is just a cheap and bad book not worth your time. Spend your money elsewhere.
2,...put me to sleep...,Boaring... Are there no scary ghost books out there!?!?!?This is like a yellow pages of some random and possibly haunted sites. Very tedious reading and not at all entertaining.
5,Enjoyed it!,I thoroughly enjoyed this collection of chilling stories. I highly recommend it to those who love ghost stories. I only hope the author puts another volumn out.
4,Pretty satisfying book!,"Good book. A side from the fact that the hero and heroin take forever to get together I was pretty impressed. This was my first time reading this author. I have read very few futuristic novels, but I felt this book had great detail. I would recommend this book to anyone who reads these types of novels. To help gauge my review, my favorite futuristics so far have been by Johana Lindsey."
1,"Poor romance, poor science fiction--no starts at all","I was looking forward to one of my favorite fusions, but this isn't it. Very disappointing. I would suggest Dara Joy books and Johanna Lindsey's Keeper of the Heart duo instead."
5,Fantastic,"I had really done my research on razor bump solutions and I compared so many other products to this one. I'm glad that I went by the reviews here.It provided instant relief after shaving any area of the body. Any razor bumps soon calmed down and began to disappear. I am most impressed though with the lack of ingrown hairs since using bump down.Not the most pleasant smelling thing, but smells much nicer than most do and its somewhat faint.Buy it, try it out and watch the razor bump problem slip away"
4,This product definitely works!!,Honestly i cant believe it that a product exists out there to relieve razor bumps and this is it!! I started using this product 2 months ago and by now i have noticed a great improvement not that big but the razor bumps on my legs have def. become less visible. This is the best online product i have ever used and i am so happy i came across this product.. For the women out there who have those embarrassing unsightly razor bumps Get Barc Bump Down! Caution: It wont work rite away so dont expect to see results in a week or two give this product time use it on a daily basis twice a day and consistently until the appearance of the razor bumps lessen. Overall I am a very satisfied customer. Only down side is I wish it came in a bigger size but the money is def. worth it and this product is not a scam! It definitely says wat it does and works!
2,"Not the worst thing I've wasted my time reading, but...","Sorry... this collection struck me as a prime example of artsy-froo-froo, white people pretending they know about ""indian stuff"". While I appreciate that Coyote has been an inspiration to to the folks who put this together, saying I liked it would sort of be like me telling my cat he's a ""good boy"" when he drops a dead roach in my lap as a ""present"".I'd have loved to be able to say something nice about this. I guess it would be a worthwhile thing to have on your shelf, to compare to legitimate books, or to illustrate that there are many interpretations of Coyote's nature. I wouldn't pay top dollar for it.And this interpretation is as legitimate as any, I suppose- I just didn't like it. The book seemed ""full of itself."" Considering the subject matter, I suppose there's some irony there.I don't know why people would ever think Coyote tricks them. They usually trick themselves.-- Coyote"
5,No Fluff,"If you're tired of how-to books that utilize examples full of fluff and stuff that you can't really use for anything, you'll find this book a welcome relief.My goal was to understand the new Action Script in Flash 5, but not merely in an academic way, I wanted something that uses ""real-world"" examples. Flash 5 Magic is doing just that. I say doing because there is so much meat in this thing that it'll take a while before I'll completely digest it all.I say hats-off to the Flash 5 Magic team, they've created a real winner and one that you other how-to book authors should model your next book after. At least you won't have frustrated guys like me sending you email and calling you wondering when you are going to get out of academia and into the real world."
5,"Good Stuff, Give me More","I can't wait for the next book, I want more. I purchased after seeing some of the great reviews. Frankly I suspect a couple may be from competing authors.The code works fine, in fact the samples in the book are all contained on the CD-ROM and guess what, it works. Hmm makes you wonder about the validity of ""some"" comments doesn't it.The layout of the book is very easy to follow and understand. What I really liked is the usefullness of the projects."
3,Scratching the surface,"After reading Flash 4 Magic last year, I came to the conclusion that that book left me with more questions than answers due to the lack of detail an OOP book should contain. Leafing through Flash 5 Magic this year I had high hopes that this book would be more comprehensive than it's predecessor. Upon finishing this book, I am still left with the same feeling that I was with Flash 4 Magic. When a book attempts to describe a conceptually oriented program like Flash 5 and fails to deliver specific steps needed to instruct the reader, the book fails in its purpose. Flash 5 Magic visually entices the buyer without delivering the entire actionscript code and specific steps needed to complete the book's example projects."
2,this book is not helping me at all,This is a book too complicate for the Flash5 beginers and to easy for the experts.It will make the beginners feel more confusion on the Action Script. And I don't think the Action Sript Masters need to read this.
3,Flash 5 Magic: With ActionScript,This book is a good continuation to the previous book - Flash 4 Magic. However some of the tutorial are a bit more difficult to follow and a bit confusing. Some of the explanation were not easy to understand.
5,Another winner from O'Reilly!,"This book is with out a doubt the best reference book out there on the market today on VBScript. I am currently learning server-side programming in school and this is the book they are using to teach us ASP programming. That, in itself, says A LOT! Not only is it a great reference book but it is also being used as a teaching tool! I am also in the process of creating a website purely in ASP and between this book and the ASP in a Nutshell book I am well on my way to creating a great personal website! Definitely Worth a Buy!"
5,Therapy of bipolar disorder,"The book presents an excellent review of the subject. It is geared for the practitioners, primarily non-MDs. Manualized approach is helpful."
4,Bi Polar Bear,"This little book explains very well some of the problems in a bipolar family. My 12 year granddaughter informed me that she already ""knew that stuff"" and hates to talk about it, but I'm glad I purchased it anyway. I do recommend the book especially for children who have someone in the family with BPD who can read to them and answer questions."
3,Power Tools or useful nuggets?,"This is a useful book and contains a huge number of insightful nuggets of information presented in the format of short articles. I found references to things I had never even dreamed of existing in Unix. However, I find that the ""nugget"" approach is not as useful as a coordinated text would have been, because some things are covered several times, while other things are only mentioned in passing. This book would probably be most useful to a system administrator or user as an adjunct to another reference text. The typesetting could also have been improved, as there are some references in a very pale grey font which I find unnecessarily hard to read, expecially in dim light."
4,Unix and Linux users need this book,"This is easily the largest O'Reilly book I have seen, but it's worth it. It's chock full of 45 chapters devoted to nearly all topics in the Unix world. It's helpful for a wide range of skill levels. My only problem with it is that it's a bit out of date (1997), but as Unix draws on a 30 year tradition, most of the tips and tricks work as advertised on the latest Linux distros."
5,The only one book needed nearby your UNIX box!,"Complete, neat, easy and extremely useful!most people hate arcane unix commands, but in this book you'll be in love with these magic commands and learn to use them powerfully and creatively.echo ""Happy commadlining!"""
5,It's the buy or die bible of UNIX.,"This is without a shadow of a doubt the single most important volume for UNIX administrators and powerusers.The book is loaded with hints, tips, truicks and explanations bound to make your everyday UNIX life a lot easier!It's the buy or die bible of UNIX."
5,KC Reaction Watch,"Watch is amazing, the face looks awesome, A great watch for casual and formal occasions."
3,Great For New Comers!,"True, this book does not convey everything about Ifa and the Orisas. But considering the status of most people in the religion (and religion period)it does a great job. In other words, it stops where others (pref. babalawos and priestesses) should be able to begin. It has a very western, logical approach to understanding Ifa and the Orisa, which may not be good for some people. But, what's important is that someone gets a stepping stone to start from. Considering the fact, that most people are not in Nigeria, Cuba, N.Y. or Fla. to learn truly what the religion is about. So, where do you begin? Here, this book is one good example before proceeding to GO."
4,Rediscover Yourself,A must for Black race because God never stopped creation with a race. I will recommend this book for any one who intends to discover himself/herself in work of God.
2,"""The Sting"" this book ain't","I picked up a copy of this book for $2 on a discount rack and I wasted my money. Character development was virtually non-existant with a storyline almost impossible to believe. Everyone jumping into bed with everyone else and everyone scamming from each other...including the cops scamming from each other. And practically no ending at all. After reading KING CON by Stephen J. Cannell, I was hoping for something similar but no such luck."
5,clarinet,"I got this for my 2 yr old grandson and he absolutely loves it, best Christmas present. He really enjoys playing with this and pretending like he is marching in a band."
3,An OK item.,"This cable is NOT UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) cable. It is not CAT5 or even CAT3 which requires twisted pairs to prevent crosstalk and shield from external noise. However, since the cable is flat, all lines are parallel to each other and there is much less crosstalk compare to round cables.So it will work better than untwisted round cable, but still not as good as UTP cable. I found there is quiet some delay during auto negotiation because of bad signal. But still works quiet well upto 100Mbps. Gigabit will fail and falls down to 100Mbps.For those who needs real UTP, there are flat UTP cables (more expensive). Get flat UTP."
1,aww shucks,"the inside piece, where the cd sits, is made out of the same cheap clear plastic as the rest of the case. it is hard to remove (to put cd back cover in) without breaking it. it also make the entire cd case weaker"
3,"Totem....Good Acting, Bad Story","I thought the acting was good in this movie, especially that of Jason Faunt and Marissa Tait. But the story itself was a lousy one...perhaps the killings, etc. would have worked had the pacing been better. But at times it was too rushed, or too slow, so it didn't really work out well.If you like one of the actors, get it...it's always fun to look at them in different roles (try checking out Jason Faunt as a Power Ranger and compare him to this). But if you're looking for a good horror movie...don't get it."
1,why has'nt it been lowered price wise,totem was released in oct of 99 it was after 6 months to be lowered in price! why is it still 89.99? And ifs it just a bad movie 65 min again why so high?
1,"""Oh, Damn my eyes....""","...for watching this total garbage! I love Full Moon movies, but this wasn't good at all. Beyond chessy special effect, you could see all the wires and such that operated the Totems....Horrible acting by a bunch of no name actors, all of which this is the only thing they have ever been in.....Except jason faunt, he was beheaded in the beginning of Witchouse.....That is a good movie, check that one out. This was a very short, like 65 mins movie, no basis or plot development behind it...Full moon really has something with puppets...i mean really, just stay with the puppet master movies! Watch this if you are a full moon fan, but don't except anything!"
1,Awful is more like it,This is one of those cheesy DEADALIVE productions that look like they were made by your brother and his friends after he got his first cam corder. Basically standard issue and as predictable as an iceburg with the Tittanic. A group find themselves victimized by Totem pole that comes alive. Which is more than you can say for the movie. You find yourself wishing that you could have been first to die so you don't have to stay for the whole film.
2,Drink First...it's better,"Before watching this movie sit down with a case of beer. very important. if you do not do this you will not enjoy the movie. the druker you get, the better this movie will be. if you do not drink before watching this movie, you will want to drink ten minutes into it so i suggest you get about a 6 beer head start. you can substitute the beer for liquer. i give this movie three stars when you watch it while drinking tequila."
3,NOT THE BEST BUT STILL A MUST,"Good one to put into Sinatra TV Shows Series in your collection but I guess it is not the best. If you are going to buy only one Sinatra TV Special, try another one. Otherwise, if you are a Sinatra fan like me, don't miss it.. Especially ""That's Life"" is interesting.. Cool interpretation.."
2,"worth acquiring, but far from the best","It seems like this show was thrown together haphazardly at the last minute with little or no rehearsal.I may be wrong, but I think there was no audience. Frank's monologue in the beginning is met with a laugh track.The picture quality on the VHS is sub-standard; Sinatra's drummer, Irv Cottler, looks black!The skit with daughter is unmemorable.There is a good version of ""That's Life"", better than the studio version, but Frank muffs it at the end of ""My Kind Of Town"",If you're a Sinatra die-hard, then it's worth getting. For others looking for one of the better TV specials, stick to Vol 1 or 2."
5,.,"I'm a huge crocodile hunter fan and this video is a great recap of excite bits from some of the best episodes plus a few things you dind't see on camera. Its got some of the bits from indonesia when 2 komodo dragons chased him down, about a zillion snake bites ( includeing hte infamous timber ratter day! )< when terri started to fall off the cliff, and tons more. TOTALLY worht buying, even ifyorue not a fan per se its worth the watch."
2,"Some interesting parts, but . . .","I'd only seen one episode of the show when I purchased the video for my friend's son (age 12), and that episode was intense, informative and thrilling. With a title that includes ""most dangerous"" I expected more of the same, but the first segment with tiger sharks was downright boring. Lots of the same shots, lots of exclamations of wonder, but no real information - for example what were all the smaller fish swimming with the sharks? Baby sharks? Lamprey? The video does improve as it goes along, but with all the ""dangerous"" bits isolated Steve seems a bit of a fool and quite the pest to bother the poor animals! My twelve-year-old friend was not enthralled either, so I'd say skip this one and try one of the others."
3,Good Storage But The Handle Can Tear Off,"We bought 3 of these and they are heavy when they are full and the handle is only attached to the outer skin, so basically once it was full the outer cover torn and now you can not use the handle. Only one of the three has torn but we now know to be very careful with the others. The rest of it is put together really well. We have had other Body Glove CD/DVD cases and the handle is put on the others much better than this one."
1,"Bad ""Tracking"" on a DVD",I never even knew you could have bad tracking on a DVD. How is that acheived. Is that a new low in camera operations or in transferring from the VHS.
4,A must see,"Lisa Throw (a.k.a. Nenna Quiroz) is a multi-talented performer adept not only at looking gorgeous while swinging from jungle vines, but at playing her role for comic effect too. She sizzles on screen and should prove to be a valuable addition to the Surrender Girl Sorority""...Lisa's response, ""I was knocked out by the review of Shandra because the writer actually got what we were trying to do. I'm really looking forward to my next Surrender role."""
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!,"I just applied this to my baby, and she has been running around in pain for the past 10 minutes. At first I thought she was just over-reacting, after reading the other reviews online I now feel terrible. I just gave her a bath with and tried to get this ""treatment"" off of her. I am hoping the bath helped, avoid this product at all costs, please don't harm your poor animal!"
2,NOT with Oil Moisturizer!!!,"JUST opened this up and although it IS in the strength I wanted, it is NOT the relaxer with OIL MOISTURIZER!! I thought long and hard about returning it, but I chose to write a not-so-nice review because the photo is FALSE ADVERTISING! So, just letting all of you know. Yes, it IS the right strength, but NO - it's just the REGULAR Motions relaxer - NOT the one with Oil Moisturizer!!!"
2,Would not recommend for a glass/electric cooktop.,"I have a KitchenAid ceramic/glass electric cooktop that has the ability to combine two burners into a single oblong heated surface and have been looking to find a suitable griddle for this burner. This griddle is sized perfectly and seems to be highly recommended, so I gave it a shot. Granted, the manufacturer does not outwardly say that this griddle will work with an electric cooktop, but after reading a few reviews it seemed like a safe bet. Unfortunately the first one I received was warped very badly and did not sit flat on the cooktop (very important for a flat electric stove). I exchanged it for a second griddle, and to my disappointment, it was warped as well. I'm sending it back and will be continuing my search for a griddle."
5,Excellent Sound Quality.,"Out of all the King Biscuit cd's i own,this is the best as far as sound quality goes.the electric tunes start at track 5.The sound quality of the Romantics,Black Oak Arkansas,BTO,blackfoot,Iggy Pop all suck.those King Biscuit disc's are for die hard fans.on the plus side,Mountain and B.B. King sound good,but not as good as David Crosby."
1,My drive also died in 14 months,"I had almost the same experience of bad luck with a similar (200GB Firwire only) WD drive. I bought it in Dec 2002, and it crashed in March 2004. The customer service rep on the phone was very sympathetic and apologetic. However, she said she couldn't do anything with it, even it was just over warranty for a couple of months.Now I am searching the Web to see if someone had tried to replace the IDE drive inside the WD's Firewire enclosure. That's how I got here and learned about the similar experience from another user."
1,Wow! And I thought Star Trek novels were bad...,"I wanted dearly to love this book. I had such high hopes that this would be the catalyst for a renaissance in the Ghostbusters franchise. Within the first three chapters, however, my dreams were crushed. This book is pure drivel. There are major plot discrepancies (i.e. first something happened two years ago, then twenty pages later that same event is described as happening ten years ago), minimal character development, and the entire piece is laced with elementary grammatical errors. If you want to read something that will make the English teacher inside of you angry, read this novel. Pay particular attention to page 250, the sixth full paragraph that starts ""Winston looked up..."" Agh! It will drive you mad!"
1,Better read Sun's website,"The story build-up is terrible. Each time the authors try to explain something, they start talking about something else they promise to explain a few chapters later. Too much how, not enough why."
1,TRASH,MINE CAME LATE LATE LATE LIKE A MONTH LATE AND WAS USED ALREADY THE BOTTLE WAS OPEN AND HALF USED I WOULD HAVE RETURNED IT BUT I WOULD HAVE PAID MORE IN SHIPPING THAN IT WAS WORTH I GOT RIPPED OFF ON THIS ONE
4,A sign of the times,"I had purchased and used this product in the past for a very reasonable price and it always served me well, however, since the manufacturer no longer makes it the price skyrocketed and as a consumer I am a victim of obsolesence and old age."
1,Didn't Do Anything For My Cassette Deck,I've used the product several times to try to improve the sound quality of my dual cassette deck and have had no luck with this product. Sound quality is still poor and I've tried multiple cassettes. I'm going to purchase a tape demagnetizer next and see if that has any effect.
1,"Yep, another random screamo band",Absolutely nothing special here. Screamo DOES get old just like another reviewer said. There is nothing pretty or nothing chaotic about this record. Just very very boring. 1 star.
5,Wooden Victorian Dollhouse Review,"Unlike the expensive dollhouse kits, this dollhouse was easy to assemble. This dollhouse is made very similiar to the expensive dollhouse kits but for a whole lot less money. Dollhouse is adorable and comes painted with painted shingles and elaborate details such as a door that opens and closes and detailed molding around the windows. House comes with detailed real wood furniture that fills each room of the dollhouse with furniture left over. The furniture alone would cost a lot more than the dollhouse alone, but you get both for one great price. The only problem with the dollhouse is that the second floor of the dollhouse does not lay completely flat when inserted, most people would never even notice. Interior of the dollhouse could easily be painted or wall papered to accomadate a picky collector or a great project for a parent and child to engage in. My children and I, love this dollhouse as it provides hours of play a day for children and adults."
1,Nice price if it only worked,"Well, this works for two out of the five PCs now...not very useful. When the AC outlet supplying the power to the server went out, the functionality never came back after the power came back on. The PS Admin software can't see the print server, even though I know the connection is there because another PC on the network can still print on it. Too frustrating. The HP server with HP JetAdmin costs more, but life is too short to deal with this piece of #@#$%."
1,This is AWFUL,You would think this album was trying to make fun of Rascal Flatts instead of it being a tribute to them! The singers sound like they are holding their noses and are trying to sound bad. Just listen to the samples and see for yourself
4,what I expected,These are two cute TV Christmas movies. I decided it would be easier to have the dvds rather than have to wait until they come on the TV each year.
5,Very good,Information in here that is hard to find anywhere else. Extremely useful for people looking to move beyond presets and start designing their own sounds
5,Essential synthesis literature for space travel.,"Imagine that you're taking your first driver's lesson and sorta know what to do. You're no dummy. Previously you've understood what a steering wheel does and how it works in conjunction with wheels, etc. You know why some people need a dump-truck, and other's need a sport's car or minivan. Perhaps you've pulled the car out of the driveway several times or even rebuilt a car from scratch with a Haynes manual. But...you never learned to drift in a race or apply braking on any icy road. You know what nitro does and how to use it, but not when...Maybe you know generally what to do to make a car lighter and faster, but don't know how to tune it to the exact specifications you need to win the race. Mr. Welsh teaches you to drive a synth without a boring lecture on the history of cupholders. (A synth with cupholders? patent)Very simply: this book will teach you how to program with purpose. The Cookbook also arrived early and signed by the author."
5,"This is a ""MUST READ"" for the black powder shooter!!!",If you have even the slightest interest in shooting percussion revolvers or pistols you should not be without this book. The book is loaded with information ranging from the historic development of percussion handguns to actual load and chronograph data. Mike Cumpston has a writing flair unlike any I have read making this book a good source of entertainment as well as a valuable source of information. If you have no experience or even no interest in the subject then this book may well be all you need to get you interested.
4,Percussion Pistols and Revolvers,Good book and got it here in fast time. Lots of info on the history of the revolver. like it.
4,Enhance your reformer experience!,"I bought these straps to replace the ones that came with my Stamina Pilates Premier reformer, and it was a wise purchase. Now I have more length for my legs and less for my arms without changing the handles. And these are much more comfortable than the plastic/velcro combination that came with my reformer. The only reason that I gave them 4 stars rather than 5 is because I think they would have been easier to install with a hook attachment rather than a D-ring. It took me a long time to attach them to the ropes so that they were both perfectly even, but that's a relatively small thing."
5,Heinrich Hoffman,There is no better children's author than Heinrich Hoffman. If you don't know his work... you need to find out about it. This book is incredible. It is my favorite... my daughter's favorite too.
5,Sums it all up!,"This book collects all the little tidbits of info concerning compiling, writing make files, debugging and more into a hand reference book. It is good for people who know C/C++, but don't know the Un*x toolset."
3,Unrelentingly somber,"Unrelentingly somber and depressing story about a young Bangladeshi woman sent to the U.K. for an arranged marriage to an unexciting and marginally successful Muslim businessman. You can feel the movie fumbling to deal with issues of female empowerment and growth, multiculturalism, and post-9/11 politics, but it evolves into a soapy romantic triangle that doesn't go anywhere. Supposedly this film was based on a highly regarded novel; if so, it doesn't do the book justice."
3,Joan's all good,"Joan plays Nurse Lucretia Terry in this 1960's shocker. Lucretia Terry is an unsympathetic and careless nurse, working in a mental hospital. I think the film would have been a lot better if Joan's character was developed more. It also lacked some type of substance and there wasn't really a climax. My favorite scene is when Joan is giving the self-defense class. She looks so cute in the black leotard. If you'd like to see Joan in a picture that she made later in her career (her older ones weren't all bad), then I recommend ""Straight-Jacket."" Nevertheless, even a bad picture (like ""Caretakers"") is still good if Joan Crawford is in it!"
3,Joan In the loonie bin,"An enjoyable melodrama with some insight into how those with mental issues were treated. This was Ms Crawford's next movie (completed) after ""whatever happened to baby jane"" and she is fab as a steely and determined nurse. The movie is worth watching for the judu scence alone"
1,The New Motown Is To Blame,"First of all, let me say that if nothing else the cover is beautiful and the pictures were enjoyable. I'm a young woman, however the songs that were released on this album are the same songs that I have always indenifed with the Supremes and have therefore been on compilation after compilation. Where are the previously unreleased tracks? As a buyer, this is the last time I will be sucker to nice packaging & promotion by the likes of Motown. Give us the gems that haven't seen the light of day and it would be nice to keep the ones that are already known in tact! Some of this material was downright butchered."
4,HARD,"this game is HARD, but very fun so if you want to pick between Fantastic Four or some other comic book game, just get the hulk... and if you do, collect your patience because this game will hand it to you."
3,"Gentle teaching, covers all bases.","If your child likes Bear, he/she will like this video. My daughter was already doing very well with the potty training when I bought this, so I'm not sure how much it helped her. She enjoyed watching it and sang along with the songs. I babysit two other children who are 2 1/2 that have no interest in ""going in the potty"" and had very little interest in watching the video. Video was almost ""too gentle"". No we cannot force our children to get potty trained but should reinforce the importance of training firmly."
2,its ok but more like the tv show,i just got this dvd for my daughter she is interested in using the potty and knows when she needs to go i used a video for my oldest and it helped but i no longer have the video so i thought this would be good she like bear. how ever its just like the show and doesn't really get to the potty point. its cute but doesn't really get the point across to her its just another dvd to watch.
2,"Enteraining, but not motivating.","My son loved the video. He can sing all the songs to it! However, it in no way made him want to use the toilet. He thought it was funny that the mouse used the toilet, but made no connection to the fact that he should be using the toilet too. I would recommend the book if you want your kids to learn some fun songs while on the potty, but not for much else"
2,Too slow for us.,"I did like that the character's use of a normal toilet and not a separate potty. We have only taught our daughter to use toilets. That was one of the main reason's I wanted this video. However, it does spend too much time with other scenes and not actual toilet training. Plus there is only one movie of toilet training out of 3 on the DVD."
3,"It was okay....but my daughter responded better to ""potty power""","My daughter has been a huge fan of bear since she was tiny. I had heard several good things about the Bear potty episode, and decided what the heck. After reading the reviews on some other potty-type DVDs I saw one called ""potty power"" that had gotten good reviews, and decided to give it a try too (plus it put me over the $25 so I could get free shipping haha). I must say she liked the bear DVD, but potty power gave us IMMEDIATE results. From the first night she watched potty power she has not had an accident since--I think something just ""clicked"" with her.IMO, Bear was fun to watch, but it didn't really lay it all out there like potty power did. I didn't feel like it was blunt enough for my daughter, but that was just my experience.Anyway, if you are looking for a potty DVD, I would give bear a try, but also maybe go check out Potty Power as well."
2,Not if you're a radio listener,"This is a sleek clock radio with a very handy way of plugging in your Ipod. You receive a whole set of Ipod base adapters so that you can use a variety of models. Having said that, be advised that this unit is not for those who will want to listen to radio very much. At first glance, this appears to be a digitally-tuned radio. And I think it might really be. The radio frequency number appears on the LED read-out as you tune. The huge problem is that there are no pre-sets. Each time you want to change stations, you must turn an incredibly sensitive thumb wheel. You must tune up and down each frequency very carefully. If you want an AM station at 1070, you must be very precise or you will land on 1060 or 1080. The same goes for FM. This radio is only for those who listen to only one station most of the time. With the other nice features, and the price, it is hard to understand why the engineers did not add pre-sets for the radio frequencies."
3,GREAT ! Almost...,"Works very well but had two design problems.The 'drawer' would not open. Spring was in wrong place. Fixed OK.The insert for an I-Pod Nano would not accept it, too short. Bit of filing and now is fine.The USB is super. Volume should allow presets for wake up. It doesn't. It will be the same as when you shut it down.No AUX IN and no headphone jack.Still. Recommended."
1,RCA RP5500i Universal iPod Dock AM/FM Clock Radio,When I plugged in the clock radio only one half of the LCD display was readable. It would not properly display the time. I sent it back
2,Fairly useless,"The book skips around too much (far too much ""For X, see Chapter X"") and barely skims the surface of XML. It doesn't even delve into the more useful applications for XML, and everything that's in this book can be had for free on the web. Don't waste your money. Go to Yahoo! instead and find some XML tutorials. Once you wrap your head around those, move on to more advanced XML texts by Wrox."
4,Good Concise Intro to XML,"I looked at several XML books, and I found this one to be the best at introducing XML concepts in a clear and concise way. This book is not a ""bible"" or complete reference by any means. However, it is a really good way to get started with XML. I highly recommend this book followed up by more complete references."
2,Not the best movie!,"Let's just say I have seen many better movies. I think they just used bits and pieces from other movies and threw something together. If this is like the graphic novel, then 30 Day's of Night is alot better. If you have choices to make on buyig movies choose something else."
1,Just plain bad,I bought this movie for Casper Van Dien and Kim Cattrail and the hope that it would be a fun vampire movie. I fast forwarded through a lot of it due to the fact that it was not that interesting. I could not find one character in the movie to root for or care about. If you want a fun vamp show with a character to root for stick with Buffy.
3,Not originally $132.00,"This dish is definitely not worth $132.00. I think Amazon misprices some of their merchandise--because I saw the ENTIRE set when I actually went to a Mikasa store, the WHOLE dish set (probably a 30, 50 or 80 piece set) was being sold for $130, not that one dish! Very misleading! Therefore, be careful when trying to bargain shop on Amazon--don't be misled by the original price tag they give you.When the merchandise came in the mail (I ordered 4 because I thought I was getting a good deal), the dishes did not come in boxes that said ""Mikasa"" but in cardboard makeshift boxes that were taped together; not giftable at all. Granted, the dishes were exactly as I imagined they would be; just not giftable."
4,My Parents Gave it to me,After working for 6 months... it was like a lightbulb and everything clicked. I looked at it before my first review so I would know how to prepare and thought it had provoking questions and insights.
3,vibration and loss of suction,"This blast gate is part of ductwork system provided by grizzly.In use I found that those blast gate tend to vibrate it they are not lock in place with the screw provided. The problem with using the screw is that it is 1/ time consuming 2/ cause a little opening at the back causing a loss of suction. I have updated my sytem to use 6"" blast gate right of the main pipe and have much better results"
3,My second one in 5 years,I use this pan to pan-sauté steaks and other meats that would otherwise stick. The pan is not as stick-proof as it claims to be. Residuals from the meats and spices get stuck -- and worse over time. It takes longer to soak to get everything off as time passes.I use this pan several times a week as I eat a lot of meat. After about 2 1/2 years -- the pan is pretty much shot.But I figure for $20 I won't ruin other good pans and I will just buy a new one as I am now -- on my 3rd pan.
5,great,"This is a cute-looking pot that is solidly built. The handle doesn't get as hot as I imagined considering that it is metal when just boiling water for a short period of time, but if the pot has been heated for a long time please use an oven mitt."
4,A Little Aint Enough........,"Well he's back - he's in fine form and he sounds like he's having a whale of a time. This is different to some of his more recent stuff (its tuneful!) and it really grows on you. One thing Dave - please stop singing some of that real high stuff (you started it on Your Filthy Little Mouth album - when you discovered you had an extra Octave range). Its spoiling some of your singing and it sounds like you're straining.Come on, give it a listen - you wont be disappointed."
3,It's Okay,I bought this film to use in my high school social studies classes. I found that I was unable to do so. The program is very slow and just shows the primary footage.
5,An Old Favorite Who Ages Well,"The late Roger Miller was one of the earliest country artists I enjoyed, back more years than I like to think about. This CD includes all the songs that appeared on my original vinyl of his hits. From the thoughtful (""Husbands and Wives"") to the chillingly sad (""One Dyin' and a Buryin'"") to Miller's specialty, novelty classics like ""Dang Me,"" ""Kansas City Star,"" and ""You Can't Roller Skate in a Buffalo Herd,"" they're all here. And the remaster captures his unique Fort Worth voice and styling faultlessly. If you plan to buy only one Miller retrospective, this should be it. (And it's reasonably priced, too!)"
5,great reading,"While I don't agree with Sonny on everything, he does have a good book that gives you a different outlook on things most folks already know"
3,A quick read,"If you wanted to write a biker version of 'Chicken Soup for the Soul', this is what it might look like. That said this book is so brief, such a small insight into the Hell's Angles/biker culture and perspective it barely merits review. It has a few gems of wisdom, but most of those are like quartz, widely available. Worth a read if you find it on your local library shelf, otherwise you can miss this book and never miss it."
5,Truth and the American Way....way back when,"I just got this book and love it. Sonny Barger has taken his years of hard living and forged a gem from it in wise words and lessons learned.Although I don't share his opinion of law enforcement, since we do need them around, I do share his love of country, making family of friends when your own family isn't there and never has been, his ability to keep the faith with his club and friends and get it back in return.As a fellow freedom lover, I like this book and wish a lot of folks would read it and take from it something to use in their own life. Make the best of this life and don't take any, well, you know what. Best to Sonny. If he writes any more books, I'm reading them. He's good at this."
5,MUST READ,Everyone can learn something from this book. It provides easy to understand logic that can be applied to your life.
