2,"Some good ideas, but a REALLY slow book","I bought this book based on other recommendations about its great ideas involving long life, godlike powers and nanotechnology. BUT, but I really wish I had not gotten this book. This book was painful to read, due to the overly florid prose - kind of like reading court transcripts from ""Olde Englande"".There is WAY too much of the book that is spent in dialogue between characters. I finally got interested about halfway through, but then it dragged ON and ON and ON until the so-called resolution. Then you are left hanging, since it really won't be resolved until the next book in the series.I had less fun reading this book than any I've read in the last two years!"
1,This is just the index!,"I wondered why this was inexpensive compared with the other versions of this I have found, well it is because it is nothing but the index for the other volumes. Very disappointing."
2,difficult to use,This ashtray take two hands to put out a cigarette. It is very clumsy. I threw the ones I bought for people away.
1,not happy,THE PICTURE SHOWS THAT IT HAS A HOLDER ....IT DOES NOT HAVE ONE WITH IT ... THE HOLDER EVEN HAS THE CLIP CLAP LOGO ON IT SO I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IT HAD ITS OWN HOLDER .. KIND OF LOOKED TO ME LIKE IT ATTACHED TO A VENT..NOT REAL HAPPY WITH PRODUCT... YOU SHOULD UP DATE THE PICTURE AND SPECIFY THAT LOOKS CAN BE DISCEIVING
2,Big dissappointment worst in the series,"It started out okay but when i got to the end of pokemon emergency oh my god its all ready at vermillion city i mean come on there's at least 5 episodes cut out. The author has no paitence, nor imaganation. The only reason i gave it 2 stars is because it had good translations to pokemon i choose you and pokemon emergency otherwise it's cruddy. Serious fans: don't buy this you'll be dissappointed Little kids and not so serious fans MIGHT like it. It is easy to read, so younger fans will get the most out of it. Older fans won't like it though (most likely)"
4,It was about Ash getting his first Pokemon,I've seen all the shows in this book and I think I like the TV shows better. I want to see the new Pokemon movie. I think it's gonna be really cool. I especially want to see the part about Pikachu's vacation.
5,Does what it says,It's hard to fall in love with an air filter. It does what it does.But i see no reason to pay more for a simple air filter when this one by FRAM is just fine.
5,Fram CA9054,This is a great product. The price I paid was much lower than I would have paid locally and it arrived in two days.
4,"In depth, well written and not in love with Mr. O'Leary","I bought this book in Ireland and read it on the way back onAer Lingus. The author writes well and does an in-depth studyof the airline and how it came into being. She gives all the right personalities their due and carefully details the airline's move from its Ireland UK routes to its expansion in Europe. She effectively strips Michael O'Leary of his PR star status making him out to be juvenile, abusive, deceitful yet an effective swashbuckling airline buccaneer. When I came to the part about the way the Ryanair mistreats the disabled by charging them for the use of wheelchairs and making them claw their way up the plane's steps on the tarmac, the thought rocketed into my mind that I would exercise my rights not want to fly Ryanair even - if the price was free."
2,Nice grape smell but too thick,"I have detailed automobiles for over 20 years and prefer Meguiar's products. This is an OK product but one I would never buy again. The consistency was too thick resulting in more product being used, and takes at least four times longer to apply. You have to apply in smaller areas over and over again to work the product into each crevice between letters, numbers, ridges, etc. similar to polishing metal. Just too tedious. This would be fine if the tires looked better but I find they look that same as the other higher-end tire shine products. The grape smell was very nice but that's about it. I'll stick with Meguiar's Hot Shine for overall ease of application, speed and quality of shine."
4,The best i've found...,"I am a life long fan of Meguiars products. I also happen to run my own automotive detailing business and this is simply the best tire shine that I've found to date. I always recommend using a gel because they tend to hold up longer, and they also apply much cleaner than spraying an aerosol without having to worry much about getting it all over surfaces that you do not desire it on. No, it is not the shiniest product available on the market. However, it does live up to its name and purpose of ""endurance"". I've just about tried them all and this one keeps tires looking their best for the longest amount of time. Sure, it is nice to have deep black tires, especially for show cars, however, for the typical consumer this one is much more practical. If you are looking to get the deepest blacks possible try Meguiars Hot Shine. Please be advised however that this hot shine will be short lived and don't be surprised when your tires are ""brown"" in short time."
2,Less than Average.,"There are good things and bad things about this. First the good:@Seven whole songs on an EP!@Three brand new tracks, two of which rock!@Good enhanced content that doesn't mess up your computer.Now the bad.@The Alice in Chains cover doesn't even come close to the Original.@The freaking Out Remix is Awful.@The way you like itremix is edited.@They are no good in concert so they should avoid live tracks at all costs@The Giving in remix is no different than the original. I honestly can not find ONE difference.@They still sound exactly like Korn.Pick up the Full length."
1,an insult to alice in chains,"first off, the song nutshell, is not an adema song. It's an alice in chains song! anybody that thinks that it's an adema song is retarded! And yes they did really did screw it up, it sounds horrible. The the AIC masterpiece is 100x times better. End of story"
1,Nobody even knows that this is actually out!!!,"Well, seems like we have another washed-up Nu-Metal band that is still trying to hold on to whatever money they have left because they know that it's not 2000 anymore. Anyway, this is just horrible. Adema should all be assissnated be trying, and failing horrednously, to cover an Alice In Chains shong. Funny thing is that no-one even knows this E.P. is out!"
4,satisfied,"These shoes are just was I was looking for. Pretty true-to-size, a little snug but another size higher would be too big. The heel is perfect height, very sexy!"
5,Seamless replacement.,I bought this item to replace a failed factory part.It performed flawlessly until I replaced the Magellan. Nuff said.J in P-town.
5,a look at the awesome power of the media,"As a former NOAA employee stationed in Seattle at the time of this ""non""event, I found Tom Rose's account absolutely remarkable for digging into the history, politics, and profound human-interest surrounding this particular one-of-many incidents of whales stranded in the ice. Tom Rose brought incredible insight into the humor and pathos of the remarkable media extravaganza. When 150 reporters from all over the world descended on the unique tiny plot of civilization known as Barrow, Alaska, the sensational power of worldwide communications astounded all experts.It's the best nonfiction I have read in my 86 years of life."
2,Product didn't work enough for me but seller was good.,"Five stars for the seller: item was reasonably priced, well packed, and quickly shipped.Unfortunately, the product did not work for me. I did get a small effect if I used it many times a day -- but that would have required a bottle every couple of days. Other people reviewing it have mentioned it working well and quickly on occasional doses. The package does say that someone might have to start with dosing every fifteen minutes or every hour to begin with. I dosed every couple of hours for a few days -- but would have had to buy more bottles to continue.Perhaps it would have worked if I'd invested in several bottles and done it more intensively first -- but after the very low response, I was reluctant to pay more. So, maybe it would have worked better after days of very high dosing, maybe not. I can't say - but obviously not everyone has the great reaction some people are fortunate enough to have."
3,Interesting...,"This is a great book to kill time with when your bored. There is no real depth to the characters but Monica White took a situation and wove together a book with some substance to it. I enjoyed the whole romance factor of the storyline such as the meetings and the sex but the conflict the female character was going through never really came across as a major part of the storyline. Its hard to believe that a woman scared of any serious relationship one minute can turn around and fall deeply in love, in a couple of months with a man who brings in a lot of difficulties into her life. Bottom line this is not a book to be analyzed at every page instead to be enjoyed for a pure feel good time."
2,An OK book,I read this book several years ago and found it to be a so-so read. It was very easy to read in one day.
3,Don't waste time on this one,The female character was very weak.The book was OK but the female character was so annoying.I liked No Commitment Required better.
1,HORRIBLE,"I thought the book was HORRIBLE. I am sorry that I paid money for text that appeared to have been written by a 6th grader. No story, no character development. Ridiculous."
2,"Admirable lesson, simplistic treatment","Each year, I dig into the works of a classic children's writer. Eleanor Estes caught my attention because her novels, many published 60 years or more ago, have recently been reissued. This one has terrific illustrations by Louis Slobodkin, a huge talent in his own arena. The story here is simple, which may be obvious, but I'm fascinated by how something so basic becomes so beloved. The writer's style is skilled and serviceable, but there's nothing magical about the language (as with E.B. White). The dated material is occasionally offputting. The main characters are so thinly sketched as to be cliche. And the true payoff, the reality of the ""hundred dresses,"" is almost thrown away. Is the childhood memory of a beloved book what makes it a classic?"
3,"A book not just for girls, boys love it too!","The Hundred Dresses is a wonderful book for all ages. It is about a young girl, name Wanda, who says she has a hundred dresses but two other girls make fun of her and ask her everyday ""what kind of dresses do you have?"" Wanda gets very upset about them always asking these questions. One of the girls Peggy is the most popular girl in class. She always makes fun of Wanda and makes Wanda sad. The other girl is named Maddie and she feels sorry for Wanda but she doesn't stand up for Wanda because she wants to stay friends with Peggy. Lots of kids in schools today have similar problems and this book could maybe help them solve these issues.This book made me feel happy, emotional and it made me laugh."
5,Quite Pleased,The book arrived promptly and in excellent condition. What more can one ask for when ordering on line!
5,excellent condition,This book arrived before said date as well as in great condition. I bought this book for group at the day care I teach at for the summer. We are learning about England and saw this was a good book to read to them. It also has a great moral as well.
1,expexted for much more from HP,The barcode is hard to install . no software is found on HP site.plus the most disturbing thing on the barcode is that after you scan you MUST press to ENTER key.plus many products it cant scan..............
5,Works great,"This was the first Bluetooth headset I had ever purchased - necessitated by a Washington law which will require hands-free cell phone use while driving. There is certainly a diversity of opinion on headsets, but since Plantronics went to the moon, I thought it would probably go to I-5 pretty well. The 340 is easy to use and people on the other end of the line tell me that the sound quality is excellent."
4,Plantronics Bluetooth,This is my second Plantronics and it works as promised. Very economical when compared to others. Amazon has a good price and item was shipped quick.
2,I thought it would be much better,"I thought that Plantronics was a decent brand, when I bought it. I now think that the Radio Shack ""Voice Star"" is better. I bought the Plantronics when I broke the ear piece off the Radio Shack Blue Tooth I had. The Plantronics is paired with a Motorola Razr Phone. With such a combination I find a lot of disconnects occur, sometimes during a call. Sometimes I have to re-pair the Plantronics to the Phone, because it shuts down the phones Bluetooth (go figure). Other times I have to shut the phone off, and Headset off, and turn them all on again. Perhaps with a differnet phone this Headset would be better.I just know it not very reliable, and I've had to use my phones speaker-phone to be hands free at times.I will say it is comfortable on the ear though, and when it does work, it good."
4,Get something straight here!,"For all of you who are saying 'oh her top is so skimpy, it doesn't stay on, blah blah blah'; I think this needs to be said: IT'S A FAIRY DOLL!!! Of course her top is going to be skimpy! And if you have a problem with that shirt please just keep your mouth shut cause welcome to the world of fairies and make belief!Thank you for your time."
4,"Gosh, this doll is ugly!","I got this doll from my grandma as a present. I renamed my doll Violet and sprite Lavender. To tell the truth, I like the sprite better. The doll's eyelashes are really long and ugly, but her hair is beautiful . It is a rich shade of red and is in braids. There are a couple smaller braids tied into the larger braid. And to inform other reviewers, if the wings break off, they just pop back on. I ususly just leave the wings off so I can put Violet in other clothes. The little sprite is very cute. I took off her wings, though. She looks better without them. The big doll's clothes are pretty, but not as durable as Mattel could have made them. The part of the shirt that goes by the neck broke off and a bit of the skirt ripped. Overall, I give it a 4 stars because of the big dolls's uglyness and the bad durablity."
5,Best Steps Ever,"I bought two of these steps (one for upstairs and one for downstairs) for my daughter when she was 2 and started potty training. She's 3 now and still uses them everyday to independantly wash her hands, brush her teeth and reach higher shelves on her bookshelf. They are in great shape and perfect working order still! This is one of the best steps because it is higher than many steps out there, but the 2-step design makes it easier for smaller children to use."
3,"OK, way to big though!!","I bought these because I wear glasses an have a fairly large head, but these were entirly to big. They are heavy and have a funny and unconfortable fit. I would not suggest these to anyone. The one good thing I can say about these is that Amazon was hassle free with the refund, they even paid for shipping!!"
3,big frame,"I wear glasses so OTG google were important. I saw these and the features and price looked good, so I took the plunge. I wore these about 10 times total. The good features are that the tint works well for various condtions. The polarized lens help with glare. They don't fog up very easily. The major problem with these is the size of the googles. They say they are helmet compatible, but they really aren't. The frame is so tall that a helmet will push the googles down on your face and possible over your nose. I tried adjusting my helmet and the googles and the two would not work together. In case it matters, I am using a Giro Sestriers helmet. I have since bought some Oakley's that work fine with my helmet. The lens on the Oakley is not as nice, but they fit better and are more comfortable."
1,Weak adjustment plastic parts,When they get cold (these are ski goggles after all) the plastic snaps that allow the strap to be adjusted get brittle and snap. This happened on my FIRST use at 10F temperature. The cheap plastic snaps broke. I guess I could repair/restitch new (metal) ones in - but why? As long as you don't adjust the straps they should be OK I suppose?
5,Great goggles,"I recommend this google highly. This beautiful google works really well. The only negative, perhaps, is that it might be too large for some people."
1,Think Twice,"I have had it with this tool. First I couldn't remove the cutter, the allen wrench actually broke; then the cheap fence broke. The local PC repair shop replaced the entire tool. Now one year later, I can't remove the cutter again. Poor design; shame on PC. Buy the Lamello."
1,Disappointed with the product,"This product was purchased as a birthday present for my husband. Unfortunately, it arrived bent/warped and unfunctional. So, we returned it. A replacement product arrived with the same problem. So, we took it to a local Porter-Cable retail outlet and they corrected the problem. It turns out that certain batches of this product were known to be defective. My question is: Why would Porter-Cable and amazon.com sell this product with a known defect ?"
1,"nice out of the box, but not for industrial use","I know this is a popular tool and has garnered good reviews in comparison tests. I liked it when I first started using it but after about 500 cuts I noticed the plunger wasn't working as smoothly as before, and I keep my tools clean & oiled. The sliding mechanism was wearing out far too rapidly than a 'professional' tool should. Then one day at work it just went dead; hadn't been dropped, wasn't overheated. So I probably got about 1000 cuts on this machine. The replacement? A Lamello, what I should have gone for originally."
5,Well made tool,"I love this tool. It's easy to set up and mine has precision accuracy with the gauges. Construction quality is the best. None of the cheesy plastic chit-chat found in some of today's so-called ""quality"" tools.Changing blades from FF 2"" to Standard and back is a snap. With the precision this tool is capable of, if there's room for the slot, and you're familiar with the tool, you can put a biscuit in it with no problem, right down to to 1 1/2"".Can't think of anything I don't like about this tool. I wouldn't have any trouble recommending it to anyone."
1,It died on the job,My few years old Porter Cable 557 biscuit joiner died on the job. Even if it is few years old I hardly used this biscuit joiner. I had Riobi and upgraded ?) to porter cable. I miss my beat up old Riobi. Gear box of PC is all messed up. Blade moves up and down and eating aluminum slot. I would not buy porter cable again. Cheap Riobi never gave me any troule and much easier to handle and lighter. I thought heavy weight of Poter Cable was sign of quality. It was just dead weight.
1,On with the leaks...,"Pretty much in agreement with everyone else here. It's been in for less than a year, and just started leaking from the base. What a waste of money."
1,Looks nice - but leaks alot,Like the other reviewer I have a similar problem with this faucet. It leaks at the base of the handle any time you turn it on. And from some other reviews I've read - even if you do repair it with the parts from Kohler it'll just leak again within a year. Horrible product.
4,Good,I liked this book. It moved along well and was fairly suspense-full. I liked the was the writer kept up the plot.
2,Not worth the money,My daughter recieved this for Christemas. She is 5. She also has the playset from the fairytopia line. What a waste of money. The wings always fall off and the way they clip on makes it impossible to put other clothes on the doll. The other day she took off the clothes and put them on another barbie. Don't waste your 17.99.
1,Not fun to do!,"My fiance and I are taking dance lessons to prepare for our wedding and borrowed this DVD from our public library to supplement our practices. I am so glad we didn't buy it! I wholeheartedly agree with the other review--the instruction is confusing at best and the segments of each dance are very short. If you try it, you need to have your own music to practice with, as there isn't much on the DVD.Overall, we are disappointed and will be returning the DVD as soon as we can get back to the library!"
3,better than average only because of Never too far,"if it weren't for ""Never Too Far""&Her Vocals being Good on it I'd give this Set of single a One.""Don't Stop"" is a Very Weak Re-Make of TOm Browne's Classic"" Jamaica Funk"".""Loverboy"" the Re-Make of Cameo's ""Candy"" is even Worse as a Cover here.but the lead single saves them a bit."
4,Great product - works as advertised,Used this in our shower to clean the marble tiles and it worked as advertised. It does not seem to contain harsh chemicals and did not have a strong odor as do some other cleaning products. After I cleaned the tiles I let the grout and tiles dry out for 3 days then applied a sealer that prevents water from being absorbed into the grout and tile. Overall the results were very good and I recommend this product.
2,sk,I gave up on this book. What a disappointment. I agree with the previous comment that this book was not reviewed before it was published. Since I have been a proofreader for several years I find it impossible to continue reading it.
2,all facts not accurate,"I live very close to where this crime happened and worked with someone who dated one of the killers-years before this happened. Some of the facts about the area aren't accurate. I also felt it was just a quicky write, not enough back ground and details. Maybe it was for the best that is it written this way as it is such a sad, sad story. I just thought it could have been written better."
1,Follow the book........,"If you liked the book, you'll hate the movie. Totally miscast, we needed a large, scary Helga!Who wrote the screen play? They changed everything I liked about the book. I hate it when a really good story gets butchered!"
1,Very disappointing!,"If you have read the book you will not want to see this movie as you will be disappointed as I was. Very little content followed the book and worse yet it made Mary Ingles 800+ mile journey home look like a short hike in the woods. Her journey home is a remarkable story of human endurance and determination but you would never have any idea of what she and the old Dutch woman actually endured by watching this movie. It's a great injustice to a very remarkable and true story. As another reviewer stated ""Bland at best"". Not recommended."
5,good Italian book,I have been to Sicily with other phrase books -- this is a very good book to assist a tourist at various venues in Italy. Ciao.
4,Italian Phrase Book,Very helpful and will be used on our vacation in Italy in November 2013. We also have a tape which assists with the proper accent.
5,Just what I needed,I love this book! I wanted something small and just the basic of learning a new lanuage. It has much more than I need but it will come in very handy. I use it everyday to find new words and the pronunciation has been a great help! Perfect for beginners and Great Size to carry with you on your travels.
2,Too hard to use!,"We found this book very cumbersome when we needed words quickly during our trip! How crazy to put all the words into categories! Just try and find the correct category when you're having a conversation!!!! URGH. We were in a shop buying a gift for someone and wanted to have the item shipped. So crazy, had to leave without finding the information. This happened numerous times during our 10 day stay. I won't make that mistake again. Did everyone memorize the book before traveling?"
4,Fun Twee-Pop,"Kloey generates some cool, fun music during their ""After School Special"" release. This album contains some low-fi gems that beg to be loved. My favorite on the album is ""Gotta, Gotta"" which is a bouncy, sing-song affair about moving on. I also enjoy ""together"" which is a sad, heartbreaker about patching things up. This album has it's failings. Some songs are way too brief. For instance ""Change For The Better"" ends just as it's getting good. Also, the production at times is a little rough. In the hands of a good pop producer (Perhaps Andy from Ivy) this album could've been near-perfect.Bottom line: This album is pretty good and affordable. Check it out if you like indie-pop."
1,doesn't work,"brought the game because of the reviews here. but when i tried to play it, it wouldn't start. checked the web for solutions, they had created 2 patches for the game but the patches are not available when i tried to download them. dissapointed. it sounded like a fun game."
3,Far too short,"The levels have good points, the graphic violence is beautifully done with 3-D body parts flying everywhere, and the game makes you think. But with only five levels and an end boss, it really is FAR TOO SHORT. with this in mind, you beat it once and may never want to play it again. It may just be a waste of money. The original Quake is better. Even 2-d Doom holds more fun then this. Don't expect to be at this for very long."
3,a okay game,this quake game i a little better than the first. it was okay. like i said in the other review if you like this type of game that its for you.
5,It's liberals who are mean spirited!!,This is a great book and i'm disappointed that this book has yet to get the press it deserves.This shows the hidden agenda of liberals and their New World Order mentality and it's shocking to say the least.This is a great gift to those on the left who always claim that Conservatives are mean spirited since it details the chronicles of the new thought police!
4,RENEWED HOPE,"I HAVE LYMES DISEASE, AND HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY THE LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE WHOLE DISEASE. FINALLY SOMEOME HAS BROKEN DOWN LYMES IN TWO DISTINCT CATERGORIES THAT ARE TREATABLE. THE FIRST BEING NEUROTOXIN MEDIATED ILLNESS AND THE OTHER A BACTERIAL INFECTION. CONGRATULATIONS DR. RITCHIE SHOEMAKER FOR ALL YOU COMPASSION AND PIONEERING THOUGHT. I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS BOOK FOR ANYONE WHO LIKE ME HAD WAS LOST IN THE SEA OF PRESCRIPTIONS FOR EVERY SYMPTOM. THERESA GILL"
2,Disappointing,"If you are used to the top cockpit simulation games (such as the X-Wing/Tie Fighter games and Mechwarrior 3 and 4), then this game will be a bit of a disappointment. The controls are simplistic, particluarly compared to the awesome X-Wing Alliance. The graphics are just ok, and the gameplay is more akin to a arcade shooter than a real PC sim.If you are looking for a game that will give you the thrill of flying an X-Wing (or a Y-Wing, an A-Wing, a B-Wing, or even the Millenium Falcon) then buy X-Wing Alliance, or the classic X-Wing and Tie Fighter games."
4,I have flown some missions but not all,"The X-wings have a slight lag in the control. When the speeders turn its not quite as sharp as the real speeder and much is slower. If you don't know me, read the book X-wing wraith Squadron. Wish me luck in marrying Tyria!"
3,A little much,"The movie featured Leighanne Wallace (she played Tanna) and I think that she did a great job. However, her part was small. There should've been a little less focus on the animals, and a little more on the relationships between the three boys and their parents, etc. However, it was fun to watch, espically if you're a fan of one of the actors."
5,True Story,This movie is based on a true story. I bought for my Grandson so he could get the confidence to follow his dreams!
2,Wrong book,I wanted the God Always has a Plan B by Hallmark and I got a different book in the mail with the same title.
1,"if i could a zero star, i would.....","this guitar is shockingly bad- cheaply made and broke withing one minute of my tiny two year old touching it, the bridge fell off, the strings snapped when we tried to tune it. The extra string (yes, that's singular) didn't even fit! don't waste your money!"
4,Inexpensive and effective,"This flat license plate shield is great... it covers my entire plate and paired w/ a Cruiser black frame it looks awesome.I gave it four stars because it's not as tinted as it looks in the picture, but I'm sure it's for legal purposes."
1,Cocoa Butter lip balm is worse than bad,"Cocoa Butter Lip Balm, .15 oz, 6 PackI bought a bunch of the Cocoa Butter lip balm and feel really ripped off. It has no SPF like what I have purchased when available in retail stores. Plus it feels awful on my lips - like plain old, old hard chapstick. I don't think there is any cocoa butter in it although they list it on ingredients. I'm wondering how do I get my $ back???"
3,Bottlecaps: Good Candy but Not a Favorite,"Bottlecaps have never been one of my favorite candies. They have a nice sweet flavor that is not overpowering and a pleasant chalky texture, similar to Sweetarts but even a little softer. The flavors are mostly cola like flavors, which is what I don't care too much for. But if you are one that likes that flavor, these are certainly a high quality and tasty candy."
4,living the life,"This is an interesting movie. To be based on a bodybuilder, there is less emphasis on the bodybuilding, and more on the life of. There is not much said on diet and training (not a bad thing, just stating). You get to see Jay live his life, guest posing, working booths, opening stores, and promoting the sport. I personally wish there would have been more on his training and diet, but I am sure that can be found in some of his other movies (this is the only one i own). This movie is worth the buy though, especially since it is Jays first year as mr olympia."
2,Starter Set and Booster Packs Have Same Figures,"Our grandson wanted the Attacktix Battle Figure Game for his birthday. He had one piece and was excited to _build a squad_ as Hasbro advertises. We were very disappointed when trying to order the battle figures that while advertised, few are actually available. We ordered several pieces including a starter set and then the booster packs that were available. Amazingly the Starter Set and the Booster Pack, advertised to increase the squad, contained two out of three of the same figures. While the toy may well appeal to young boys in particular, the marketing plan is deceptive and disappointing."
5,Excellent game for all ages!,I was pretty skeptical when my husband brought this home to 'play' with but I have to say it's actually a lot of fun. It is easy to learn and comes with a CD-ROM that shows you how to play in about 10-15 minutes. It's not totally uneducational too - there is some math involved and you could incorperate many math problems into the game without your child knowing.If you want to introduce your kids to Star Wars this is the way to do it - this game is very entertaining!
5,The game and best parts,I think this is a great game and anyone would like that likes to think snd still have fun. The age group for this game in my opinion would be about 8-and up. I thought that this was a fun game that made you think for a change.
2,"It's ok..., but with some problems","The clock runs ok..., but with a few hiccups:1) The minute arm is always faster by 2 minutes and I can't adjust it.2) Since the Day Light Saving time was changed with the start and end dates, the clock follows the old start and end dates."
2,It melts in the Sun,Beware of Sun exposure.I placed the black version of this clock in a shop window facing the street that gets full sun. Over the summer the black plastic backing warped severely thus destroying the clock.
1,Would not set,"Says it sets atomically to time in Boulder, CO. But it doesn't. Amzaon return policy rips you off on return. Read the fine print. Buyer beware."
2,"A good book, but definetly not one of Koontz's best","Twilight Eyes was hardly a page turner, or a ""go tell all your friends to read it"" book, but it was not purely awful at the same time. Twilght Eyes was, to me, a rather boring piece of work from Koontz, and it was not very thrilling. Sure a twisted romance novel like this may intrest a few, but it did nothing for me at all."
4,where is the sequel?,"My only criticism is early on in the book the reader discovers where the entire story is headed. Human hybrid goblin-like creatures were created by military science as super soldiers. They have increased strength and agility with the ability to transform out of human form at will. Science made them infertile but, evolution has other ideas about that. Many have escaped into the normal population. Their ultimate goal is to put mankind on the endangered list and become the dominant species. The story is centered around Slim, a young man with the ability to ""see"" through their human disguise. Thus, he takes on the burden of thwarting these creatures plans. I enjoyed the original idea of monsters that can only be seen by this boy with twilight eyes. If, Koontz can write more than one book about Odd Thomas and Chris Snow, why not Twilight Eyes II. The ending begs for another book to be written."
3,"Wordy. Very, very, very wordy...","An interesting storyline and characters you can care about, but Koontz seemed to use every adjective in the dictionary for this one story. I don't normally skim paragraphs in any books, but for this one I found myself doing it in each chapter. Just because you know fifty plus different words that describe a dark night, doesn't mean you need to use all of them!!! If you like overly descriptive prose, then this might not bother you, but to me it just seemed as if the author was showing off."
3,Classic Koontz,"The heroin, Slim Mackenzie, has Twilight Eyes. He can see things in people - at least everyone thinks they're people - that terrify him. After killing his Uncle, who was one of - them - he runs from the law and joins the Sombra Brothers Carnival. As he gains the carnies trust, they reveal that he is not imagining what he sees, and joins them in a war against the Goblins. These creatures, creations of an extinct civilization of man, plan to exterminate the human element of the earth and take it for themselves. Even his girlfriend Rya is working with them. Slim's plan is to infiltrate their operations bunker before they have a chance to start a nuclear war.Although not his finest work, if you are a Koontz fan, it is a must read. The only weakness of this book is the overzealous wordiness in some of the scenes.J. P. Landry, author of Hazard 666"
4,Elegant but egg sticks to its threads,"I like:Its elegant look and stainless steel body. Its very handy and robust.A very good product for the money I spent. Its worth more than that.I dislike:After slicing the egg, it sticks to its thread and makes it very difficult to clean.Overall: A nice product to buy if you clean it immediately after slicing."
4,Great film,Very good interpretation of A. Jolie. Keeps you expecting things will finish ok. It shows the city of Karachi and a diferent way of living. See it yourself
2,A mighty heart,"This movie was kinda long and drawn out(boring). Sorry I purchased it, might resell it. The only part of that movie that keeps poping up in my mind is when Daniel pearl was ask about 911. ""Why so many jews didn't show up for work that day when the twin towers were hit"". Why would the writer of this movie write a line such as this and put it in a movie? Is the writer truly trying to tell us something about the jews and 911?. Can jewish people be trusted? are they the true evils of this world, and the reason for the wars we face today?"
2,Unbearably Tedious,"I'm not going to go into much detail in reviewing this movie, so I'm going to make this brief. The true story of the death of Daniel Pearl is heartbreaking, but not necessarily a prime of example of terrific dramatic material for a movie. In fact, this movie is incredibly dull. It's got a lot of heart at the center and, as I said, the real story is heartbreaking...There's nothing really great about the film version though. Even Angelina Jolie (who's performance has been highly regarded in film reviews) isn't TERRIFIC here. She doesn't quite get under the skin of Mariane Pearl, Daniel's wife...Plus, she's sporting a fake French accent that fades in-and-out through the movie. Everyone behind the making of the film had good intentions, but the film is really incredibly uninteresting.GRADE: D"
1,May not work all MP3 Players,"I purchased one of these to go with my Creative Labs Zen. It died almost instantly and the reseller told me that it was because It only works with Ipods. That's the short version of the story.The longer version ends up with the people at Accessory Genie emailing me ""Learn to accept responsibility for your actions and quite blaming others. It may hurt to do so, but one has to look in the mirror at himself and look at his shortcomings and deal with them. "" I wanted to listen to my MP3 player in the car and instead I got a life lesson. Thanks Accossory Genie, I'm glad you set me straight."
5,History with some humor,I am a fifth grade teacher and thought this was a well written non-fiction book. It gave great details about the beginnings of this country and the key players. The author includes contributions made by women in history. I thought the novel was respectful with a dap of humor. The reading level would suit my class and I order each student a copy to read. I feel it is important for our young citizens to take an interest in the formation of this great nation. We need to find books that keep them interested. Elizabeth Levy's style is just right. Thank you.
2,Was worth a Try I Guess,After trying all sorts of remedies for removing oil from my granite countertops I saw pretty positive reviews for this product so I decided to try it. After putting up with the sort of sickening citrus smell and having things off countertop so this stuff could dry for 72 hours...I removed it and there was absolutely no difference--the oil remained as it had. I admit the stains had been there a while and maybe because of that it is more difficult. At any rate it was worth a try but very disappointed that I followed instructions exactly and ended up spending the money and the time for no results...if it had at least faded the stains it would not have been so disappointing.
5,Great Product,Great Product that does what it says it will do. I had a grease stain from some fat that got left on the granite for over 12 hours. I followed the directions and it worked.
1,Completely useless,"We have some grease stains on our marble floor tile and was hoping this product would help.To our amazment, it has NO effect whatsoever on the stain. I didn't even hope it would completely clean it up, was just hoping it would reduce the stain a little bit. Even that, it failed to do. There's no difference whatsoever that we can tell before and after treatment.Everything was done according to the manual, we endured two days of smelly odor as instructed, ended up absolutely nothing.Don't waste your money, hire a handy man and have the tile replaced."
4,StoneTech EX16,This product worked well and removed the oil stain on my granite counter - it did require 3 applications to get all the stain out.
1,Useless!!!,I don't know how it works on other people's granite. It does not work on mine at all. It is totally a waste of money. Don't buy it!!
1,does not work,"I tried this product according to the directions, on my granite counter tops, when i removed the dry product the granite looked the same. So i feel like i wasted my money.thanksvince santos"
4,A great defense of Premillennialism,"I read parts of this book and it aided me in a paper in seminary. I recently purchased a copy of it for my own use. I would not recommend reading this book from cover to cover, it no doubt is a great defense of premillennialism. Unlike books about Amillennialism, & Postmillennialism, this book was written by many different scholars showing the credibility of the scriptures and the defense of the premillennialism view. If you desire a far more simpler read then get the book Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond."
4,Ok,"This book is okay its really gory and kinda nasty with all the killing and stuff. When the evil doesn't kill Jason i thought that was the end but it wasn't! I really luv this book. its kinda freaky and scary though, cause the evil talks to her inside her head and stuff."
3,not as worth-reading as others in this series,"i felt that the other books in the ""fear street sagas"" series were better, namely 1 through 5. however when the story returns to the cheerleaders, i immediately become uninterested. some people may find this book more captivating than i, but i felt i was certainly able to put this one down."
5,Understated Guy - Incredible Book,"I had the fortune to meet Lt. Col. Ramsey when I was working as an intern at the rare book department of the Kansas State University Library in 1994. He donated a manuscript of the book to us and we had lunch. As I recall, he was one of those guys who just seemed, I don't know, 'cool'. He was quite old then and I remember thinking he seemed not at all like the other senior citizens I had met. Still quite sharp. I read the book before we shelved it and it was an amazing story that has stayed with me through the years. It's definitely a book worth making a movie out of. Oddly enough, I have met Filapinos who know who he is since then in my travels around the world!"
2,Sorry About That,Randy Jones is not the player I had been expecting. There are a lot better out there. Go to Savannah GA and hear the Howard Paul Trio to understand what jazz guitar can be.
3,"Half Boston, Half Something Else","Only about 5 songs on this album sound like Boston. The rest are a mix of Def Leppard, Green Day, and Carly Simon. I think all the songs on the album are very good, but I really really wanted a new Boston album that sounded like a Boston album. I only got half of one, and then a ""mix-tape"" with some other songs that are pretty good. I am therefore disappointed. The Boston sounding songs are great, and I want more of them! That full Boston sound with screaming guitars, super vocals, and flying keyboards is what I like about Boston. Leave the other stuff for a spin-off solo project!"
1,Why?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????,"Boston has left many of their old fans behind. We have to wait 8 years between albums, and each one shows the band losing the main focus even more. Boston used to be a heavy rock band. They put out one of the best heavy rock sounds of the mid 70's. They have since split up, put together several low quality reunion lineups, and sucked since '78. Don't get me wrong, I love this band. They just don't have their act together anymore. Really, you only need their first two records."
1,this is terrible,"Tom, if you want to make music, make music. If you want to save the world, save the world. But Tom, you obviously can't do both at the same time! This CD is terrible. And Kim, she may sing well, but help! She is not at all Boston. And half the songs are written by some new young guitarist? He may be talented, but what happened Tom, the trees in the forest not producing enough oxygen for your brain? I can't believe that one of the greatest bands of all time are having a 20 year old write their songs for them and a girl sing their songs for them."
1,"It's not Boston.....Scholz! For God sake, change the name!","Tom may as well change the name to 'Scholz and clan' cause the power rock of Boston is gone. Without Brad there's no point. I much prefer to spin a Return to Zero album than this CD. I never did like Fran Cosmo, even during his Orion days. I'd rather hear Brad sing than listen to Tom's artificial violins, the boy's working in a vacuum....still. Tom's no spring chicken, he's old, lost his creative edge. (Some say it was gone at Third Stage)"
1,Dissapointed and hurt,"THis is the worst album of Boston. Tom Sholtz in typical egotistic fails to perform. His drum proggramming is horrific. The sounds he uses for the drums are just a joke.This guy thinks that with his cheap home recording - will trick us to buy his goods.But this album doesn't even match the quality of 21st century. The old singer can not even be heard because of bad bad producing.I miss Brad's singing so much.Tom, stop acting like you know it all, just play the guitar and invite the old members to contribute like the old tumes.I am so disspointed at this solo Shultz album that I do not even listen to the old ones anymore. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE FOLKS."
3,"Outta touch, play what we like","This album has some incredible music on it - if you can get past the ramblings of some extremely dated hippy attitude. And the misplaced addition of a female singer. Which one of you told her she could join the band so you could spend time with her?Those of us who like Boston don't pick it up to hear their view on society. We want to hear classic rock. Sadly, this group thinks we want to be bombarded with politics.Thank goodness I can ignore all the environmental posturing on the inside booklet and thank goodness for CD Tracks so I can skip right by ""Corporate America"".It's just sad when an individual or group like this gets a little popularity or notoriety and thinks that we should listen to their ideas on anything.Play honest Rock. That is all we need from you."
5,Excelent,"I loved every song on this CD. My favorate is ""Corporate America"". Tom Scholz puts a lot of meaning into these songs."
2,What is this?,"This group should not be called Boston. Maybe Tom Scholz and friends. The songs are okay, at best and does not remind me of Boston in any way."
3,Corporate AM is too different to satisfy my boston craving,"Tom Scholz is one of my favorites, and it's great to hear Delp back on vocals (at least partially). I loved Third Stage, and I keep hoping I'll hear something of that caliber once again, they haven't came close to that album with either Walk ON or Corporate America. This album is disturbing enough because there is a female voice in there and it just doesn't work. I will say this....Boston doesn't have enough of the sharp guitar rifs like at the begining of ""I need your Love"". I'd love to hear more of this...and with Delp doing all vocals (not a fan of the Fran dude). Another thing...where there used to be hand clapping is now something that just doesn't sound real. If I had Scholz' abilities, I would have done it very differently. Thing is....NOBODY equals Scholz."
1,IT'S ...!!,"That's all I have to say to explain the album. IT'S ...!! BOSTON has a flute in one of their songs...HUH? BOSTON has a female lead singer...HUH? It's just funny how the rich can complain about the rich being rich (Corporate America). Congrat's Tom, it took 7 years to create ...! This album does not sound anything like the old Boston, it doesn't even sound like a new Boston."
3,Deliciously BAD,"If you're looking for good movies, go elsewhere. If you're looking for a great recreation of the ""grindhouse"" experience, then look no further.""Malibu High"" is deliciously bad, with just the right amount of corniness and kookyness that it will instantly become a guilty pleasure.""Trip with the Teacher"" fails where ""Malibu High"" succeeds. It is almost a good movie, meaning that with a little tweaking it could have been a solid idea for a mainstream hit. It was too bad to be good, and too good to have the cult level of goodness that ""Malibu High"" has.The trailers are great, (most notably, ""The Stepmother"") and all in all this DVD set makes for a great experience. Skip it though if you're looking for an Oscar winning masterpiece. You're buying the experience here, not the movies."
1,piece of garbage,"I bought this watch at Target for $14.99. I thought it was a good buy. I didn't really want to spend too much on a watch (only needed something for work). Well, I got what I paid for. Within three weeks of having it I noticed every time I would wash my hands (which is a lot because I work in a hospital setting), condensation would finds its way underneath so that I could not read the time until the moisture dried up. Totally surprised me, I've never had a watch do this. It still works, but its not worth taking off every time I think it might get wet (supposed to be water proof). Not worth the good buy. I guess it pays to go a little more expensive."
4,Better story but....,"I really like the story, I like the focus on God, but the illustrations were not as beautiful as some of the versions of this book that I've seen."
1,"Pretty, Disney-esque book but not the classic","Though the pretty pictures remind me of a Disney movie, don't be fooled into thinking this is the classic THE TALE OF THREE TREES. That's another book altogether and this is a not-so-subtle imitation."
3,Not as good as I remembered.,"The writing in this book just didn't live up to the quality of some of the better ones. The choices are haphazard and the endings are lame. The idea is nice (being lost at night in a strange forest filled with trolls, packs of fire ants, and, of course, werewolves) but is let down by the clumsy storytelling. I'd give it a go just to experience the (actually cool) story, but don't expect high-quality writing."
5,Great music!,My brother sister and I listened to Songs from the Loft constantly when we were little. We had it on tape and we would listen nonstop in the car-it was a great variety of fun Christian music to listen to.
1,Is it a bird? Is is a plane? No it is a ...,I bought this small fan for our guest room which is also quite a small room. I paid to have it installed and because of the high noise level paid to have it taken out later that week. I can only say that this fan is a piece of junk - very little air movement but especially the loud sound - much like a train off in the distance. It could be heard in the adjoining bedroom as well. [...] [...]
4,Ramble on,"An Excellent summation of an excellent group. Real History here. The New Lost City Ramblers didn't just make music and history, they invited them along on the journey. This DVD captures this dynamic folk group at its' essence. With the recent passing of Mike Seeger this film is vital for anyone interested in the history of American Music and in learning how to collect and pass on the treasures of our culture. Please purchase this film and do yourself a favor."
5,Vale Mike Seeger,"This video of the New lost City Ramblers is s fitting tribute to the late Mike Seeger, Musician, Musicologist and fine human being.This DVD is a must-have for all devotees of traditional old-time music, collected and presented by 4 excellent multi-instrumentalists."
4,Well researched and interesting medical story,"I read the The Cry and the Covenant when I was around 14 years old and it is one of the most affecting books I've ever read. This new book on Ignac Semmelweis is well-researched and it adds greater detail to the sad story of politics, conservatism, and pride which caused countless unnecessary and tragic deaths of young women and children. Given that medical mistakes are all too common, this should be required reading for anyone in the medical field!"
3,#63 Light Golden Brown,"My hair is naturally a shade of light brown. I got highlights for a few years but I decided to go back to my natural color. I was tired of having the roots and tips of my hair different shades (my roots went past my ears) so I resorted to doing it myself with Garnier Nutrisse. My hair color is even now. Since it is a ""golden"" shade my hair had an a lot of new red tones in it. A few people told me that it was kind of like a light shade of auburn. It was fun for awhile. It fades pretty fast (which most of us expect) :). My intent was to darken my hair a little bit, but six or seven weeks have past and I would say my hair is lighter than when I started. I think it has to do with the shade that I picked. I'm not really into having so much red in my hair and I would prefer having it darker. If I were to use nutrisse again I would probably use #50 or #51. I think my next hair coloring venture will involve Garnier Herbashine (maybe #500) though. We'll see how that goes."
5,Good,This product met my expectations. The design is also good .The product is a light weight. Expect to buy more .
3,Not my favorite strings,"These strings are decent but not great, and given the price - I'd expect them to be great. They last really well, albeit not as well as Elixirs. The trebles are smooth and clear, but the bass strings are too bright (IMO) and don't have the kind of definition I'd look for. I tried these on my Taylor K24CE, and was very disappointed in the tone. After they died, I went back to using Elixir Phosphor Bronze Nanoweb strings (*not* the polywebs, which sound too mellow to me), and couldn't be happier."
2,Charlie Bone and the Castle of Mirrors,"The story certainly had plenty of action and some interesting characters, but much of it was not very developed. There were too many threads to the plot, making the reader wonder why certain things were even mentioned if they weren't going to be integral."
2,YUK,"Ok 1st of off, it's not really that good. The movie wasn't good, and the book isn't any better. It's a lame movie that got a bunch of lamers on the web all excited to become a hacker. Please...need I say more"
3,MOP REFILL,REFILL WAS OK. IT WAS NOT THE ONE I NEEDED SO I DON'T THINK IT WAS DESCRIBED WELL ENOUGH. CAN'T SAY HOW IT PREFORMED.
2,Too coarse,"While I like the idea of the product, the execution is a bit off. The sharpening stone is too coarse and due to its shape, is more likely to wear down your darts than sharpen them."
3,A Helpful Tract,"Although this book is extremely brief, it contains nuggets of information helpful to a beginning youth worker. There is not enough content to fill 80 pages, so format does the filling. Still, it will likely give the novice youth worker AT LEAST one or two very practical ideas."
3,"Decent walking, but not slip resistant","I bought these shoes hoping they could be used at work, but unfortunately they don't provide the heel support to comfortably get through a 8 hour shift. Also, they aren't slip resistant. They look nice, and they LOOK functional, but unfortunately they don't follow through."
4,My boys love the books but...,"The books are great, my 4 and 7 year old boys both love them. However, the quality of the construction of the books is poor. When you do the flip-o-rama pages, the pages fall out. The pages are being held together with scotch tape."
3,"great story, Pages fall out!!!","This would be a great book if it wouldn't fall apart. After sitting with it just a little bit and trying to do the flip pages the page just fell out. The story is wonderful and very intertaining for a 4 to 7 year old learning to read, or needing to get interested in reading. I have never had a book that the pages just fall out from the glue.HMMMM...I would have given it one star, if it weren't for the fact the story and the cartoon illustration and the flip pages are all wonderful."
4,Amending previous review,"I just reviewed this sellar and gave them a poor rating, myapologies. I was looking at the worng book (we had ordered 3 copies). This sellar sent a nice copy of the book. They were a little slower than the other three.."
1,I'm Soooooooo Confused!!!!!,"Black Ice was by far one of the most difficult and boring books I've ever read. I choose this book because it was and autobiography about a young African American girl and I thought in some way I could relate. First of all, the book starts off completely slow and it stays that way throughout the whole book. It doesn't have any parts that are interesting or keep your attention. One other thing I didn't like was the fact that the words she used were dull and hard to understand. There were too many characters and she jumped back and forth between them throughout the entire story, so you never know whom she's talking about or what their purpose is in the story. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone under the age of 21 and I'd never read it again."
2,Antiquated,"While this book has a lot of good information, it is out dated, sometimes wildly so. It continually hampers itself with discussions of 16-bit Windows which, while still in use in 1995/1996, was clearly on the way out, contrary to what the writers assert in the first chapter. Having said that, it is well written and the book deserves a second edition, dedicated to Winsock2 with nary a word on 16-bit windows."
5,Complete coverage yet highly readable,Initially provides a sound introduction to the concepts of networking - the 7-layer OSI model etc . Then describes where WinSock fits in. Builds up to a complete FTP client (complete source included). Then goes through the ENTIRE WinSock 1.1 spec.A very useful chapter on Do's and Don'ts of WinSock.Brief guide to what's new in WinSock 2.0Overall - clear and complete explanations of the whole shebang.
1,Is This the Best There Is?,"I am a very experienced C/C++ software engineer currently taking a community college class on WinSock networking programming. I'm used to dealing with difficult text books. However this is one of the worst I have ever wrestled with.There are no exercises in the book. All their examples are long; no short examples of code to clarify any topic. Their way of explaining most subjects seems to me to be unclear, their wording such that I have to read a paragraph several times to figure out what they are trying to say. Finally and especially, their explanation of the key topic of socket states is flat-out awful. I have had a little experience dealing tangentially with socket states on my last project, and I still came away from this chapter confused and with my head spinning.I hope that there are better WinSock books than this out there!"
1,The worst book,"I'd not recommend to read this book - waste of time. First 13 chapters contain tons of unimportant information about specifications, history and general words about how networking is great. Although these chapters contained a bit of example code - this didn't work at all. Since the 13th chapter there is a terrible example of a full scale FTP client that is totally unclear. At that point I closed the book. My friend had the same book, he went further - threw the book away.In fact I learned basics of Windows sockets from the greatest book of Petzold ""Programming Windows"", where every code was working and then ported my knowledge of UNIX networking to Windows."
2,Quite a bit less than what I was expecting,"I've read quite a few of Ms Wrights other books, mainly the offerings of her take on the Star Trek universe and was expecting a bit more when I read this book. Took me a while to get through it, especially as it started to plod after the first chapter. I picked it up again a few days after becoming bored with the plot in my initial reading, but even after steeling myself knowing what I had read, the plot really didn't get much better throughout.All in all I was quite disappointed with this book, I had expected better given my previous experiences with the author's work."
2,Dissapointing,"I am a huge fan of Cleggs and always heard this one is one of his best. Unfortunately, that rumor didn't prove to me to be true.The story held promise, in a way - its fun to read about witches from older times and some of the characters, like Maddie, are easy to latch on to. For the bad side of things, other characters weren't given the focus they deserved, the story was muddled and poorly paced too much of the time, and a lot of it was just plain confusing.The style is a bit too distant and literary, and some of the action in certain scenes was uneven. The ending was a slight saving grace, being strong with it's impact. If you're a fan of Clegg, give this one a try, but if you're a virgin of his work, try another by him instead."
3,Not my fav of his stuff,"I have several of Votolato's albums, and there is one song on this one that I like, but for the most part this is my least favorite comparing to White Daisy, Suicide Medicine, and some other one I have"
3,Not Just Eliza,"The way this collection is presented by Amazon one might think it is an Eliza Gilkyson CD or that at least Eliza composed all of the songs. Neither is true, although she does sing 5 of her songs, all of which are all good ones. I don't like to deduct stars because of the way a product is marketed, but this is just a little much!"
5,Perfect,"Saved about $35 over the dealer cost. Perfect fit. Arrived quickly, packaged well. EAST to install. Very secure. I thought I might just live with the passenger mirror out---not."
5,Kids Just Love it,"All the good things you've heard about this book are true. My fifteen-month-old daughter loves books and has about 25, and while she's normally content to just sit and leaf through the pages, once or twice a day she'll bring a book to me and put it in my hand, obviously asking me to read it to her. Moo Baa La La La is ALWAYS the first book she picks up. She just loves it and wants me to read it to her two or three times in a row (good thing it's a short book!) This book obviously has universal appeal that all kids love."
2,Rhinoceroses snort and snuff! You got to be kidding me!,"I read this book to my baby on and off and every time I trip at the big ol' Rhinoceroses! Come on Ms. Boynton, your readers can hardly say goo goo and moo moo why such a big word.It could have been water buffalos or plane old ""rhinos"" or for that matter ""big hippos"""
3,A Funny Introduction to Joke Telling for Young Toddlers,"Another funny Boynton book, this one is about the noises different animals make. Introducing humor for very young children, she surprises the reader by having singing pigs say ""La la la"" instead of ""oink."" On the following page she suggests that the reader correct those pigs. This is a nice book for young toddlers, but the joke is simple enough that it won't last long into toddlerhood, and won't interest older siblings. Better to enjoy it once, then return it to the library."
5,Wonderful Book!,"My daughter has loved this book for many months. She is now 22 months old. She turns the pages herself and also says the sounds and ""no, no"" when the pigs say la, la, la. Very cute. I have all the words memorized so she can turn the pages as I recite it. We have may books-this is one of our favorites!"
3,A little disappointing,"While this a great book for those kids who love rhyming, it is too short and there is not really a connection throughout the book. My son does not love it like other Boynton books such as the Goin to Bed Book."
5,Easy to Memorize so it goes anywhere!,"This should be the first book any child owns. I thank the Lord everyday that my sister gave it to us. It is easy to memorize so when our Nettie is bored, in the car or in the bath, Mommy and Daddy just have to start with, ""The cow says Mooooo...."". The fussing stops. We are playing Santa tonight to get her more of the Boynton books. They are her favorites!!"
5,"Nothing Beats ""La La""","My son loves this book so much I'm buying it again. Our first book finally gave out after being read a thousand times and now he now picks up every book to see if it's his ""La La"" book. This is the first book that got him interested in reading!"
5,Greatest Nintendo Game Ever Made,"This is the greatest nintendo game ever made. This game will keep you playing for months and months. If you buy it you will not be dissapointed with what you got. If you have the 64 and don't have this game, go out and buy it right now. The 64 is truely not a 64 without this game. The levels are the most increadable thing and are so fasinating! buy this game now!!!"
5,Awesome Game its Mario come on,I think this is the best Mario game they have made. I haven't played any new ones but so far this is th best its so much fun to just run around and be silly in the game.
3,Good for Beginners,"This game is getting old. If you are not very experienced you should try it, because it is not very hard. It is fun."
5,The Big Conflict,"I really liked the game, it was awsome because the game took me a year to beat. It has 20 or more levels BUT there are six activities to do in each level. Bowser is trying to take over Peache's(Toadstool)castle and it is up to Me(Mario) to save her. In the first two levels of Bowser he wasn't very challenging. But the third time you try to beat him he is hard to beat.I like the way Mario can use wing cap, metal cap, and invisisble cap to help him. You have to collect a total of 120 stars. You won't get all of them just by completing activities in the levels.this game had me playing it for a long time. I got this game for my birthday 3 years ago and enjoyed it since. If you're a mario fan buy this game.One thing that bother's me about the game is I only have 119 stars, How do I get the next star?"
5,Yeah!,"I realize that normally, when a review gets a perfect score from some random person, it's shouldn't be trusted. But this review is perfectly legitemate. This game is, in my opinion, one of the greatest games created, along with SM World and Halo: CE. For it's time, it has beautiful graphics. The controls are PERFECT, although the camera is rather pitiful. But once again, compared to other games in during it's time, gameplay is nearly perfect. Levels can be replayed several times to gather stars, and after that, you'll want to return to break a record or something. The music never lets down; it's filled with a whole bunch of great 'tunes', as the kids say today. So if you have an N64, a bunch of free time and don't already have this... you know what to do."
2,If you don't have a game shark don't buy this game,"Let me just say that i think mario 64 is a okay game as far as gameplay and graphics goes but, every level get's harder and harder it's so hard it would take you months to beat it and by the time you do you would be white as a sheet from staying inside all the time and 50% of your muscles would atrophy. also the ending really sucks it ends by princess toadstool saying let's make a cake for mario then it's over so don't waste your time with this game."
5,code of deception is amazing!!!!!,"Code of diception is amazing! Minamized durty languge, though there is some. I truly recomend it! There is amazing tallent in Ted. It is like he is a yung Rowling in computer fiction. This is the best book after Harry Potter! It is also violent. Mite as well dump your TV. the first few words are, allready, exciding,A deadly game..... ( refrence to proluge )"
5,An essential cookbook,I also have used this book since the early 80's. The mixes are great and are such a time saver. One of the best recipes for pancakes is so easy to make.
4,good cook book,I previously owned this book. I found it and bought it for my daughter to help her save money by making her own mixes.
3,Fair condition,"Timely receipt, but book in fair to poor condition and it cost more than original, which surprised me."
2,"Despite the controversy, this book is rather dull.","Everyone loves a book when it's banned by a government or, better yet, when an intelligence agency opposes its publication. However, I'm sorry to report that is book is dull. There are a few interesting stories, but it was barely worth the 88 cents I paid for a used copy."
5,Great gift,"This book makes a great gift. It's small and inexpensive and filled with hundreds of inspiring quotations that are useful in everyday life. Reading a few quotes a day is sure to encourage just about anyone. It's pages are packed with practical wisdom that is truly uplifting. I've given copies of Open Your Mind, Open Your Life to many coworkers and friends to rave reviews."
2,Features didn't work...,"The device is plug and go but unfortunately, the mute and call end buttons on the top do not work."
4,Good ecommerce book,Very good book for those looking for a book that deals with people not just on cyber space. Everybody has to be there own judge but I thought it was well done for my need's. Thank you
1,WORST ROCK FESTIVAL FILM EVER!,"I could go on and on, but briefly - if you are a filmmaker and you spend 100 times more time in your film showing gatecrashers throwing rocks at a tin wall than you do Miles Davis fronting one of the greatest jazz bands of all time, or Jim Morrison or Jimi Hendrix giving their last performances, than you are an idiot. This film is an agony to watch for any true music lover. Also, one last word folks (and this is true for Altamont too), don't judge the motives of the entire love and peace generation by the results of an incompetently organized rock event. As Seth and Amy would say, ""Really!"""
3,Where is the full version of Ten Years After?,"Really dissapointed! I bought this movie exclusively to watch Ten Years After's song I Can't Keep from Cryin' Sometimes, and what a big surprise, just 5 minutes of the original 19 minutes version."
5,Spiritually Uplifting!,"This book is a candid, honest, inspiring and fascinating story of one person's journey of self discovery. A synergy of the spiritual and the intellectual; a fascinating read that will move you!"
1,This man is Evil,"A Rabbi who has links to Far Right groups in Europe?!Who calls Muslims ""Dogs""at Far Right Rallies, Absolutely disgusting!Wait a moment, I suppose I'm not concentrating on the Surfing.....I'll have review Adolf Hitlers ""Surf & Genocide-Big Waves, Mass Graves"" next-A rather difficult character I know-but also a great Surfer!"
5,Highly Recommend,"This book has a thorough and understandable explanation of tonal values. Though some of the art work is good, some not outstanding, I would think that most artists would buy a book for the knowledge over the pictures. I had an understanding before I bought the book, but the author's explanations made everything about ""value"" more clear to me. I would recommend it to anyone. It is now a permanent part of my art library."
4,Good read,Fred Rosen did a good job writing this book. It moves along nicely. I like that he keeps suprising you with new information thru out the book. If you like true crime you will like this book!!
1,Stale and unoriginal,Overtly racist and homophobic humor not even delivered with any tact. Their humor serves as a painful reminder why the rest of the country views the south as backward and inbred.
2,Great if you like gloomy music,"I really didn't like this DVD. The music is very slow, and very depressing, and very uninteresting. I also don't believe that Mr. Gilmour's voice has held up very well. I think he chose a couple of songs which are clearly out of his vocal range such as the one with the French title. (However, he did sing well on about 5 of the selections.)The guitar work wasn't as bad, but his playing wasn't very expressive. It was almost like a dry run through and lacked emotion. I like much of his past work, but this DVD just doesn't do his talent justice. He is capable of much better."
2,uh?,"I dunno what's more disturbing... To watch Dave's fat old face...Or listening this fat douche bag play Floyd songs...It's cool to hear an acoustic version of some floyd songs... once in a while... But this dvd gets very , very old , very soon."
4,Worth it for one song alone.,....and that song is Comfortably Numb with Bob Geldof singing. Stunning. It is good to see Gilmour off the gravy train and doing music under his own name. It's a lot more honest than the stuff he was doing in the 80s and early 90s.
2,Good musicianship as ever but dissappointing,"While Dave Gilmour is as excellent as ever the concert is not very engaging. Maybe it's me that just doesn't like acoustic versions of classic rock but it just didn't do anything for me. God knows who the guy was that did the intro to comfortably numb - even I could sing better than that - maybe it was his Dad :-)Overall, not bad but lots of the emotion in the music wasn't there for me."
2,Erm... No,"I'm a big Gilmour fan - love his solo output... think Pink Floyd without Waters was just fine... think his vocals and guitar was what made classic Pink Floyd ""classic""...But, this DVD was sort of sad to watch. The acoustic setting makes it all to easy to see that Gilmour has gone way past his prime. He can no longer sing, and his guitar playing - without effects - is mediocre at best.I was absoutely certain that I would love this DVD when I bought it, but by the 6th song or so I was ready to turn if off. I don't understand all the 5-star reviews... search out some of the lower reviews and you'll see they echo(es) my sentiment.BTW, for a better taste of Floyd from the 21st century, check out Roger Waters' ""In the Flesh"". Even though I generally side with Gilmour in the Gilmour/Waters feuds, Water's DVD is infinitely more polished and entertaining than this one..."
5,Rollei,Beautiful vintage book on Rollei Photography. There is tons of information on the camera and many different diagrams to refer to. Love it!
1,"You asked me to write a review, BUT.....",that would be a little difficult since I never got the book. Still waiting. I'm about to cancel payment and file a complaint.
3,Not what I expected,"I thought this would do a better job of cleaning. Looked good when finished but didn't last, made it worse to get dirt off."
2,"Looks funny, but isn't","I generally love bizarre surrealistic stories full of odd characters, but only if they have fun.This novel's protagonist, Mary Jane Shady, has no fun at all when she returns home toUncertain, Texas after 20 years in show business, chiefly as Miss Butter Cup in a series of peanutbutter commercials. Mary Jane suffers continual delusions due to emotionaltrauma imposed by a high school boyfriend. Not to be disgustinglyspecific (although the author was), but the trauma involves sex and a germanshepard. I didn't laugh at all, folks. The eccentricies of the people of Uncertain arecompelling, but ultimately don't matter because Mary Jane is so sunken inmisery that current events fail to reach her. I'm glad I checked this one out of thelibrary rather than paying good money for it."
5,Great Video for kids and adults,"Awesome! I highly, highly recommend this series to anyone with a hearing infant who wants to help your baby communicate easier and earlier. Just make sure you watch it with your infant so you know what signs they are showing you! I was amazed at how quickly my baby and I could communicate with these signs. After only watching it once my [...]could already start some of the signs. She is less fussy because she can tell us what she wants. It is wonderful. Well worth your money, buy it!"
3,Interesting reading but....,Dr. Lee is well-known and respected and in this book seems to single-handedly solve crimes that the rest of those in the business just cannot seem to figure out. I think this book is more interesting as a fun read to those outside the profession than inside.
3,Don`t be fool by the cover,Better watch the song list before buying this one its the Fifth different cover of the same show I encounter. The show is excellent all her songs are there plus pleasant surprises. On My copy the only complaint I could Make was the lack of sound. You`ll have to turn up the volume to the max to get some depth and sound. Her voice is beautiful and the 3 stars is too keep buyers aware of duplicating something you already have.So choose the one with the best price.
5,Awesome Album & Hilarious Review by Ray Davies!!!,"This is the most consistently brilliant Who album ever!!! Sure Tommy may have great songs, but many of them were filler and short little ditties. The Who's Next showed the true genious of Townshend and the boys. From start to finish, not a single throwaway track here. A must listen for any music fan!To tell you all the truth, I haven't even seen the documentary (although i will purchase it within the next few minutes thanks to amazon). The real reason I write this little scrap is that I thought Ray Davies' review was ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS!!! The way he completely dissed Andrew from Switzerland was classic and it had me rolling on the floor for about 10 minutes! Props to Ray ( and Andrew's mom) for the comic relief and true understanding of what makes a good documentary.And props to the Who for the inspiring music.peace."
1,"Nice album, shame about the documentary","this documentary doesn not have a narrator, nor does it have any explainatory sequences at all. there are even interviews with people who'll the viewer never gets to the name of! who's next is one of the most complex and interesting rock albums of all time, don't waste you money on this half hearted attempt to cash in on the brilliance of the who."
2,Not interesting,My son got this one for christmas from a relative.. so far he has barely touched it.. thinking i should have returned it.. will see if he gets more use out of it when i start rotating toys around
1,The Best Toys Ever!,your toy looks wonderful all you toys do i love them i always get like (...) worth of your toys each year even for easter my mom ordered me thet cloth bunny name thing its wonder thank you so much
1,"Miserable, destructive copy protection","I love this game. The samurai horror movie milieu is exotic and lots of fun; the character control is fabulous; the story line is interesting; and game play is not monotonous. That said, I've given it a one because the copy protection scheme physically damaged at least two CD drives. A third one may have been damaged; I can't tell because the computer itself is damaged in some way that makes installing the OS impossible. There is no question that the copy protection on this game was responsible. It's a bit like being out on a date with the most beautiful girl in the world and discovering that she's a brain-dead racist. Just tidy up and walk away."
3,Too many common adventures,"I purchased this book because I wanted to escape the world of lousy planet and was looking for a guidebook that could give me a fresh, different perspective to this world metropolis. However, I was disapponted by the content, with many of the ""adventures"" being very common tourist destinations in Tokyo, like Asakusa, Yokohama, Tsukiji and the morning rush at Shinjuku station, covered by almost any guidebook. And given that this book can never be your only guidebook to Tokyo (there are no accomodation listings or basic travel information, and few maps), I was expecting more unique destinations.On the other hand, some of the adventures in this book are so expensive or esoteric, only the elite few will ever experience them, like enjoying Koh-do or watching the art of Japanese archery. That being said, I did enjoy some of the adventures, most notably the walk through old Tokyo. But if given the chance again, I would skip this book."
2,Waste of Time,"I'm really glad I watched this disaster for FREE on HBO, at least I did not waste my money. Horrible script and constant flashbacks that really did not allow the mostly talented actors to touch the audience. Absolutely no chemistry between the long lost lovers - no surprise here, ""Harris"" had the personality of a tree and the young Vanessa Redgrave (Claire Danes) was not much better. Emotions seem to be forced. The only thing that touched me had nothing to do with the story - just seeing the lovely Natasha Richardson and knowing of her untimely death. It felt like a role reversal to real life - how very sad."
2,"Morning, Noon and...","Don't be fooled by the stellar cast: ""Evening"" is an endless B-movie bore from start to finish. There's enough plot for three films -- and with so many false endings you may feel as if you've been watching for that long -- but none of it means anything. The pace is glacial, the script trite, the characters whiny. And it's all presented as an extremely ""important"" exploration of love, loss and the human condition. Hogwash. This is an ""Art"" film that's so self-consciously ""artsy"" I wanted to run screaming from the theater. (And I LIKE art films.) Two stars for the costumes, art direction and the ever-reliable pro performances of Eileen Atkins, Meryl Streep and Toni Collette; none of which is enough to justify this stultifying waste of film."
2,So long...,This movie was ridiculously slow moving. They almost had the movie because it does have a nice plot but it just wasn't a good movie. I was looking for a better romance movie and instead was just left disappointed with the middle and end.I wouldn't recommend it
3,Evening,"Power-packed with superstar actresses, the concept is good, the individual acting is up to par yet something is missing in the story line and directing. It ends up being a trite chick-flick."
3,well Meryl Streep was wonderful as always but,"can one spell ponderous?So many of the themes felt so dated, but perhaps that was the intention of the writers."
3,"""Wow, that was just not very good.""","I wish I had more good things to say about 'Evening' - I love Claire Danes (who does her own singing here), Patrick Wilson and Toni Collette. And it's hard to take your eyes off of Mamie Gummer, who aces the role of playing a young Meryl Streep (for starters, Meryl is her Mom; but that's unfair: Ms. Gummer is good in her own right).But the movie itself...blech. It's a trudge. I think Roger Ebert said it best in his review: ""There are few things more depressing than a weeper that doesn't make you weep."" Exactly. As soon as the film ended, my wife (usually a fan of this ilk) looked at me and said ""Wow, that was just not very good.""Audiences are voting with their feet...this one is struggling to hit $10M, even with its 977 screen opening."
4,Its a story about living,I think that the films we admire today have some sort of huge plot that need to be fulfilled that a task or goal has to be done. This is not that kind of movie. This movie takes a segment of the life thats full of drama and then shows us that if we survive and continue that tomorrow isnt that far of a stretch. Its jsut about life and regret
4,very comfortable,I have put in many miles on these shoes. They still have great cushion comfort on the balls of my feet as well as the heels. I have many walking shoes but these are my favorites.
4,Great Camera,It really worked great for me!! I know people that doesnt like it because its too small and you cant fit it in a tripod...In my case I love it because I just use it when I go to parties and concerts and its so small and great to carry. Regarding to the picture quality i think I got a great camera.... Its beautiful...I get great pictures!!
3,mediocre pic quality,"I just want to say that I agree with the reviewer, C. Caroll. To the reviewer who inferred that C. Caroll did not read the manual correctly, you are wrong. Indeed the photos are full 5MP, but if you zoom in on them, and you will see a definite lack of clarity, and elements of compression. They almost look like impressionist paintings when you zoom in. I bought this camera for the size and the low-light capabilities, and it met my expectations in that regard. But I am disappointed with the picture quality."
5,great camera- super easy to use,"I've had several digital cameras in the last 10 years and this is my favorite by far. Very very easy to use, great small size and takes excellent pictures. I lost this one and decided to replace it with the exact same camera!"
2,"Great Camera, Bad Company","Here's the Good News:I have had many cameras in my life, digital and film , and I have found the Z1 to be my favorite. The camera is very user friendly and the pictures are sharp with great color. My previous camera was a Minolta Dimage 7($800) and I found that this camera's photo quality was just as good. The best feature of the camera is the fact that it is sturdy and compact enough to carry with you daily. Owning this camera made taking pictures a daily part of my life.Here's the Bad News:Recently my camera broke and when I tried to contact Fuji to get a replacement or a repair, the service was terrible. Their website is very difficult to navigate and offers very little support.Summary:Great camera as long as it doesn't break. It's easier to pay someone to fix it than actually get Fuji to repair it."
1,Nice Fabric but not a Boppy,We went to the store to purchase a nursing pillow and came across this Nuzzle/Basic Comfort thing. We were told we had to get a Boppy Pillow but my husband talked me into purchasing this product instead. Big Mistake! The fabric was nice but when I actually started using the product I found that the darn thing kept moving around on me and my baby never quite got comfortable. At first I thought it was me but after borrowing a Boppy Pillow from a friend I discovered it was the Nuzzel and not me. You are much better off with a Boppy Pillow.
5,phyisiology cliff's notes,"I love this book, it's good for brief review any time I want to go over the little things that one forgets after school's over. It's much simpler in the bed than a huge hardcover textbook."
5,No more tears at bedtime!,"Send you child to bed laughing for a change, with this wonderful, fun-filled, silly, bedtime book! Great for baby sitters, too! Author/Illustrator"
1,"author thinks exercise before bed makes sense, and credits the 'oddity' of it's 'best selling' status","I LOVE the 'Barnyard Dance' and have been on the lookout for more Boynton that is also rhythmic and silly without some poignant message of some sort (see the poor left-out hippo). I like the Going to Bed Book - except for the exercise part (just like all other reviewers here, even the 5-start ones).I thought - you know, maybe the author would consider deleting those two pages from this otherwise perfect book! Well - apparently her and her -sister? sister-in-law? daughter? mother?...someone with the same last name - are so convinced of their perfection that she (the unknown family member) very kindly responded that there would be no such possibility since 'oddly, after all these years, the book continues to be a best-seller'.Wow - I applaud her success, but will definitely not contribute to it any longer - here ends my search for rhythmic Boynton!"
4,Works Out,"I got this primarily for our 20mo old. She's got ever-changing tastes, but did show interest. Our 3yo will stand by and pay attention while it is read, but (much like myself) cannot wrap her head around working out before bedtime, lol!"
2,An OK book,This book seems like it was written in about 10 minutes. She has much better books that are fun to read including Pajama Time- which is hundred times better than this one.
2,"Good theme, but not very well executed.","We've had this book since my daughter was very young. She was never very into it, but she absolutely loves other books.My husband and I also find it a little weird that they exercise after they put on their pajamas, but whatever...."
1,Strange Bedtime Routine,"I really like this author's books. Moo Baa La La La is one of my daughter's favorites. However, I threw this one out. The idea of exercising AFTER bath is illogical to me and not a concept I want to promote with my child. Bath-time signals an end to vigorous activities and a time for calm restful activities. I really don't think she thought this one through well enough."
3,Nice and simple book,"Bought this book for my three year old hoping it had a creative way to get my son off to bed! In that sense the book did not serve my purpose, it did not make it ""fun"" to go to bed. However, it is a well illustrated book, simple to read and short."
5,Great for Nephew,"I have already read over this, and believe it to be great for my nephew (age 2+) and can already see him and his baby sister sharing it as a bed time story for years to come."
5,great bedtime book,Nigthly bedtime stories are must in our house. this is a nice addition to our growing children's book colllection.The illustrations are beautiful and the writing makes me chuckle.I like Sandra Boyntons books!
5,Don't listen to Negative reviews - wonderful book!,"This is a wonderful little book. The rhymes are witty and silly and a joy to read. The kids loved it. 10 years later I can still recite them from memory. If you are going for ""realistic"" then this is not your book. But, seriously?"
3,"Ok, not great.","Not a favorite board book in my house. Nor is it a favorite bedtime book. It has some great linesbut the pages don't really jibe together for us. It's just kinda a ""meh"" book in our collection."
2,Not my favorite,"I have a bunch of her books but this one is my least favorite. It just doesn't make sense. The animals take a bath, put on their pj's and then go upstairs to exercise. I know it's a kids book but it's kind of annoying. Maybe I'd feel differently if I was read this story as a child."
1,Missing Parts!,"I received my tool box missing two stationary trays, deep molded tray and the j bolt hardware. Manufacturer told me those items cost additonal and the j bolts are for another model, they called the ""challenger"" series. I contacted both Amazon and Manufacturer to correct the misleading information. Buyer Beware! It's typical manufacturers like this one that provide false information to get you to buy their product, then try to play the ""It's Amazon's fault, not ours"" game. The Manufacturer blamed Amazon for it's product description and did not want to honor the items is was supposed to come with. I give 1 star for lying and just not admitting the mistake and also for trying to make me pay extra for items that was supposed to be included."
4,Good werewolf movie,"After an attack,a New York newswoman goes to a resort to recover.Turns out the resort is for werewolves.Her attacker was one of the members of the community she and her husband visit during her recovery.Good movie!"
3,THE HOWLING!,"I would give The Howling 2 1/2 stars out of 4. A reason for this is because it was very silly, had terrible special effects, but the characters were complex and it does try, so I do not hate it."
3,The Howling.,"The Howling is the BEST of All the Howling Movies. and the most watchable(along with part 3 in a weird way).Although In my Opinion the Best Werewolf movie of all time is An American Werewolf In London which eclipsed this when it first came out. However, I would much rather watch this than say The ""New"" Wolfman 2010. what a snooze that was.this is an 80's along with Werewolf in London."
4,good horror,"This film is what a horror film should be. There is not the emphasis on blood and guts, but rather on suspense, and the wolf-man in this one is one of the most menacing, and down-right-scarry in recent memory."
4,The Classic Badass Wolf Flick,"This is one of my favorite Werewolf films.The Howling is a milestone in special effects,nothing came close to it at the time until American Werewolf in London was released.I saw this film when I was very young, and it gave me nightmares.After seeing it to the point I was'nt as scared of it anymore,I was completely mezmorized by the makeup effects.The Howling is a classic in it's own right,and the story is simple enough,but you really want to see this film for ""the scare"" and the ""Werewolves"".Not many good Werewolf films out there being made.Lots of Vampire movies,cause they are easier to make&make believable.Well worth watching and adding to your dvd collection."
3,Transformation,"I realize this was a groundbreaking werewolf movie that influenced every one that followed, etc... but its innovations have been copied soo many times they creak now, and the ""Esalen"" setting seems to reek of the 70s (okay, early 80s - whatsa diff?). Still has that great transformation scene, but pretty disappointing to watch now..."
4,"See this before you see ""An American Werwolf in London""","Very well made Werwolf movie, but not the eternal Hightlight I expected it to be. I overall like this movie, but I think ""An American Werwolf in London"" was a little better. The special Effects are great in both movies, but this one had too much non-hooowling scenes like the pointless werwolf-sex scene. Also the story just doesn't grip me. Our Heroine isn't much of a likeable person, actually I just hoped she would get mangeled by some of the hairy fellows. Some scenes really drip from Scaryness and will keep you on the edge of your seat, others are rather silly. Overall a good movie. See this and then ""A.A.W.I.L."" and you have seen the only two Werwolf movies worth seeing! ( I also like Wolfman - The Howling 3 but I am alone with my opinion, although I think it is funny, beautiful and somehow has a very human message )"
3,Understandable,I now understand why my body works like it does. This book explains very well how hormones and sugars effect people differently.
4,"Excellent case, good price - VERY HEAVY","I purchased this CD case for my fiance since he has a massive CD collection and his current binder was ripping at the seams. He absolutely loves this case. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because although it holds 360 CDs, it really will only SHOW 180 cds. You have to stack the other 180 behind the first 180. It makes it difficult to see which CD is behind there for easy accessibility, even if you alphabetize your CDs like my fiance does. Next time I'll get an even bigger case.Otherwise, the quality is excellent. It is VERY heavy though! Be warned!"
5,Definetly worth getting!,"You will need this book in order to accomplish all of your missions and save all of the hostages! Also includes real SWAT team photos and back stories of how SWAT was conceived! So load up soldier and take down the terrorists and save the hostages and be home in time for supper! Remember, your an ex-Semper Fi! and now your an elite SWAT leader part of the LAPD SWAT team! Go out there and do your stuff! Ten-Hut!"
4,THEY WILL HOLD A LOAD,"All in all I'm satisfied with these straps, but I did have a bit of a problem when I went to cinch down my load...the ratchet tended to slip. This may have been my fault and if that turns out to be the case I'll try to remember to come back and edit my review. (I've only used them once and that's really not giving them much of a chance)."
3,Didn't Stand the Endurance Test,"I have the model before this one - the 650S. Hardly had any use on it before my husband passed away. When the grandchildren came to visit I thought, ""Great, they can watch DVDs in this little player in the car on the way back home."" WRONG. The battery was DEAD and wouldn't charge. As a matter of fact, the battery light would not come on that it was even trying to charge.However, the unit still works with AC or with DC in the cigarette lighter. But that was not my intention. I first thought about sending it with one granddaughter who came to visit earlier and who would be flying home. ""What a great idea to have her take it on the plane and have her mother mail it back to me."" But I'm glad I didn't since it would not have worked for her.Cute? Yes. Great size? Yes. Great product? No. Sorry, folks, thumbs down on this one if you want portability.Gail Gupton, Author: 'The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment', and 'Seekers of Truth'."
2,Not enough mystery,"I also thought this book was not one of Anne Perry's best. I love both series, Monk and Pitt, but this one was boring. Caroline took up way to much of the novel. If it was a side story, it might have work better, but it overtook the whole book and definitely overshadowed the mystery, which seemed to take a minor role in the plot. If Perry's book are to continue in this fashion, I will probably cease to read them."
3,Half Moon Winks Out,"I am a fan of Anne Perry and enjoy her because she does not have to beat me bloddy with the trials and tribulations of her characters [After all they are Victorians]. This one, however, was even a bit too ""on the top"" for me. The end was abrupt and motivations seemed an afterthought. The case is solved too quickly, in my opinion, and it was far too difficult to follow."
2,Endless Bummer,"Unfortunately this album does not live up to the Bomp history. The Warlocks first Cd was great, psych-rock but this album seems more like a pardoy of 60's music. Something has definitely changed here. There is some interesting guitar work but the overall groove is lacking. I could see one of these songs on That 70's Show or an old Lenny Kravitz album. If you like very typical and cliched 60's rock then check this album out!"
5,Cris from Ashley River Creative Arts Elementary,The book I read was Amelia & Eleanor Go for a Ride. The illustrations were black and white. Eleanor was the president's wife. Amelia was a pilot. The illustrator had put good details in his drawings. I like this book because it was historical.
3,Parent/Baby Time Toy,"I actually agree with both previous reviewers. Both were accurate in their assessment of the toy. But with that said, I believe this toy is great for play with parent and child. It's true that it takes too much force to pull, pound or slide anything on this toy for a child. But with a parent helping I think it's lots of fun. I myself, don't think I have every been able to hit the nails with the hammer and get anything out of them. Instead I just press them and have my son do it as well. Bottom line, if you are looking for a ""play alone"" toy, this isn't it. If you are looking for a ""let's play together"" toy, this is worth the money."
3,Limited Fun,"I got this for our 9 month old boy. He doesn't play with it much except to turn it over and pat it's bottom. He listens to the music and watches the lights when I push on the nails and pull the measuring tape, but that's it. He teethes on the hammer a bit. I think the toy is loud and annoying with it's little laughs, but I guess a kid wouldn't mind. There wasn't a sound adjustment I could find. Overall, I wish I had just bought a plain old-fashioned wooden peg bench he could hammer on. Maybe he will get more out of it later on."
3,Not very fun,"This one doesn't get played with much at our house because my son just gets frustrated with it. It's hard for little kids to push down or hammer down the shapes, it's not just a little tap. Also the slider on the ruler always gets stuck and he gets mad about that. The measuring tape is actually the only fun part about this. And the voice that says ""Peek-a-boo"" or ""I see you"" is really annoying to me. I wouldn't recommend this."
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this for my 22 month old son for easter. When I opened it the only thing it did was light up...I put fresh batteries in and same thing, just lights no sound whatsoever! I was hoping to see his face light up in the morning, now we have to take it back."
4,More interesting than it appears,"We bought this toy (with several other Fisher Price toys) when my daughter was around 6 months old (about 8 months ago),and she really seems to be enjoying it more now than before.She likes pressing the little animals and hearing them either count or make exclamations (depending on the mode), but her favorite is pulling the measuring tape and hearing the songs it sings (either abcs or the toolbox song).It comes with a little hammer for using to hit the animal's heads, which I didn't like (who needs to teach their kids to start hitting?), but she likes taking the hammer off and playing with it seperately (she pushes down the animals with her hands).I think it is a harder toy for babies because it takes some effort to push down the animals (and even pulling the tape is not easy), but would be enjoyable for you to play with them.This was a good addition to our toy collection."
3,"great toy, a littel pricey","Maybe I have bought so many toys for my son (now 14 months) that i have blocked out how much I actually paid, but I do not recall paying 43 dollars as the list price is. I bought it for my son when he was around 9 months old and it has been a hit or miss favorite. I'd say on average he plays with it a few times a week. As he gets older, I think it will turn into a toy we will play with often for learning purposes, but the pounding and blinking lights don't draw his attention enough to be a favorite. Personally, the tune the toy makes when you pull on the tape measure is actually my favorite of all his toys that sing:)UPDATE- Looking back thru my order history, i found i did not purchase this toy via amazon, but rather from Walmart online and it was only 18 dollars. Maybe Amazon has the wrong list price?"
1,dont even bother,"i got this toy for my daughters first birthday, and i took it back before i gave it too her!! When i got home and tried it out i discovered that when you pull the tape measure and its supposed to sing the ABCs it only goes to P and then stops!it might be different when you take it out of the box, but i didnt want to take any chances."
3,Penquin Edition: Cuts in the Narrative?,"I have not read this Penquin edition, but it says in a footnote; ""There are some cuts in the text, but it follows the main narrative"". Does anyone know how much was left out? Get back to me. Thank You--Hey everybody, guess what? I just did some checking; and Oxford World Classics has published two editions: Books 31-40, and 41-45. And they do emphasize that they are complete, as opposed, to say, the incomplete one volume Penquin edition. For people who have Latin. How long would it take to read all the surviving Books of Livy in the original? Again, get back to me. Thank You"
5,Durell is on a mission to stop a fiendish madman and his global plans,"An excellent Sam Durell adventure pitting the Cajun against Dr Sinn and his evil legions of killers. Fast-paced, peopled with interesting characters, some rather brutal murders, kidnappings, hired killers, a renegade CIA killer and torture scenes. Durell, the CIA's premier K Section agent, is faced with danger, twists and turns and several bodies pile up before he is able to confront the evil Dr Sinn in a remote monestery in Mexico where the doctor's killers are blended in with a group of passive worshipping monks. Very good story, one of the better ones IMHO. I give it five .38 Specials."
1,Poor Quality & Bad Customer Service,"I ordered this item and I received it in a timely matter except when I actually got it, the marker was broken. The eraser had broken off and it was in the bottom of the bag and the tip of marker was non-existent. So I called ""Team Express"" and wanted to return it. They said they would email the ""return label"" in 1-3 business days. So I waited and waited...and waited. I called back 3 days later and told them that I never got the email, and then they said I would have it by the end of the day. Next day rolls around, never received the email. That morning I called AGAIN... still haven't received it. I just want them to take it back so I can get my money back! This is ridiculous, and I will never be ordering from this company again. They have the worst customer service."
4,Justin Robertson - Revtone,"Justin Robertson finally releases under his own name, and the album, REVTONE, seems to presage the whole electroclash phenomenon. But Robertson transcends any such limitations: ""The Brightest Thing"" is a stellar a house track, deep and luscious. Many of the vocal tracks (""Everpresent,"" ""Crawling to You"" ) have that affectless 80s vocal style, but coupled with the long harmonic tones and the funky electro beats, they escape drudgery. ""Ready to Depart"" is more on the disco side, but ""Love Movement"" returns you immediately to the 80s synth pleasures. For those more interested in darker work, ""My Dark Places"" will hit the spot. For the most part, none of the tracks are as distinctive as ""The Brightest Thing"" until the very last track, ""Everyday Haunting,"" which starts with a jazzy drum riff and eases into some lovely off-kilter vibraphone melodies."
4,another Nuphonic gem,"A perfect album before going out, or for your own party. Robertson has created a shiny happy album of shimmering disco delights, with the odd breaks'n'beats and cinematic flourishes. One of the few albums I've recently purchased that I've stuck on repeat. After years of mixing and various 12"" and eps, Robertson has produced a worthy debut album."
2,Disappointing Results,"A client recommended this kit so the podcasts I produced for them would match their recordings.Sadly, installing the drivers under XP was an annoying process, and the volume of the recording was too low, requiring software amplification (not great).It worked better under Vista, but under Linux, the volume was so faint as to be unusable.The mic stand is awful and cheap, and while the microphone is OK, the overall impression I get from this kit is pure underwhelm. If I had it to do over, I'd get one of the USB condenser mics (for simplicity)."
2,"Nice sound, but NOT made for podcasters","Pros: Good price, good quality sound, easy to set up.Cons: Wow, HUGE con here: This device cannot record from the stereo mix. As a podcaster this is a disaster. You cannot record a Skype conversation, for example (woops, no co-hosting!). What a ridiculous feature to leave out for something called a ""Podcast Factory."" Save your money for something else, folks."
2,"Looks great, very uncomfortable","The shoe looks great, but is one of the most uncomfortable I've worn.Leather sole is really hard and there is almost no cushioning inside. The heel started wearing out in a few weeks time.These shoes seem to run a 1/2 size larger than marked."
2,to plain,i had orderd this watch timex1440 sport watch allthough its ok i found it to be just a plain watch..the only thing i thought was good about the watch was that it was easy to read if u had a problem seeing then this is the watch for you i would not order this watch for myself again but for the price it was a good deal
4,Very good!,"I played it through a few times, and am now passing it down to my son for his birthday. It's lots of fun and challenging. Highly recommended for long-term fun."
3,Pretty good,"Book shipped pretty quickly (I think I received it in less than a week?). I can't remember what the description of the book was when I purchased it, but it was in fairly decent condition when I received it, just some tears on the front/back cover (which I believe was listed in the description). Several clusters of pages fell out as I was reading it though, I guess the glue wasn't standing the test of time, and both covers immediately fell off upon use. I had to glue/tape a lot of the book back together. As I said- not sure to what degree the damage was described in the listing, so I can't say if I was warned or not."
4,"its okay, but still good!","dont get me wrong about this, i mean i love r. l. stines books and everything, i just like the second one the best and whats up w/ nora, i mean where is she going that makes her so desperate to write the story b/4 they 'take her away'? i mean are they going to take her away to another place, or are they going to kill her, or *shurgs* i dont know. anyway, i still think that all 3 of them are still good."
2,One Rubber Duckie,Your child will quickly recognize his/her Seseame Street friends but will soon tire of the unimaginative and drab photos.
5,I love it,I used to wear it long time ago. Then I couldn't find it in any store so I was very happy when I found it with you. Deliciuos.
1,Very Poor Quality,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!! I can not believe someone would have the nerve to sell this video. I have never posted a review on any site, but was prompted to after watching less than 2 minutes of this dvd. Not worth sending it back. Threw it away -"
2,He almost had me believing this story,"until the part where he got the bigfoot in his car and drove it two hundred miles away and a day and a half later it was back~! He really blew the tale when he claimed to have somehow loaded the dead bigfoot up (hoisting it alone would be difficult enough) into a car, and drove it to where he cut the body into pieces before burying. I mean if you like I almost did, believed the story up to that point how could he just so callously dismember this creature that he apparently loved? I personally couldn't even do that to a dog I loved! It would be too disturbing and also unnecessary. Especially, the part where he whacked off its head with an ax no less? Why?? Had he an ounce of sense he would have photographed the body and then arranged anonomously through the Smithsonian or some reputable scientifc organization to donate the body for every one to share. This story is just that. An entertaining yarn but with parts that are disturbing as if a Stephan King novel."
3,Great story that runs out of gas,"Quinnell's books rarely disappoint in the action thriller genre. However, with this one, he seems to have lost interest in the story with 40 pages to go. The denouement is over much too quickly.That said, the rest of the book is vintage Quinnell. He has written far better books (The Mahdi is excellent, Man On Fire and The Perfect Kill are very good), but he does the 'tough guy out to take out the bad guys by whatever means necessary' as well as anyone.If you plan to read The Blue Ring, be sure to read Man on Fire and The Perfect Kill first. The adopted son who plays such a predominant role in this book will make no sense if you have not at least read The Perfect Kill first."
3,"What Creasy does best, revenge","I have all 5 books written by Quinnell with Greasy as the main character. I have to agree with the first two reviews that although this book is typical Greasy wanting vengence, it left me a little flat compaired to Man on Fire (MonF)and The Perfect Kill (PK). There are quite a few passages that have been take from MonF and PK as if Quinnell just wanted to fill in parts of this book. Some scenes very graphic and others very erotic.All said and done, I suggest that the reader read MonF and PK both of which will introduce some of the characters in this book."
3,Not bad for the money,"Not a bad dvd for some GR techniques.However, it is far from comprehesive and some of the East European instructers could use some voice-overs."
3,Great for beginners,"I am a big fan of Rodney Yee's instruction. If you're just starting out, he gives some of the most detailed and helpful instruction on video, and I highly recommend this video series for new yogis. Intermediate/advanced yogis might not get much out of it. I do the first 45 mins of power yoga as my recovery workout after a long run, and enjoy it. Yoga for athletes is not challenging and throughout the videos, most of the postures will not be new to experienced practitioners."
1,Bad DVD,The yoga video was good but the DVD did not work after only a few uses. Would not recommend and would like a refund.
2,everything and nothing,".Book about everything in bridge design that gives nothing usable..briefly explained topics,poor quality of graphics and photos,lack of important details and discussion about them etc.. are only some of remarks,...theoretic and to general....worth mentioning is section regarding seismic design...find another book on bridge design"
1,Watch out for poor quality books from OUP,"My copy of this much-praised book from Oxford University Press is very disappointing. It is print-on-demand and there was not enough ink in the printer. What a disappointment from a publisher that for years has provided beautiful, high-quality books. OUP is not ready for new technology. Better to look for a used copy than buy new from them POD."
3,Missed Opportunity,"Are you interested in comparing Les Paul and Stratocaster guitars? Then you will find this video interesting if it will play on your DVD player. I had no problem on my laptop, but the disk skipped and shuttered severly on three different relatively new DVD players. Amazon replaced what I thought was a defective disk only to be presented with the identical issues. So buyer beware on that possibility. Overall it was enjoyable if somewhat short IMO. More footage from some of the more prominent players would have been nice. Not really an entertainment piece, but interesting."
3,Vic and Sade,"The quality of the recording is sometimes inaudible and staticky. Not every episode has its own track number.I enjoy the show, but expected better quality."
2,Its too repetitive and boring,"My husband and I started doing Bible study at home, this was the first book we got. We wanted to learn more about our marriage as well as learning more about God's way and becoming closer to Him. This book is WAY too repetitive for me, it seems that some of the weeks are repeated later, and mainly things that you have learned from the time you were younger, like Adam and Eve and how the woman should be at home and the man at work.. I am 29 and hubby is 39 and we have been married going on 8 years. If I am ever asked this will not be a recommended reading. We are trying Gary Chapman next. We aren't having huge issues, but there are always issues in anything in life, and we want to learn to cope with them better and communicate with one another better."
1,"Simplistic, boring, ""complementarian""","Yet another ""bible study"" that purports to tell us how to build good marriages but doesn't live up to its promise. Repetitive, boring, fill-in-the-blank type lessons may be good for the very young or those not familiar with the bible. Also, be warned that this book preaches the traditional ""wives obey husbands"" jargon that marginalizes and minimizes women."
2,Heavy and lackluster,"Like the previous reviewer, I too, a newcomer to Columbia faculty, was curious about the history of this great ivy league university -- how President Butler dominated Columbia for 50 years, the difficult Eisenhower presidency, and the student riots of the late 1960s -- and bought McCaughey's massive history sight unseen. Big mistake. Talk about a boring pedantic tome. Fortunately, I've found a better book written by a far superior writer: ""Eisenhower at Columbia,"" by Travis Beal Jacobs. Now there's a page turner, with much background and history of Columbia in living color. Now if only Jacobs will write a sequel....."
2,"Perhaps okay for older kids, NOT for those just learning opposites.","This book is a pretty standard book of opposites, the illustrations are just okay, not the adorable wonder that some reviewers would have you believe they are.The only thing that makes this book truly awful, in my opinion, is that the words are not laid out from left to right. For example, the word small, is written around the small bird, and the word tall is written up and down, both on the same page, with other words that go from left to right. This is confusing for small children who are learning to read and need the stability of being able to read always from left to right."
3,JUST OK...,THIS BOOK ISNT REALLY THAT GREAT. IT WAS A GREAT PRICE ON AMAZON BUT A BORING BOOK MY DAUGHTER AND SHE WASNT THAT INTERESTED IN IT. JUST NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN YOUR AVERAGE OPPOSITES BOOK..I REALLY HAVE ENJOYED SO MANY OTHER SANDRA BOYNTON BOOKS THAT I WAS SURE I WOULD LIKE THIS ONE TOO BUT NOT THE CASE THIS TIME.
3,I'd rather hear them than see them,"I'm a mild Indigo Girls fan. I like their complex vocal harmonies and guitar playing and many of their songs. This video didn't enhance my image of them. First of all, I didn't think the concert included many of their best songs and secondly their stage presence wasn't all that impressive. There's such a thing after all of being too unglamorous. They could have combed their hair for the occasion. I would also have enjoyed more between songs chatter to get a better idea of their personalities on stage. So, in conclusion, this is an OK video, but I'd rather listen to the Indigo Girls than see them."
3,No WORDS,"I didn't pay attention when I bought this, but there are no graphics or written lyrics. They give you two cds, one with the lyrics that you're advised to listen to and ""learn the words"" and then the non-vocal karaoke cd.Just be aware before you buy. The songs are great otherwise."
3,Ehh,"I purchased this to remove hard water stains, as I've been using the Method granite cleaner for general cleaning. There was some information out there saying that this product would remove soap scum and hard water stains. I can say it does not remove the hard water stains. It does leave behind a faint residue film I can see on my tan brown granite under the right light conditions. My guess is that it is the fluorinated acrylic copolymer/sealer. So now I just use a razor blade, elbow grease and Method Granite Cleaner on occasion.From http://www.eskandaristone.com/care_guide.htmBath and Other Wet AreasPeriodic use of Revitalizer(tm) will remove any soap scum or hard water deposits that may have formed. In the bath, or other wet areas, using a squeegee after each use can minimize soap scum and hard water deposit buildup."
5,Wonderful Product,"I have used this product and the polish in the same line for 6 years. The results have been excellent. The granite is cleaned perfectly and always shines. It also has a lovely, fresh aroma."
1,They Turned pop and went flop.,"I'm a huge 'tones fan! I've been skankin' to 'em ever since Adonai made its first hit. But if you loved Strikeback or the other early stuff, you're going to hate this cd. It will be a huge disappointment. If you've paid attention, you've noticed that they have progressively become more melodic, but they always had one or two songs that kept it hard core. There would be songs where they rapped instead of sang. Well it's all singing now... This cd is something that may make you sway side to side, but it definitely isn't the hard hitting 'tones that I love. For now, I'll stick with the old school stuff and keep the hard stuff playing. Maybe ska is just dead..."
5,Supertones back to basics!!,"Wow, what an awsome CD. The Tones get back to basics with their 5th Studio LP Hi-Fi Revival. They get your toes tapping and your fingers snapping with songs like ""Superfly"" and the radio friendly ""Brand New Thing"".They also slow it up a bit with an awsome worship type song ""Hold on to Jesus"". MoJo's vocals are better than ever and Ethans guitar licks [are great], Tony pumps up the bass and Chief and Dan will ""Blow"" you away, making this the best Supertons LP to date. Catch the boys live on the ""See Spot Rock"" Tour this spring. All in all I think Jesus would be proud. Rock on Supertones!!"
2,Feels like Dollar Store quality,"I've had the butter dish for a week or two. Here are my initial impressions:Most importantly, it claims to be stoneware, but it feels like that cheap, chippy stuff you get at Kohl's or the Dollar Store. I'm expecting it to chip the first time someone sets the lid down too hard. I have other stoneware dishes that feel much more solid and long lasting. For $20, I expected better quality. I'll try to remember to update this review in a few months and say whether it has held up or not.Other than that, I like the cheerful color, and it is very large, as others have mentioned."
2,Another disappointment from NY,"""Nas presents..."" I really believed this cd could get NY to shine after a stagnation of good rap music from the East Coast the last years. It's only two good songs, the rest is average or under. Some of the beats is not hip hop at all. I wonder why some of the producers try to make some southside style beats for this Nashawn kid who really have potential. For good NY hiphop, check out 'underground classic' The Longshots - Hunger Music. Best CD from New York the past 5 years. 4 real."
5,GLORY DENIED,"Of all the books I have read in my lifetime, none has moved me more then the story of Captain Floyd James Thompson!! He is without doubt one of America's greatest and most loyal and dedicated American's I have ever read about. As a Viet Nam Veteran I would venture to say that even the most Hardend Combat Veteran would be humbled by the story of Capt Floyd James Thompson!! An incredible story of an individual's will to not only survive in the most inhumane conditions but to maintaine the constant will to stay loyal and committed to his Flag and Country! After reading this book you will find that every day problems no matter how grave they may seem will seem miniescule!""Glory Denied"" is a befitting title for the story of Captain Floyd James Thompson and his Family as he and they deserved so much more from our Country then was given! He will be surely missed, but never forgotten!C L Chamberlin"
4,Note about the author,"The reviewer from California is way off base. Lydia Adamson is the pseudonym of Franklin B. (Frank) King, so I would say that HE is well-qualified to write as a male character in the first person."
1,DON'T YOU DARE!!,"I bought one of these pieces of crap for $199.00 and it wasn't even worth that. I thought I'd save some cash but the TV burned out after 5 months repairs would be more than I spent on it in te first place so now I need a new tv. Even when it worked the quality wasn't very good. It was a little screwed up in the bottom corner, the whole screen had a wierd look to it like you where looking through a a screen door and the s-video looked terrible. Now that I have looked online and read all the horror stories I should of gotten a sony or something. Bleeeaaach!"
4,North Dallas Forty; The Bible of Football Fiction,"NDF, written by former Dallas Cowboy, Peter Gent is one week in the life of Phil Elliot, professional football player. The work is a piece of fiction, but firmly planted in the reality of Gent's pro-football career.Gent unfolds his story with graphic violence, graphic sex and absolute savage humor. Any sports fan who ever wondered what professional football/sports was really like behind the TV cameras, should read this novel. Memorable characters that parallel real-life football stars, and a great pace make this book one of my favorites. To quote one critic of the book, ""...Gent isn't a great football player who just happened to be a talented writer, but he's a great writer who just happened to play football. North Dallas Forty is a must-read."""
4,Not just a great local band!,"If you haven't had the chance to see The Drexlers play in and around Atlanta, then you should watch for the opportunity. A great sound, like early Pretenders, and a fun stage presence. This album is a small sampling, but worth having in an eclectic collection."
1,GRAB HANDS AND RUN!,"Jeez! I hated this book! I could not stay focussed or even remember what happened because it was soooo boring! It's the worst book I ever read! I had to read it for school, that's the only reason I did read it. Now, I have a test on the book, and I'm probably going to do bad, because I don't know what happened! It was just way to boring for me and I hated it so much that i couldn't remember anything that happened. NOW IM GONNA FAIL CUZ THIS STUPID BOOK!"
4,Chronicles of Er-Da: Book One,"These are short fantasy fiction stories with interesting plot twists. The author obviously likes his subject matter, and he has lots of different kinds of things going on. There isn't much dialogue, and the stories read more like old narrations form here on earth. But they're easy reading, and are good stories to read for fun. Good for teens and students. Enjoy!"
5,Bosh O2 senser & wrench,This was an OUTSTANDING BUY!!!!The O2 sensor were OEM spec. Fit was perfect.The wrench was a MUST HAVE to complete the job correctly.In my case the entire job took less then 45 min.That's to replace BOTH Sensor's...Front & Rear.
4,"Maybe a minor Steinbeck, but still a very good book","Do not be misled by the fact that Steinbeck have written better books, this is indeed a good one.It is extremely well written and you will go through it fully enjoying the story and the characters. While this book is only a satire, Steinbeck does a very good job in studying the nature of man when politics, power and government are concerned. Even if the author attitude may seem different from his first novels, and while he may seem more cynical and resigned, he is still a very keen observer of a world that has drastically changed from the one he used to describe.The only (minor) flaw of this book is that sometimes Steinbeck try to go back to his typical epic and evocative style, which seems a bit out of place in a satire such this."
2,Not your typical Steinbeck,"A light political satire, written within a few years of (and so sounding at times very much like) ""The Mouse That Roared."" The government of France collapses yet again; this time somehow it's the Monarchists that come into power. They find the rightful heir of the Carolingian line and crown him Pippin IV. His teenage daughter dates the son of the Egg King of Petaluma, California. Political philosophy is discussed. The ending is a bit less upbeat than ""Mouse"" (this *is* John Steinbeck, after all), but nobody dies or anything.Not at all typical Steinbeck: that may or may not be a Good Thing, depending on your tastes. I found it amusing to read once (and short!), but zero replay value."
4,This is a very good book.,"The writing is excellent, the sex scenes highly erotic without falling into the trap of needing to be more and more outre in order to avoid repetition, the characters (mostly) believable and sympathetic.I would have been happier with it if it didn't bring in semi-divine intervention in order to accomplish what doesn't, truly, require divine intervention. Had the main character learned to shed her inhibitions without the aid of a ""guardian angel"" ghost of a former call girl, and had the overly cutesy good and bad angels (""Angela"" and ""Lucy"" -- please!!!) been left out, this would have been a five-star story. As it is, it was still interesting, but not as good as it could have been."
5,Pleasant Surprise,"I bought this soap for my boyfriend. When I first opened the box, the smell was so strong I thought he wouldn't even be willing to try it. To my surprise he did, and he loved it. It has a really fresh, clean smell."
4,Smooth-As always,"Great CD. There are 2 songs on there I had always heard Mangione play on the fluglehorn but on this compilation, they are vocals. Those songs are, the land of make believe and the children of sanchez. That was a disappointment. But all in all, great cd. I love Chuck Mangione."
1,They were so close to changing my opinion of them.......,"This song was so catchy, this song had meaningful, pure lyrics I could relate to....I was SO close to liking them.....but the [...]cover of this single proved to me they're still the same immature retards I've hated all along. You guys blew it."
1,1 star for 1 star,"This movie was quite an inaccurate version of Cleopatra, perhaps it was intentional. The 1 star is for Timothy Dalton and only him! His performance as Julius Caesar is fantastic. Leonor Varela who plays Cleopatra seemed at the beginning of the movie to be lacking tremendously in the acting department. To my great relief she made some progress later in the movie. She is beautiful but needs a lot of work if she is to be respected. Billy Zane was okay as Mark Antony, perhaps if his character's script was of more substance he would have done a much better job! Apart from the fantastic costumes and Timothy Dalton, this movie deserves just a C."
1,Turgid,"Boring, plastic acting. Considering some of the actors involved, I really would have expected better. It must have been an easy pay day.. It's fairly obvious reading the other reviews that the Billy Zane/Timothy Dalton fanclubs have been on the prowl as well."
5,"Spectacular ,stunning performances that inspired.",This film was awesome for those who have great passion for this ancient time in history.The cast was spectacular the performances stunned and inspired the audience.
3,A diversion: Nothing more; Nothing less,"...Timothy Dalton did give an excellant portrayal of Julius Caesar and did his best with the script he had to work from. Billy Zane was better than adequate, but suspect strongly that the women viewers enjoyed his portrayal more than the male viewers did. That's okay, because I enjoyed watching Leonor more than I imagine most women did. LOL I do think she's blamed for a poor performance when the fault was quite likely more with the script than her acting. She's no Elizabeth Taylor or Claudette Colbert, but I thought she was adequate for a TV portrayal.I give this three stars because it didn't strike me as a BAD movie. And for those really devoted to different versions of Cleopatra's life will want it. There's enough sex and violence to titilate those looking for that.However, I believe that most viewers will find either the Elizabeth Taylor or Claudette Colbert versions more worthwhile."
4,Surprisingly good.,"The acting at times in this movie was overly dramatic and perhaps had a cliche look at royalty and power due to that. I'm not a history buff so I don't know too much about how historically accurate it is, but I thought that it was pretty good overall. Once you get used to Leonor Valera's dramatic Cleopatra, the movie is enjoyable. What I was really in awe of was the setting/props and costume. They were unbelievable beautiful!"
3,Okay but a bit trashy NOT a documentary,Just to make one thing clear this was not a documentary it was a film made purely for entetainment. No buddy critized Gone With the Wind for leaving out a few of Scareltts children. I would not watch this if I wanted historical info on Cleopatra but for a few hours of enjoyment why not some of it is true.
4,"It was ok, but some things were left out","The movie is very good. Wonderful acting, good story, esc.. But they left out some things that happened and changed some. Antony wasn't wounded in battle before he died, he killed himsef. And Cleopatra had two children with Antony. Also, her first child was killed by Octavius shortly before she killed herself. But dispite those flaws, it was still a good movie."
2,Not a bad movie for a really boring sunday afternoon,"The sights of Egypt were people. The costumes were believeable and nicely done. The music was touching. However, the story itself was really botched. I am a fan of Cleopatra's. I generally can not even compare it to former movies done about this group of historical figures. To the director, please stop trying to change history. It's really sucks when you try to improve on the orginial. The acting wasn't two bad by the men but as for the lead female. She lost me."
4,"The book is better, as usual","I've seen the movie several times, and while Billy Zane did a wonderful job and the basic idea got across, the novel by George is by far superior. If you liked the movie, you'll love the book, and if you hated the movie, the book will surely be your favorite, as it is mine."
5,"I am a Goddess...I am immortal, daughter of Isis...","I really LOVED this movie! True it's not historically correct but who cares?!? When I watch a movie such as this, it's for entertainment. I am a huge Cleopatra fan. I've read almost every book about her and seen every movie about her. When I watched the movie I NEVER expected them to do it right. It's hollywood! Don't expect much of them EVER! I also admit the acting wasn't all too great either but everyone needs to remember that's partially the directors fault too. He thought it was good enough and he could of had it changed too. From the low budget they had for this movie I thought it was excellent! Everytime I watch it I get taken away to a different time and place and secretly wish I could be like her. That I could be her! Oh....if only it could be. If only there were people out there like Marc Antony to take you away....God I love that movie! Fell free, any of you to email me so we can chat about this enchanting movie!!"
2,She just cannot act.,"Hi,This movie is bad. Well, actually, as said before the sets and costumes are good, but Leonor Varela, who plays Cleopatra, quite simply CANNOT act...not even if her life depended on it. She might look nice but every time she said something I felt like ""oh...not again""...instead of spending all that money on the sets, they should have gotten a better lead and thought a little more about the script. Billy Zane was good though...which earned it a second star."
3,Only one drawback,"The game is just as addicting as the others in the series. With the new characters/creatures/and magic spells it is a fun challenge. However, if you enjoy using cheat codes you will not be able to use them with this version. An email from 3DO stated ""the cheat codes were removed from the Complete Edition of the Heroes III game. This was a Development Team decision."""
2,All white people must be evil...,"If you want a book that tells you how all white people are secretly racist and want to protect thier ""white supremacy"" then this is the book for you. Nothing more then a list of how whitie is keeping the poor minorities down with sources that share the same feeling. Do not expect to find any actual debate."
1,garbage,Should have read the reviews first - saw it on sale at Office Depot for $20. I wanted it for the ability to convert DVD to different formats such as mp4 or wmv. Does not work at all - error message pops up every time I tried to convert and the program shuts down. Do not waste your time on this piece of carp!
3,"Spotty performance, but it worked well enough","Not as simple as it claims to be thanks to a strange user interface that keeps all the choices invisible unless you hover your mouse over them. I've only used the iPod-conversion feature, and I'd guess it works 60% of the time. Much better on movies than TV shows. Once I had made iPod copies of half a dozen of my favorite DVDs for watching on the go, I figured the program had paid for itself, so I'm not upset now when it freezes on some shows, throws off the audio-video sync on others, and so on. I aleady got my money's worth."
1,"Warning Will Robinson, Stay Away from 123",I just purchased 123 Gold and I still have yet to get this P.O.S. (Piece of Software to be nice) to work. It appears it is a hit and miss on which computers it will work on. Even with all the suggested work arounds from the delayed emails you get from 123 prove to be ineffective. I give it two thumbs down with a shovel to start digging with.I am tired of 123's run arounds and consider my investment a loss. Save your money and go buy some cotton candy at the fair. At least you will have a little enjoyment and forgo all the frustration. (However I do have to admit Fido now has a new Frisbee to play with.)
3,Good for really young,"This is a good toy for a baby under 1, because all they have to be able to do it sit up. Once they figure out how it works, and as they get older, they don't spend as much time with it, though. My 15 month-old will push the button once and then go on to something else."
4,Fun but for older babies like 9 months plus,"My son loves this toys, the only problem is that, it's not that stable, and the gumball would knot over and hit his head most of the times when he pull on it. My son enjoys pulling on the handle and scream went the ball is released! Great toy."
4,confidence builder!,"My son recieved this when he was 5 months old. The balls are wonderful - just the right size! The Gumball lights and sounds are soft and appealing to both of us. The knob also turns to reveal little gumball pictures. Right away, he was able to put the balls in the container. It seemed to be one of the few toys at the time he could master at his skill level. When he turned a year old, he was putting the balls up top, pressing on the lever, and smiling when the balls come twirling down. He was so thrilled to be doing it all by himself! Now at 17 months, there are a little more challenging activites to choose from but it was defentily a hit in his earlier months! Excellent Cause N' Effect toy!"
5,LOVES IT,"I gave this toy to my son a year ago when he was about 9 months old. He immediately loved it and now a year later, he still loves it. Good quality and will last a while. Definitely worth the purchase price."
1,Finger injury risk!,I bought this toy because it looked like a lot of fun and it had won a few baby awards. I gave it to my 7 month old and she was very happy playing with it until her little finger became trapped in the yellow twisting piece on the front. She was not seriously injured but she was still hurt and very upset. I would not recommend this product unless Fisher Price closes the opens behind the yellow twisting piece.
2,"Great, but no storage for balls","The idea is great, the toy is sturdy and the balls are very durable. However, there is no place to store the balls when play time is over. Now I have these balls all over the place. I find one in every room. And when my daughter wants to play, I have to go hunting for the balls. Definately needs to be re-designed to allow for storage."
4,Very bright and colorful,"My only complaint is that it is rather loud - not the music, but the balls themselves rolling down. My 5-month old loves lights and music, and although she can't push down the handle herself - she grins and giggles which is what I was looking for!"
3,its okay,"not great, not awful. decently constucted. use by three year old not good bc the pieces are difficult to grasp"
1,Not worth $4.50,I paid $4.50 + $2.95 shipping for this collection and i would say this collection is probably worth no more than $1.00 total with shipping. The volume is pathetic in some of the movies and the picture quality is like watching a VHS that was recorded in slow play. One of the movies is cut short. THERE ARE BETTER CHOICES OUT THERE!
1,Don't Buy,"The plastic mounting piece (to push into the ground) that comes with this rain guage is so flimsy ours broke instantly. It is no more than 1/8"" thick in the spots where it has holes drilled in it. Even if it had not broken on the first try to push it into the ground - any slight bump against it would break it. The gauge itself seems fine - but I cannot imagine why they made the mounting plastic so small."
3,I have played these games too many times to care anymore.,"I have senn these games too many times to really care about them anymore. ARMY MEN is a generally shallow strategy game, but shows its age. ARMY MEN II and ARMY MEN TOYS IN SPACE have better graphics, and are ganerally more fun to play. ARMY MEN AIR TACTICS is a good flying game, but is sorely lacking in the mission design. Overall, if you have not played any of these before, you will probably enjoy this. If you own these, or have played them before, there is nothing new here."
2,Faulty lids,I love the look of the blue serveware and wish the lids were better but they are flawed. The blue ceramic knobs are attached to the clear glass lids by a ceramic screw. I ordered two sets and one screw of two was broken in each set when it arrived. It is evident from the rattling sounds that the screws on the lids that did not arrive broken will break soon.
4,"Great cleanser, terrible packing and shipping","This is the best cleanser for normal to very dry skin that I have ever used. It can be tissued off, which is rare and appreciated. It leaves my skin clean and feeling very soft and moisturized.Unfortunately, the packing was extremely inadequate. The boxes of cleanser were simply put into a shipping box and not padded in any way. The package arrived with half the glass bottles smashed into dozens of pieces. The corresponding bottles of toner (also glass) were broken into bits.What a shame."
5,Wonderful!,Even better then American Mormon. They learned from the first one and improved the product! The interviews with non LDS were again fun to watch and see the lack of knowledge people have about LDS but the interviews with European LDS blew me away. The devotion and faith they have as exhibited by the effort they need to make to go to Temple is inspiring. The stories about Berlin and the Wall both before and after the fall made me cry. A great follow up to American Mormon but easily stands on it's own as a inspirational picture! Great work guy's!
2,Didn't buy and don't plan to.,"So here I was, planning to hit the ""Buy It Now"" button when I decide to read some reviews on the second season. Low and behold, the original music isn't on these discs, just some bad substituted backround music.For anyone who hasn't seen NE, you must think I'm a nit or drama critic, however for those of you who are true fans of this ground breaking series, the music is just as important to the shows as sugar is to a pie. NE is probably the first TV show that truly integrated quality music into the shows that made it just as poinent as the stories themselves.I won't watch a color retake of Casablanca and I won't buy NE with ""filler"" music. Alas, my only thoughts after this decision, is ""we'll always have Paris"".Ciao"
3,A little better than season 1.,"The addition of title cards on season 2 package eases the confusion of the double-sided discs, my main complaint. And, I'm beginning to understand others' gripes that the music is ignored. Perhaps there's a Web resourse that has cataloged some of the tunes used in the show. About the best and worst I can say for Northern Exposure -- the DVDs -- is that's it's a budget job, and it shows. I don't know who is scrimping, Universal or Fahley or some other. Still, the show's writers -- obviously well-read -- have made something just a little bit special, even if some of the show's charms have faded over the years. The basic themes are pretty standard, and quirkiness is a nothing new. Still, at the top of its game, such as the episode Slow Dance, Northern Exposure is unmatched for its New Age sense and sensibility. I'm a happy owner and give it all a B plus."
3,Poor Navegation on Season 1,"Not only are these seasons overpriced, but the navegation on season 1 was just pathetic. I rather buy a DVD of a season of Northern Exposure without the parka in exchange for a well produced DVD. The first one was not, unfortunately. I agree we should support these DVD's but I feel we're being taken advantage of on more than one level."
3,Where is the music we paid for?,"I am a Northern Exposure fan and had no problem paying the asking price to get season two with the original music. The probem is that the music has been removed from several scenes and replaced with generic instrumentals. We were told that the reason the price was so high for such a short season because it costs so much to get the rights to the music. Where is the music? Every song put into Northen Exposure was chosen to compliment or highlight a scene. I paid for the music, I would like to have it please."
1,DVDs vs VHS,"Hey everybody, I have a question for you. Has anyone bought both the VHS, and the DVD versions of these series? Do the VHS have the original music left intact, anyone know???Please LMK, OK?Thanks!Nanette<><"
2,What the hell is this?????,"God bless Universal for having the wherewithall to release this wonderful series on DVD, but what the hell is with the music? Not only are large chunks of original music missing, but they are replaced with something that would make John Tesh cringe. Anyone who knows anything about this series knows how integral the original music is to the overall effect and quality of the material. It's an absolute crying shame that this corner had to be cut. Beware anyone who is thinking about buying this set of OVERPRICED dvd's. Shame on you Universal!!!!"
3,More for our money,"Like a fine wine, you have to expect to pay a little more for the best. That said, NX Season 2 was a gift. I believe my wife got it at a wholesale club, and it wasn't overly expensive.Still, it's next to impossible to know what's on the disc you're putting into the DVD player. I gave Universal a break on Season 1, because it was simply so great to be able to watch NX again.This time around, I wanted a little more. The show still gets 5 stars. Universal gets 1. This averages out to 3 stars.Please give us a little more for our money with Season 3."
2,Too expensive!!,"I bought the first one, and I don't really care about the packaging all that much either way. But couldn't they have left off the puffy jacket, which makes it a pain to store so I took it off anyway, and made it a little cheaper? There were not very many episodes and the second season is even shorter. $42 is kind of pricey for such a short season. I have not yet bought it and will either hold out for a second hand copy or a box set."
2,northern exposure - the complete second sesason,sorry....but I can't accept the cost of the music being the factor for the big price charge. If this was the case why was Universal able to release a dozen titles on VHS a few years ago without adding a premium cost? And why only 8 episodes at a time. Truth of the matter is Universal feel they have a captive audience because of the cult following and they are just making excuses for the huge price.
1,Shame on Universal,"Universal said it was the music that drove up the cost- now we pay the same for seven episodes accompanied by elevator music. What a joke. I love Northern Exposure, but this is very poor customer service on Universal's part."
3,What happened to the music?,"I am overjoyed that NX is finally available on DVD. However, I have to say that I have been somewhat disappointed with the end product. Needing to flip the disc over for additional episodes seems like an older technology. I don't know any DVDs now that require you to do that. Most disappointedly though, is the fact that a lot of the music has been changed from the original version. I understood that the reason the NX DVD was so expensive was that they needed to pay copyright to keep all original music. If the music is indeed different, why are they still so expensive?Obviously, I'll take whatever I can get. This is one of the best television shows ever produced. Just have to say that I have been disappointed."
3,If you can't finish a story in 3 volumes...,"The book proves that writers of fantasy sagas are entirely out of their depth when limited to less than 100 pages. The one stirling exception is George RR Martin's ""The Hedge Knight"" - what a fantastic writer to be able to write something like that as well as the compelling multi-volume ""Song of Fire and Ice""! Anne McCaffrey is a distant second in this compilation..forget about Robert Jordan. If you can finish ""The Hedge Knight"" while standing in the book store, that's all you want from this book!"
1,Winner? Of what- Cheese?,"When we heard Will's first single we thought Woah and went to buy it- a piece of history. Then all the 10 year olds bought Gareths cover. Will released Light My Fire and that in itself was a piece of history. When I heard Gareth was releasing an original I was thinking high but all I got was a cheesy pop song that teaches you even if you know someone they can still cheat on you. Even Gareth... *gasp*Is this the type of song we want our kids to hear? So they grow up either shy and scared of having a relationship in case they cheat on you or actually being the cheater?This is pure cheesy pop and doesn't even deserve a place in the top 40, let alone the top 100."
1,"If not for vanity presses-This would not have been published!,","I can't believe I wasted my time reading this. I felt as if I were reading a childrens book. No history, no accounts of other people, just her cutesy monolog about ""little bitty things that go bump in the twilight"". NOT at all scary or historic. I would have settled for accurate but not even close. I couldn't even overlook how bad it was and just take down what was haunted because there was absolutely nothing there. I put the book in my bathroom where it has the slightest chance of doing some good. It's so embarrassing when one has guests and runs out of toliet paper."
2,"quality musicianship, but this CD just doesn't swing","There is no denying the superb talent of the Count Basie Orchestra. I've seen them live, and they have an incredible sound, but this CD is a far cry from the CBO of the 40's and 50's, that REALLY could swing! The faster numbers are not all that inspiring, and none of the songs had that something I can't describe that gets you foot tapping to that infectious swingin' rhythm."
3,Nothing special,Our son did not care for this book. Part of the issue is that it is written in eastern european language. It was hard for him to understand the language.
2,Maybe I got a bad apple,"I purchased this football at a sporting goods store. The quality of the leather is decent, though not a great deal better than the some of the nicer composites. Perhaps when I break it in more, the leather will become tackier, but that's not going to happen because the ball is too poorly made to play with. The seams at the nose are slightly misaligned, causing some asymmetry and a wobbly flight pattern. The side panels also bulge a bit right at the seams, no matter how inflated/deflated the ball is. I've tried to work the stiffness out of the leather here, but the bulge persists. To look at, these are very minor defects, but they combine to form a ball that is very difficult to throw a tight spiral with. I really can't use this ball. Too bad."
4,Good deal,I have not used these utensils long enough to say much but I do have another bamboo spoon that I like very much. This is a good price and I like what I read and hear about bamboo. This makes a nice gift item.
1,Ouch!,"This shoe was exactly what I was looking for, or so I thought. While it is adorable - the colors, the style - so cute, this is the most painful shoe I've ever worn. I hadn't even left my apartment before the back of the shoes were literally peeling the skin off of my heels. I've worn stilletos more comfortable than these shoes. I'll be returning them ASAP! Such a disappointment."
3,Drawing and Designing with Confidence,The book that I received about drawing and designing with confidence did me justice. I was able to finish a project. The different ways to draw vegetation on a plan really helped. I plan on letting my peers utilize this book so that they may develop a more confident way of designing.
2,Not Good For Beginner Artist,"The book has alot of great art work and teaches some inetersting points but unless you already an acomplished artist, this book will bore you,over whlem you, and mabe even discourage you.I didn't feel the confidence the books title said it would give. Mabe I will reread it when I have the confidence in my art work to understand what the book is talking about.Its not that its a bad book, its just filled with alot of bla bla bla and not enough instruction-"
5,Very Medicinal,"This product is a very potent medicinal cleansing tea. If you are serious about your health then I would recommend drinking about a gallon of this every day. Of course, do not drink this tea if you are on any kind of prescription medication due to the potentially dangerous side effects. This advice goes for any herbal supplement."
1,Terribly outdated and dangerous.,"I cannot fault the intent of Vriends since I do not know him personally, but this book has caused me as a hedgehog rescuer no end of difficulty. This book -- and others -- recommend things that are terrible for hedgehogs. Cedar shavings, as another reviewer noted, are recommended by this book. The aromatic oils from cedar shavings can cause respiratory failure in hedgehogs and other complications. It gets worse from there.The novice hedgehog owner is not going to pick up on these inaccuracies or errors, and that means that because of this book, hedgehogs are going to receive poor care. If you want a better book, try Dawn Wrobel's The Hedgehog: Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet OR try doing some research on the Internet instead, where the information is frequently peer-reviewed and kept more up-to-date than in a static publication."
3,Didn't do what I thought...,I expected the cleaner to really clean up the wheels. It didn't do any better than car wash soap and a sponge. Not worth the money.
5,Little Tykes Market Umbrella,Umbrella matched the picnic table I purchased at Toys R Us. The umbrella is of the highest quality just like an adult size. Our 2-yr old grandson enjoys it immensely.
4,NEED ENTERTAINING?,"I HAVE BOOKED SEVERAL ACTS IN MY LIFETIME AND HAVE USUALLY USED OTHER SOURCES TO OBTAIN ENTERTAINERS. THE PUBLIC LIBRARY DIRECTED TO THE AFORE MENTIONED BOOK, AND I QUICKLY OBTAINED A COPY OF MY OWN. THIS IS THE MOST CONCISE AND THOUROUGH REFERENCE I HAVE USED FOR THIS TYPE OF BUSINESS. IN ONE MANUSCRIPT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO ALL TYPES OF ACTS, NOT LIMITED TO MUSIC. I HAVE ALREADY RECCOMMENDED THIS BOOK TO MANY OF MY ASSOCIATES/ THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH"
4,Stunning Design but what about the employees?,"This was a visually impressive book on modern office fit-outs. The book did however lack evaluative criticism of the workspaces. Working in the industry myself I continuously have to deal with defective fit-outs, so an evaluation of the space with feedback from staff would have been great. Having said this though, the book shows some stunning designs and talks about the process behind the artistic decisions. A pity there are not many Asian/Pacific offices looked at.Definitely one of the best office design books. Great for the office or coffee table."
4,Help your adrenals feel better!,"Nothing like information, information and more information to help people detox. It's perfect. thank you. I look forward to sharing with my patients"
3,Run-of-the-mill mil-sf,"Not a bad series, and has a well-placed climax, but the world-building suffers from one particularly uberstalwart human culture and the need to balance humanity against a species that technologically should be kicking their behinds. The combat scenes were also not up to the standards of some of the more widely known works in the genre, lacking in detail and an overview of the tactics and strategy employed. Nonetheless, there was appealing characters and the plotting was well-handled enough to make finishing it no chore. Mildly recommended."
1,Not right,"Either this book was written by someone other than Tim Sandlin, or he was pressured by his publishers to write. This book reads like a load of crap put on paper without a moments thought, with a looming deadline. I have been a fan of Sandlin for years and waited patiently for some new words from him. I would have rather waited 5 more years for something good than read this."
3,Main Problem - Not based on an actual fletch book!,Not based on an actual fletch book. funny at parts - especially the second tim
1,Stick with the first one...,Lightning only struck once for 'Fletch'. Nothing could top the original anyway. True 'Fletch' fans already know this--
3,Not in English,"This product is listed as Language ""English and French"" with subtitles in English. It does have subtitles in English, but this movie is in Japanese. You will have to read subtitles. Don't be fooled by the faulty description. The movie is great. We saw it in the theater dubbed in English. We thought we were getting a movie dubbed in English since it said the language was English."
3,It was a'right...,"Light is a young college student who finds a notebook which gives him the extraordinary power to kill anyone whose name he writes down on its pages. At first he executes only bad guys and criminals, but soon, Light begins to justify killing the good guys who track him down, including FBI agents. Soon, his life becomes a cat and mouse game between the mysterious computer genius L and Light with society caught in the middle.This was an interesting film with a thought provoking premise, however, I lost empathy for Light really quickly and that sort of killed my enjoyment. Light showed no remorse ever for the deaths he caused but instead seemed to revel in the attention and the challenge.This film is a teen drama, based on a manga/anime series and will appeal to fans of those genres. I thought the premise was clever but without an engaging character whose motives I sympathized with, I just lost interest. The ending was a surprise, but screamed cliffhanger!"
4,Great Movie,This movie followed the series very will with some changes. This is one of the best live action movie based on an anime I have seen yet.
5,Must Have,"I loved this book, and highly recommend it. Easy short stories to read. They say there a million ways to the top, this book will help you decide on what WILL work for you in sharing the way to brilliant compensation."
2,Made for most US cars,"Received these today, the package had been previously opened and closed again with staples. they did not fit a Subaru and in small print at the bottom it reads, ""Fits most American cars"". Would have been nice to have this information before I ordered."
5,They work. What more can you ask for?,"These screws replaced my standard ones and were easy to install. There were no instructions, so I'm not sure what the plastic things are for, but I'm happy with the design of the screw itself. You actually CAN'T use a store-bought wrench similar to this one since the screws have a small pin directly in the center of the hole that prevents a standard wrench from being inserted.Certainly not fool-proof, but worth the extra peace-of-mind"
4,Not What I Expected,"I enjoyed this book, but I was disappointed at the ending. I won't spoil it for anyone planning to read the book, but I found the conclusion unsatisfying, not at all neat and happily-ever-after-ish."
3,This could have been a good book.,"This could have been a good book. An insightful psychobiography of Sylvia Plath would have been a great gift to many of us. Periodically Stevenson's book approaches this, but too often it degenerates into psychological platitudes and sophomoric heckling. It lacks the high style of Dido Merwin's recollections and critique (fortunately included in the book) as well as the careful development of a psychological theory, as in, for example, Erickson's psychobiographies. Is Stevenson aware of the transparency of her dislike of Plath?Although the Gulliver paradigm expresses an important aspect of Sylvia Plath's psychological difficulties, sometimes the shoe fits:""The spider-men have caught you, winding and twining their petty fetters....How they hate you. They converse in the valley of your fingers, they are inchworms. They would have you sleep in their cabinets...."""
3,Double Switch was better,It has an ok story to it. But it will drive you crazy. At lease Double Switch has a warning system to let you know where the people where.
5,Masterfully Designed,"This book is the collection of a five day work shop that Moshe Feldenkrais gave.This book is very well written. It has its own style which lends to its form. The words ""bring home"" many of the teachings within."
2,Pirated version,"When I received this DVD Amazon.com--not another vendor--I found the packaging to be that of a pirated copy. For the list price, I would have like to known that this DVD is a copy, not an original."
5,If you want to regain control of your body - this DVD is for you !,"At 52 years old, I am becoming reacquainted with parts of my body that I had forgotton were even there. I am starting to feel whole again. Not just a brain dragging around this mass of dead weight, called a body. I was looking for an Iyengar Yoga instructor, by way of a DVD, who could help me to revive my yoga practice. This is it ! She delivers a complete and thorough daily practice that will produce immediate changes in your body and awaken your whole being. I feel wonderful. She provides alternate versions of poses that may be too challenging for less experienced or rusty practitioners. This is pure, straight forward Iyengar Yoga. I highly recommend this DVD to everyone."
1,"Performance yes, instruction no",This video is impressive to watch but is no help whatever in learning the movements and postures of yoga.
5,The Life I hope to have,"I love this book! I have dreams and goals in my life and after reading this book, I know they will come true for me, like they have for Michael and Jon. My best wishes to them and their family!"
3,Basically Good but lots of little errors.,"This is quite a good book and is very good at covering the details. Most of what is said is accurate and well thought out. However, there are a lot of sections that show some unfortunate inconsitancies and the main thrust is very much against what is becoming the more ""modern"" way of looking at diets and exercise. There is a complete disregard for any form of nutritional supplement hype which is good and the approach to steroid use is excellent - a big change from the books that try to stop you by pretending they dont work - Covert's books explains the risks.Overall, a good book but there are better - look for ""The Ketogenic Diet"" - also, this book seems mainly aimed at people who want to get into the aerobic types of fitness."
5,Smart Exercise: An Overview,"An outstanding text. Covert does not deal with fad diets or gimmicks. Having first seen him on PBS, I decided to buy the text which was more informative and better than the show. He provides common sense no nonsense techniques on ways to achieve and maintain fitness with the approporiate physiological background as support. He tells you how your body burns fat and how to trick its inherint self preservation mechanisms. Easy to read, interesting, and not overly technical, it is a must read for anyone serious about becoming or maintaining overall fitness."
5,One of the most under-rated western series of all time.,"If you're a fan of the ""Old West"" or of western movies, this is a ""must ad"" to your collection. The character portrayed by Walter Brennan is excellent. This series is fresh with a great combination of respect and action that is know in the legendary West."
4,the guns of will sonnett,"This series took me back to weekends in my early years waiting for this show to come onto TV for the afternoon. Definitely nostalgia involved in the enjoyment but even for that, the series tends to still stand up to a watchable event. Probably more aware on the limited background shots and simple style of preaching style of dialogue, but it has been fascinating to watch the actors who appeared as guest artists in the series. If you liked the serial western series, well worth watching otherwise may not your thing!!"
2,"all out, bad music","the first disc's name should be changed from sub to sub-standard, really it is not good. there are some mediocre (1,2,8,10,13,14,18) songs that are better than the others but all in all it is a bad disc. althought things do start to look up in the second disc. there are more good to mediocre songs, but there is nothing that is excellent on this cd-set, the three end songs on disc two are the best on the whole set. all in all the whole cd is very ordinary, and at times the level does stoop to below standard, to all out !@#$"
5,Great product,This worked as well as previous reviewers claimed! We have a river rock shower floor that was taking all day to dry as the grout was absorbing too much water. We applied the sealer and problem solved!
1,Clapper rip off,This doesn't work at all I tried clapping--yelling everything and it doesn't do anything--don't waste your money. To rip off a Grand Mother like this is so ridiculous.
3,It has a flaw.,It turns on as advertised but what is disappointing is that the light continues to blink after clapping it off. I have to go and turn the light off for some time before turning it back to the on setting without the blinking of the lightbulb. It now becomes a pain in the backside to use. I would not reccommend it.
4,I like!,"I'm using my clapper to turn on/off the torch lamp in my bedroom, and so far, it's working as it should be. If you're using it for an appliance other than a lamp, I suggest you read other reviews. If you plan to use it for a lamp, I say it works as it should be."
1,does not work - a waste of time and materials,I gave this to the mother of a friend of mine to help her turn off her light. They plugged it in and it did not work. There was no company name or info listed on the product...maybe a fake?
4,Works good in quiet room.,"Bought clapper because my light was all the way across my room and I always had to climb over my bed to turn it on/off. I keep a window fan right next to my light. The clapper had a hard time hearing my claps over the fan. It would hear the first clap, but not the second. I would have to make very distinguished and perfectly timed claps to activate the clapper. But once I got the timing right it wasn't really a problem. Also, since then I moved into an apt. All of the outlets are close to the floor, so I cannot pulg the clapper into any of them. It will serve its purpose though."
2,I did not like this product,I didn't last as long as I thought it would. I used it about two months! Not worth the money.
1,send,"Clapper was shipped from China, taking an excessive amount of time. This clapper is not designed for 110/220 American systems. It is totally useless to me. This will likely terminate any future purchases from Amazon"
2,Disappointment,"I thought this would be great to turn on my bedside lamp at night from the doorway instead of leaving on a hall light, crossing over to the other end of the bedroom, turning on the light then going back to turn off the hall light. It wasn't. First there two slots, one slot takes two claps and one slot takes three claps. Many times it doesn't hear your claps unless your right on top of it. Other times I come home and the lamp has turned itself on and burned electricity. I even found a burn mark in my lamp shade. My house could have caught on fire!I tried both slots. Sometimes it worked but you had to work at it. The two clap slot tended to go off at the slightest noise. The three clap slot tended not to hear you and you had to clap again and again. Not a good buy in my mind."
2,was neat,"it was neat, but then it got old needing to always use it to turn on the lights, since it wouldn't always respond. But, fun, cause hitting the wall twice, coughing twice, and many other sounds can turn in on and off, just gotta make sure they sound the same twice in a row."
1,Terrible product and Even WORSE customer service!,We ordered 2 clappers for christmas gifts and neither worked out of the box. Tried to return after our gift recipients let us know they were defective and was told too bad. Do NOT order from these people!
4,Clap On!,"Works better than I expected.I got it partly for the novelty, but am finding it very useful.It's been triggered a few times by accident, usually by a cough.But as I said got it for the novelty, so when this has happened it's been amusing.It controls the lights by our bed, I would not use it for anything too critical."
2,very sensitive,it turn on and off by the noise of the door and my desk chair.now one wants to use it.
3,I Like but too sensitive,Well i like it but is i have the TV normal it will turn on and off the light....so i turn off the switch or disconnect the device only work on quiet place!!!
3,user friendly,"I've been using the clapper for years on a living room light that is hard to get at, it works. The only problem is they only last about 6 months of constant use. I can purchase this item at Walgreens at christmas time and usually buy two so I have until the following year. When it gave out before end of year I was happy to find the item although it was much higher priced, but that is the price one pays when having to buy outside your local area."
2,The Crapper,"This line says it all""don't buy it unless you plan to live in silence.""Sooner or later maybe I will learn how to trick the clapper and I will enjoy it. Or as others I will just unplug it-- and return it next year.. when they are all the rage.. and get my money back and buy the HERB GARDEN- a much better gift. ( what happened to the pocket fisherman.. its GOT to be better than this!"
1,Disappointed,This was a gift to my daughter who has longed for one forever....boy what a peice of junk....if I had away to return it I would with a doubt. Junk Junk!!!
2,CLAPPER NOT WORKING,"WORKED FOR A WEEK OR SO, WHEN I MOVED IT TO A NEW LOCATION IN HOUSE IT NO LONGER WORKS VERY UNHAPPY WITH IT! DID NOT SAVE BOX OR RECEIPT, NEVER THOUGHT THAT IT WOULDN'T KEEP ON WORKING!!!!"
4,Worked well,"I bought this for overflow sleeping when we had a house of grandkids. This was a little short for the 3 year old, but we put a pillow at the end to support his feet and it worked great. He loved his special bed and I expect it will be used many times."
2,Not a good message about self esteem,I love Sandra Boynton books. We have many and I want the rest but I just don't care for this book. Either I totally missed the point or she's sending the wrong message here. The hippo is left out of fun things time and time again then when the gang finally thinks to invite the hippo he only hesitates for a moment then runs to join the gang. The gang are inconsiderate fake friends. The hippo does not need fake friends and I will not encourage my child to join other kids that usually leave him out.
2,the only Boynton book I didn't love,"My daughters don't care much for this book either, but they love all the rest of her books. This one just doesn't sit well with me- I don't really like the tacit encouragement of leaving someone out."
2,No point,"My daughter doesnt get too excited about this book. I always introduce it to her after reading a book she brings me. Her attention gets drawn to something else before I am half way through. Maybe she'll like it when she is a bit older. I don't get the ending: ""But not the armadillo..."""
4,Buuuuuuut... YES! the hippopotamus! (But not... the armadillo.),"Poor li'l armadillo. *sniff*There isn't a moral message in this story. A hippo sulks while her friends have fun without her (I always think of the hippo as a girl, anyway) - probably not even noticing that she's there.This is great for hamming it up, with lots of fake sobs as the story goes on.Then she is given her metaphorical engraved invitation and is delighted to join in. And now the armadillo is on the sidelines, probably to have his own (armadillo always seemed like a guy to me) happy ending later.Simple, short story for short kids."
3,Cute but nothing spatacular.,Cute but nothing spatacular. I like some of the other Boynton books better.
4,"Great songs; weird, tall Baby Bop","My toddler granddaughter loves the songs and so do I, but there is one about this video that I don't like. From what I can tell, Baby Bop is first introduced on this video. When she first appears she dances in a manner that my daughter and I were not comfortable with for a children's video. Plus Baby Bop is adult size in this video. She's as tall as Barney! Even though she's adult size, she speaks in baby talk like ""Me very afraid."" This was just too weird and inappropriate. My toddler granddaughter did not seem to notice any of this. Anyway, I'm glad that in later videos, Baby Bop shrunk to her current height and no longer speaks in baby talk or dances in a manner more appropriate for an exotic dancer."
1,This was horrible!,My kids thought this was much more boring than the other Barney videos. I would never recomend Barney in Concert. I would try Barney Nursery Rhymes With Mother Goose.
3,Disappointing,"I'm a huge Stones fan, but maybe it's because I don't have the Dolby Digital setup yet, but I found the atmosphere as described by others to be somewhat lacking on this DVD. It's often hard to make out the crowd noises which usually add so much to the atmosphere of a live concert. The sound track serves to highlight Jagger's not so great performance.It was also fairly shocking to see how old Mick Jagger and Keith Richards look. Keith appears somewhat lacklustre, wandering about the stage as if he's just going through the motions. He looks positively bored in places.Once I have the proper sound setup, I may re-evaluate this, but my recommendation would be, if you don't have a good sound setup, give this a miss and buy the studio recorded album of the same title. It's much better. (Of course, you only get the new tracks, but you have the older ones already, don't you?)"
4,Typical Stones concert...,"The Rolling Stones in St.Louis,Mo. Excellent song selection and a fine show indeed. The AC/3 sound is very bass heavy, but well done. The surrounds don't produce much music, mostly background noise. But, all things considered, the front, center and subwoofer mix is more than enough. If you like the Stones, BUY IT..."
5,OUTSTANDING,Extreme high quality recording. The Woodie Cam is amazing! Check out the exploding big screen TV and the bridge that comes out of the middle of the stage!!! I just wish the last tour of the states had all the gear (they didn't bring the bridge or exploding TV to Cleveland).
5,"""Live at the Max"" is good but ""Bridges"" sounds better","Well, when Keith Richards struts out on stage in a leopard-skin coat and starts riffing on ""Satisfaction""-it just doesn't get any cooler than that. Great sound, great picture, and I'm just talking about the VHS version. I liked this so much I bought the DVD of the Stones ""Live at the Max"", (I finally converted to DVD),and I think this VHS beats that DVD as far as the sound.The Rolling Stones have been around longer than anyone else. They have the attitude, the songs, and the best one-two guitar work in rock and roll.Get this for a great concert experience.I know my taste tends towards the older stuff, but check this out and you'll see why these guys have had such longevity."
5,The emotion of this CD is simply amazing!,"The power of the singer/songwriter's love for her lost child is the most moving experience I have ever had with music. As a young person thinking about starting a family, I am in awe of the love expressed in this CD. It doesn't make me nervious or scaried, it does just the opposite. To feel a love that strong must be the most amazing life experience possible. Thank you for such a wonderfull album."
4,"A little frustrating, but otherwise fun!","For the most part, Titan Quest is an extremely interesting game, with great graphics. And, with all the monsters to kill, it's great for stress relief.For the most part.There are a few monsters, such as the Telkines and the Dragonians, that are difficult and frustrating to kill. The first Telkine keeps regenerating his health, and I had to go online to figure out how to stop him from doing it. The second keeps multiplying himself. I've yet to get to the third."
2,Nothing new,"It is not the worst game I have played this year, but, far from the best. As we age, we see new movies or books or games that have been done before. Sometimes the new movie or game is acutally better than the original. Usually though, it is an average redo with new technology to ""make it the best ever"". If you never played some of the older games like Diablo, than this is well worth buying. Otherwise, you may be bored. Sort of like watching another slasher flick; you know when she is going to die."
4,Worth the price,I played it untill I passed which says a lot since I'm the type of person who gets bored quick and switches to a new game before the last one's finished.It's not a GOTY candidate but it is an entertaining action dungeon crawler with good personalities.
3,Not Stout's Best,"The opening is good, but the solution is not. Having given clear reasons why one person can not be the criminal (motive not yet ripe) that person winds up being guilty, with the only reason give being that the person didn't realize that his chance hadn't really come. Not up to stout's usual plotting standard, but still worth reading for a Nero Wolfe fan.-David E. Siegel"
3,An Early Mystery,I read this book after several by Robert Goldsborough. Although I quite enjoyed this novel I prefer the way that Goldsborough writes the Nero Wolf Mysteries.
2,Not the same body butter as it was,"So disappointed in The Body Shop, as they have changed the formulation for the Shea Body Butter. The smell is different and so is the consistency - it's thinner. I have used this product for over 10 years and it was the only product that kept my skin looking hydrated and young looking. It lasted all day, whereas other products would wear out and I'd have to reapply. The ingredients on the labels are different."
3,vey strong scent,"The scent is really strong. This is fine, I suppose, if you really like the smell of grapefruit. I also have Body Shop sweetpea, cocoa, shea, orange, & lemon, so I do have points of comparison, and this, for me, is too strong while the others are not. The lemon is a little too heavily scented also but not to the same degree."
3,Does not smell much like lemons. Good moisturizer.,"I love the smell of lemons. When I saw Sweet Lemon body butter, I couldn't order it fast enough. It's a good moisturizer for normal to dry skin. After a momentary greasiness, it absorbed completely and continued to leave my skin soft after washing twice with soap.Unfortunately, the scent also lingered. The top notes are vaguely citrus-like, but once they have faded, the lingering scent is, I'm not sure what, a bit floral perhaps? Whatever it is, it's not lemon. It's not even citrus. I found the scent odd and off-putting and the butter ended up in the garbage.Five stars for moisturizing. No stars for the scent."
3,Great for conditioning lips as long as you remember to blend thoroughly,"Available in a wide variety of delicious scents, The Body Shop's lip butter is a solid contender in the fight against chapped lips. The incredibly thick, creamy texture is very soothing and reminds me more of a lotion than a traditional lip balm. The wear time is nothing extraordinary, but the product does leave my pout soft and conditioned for a couple of hours after application. The major drawback of this item is that it's not completely transparent. You have to be careful to blend the butter into your skin entirely or you'll be left with an awkward white film coating your lips.Read more reviews at http:[...]"
5,Must Have,With out this book I would still be trying to figure things out. If your serious about getting the call this is the best investment you can make. The author has even answered questions that I have emailed to him. My only regret is that I didn't buy it before my first interview.
5,great for re-sawing wood,"A great fence for the price! set up takes a bit of time, and you have to set the fence to the deflection of the blade you are using. Once it's dialed in you'll love it."
4,Rabbits and Chipmunks Hate This Trap,"I set this trap in a well trafficked location in my yard, and I have to check it daily to make sure that there is not a body in it. One must be careful in setting it, and there are several videos on line that demonstrate the proper way to do that, as well as the proper location to place such a trap. A body hold trap does not necessarily kill the animal out right, and the use of the trap is not for the squeamish, as one might have to club the trapped animal. Given the amount of damage in my garden, I do not find this requirement to be anything other than gratifying. It would get 5 stars if it did not rust so readily."
3,Hasn't trapped anything yet,"My son wanted these to trap some small animals, but so far, nothing. He's had these over a year, and I'm not sure he's used them lately, but I think he just gave up."
4,too many guitars,"This is a lovely coffee-table photo book. Entwistle's comments are usually pretty brief, save for a couple detailed descriptions. Too many guitars; I would have preferred basses only! The backgrounds, both interior and exterior, provide a nice glimpse into life on an English country manor. (On one of the instruments shot outdoors, there's a bee sitting on the pickguard.)"
3,Beautifully Illustrated - but pointless?,"Sara Squirrell is a beautifully illustrated book but we found the story to be rather pointless. Sara goes out to get an acorn, ends up being asked to get a lot of things for others, delivers them to the others, realizes she forgot her acorn, and then ignores people afterwards so she can spend time getting another acorn.My 8 year old read it and told me that's why she ignores me when i ask her to pick her toys. Because she doesn't want to do things to make someone else happy.I was not amused and this book was promptly thrown away."
3,nice but a bit hard to use,"bought this for my 2 1/5 yr old daughter who seems to have chapped cheeks all the time, with mild bumps. So far it appears to help make her cheeks more soft and less dry, but doesn't do much with the bumps;It feels more like a glue stick, kind of hard to apply because it's so dry, but then it's easier for the kid to apply it herself, she she wouldn't let me help, so with this being a bit dry it doesn't spill or get all over the place.the smell is a bit strange to me...I would probably prefer it not to have any smells at all...over all it's an ok product, pricey though..."
3,vintage Enchantment,Not the group I first heard 30 plus years ago but still good enough for viewing.
1,Its great if you only planned on using it twice :(,"So, this item was a blessing, until i used it twice and the motor blew out. I can't even return it because the policy is 21 days and the warrantee I tried to mail when I first bought it came back as ""undeliverable"" . I spent $200 bucks, $100 for each use I got out of it...I am beyond annoyed"
3,Had to send in for repair,"I really like this watch - unfortunately I have to send it in for repairs. There was condensation forming on the face of the watch. Then the upper left corner of the face was not displaying anything.It happened within a year of purchase, so I mailed it in and it should be covered by warranty. I did have to include a $7 check to cover the S&H; fees. I thought that part was bogus - but comes with purchasing online, I guess.Hopefully I won't have any problems with the new one!"
5,Want to start your own business???,"well this is the one for you...with or with out being a mom, i am a mom, but not to a child...i have 2 dogs and a cat. and i am seriously thinking i want to build a business from home so that if the time comes that i am pregnant or have a child that i can be there for him or her...this book will help you find the job you want, then find ways to market it, make it legal and give you ideas to make it better/more productful. it also gives you different peoples stories of what they started and how it has worked for them.You have to check it out!"
5,We need more people like Liz out there.,"Us moms need someone like Liz to help us out. Whether you have a degree or not, the children are our future and us moms need to be there to teach them respect and love. Unfortunately it takes two incomes to make ends meat anymore and it is great that she can give us advice so we can secure our future. Everyone should be more grateful to her. A big THUMBS UP TO THE CARING PEOPLE OF THE WORLD."
2,lousy sound quality,"Yes, I agree with the above review Jose Carreras makes a great Romeo however, I find the sound quality to be so subpar that the enjoyment of the performance is affected. I think I'll order the highlight disk of Romeo & Juliette with Alagna and Gheorghiu instead. I do prefer Jose Carreras however not enough to put up with the poor audio. I also have other live non studio recordings such as Poliuto with Callas and Corelli on EMI but find the sound quality more tolerable than on this particular release."
3,Somewhat convoluted,I ordered this book after listening to an interview with the author. The stories of the various musicians and performances were somewhat endearing but there wasn't anything to tie them together. In some ways the book reads like a textbook - very factual and precise but then segues into anectdotes and childhood memories. Perhaps it is Cottle's bias as Gradova's son that fuels his need to pontificate the minutia of his family couch. This book does get better as you read but it certainly is heavier on detail than I expected and is in serious need of editing.
4,Eddie Landsberg has a great memory,"According to the album notes,Eddie Landsberg discoveredthe unique jazz vocalist,Eddie Jefferson when he heard the classic 'The Main Man' album when he was 12,decided he wasn't a singer and eventually gravitated to the organ.'The Main' Man' is one of my favorite albums-and 'Remembering Eddie Jefferson' withGiacomo Gates doing most of the vocals is a great tribute."
2,Near Miss,"""Grand Drive"" are a band who I'd heard a lot about, and just sort of assumed I'd like. On the surface they're just the sort of band who I'd go for - intelligent, guitar based, folky, soulful. But for some reason this just never hits the spot. Their sound is too mushy, too honey-coated and gooey. There are some nice numbers on here; ""Sleepy"" stands out, and ""A Ladder to the Stars"" combines a nice tune with thoughtful lyrics but the rest melt away into a sort of nice, mellow but ultimately unsatisfactory mist. It's all well and good, but it lacks real impact."
4,"Not quite a song's tape, but still very good!","""Barney's Musical Scrapbook"" is a show full of segments of ""Barney & Friends"" episodes from the 1995 season. It includes the characters: Barney, Baby Bop, BJ, Shawn, Tosha, Jason, Kathy, Juan, Carlos, Min, Kenneth, and Julie. The segments are from the ""Barney & Friends"" episodes: ""Shawn and the Beanstalk,"" ""Up we go!,"" ""It's raining, it's pouring...,"" ""Ship, Ahoy!,"" and ""Shopping for a Surprise."" It is approximately 50 minutes long and has 16 songs. This show is not a song's tape, but it is a very good show!"
1,Very slow. Many pointless scenes,"This movie was a bore. It had many long, drawn out scenes that added nothing to the plot or the interest. It was all I could do to get through it all. I wish I had rented it. Now I own it and won't likely view it again."
2,"hate or love it, in my case hate it.","they say that you hate this dvd or you love it and in my case, i found out that i hated it. Boring throughout the film although i do want to say that the acting is good. it's just that it is not very interesting!"
4,Excellent Film about an Unexplored People,"Paul Thomas Anderson is truly a talented director and an even better screenwriter. His film about a close-knit, surrogate family of porn stars is beautifully told and brilliantly portrayed by one of the best casts of recent years. While real porn stars are looked down upon, I thought it was really amazing how Anderson used the sex/porn idea to lure people into the movie, but made them stay by showing great characters and great actors portraying them. Dirk Diggler, the character played by Mark Wahlburg (who shows that he really has become an actor) was based off of an actual fallen porn star. I'm a 17-year old boy, and I'm sure a lot of people would be surprised to hear me say this!"
4,"Watchable,will leave you thinking for days","I like Boogie Nights for two main reasons - it has an interesting storyline, and a fantastic soundtrack. The movie focuses on the porn industry of the 70's and offers an almost raw insight into the highs and lows of such an industry. Heather Graham shines as Rollergirl, and Julianne Moore is brilliant as 'mother' to them all. Mark Walhberg does an impressive job of a young man entering the porn industry. We travel with him through the good and very bad times - the drugs, the loss of stardom etc etc. Boogie Nights isn't for everyone, but I enjoyed it. It will leave you thinking for a few days afterwards. Makes you appreciate that you're not involved in drugs!"
1,i didnt like this movie,"but i didnt really like altmans film ""nashville."" and this film seems to be greatly influenced by nashville. i like other films that were influenced by nashville (the blues brothers movie, oh brother where are thou) but i didnt like boogie nights. i can tell you exactly why i didnt like this film. it wasnt really that funny. it wasnt really that clever. it wasnt really that profound. it wasnt really that realistic. and it wasnt really that entertaining. however, the song ""boogie nights"" was my favorite 45 i bought in the 4th grade."
4,"Rich, rewarding, and well-acted","If you're one of those rare people who would rather go see great character actors (guys like Don Cheadle, William Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, John Reilly) then this movie will be a treat. These four -- and others -- turn in scene stealing performances that never quite overshadow the surprisingly impressive central performance by Mark Wahlberg.Director Paul Thomas Anderson takes viewers inside the porn industry at a time when video was replacing celluloid, but it's the characters that dominate, not the setting. The delicately interwoven stories will grab you and move you even if you've never seen a single porno flick.The soundtrack is great, too."
5,Amazing.,"Amazing script, performances, characters, ""historical accuracy."" A classic. Burt Reynolds. Why did I forget about him all these years?""Are they lizard? No, they're Italian."" A great line in film history."
1,Poor Directed Movie,"I thought this movie was about disco, but it was all about the porn business. Come on! You got to be kidding! Good actors and actresses, but after a while I got sick of it and returned it. When a better movie comes along, call me."
3,dirk diggler,"this is the Mark Wahlberg, shows his you know, how do you do at the end movie. Reynolds is great as the porn director. Graham is hot and in flames. though some moments are very sick and unwatchable. but it has its powerful moments"
2,defective product,"it seems that all the boogie night dvds I exchange, the special subtitle features do not show while the movie is playing as advertised."
5,This movie tells it like it is,I could really relate to this movie. Having spent 2 years as a porn actor I truely identified with Dirk Diglers character. I endured many of the same problems Dirk had. Thie movie really brings back memories. Bravo
1,Too Much Nothing,"This movie goes on and on and has nothing to say. Simply put, there's no plot. The plot arc is completely linear. On and on and on. What's the point?"
4,Melts in your ears,"I have seen a million movies, but never has the music got my attention as much as this soundtrack caught mine. I love the Sarah Mclachlan classic ""ice cream"" and ""I'm not a f*cking drag queen"" cracked me up. ""Perfect fingers"" and ""32 flavors"" by Ani defranco, an artist that I simply didn't bother to pay any mind to before, made my ears stand up. I feel the best song was not on the album. ""My Whole Life"" by the underrated Bif Naked just captured everything I love about music. Definitely check out this soundtrack and appreciate the movie. Enjoy!"
4,Pretty and good,"I love this pendant. I've bought two years ago and people still compliments it. I didn't have any problem receiving, the process was fast, and the packaging arrived in good shape. Also, as it was mentioned before, the picture is very accurate."
5,Five stars,This necklace came very nicely priced and has a very sturdy chord. Coming from someone who takes necklaces on and off all the time I get really sick of chords/chains breaking. That and it also looks very nice. :3
1,"Answers are great, it's HOW you get them that's the problem.","It's the most frustrating thing when they tell you the answer but not how to get to it, they don't explain any of the test answers in FULL detail. I struggle in math more than I could say and it will be my second time taking it and alas, it doesn't help at all. How do they expect you to figure this out when they don't even show you how to arrive at the answer??? It's fun to try and figure out how to actually go about solving the problem but frankly I don't have the time. Next time, I'm getting a tutor."
4,Great supplement to other self-teaching books,"Anything written by Rupert Snell is a best bet. His other books in the Teach Yourself series are wonderful, especially the Beginners Hindi. I agree with the other reviewer that the repeated music between sections becomes quite annoying, but this is true for the entire new conversation cd series. Nevertheless, this is a fantastic addition to your Hindi learning materials.It is also important to note that the booklets only use Romanized writing, so don't expect the ""real"" Devanagari script. The series is meant primarily for auditory comprehension, but it would have been nice to see the words in the original writing system."
1,Does not fit Canon 5D Mark III,"The screen protector for the 5D III is too big and there are air bubbles along the edge of the rear LCD screen. BoxWave does not have a good return policy - once you peel the back off the screen protector film you can no longer return it. Well the screen protector will not lay flat so I had to remove it. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless you want to throw away your money. I originally was really excited to receive this screen protector because I've used several BoxWave screen protectors in the past and they all fit good and were a reasonable price. However, this product forced me to switch brands and find a new screen protector for my new DSLR."
5,"this kid has soul, the blues and ability","When I first saw him it was on a late night with Conan O'brien. He was beating the hell out of his Taylor guitar and I was blown away I have a lot of his stuff but I love his voice and playing style and he is just a natural performer too... check out The Wanderer, but listen to the whole thing too and you'll want more of this guy!.. charlie"
2,john mayer with talent,"marc broussard is a very talented stage performer, he hasnt been able to translate his musical talent to a record yet. he has all the ability to jam and make worthwhile music, but wastes it on trying to be louisianas answer to john mayer, not the direction this skillful musician needs to be going in, if you have a lady who enjoys john mayers sound, then she'll love this crooners style, otherwise id take a pass on this cd..."
4,interesting book,"i find this book to have some interesting aspects, however my most favorite alchemy book of all time is called alchemy survival guide, it is part of a series of instructional books written by an adept.Alchemy Survival Guide: The Labyrinth Made Simple (Volume 4)"
4,Good for the price,Perfect for a moderate level of heart training. Works well and is simple to operate. The lack of a lap chrono feature is probably enough to be worth buying the slightly more expensive model.
2,"""REALLY DUMB!.........""",I picked up the book and read the back. It seemed it would be fun. I started reading it. It was boring and stupid. I got through half the book and put the REALLY DUMB book down. I guess it's just me!)
5,EXCELLANT!,"This an excellant book. I have read Redwall, Martin the Warrior, Mattemeo, and Mossflower, also. This is by far the best. Great fight scenes too!"
4,"Actually, not that bad.","She's not that bad in my opinion. She may not be a great doll for a first impression. But think of her as an Ooh La La doll. After all, that collection had this face mold. I've seen her many times in stores and it's just her forhead that shows too much. I'm sure that if you cover it with her hair, she'll look fine. The clothes may not be the best, but I think the 1st ones are cool. (...)"
1,Fools and their money,"HDMI is a digital interface. Digital signals don't give a single solitary damn about the name on the cables.The only possible reason for giving these things a five star review is that you spent the cash and you need to convince yourself that you aren't dumb as a fence post.Buy the $2 cables, they work exactly as well. Unless it's worth $130 to you to have the name on the cable."
1,5$ HDMI Cable is Just as good as 100$,"HDMI 1.3 had the same data transfer rates no matter if it's a 5$ cable or a 100$ cable. Monster company is trying to rip customers off of money with the old mindset of ""HIGH SPEED"" cables. In the analog era cables did make difference, because information was sent in analog wave form, so quality was indeed important. Now with digital cables everything is sent in series of zeroes and ones, the signal is either sent or not sent, there is no quality aspect to it whatsoever.Don't let the gold plate fool you, the guy who bought a 5$ HDMI 1.3 cable off of ebay is getting just as good of signal from your 100$ overpriced piece of wire."
2,Overpriced.,"If this cable was $15, it might be worth it for construction quality. For signal quality alone? I will stick with my $6 HDMI cable from Monoprice.com....thanks.You will NOT see a difference."
1,Didn't work,"Cable is defective. Need to see if company that I purchased it from will make it good, or have to go through hassle of getting Monster Cable to honor its warranty. Alot of cash for a non-working cable."
1,"This review is not for the cable, but for Amazon","I ordered Monster Mseries M1000 HDTV HDMI cable from Amazon (sold by Amazon.com).The shipping was great. I received the cable in a few days. However, when I opened the box, it was NOT the Monster M1000 HDMI cable that I ordered.I called Amazon and reported the problem. They told me that they were going to ship a replacement cable to me right away. And yes, the second cable was arrived 3 days later (again, great shipping). Guess what? This cable was worse than the first one. It did not have even monster logo on the cable itself. Actually, it had no logo on it. The cable was small, short, and I think it was a very cheap one.They shipped to me two FAKE Monster cables in a row. What to say? I just wonder if it is the way Amazon does its business?!!!"
1,Jesus reincarnate,"I bought this cable the other day with some money I found in an old pair of pants, and oh wow did I notice a difference. not only was I receiving digital signals with 0's, 1's, AND 2's now, but I could now transmit that signal to the moon and beyond.however, these do not give mere boosts in signal quality, but have affected my personal life as well. since buying these wonderful gold plated beasts, my life has taken a miraculous turn. females now fawn over me as I walk by, I am able to control the elements, and Jesus himself walked up to me and said he was eternally grateful for my purchase.in summation, if you buy these cables you are basically submitting yourself to the kind of hyperbole campaign that I just mentioned above."
1,Save yourselves before its too late!,"I fear that I have limited time. I plugged this HDMI cable into my home theater pc and it began taking control of my home. All of my electronic appliances are conspiring against me. I fear that they'll hack my cell phone soon and that I'll be cut off from the rest of the world. I'm not able to get out. I am lost but you can still save yourselves. Do not buy one of these cables! Your life dependafsdhkjGH""JK"
1,As technically necessary as a jewel-encrusted USB flash drive,"Spending multiple hundreds of dollars on an HDMI cable to carry a digital signal from your video player to your TV and expecting to see a better picture quality than what you can get from a $6 cable is like spending thousands of dollars on a solid gold USB flash drive inset with diamonds to walk your .JPG files over to Walgreens and expecting this to help you obtain more vivid and lifelike 3x5 prints.The digital content in an HDMI cable does not change between the video player and the TV any more than the .JPG file changes from the time you copy it from your computer onto the flash drive to the time you copy it over to the print kiosk at Walgreens. Anyone telling you otherwise is trying to bilk you out of your hard-earned money, or is trying to convince themselves that they weren't imbeciles for wasting theirs."
3,Will Prolong Your Television Life,"Yes, I have read the reviews about the ones and zeros getting there regardless of the cable type. It either works or it doesn't. However, I disagree. With this cable, when the ones and zeros get there, they are much stronger and cleaner. This will make your television last much longer because it doesn't have to filter out all of the impurities in the signal, which over time can build up in the electronics and cause premature failure.However, I had to take two stars off of the rating because there just isn't enough bling on it to accurately represent its quality. How could you not add some diamond studding to the connector grips?"
1,no good,"i was very dissapointed on how this is written , not a single illustration and just plain context, For what it costs and what its for could improve alot"
2,The DVD quality was good but. . .,The concert quality was great however the content was not so great. Peter was quite vain and the concert kind of left a bad taste in my mouth.
5,The best of Will Smith,"There really nothing to say, Will's work has always be good. I still think hes the best out there, and always will be. He can be the best rapper and actor out there and wouldn't have to try very hard. I am not only saying that because I am his #1 fan, but because its true,and theres still more to come."
5,Awesome as usual :),"At first when I heard about this book, I didn't think it'd be as good as her others because it wasn't fiction, but being that Francesca Lia Block is my favorite author, I bought it anyway. I read the whole thing last night, and I don't have any problem admitting that I was completely wrong about my first assumption. This book is her best yet. It's so touching the way she talks about her daughter and her new life as a mother. It's deffinately a book you want to own a copy of."
4,Love the Seat,This seat has been wonderful. We installed it right before leaving on a big trip. My daughter loves it. She has plenty of room and she adores the cup holders. She actually fell asleep in it on the way home and she never sleeps in the car. We transitioned from the Britaz Marathon to this seat. My only complaint is that the seat belt catches on the seat belt guide when the back is installed. Nothing major. It just takes an extra second or two to get her buckled in. This seat was highly rated by consumer reports and now I know why.
4,Attractive and easy to use,"My kids have had these seats for 1 1/2 years and they function well, they're sturdy, and easy to move in and out of the car."
5,Great seat!,"My local Wal Mart had this for sale for only $39.99, HOWEVER, Amazon offered free shipping, and that meant I didn't have to make a special trip to Walmart, so it was worth the extra $10 to me. My daughter loves the seat!"
4,Graco TurboBooster Safe Seat Fairy Tales,"The Graco TurboBooster Safe Seat in Fairy Tales was easy to put together and install. My daughter is proud to be out of the car seat and into a booster. She is 3 1/2 and her best friends are 6 yr. old twins, all three like it because it's pink and girlie. I like the design, ease of use, and safety features. I do remind my daughter to sit up straight, and she is mature enough to do so. I'm very happy with this purchase,"
1,Not Worth the Price,"Don't let the name ""Streamlight"" deceive you. The two levels of green LED's are helpful when packing up hunting items in the woods or preparing to climb a tree. However, the lens, especially with the white light, causes the light to disperse into a huge circle, filled with numerous shadows and dark spots. This is especially true for the center, which is usually where the most direct light is needed. I DO NOT recommend purchasing this light. I would have returned it but hunting season was starting and I didn't have time. Save your money and purchase either a Princeton Tec Predator Pro or some other type of headlamp."
3,Decent light but I wanted more brightness,"I like the green but it is a very low lumen. It will allow you to navigate on foot at night but a bit more light would be better. The two white led's are about 18 lumens and pretty bright and nice. The Xenon long range is terrible. The light is dull and yellowish in color. I ended up keeping this light to use around the house for grilling and home projects but retired it after one use for hunting. I ordered the more powerful trident HP buckmaster, which i suspect will be perfect. Of course, it cost twice as much at almost $40 vs. $20 for the regular trident."
4,GREAT carafe,"I decided to re write the entire review. I love this carafe. It is larger than the original, but still fits the base of the blendtek and the lids to the smaller carafe. The large wide shape does pull whatever you are blending down into the blades much more quickly. I never bother to chop greens, they are blended up with ease. Dry ingredients are also blended with more speed than the smaller carafe. If given the choice I would choose this size over the original size.I did have one leak on me. I called customer service and it was replaced within 2 days. They included a return label for the leaking carafe. So it was taken care of quickly and efficiently. I now fully trust that any problems I would ever have will be resolved without issue.I do recommend just ordering from Blendtek themselves as their prices are better and they ship quickly. Plus they have a record of your order in case you need assistance.BPA free now too!"
4,Enjoyed this one.,"Another great book in the ""temple"" series. Penczak recommends taking a year to complete all the exercises in the book. Perhaps because I am already a practicing Witch, I don't see how it could possibly take that long. Also, Penczak is very generic in his books and does not teach a particular path, but witchcraft in general. Recommended."
5,Media myths bye-bye,"This book quickly disposes of the stereotype of the pregnant teenager, that way solely because of her (presumed) ""immaturity"". It also shows (or reminds) us that ""teen"" pregnancies usually involve ""men"" over 18 and well into their 20s.The book also shows that ""teen"" (read above) pregnancies are not as evenly spread throughout society as many would like to believe. Socioeconomic standing, race, family structure, and sexual/physical/emotional abuse all factor into ""teen"" pregnancies."
3,Mixed Feelings,"Replaced an Alpine 18wx4 amp with the Power Acoustik OV4-600 to push my Kenwood 6x9's and Kenwood 6.5's. While I like the features and like the price, there is just something missing. I really expected a boost to my speaker performance because I knew I was underpowered. Well, I got a little more volume but I think the bass output is actually weaker. I think this would be a decent amp to push your midrange and tweeters but I seriously question the 70x4rms @ 4ohms power output that the manufacturer boasts. It's really a good value for the money but I would, at the very least, move up to the 800 if I had it to do again (if not consider a different brand).Also, I never received the 20ft cable that Amazon advertises with this amp and their customer service has failed to resond to my inquiry. Caveat emptor."
1,amp,I should have read this feedback before I made my purchase. If i am not happy with this product this will be my last purchase from amazon.com or if I dont get my 20ft cable. Customer service here is terrible. I thought ebay was bad but atleast someone from ebay contacted me.
3,Ryrie Study Bible,"The Bible was purchased as new, but it was used, with a dedication label and verses marked inside. The Bible was a gift. It is an excellent Bible resource, but disappointing as not as advertised."
2,Hansel and Gretel English - in Australia,"The Australian version of this opera is live and as such is riddled with foot scuffles and movement of the like. The orchestra is excellent and more fluid than the performances of the singers which are more rigid than I tend to enjoy of the German versions. The end of ACT I postlude is completely lacking in a choir which is odd as the CD indicates there was one in the opera, this is a great disappointment. Ultimately this is the only current English version available and so I recommend you get it. But try out some German samples for although you may not understand it completely if you do not speak German, this opera is phenomenal and worth your meditation of ""filling in the blanks""."
2,Fair Performances- Horrible Recording,"This recording has no stereo soundstage, It sounds to me that they put up one omni-directional mic, and pressed record.Unfortunely this is the only English version readily available.I have a cassette version of Sadler's Wells-EMI recording from 1964 that is better than all versions....I hope some day it will be remastered, and released. Until this is the only English version I've been able to find, except the Met's 1980's video.ADDENDUM: November 2003 The Sadler's Wells Version HAS been re-released and backs what I said earlier."
1,GOD HAS LEFT THE BUILDING,"As an ex-Christian (Jesus and I had a misunderstanding about the baby, so we called it quits), I believe I am the most qualified to review this album. First of all, my beautiful brain is not about to indulge in such shady, conceited lyrics. My divorce brought me to a realization (besides the fact that Jesus is loaded from the royalties): aliens are not the solution. A sunflower and a rose are not meant to be breeded as one flower. There phylum is not classified in the same genus. I think (yes, I am a woman who can THINK) that my period will be knocked out of whack by this crazy album. THANK YOU!!!!"
2,pro lady,the cover is excellent that is the two star rating the rest of the book doesn't carry enough information to make you a solid player like he stated it's not recommended
1,SHOULD BE RE-TITLED AS: RUST!,"I enjoy good music of any kind, but this ""Tracey-good-ol'-boy"" cd lacks polish and lustre. Hammy lyrics, and tired, worn out grooves and guitar riffs coupled with basic sound production, equals one boring colection of stiff songs.Adkins needs to run alongside a few of the veteran singer-songwriters out there and brush up on his style. A couple more years on the road will give him more experience....."
4,For True Fans...,"As a big fan of Carlos Vives, I will admit this is not his greatest CD. I still think ""Classicos de la Provincia"" will forever be his best recording. However, if you are a true fan, this CD is a must. He continues to improve on his writing skills, both musically and lyrically. From the opening song ""Dejame Entrar"" he displays his talent for a beautiful, yet simple lyric. Other great songs are ""Carito"" (showing his english skills), and my personal favorites ""Amor Latino"" and ""Santa Elegia"". All in all, this is a really good CD. I recommend it to anyone who likes Carlos or vallenato."
4,carlos vives,This music is very adictive. I can't stop listening to it. I have put the cd on my alarm clock and it is wonderful to wake up to.Even if you are not a fan of latin music you should try Carlos Vives and you might become one.
5,All this and a large pizza,I have nothing more to add to the positive reviews. An excellent tool and I appreciate the detail that many folks put into their reviews.
4,Why did I wait so long to buy this?,"I needed a bench grinder, bought a Delta GR450. For tools and drills. Awful! Heavy vibrations, tool rests hit wheels. Brought it back a day later. (Nice Post/Western tool store nearby gave me my money back.)I knew research would be required for a grinder so I bought, on impulse, the DD750 Drill Bit Sharpener. Wow! With my failing eyesight -- I'm 63 -- it's much easier than a bench grinder.For 33 years I did drills by hand on the bench grinder. I do like this tool.Missed 5-stars because of difficulty with short bits, e.g., sharpened broken bits. A simple rubber tube to extend the bit shank out of the chuck might solve the problem.Still have to field sharpen bits with an electric drill 4"" wheel from time-to-time.One last note: I bought it retail in CA $139.99+tax=$151.89.So much for impulse shopping. Next time I'll check the web first."
2,Not what I expected,"I ordered the Drill Doctor 750. I ordered it even though the 500 was about $30 cheaper, but since the Drill Doctor 750 came with a 17 piece bit set, I figured for $30 more I would get a set of drill bits as well as the higher model.I was surprised to see when it arrived that the 17 piece bit set was not drill bits, but rather screwdriver bits. I have dozens of those.....so I returned the 750 and ordered the 500. I made the assumption that by ordering a DRILL Doctor that I would receive DRILL bits, not screwdriver bits.The product itself never left the box before I returned it, so I cannot attest to it's value or worth.Need to change the wording in the ad so others are not mislead as I was."
5,great buy,got this in the mail and sharpen all my old drill bit 40 of them in just 30 min. works great
4,Made in the USA ?....but not all of it!!!!,"I dropped and broke an older model and couldn't find parts (hint there)so I bought a new Drill Doctor. It came with the hardest, stiffest electric cord; absolute piece of shee-shee! I can't put the tool any further than 2 feet from an outlet because the cord will not relax. The cord actually pulls the tool across my steel topped bench. I warmed it up but it never went slack! The memory in the snake-like cord makes it almost impossible to return the tool to the storage case. A very bad place to economize quality. I relish some stifness in my life but not in my Drill Doctor cord! I will replace the cord so I can enjoy the tool. The DVD instructions send me to the manual for ""further instructions""; duh?"
1,Bad,The unit came with the wrong parts and I cannot use it. It was so filthy it took me a while to clean it uphen I discovered the part problem and then it was to late to send it back. I am out 80 some bucks.
1,Dr Doctor doesn't work,"I received the DRILL Dr, and was all excited,the problem is it doesn't work. I called customer service alot and all I ever get is a recording. I'm not happy with the product or the service."
5,very good,"all you need to sharp your drills! best system on market,and i tryed many others before this!fast and easy to handle"
3,eh..,"Corben has many flaws as a writer, though he is talented at creating a complex maze of a mystery. His characters are undeveloped and inconsistent-- examples include the seemingly pure evil Ghost and the love interest in this book. He often obfuscates his plot by simply withholding details that characters know, and the world his book takes place in is a fantastical one with no parralels with the real world-- despite the story's tabloid setting. He will keep you hooked, but dont overthink the motivations and emotions of the characters involved: more often then not they dont make any snese at all."
4,Gone for good will not me Gone for good from your memory,"Gone for Good will not soon leave your memory files. This book will not be Gone for Good it will say with you. His previous book Tell No One was the best mystery book i read in years so I was somewhat worried to read his newest book. Somehow this author has created 2 excellent who done it page turners. I started reading this book Saturday morning and did not put it down until I finished it. To me, that is the best adventure in reading I could ever wish for."
5,I have betrayed you most!,"This book was really great to read. Did he do it? No? Mystery woman, girl, man.....who did it???? Why is ""The Ghost"" seeminly on our hero's side? or is he?Excellent mystery!"
2,I miss Myron,"I've loved all of Coben's other novels, but this was a disappointment. I thought the characters were implausible and the plot strained. My book club picked this for their summer beach read and we split about 50/50 over this title."
2,What's the fuss about,"The characters are not believable. None of them. The herois so weak one wonders how it is that two 'beautiful' womenfell in love with him. Publishing has become a game of 'Names'and Hype. If you must read this book, do what I did. Get itfrom your local library. Thank me later..."
2,"Same plot, different characters","This is exactly the same premise and plot as ""Tell No One"", complete with the ueber-psycho hit man, a girlfriend who works with the homeless (really!), and a totally benevolent, gotta-love-him main character. Both of them were reasonably enjoyable page turners, but it was hard to enjoy what was essentially the same story. My best advice would be to pick one or the other (and they're both equally implausible, so flip a coin) and then don't read the other one."
3,Not too good,"I was unpleasantly surprised at this book because I waited so long after reading Tell No One, which I loved, for this to come out.My opinion is that the author has way too many characters in this book to keep track of. It became a chore to read while trying to remember who was who. It was fun however to read about Livingston, NJ as I am from West Orange! I'll still try his next one."
3,Very so so,"I don't think I have ever given a three star to any book. Most either I love or hate. But this one truly deserves a 3 star. About 10 pages from the end, when the story was climaxing to an extremely predictable end, I put the book away not bothering to see if there would be a earth shattering, mind boggling, drop-jawed, shocking twist. I didn't care. The characters are so boring, either perfect or totally EVIL. They don't feel real. I did not care about Will, Shiela or the Ghost. I hope Will is the bad guy in the end, although I didn't finish the book so I don't really know.This is a bad adventure novel, a lousy romance novel and a poor detective novel."
4,Entertaining Escape,"Here is a book filled with mystery and intrigue. We enter the story from the point of view of Will Klein, a man for who tragedy seems to be following. He has just lost his mother to cancer and has had to deal with the disappearance and probably death of his brother, Ken, after he was accused of murdering Will's ex-girlfriend.Harlan Coben sets the story up very nicely, passing Will's beliefs to us as if they were facts, which meant that every time Will was surprised by an unexpected turn of events, I was surprised right along with him.For entertainment value, I thought Gone For Good certainly delivered. It's a fast-paced story with your standard heartless killers as the bad guys, up against a nice-guy protagonist, who describes himself as a coward, working against the odds and his own self doubts to try to overcome them."
4,Very Entertaining,"This is one of those books you don't want to put down, very entertaining and suspenseful! I loved the twist at the end of the book.I will definitely read another Coben book,this was my first."
5,KMK bumps this s**t yet again!,"The Kottonmouth Kings are back yet again with a new cd-big deal? HELL YEAH! This cd is probably their best yet. It isn't as long as High Society, but it still doesn't dissapoint. HS2-Kream of the Krop is still over 60 minutes long. They have Dog Boy back for 2 tracks, the Humble Gods for 2 tracks and The JUDGE on ""Killa Kali""-in my opinion, the best song on the album.No big rappers like ICP or Sen Dog on this one, but the Krew is better than ever. On track 10, D-Loc gets on the sensitive side, a damn good song. The whole cd is playable and KMK doesn't let down on their 3rd full length.-I'm Out-"
3,"Beware, I got a Ryobi","I ordered this through Amazon - well - an affiliate of theirs, I guess, and what I got was a Ryobi brand trimmer with a curved shaft. I was desperate at the time, so tried it out and am actually very happy with it. I don't know if Ryobi makes trimmers anymore, but given the bad review of this one, you might want to look for a Ryobi."
1,Damaged and kinda cheap,"The carton came damaged from the shipper. But beyond that, it was packaged damaged from the seller. When we unpacked it looking for any damage, the wrapped pieces inside were bent. There was no way it was a shipping issue. It is pretty bad that quality control would let bent and warped metal through to packaging. I was also unimpressed with the weight of the metal. It was cheap, and I doubted it would last past one season. I opted to return and not seek a replacement."
1,Question,I am here because I can't find anywhere else to ask a question.What are the licensing implications of buying a copy of WordPerfect Office 11 from jmurray36 for 49.95? This appears to be the same package that normally sells new for $249.00. How come? What is missing. How can it be sold for this price?
5,Word Perfect,"This is a great word processing program. Quite easy to work with and much simpler than Microsoft Word in my opinion. I have worked with Word Perfect programs for over 20 years and although they are somewhat different, they are easily learned and incorporated into the program you have been using."
5,Pleasantly Surprised!!,"Ok, so, yes, I'm a BIG Matchbox20 fan! And, I have to admit that I would never have looked up Tabitha's Secret had it not been for MB20! But I LOVE this CD! I think it is probably my all time favorite MB20/TS recording! It's real and a little bit raw. Songs like ""Here Come Horses""...Oh, and ""Forever December"". Awh! (listen to 'em loud, it's the best!!!) And yes, wait for dizzy! Perfection!! Really, lots a good stuff!!! Be sure to check out other slices like ""Paint Me Blue"", and ""Dear Joan"", ""High"", and ""Tired""! All in all...I am VERY HAPPY with this purchase!!! These guys rock!! These guys rule!"
4,A Tale of Two Tours,"Despite a feeling of something lost in translation, I highly recommend Buzzati's tale of the '49 Giro to anyone interested in Italy, cycling, sports journalism or even World War Two. The book takes the reader the length of Italy from Sicily to the Alps, giving a lyrical look at life in post-war Italy and at times pushing the race into secondary importance. But the race is indeed the story and as a cycling fan I found that the author, who personally admits to a certain ignorance of the sport, had an insight into the race that an aficionado might have overlooked. If you like a mix of fact and fiction, muscle-ache and metaphor, mountain stage heroics and their Homeric interpretations then this is the book for you."
4,Great Value,"You can hardly go wrong with this version at this price. The principals are in marvellous voice, especially Ricciarelli and Carreras. The one trouble is that this is a very ""live"" recording. The closest miking in the recording is of some people with very juicy coughs. Apparently the same individuals -- at least ones as closely miked -- also tended to cover final notes with clapping or roars of Bravo. Despite this, it is a very exciting recording which I anticipate enjoying again and again"
1,Renee The Atavus Slayer,"This is what the show should have been re-named, ""Renee The Atavus Slayer"", because all the story lines are basically the same thing: Renee trying to hunt down and kill these vampire-like aliens (similar to Buffy The Vampire Slayer). So many things about this season didn't even make sense I don't know where to begin, but one which I thought was pretty obvious is: how does the Taelon mothership manage to stay in orbit for a whole year if it had no core energy left and it got nuked? At the end of Season 4 we are told the ship is in a decaying orbit, which means it should be crashing into the atmosphere sometime soon."
2,Funny?,"Shucks folks, I don't mean to put a damper on things here, but honestly I didn't find a joke in this book that I thought was funny. I don't want to sound mean in the least, but I was very disappointed when opening the book to find out that the jokes contained didn't make me laugh. Then I thought about the money I spent on it, and it made it even harder for me to laugh. Now, I'm not boasting when I say I am a truly funny guy. But this is not funny. :(This is funny: Did you hear about the Amish couple that got a divorce? He was driving her buggy. :) Now, that's funny. I didn't find a joke like that in the book. Is this book some kind of a joke?"
2,Junkyard Script.,"I watched this yesterday and thought it was entertaining, but not very good. The dialog was the worst, the acting unbelievably bad. Come on, Vivica, you can do better than this! Sorry to say, but the dog was the best actor in the entire film. I'm not an expert on serial killers, but I would think he would have killed the girl longer ago than he did for all the trouble she caused him. I'll throw it a bone, so to speak, and say that the movie succeeded in being gross and disturbing. Other than that, I found the entire scenario hard to swallow, much like his ""dinners,"" and the only one I felt any real emotional bond with was the dog. That's saying something right there. Watch it if you want, but if you think this movie is anywhere close to good where serial killers are concerned, this must be the first one you've ever seen."
5,Emmy's mom,"I bought this to go with my dreamer design jogging stroller and was not disapointed! Their products are great and they offer top notch customer service! I thought this would be nice for fall to keep the baby warm while I walked, it fits easily into the stroller and has soft warm fleece on the inside and water-protectant covering on the outside.Very easy to remove if not needed and also has a pocket on the outside that you could fit small items in. If you are a walker, jogger or are outside alot, this product is for you!!!"
5,Mind and brainclocks,"Imagine that we could perceive all the happy and sorrow moments of our lives without expressing our feeling, being able to prevent painful events or to hug our loved ones. Perception without action is just a bad construction! In this lovely book, the author presents us the brain's solution: evolve action strategies first and use perceptions and watchful predictions to control them. We are taken through an exciting journey of contemporary neuroscience and learn the building elements of brainworks, the heart of which is endogenously generated oscillations. These tidal waves (guess who rides on their vortex!) provide the context for everything we feel and act upon. So how do we get from here to what really interests all of us, our cognitive mind? Just read on and you'll get the answer! Convincing? It depends what you accept as proof. All I guarantee is that you walk away with argument that will make you think about our existence for a while. A good book."
4,Love it but...,"I absolutely adore this product -- especially the ceiling ""light show"" and the volume settings. My only complaint is that the motor is loud, so the lowest volume setting is kind of obsolete (in other words, if you have the music volume on low, the sound of the motor drowns out the music). I haven't heard anyone else complain about this though, so maybe it's just me?"
5,LIFE SAVER,"This is the best!! My daughter was sleeping well since 8 weeks old until she started teething her top teeth. She was waking up 8 times a night and only wanted to sleep with us. After reading numerous books on babies sleeping habits, I had determined the only way to keep her in her crib and to sleep through the night was to put her to bed while she was still awake. This soother made it happen. Now, 2 months later she is not only sleeping through the night, she smiles at me when I put her in the crib. Within minutes of watching and listening to the little birdies, she falls asleep happy!!!! No crying!!! As a parent of a teething baby you cannnot ask for more than that. Thank you Fisher Price!"
2,Great when it works,"My son loved this toy. However, we have gone through 2 of them in 6 months b/c they just stop working! I won't buy a third!"
4,A Hard Short Life,"The pages of this fine book are filled with Men who spit in the face of Death. And die they do. I was amazed they could even accomplish their missions thru out their history. Malaria,bad food and water,brutal beatings, capital punishment,not to mention men with spears, muskets,cannons, rifles and machine guns killing them. Their march across Madagascar, cutting their way thru the jungle and lining it with their own graves was a hell of a read. Great book."
5,squirrel proof...oil,"this is the best stuff I've found, tho not perfect, closer to working to keep the seeds in the feeder than anything I've found to date."
4,Solid switching at a reasonable price,"I've been very pleased with this device after using it for a few months to switch between a Dell 8300 and Dell XPS 630 connected to a 24"" monitor (1920x1200 looks fine). The box has everything required to connect the systems, the Switcher is easy to set up, and works as advertised.The two minor issues I've come across are that1) My Logitech MX600 cordless mouse is ""jumpy"". I may just get one mouse for each system as the problem only occurs when the USB Receiver is plugged into the Switcher.2) Swapping back to the 8300 is slow (5+ seconds) but I suspect that's due to the 8+ USB devices attached to it...I'd highly recommend the 2X1 to anyone looking for a 2 system Dvi KVM in the Gefen price range."
3,Not as good as I was hoping.,It's quite a bit more vinegary than I'd hoped. It's kind of hard to taste the tomatoes over the vinegar and forget it with the garlic. I don't use it on salads because of that. But I do use it as a marinade and it works great.
5,Our favorite!,This salad dressing has solved our problem. My husband likes very salty dressings and I less salty but flavorful. This dressing is a combination of the two and we love it. We bought it from Safeway but can no longer find it anywhere except online. It is worth trying!
1,These didn't work right from the start,The spring that is supposed to reopen the blades after each cut never functioned correctly. They are useless.
4,Excellent introduction,"This is by far the best introduction to Arabic music I've read in English. It is restricted in its scope and certainly doesn't cover all Arabic music. If like me you're interested in the rather more limited world of 'traditional music' (my interest is in the 'ud) or simply want to know how Arabic music works rather than gain an overview of artists and styles, this is the first book I'd recommend.I can also recommend the newMusic in Egyptas a general intro to traditional Arabic music, with an excellent description of maqams and a CD of examples included too."
3,Not for the faint of heart...,"Touma excels in some areas but falls well short of providing a good foundation for an introductory survey book. The book can be very informative but requires the reader to really invest themselves in the book. Touma, however, puts together a very good listening example section and the accompanying CD is very good."
2,Excellent book--very poor condition.,"This is such a cute book. I saw it at the library, and since I am reading the ""Little House"" series aloud to my 8 year old girl and 5 year old boy, I thought this would be an added bonus. It has a lot of information, and a lot of fun recipes from the books.Unfortunately, I am very grateful I only paid a small amount for this used book, as the library edition was in far greater condition that this book. Not only does this appear water damaged, somebody marked a bunch of pages with sticky notes. Not a great sin, but rather than remove them and risk tearing the water damaged pages, they just tore off the parts of the sticky notes that were sticking out of the book, and left the rest of the sticky notes with ragged edges, still attached. Very poor condition...which was NOT what I paid for. I will definitely stay away from this seller!"
5,Alphabet Stories: Puppets and Picture Stories that Teach Letter Recognition,I have used this book for over 25 years with my preschoolers. Still very interesting to them today..fixing to retire and will give this to my best friend & co-worker. Highly recommend for any preschool teacher.
3,Got what I ordered!,Seller got this to me in good time. Sadly I ordered the wrong version but this one was pretty good.
1,"Terrible, simply terrible","Hard to follow. Majot parts of the book left out. And can ANYONE tell me what a SAXOPHONE is doing playing a prominent musical part in a movie set in the 19th century???? God, it was terrible..."
2,northanger abbey,"I have watched almost all the jane austen movies, pride and prejudice, sense and sensibility, emma, and mansfield park. I have loved each of these and have and will watch them over and over. This Northanger Abbey was not as much like her other stories. It has a little darkness in its story line, something I am not accustomed to seeing in Jane Austen stories. I must say I will not be watching this one again."
2,Disappointing!,"This novel is my least favorite of Austen's work. However, I did expect to pleased when I sat to watch this video. I was thoroughly disappointed. This film was just plain silly."
1,Avoid at all cost,"A horrible movie of this great Austen novel. Bad performances, awful music and cliché acting. Don't buy it."
2,This was a dud,"I really love all of Jane Austens Novels, and I have seen other BBC/A&E productions of her other books. This was by far the worst Jane Austen movie I have seen. It was not very enjoyable at all. A few parts were acctually gross. I would not reccomend this to anyone!"
1,Choose a different version!,"I adore most BBC productions but this film was absolutely horrid! Although the casting was appropriate, the production and music make the film almost embarrassing to watch."
3,not your typical Austen theme,"the DVD did not work completely on my friend's DVD player, playing about 1/3., then reverting to the beginning"
2,"Read the book,instead,please!!","You have no idea how the book is better(ok,probably you have)comparing to this film!the actors are fine,Katharine Schlesinger plays Catharine Morland well,but i found the script to be very strange(those flashback scenes,that was unnecessary)and a bit confusing(if you haven't read the novel first you'll be confuse about their feelings)and they made modifications from the book.Let's hope that BBC make another satisfying Northanger Abbey in the future..."
3,"Okay, but not GRAND!","I was a bit surprised at the movie. The musical score was intended to highlight the gothic-horror imaginings of the heroine, but I found it irritating and disruptive at times.The screenplay took too many liberties with dialogue, and the characters were over-done (Isabella, for example, bared her teeth throughout and was in no way charming).Perhaps if I hadn't read the book half a dozen times, it would have pleased me more?"
5,Jane Would have approved,"This production of Austen's best satire gets the author's meaning across and is entertaining, beautiful and well-acted. The 20th century music offends some purists (which I usually am) but I liked it and thought it didn't detract from the wonderful acting or Austen's extraordinary story. My favorite part is the final scene when Henry Tillney comes to propose to Catherine. It is easy to see in the young woman's eyes that she is wondering if he is real or just another of her novel-inspired fantasies. Wonderful!!!"
4,The last scene makes it all worth while!,"Northanger Abbey was the only Jane Austen book that I never read, having been told that it was boring and not worth my time. Therefore, I hesitated to see the movie, but once it started I couldn't stop it! I enjoyed it-- oh! so much! The character of Catherine Moreland with her wild imagination was delightful, reminding me so much of myself it was unreal. While the entire things was marvelous, the last scene was the best. As gorgeous Henry Tillney rides up through the mist, as he says beautiful things to Catherine such as ""since you left us the white rose bushes died of grief,"" as a tear trickles down Catherine's cheek, and as they kiss-- the most pure, passionate kiss I've ever seen on film-- well, when it's over, you'll be on a high for the rest of the day. If only ALL romances were like that!"
2,Cover your ears,You forget how important sound is to a film until you've heard it done badly. The music is so horrible that it ruins the entire film.
1,Boring & Wooden,"I am an avid reader and love most of the books written by Jane Austen. This version of Northanger Abbey was very disappointing. Having been moved to tears by other excellent movie adaptations of Jane Austen stories (Persuasion w/Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root, Sense & Sensibility w/Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet, Emma w/Gwyneth Paltrow); This rendition of Northanger Abbey left me diappointed, confused, and mad at myself for wasting money to rent the video.The acting left much to be desired. It seemed awkward and stilted. I absolutely hated the actor's portrayal of Catherine. She was the most irritating of all. Her attempts at ""wide-eyed innocence"" came across as ""space-out stupidity."" The cuts between fantasy/dream sequences and reality were reminiscent of B-movies. This was a total waste of time and money. Until someone makes a decent movie adaptation of Northanger Abbey, please just read the book."
3,Not his best work,"""Dreamtime Return"" is a much better album. I guess this is why this album sells so cheap. A lot of the music simply is not very distinctive from his other works - combining a bit of australian inspired music and some other music that sounds space. Now I will admit there are 2 or 3 tracks that are good.. but not exceptional.."
3,"Decent, not great","Space and Time is somewhat different than I expected. I am looking for more of a space melody, something that suggests an engaging story, and this seemed more like background noise with little action. Didn't seem compelling at all, and really didn't hold my interest."
4,Great product,"This is a great quality product, but can be a little hard to get back into its original shape if you don't roll it tight enough."
5,FOOTBALL,"It is always cold and wet during my daughters games, this is perfect.. keeps me warm and dry. I keep it in my car for emergency, and it is very durable"
1,It says on the blanket not machine washable...,Ok I bought this just because it said it was machine washable on the description and on the blanket it says not to put in washer.
3,Nice but could have been better.,They did mostly other groups songs and only one of they own.But i guess it was okay they did sound good.
4,Signing made easy,I found this tape a great addition to my other sign language tape. The main character(anthony natale)adds humor as he teaches the viewer american Sign Language. Mr.natale does an excellent job showing everyday life through a deaf persons eyes. It's a beginners tape;great for exploring sign language.
2,Very dissapointing quality,"Bosch PB10-CD Advanced Power Job Site Radio with CD Player and Remote ControlI received my package yesterday, took it to my shop and hooked it up. I have never been so disappointed. The sound quality was very poor, the speakers buzzed at low volume when the radio was tuned to a music station. Speaker buzz diminished somewhat when a CD was playing which suggests to me the buzzing was in the receivers circuitry. I have purchased many Bosh tools but their radio is at the other end of the quality spectrum. I give it two thumbs down. I just wasted over $200.00 If you are thinking of buying a job site or shop radio, buyer be ware......"
1,mine is broken,"It worked OK when it did work. The CD player didn't work when it was freezing out (I'm talking 0 degrees). The reception on the radio stunk. I tried everything. Finally it stopped working after a year and a half, just in time for the warranty to expire. The Bosch repair center wouldn't even try to fix it. They said all they could do is sell me a reconditioned one at a discounted rate which it about the same amount Amazon has it on sale for. It was never abused, in fact, I am so anal with my tools I still have my 1st set of power tools that I started with 23 years ago. Of coarse I have updated them since then but I am just making a point. I own the Bosch cordless kit and that's why I purchased it. If I were to do it again I would go either DeWalt or Milwaukee. Hope I didn't disappoint you."
3,Great CD player and step stool,"I have had mine for over a year and am only dissapointed with the FM radio reception. I use it every day in some very dusty and dirty conditions and it never misses a beat. I listen to CD-R that get pretty scratched up and dirty but they still play. The best part of the radio is the 12 volt recptical that I plug my X-M Roady into, I then get over 100 stations to listen to."
5,Must have for Ludwig Fans,"This is the only version available of Ludwig's assumption of this role, and it is a must have. She has a rich and powerful dramatic mezzo to bring to the role, dramatic and acting ability to spare, and she simply is gripping in every aspect of the role. The Macbeth himself boasts Milnes, to my mind the greatest singer of the role in all studio recordings, here captured at his best. The sound quality is excellent and there are few irritations associated with some ""live"" recordings. The Callas version is still unique, but here the sound quality is better. Verret does wonderfully as well in studio, but Ludwig sent my spine tingling. Yes she does not sing the high D-flat at the end of the sleep-walking scene, but what she does with this scene is worth a lot more. I am glad I did not miss this one."
2,An odd live recording of a great opera,"Macbeth is one Verdi opera that you would want to own on CD--it's not performed too often. But this recording is a disappointment.It is a very strange ""live"" recording with the music interrupted by tepid applause that sounds like the stage hands were the only people around. So the applause takes up space on the disc without adding to any real sense of excitement.Christa Ludwig's performance is unpleasing. While she can belt out the tunes with the best of them, there's not a high note that she doesn't slide into and get to eventually. A much better Lady MacBeth with a fantastic range is Shirley Verrett on the Domingo/Abbado recording.And Karl Bohm's conducting makes Verdi sound like Viennese minuets--a strange feat, but not endearing for this Italian opera. All in all, quite disappointing."
4,Warped humor and beautiful sentiments,"This album starts perversely, and goes back and forth between perverse urban humor and sincere emotions, all with memorable images and melodies that linger in your mind, and come back to haunt you at odd hours. Eric's voice is rich and powerful, and full of spirit, soul, and intensity. Not necessarily an album to be played all at once, but one to be played over and over."
5,GREAT Lopper,"If you need a lopper, this is the one. Great quality light weight and cuts everything....love it!!!"
5,Best of the genre,"I bought this e-book at face value, knowing nothing about it. I found it to be captivating. Most Victorian erotica is of the (if you will pardon the crudeness) ""slam-bam-""...well, you know the rest. And, indeed, volume 1 is like that, though a bit better written. Volume 2, however, is a different matter entirely. The erotica is contained within a well written story. Except for the all too sudden and contrived ending (the author had intended a third volume, which evidently exists only in manuscript form somewhere in England), this is the best example of this particular genre of literature that I've read. The story line has its weaknesses and inconsistencies, but overall it is well worth reading, the type of book that you are not ready to see it come to an end."
5,well done all way 'round,"A good overview of the wild universe of music out there related to Gong; excellent production and liner notes; no skimping on the packaging; and I finally have ""Opium for the People"" on CD instead of just vinyl. What more could you want? ;-)ps. album is set up so that all the songs run one into the next, which makes for nice holistic listening experience that works well for space music like this. If you had to have just one Gong release, this would be it."
2,cast iron grill,this grill did not meet my requirementsI wanted a grill that was easy clean - this one comes with complicated instructionswe like to use it for defrosting in addition to cooking
2,To repetitive!,"I usually do not write reviews, but must on this book. It is a sweet story, but it is very repetitive, and full of information that has no relation to the haunting the author is describing. I love true ghost stories, and usually read them without putting them down, until this one. I had a hard time getting through this one. The author spends most of her time talking about herself and daily tasks then about the haunting. The only reason I finished this book was because I spent money on it."
3,I give it a C+,"The basis for the story is beautiful--rather than being frightened by the ""spirit children"" in her new home, Kathleen McConnell befriends and becomes a sort of mother to them. However, the writing style is simplistic to say the least--nothing poetic or really creative, it is chock-full of grammatical errors that may or may not have been intentional (lots of ""Me and So-and-so did this..), and the ghostly events that take place would be best saved for campfire fodder. After reading her story, I believe Kathleen may be one of the sweetest people out there, which makes it hard for me to say that unless you LOVE true ghost stories, it is probably best to just let someone else read this one and then tell you about it."
5,Loved it. One of the best read on branding and positioning,"Great book, loved it.Very clearly articulates USP, the importance of differentiation and what could be used to differentiate. A good followup read could be the ""Blue Ocean Strategy"" by Renee Mauborgne."
2,the usual,"While it is great to be reminded of the value of differentiation,the author uses a self congratulatory style which contradicts the fact that most of the stuff has been known for a long time."
2,Disappointed,"This watch was purchased as a Xmas gift. I was expecting to get a high qualitywell known brand name (SEIKO) and the literature seemed to match my expectations.However, although the watch itself seems to be a fairly good timepiece, the linkbracelet that came with the watch is far below the standards that I would expectto be associated with a SEIKO watch. It is cheaply made, diffcult to adjust andsimply painted gold on the TOP of the gold links. It appears to be of very poorquality and is difficult to snap closed . I have seen better quality on TIMEX watch bracelets sold at Wal-Mart for $49.99 ."
1,clasp is horrible,"thought this was the perfect gift for my Mom, but the clasp didn't close properly. you had to forced it closed. I sent it back with no problem and received a replacement with no problems. The Problem is the second watch had the same closure problems. I have to send this one back also. So now it's almost February and couple trips to the post office and still no xmas gift."
3,bldimages,"Nice looking watch, but unfortunately it did not come with an expansion band. My Sweetie wanted an expansion band. I did notice that the calendar was difficult to adjust, I had to read the manual for that to happen. A watch this simple should be more user friendly in setting. Unfortunately I had to return it, I have not found a replacement that looks as nice that has an expansion band."
4,Interesting paper,The paper came unbound as if someone tore a section off a pad and sent it to me. It works however and the printinng looks good.
1,not so tuff!!!,"Let me start by saying the dogs love it. They unwrapped for xmas and w/in 5 min had a hole from the close stitching on loose weave fabric. It is the day after xmas, I have sewed it twice and it is full of thread frays in the fabric and the stitching is giving out faster than I can keep up. The size and shape is good for my small dogs, but this toy does not stand up to the test of excited vigorous play."
1,Transcend 4GB SD card does not work after 1 week on ETEN M600 PDA,"SD card worked fine for a week.Problems arise then worsens over time for one more week then it just doesn't work anymore.Problem is not the PDA, nor software on it. Tried to use the card on a separate flash reader/writer. Tried formatting it to FAT32, create test directory, data stays on for less than one hour.I would refrain from buying this product."
4,Strategy Focus on Airlines and Airports,"Highly relevant and interesting collection of papers, spanning complex and state-of-the-art research by university professors as well as practical insights and evaluations of current industry topics by top industry managers. This well-balanced collection with its clear focus on management and strategy is a highly welcome contribution in an area still dominated by regulatory and economics oriented books.Feat: The sections on air cargo and airport management fill an especially neglected gap in the literature, the section on alliances is excellent.Setback: Some chapters overlap contentswise. Probably an aspect of every edited book, the one or other chapter does not live up to its promises. Comparatively high representation of German authors, low representation of US/CA authors."
3,Blue Magic Review,"Pretty good show. I expected more songs from them (Chasing Rainbows etc:), but overall, the DVD had excellent picture quality, and the sound was excelllent. If you're a fan of Blue Magic, you'll enjoy this DVD"
5,Love it,I bought it for my daughter when she was about 4 months old. If I would of known she was going to love it i would have got it sooner. She had so much fun and kept her very entertained. She outgrew pretty soon. I recomned you buy when baby is 2 months.
1,Choking Hazard!,"I bought this for my four month old. I spent alot of time comparing before purchasing it. I made a mistake! It was cute and seemed to be great, but within the first few minutes my son pulled the bird off. I snaped it back on. The next time he pulled it off,the white ring attached to the back of the bird came off and he put it in his mouth and started chocking! Even with bird broke off of it he enjoys it, however my concern is for the next child that chokes! Would NOT recommend this product."
2,Broken Bird,"My 3 month old son repeatedly removes the bird, it comes off too easily. Today he tugged at a hanging toy and the yellow bar broke. This toy needs some improving."
4,"""Bye Bye Birdie""","I originally received the Ocean Wonders rockin gym, but had a lot of problems with it so I returned it to Babies R Us. They were kind enough to allow me to exchange it for the Flutterbye gym. My son is 3 months old and he absolutely loves it! However, there are some features that needs to be improved, such as: 1.) The arches are attached under the mat by velcro, which makes it hard to move the mat from place to place without it coming detached. 2.) Although the mirror on the mat seemed like a good idea at first it really needs to be removed. My son likes to move around on the mat, especially while on his back, and the mirror has injured him several times. 3.) The bird comes off if pulled hard enough. My son has been able to remove it several times. On the positive side, I like the hanging toys, the satin mat and the musical birdhouse w/ the flying bird. I hope this information has been helpful."
1,Waste of money,"My daughter did not enjoy this. She would play with it for maybe five minutes and then want to do something else. She also pulled the bird off several times at the age of four months, now that is bad. Not very good quality."
2,okay,"My cousins Bailey and Christian are almost 1. when Christian was under the play mat, he kicked the side-pole. All of a sudden the whole thing collapsed on him. Sure, he cried for about 10 minutes, but the birdie still worked. Since it's $40...now you know why. Although when either one of the baby's were cranky my Aunt would put them under it and it would keep them quiet for 10 minutes, which is when the bird stopped you were about to hear noise. Throughout the whole thing it was okay, but mostly bad."
4,Great Headphone Music,"The Verbrilli Sound is not quite like anything else. This CD has some excellent songs. Unlike many in this genre, the music is important - there is actually melody here - and it is not all synth and drum machines. Unfortunately the best Verbrilli Sound song I have heard and one of the best I have heard in the last year - ""riffling in the netherworld"" - is not on this CD and is not otherwise available. What a great headphone song! The music on this CD comes close and is very good in its own right. Hopefully we will hear more from VS in the near future."
4,Nice ash...can.,"It's a simple receptacle with a solar powered LED that provides light for those evening smokes in the car. It becomes a little faint in illuminating after being covered up with the elements of ash, smoke and tar build up (yeah, cigarattes. lovely things, aren't they?), but really - one LED bulb isn't going to light up the thing that much. After a while, it really is just a novelty. Besides, if you're missing the opening of this thing to place your butts and ash in cause you couldn't see into it - roll a window down.But most importantly, it simply fits into a cupholder - large or small. It does its job. It does it well. Designed right and nice height and capacity. Gees, too many words already, just for a ash ""bottle""..."
5,Weight Loss Miracle,I started using this patch a week ago and have lost 4 lbs. I really never feel the urge; I eat because I know I have too :) Im ordering more!
5,Great book!,"I read this book some time ago, and loaned my copy and never got it back. It is one of my books that I no longer have that I sorely miss.This is an outstanding history of the history of Jewish involvement with the confederacy. It was an entirely untold story for me, and I found it fascinating. This is a great book that will serve as the reference for future works on the topic.I would be interested in follow ups to this book, covering other minority groups/faiths and their involvement with the confederacy. One that looks interesting is:Irish Confederates: The Civil War's Forgotten SoldiersAn excellent addition to the literature."
5,I Dare You to Read My Review --- I Love this CD!,"Have you heard this CD? Each song stands alone on it's own merit. After probably wearing the CD thin, I still have not been able to narrow down a favorite. But, if you are looking for romantic mood music, then you can't go wrong with ""Let Me Say I Love You"". ""Backroads"" let the miles pass with a little more ease. ""Autobiography to Jack"" sounds like that old classic that you just can't put your finger on. If Jimmy Buffet hasn't heard ""Things Jimmy Never Sang About"", he needs to. ""The Eagle..."" is definitely a testament to American Pride.Can you tell I really like the CD? You will too, my friend!"
4,I give it four stars because of the effort.,"A Love Noire tells the story of the ""love"" Between Innocent and Noire, two completely different up and coming buppies. Noire is the bohemian one, Innocent, Noire's man is conservative. Both have some serious issues, which never seem to come completely clear, but the have a bond that is strong.I liked the book since it was written in an intelligent way, but sometimes i would wonder where Ms. Turnipseed was going with her characters. I still do not understand where Noires' brief bi-sexual episode fits in the book (It's not like the Shug Avery/Celie bit in Color Purple--there was at least an explaination regarding that). I also was somewhat annoyed with Noire, since she seemed to have too many hangups. But all in all, I welcomed this book since it was more intelligent than some of the novels I think most writers seem to write these days. I look forward to reading more by Ms. Turnipseed."
2,So how on earth did someone tag this an IR,This is not an IR. Come on people let's do better with the tags for 2009
1,it spits and smells bad - manufacturing problems,"I have used and loved Aveeno Shaving Gels for years. I love the feel on my face, and I have loved the light fragrances. BUT in the last year I have bought it and had problems with FIVE successive purchases! It spits and sends out a smelly gas. Sometimes only gas comes out, sometimes the gel spits out mixed with a metallic smelly gas. Clearly a manufacturing problem. I wrote the company and sent them a bottle, but they only sent me coupons, not answers. I stopped using a favorite product and will not buy more until they admit something is wrong and tell us they fixed it."
5,I love this thing,I bought my Sky Scout on Jun30th and got it on july 8th. It works great it was hard to up date but it worked before and after I love this thing.
1,More Chinese Junk,"Did not work right out of the box. GPS error. I would have sent it back anyway as soon as I saw it was made in China. I try very hard not to buy products made in China and thank you Amazon for the refund. The refund process took a lot less time then getting through to Celestron tech support, which I think was also in Chinese. The guy was definitely not speaking English. I also cancelled the telescope I ordered from them. Chinese junk, pure and simple."
1,JUNKY BEWARE,"Trusting in this company and the reviews, I and some friends naively, excitedly tried to get a gps in my front yard. I live in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, I got the electromagnetic icon indicating magnetic field interference. That makes sense. So, I took the SkyScout out to Blythe, California into the fields, but again, the ole magnetic interference icon. Sooo, I next took the thing out to Joshua Tree National Park, and again, YES, you guessed it, the magnetic interference icon. I guess that explains why the moon was 30 to 90 degrees off!!! Yea, this is really a super tool ! I will mail it back for a refund ASAP, and NO Celestron I do not want to buy a bridge offered in Brooklyn New York.I do not suggest buying a two or three thousand dollar telescope from these people."
3,Clever but not stellar!,"It really sucks batteries, they should have used at least 4 AA cells. The GPS resolution only goes down to minutes, no seconds. It's all plastic and for $400 I expected higher quality. It won't help you find man-made satellites as I suspect the processor is too slow and there is not even a way to display the present elevation and azimuth although it must know them for internal calculations. Updating the firmware is way slow. Under ""Tonight's Highlights"" it may show from the menu that Jupiter for example is visible but when I tried to locate it, it has me point the unit into the dirt since if the object was not above my horizon. Maybe they could highlight menu objects that are truly visible? You're much better off with Starry Night and a laptop."
4,Nice but....,Be advised that the SkyScout only works with 32-bit operating systems; if you use 64-bit XP/Vista you're out of luck.I don't know why Celestron doesn't provide 64-bit drivers; if you want to fully utilize 4GB or more of RAM a 64-bit OS is a must.
5,Amazing technology!,This product blows my mind! Performs FLAWLESSLY! Exactly as promoted by Celestron and MORE!
1,Too many conditions,"We have enough open sky for DirectTV, but apparently not enough for this item to pick up the GPS satellites. I manually entered my latitude and longitude only to get a big M for magnetic interference. Yes, we have electricity and power lines near our house, and this thing won't work with them there. I would have to drive a long way to find an open field. I got this thing for my backyard! If I could see the entire sky, I could figure out where objects are much easier and would not need it so much. I agree it really sucks batteries. I've been through 1 1/2 sets and haven't even gotten to work yet. The store I bought it from has only a seven day return policy, so I can't even send it back. Very disappointed."
3,The Tabloids Are Now Publishing Books,"While JR Watkins did know Em and Kim personally and can therefore speak with some authority on the matters in which she writes about in this book, she allows herself to analyze much more than she should, or than is even necessary. She assumes the readers are too dumb to form their own opinions of the facts and what really went on. She puts so much of her own spin on the facts, that the book begins to lose some merit. Yes, the stories depicted are all very interesting and hold your attention. She is a savvy writer with a gift for words, but she should never have been allowed to take someone's personal life and rip it apart like this. She put a very complicated story, one which the people involved have trouble talking about because emotions blur the edges, out on the shelves and tied it up in a neat little package, making everything look so cut and dry. She implies more than she should."
3,She's pretty transparent,"I don't think JR Watkins is an utter goldigging skank or anything,,but it's pretty obvious she had an affair with him and got angry when he wouldn't take it ""to the next level"". Maybe he did use her as a free babysitter,,,but she allowed it. She was Kim Mathers friend for years but turns around and backstabs her like this to millions of readers?? Doesn't say too much about her,,,and what woman would endanger her marriage and stay overnight with some guy if she WASNT having sex with him,,or trying to??Get over yourself JR. You aint the first and you won't be his last. He didn't cause your problems, you did."
1,not worth the money,Any one who likes or thinks this is a good book isn't an Eminem supporter. The only person who can write a book on themselves is that person. Nobody knows Eminem more than himself and his family that are close to him. How can u say that this book is a factual book when you have to read a book to find out yourself who Eminem really is? Nobody in Eminem's public will know the true him. A book that is written by a woman who tried to get with Eminem when Eminem said no is obviously goin to exaggerate the story a little. There may be some truth in this but we will only be able to find out from those who REALLY know Eminem!!!
1,Lead us not into temptation...,"I just wanted to say that as a fan of Eminem, it's very tempting to purchase this book. However, out of respect for him and his family, I will not. If you want to get to know him better, I would suggest you purchase 'Angry Blonde', which is an official book of Eminem. Although it is not an autobiography, it contains all of his lyrics and it was very interesting to read directly from Eminem himself about how he put together each song, and his reasons for doing each song. There are also extra treats as well as lots of great pictures.I feel that if Eminem wanted his fans to know certain things then he would write a book of his own - which I would buy in a heartbeat. Actually, his CD's are almost like autobiographies in themselves. As Eminem said about his songs in Rolling Stone magazine, ""If you listen to them and don't take the words out of context, they'll tell you why I'm saying this or that...They will tell you everything.""Good enough for me!Peace"
1,This is not the poor mand james bond vol 4,"the title says it all, this book is the survivor vol 4. if you are looking for PMJB vol keep hunting its an elusive volume"
4,Stable little SSB Rcvr in an awkward box,"Unit performed well , especially when hooked up to an outdoor antenna on SW. The Manual was not very helpful. But the ability to tune SSB and CW in 40 Hz steps via a knob make it all worth while. The organization of the ujnit into commercial and International SW bands was not useful to me since I was interested in Ham and Marine SSB bands. Using the Antenna Gain control (Pre-amp?) was very useful in cutting down background noise on SSB. Would have been nice to lable individual Memory Buttons on SW as you can on FM. Also the ability to control selectivity would have been nice. But hey, this is a general purpose, portable SW radio that can be easily packed and set up to keep tuned in from anywhere. I'm having a lot of fun with it."
3,Adequate but not exceptional,"I own a Sony ICF-2010, Grundig YB400 and just purchased the ATS-909. Of the three I would give the ATS-909 the lowest score. It definitely lacks the sensitivity of the other two. (Though connecting an external antenna helps greatly but defeats the purpose of a portable radio.) And I find the audio quality to be muddled and tiring to listen to.If you're looking for a good portable I would also recommend the Grundig YB400 or the new Sony ICF-7600GR."
4,Very Good SW for the Money,I am well pleased with the ATS 909 and will not hesitate to recommend someone else to buy it. It is a very good portable radio and really what makes this radio is the (guess) 20ft uncoiling antenna. It has the normal telescoping antenna but it also has the other antenna (and it has its own jack as well). I have been listening to SW for 20 years or so and it ranks at or near the top for portables.
2,Not up to it technically,"I agree that Richter is a great great artist, but his technique just isn't up to the Grieg. He really struggles at times."
3,The guide is very useful,"I've used the previous edition of this guide and have found it to be very useful in preparing a trip. The guide appears written from the perspective of a small powerboat, thus encouraging quite a few surprizes if taken too literally. It is not clear how ""updated"" the new edition is. I've found I got tired before I could find substantial changes or cruising insights."
3,Just the facts please!,"Good publication. Could benefit from MANY more detailed maps and pictures as well as MUCH more anchorage information. For the true sailing voyager that won't afford a Marina this may NOT be the right guide for you. Well articulated, but ambiguous prose, can prove a bit misleading. I prefer the dry hard facts outlined in easily referenced, numbered sequences."
3,memoirs of a space traveler,"A sequel to The Star Diaries, we visit once again with Ijon Tichy in more amusing (mis?)adventures.Is it as good as the prequel? Unfortunately, no--but it comes mighty close.And where else could you find answers to questions such as: Just who created the universe and why'd they foul it up so miserably? Why haven't they gotten all the bugs out of this time travel business? How come clones are so touchy? What does Doctor Diagoras have in those vats anyway? And, perhaps the Eternal Question we've all asked ouselves at one time or another: How do we know we're all not just brains kept in a box by a mad scientist who's feeding us sensory data of what we believe to be the real world? Hmmm. The words themselves are a sheer pleasure to read.(I'm determined to work ""entelechy"" sometime into a conversation.) There are puns and other word-plays of the kind only Lem does so easily. Even if you've never read a work by Lem, I'm sure you'll enjoy this one."
1,Al Boo Hoo!,"I don't know what Mac Dre is trying to do on this CD, but I feel he's really shortchanging himself, and all his potential, by rapping and talking wierd and funny style. This is about a half a step above Thizzelle Washington (terrible, except for about 3 songs, pretty decent). If your looking for the rapper who rapped on Young Black Brotha, or even Stupid Doo Doo Dumb, and the origional Rompelation, you won't find it here, or Thizzelle Washington. I used to love listening to MD, but his new style gives me the creeps and isn't worth paying to listen to."
3,swashbuckler dvd,The movie is great but the dvd is not for al european players useable. I can only play this dvd on my pc.
3,A DECENT MOVIE,"This movie wasn't a classic but it was a fun pirate movie with some great dialouge that you could never say in a movie today. What with political correctness and all. Robert Shaw gives a fun performance in this movie and James Earl Jones, Beau Bridges, Avery Shriber, and Peter Boyle all give fine performances as well. And the beautiful sexy genevieve Bujold. Oh she's so hot in this movie. (u get 2 c her butt) :) I recommend this movie highly for this price. It's a funner adventure than most of the drivel that's coming out of hollywood lately."
4,"Highly recommended, excellent set of Dr John live","This is a marvelous live recording of Dr. John from the legendary Lone Star from 1986 to kick off series of live performance discs from him. This is just Dr. John and his piano, singing and playing a number songs associated with him and/or New Orleans. Performances including vocals are wonderful and some of the material is not standrad stuff. Included is a bonus DVD with him answering questions and demonstrating aspects of the New Orleans tradition. Only reason not giving this a fifth star is that perhjaps that should be reserved not simply for superb recordings, but ones that stand out as definitive for an idiom or a performer. I am not sure whether this is such a disc."
1,Accept No Imitations,The Dancing Vamps are neatly packaged second rate rubbishWhy listen to this when you can listen to the real thing?
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!,"My son recieved this for his birthday and we ended up taking it back. I never write reviews, but this was such an annoying experience I just had to. There is about 25 different steps you have to do to set up the Slurpee maker, which by that time the ice is melting, you are really fed up, and your kids don't want a slurpee anymore... Then after we did all the annoying steps, the maker wouldn't spin...it just made a sound and didn't do a thing. I packed it up and will NEVER buy one of those again or even look at one. Talk about a piece of useless garbage...just go and buy a 99 cent slurpee and forget about this thing because all you are going to get is a headache and melted ice."
1,This doesn't Work at all!,I tried this slurpee maker several times. It does not work. It gets too cold and freezes so uch that it stops spinning (which is how the slurpee is made). I tried with two different types of brand new batteries and had the same results. This was a total waste of money.
1,DO NOT BUY,"It seemed like a fun idea, since my 9 year old daughter loves slurpees. What a waste of money! There are numerous parts to assemble, and they are difficult to line up so that the gears operate properly. I spent an hour trying to get make the first slurpee before I gave up. (By the way, I followed the directions to the letter). My daughter was so disappointed, since not only did she get very little participation in making the slurpee (too complex), but then she didn't get to enjoy the drink. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!"
1,Save your time and energy!,Don't waste your time. It doesn't work as it says. Very frustrating! The kids were very upset.
2,not worth the money,I bought this for my daughter and we brought it home and tried it out. while purchasing the product we also bought duracell batteries. It wasn't finished making the slushee before the batteries were dead and we had just bought the. It went back that day. not worth the money at all.
1,Awful!,"This product has 19 steps to complete before your 1 tiny slurpee comes out (if it does)- this is after you put the machine together! It isn't difficult, just a time-consumming pain that isn't worth the effort at all. My son always wanted one of these and it was his one gift to open before leaving on a trip for the holidays. After wasting an hour, we ended up with a clogged machine (instructions say to add a 12 oz. soda but warn that this will happen with a soda with two high a sugar content- won't work at all with diet). We tried the concoction that was still in the machine- it was completely flat from processing. You would really have to experiment to find a drink that would work- not worth the effort at all!"
3,Slurpee's don't taste that good.,Good company. Super fast shipping. The quality of this product is okay but the slurpee's have a strange taste.
3,Good Enough,"Sturdy, works well. Folds a little bigger than expected. The kicker: this product needs a longer nose in front of the wheel. There is no leverage to dump the contents out!"
2,This cheap radio simply works,"This cheap radio simply works.It can only receive strong signal of international stations. It has poor nearby station rejection.This radio has very poor sensitivity in all bands. For example, I live in San Francisco and I was unable to receive KLIV1590 a San Jose station. The nearby strong station 1550 just overwhelms the signal. Shortwave major bands 19m, 25m, 31m, 49m all have poor reception.I will NOT recommend this radio for everyone who like to listen to shortwave program. But I will consider that this is an earthquake prevention radio since it has very light weight and can receive local stations."
2,Irritating,"The book does give a nice atmosphere of occupied Paris. What is irritating is that the author uses literal translations of french. Examples: 'My Old One', rather than 'Old Man', then in other places he uses the french word unnecessarily, ex. 'Imbecile' (spelled with accent mark). The characters are cliche, think second rate mystery films of the 30's and 40's. As the plot thickens, it becomes ridiculous and unbelievable. Not worth the trouble."
5,Great Book,Awesome book. Was assigned it in a college course and I think the professor did a good job picking out the book.
5,It is simply wonderful,"This cd, from the German label Mole Listening Pearls is more than wonderfull ... Together with their other release ""Death by Chocolate"" one of the best Lounge, D&B;, Jazzy, Trip-Hop albums around ... nice as well they include on most songs lyrics ...Very, very nice ... Some Cheese, some Wine, a loved one on your side ... dining, or making love, this music will make you naturally high ... truly magnifique! This album will not only relax you, but will charge your batteries on the same time, making you want to conquer on love and life ... it done it for me! In addition to this album, try Music aand Wine by Blue 6 (Naked Music release). Hope to hear more from them."
5,Great book for women of all ages,"Cheryl Dickow brings a fresh new insight on women in the Bible. She is especially good at bringing a perspective that reveals how women of the Bible faced the same issues we face today. It is a great book for personal study or to study with a group of friends.Having had the privilege of hearing Cheryl speak to a group of women, this book reflects her heart and is written like a warm conversation with a friend. I highly recommend this book."
4,"Very good, but...",Very versatile to use because of its many features. Easy to use in basic point and shoot mode. Difficult to aim accurately outdoors in bright light because display is washed-out by background light.
4,Excellent compact digital camera,"This camera is great, it's small enough to fit in a pocket without being bulky and the zoom is exceptional for something so small! The battery has incredible life so far. I'm still getting some blurry pictures but I haven't had the camera all that long so I'm still getting used to it."
3,"Good, easy to use camera with a big problem","The biggest problem is that the LCD screen is unreadable @ outdoors in daylight, so framing pictures under these conditions depends on good luck.Not having eye view as a option is very frustrating. The selection of night pictures scene is always blurry, may I need a tripod for that. However the selection of pictures with available light is very good.Battery life is good, I used it all day long in different set ups and the battery holds very well, do not forget to recharge it at the end of the day and will be ready for the next day. Xd cards are not available everywhere, and is more expensive than sd cards.I will buy it again if comes with a eye view option..."
1,a huge disappointment,"This camera is virtually useless. Not having a view finder is a real detriment. I tried taking pictures while skiing and in the sun, the LCD screen is invisible. You cannot see what you are taking. I tried other shots outside with the same result. I guess it's fine for taking inside shots, but I need a camera that does both. So I bought a new camera that works."
4,my new green camara,"I am really happy with the camara, but i still have o too much experience with it....i like it a lot!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Net Admins - Time to change your hat to that of a hacker....,"This book is a good insight for those that need to gain an understanding of principles and methods at an easy to medium level. The hardened reader will have covered these topics in many other books. However, the perspective is now that of a hacker and not of the Net Admin. Lots of info covering the various approaches used by hackers, some of which my team were oblivious to! The Tiger Suite toolset is very useful in helping to show just how a network can be probed / penetrated via simple techniques.The content is very easy to read and the information is collated in a logical manner. Worthwhile adding to a collection of other networking and security books, although not definitive."
5,good choice,"if you're in the market for a good security book, look no further. the methods illustrated in this book are easy to understand even for beginners, and technical enough for the advanced user. i was very pleased with the tools and source code as i too like to see how the programs work."
4,Must Buy for Security Analyst newbies,"Very well written technical book concerning Internet security and the inherent vunerablities of operating systems and the very structure of the Internet itself. Brings to light the tools and methodologies ""hackers"" use to locate, scan, probe, penetrate, and clear tracks on systems attached to the Internet and or to corporate LAN's. I use the term newbies, however, relatively speaking. To make the very most of this book and I HOPE this book's target audience being(security analysts/security enthusiasts), one should have a background in the C programming language, operating systems including but not limited to Windows and UNIX and detailed knowledge of the OSI stack coupled with intermediary network devices. To catch a thief one must think as a thief..., don't let this book slip through your fingers."
5,not surprised,"with all the controversy i see here i had to see the book for myself. i wasnt going to buy it but after looking at it in b&n i did. i don't know about it being a complete reference but its very stinkin close to it. i found info on everything hacking, proggies, code, scripts, technology guides. i'm not surprised its a 5star book!! im going to buy the next one when im finished."
5,Awesome,As a security reference this book is awesome. I found exactly what I was looking for in a matter of minutes. Thnx.
4,Great overview of Vulnerability tools and how to use them,"In Hack Attacks Revealed, John Charillo covers alot of the types of tools hackers use to compromise a system. This book comes with a CD with examples of some of the tools he talks about. This is a good book for the experienced Security Professional and the beginner. He explains what to expect from certain tools and how to use them, but does not really talk about scripts, and specific buffer overuns and specific code. This is a great overview and should be a must have to compliment Hacking Exposed."
4,Rave it!,I totally dig this mag....read it daily and have a new idea each time I am finished...I am an aspiring designer!!
3,Affif need others to interplay with,"This is a rather bland solo guitar set. Joe pass's ""Virtuoso"" is far suoperior. I really belive that Ron Affif needs others to interact with. His 52nd street themes is a masterpiece. It is one of my personal favorite jazz guitar record ever! Saying that solitude was of a disapointment. Keep on looking."
3,Check your zipper size first,"I assumed, wrongly, that this would fit standard Mountain Hardwear tent zippers. I think the instructions specifically mention tents, but check your tent's zipper size before buying this. I've never seen a backpacking tent with zippers this large, and the parts in this kit are very much too large for my Mountain Hardwear tent.I'm sure there will be a reason to use this in the future, and it looks like a good system, but it will stay in my gear for now. I'll probably sent the tent to MHW for repair."
1,Inconsistent,"I purchased two of these toners for my All-In-One MF5750. Great price. However, on one of them the print is a little on the light side and attempts to improve the print quality through printer settings have not been successful. No smudges or dots, so OK in that regard.On the second one, however, every page comes out crooked, making the cartridge pretty much useless.On one of the cartridges, the Low Toner signal always blinks, and although it will print anything I send it from my computer, for some unknown reason it will not print incoming faxes. I think I'll just stick with the more expensive Canon cartridges in the future."
1,A lot less page yield,I finished using one cartridge a couple weeks after I bought the product. It yielded a lot less than 2500 pages like it claims.
4,Good recycled cartridge,"Cartridge was delivered promptly! Initial print quality produced a grayish background. However, this faded after 20-30 pages, and print quality is now quite good. Very pleased overall!"
1,Don't buy these,"I ordered 2 of these from Dunkin Inks through Amazon. They were both defective and lasted only a month of light use. The plastic pins that hold the toner together broke and the unit was no longer usable. I am back to using an old ""refurbished"" toner cartridge from another company. I have used a lot of ""refurbished"" toners over the past 5 years and these are the first ones I have ever had a problem with. Had only one broke, I would consider it a coincidence, but since they both broke in the same way, I would say they are low quality toners to begin with."
2,So good so far,"Update: I upgraded my computer to Canon Imageclass MF3240 from MF 3110. They both use the X25 cartridge. This worked on my old computer but not in the newer one.I had no issues with connectivity as I read in other reviews. My last Canon cartridge lasted me for a year, at least, because I don't print on a regular basis. So I may update this review at some point, but for 1/4 of the price for a Canon cartridge, I say it's worth the try, esp since shipping is free..."
1,exactly what I was trying not to buy,I wanted a fitted disposable face rest cover and somehow missed that this was the nurse cap style. I love the fitted disposables so I tried to use these and it's just not anywhere near as convenient and doesn't provide the same level of coverage for the interior of the crescent - exactly where you'd want coverage.
5,Wonderful collection of poetry!,Each poem is a looking glass through which Dr. Meek tries to convey the beauty of Batswana and the dimensions of human experience. Her use of language is as stunning as it is beautiful. Very impressive collection! Highly recommend!
4,Write part for the wrong car,"I wanted to use this on my 2001 Chevy Silverado because Amazon told me it fit my car. Well it did fit but the connector fit in backwards and was giving low voltage readings. It turned out a separate part, Bosch 13193 had the correct connector. Oddly Amazon and other sites list the 13193 as not fitting my vehicle. Moral of the story is to go under your vehicle, take a look at the wiring connector and check the notching to see if it matches up with this part."
1,This is NOT a CD,"Warning . . . this is NOT, as they imply, a CD [""Media: CD""]. . . this is CD-ROM software. Do not order if you want a CD."
4,Good value,"Well-made. Steel with matte chrome finish. Platform is 9-7/8 x 3-3/4"" Height adjustable from 4-1/4 to 9-1/8 "" at center. Platform angle varies from about 5 degrees at lowest setting to 15 at highest. Folded flat, it measures 12-3/4 x 5-3/4 x 11/16"" A little wobbly on carpet or at highest setting. Made in Germany."
4,Very Helpful,"We've used this book numerous times during garden season to help sort out the good bugs from the bad bugs. Although we take care of our books, this one has started coming apart. We noticed the master gardeners from the local university also use this book.It would be nice if it had different indexes to help sort insects by size/color/winged etc, so we could determine what some of the unknown bugs are."
4,"Good bugs, Bad bugs","This book was on the suggested reading list for a Master Gardener class. I have found it to be very interesting and helpful in helping me to identify the ""bad"" bugs that invade and destroy my gardens and the ""good bugs"" that will help protect my garden. I am looking forward to warm, sunny weather and a chance to go play in the dirt!"
1,False Advertising,"This DVD was horrible, I purchased the DVD because I own a Gazelle. The title suggested it was a Gazelle workout, however, it consisted of Tony Little acting spastic at the beginning, and then progressing to crunches and various exercises. NOT A SINGLE WORKOUT ON THE GAZELLE. A horrible DVD."
4,donna kills it on this one,"For all of you that thought cap was done after he put out the yin and yang album(which was pretty much garbage) he proves all of you wrong. The struggle is bangin from start to finish even the bonus tracks are nice. Most of the cd is produced by cap and remedy. They both have close ties to the wu-tang clan, but there is no rza production. Inspecta Deck and Reakwon are featured on the album which makes for a nice addition to the record. If you liked cappadonna on the pillage or his work with the wu you will fully enjoy this album"
4,the realist,this album was slept on cappa came hard with the lyrics with this album if u like cappadonna get this cd
4,"Convenient, chocolatey, good in 3X chocolate ice cream",Arrived quickly. I didn't want to distill my own so this was the next best thing. Used in triple chocolate ice cream so I haven't used it as a stand-alone flavor yet. Price was reasonable. I am happy with it and I do not have a history of product happiness. The ice cream was good- really good. Give this a try.
4,Great buy!!,"I received this diaper bag as a gift and am soooo happy coz it can hold a lot of stuff in it. It has multiple compartments, one bottle holder, changing pad, a bag for holding messy stuff and looks cute too :)"
2,Doesn't rate the Bosch name!,For a blade made in China it is probably pretty good. Doesn't measure up to other Bosch tools that I own.
2,stalker,"I have a love hate relationship with Kellerman's novels...my main problem is the many inaccuracies with which she litters her books...it is jarring. In this one, she has Rina, supposedly a supurb cook, putting in the broccali before her husband showers. Nobody does that. If it is in the details that greatness lies,she misses."
2,Not as full bodied as most of Kellerman's mysteries,"Stalker by Faye Kellerman has a faster pace than her usual. The suspense keeps you glued to the page when you should be doing something else, like sleeping. Cindy Decker is determine to blend in with the cops she works with, but not all the boys are receptive to letting the girls play in their games. It may sound childish, but there is a lot of it still out there and for a female cop it can be deadly. Cindy can be forgiven her stubborness, but she makes some realy dumb moves for a woman who should know better, I expected more from her. As always in Kellerman's stories, family is a big part of it all. In this brave new world where women are allowed to have as much courage as men, if you add in a few insecure egos and one woman's determination to do it all on her own you have all the makings for a great tale."
2,"Okay, not as good as others, and disappointing writing","As a great fan of Faye Kellerman's series, I have read them all in order, and some twice. This is not one I would read again. I am pleased in some ways that Kellerman is bringing in Cynthia as a more central character, but I miss seeing Decker and Rina. What bothered me most was the poor quality of the writing and/or editing; in one place, Kellerman writes (something like), ""She parked herself in front of the TV and turned on the boob tube."" Overwritten (no need for repeating any word for TV) and ""boob tube"" is just stupid (I don't think many 25 year olds use it). These type of ""Gen X"" pepper the book and are annoying. Again, it is repetitive and it seems that, because she has been a bestselling author for many years, either Kellerman or her editors are slacking off. Don't, please!"
1,Very Disappointing...,"After a terrific series about likable characters, Peter & Rina Decker, why would Faye Kellerman want to create such an unlikeable character in Cindy? I could never get into the story because I never cared about what happened to her. She's arrogant and, despite the ""Ivy League education"", stupid! Stick with Peter and Rina from now on!"
2,"Watch good, band not.","Watch is nice. Clasp was nonfunctional and could not be made to work properly. Fortunately had a similar watch band to replace the bracelet. A for the watch, F for the band."
3,Clasp seems difficult to snap quickly. What's up with that? My wife has and older example of this same model. That clasp works,"as it should, but the crystal/lens scatched up all too easily. May need to swap out clasps. To much hassel for a Seiko."
1,Unreliable Product,"This beautiful watch was purchased for my wife in July of 2011 and is being returned to the Seiko service center for the third time because it, occasionally, simply stops keeping time or the day/date feature doesn't work. Seiko service personnel have been quick to repair and return the timepiece, but the fixes haven't worked, thus far. We're expecting a replacement, not a repair, or a total refund. [Update]: Three weeks have passed since we received this watch back from Seiko. Same timepiece--- hopefully fixed. As of this date (12/31/11), the wristwatch is keeping accurate time and date. Our fingers are crossed..."
2,Bad Seiko Watch,Purchased this watch 12/7/2009 and gave it to my wife for Christmas present and on 2/1/2010 it died..........I took the watch to a mall and had a new battery installed just in case but it still will not work so I'll send it back to Seiko and hopefully it will be repaired..........this was an exact replacement of a watch I gave my wife 25 years ago that worked like a charm up until a couple of months before Christmas so I'm hoping I purchased a legitmate Seiko and not a cheap knockoff!!! I'm sending back to Seiko and will update this if it's repaired timely with no problems!They repaired the watch no problems and it's still working great.........as of 11/11/11
4,A Good Game Overall,"I have to say, I think that this was a good game, but the one flaw was that after the game storyline finished, it was boring to play.Nevertheless, I liked the game, although probably only American third-graders will know all the answers. I played this game when I was seven or eight and I hadn't learnt much history or geography, or science. I still think the game is good.I find many people disappointed in the game because of Polly, the antagonist. I actually didn't care about what she said, and neither should any other player. In fact, I'm considered not very tolerant, and yet if Polly said anything, I'd just think my own retort back to her.This is a good product to buy, and I don't think you'll regret buying it, if you're a bored teenager that wants something or a kid that does this as extra-credit work, and although Polly might try to kill your confidence, the good characters will help build it up again."
4,"Great art work, fun stuff","I love my Sheltie, so this shirt had lots of appeal to me (I wish they had a tri-color version, to match my dog, but oh well.) The shirt is decent quality, and several people have commented about the saying printed on it -- a little hard to read, but pretty clever/cute.The line of shirts features many different breeds of dog (not just Shelties) so if you're into man's best friend, check it out, I'm sure you'll find one you like."
1,The Real World You Won't Miss Seeing,"Unfortunately, this video has nothing worth seeing. It is poorly hosted by two of the shows' most unlikeable cast members; it is disjointed and without narrative or structure. There is little insight into the cast members' true feelings about the show and fellow cast members; much of the video focuses on the crew, which no one cares about. Any juicy or interesting sections are blurred out. This video will be a BIG, BIG, disappointment for any fan of The Real World hoping for insight or inside information on the show."
1,Crushed on Arrival,95% of pops received were crushed upon delivery; all others were cracked. A huge disappointment.
5,These Recipes Really Work,"&#65279;I used to have to prepare several different dishes for each meal because my children usually don't like the same foods. However, with Favorite Family Meals, my children and I decide together which meal I will prepare and now we can all eat the same delicious and healthy meal together. So far, my favorite recipe is the Salmon Teriyaki. My kids, of course, love the desserts, particularly, the Teddy Bear Cupcakes."
1,Do Not But - too many typos in measurements,"I bought this book because it had great pictures and I thought it would be fun to cook this way for my daughther... But aready the first item I decided on was a disaster.The animal shaped cheese buns... it called for 1.5 cups of flour and 3 cups of water - and she is talking about preparing a smooths dough... well it was more runny... and after fixing the mistake we had about 8 or 9 cups of flour and not only 6 little buns,...I tried another one and same issues in the measurements! Be very carful and don't buy it!"
2,Fails after 2.5 years.,"Much like the reviewer of the PDUMH20ATNET, my unit failed after about 2.5 years as well. Both primary and secondary inputs failed without warning. Also, the manual states that the primary input should not be connected to ""line interactive"" UPS sources; many APC UPS's have line interactive outputs. Nice features and low price, but seems like the service life is a short 2.5 yrs. Definitely not for mission critical applications."
1,Not what was expected.,"I thought that a video of this type would have the swearing and nudity included, hence what you couldn't see on MTV. It was just like watching the regular show. A big disappointment."
2,Very Disappointed,"I watch every show and when I saw your advertisement for this video I could not wait to get my hands on it. I thought I would finally see a uncut version. Your commercial state NAKID, UNCUT & UNCENSORED. IT was very censored. I feel ripped off."
4,Mixed Bag,"I am not big on short stories, but having read and loved Heart Shaped Box last year, I thought I would give Joe Hill's anthology try. I'm very glad I did. These stories are an eclectic collection, some of them not horror at all, but perfectly pitched stories about fathers and sons. Some were outright creepy, like the boy who turns into a cricket and some were a bit of both, sweet and slightly creepy, which was the story of a young teen ghost who haunts a movie theatre.Although not every story clicked with me I really enjoyed the writing and the variety Hill provided here; I hope he is working on another novel as we speak, I will be first on line to buy it."
4,20th Century Ghosts - Amazon,"Haven't completed the book yet, but enjoying the stories so far. Some are definitely off the wall...blown up doll living as a human and all!! Great read on my Kindle!! Thanks, Amazon!"
2,20th century ghosts,some of these short stories have very bad endings. too bad joe didn't talk to dad (stephen king) before publishing.
5,Cotton Patch Gospel,I am very pleased with the product (a CD) and the rapid service sending it to my home. The CD was in perfect order.
5,Cotton Patch Gospel,A very interesting accounting of the Gospel. Easy to understand and enjoyable for all ages. I used part of the video as a program for a women's group and they enjoyed it so much. We'll view the remainder at a later time.
1,Boring Book,It's just not a very interesting story. The characters are not vivid and it all just seems so stilted. But read the synopsis and the reviews and make up your own mind. Vendetta or critical analysis? Read them all decide for yourselves
3,Good for the price,"Decent blade, but certainly not in the same league as the 96 tooth freud blade I've had for 15 years. This blade deflects when trying to fine trim red oak, just not rigid enough. As always, dealing with Amazon was a pleasure!"
3,Nice book for dog lovers,"Very nice book! Good selection of breeds, includes the popularest ones, but there were some surprises too.I was little disappointed about some pictures but the book was still worth of buying."
3,OK,My 3 year old did enjoy reading this. He has shown little interest in it compared to the regular I Spy books. This book seemed to easy for him. He likes the challenge of finding things!!
1,Good for beginners only,"I thought that this video would show me some new moves, but I ended up not learning a thing. It's only good for beginners I think."
3,Basics,"The DVD is good for an introduction to swing dance, but you could get a lot more out of going to classes. After I purchased this item I attended BYU's Swing Kids club, and realized that the dancers on the DVD are not nearly as talented or fun to watch as the people in that club. Still, if you don't have access to a swing club this will give you a start on the style and steps of swing dancing."
3,Great Swingin' Starter / History Tape Set,"Lots of content for the price. Pablo Rocks! When you get this, use the stop motion on the B & W Lindy Hop vintage footage of the dancers. WOW!! They attept to defy all the laws of physics. Instructional video is rather dry, but I have given it other who had no clue -- and now they do. Footage of local digs in Minneapolis."
1,not that great,"i thought that this tape was not that great because of the poor quality of the video itself and the people involved were very unprofessional. although this tape has some good moves, that is why i would give it one star."
4,Great product at a great price!,"Bought this for my son for Christmas - we love it. The only thing that would have been helpful would be instructions - the importance of matching up the correct midi ports, etc. Otherwise, works very well and I'm very happy with it."
3,Could be better,"For a beginner, this book is ok. I would recommend getting a used copy. If something you really want to keep, then invest in a new one. I personally felt that the descriptions did not give enough detail. Some things it describes I don't know why someone would dream of anyway. I never dreamt about Carbolic Acid, have you? If you have, maybe you should get this book. :-)"
3,Not very good,"I was not very impressed with the performance of these ear buds. I had some that i got with mySanDisk Sansa Clip 1 GB MP3 Player (Black)but the padding got torn, so I figured I would get these. Turns out these pump out a lot less volume than my others. Thankfully they had spare padding so I just used the spare padding that came with these."
3,"Story inspiring, writing disappointing",I'd been told by a friend that she thought the book was fantastic but it didn't live up to my expectations. The author just wasn't that good at telling a very inspiring story.
3,This review after first viewing...,"My daughter is almost 2, and we just watched this tape for the first time. While it held her interest quite a bit, I don't think that she realized that the device in the cartoon was a potty. It certainly didn't look like any potty I have seen. This was mentioned in other reviews as well, but I think if it is viewed enough, the point will get across. Much has also been mentioned in other reviews about the ""expert"" in the Parents' Guide at the end of the video. He gave good information, but obviously isn't comfortable being on camera. It is his delivery and seeming uneasiness that others have mentioned as being possibly frightening to children. The doctor's accent and cadence reminded me a lot of Christopher Walken, and he could definitely give tots good reason for alarm. (There was no mention of a wristwatch being found in the potty, by the way.)"
2,Not so great....,"My daughter is watching the DVD right now, she's interested but I don't think it will teach her anything. The potty looks nothing like any of the potty's out there in stores. The DVD quality is lousy, keeps flickering. The cartoon is brief and the little girl does it all in one sitting! ya, right.I think she only likes the video because of the babies.Cute song, they should really update this video. I agree with the other parents about how they should have shown a baby pulling down their pants to use the potty, kids aren't usually running around the house butt naked all day! And the close up of the bum hole is pretty un-necessary too!"
5,So good that I am buying it again!,"This is an excellent video for kids. It allows you to start potty training education early by holding the attention of younger toddlers, as well as being entertaining to older children. My son loved it, and now I am buying it again for my daughter. A must have. It starts with a cartoon child getting the potty as a present. Then it shows that the child trys to use it many ways, until they learn through a series of accidents and successes how to use the potty.They make sure to stress that accidents will happen, and this is ok. Then the video changes to a catchy tune showing real children dancing to the music and sitting on their potties. It is amazing how quickly they start singing with the video while sitting on their own potty for more than 5 minutes!"
3,"Not bad, but not terrific either.","This DVD is short, like less than 20 minutese, most of which is the catchy song. The actual animation is short, but it's content is good, like discussing where pee and poop come out. This is not the kind of DVD to get if you hope it will train your kid merely by watching it. It's cute, and my toddler likes it, but it's priced too high for how short it is. Hence the 3 stars."
3,I'm not sure what I think about this video,"I expected a lot more from this video from reading the reviews however this video did not meet my expectations. I wanted the characters to actually go through the motions of potting training, by pulling their pants down and getting on the potty. There was not enough sitting on the potty by the other babies, however Prudence does a good job by sitting and showing how to use the potty,I wish they showed how to pull her pants down and then sit to pee pee in the potty. My 24 month old son was doing a good job using the potty before I purchased the video. I needed assistance with showing him how to pull his pants down and tell me when he has to use the potty. He use the potty when he's around the house naked, as soon as I put underwear on him he pee's in his pants. The video captured his attention as I sat with him to encourage him want was happening in the video. I have not seen any difference however I guess time will tell."
5,The Unadulterated Cat,I love Terry Pratchett but this was the best. I have waited years to get a copy of this book and found myself reading it out load to anyone that would listen including the dog.
1,Impenetrable,"Was given this as a gift by a friend who is a cat enthusiast. Not quite sure what possessed her. I think cats are cute, but I'm far from having the enthusiasm required to appreciate this book, which is a lengthy exegesis on the behaviors of ""adulterated"" cats and ""real"" cats, a metaphysical speculation which proves tiresome after the jacket flap. I can scarcely fathom how one could devote a single page, let alone an entire book, to an imaginary (and slightly deranged) argument in which artificial categories are imposed on animals incapable of resisting them. Yet Terry Pratchett has achieved this, presumably in the expectation of laughter from the similarly pet-obsessed, who, if they cannot write a book like this, will certainly pay to read it. But the result is less than adorable, far from funny, and not a little sickly."
2,Not as funny as the reviews would have you believe,"This was my introduction to Terry Pratchett's writing. Reading all of the reviews led me to believe that this book was a funny take on the world of cats. This book, which reads like an essay of observations, is not ground breaking and is certainly not hilarious. If I were counting I would say that there might have been ten chuckles all together. Certainly not as funny as it was cracked up to be.The treatment felt superficial and the observations felt recycled from other writings about cats. Nothing here would recommend this book over any other cat book or story that I have read."
1,The language style of this book is not for young readers,"Our family adores the Dinotopia books, both from the original author and the offshoots. However, we found this book an extremely difficult read for our nine year old, who is a fantastic reader. Some sample phrases we struggled with: an inherent psychological disinclination; hygienic accoutrements; unable to eschew an innate clumsiness; elegiac stream. This book needs a disclaimer that it isn't appropriate for young readers. In struggling with the language, we kept losing the thread of the wonderful story."
3,another kid's review,"Hatchet vs. Cry In the WildWe are 6th graders and we just got done reading Hatchet, and watching Cry In the Wild. I would give the movie 3 out of 5. But I would not recommend buying the movie, I would recommend renting it first, because the movie is good but is not great. So don't buy the movie if you don't like the book because the movie is worse than the book."
1,another kids reveiw,"Hi I'm here to tell you about the movie called ""Cry in the Wild"". The movie graphics are really bad, and I advise you not to watch this movie. The movie did not follow the book at all. The movie left out lots of important details, like the tornado it just showed strong winds. I recommend the book because the movie is really off.P.S. warning this movie may cause drowsiness, boredom, slur of speech, if you get these symptoms read the book."
1,Another Kid's Review,"I watched the movie ""Cry in the Wild"" and did not like it at all! It had NO good detail and was un-real. Like when the bear got stabbed -I mean get real blood does not squirt out like that! It was kind of weird when Brian talked to the berry !? But I give it a little credit for the pretty scenery but other than that it kind of stunk!!!!!!!!"
1,It doesn't really deserve any stars.,"Okay, I'm in the sixth grade, and we just read this book in class, and then watched the movie. I can't freaking believe that Gary Paulsen consented this, much less wrote the screenplay. It's a horrible movie, and does no justice to the book. I liked the book. For some reason it reminded me of Lord of the Flies, except it was less depressing, cuz there weren't a bunch of kids running around killing eachother. Brian had some character, and there was an intellectual side to the book, but the movie..urgh. It was a mockery."
1,Another kids review,"I am a sixth grader, our class just read the book Hatchet, and watched the movie ""Cry In the Wild. I recommend the book over the movie. The book had better details then the movie. Instead of a moose attack in the book, the movie had a bear attack. I liked the book much better. I give the movie a 1/2 star out of 5."
1,NOT WORTHY!,"I'll cut right to the chase. I hated this movie. We had read the book Hatchet (by Gary Paulsen) in class, and this was the movie of it. The name was changed for box office purposes. This movie is not worthy of the plot of Hatchet. The movie people messed up the plot, and Brain had no character. The story was nothing without Paulsen's touch. If you've read the book, spare yourself the agony. If you haven't read the book, don't bother with the movie."
3,Great classroom movie,I use this movie every year with our middle school students to show how important it is to stay in groups and pay attention to your surroundings. This happened in a small town and can happen again. It is important for young people to see how much work effort and sadness takes place when a loved one is missing and may deter them from pulling pranks like not comming home or not telling people where they are. Nicely produced realistic but not over dramatic.
3,Potty for Him,"I didn't like the DVD, the book is much better and I thought it was expensive for what was offered. My son who is 3 years old, didn't really like the DVD either."
2,"Too short and out dated, not for children WORKING on potty training","The cost of this DVD is ridiculous considering the movie is less then 20 minutes. There is a ""parenting section"" of the DVD in which Dr. Franel addresses some basic potty training tips that were only useful if you (as a parent) hadn't researched ANYTHING about potty training prior to viewing this DVD. I always take heed to amazon customer reviews but I believe in this instance it let me down. If you are planning on using this DVD to INTRODUCE potty training to your child then this process might work for you, but if your like me and just want to get you child excited about potty training and they've been working on for a while then PASS it up."
1,Not For Using the Toilet,"This video focuses on using a small, plastic ""potty chair"" and doesn't make any connection to using the toilet. My 20-month old son got very excited when he saw in the video and went into the other room to get his Bumbo seat (NOT a potty chair), brought it back, sat in it, and said, ""Potty!"" Luckily I convinced him not to use the Bumbo that way. But the movie never shows anything about using a toilet and made my son think he should go get a little seat for going to the bathroom. I would rather train my child to use a toilet (which he does, if not perfectly yet) than to carry around a plastic seat and make messes in it.The actual movie is also very short. The ""credits"" (pictures and names of the children who appear) take at least as long as the movie, and they're not that long, either. The movie is a very simple cartoon with sporadic scenes of naked or only diapered toddlers running around with plastic potty chairs. We didn't watch it a second time."
4,Cute video better than other videos,"Nice video, cute, my son will atleast watch it with interest from start to finish. So far this is the better one on the market."
1,Seriously?,"Total amateurish punk pop, done a thousand times better by a thousand different bands since 1976... This is much like what you've heard those annoying neighbor girls playing in their garage. Nothing stands out - neither playing, nor songwriting. Go listen to Legal Weapon, Super Heroines, Holly Vincent, Echobelly, Elastica, Yeah Yeah Yeahs..."
4,great steak cut with great steak knife,"Used them last night to slice through a 1"" New York Strip from Hirchs Meat Market in Plano, Tx. Best Steak cut with the best knife."
2,"Initially great, but don't hold an edge","Initially, I would have highly recommended these steak knives. They were VERY sharp. After only about six months of use, however, they became very dull. My previous set of steak knives stayed sharp for many years.For this reason, I cannot recommend this product."
5,Works just like it's supposed to,"I am still new to digital cameras, so I am learning how to operate a camera that doesn't have a fixed focus lens. I needed an adaptor ring for my Minolta Dimage 7hi to go with this lens, which the seller supplied. This lens mounts on my camera effortlessly, and works in concert with the zoom. Follow the link to pictures I took on my visit to the Altoona Railroad Museum:http://www.lasvegasmikey.com/altoona/index.html"
1,Terrible!,"It's not very often that I actually can't get through a book, but this one I just had to put down. I can't speak much to the quality of the whole story since I didn't finish, but the the writing style is so bad, I couldn't take anymore. If you read the first few chapters, you will see what I mean. He starts of the book by describing the novel's heroine in physical detail, because (of course) she just happens to be a nude model for art classes in her spare time. Which is completely unrelated to the rest of the story. It comes off like a dirty, but also totally cheesy, porn romance novel. I mean, he seriously spends several sentences talking about the color of her nipples, and even compares them to seashells. The whole book goes on like this. I read about 100 pages and then had to stop."
1,Author is too preoccupied with sex,"Instead of reading a thrilling and suspenseful story, I instead had to read numerous, graphic references to the main character's body. I lost count of how many times the author described her breasts. It was silly, distracting, and a waste of time.I'm not usually so harsh when reviewing a book, but really, there was no point to this book. The plot dragged, it was simply not suspenseful, and the author came off sounding like an over sexed teenaged boy."
3,Good for babies!,"My daughter received this toy as a gift when she was 4 months old. She loved it before she could sit up, but after she was sitting up it was hard for her to see the fish even when it was moved to reclining position. Now she is almost a year old and she always grabs the fish wheel and it makes an awful noise. It has held up to torture from her. I also have to agree with the other comments that the mat doesn't stay on and it does take up a lot of room. It is a good buy for babies, but older children (8+ months) I don't think that it is very good."
3,Not bad,This Item is perfect for when your baby is just lying there or when they can fully sit up by themselves. It is not so great when they can roll over. Our little one tends to get twisted and stuck and rolls off of it and isn't very comfortable right now but will be back to loving it once she can fully sit up. :)
2,Uninteresting toy,"My daughter never really did much with this toy. The ""wheel"" of the boat just turns (nothing for the child to do) and the toys that attach are boring. My daughter preferred to play with those toys on their own. This toy just really misses the mark."
1,"You are kidding, right?",I havnt purchased this toy yet but I gotta point out that the manufacturers age and suggested age of up to 24 months contradicts the safety warning a few paragraphs below saying its not suitable for children under 3 years old !
2,really cute but doesn't last,My baby really loved this but after about one week the wheel started making a terrible clicking noise that grew worse as time went on. In less than two weeks it wasn't working.
4,Kept my baby entertained!,"This is a great toy! We first introduced it to our daughter when she was approximately 3 months old and she loved it! She would lay on her back and giggle and coo at the dangling fish and loved the lights and music. Now that she's 5 months old, she still plays with this toy, but she lays on her belly instead of her back. This was money very well spent!"
1,Ocean Wonders Rockin' Aquarium,"I should have taken more time to read the reviews for the Ocean Wonders Rockin Aquarium Gym, had I done this, I would not have registered for this item. This is my first child, so I am just learning. The first time we put our son down on it, he was about 2 weeks old. He was able to spin the ball on the rattle, so my husband and I were happy with the gift until we turned the music wheel on. After about 10 seconds, the fish in the wheel gets stuck and it makes loud clicking noises that never stops unless you hit it. Addition to that, there isn't any padding and the hanging toys fall down. I wanted to return this item but my husband threw the box away. But, after reading the reviews, several consumers have returned it. I plan on doing the same, otherwise I will throw it in the trash. Fisher Price should have tested this item more before putting it on the market. I think this item will be recalled soon, if it hasn't already."
5,Handles rough play pretty well,"I received this as a hand-me-down from a cousin and it was missing the toys/rattles but it worked great just the same. At first my baby didn't really enjoy it when he was about 2 - 3 months old. By the time my LO was 6 months old, I dragged this out of storage again and this time, he loves it! I did end up buying the attachments brand new from an Ebay seller and that just added to my LO's fun. He loves to be rough on the rotating disk that houses the 'aquarium' and he likes to stand in front of it instead of sit down.We enjoy the calypso music a lot - a break from all the usual baby tunes of all his other toys. It is built pretty sturdily and I am glad I got this - even as a hand-me-down. It's one of my son's favorite toys and he loves to scream and shake the bar that houses the music and aquarium thing pretty roughly and it's withstood the rough handling so far."
1,Fleece Jacket,Was supposed to be a womens x-large but is a MANS. Way to big. To much trouble to send back.
5,Stunning,This ginger jar's design and quality is way more than expected.It will be used to house the ashes of a deceased.It is stunning.
3,The message was good...,"The message in this film was sound, but it wasn't enough to make up for the fact that the entire documentary should have been condensed to roughly half its current length. I watched this with a friend, and after the first 15 minutes or so, we found ourselves saying, ""They JUST said this!"" to every other clip. In a few cases, I think they played the same commentary over, verbatim.There are a lot of big names in the film, and I agree with the overall message that most of us should be eating far more vegetables. However, this film didn't really add anything new to the overall dialogue, and it seemed like they were really pushing the whole ""juicing"" lifestyle. I'm all for more vegetables, and juicing is one good way to get more, but it really takes the joy out of eating. I would have liked to see a slightly more moderate approach."
5,Very interesting and informational!,I like the way everything was explained. Makes a lot of sense. I really want my family and friends to see this. It really is an eye opener. Great info.! Well done.
2,wrong item,"The one shown on this webpage is really nice and elegant. The one I received is really ugly looking, golden/black colored, lowest quality seiko I've ever seen. And there is no receipt in the box. The watch box itself is also really really low quality. Everything looks very fake.But the seller did issue the refund, and according to them, it's a ""inventory error"". What I feel sick is, I think they purposely tagged the ugly watch with the ""SXGJ76"" tag. They thought I don't remember how it looks?...I'm OK with defected, damaged item, but this, no. Hope it will never happen again. Was really the worst experience I've ever had on amazon.One lesson from this, is I'll never buy something from non-amazon seller, though I know it's unfair to other good nice non-amazon sellers. Just don't want to mess up with this kind of **** again."
5,Sweet,"If you like some hardcore bass without a subwoofer you should get this cd. The only thing i dont like is the robot voices you hear ever once in a while, but you can turn down the treble and turn up the bass. Your ears will start to hurt after 10 min but hey! What the hell"
5,Excellent,This movie brings back the best in cinema. A great story about a child figuring things out on his own.. and finding good people to help him along the way...
2,not my favorite,"I got this along with Big Game Hunter and thought the movements and controls would be about the same as Big Game Hunter, but it is, to me, a little less fun. You can't ""look around"" with just a simple movement of the remote, you have to use the nunchuck control to do so. I'm not a big video game player, so for me, there was just too much going on with both hands just to look around and see where the ducks are coming from. But that is just my opinion. I just might not be coordinated enough."
5,Excellent read,"Winning Angels is a ""must read"" for anyone in the VC world and a great guidebook for anyone wanting to break into the VC world. The book is clear and concise. Ideas/concepts are clearly explained with the aid of great graphs and charts. In addition, Howard and Dave have not only drawn from their expansive knowledge on the subject, but also from other experts in the field."
2,Fell apart after first use,"This suitcase fell apart on me after a SINGLE use on one vacation - two non-stop flights. This didn't face a lot of wear and tear, yet it fell apart anyway. Don't bother buying this crap. Either buy the really cheap stuff that you know will fall apart anyway or spring for the nicer range of luggage that you know will last..."
2,"superficial, stereotypical view of Bosnian war","This flick has all the sophistication of a music video. It is basically an excuse for the director to show guys getting drunk and shooting off guns in a village in flames at night time, while Yugoslav rock music blares. The relationship between the Serb and Muslim boyhood-friends-turned-enemies should be the crux of the movie but it is never adequately explored.It is no different than every other movie on the Bosnian war, with the exception of No Man's Land. It does not show the geopolitical situation of the time or the machinations of elites but rather assumes the bloodshed was the result of ancient or grassroots ethnic hatreds. Obviously there were ""ordinary"" Croatians, Serbians, and some Bosniacs involved in atrocities, but this is only part of the story.I got the feeling that this is the kind of movie made by a director who spent the early 1990s in Germany."
2,"Disappointing, depressing","I'm a big fan of both Once and the Swell Season. When I saw that there was a documentary about them with rave reviews, I ordered it immediately. While the DVD has some nice concert footage and some insights into their life, it was generally slow-paced, jumpy and rather depressing as their relationship slowly ends. There were such large gaps in the filming sessions that the film lost some of its continuity. One of the big problems for me was that I read so many positive reviews of this documentary, I went into it with very high expectations."
1,No captioning!,"Buyer beware! Even though the product page and the DVD cover itself says the movie has closed captioning, it does NOT. Would not have purchased it had the labeling and identification been correct. Can't speak to the film itself as I wasn't able to watch it, but from the other reviews it sounds wonderful which makes this all the more frustrating."
5,One of the best old school/bass rideout cd's ever produced!!,"This cd has some of the greatest songs from back in the day. It is well worth your money. I would recommend this cd to all of my friends. I ""moonlight"" as a dj in my spare time. When I first started I would've been in a tight squeeze without this cd because then I didn't realize that to be a good dj one must have an extensive collection of cd's from a wide range of styles and artists. Fortunately for me, this is one of the first cd's that I ever bought and it came in very handy."
4,Nice but It'll break if you use it daily,"I bought this for my sister this past christmas with two pendants from this seller.She likes the bracelet (I do also) but she's about to break it (and it's been less than a month since she's using it).In fairness, she clamps the bracelet to her wrist every time, thus forcing it and therefore (eventually) breaking it.Overall it's nice, but it has some issues regarding endurence."
4,Good Intentions - Could have been better.,"The Book seemed to be a reflection of the ""Cosmic Science"" I had discussed with my parents & siblings since Childhood.. The Author is well versed in Physical science but sometimes mis-interprets the Vedic phrases leaving ""mush to be desired""... For example, in the Purusha Surta, there is a verse saying the ""Legless purusha Attained legs""; well the word for leg in sanskrit is ""paada"" meaning part. So the sentense would be, the undivided had divided itself... That would be close to a rational mind.Also, the use of the term ""God"" is a no-no when explaining the RGveda. Purusha denotes the ABSOLUTE.On the whole, I would call it a Very welcome step in explaining the Vedas. The forthcoming versions might see a lot of corrections :)"
5,A very thought-provoking book,"I've always been interested in this subject matter ever since I saw Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos"" miniseries (where he mentions Hinduism's approach to cosmology). Unfortunately we ordinary people overlook and thus miss out on deeper meanings in our own books. The Rg Veda is the heritage not only of Hinduism, but of all humanity. Roy's interpretations were, to say the least, mind-blowing. I was fascinated and read the book in a day. I can't wait to read it again. There are a lot of Sanskrit words, but the ""glossary"" at the end was a very helpful reference. Whether you agree with him or not, this book is written by a brilliant scholar and his research is very thorough. I have recommended this book to other friends and relatives of mine, so I can have someone to discuss it with! I urge you also to read it, esp. if you are from India, it will make you proud."
3,joined by Tommy Flanagan,"Flanagan was making some great music around time (1960), including his own trio record a month earlier. His later date with Coleman Hawkins (1962, Today and Now) is similar to this record, but better (more interesting tunes, Hawk's more interesting vocabulary)."
5,Great crime fiction,"I am on a Jim Thompson reading binge. I read in the last month The Killer Inside Me, Pop 1280, A Hell of A Woman, and The Grifters..........all are masterpieces; yet, The Grifters is by far my favorite. I love the Greek tragedy aspect of the book. I love the dime store Dostoevsky in all his facets; it astounds that he wrote high levels of literature for a pulp fiction audience. I have read much of Cain and Chandler; Thompson blows them away. He is the greatest American crime fiction writer after Poe. If you have not read him, you are missing quite a literary experience."
3,not the film Welles intended,"The intial running time to this film was 150 minutes! The studio took the film out of Welles control and deleted over an hour of essential material. Welles had made a film-noir masterpiece of cinematic lighting and extreme camera angles within this genre. The final halls-of-mirrors set-piece lasted 20 minutes and in the studio version just last for a minute. This is a ruined film and maybe one day film historians might recover the 150 minute original version and release it to the general public on blu-ray! The 87 minute version has moments of genius with hypnotic visuals and I can't help but think that films like THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI and TOUCH OF EVIL would go on to influence filmmakers such as Brian De Palma. THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI and TOUCH OF EVIL Welles comes off looking like a carnival huckster operating in sleazy, sordid gutter town. The 150 minute version must come to light and experience an essential masterpiece."
4,Not Welles' best but still very good,"This film is memorable for a couple of extraordinary scenes as well as Welles working with his wife, Rita Hayworth. Did this guy have a fortunate young life or what!"
3,Not high enough,The waist cincher doesn't go high enough to really be effective. It creates a back bulge. I ordered larger than I would really wear hoping that I would go bra level. Not the case! I'm about 5'3 - 160 lbs I ordered size 3-4
4,Vintage Bantock but not a step-by-step book,"I enjoyed Urgent 2nd Class because it was put together by Nick Bantock, who charmed me with the Sabine series and the Artful Dodger and others too numerous to mention. His images are multilayered and artful. He does talk about how some images were made (ephemera, Bantock-designed rubber stamps) but he does not show you step by step how to accomplish any particular image. And his ephemera may not be available to the average person. He does by from dealers in Vancouver BC, giving him an advantage over those in small towns.This is not a shortcoming, however, if you have other books that show you the construction and layering of stuff. The beauty of Bantock lies in his imagination, his imagination. He does encourage the reader to use their own, and that's a gift."
1,God and Mammon,"According to the author, at least so I surmise, the Catholic Church is now no more than a huckster for the crass Anti-Christ materialism and vulgarity of the West. Who are the prime sources for this 'Catholic' writer? the Protestant materialist von Mises and the materialist Jew Murray Rothbard--their opinions on this are of no value. Nowhere are statements from many popes condemning capitalist morality (or lack thereof). And to deny that the Faith has no business in judging the white-collar criminals or their political whores in deranging the country and looting it for their own greed and amorality is tantamount to right-wing Marxism. Let me be quite clear on this: No Christian of any integrity should give their allegiance to our Anti-Christ economy and the government of paid lackeys that panders to it."
4,Classic.,Classic scent for men that never goes out of style. It's a bit older but honestly I always get a new bottle when mine runs out. Great cologne.
4,Average smelling colonge.,Wanted to try out Curve colonge for once and it does smell good but hardly noticable but the smell doesnt last long....
3,A bit disappointed,"I left my original charger at a hotel while on the road. I bought this so I didn't have to leave my PC on all night to charge my phone. It works for that, but did not come with the adapter that hooks the cord straight to my phone. This cord plugs into the USB cradle that came with my phone. So I have to charge the phone from the cradle (which I could already do with the PC on and the USB cord plugged in, however, now i don't have to leave my PC on and the phone charges much more quickly. But, it would be nice if it would have come with the adpter so I had a way to charge the phone when traveling."
2,Go see a good doctor,I was suffering greatly and desided to try Venapro. I ordered the product on a Monday and the next day decided to make an appointment with a colon/rectal specialist due to the immense pain. I saw the doctor on the Friday of the same week. The doctor did a prodedure in the office that took all of 20 minutes and I was out of there with no medication to take and only a slight discomfort for a couple of days. I still have not received the Venapro as of a week from ordering it. I would recommend seeing a board certified colon and rectal specialist first if possible before buying this or any product if your problem / pain is serious. The doctor's knowledge and expertise was a blessing for me.
3,venopro hemorrhoid relief,"the product venapro hemorrhoid relief was ok, but when i recieved my purchased order the cap on the hemorrhoid bottle was loose and it was 1/4 full......product was ok, but bottle was 1/4 th full. the venapro colon health supplement was satisfactory because in capsule form, but the liquid bottle of venapro 1/4 full was a terrible because almost empty."
2,Not for everyone,"I think what it boils down to is that Venapro works magic for some folks and wastes the money of others. I found it affordably on Amazon and thought that the good reviews overrode the bad and so tried it out. It has been over two weeks with ZERO results. My condition isn't what you would call severe, just inconvenient. At the same time I began taking Venapro, I also enacted some lifestyle changes: drinking lots of water, taking a fiber supplement, icing the area, using Tucks pads, taking ibuprofen to reduce swelling, and eating healthy foods. Even after all of this, I still have not noticed a difference. Maybe I am just a tough case, and like I said, maybe Venapro is a life saver for some folks. Just not for me. No adverse side effects, though."
3,For gamers,"This was an immensely popular independent internet series, years ago, for gamers. It is fun even if you don't game, but you may not get it."
1,Stupid: Watching This is Torture,"5 min and 25 seconds of life wasted:I skipped the cheesy intro after the first 10 seconds (annoying music) and fast forwarded to 1:15. Then watched to 6:40. This is a piece of garbage. I wouldn't watch this if they paid me. Perhaps the ***** should show this video as torture to bad guys and other miscreants.Can't believe all the positive review. Truly, society as we know it is currently in a downward spiral for generations to come."
4,Laughs for all,"Having never played Halo myself there might be somethings that escape me but this is still a great way to kill an hour.The humor is great, the characters are engaging and, in an exaggerated sense, believable. The sound quality leaves a little to be desired but keep in mind it started as a fun internet series."
4,Red vs Blue Volume 1,Fun Series. I just with the language was toned down a bit. If the language wasn't so rough I'd give it 5 stars.
2,Invisible thread,More like Fishing wire. I couldn't put a knot at the end of my thread. They are just so hard to use. Its not very user Friendly at all.
4,An almost perfect drill,"I don't know where the Amazon review is coming from, but I would never call this drill 'light'. It is heavy even without the battery pack. It has replaced my corded 3/8"" Skill as my main drill, but it very difficult to use overhead unless you are also a body builder. Batteries charge quickly and retain a charge for a very long time, both in the case and in use. Only criticism besides weight is that the switch to move between the three speed ranges will sometimes bind."
5,As Much Fun As You Can Legally Have,"Kacey Jones, whether ""live"" or on CD is about as much fun as you can have without getting arrested ! I bought this CD on a whim and enjoyed it immediately. By a strange twist of fate, the Nashville-based singer / songwriter / humorist / producer / arranger was appearing in my area within days of purchasing the CD. Her live show was a blast ! Kacey has a great sense of humor, although she can turn out a great ""serious"" tune equally well. Her arrangements cover many different styles of music, so there's a little something to please many different tastes. I've since acquired all of her CDs and recommend anything she puts out. If Kacey records it, I'll buy it ! Check out her website at: www.KaceyJones.com for more info on this very, very funny and talented performer."
5,I want to see this on Broadway!!,"This CD had me laughing and dancing and singing along the very first time I listened to it. Now I want to see it on Broadway -- Sweet Potato Queens' Big-Ass Broadway Review! It did seem like two tracks (I Don't Want Someone Like You and Give Me a Chance) were out of place here. They are good torch songs but don't match the rollicking, happy-in-my-own-skin attitude of the other tracks. I know I'll be buying other CDs from this performer."
5,THE BEST EVER,"This is by far the most valuable book I own!""The Common Sense"" is a set of incremental writing notions that can lead ANY writer toward mastery of the essay. It harnesses the innate power of language and the fundamental shape of one's attention rather than relying of prescriptives. Throughout the U.S., composition teachers in classrooms use this as their text book--the only one they need. A syllabus is in the back of the book. The Teacher accompaniment to this book is ""Beat Not the Poor Desk""--the second most valuable book I own."
3,Ok frog cookie cutter,"This frog cookie cutter is pretty good. It is good quality and a cute overall shape. However, the feet are so tiny that when I made cookies with it, the feet kept breaking off."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"In these stories of escape from maritime disasters, Chatham paints vivid portraits of human heroism in the face of danger. Based largely on survivor interviews, these true stories made me feel the hopes and fears of people facing incredible odds. Chatham gives us the hard facts culled from official investigation reports but concentrates on the human element. His gripping writing and expert story telling made this book impossible to put down!"
4,HL-1440 good and easy,"The Brother HL-1440 is inexpensive, easy to use and fast. The only down side is the the replacement drum is expensive to replace, but I bought a refurbished one that also comes with a cartridge for less than $100."
2,Why bother?,"Many brief entries--a paragraph or so--random items (most fairly uninteresting). I didn't find them weird or wacky; I knew many of the items and didn't care much about the others.I'm not sure what the audience is, but apparently it wasn't me."
4,Pleasantly surprised,I've had the dvd for over two months and this week I decided to take a break from Leslie Sansone. It was nice to see other women my size working up a sweat. But on the one which uses weights her form is not good and she swings her arms too much. It is not a problem for me since in the past I used to workout so I know good form. But for a beginner just be carefull when using weights. Debra is normal and down to earth and she does not talk too much which is great being that I exercise at 5am. Overall I enjoyed the break for Leslie and will add this to my workout schedule.
4,Daily Mirror is a stronger album,"I believe that the Rebekka Bakken-Wolfgang Muthspiel collaboration Daily Mirror (with guests Chris Cheek, Scott Colley, and Brian Blade) is a stronger album than this one. Daily Mirror is not available at www.amazon.com though. Go to www.materialrecords.com for details."
3,cakes-a-crumbly,"i love the rice cakes and have been ordering them for over a year now but...1 out of four times i recieve them,about half are broken and crumbling!i've never complained or returned them but i wonder if there is something that can be done about this?"
3,clerk/typist study guide,The manual helped with the kind of information that would be on the test but the questions were kind of about outdated products that aren't used now. It did help to go through it to get a general idea of what kind of questions would be on the test.
4,Great little speakers!,"Compact, cute, functional, and clear, crisp sound... Not going to bother the neighbors, but loud enough to enjoy your music."
1,Is this compatible with a 2nd generation ipod touch?,Can I use this for my 2nd generation ipod touch? I'm still waiting for this one to come and I was wondering if this will works for my ipod touch.
2,My experience may be unique but,".... maybe because it's first generation;(1) It's a complete battery hog in spite of A-L's claims for long life. AA's last a couple of hours at most. Get rechargeable batteries, but even then you may have problems(2) 9 volt power plug-in doesn't work. I Had to call A-L for a replacement(3) I bought some rechargeable high-power NiMH batteries at the suggestion of A-L customer support. It' still not enough power. The unit auto shuts-off after 3 minutes.(4) It's going back to A-L for replacement. They are giving me a full replacement. Hopefully, it will work better.(5) Sound is very good...when it worksA-L support was great, but overall, I am not happy with this product."
5,inMotion speakers for ipod mini,I recentley purchased these wonderful speakers in an apple store located in Miami Forida . these are the best speakers ever. they are the perfect companion for your ipod mini. These speakers have great sound value and are worth the 130 bucks. They have great bass and just look kool im listening to greenday on them rite now cool item check it out
4,Wish it was cloth over vinyl,I bought this bib and it serves the purpose of keeping my son's clothes clean...I just wish it was cloth. He doesn't seem to like the material and if it were cloth I think he would be more comfortable with it on.
4,Good Bib!,"Good bib. The bib protects the shirts from food. The crumb catcher isn't a good as a scoop bib, but it's worth it since all the shirts don't end up stained. The bib can be a little challenging to tie on a wiggly toddler with long hair. Overall great quality."
5,"Handy Dandy Saving ""Machine""","This saves your baby's clothes from a lot of nasty stains and you from a lot of unnecessary cleanup. It fits over wrists with a nice, elastic band and is easy to put on. It must be fairly comfy to because my girl doesn't try to take it off, nor could she if she tried-unlike some of the reg bibs. I'm VERY happy i got this bib, esp for spaghetti nights!!!"
3,Wrong design,I love these bibs they keep my little girl so clean my only problems are that the collar is a little loose (not all babies are big mine is a little peanut) and the wrong design showed up at my door yes it was purple and yes it had flowers on it but it was not what was on the site it was completely different
2,Not what I expected,"I found this bib to be very hard to get on/off. The material has no give and makes it hard when you have a squirming child you are trying to get it on. I also found that after several washing mold started to develop inside the pocket area. I was able to get it out, but it would be nice if the pocket area opened up. I did find a bib at Angelic Baby Creations that had a pocket the opened up and was a regular fabric and easy to wash/care for."
5,Salieri's best CD to date.....,This recording is so great that allI can say to you is this: buy it...
3,Not a disk one loves right away.,"I'm hoping it will grow on me. Not likely, between Bartoli's singing and the noise-like arias."
5,cajun tradition - instrumental,This is good simple cajun music no singing some fast songs some slow songs very nice to just listen to or use as nice back ground music lots of accordion and fiddle. I will use this at our first 4th of july family bbq cook off.
2,Don't Water It Down!,"This was a great attempt as a tribute, but there is nothing like the real thing. This is a watered down version of the full-bodied product done by the artist himself. The artist conveyed all the flavor in his renditions which is not better served by taking the that full-bodied rendering out and leaving essentially a half-dressed presentation. It was like having decaffienated when you can have espresso instead. Mr. Blunt keep bringing on the power and feeling. You give us that full flavor every time!"
5,Great Introductory Book,"For a subject which has so much potential to be conveyed in complicated and esoteric ways, this book actually manages to present every single chapter in a clear and accessible way, even for those unfamiliar with formal logic.It doesn't cover every single theorem you might come across in a first year class, but it comes close. I'd thoroughly recommend this book, even for self-study. I've used a couple of texts for this subject and while none of them are actually bad, this one is streets ahead for understandability and clarity."
3,Alright job,"The product arrived slightly later than the description specified, but it was in excelent condition and is going to great use."
5,excellent background,Nice variety of instrumentals. Includes well known songs with a nice mix of sax and other instruments. Easy and pleasant to listen too.
3,"A little dated, but the core principles still apply","Nice review of the development of the use of computers in medicine. Great first hand accounts. Seems a little dated to me now, but the principles used to initiate 'cybermedicine' are well presented."
5,Suprised by durability!,"I purchased 3 of these SD/256 cards to go with my digital camera. While out walking the river, one of the cards slipped from my pocket and landed submerged in a puddle beside the stream...(I carry my extra cards with me because I also shoot video on my camera, which eats up space fast).. The small plastic case was partially open on one corner, so it immediately filled with water. I brought the card home, and figuring it was ruined anyway, rinsed it off under the faucet. After laying the card up and allowing it to dry out for several days, I plugged it in, and suprisingly, it not only still worked, but also still held my past pictures which were stored on it! Because it survived this abuse, I have to say 5 stars, and I will personally look toward this brand in the future!"
5,Worth the money,"My husband and I both thought $40 was too much for a diaper bag, but after looking at it, we decided it was well worth the money. It has lots of extras, and it does fit easily in the bottom of the stoller if you put it sideways. If your looking to use the bottom of the stoller as a storage bin, then you may need a smaller bag, but we are still able to put the bag in the bottom of it along with a few extra things at the same time. The size came in especially handy when we travelled. The quality is outstanding and have gotten lots of comments on how nice it looks too!"
4,Fascinating read,Rachel MacNair has had the courage to examine topics in our society that we shy away from. It is a fascinating and at times disturbing read. Well worth the purchase if one has contact with or works with perpetrators.
3,Incredibly easy to set up!,"I purchased this for my cousin so that she would be able to access the internet anywhere in her apartment. It was incredibly easy to set-up, I simply followed their color-coded instructions (haha, it seems that they are trying to make it as fool-proof as possible) and their software did the rest. I do suggest changing the routers administrative log-in after the automated configuration is complete, but other then that, it does not require nearly any technical experience.Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a product that is easy to set-up, and fairly reliable. For a more advanced and reliable router, I suggest theLinksys-Cisco WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router (Compatible with Linux)which can also have thrid-party firmware uploaded into it for more customization."
1,"Last about 1 year, no longer . . .",Over the past 2 years I have owned two 614's. After 12 months the first one suddenly died. Now the one I paid for as a replacement has died after about 9 months. NetGear stuff tends to work fine for the one year warranty period. Then they die. Maybe they have a built in timer set to kill it 300+(a random number) of days after you turn it on. I am not going to buy another one.
1,Awful customer service with this router,I forgot my password. They told me I needed to pay to retrieve the password! Never buy a router from Netgear. They have the worst customer service.
1,Old Router,Got them in and they are an older revision and not the latest ones out.I guess they have to clear the warehouses someway but not without some notice and not at this close to the regular price for the latest revision elsewere.Not as happy as I'd like to be.1 star but only because these are new old stock.Would have been 5 stars for latest revision.
4,Very good Router for the money.,I haven't had any problems with this router. It even works in the back yard and the router in in the front of the house.
2,constantly disconnects & cuts speed,"Own two of these in separate homes, both version 6 -- both have to constantly be reset/power-cycled because the wireless connection goes dead. Have also noticed in one home that the speed of our cable internet is being cut in half. Directly connected to the modem, speed tests indiciated ~4800kbps, directly connected to the router ~2500kbps, and wireless through the router ~1700kbps."
1,Frustrated and Disappointed,"I was happy with how easy it was to install this router. I got such a great deal (too good to be true?) for $33 plus tax at Best Buy. However, once installed, I started having problems with my internet connection (no connection). I tried tech support who emailed me- #1. Connect router to the internet. I did not have an active internet connection with the router connected b/c of the router which I had mentioned in my email for assistance. Poor all around for someone who is an intermediate when it comes to computer repair."
1,piece of crap. Huge disappointment.,Bought this a month ago.. started having problems with dropped and slow as hell connections after a few weeks of using it. The unit gets really hot even though I have it in an open space. I shouldn't have to intall a fan just to get this P.O.S. to work. I should have listened to prior reviews.Your 40 bucks is better invested into a stable router that actually does its job. Don't be fooled by a cheap price and nice case design if it DOESN'T WORK right.Never Netgear.
1,Failed to work after one year,"It worked well until a little bit after a year --- their warranty time. Called them but was told that if the wired part works, the wireless should work too. I used it as a wired router then for another 4 months. And the wired connection is now getting intermittently interrupted. It's a piece of junk!"
2,Drops Connection every 5 min,"I have this router for over an year now and as the time progressed, the router's performance has deteriorated. As of today, it drops connection every 5 minutes. I have heard similar complaints from my co-workers about this router.I would not recommend this product."
1,"Good set of features, unreliable, horrible RMA service.","First of all, I used to be a Netgear fan. WGR614, just like MR814 has the exact set of features I ever needed. Unfortunately, the product died (now it would not even power up - even though I've got a surge protector) a month after I've got it. Shipped it to the RMA center overnight, and haven't got back for three weeks. Keep calling them every other day, and every time they say that the product was on backorder, but they will ship it overnight today. Needless to say, they don't keep their word.Lesson learned."
1,One of the Worst routers I have ever had,"In short their techinical support only works from text books and have no clue how to resolve problems, they are rude and degrading. Customer support does not return phone calls or emails. Easily hacked into by anyone with a basic computer understanding, leaving all your confidential information vulnerable. Nothing but a headache, and problem. RUN away fast from any Netgear product.I got a Linksys router and have been very happy with it and my security."
1,Horrible customer service,"Super easy set-up but 11 months later this router stopped working. It started shutting down and restarting all the time. I updated the firmware and still the same issue. I called customer support and they walked me through some set-up tweaks. The router worked for two-weeks and then same problems. They called a couple of times but I missed their calls. I called them back and they walk me through the same set-up and firmware upgrades I've already done. The router worked while i was on the phone (of course). They told me if I still had problems that I could just called back to have it replaced. Of course, one week later the router stops working again, and they never called to check on it so I called on what happened to be the day that was exactly one year from the purchase date (dec 18, 2006 to dec 18, 2007). They told me it was out of warranty now and they could not do anything unless I wanted to pay for support. I'm shopping around for a better router now."
1,Netgear WGR614,"The router is good when it works. If you are going to buy a netgear product, call support as if you bought this and needed support or to return.Dumb phone support selections, called several times and every time I when I reached someone they who spoke bad english. You may need to repeat the simpliest question several times. The phone connection always seemed bad. The service/return policies are stupid, even with a warranty. Try this and you will see why any netgear product is worth 1 star, maybe."
4,Good enough,"My home is all ethernet so I have little use for wireless most of the time. I purchased this to have when working on family and friends units and need to test the wifi. Speed and range are of little import to me. Both are adequate. The user interface is the standard browser set up and works well with Firefox. It set up just fine and has worked well for all the Windows OS systems. Some flavors of Linux are a pain to get working but I suspect that is more of a WLAN driver issue than with this router. My networking expertise is very basic. One hint, if you forget your passwords, they can be reset to factory defaults by pressing a recessed button while the unit is powered on."
2,"Good Product, Don't expect you're rebate","I bought this router about 9 monthes ago. I chose Netgear because they are fairly cheap and still a decent company. I could have purchased a 3com router for approximately the same price, but went to with the WGR614 because of the mail in rebate. After recieving this router I mailed in the rebate. After checking online my rebate was not accepted due to the fact that I did not submit a reciept. I did in fact send in my amazon invoice, but I guess that isn't good enough. I'm not sure what else they could want. If you buy from Amazon just don't expect to get you're rebate. Other than that, this is a great product."
2,Not a stable router,"I used comcast high speed internet and have had Linksys router, I was never disappointed. Then I bought this and wanted to get rid of it after several days of use. It lost connection every several days and I had to unplug the power and restart it. Also itdoesn't allow me to use BT. It would just go dead once I start a BT software. I may just have a bad luck but I just don't recommand this product."
5,5 minute setup,"It took me 5 minutes to convert wired LAN into a wireless LAN with this router. The configuration wizard is *very* easy to use. With in 5 minutes, I was out on my deck, surfing the web with out an ethernet cable attached to my laptop."
4,Slick looking device with a catch,"This netgear router is a good unit. Its small in size, light weight, and looks very stylish. The only problem I had when installing was a password lock code I did not know. I had to call their tech service. After about 10 min. of waiting they informed me the password is ""password"". Duh. After that everthing was pure gravey. Works great now. I've had it for about one month."
4,So far so good,"I haven't experienced the same disconnection problems as mentioned in other posts. I use Wireless occasionally and am mostly connected directly to it from my PC. I am running the Firmware prior to version 1.0.11 and it has so far performed great. In reply to K. Poole's review, PPTP does work if you configure Port Forwarding for port 1723 to the internal PPTP client's IP address.."
4,"easy setup, good price, lousy support","This router is a breeze to setup and configure, however I was unlucky enough to call Netgear support. I was able to configure the router with my cable modem in a matter of minutes and had it up and working. It appears to be fairly easy to set up filters and services as well. I was losing a fair bit of network throughput when connecting my pc to a cable modem via the router. That was my question to the donkies at Netgear support. Five stars on the modem and a minus one on the support = 4 stars."
3,Easy setup. Will freeze with high transfer rates.,"I have this router for about 4 years. Setup is really easy. Web-based admin application is very user friendly.The major problem is the router will freeze with high transfer rates and high volumes. This happens only with wireless transfers. There is no problem at all with wired transfers. Problem is prominent with P2P software, or other high volume transfers, like try viewing Google maps.The solution is to cycle-power the router. The absence of a power switch is annoying, you have to remove the power jack to cycle-power the router.One long-term solution proposed in several discussion forums is to cut open the top of the plastic enclosure and place a fan blowing onto the wireless chip heatsink. I have not tried it, but noticed that when the router freezes, the heatsink is extremely hot. Most likely a thermal problem."
2,Was nice while it lasted,"I bought and installed version 6 of this device a couple of years ago. On the positive side, it was easy to install and it offered a reasonable set of features, if not everything I wanted. However, in the last two days, it has been going out to lunch for no reason that I can see: while the unit shows activity on its Internet and wireless LEDs, and it continues to show up in a scan for wireless networks, it will not issue DHCP leases on the LAN side, and it will not respond to ICMP pings from either the WAN or the LAN sides. Rebooting the box clears the problem, but this is not an acceptable solution. Since NetGear says my support options all involve me paying money, I expect to buy a new wireless router with a different brand label."
1,MISTAKE! Do NOT Buy This Product!!,"This router worked for just over a year; I just spent almost an hour troubleshooting with them on the phone, only for them to tell me that it has ""gone bad"" and there is nothing they can do about it!!! I asked to speak to a supervisor, and they still refused to help. They acknowledged that their product went bad but said because it had been more than a year (2 months over a year), they are not liable.I will never buy another Netgear product again, and I am filing a claim with my credit card company (GO AMERICAN EXPRESS! At least THEY were sympathetic and are going to refund my money)."
2,Good when it worked,"This router provided ok wireless at my grandparents house when it worked, then one day the power went out. When the power came back on no internet connection, computer and printer showed no network connecting at all. When I looked at the router every light but the power was out. Tried resetting it, no luck. Total life was just over 2 years."
5,Netgear Wireless G router,I bought this in February. Kept it ever since and surprisingly still works. Most of the reviews of this product said that they all go bad after a month of use! Mine still works great and the price is very cheap.
5,Easy hook up for a technologically illiterate person,I found the software that was provided to show installation was very easy to understand and I have not had any problems. I connected it to a computer in the basement and I can use it on the first floor wih an excellent connection. Very good connection on 2nd floor. I have a very good connection outside in my front and back yards.
1,THIS IS A HORRIBLE PRODUCT,"I installed it easily enough, but nothing worked. I couldn't connect to VPN network and web pages crawled. I had to upgrade the firware out of the box and that helped with the VPN, but the only way to surf the web with any normalcy was to disable the firewall features.What a piece of trash. I returned it and bought a linksys."
5,"Great, easy to use Router!","I read reviews that were positive and negative for this router before getting a good price and deciding to buy it. Out of the box, the Netgear installation wizard was a breeze to use. Installing the router took under 10 minutes. I must say though, having the security settings on a seperate website was a tad more time consuming, but overall quite self explanatory. I live in a 2 storey house with brick walls and have the router next to a windoww, a source of signal 'leakage'. I still get good range and signal levels downstairs at the opposite end of the house. Overall, the router does everything i need and is easy enough for just about any consumer to set up and use."
4,Netgear Router Review,"The product is very reliable now that it has been set up. However, the installation cd was worthless and I had to get an IT person I knew to install it for me."
2,Lots of connectivity problems: new Linksys router fixed them,"We used this router without problems for years. Then, a month ago wireless connections started dropping. It got worse and worse: MacBook, XP, Vista, iPhone, and wireless printer all started having problems. I upgraded firmware, but that didn't fix anything.Last night I went out and bought the latest Linksys WRT54G2 Wireless-G Broadband Router. That fixed everything. In addition, the Linksys router comes with Network Magic software, which sounds hokey, but which does such a great job at organizing and managing the network I can forgive the name."
1,"If you want a play a complete game, never touch netgear","I am telling the true thing which happened to me.I was a super gamer until i bought netgear router. The router disconnects constantly, about twice every hour. I lost my job from the clan because i could not play games well. And the most horrible thing is that it disconnected while i was purchasing the stocks and lost me about $2,000. I decided to buy another brand of router without any hesitation. And i am so happy for what i have done. Netgear,never want to see you again."
3,Sometimes needs rebooting,"I have had this router for 6 months. It never drops the wired connection to which most of my computers are hooked up. But the wireless has issues. Sometimes my laptop can't connect anymore. I haven't figured out why, except that rebooting the wireless router fixes the problem, so I'm pretty confident it's an issue with the router.I have also had problems doing large file transfers (>100 MB) from one of my LAN machines to the laptop over wireless. The file kept getting corrupt and couldn't be unpacked, despite having been transferred entirely. Comparison between the source and destination showed errors. I'm not certain if the router was at fault, Vista, or the wireless driver on the laptop. But I do know that when the laptop was hooked up to the LAN via Ethernet directly, the file transferred properly - not to mention much faster."
3,Great for PC's but not game stations,"This router is great if you are simply setting up a wireless with PC's, but it does not work well with the Sony Playstation2. It refuses to allow the USB headset to work in online play. This is after setting up a DMZ, port forwarding, etc.If it worked for PS2, I would highly recommend it."
4,"Easy Install, Works Fine","I thought that the installation for this would be horrific but it was very easy. The step by step instructions were easy to follow. About 10 minutes later I was surfing the internet without wires!One complaint that I have seen a lot of is when the router just stops. This was very aggrevating because I didn't know what was going on. After reading some the reviews and following the instructions some people gave, I went to Netgear's web site and downloaded the most recent firmware for the product and that seems to be working just fine!"
5,Please don't waste your money,"The customer service is a misnomer. You can't understand anything they say. If you have to call back more than twice, they charge. Please buy anything else."
1,Don't use it with a Macintosh!,"I purchased this router to use with a pc laptop (wireless) and a Mac connected via ethernet to the router. The PC works great, but the Mac and the router will not communicate properly. I've spent several hours talking with some very nice Indian folks on the phone about this, but each time there was no resolution to the problem. I've given up trying to solve the problem and just plug the Mac directly into my cable modem, then unplug it and plug the router in when I need to use the laptop. Of course, that sort of defeats the purpose of the router!"
1,Useless and no support,Doesn't work and can't even logon to support site probably from all the victims I mean customers trying to complain / get some help. Do not buy mine is going in the trash.
5,Netgear WGR614 Router,"After a hassle with Hawking over A RMA for a bad router, I decided to purchase the Netgear. It installed very easy and quick. I was and still am very happy. It has more range tha any of the previous Routers I have used including Linksys and Hawking."
5,Great Compact Router,"If you're looking for a slim and sleek router that won't make your desk look like a runway at night, then this is the one. Not only does it look great, but it works great too. The small size and polished look do not take away from the performance of this product. It works almost anywhere in the house. I will definitely purchase other netgear products for my wireless needs in the future."
4,Great for the price,"Installation was not easy. I followed the instructions, but that took me nowhere. I then contacted customer service. The tech I talked to led me through the installation and after about 15 minutes I was connected. The router works great! I get very good range and speed! I am happy with it. I would recommend anyone to call customer service before they return the router."
1,Defective - Terrible customer support,"I must say that I was pleased with the product while it lasted. Unfortunately this was only 1 month. At that point the we couldn't connect to the router via wireless (only by wired connection). Firmware upgrades were a no-go. It took me 8 calls (long distance - there is no 1-800 number) to customer support to talk to a real person and attempt to get an RMA, when they informed me their ""system was down"" and they would call me back. Regardless to say, they never did. The ""email"" support is a scam. They never responded to my emails either. The router now relegated for use as a network switch in my lab. Don't buy Netgear. Buy the D-Link 624 or similar instead."
2,Unreliable wireless connection,"I bought this router because of its ridiculously low price (...) And I too have heard good things about the Netgear brand. The device only took 2 minutes to set up with RCN's cable modem (dynamic ip), and the web config interface is simple. But the wireless connection dies intermittently, sometimes as often as several times a day! I have to go over to the router, unplug it, and plug it back in to reset it. Afterwards it works fine. If you're at home, it's a minor nuisance, but if you're running a server or need to connect to your network when nobody's home to reset the router, DON'T BUY THIS."
2,An Arm Wrestling Contest to Use with Devices/Computers/Printers,"I bought this on a whim, since I already had a Netgear 624 that was fine. The 614 would sometimes fail to connect devices/computers/printers, sometimes would show a 'low signal' at the device side, and would seldom recognize my HP wireless printer, so I moved everything back to my Netgear 624 which worked calmly and well. I think the 614 is higher powered in terms of signal, but its software or electronics or both are faulty. I developed a scheme: each day, power down the unit and power it back up, to keep signal strong, etc. My advice is: don't buy the 614, even if they give it away eventually. I don't know which wireless router to suggest since I'm only used the 624 and the 614. BEfore this I was wired with a Linksys that performed fine and stable for years and years. I don't know today who makes a solid wireless router. I suspect only one or two of them out there are truly solid and reliable."
2,My second buy and failing again,"I bought the second one after the first one died on me because it is very easy to set up (plug it in and it starts to work) and cheap.However, router has some serious heating problem (really, it's burning hot!)...And my second router is starting to failing again after a couple of month of use (random disconnection).If you reset by turning off for a while and restart it, it becomes ok.But after a day or two starts to fail again.In addition, can't even go to the router setup page for securing the router. Most of the time, it just redirects you to netgear's home page...Now, let's see if I get that random disconnection on submitting this review...Yup..."
2,Netgear is Nyet,"Second Netgear router I have had the misfortune to own.The first wasn't compatible with XP, and after months of struggle, it went into the garbage can.This router worked much better, setup was relatively easy, and then it died after 8 months of use.The LAN (wired) ports never worked correctly, and if I used the modem directly, there was not a problem, so it was clearly the router.Technical support is painful at best. At times I just hung-up to get another tech.Ultimately, you get what you pay for, and cheap is cheap."
1,Please do not purchase this product!,"I'm a Software Engineer with 7+ years of networking experience. Have installed dozens of routers and configured several corporate networks. I bought this product for personal use(WGR614v5) on January 30, 2005. After running the ""wizard"" everything worked as expected for 5 days. On the night of the 5th day, the connectivity to the internet was lost. I attempted many methods to regain access to the internet, without success. The unit simply won't work anymore. Furthermore, Netgear's ""support"" is almost nonexistent and not knowledgeable at all. Please do not purchase this product."
2,Can't get it to work.,"The Netgear wireless router product is apparently in working order because I mailed it to my son in Tennessee who got it to work just fine on his equipment which is the same as mine. Surely, I'm not so technically savvy as my son, but I can read and write and follow directions. The setting up of the equipment is quite complicated, in my view, far moreso than it should be. I've set up other peripherals with success, but this product is more than I can handle. I've followed the directions, over and over, and still the router doesn't connect. I've given up. Can't handle the frustration. By the way, I'm way over the age of 13. I have grandchildren over the age of 13."
2,Terrible Reliability,"The WGR614 (I own the v4) is a breeze to install. Use your web browser to set up the router and you're ready to go. Setup should take you no more than 10 minutes, and the instructions are thorough to help those new to networking.However, the reliability of this device is lacking. Frequently, on both a wired and wireless connection, the connection would drop or slow to unbearable speeds. The wireless range of the WGR614 is only decent, and although it operates under 802.11g, you're better off with a 802.11b router due to this device's dropped connections and frequent losses in speed (Although I would recommend getting another brand of 802.11g router above the 802.11b). I have multiple routers and would recommend the D-Link wired or wireless routers over the listed router.Although this router supports a decent amount of features, is fairly flexible configuration-wise, and easy to set up, these features fail to redeem the WGR614's sheer lack of reliability."
2,Not for Apple,"Don't bother with this thing if you have an Apple. The software that comes with it has a wizard for Windows but it leaves you hanging with a manual install for Apple, and you need all the crazy numbers that only an IT person would know. Never could get it to work so sent it back and got a Belkin, still had some problems but it has features that will work with an Apple and no numbers required."
5,Good Value,"Overall a good productSimple to setup, reasonably good forwarding and firewall optionsEasy configuration and installation.I recommend this product."
1,Unable to stop Wireless router from Broadcasting SSID,Although the documentation says that you can stop this product from broadcasting the SSID the option is not available when you try to do it. Netgear support has confirmed this is a problem and said that it is releasing new firmware but can't confirm the date. This is a very basic security feature that should be available on all wireless routers. I would not purchase until new firmware is released.
5,Rock solid,"This is one great router, easy step by step instructions on the cd. This router is fast and hangs on to the connection without any hickups.One of the best looking routers on the market with a great price from Amazon. I was a little un easy about networking with all the negative reviews from other users, but this router is really a no brainer."
5,"Easy to setup, super reliable","As a certified LAN-newbie, I was looking for a product that would be easy to setup and deliver performance. This product excels on both counts. I had absolutely no problems setting up this router, and it performs beautifully. My Linksys WPC55AG network card and Dell Truemobile devices have no problem connecting to the WAP. I am very satisfied with this purchase, and you can't go wrong with the mail-in rebate! Highly recommended."
1,Junk,"Have had this router for 1.5 years. It worked for a while, and then would periodically drop connections. Calling Netgear is great, if you have 1 hour to spend on hold. Once you get someone on the phone, they are rude, assume you are ignorant, and then, maybe will replace it. I was sent a replacement unit, and it had a huge crack on the front. I called Netgear, and they said if it works, why do you care? What? Anyway, got a replacement unit that was not cracked, and it worked for 1 month (probably someone else's return), and called Netgear. I was told to re-install the firmware. Again... what?? Who has ever heard of re-installing firmware? This router is junk, and I will not buy another Netgear product (although I have a switch of theirs, and it works fine). Bad products, bad service. Linksys or Airport here I come..."
3,"Setup Good, Power Supply Bad","Had this Router for about a year and it worked well. Setup was easy and it worked well with Xbox Live etc (had Open NAT which is important for some services). Routers are still not as easy to admin as they should be but the interface was decent.Unfortunately, the little 1amp power brick failed after about 1 year. I know this was the case after doing some a/b tests with another power supply.So, reliability was the only issue but that's a big issue. I gave it 3 stars because I may have just got a bad PS. Its also unfortunate that they (Netgear) does not seem to provide replacment parts for the router (at least I could not find a it) and if you go through normal retail channels it will cost you somewhere between $10 and $30 to get a replacement power supply."
4,"No hassle router, works like a charm, but ships with a US-only (110-120V) adapter!","This is an excellent router (my second one, for my mom - I already have one). Works like a charm, no hassles. Sure it doesn't have some of the frills that the more expensive linksys WRT54Gs do (like acting purely as a wireless-ethernet bridge with the internet gateway facility disabled), but for what it does it's really good.My *only* gripe with this router is that it does not ship with an international-capable power adapter (it's 110-120V only, not 110-240 like most other modern devices), so it's unusable anywhere outside the US without buying a new power adapter (or buying a downconverter)"
4,Good Product,So far so good. I'm not sure about it's reliability yet as I just got it but it works and was so easy to install.
3,Don't buy used,It works but I constantly have to pull out the plug and restart the router. It works well but I would recommend buying new.
1,Not compatible with PS3 or iPhone,"I really thought this would be a great product. But if you have an iPod Touch or iPhone, you'll often get ""unable to join network"" and if you have a PS3, you'll often get a 8013013D error. Even both our macs in the house couldn't connect. We've been through two of these and both have the same issue. We've replaced the PS3 and same error again. We've returned it, went with a Linksys WRT54G and have not had a single issue."
5,Emotional cripples looking for love in all the wrong places.,"As ususal with William Trevor, the story is all in the details. The book is short, but not a quick read or you'll miss what Trevor's revealing about his characters. All of them are emotionally damaged people looking for love in all the wrong places. The story centers around Thaddeus, a recent widower who is looking for a nanny for his infant daughter. Pettite, a young woman loaded with emotional scars, applies and is rejected for the job. However, she develops an obsession for Thaddeus that makes her dangerous.Even though all the characters have had loveless--and even abuse--childhoods, Trevor somehow avoids making them pathetic."
2,"Believable, but too much extra, stuff","Mr. Shirkey did a nobil act be telling of his experiences during the time of the UFO crash, However, the book gets too far away from the actual incident, I felt. On a personal basis I had trouble too many times holding interest..."
2,Copy-cat book,"I was disappointed with this book. It is almost exactly the same as ISBN: 0439087864, Scooby Doo and the Witches Ghost (which I think is good.) and I already have that book. A lot of the pictures in the two books are exactly the same and the story is pretty much the same. I thought this story would be a continuation of Scooby Doo and the Witches Ghost where the Hex girls got involved in some new mystery. Instead, I basically received the same book. Why buy the Hex Files copy when you can own the original? I'd also point out that the Editorial Review for this book is completely misleading. The Hex girls cast no spells on anybody. This is the original Witches Ghost story."
5,The Tramp for a New Generation,"Most have heard of Chaplin. Though many have not seen an entire movie of Chaplin's. This collection is a great way to expose and introduce a younger generation to the visual comic genius of Chaplin. Kids who happen to have a short attention span forget that Chaplin is B&W and silent when they watch this. That's how good he is. This collection brings honor to Chaplin's greatest achievements by presenting the movies with superior picture quality. The extra featues are great! This is a ""must-have"" for any DVD enthusiast."
5,have to see atleast once in life time,"Beautiful and poetic, addresses human condition and speaks language of humanity sans all boundaries we have created for ourselves. Have to see it atelast once in life time.Some of the memorable things arehow apu's mom is denied love the same way she denies the old womanhow apu dozes off when his mom was asking him if he would take care of him in futurethe train scenethe rain, absolutely poeticthe old woman, cannot forget her facehow apu throws off the necklace into the pondrelationship between apu and sharila tagoredespite repeated blows of loosing loved ones, apu moves onCannot forget someof the scenes in the movie esp pather panchali (song of road), some of them kinda haunt meesp Pather panchali ( song of the road ) was beautiful"
3,"Eye-catching, previously neglected information","Russ Kick has a knack for eye-catching, previously neglected information. There are 36 Corporations That Ripped of the U.S. Government (led by HCA, ripping off America's Health Care System in spectacular fashion). Another: 36 Botched Executions, complete with gory details. How about: 19 Suicide Notes (Male, 74. ""I married the wrong nag-nag-nag and I lost my life."") One of my favorites: The 9 US Companies Allowed to Manufacture Illegal Drugs (The Polaroid Corporation makes a powerful psychedelic amphetamine - who knew?)The book is great taken a few lists at a time over a month or two."
3,Good but a bit sad.,"I love Gordon Lightfoot but let's face it he's older now and his voice is gone.It almost doesn't sound like the same person. I wish they would release some old concerts from the 70's. There dosen't seem to be a whole lot of concert footage of Gordo out there.Still he's one of my favorite singers.Lightfoot, Croce, John Denver, Dylan, they just don't have singers and song writers like that anymore."
3,Very Basic,"I got this book for my significant other to read. It is pretty basic stuff, and is more of a pamphlet than a book. A good start, but does not cover a whole lot. Not that it is not worth getting, as it is probably one of the few publications dedication for the caregiver."
4,Great start for those in need of information,This is a wonderful booklet full of information. Don't let the size or the other reviews foil your attempt at getting this book. Ken writes extremely well and is very informed on all aspects of anxiety disorders and the journey to wellness.The book does not overwhelm with scientific mumbo jumbo nor does it under estimate the disorder iteself with little information. His book(let) is the perfect starting point for those suffering and/or those living with someone who is suffering from anxiety/ panic disorder. This booklet was highly recommended in my support group as the foundation in which to start in finding information and explanations on anxiety. An excellent read and a great source of support/information and a tremendous source of comfort for sufferers and their families. Keep up the great work Ken! Christine/Toronto
3,Basic Info,"This is the first book I've read about the topic of helping or caregiving for a loved one suffering with anxiety disorders. It was helpful on a general level and was a good starting place for me. I learned a little more about what the sufferer goes thru and how I might be unwittingly adding to their anxiety. I liked the author's writing style, which was very comfortable and much like getting information from a friend who's already been on this journey."
5,Gorey has friends,Gorey is an excellent artist of morbid tales. He ranks up there with Tim Burton. I recommend them both very much.
4,best from them yet,it's just good poptheres only four of them now butit's the best album from german Popstars reality show winnersyou got to get this cd.
4,Essential for Amis fans,"I had to have this one - an intersection of two writers I've admired for some time. Fussel is probably the ideal person to write such an appraisal. As mentioned above, the lack of critical theoryspeak is most welcome. The interpretation of Amis as a moral satirist (which isn't a category that you see very much) provides a useful key to most of his work (fiction, poetry, and prose alike.) If you're a fan of the work, you'll enjoy this - it's like having a chance to sit down across from an intelligent, perceptive reader who likes the same things you do."
3,pretty Good,"I had to hear how the Guys were gonna do some of the covers they are doing&some Hit such as Curtis Mayfield's ""People Get Ready"" but also some don't such as Prince's ""The Cross"" Which Never takes off.but they have a Good Range.I dig there take on Stevie WOnder's ""Higher Ground"".it's cool to hear Ben Harper on this Album as well.Pretty Good Set overall."
3,Hero worship.,"The other biography of Buffett is by Lowenstein and is far superior to this disorganized, fawning, but very detailed work. The flattery of Buffett gets so thick in this book it's sickening. Some of the other reviewers have done a good job of describing the other problems with the book so I won't go into detail. It does have its strengths -- exhaustive detail and excellent sources -- the guy did serious amounts of research. My suggestion: by all means read this if you are an ""intelligent investor"" (but use a library copy). If you want to buy a book on Buffett, get Lowenstein."
4,a great approach by William Bramley,"William Bramley's approach is great, but some (some, not all) of the details are a bit misleading, specially the religious part of it when it comes to the chapters (chapter 7 ""Jehovah""), (chapter 15 ""Mohammed"") and (chapter 16 ""Messiahs and Means""). I am fully supporting his approach of understanding things, and I do find it totally brave. If he only updates himself or the book on these points, I believe that it'll be perfect"
5,Great Book,One of the best books making sense of all the drama in history with the right answer to the problem..
5,This book will really open your mind,"I love this book because it opened my eyes to alot of things I was already aware of , but wasn't yet ready to face, I first saw the book the Gods of Eden at a book store in 1995 and turned it over and read the book jacket, I put the book back on the shelf, and picked it up again a year later and bought it, I was finally ready to read it, and it blew my mind, finally all the zig, zag peices of the puzzle was finally in order, I had all the peices all along but finally William Bramley gave me the tool to see the whole picture clearly, he also introduced me to Zecharia Stitchen's Earth Chronicle books, which I will forever be thankful for.I've read this book so many times I can't even count anymore. and each time I read it, I find something new to marvel at, This book is truly a gift, in many years to come I believe that people will astonished at the accuracy of what he has written"
2,Disapointing,This book failed to deliver. Speculation without the speculation! I guess his heart was in the right place.Not without its charm. Still he does a poor job trying to convince anyone about the very existence of thease aliens
1,Don't Waste Your money,Don't waste your hard earned bucks on this piece of you know what. I agree with the last review. This looks like personal opinion and sub-cultural trash. Aliens and Spacemen are all around you - be forwarned. Gimme a break.
3,light reading,"This book was an easy read from the Christian genre featuring a character from the Amish culture. The style was rather plodding and predictable with flat characterizations. Themes of family,forgiveness, and reliance on God through times of trouble.Positive light reading."
3,Small Keyboard,"Got this for my boyfriend. The keys were tiny, the headset didn't fit, obviously made for a child. The sounds don't sound like what they should. If you are looking to give this to a 5 yr old fine, otherwise its crap. It doesn't come with a cord to plug it in, and it doesn't come with batteries. Don't let UPS bring it to you either, they will sit it on the porch in the snow not even close to your door."
4,Certainly a nice toy - but not for me,I have a 61 key known brand name keyboard. I purchased this so I could easily carry it around. I see how good it can be as a toy - but I don't think it will be of any use if you are looking for a keyboard to practice on.
5,THE BEST ACTION TRILOGY EVER?,"What else is there that you can say about the Die Hard trilogy that hasn't already been said? Ok, so the second and third films are not a patch on the original but did you honestly think that they could be? Bruce Willis is John McClane, a New York cop who seems to have a knack of getting into trouble with terrorists. From Alan Rickman's smooth Hans Gruber to Jeremy Irons' weak Simon Gruber, we are treated to an action movie fans dream! and throw Samuel L Jackson into the mix for the third film and what you have is a slick, fast moving production that assaults your eyes and ears and leaves you begging for more! Check out the third films alternate and more downbeat ending-personally i think it's better than the tacked on helicopter ending that was on the original release. Buy this now and settle in for an evenings explosive entertainment!"
1,Fox Sucks The Big One,Do not buy this set. It's a shameless double dip. There is a better 6 disc set released more than 2 years ago. Plus now Fox has given Live Free Or Die Hard a PG-13 rating. Do not let them take advantage of Die Hard fans everywhere.
3,"2 good movies, and 1 horrible transfer","These are movies most everyone has seen. I'm not going to review the movies but the DVDs.The first two are pretty good. The audio has its highs and lows, but the picture quality is solid. The third one, however, should NEVER be added to any collection. Every frame is pixelated. And there's even a noticable track pause on the disc. If you really want to own these movies, wait for a better transfer."
1,Good action pack,"If you consider Die hard trilogy like movies, you would be disappointed, but if you consider it like a product so you could enjoy it. Bruce Willis is a very good actor only if you consider that he acts in the same category of Arnold and Stallone. If you like big boum-boum and machine-gunning you'll probably like the trilogy."
2,"Don't buy, this version is crappier.","This boxed set is the product of media hype. This boxed set is the crappier of the two Die Hard box set. This one only has one disc per film, where as the older silver box is a 6 disc set, 2 for each film. There is nothing better about THIS version except the packaging, and all they've done is recycle some of the features. This one is LAME. BUY THE OLD ONE! THE OLD ONE IS THE SAME PRICE, WITH MORE FEATURES!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Die Hard Series is Very Good,This box set is very good with the first two installments being excellent. The last Die Hard is just a good movie. Bruce Willis is perfect in this role and Bonnie Bedelia is terrific as his wife. Speaking of Bonnie Bedelia she is not in the last installment of these movies. There in lies a huge problem with the movie. But still this is a great ride for all. I highly recommend you purchase this package.
5,Yippee kay yay yeah mother,"Action, NY cop, guns, terrorists, machine guns, crazy situations John McClain gets into...and out of, bombs and more guns."
5,Cinematic History!,"Last summer I visited my local video rental store and decided to rent all three Die Hard films. I loved them so much that I decided to buy the collection on DVD. In my opinion, these along with the Lethal Weapon movies are the best action flics around. The Die Hard Ultimate Collection is flawless. Each DVD comes with an extra DVD filled with astonishing extras.I own tons of DVD's and the Die Hard's are the best I have. If you are a movie collector or just an action buff, then the Die Hard Ultimate Collection is a must have."
3,This movie is kind of depressing...,"I rented this movie. Thank God. I mainly rented it to see Elijah Wood's performance. I wasn't disappionted in his character. Christina Ricci creeped me out. She was like a pycho maniac. The rest of the cast was rather weak in my opinion. I came away from this movie feeling like I would never be happy again. Spend your money on better films like Deep Impact, Deep Blue Sea, Forever Young, LOTR: TFOTR, LOTR: TTT."
5,Refutation of the Sexual Revolution,"Set in 1973 upper middle-class America, the Ice Storm profiles two families that are ensconced in the Sexual Revolution, evinced by ""key parties,"" where couples bed whomever takes their key in a hat, have affairs in order to find self-fulfillment, and in general pursue the Cult of the Self, all the while ignoring their children whose neglect and neuroses fester in this movie to a climactic scene that you'll have to see in the movie. The Ice Storm is a sad film, full of cold, icy images and suggests that the Sexual Revolution was a fraud, a false storm that swept people away with its inane promises of self-fulfillment and happiness. Like so many great American films (Mulholland Dr. and Boogie Nights come to mind), the Ice Storm examines the Faustian Bargains we too often make and the perdition that must follow."
3,Not Enough Score,"As I was watching the film the music of Mychael Danna's fantastic score began to come through and talk to the audience. Danna's music was telling us what the characters were not saying, but unfortunately the CD only contains two tracks of his work. Though there are nice songs for nostalgia, the CD could have been a great deal better with more of Danna's haunting, somewhat spiritual, music."
1,a train wreck and in slow motion (so it must be art),"The screwed up story of some screwed up adults and their screwed up kids. Or what it means to be young and stupid in the suburbs. (Young and Stupid concept? See Saturday Night Fever or Urban Cowboy.)Nice to know the GHETTO does not have a Spike Lee monopoly on pain and suffering.) ANG LEE'S DIRECTION IS LIKE TAKING A CONSTIPATED DOG ON A POTTY WALK. THE DOG NEVER takes a crap. This film is a dog. This film show what ""no-talents"" Elijah Wood and Christina Ricci and Toby the Spiderman really are...they need gimmicks to eke by. Oh yeah I forgot Ang Lee=Art. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzz. Joe Biden is in this film? Right? Rename it ""Kevin Kline Pays the rent."""
1,"Like Wow, Man","It was , I don't know, like, well, you know, like, just wow. I mean we get to see real cool emotions man and kids doing it and dumb adults. And Nixon's a real bummer man. And, by the way, Nixon is a real creap Yeah. I gotta to look for more of this real heavy stuff from Ang Lee man. Wow."
1,"Wrong item, terrible company and bad service!","the company Americarx put a different picture than the actual item up for sale at Amazon, and I had a hard time reaching customer service had to call 3 times before being able to return the item and, they could care less about the business...watch out for this company!!"
4,A solid album,"This is a really solid album. I like the mixture of the different styles of music; death metal, ethnic (middle eastern), classical vocals. The song are very good, my favorite is Children of Fall. They have deep lyrics and great musicianship. Some the bass riffs are awesome."
4,o.k.,"In this book it talks about her show, friends,pets and family. After each chapter there would be a question and her answer. So I guess that It was kind of helpful but mostly a biography of her. She should have made it clear that she was going to talk ALL about herself instead of just hinting about it.( Girl Gets Real)."
2,.,"It isn't THAT terrible, as many critics and viewers have often said. The epic scope and attention to gritty and compelling detail are still here, left over from Dances With Wolves. But it doesn't rise much above that. The story is interesting but is handled clumsily, and some of the direction is painfully pretentious and silly. The performances aren't entirely lackluster (some of the secondary characters are fairly good, as in Dances With Wolves), but Costner is no more of a treat to watch than usual, still playing the same laid-back, good liberal with his typical hazy disregard of endowing the character he plays with anything other than his own aspiration to appear as a subtle, noble, romantic hero and love interest. There were a couple points where the film was really beginning to pull me in a bit, but this was almost unfailingly ruined by something silly and poorly done. On the whole, it's lukewarm at best."
2,I've seen worse,"Hey, I've seen worse movies than the Postman...As many of the reviews rightly point out, this movie is quite long. Still it did hold my interest. Also, I found it better than Brin's novel. The chracters were ones I came to care about, and the movie is beautifully filmed. Costner is a fine director and I like to believe he has another Dances with Wolves in him, though this wasn't it. The movie does have a few fine moments, especially the climactic scene between Costner and Will Patton, as an evil general. It's worth a viewing."
1,Making a sow's ear out of a silk purse!,"Trust Kevin Costner to take a great book like Brin's 'The Postman' and turn it into this - this - piece of bargain bin garbage. Forget this movie and read the book - it's far more entertaining. If Amazon let you rate at ZERO STARS, I'd have done just that."
3,life is musical,"I loved the VHS - the DVD was awful as it had sub-titles that I couldn't turn off. The story for me, was historical, as my great-grandfather was a postmaster in the 1800's, A history of what we take for granted today.Cosner's storys usually have had a historical/futuristic bent: and the significance for me. His ""Dances With Wolves"" was superb until the 'religious right"" cut the guts out of the visual explanation of the movie's title. I can't find the original movie.I've come to view Cosner as a bigot at worse, a confused person at best and I forgive him. His religious beliefs override his being as a person; a human in his own right. The fruition of his thinking can't come forward because he's stuck in ""faith.""What a loss. A great mind stuck in idealogically.I'd pick the VHS over the DVD, any day."
2,Makes no sense,"This movie made no sense to me. It seems like Costner tried to make a modern western and failed miserably. There are very few redeeming factors in this movie. I understand the concept behind it, but thought it was developed poorly. You can defenitly skip this movie and not worry too much about it."
1,3- Hour Implosion,"This film is poorly constructed and conceived. This spells doom for any movie and is much more obvious in a 3-hour ""epic"". Costner should never utter another line of Shakespeare in his life. And I never again want to see a mule and a human in a sword fight from MacBeth. The ""Hero"" of the film is a pure dweeb. He is cowardly and lacks any kind of conviction whatsoever. Events are also extremely predictable and much of the overarching story line is unexplained. And don't get me started on the cliche's thrown in. It is also unrealistic to me that communities of people will have their hope stirred by a federal beauracracy that is known for being ineffecient and slow. Jingoism hasn't been this blatantly displayed since ""Rocky IV"" and ""Independance Day""."
1,Postman delivers junk mail to junk plot,"So here you have it. 3 hours of junk. Maybe the first 30 minutes is good. But when he finds his uniform, stop the tape. Unless you want to see weak dialouge, bad acting, etc. My favorite scenes are two. When Costner's says ""Your weird"". And Will Patton finds out Cosnter is really. Shakespear. He does a terrible Shakespear show to kids. Skip this one."
2,"TERRIBLE ACTING, TERRIBLE DIRECTING, TERRIBLE.....","THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS OKAY, BUT THE ACTING WAS TERRIBLE"
4,Classic,"I remember when this movie premiered and thought it was a good movie, not deserving of all the critics negative reviews. 15 years after its release, this movie has become one of my favorites. The critics got this one wrong and goes to show how much of a chilling effect they can can have on what should have been a block buster of a movie.Yes it's nearly 3 hours long and yes it has slow moments but the acting is good and the cinematography is amazing. Maybe now that I'm close to 50 I appreciate the message of how facing the challenges of life can transform one into becoming a person greater then that which was envisioned prior to those challenges."
1,This was too weird for me,"I could not relate to this movie at all because it was very fictional and the plot was not exciting enough. I waited for the revelation that was going to make me like the movie, but it never came."
2,The Best Worst Movie of All Time,"The Postman is a movie so bad that it's good. I spent an entire weekend watching this Costnerian tour de merde, beside myself over how anything this ridiculous could get made. From Costner's opening monologue, talking to his mule, I found myself rewinding the tape, just to verify how ridiculous the script is. After a couple of hours of viewing, and only being about a half an hour into the movie, I decided to watch the whole thing through. About ten times in a row. Some of the classic lines from the movie: You over there --what did you before the war? / Uh, I had a shovel... I dug holes! How did you become the postman? / I could tell you, but I don't know whether you'd laugh or cry. The name of the post-apocalyptic postmaster? Postmaster General Ford Lincoln Mercury. Any viewer with an oddball sense of humor will find this movie more of a comedy than anything else. A classic!"
1,THIS GUY HAS COURAGE AND DETERMINATION,"THese are the greatest qualities of Costner. He takes a terrible script, a little ridiculous ""patriotic"" history, then says to everybody this is the best history of all times, takes the money needed to produced it, and then keeps thinking the movie is good, when it is only clear garbage!"
1,A waste of time...,"I rented this movie this weekend with my wife and a really good friend. By reading the description of the film my wife thought this movie must be nice, so we agreed to give it a try. What a waste of time! First there is too much unecessary violence, second the story line is just stupid and retarded. American Postmans, with guns, are restoring the goverment and saving the world from evil. What a great tale! We basically could not finish the movie... it deserves less then a star."
1,One of the Worst Movies Ever,"I felt I deserved a medal after sitting through this horrible movie. Think of every cliche you could ever think of and you could have written this movie yourself. Apparently, a nuclear war has taken place and Americans have taken to living in small communities while one man attempts to terrorize these villages with his band of renegades. But who comes along to save the day? Kevin Costner! We see Kevin bathed in firelight, we see Kevin riding horseback with the sun on his face, we see Kevin, well we just basically see too much of Kevin. He's a rebel you see...he just wants to be left alone but ultimately he has to do the right thing. Oh please! I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
1,Zero Stars,"This movie is so poor that the details are not worth going into. If you liked WaterWorld or Starship Troopers, you'll love this one.Unfortunately, this movie is based on a good sci-fi story of the same name by David Brin. I receommend the book, but cannot say this movie is worth watching on any level.For the record, most of the ""stunning vistas"" seen in the movie are matte paintings."
2,'Making a Good Thing Better' ... not!!,"One of Olivia' weakest. Judging by the lackluster selection of material, it's obvious that Farrar was saving his better efforts for the ""Grease"" soundtrack. Still, two nice inclusions with the pop-ish ""Sad Songs"" and the lovely ""If Love is Real."""
2,ONJ Never Did Make Her Career Much Better,"The only good songs are the title track, Slow Dancing, and If Love Is Real. It's too bad I have to wade through the other dross to hear the good songs."
5,love olivia,"If you would listen to the words of the songs,you just might understand Olivia.She has been through alot in her lifetime.So just sit back and listen to the messages in the songs.She is the greatest singer of all time!Making a good thing better is one of the best!ENJOY!"
1,Hooks bend too easy,the hooks weren't open enough to accommodate a normal weight on free weights or Nautilus equipment. Now they seem like the hooks will eventually break.
1,Dangerous Product,"Bottom line: Valeo makes shoddy products. I bought a pair of valeo weight lifting hooks to help with deadlifts and after three weeks one of the D-rings snapped. Luckily I wasn't seriously hurt, but I don't like to think of what might have happened if I had lost control of the weight. The moral of this story: don't cheap out on safety equipment."
2,dont bother,Tried the sun cover because yes it does get sunny in Washington. the fit is too tight and hard to get over the stroller when you have both seats on. the kids pushed and pushed until it would come off
5,The perfect Christmas CD,I love to listen to this CD over and over at Christmas time! A nice change from the traditional music.
2,"can't remember , lessons for beginners - how to play the guitar ?","I spent lots of time reviewing all your offered DVD's for guitar beginners. I thought the one I bought is the very basic one for somebody who has not seen or put a hand on a guitar . My son is an absolute beginner but he is very interested playing his new guitar . When we played the DVD , I myself could not follow the instructor . Maybe your description of the lesson is misleading . I am still looking a very starting point lesson for my son. Thank you , more power to you ........ART"
5,Timeless BEAUTIFUL Slow Jams,"This is an amazing cd, there are so many songs that youd forget about, in this cd, they bring it all back. There were so many slow songs people used to listen to that lasted only a while back in the day. Now its all renewed and played. This is the perfect cd for someone into slow soft love jams in a classy sort of way. Although I dont really suggest this cd for anyone, I would suggest to people who heard of Rome, Babyface, Knightowl, MC Magic, SWV, and are into romance classics. I love this cd, I think you would too. Mia"
4,sandy and there unique banadari and iranian rap music,"sandy has a very unique style, the singer shahram azar is a smart guy and he knows what he's doing in this industry.the song pari got many complaints but i think it is a good way of telling about the free-bees and prostitutes (jendeha) of iran"
4,"Fascinating, difficult to watch","Francie Brady is an exuberant, rambunctious gay preteen living in Cold War Ireland, with an abusive father, an insane mother, and neighbors and well-wishers with various nasty hidden motives. His one ray of hope is his boyfriend, Joe Purcell, but then Joe leaves him for another boy (a gift of goldfish becomes the emblem of betrayal), and Francie's descent into madness begins. It's an exuberant descent into madness, too, with violence that always comes as a shock, making the film fascinating but difficult to watch, more important than enjoyable."
3,worth the price,"This book arrived quickly and in very good condition. The price was great! I bought it solely because one of the four stories in the book is by one of my favorite authors - Nancy Rue. She did not disappoint. However, unfortunately, the other authors are not of the same caliber. One story was so poor, I had to force myself to finish it, with the hope that it would get better. It did not, but the book was such a bargain that it was worth the price just to have another story by Ms. Rue!"
4,Mizuno's,"I had a pair of Nike shocks while i was in iraq and i just got horrible shin splints running in them. Finally a buddy told me to try out Mizuno Men's Wave Creations. When i started running with them, it seriously felt like i was running with nothing on they're so light. My shin splints went away and running was kind of enjoyable...."
5,Big fan,"I really like this shoe, cushioning is great and it accomodates my wide foot. The one drawback is the rigid plastic frame that can clip an ankle from time to time depending on how and where you are running. All in all one of my faves."
1,It is just so..,"I was shopping for Deluxe costume for my little girl and I came across this one.I was hopping for some extraordinary costume. Well.. it is nice and simple costumebut the quality is just so so. Nothing spectacular really.I kept looking high and low and finally I found real diamond!If you are serious about a truly unique and extraordinary costume then shop some more,I highly recommend Limited Edition Snow White costume by Disney. It is hard to findit because it was released like two or so years ago but you can find it at placesas e bay. It is gorgeous. I mean that thing you could just put on the stagewith Shakespearians actors and you would just blend in. So beautiful.My daughter was the most beautiful girl ever in it. She won a costume contestthat about 900 kids participated in. She won the first prize!At her birthday she wore it too as it was Snow White themed and what a pictureswe have to remember."
3,Just ok.,"Cute costume but not well made. The size runs big, we ordered a small and my 6 yo still cannot fit into the dress enough to keep it on the shoulders, though the length is fine."
5,Simply stunning Snow White dress,"This costume is gorgeous! So well made with many details, including 2 layer skirt with sparkles. Lovely, indeed. Any little girl who loves to dress up would love this dress."
4,Cute Set,"My daughter received this set as a birthday gift and loves playing with it. I have the same problem as the other reviewer, though, in that the dolls are nude (except for molded ""underwear"")under the raincoats. Found that a little odd. The coats and boots are very easy for her to put on and take off - a definite plus for a busy mom. But I am having difficulty finding just clothing sets for these dolls (like you can for Barbie), so they don't have to be either ready for outdoors or totally naked."
3,Not what a handlebar bag should be,"What I like:Fits low - entirely below the barsStable - no bouncing or moving aroundLarge enough for the summer basics - tools, tube, patch, windbreaker, food, wallet, cellMounting could not be easier, no bracketsMinimal interference with drop bar hand positionsWhat I don't likeCovers my fork mounted light - wont fit a moderately low handlebarHard to operate zipper while ridingBecomes loose and floppy when openFront pocket zips too low, could drop thingsToo small for a pair of pants, shirt; stuff you have commutingNo special pocket or access for cell, keys, walletI used it for commuting, but it is just a tad too small. For recreational riding, it beats overstuffed jerseys hands down."
2,*yawn* And?,"Sure, it's funny. Sure, there's a juicy story or two. And? What's the point? This book serves no purpose. I think reading this book would be a lot like sitting down and chatting w/Steven himself. Smoke and mirrors would keep you from ever finding out anything of any importance. Who *is* the real Steven Cojocaru? Does anyone care? I don't anymore. Stick to magazine writing. Or don't. *sigh*"
4,Great TV for a low price!,"I bought this tv along with a sony dvd player. the picture is great, expecially with the s-video input from the dvd player. sound is very nice too. my only complaint is that it only has two a/v input jacks. i use one for the dvd player, one for the vcr, and i need another one for my playstation. no biggie though, i just hook it up through my vcr."
4,Basics for home sewers,"This book has some great basic instructions for people who make clothes at home. I think it covered the most used areas like zipper insertion, buttonholes and bias cuts. It has good visual aids. I wish that it had covered more of the fine points not just the highlights which is why I only gave it 4 stars."
5,My five year old enjoyed this book,"We enjoy the ""Let's - Read - & - Find - Out"" series of books. This one is a good addition, explaining seeds on my five year old son's level of understanding . Something that many adult writers of childrens' science books sometimes aren't very good at getting across. It is in my child's library at school.The books in this series are informative and interesting for their target audiences. The illustrations are well done and add to understanding the process being described. They make it easier to follow for kids."
5,"It's a very interesting, heart-felt, inspiring book.","This book is really working for me in easing me off my duff and into the (dream) projects I've been procrastinating about tackling. Al Secunda radiates sensitivity and understanding of people's foibles, and is not shy about sharing fascinating and amusing annecdotes about his own journey as a way of helping you with yours. A ""must read"" for most of us."
4,Nice Quality All Cotton Batting,I am not a quilting expert. My rating of 4 stars is strictly due to the fact that the batting is very thin. Maybe this is normal. What I love about this batting is that it is 100% cotton and gives the quilt an old fashion feel. It was very easy to work with and did not lose it's shape while sewing or after washing the finished item. I will buy this item again and will double the thickness for a colder weather quilt.
1,A Con-Trick on Content ???,THYROMINE HEALTH SUPPLEMENT & WEIGHT LOSS PILL FOR PEOPLE WITH UNDERACTIVE THYROIDSIt looks a good deal. The price seems about average.I urgently need to renew my supply.But there is no way I am going to purchase a product when the advertising quite deliberately avoids telling me how many tabs are in each tub !!! C'mon... do you think we are all stupid !!!!I want to know the dose/supply I am purchasing for my 'bargain' price.There may only be enough tabs for 1 week in the tub.. and then the buyer is the sucker.Amazon you should be ashamed of yourselves for letting this one through !!!.. and the company producing them needs a kick up the a..e !!..................................................................................
2,Another horrible transfer!,I am sure that many of the Ispector's fans waited impatiently for the series to be released on DVD. I made a fatal mistake of selling my VHS collection.Beware! This transfer is a disaster!Conclusion: Stick to your VHS for now!Note: same thing with Brother Cadfael DVDs. Is it the London fog or what?
4,"The first Morse I remember seeing, a good one","This is the first Morse story that I can actually remember seeing and as with all of the others it is a good story well worth watching. I would say that even a person who doesn't think they'd like an English murder mystery should try it. I would never have recognized Elizabeth Hurley in an early role as a school girl, Julia Sawalha(also present) was more appealing to me."
5,"John Thaw, simply gorgeous","First of all I was saddened to hear about the dead of one of my favorite British actors. I think the character suits him well. They picked the right man for the job, for I can't imagined anyone else playing Inspector Morse. I've enjoyed watching it on PBS. Although Mr. Thaw is no longer with us we have the privilege of watching such a talented and fine performer at work. Thank you Mr. Thaw. Now how I missed purchasing set 5 I have no idea. Definitely will do so on my next purchase/order. And yes I will RECOMMEND Inspector Morse."
4,"Provocative, dark & disturbingly funny.........","Overall, I really liked this selection of shorts and found it to be an engaging, provocative mix - and there were cowboys, randy cowboys! La Perra was hilarious and absurd; Antichrist a grueling, dark picture of war; Old Woman's Step (along w/ LP one of my favorites)I found to be quite touching in it's richness, beauty, sadness and simplicity. I didn't particularly get(or really dig)We Decided Not to Die, but other viewing friends/critics were really into it."
3,"Poetry as therapy, but better than much of that genre","Sarah Kennedy, Flow Blue (Elixir, 2002)There can be no doubt that Sarah Kennedy is a fine poet. What keeps me from wholeheartedly recommending this collection, however, is the obsession aspect; when an entire collection pounds away at the same themes over and over and over again, it can get a little oppressive. But taken in small doses, this is fabulous stuff;""He will never find me, curled hereunder the last stalks of the garden. Let's go,he yells, but I watch the bean-vinesbraiding gold corn to tomatoesand stay silent.""(""Grounded"")I suggest getting your hands on a copy of this one and going through it, at most, one or two poems a day, leavening the reading with a number of other collections; this will go down easier. ***"
3,dissappointment,I got the cds. the bonus video doesnt play as a video. It dont exist at all. are all videos and cds bootleg? is that why I couldnt play my video. all i could hear was the audio which is gr8 but I was looking foward to seeing the video as well. I was happy to see I got a video till I couldnt see it.
4,Well written,"I really enjoyed this book; the voices of the characters were diverse and authentic. I liked the themes of friendship, personal identity and issues of body image and homosexuality woven together. My biggest problem with this book was Elliot's attachment to Teresa and Larry; after he began a high school and became an admired jock I did not think it would have been realistic for him to still be so close to Teresa and Larry. Overall I thought this was a great read, the writing was great, it did deal with a lot of teen issues, maybe too much for a small book but the alternating voices and strong characterization makes this a great choice."
3,"Better than some, not as good as others","This was marginally erotic; the image quality was not that great, and the models did not appear all that enthusiastic. All in all I'd give it a three out of five stars."
2,Not based on a Colin Dexter book,"I just bought the 25th anniversary collection of the whole series and am watching them in order. I'd never seen this one before and I will most likely never watch it again. The 'Jane' character is outrageous all the way through...neither Morse or Lewis is in character...this episode is badly over-acted by the supporting cast, and the plot is convoluted. I love Morse and Lewis, but this is just awful. Please don't judge the series by this one story."
3,Morse - out on a limb,"Not one of the more popular episodes, Settling of the Sun is set in Australia. Morse and Lewis seem out of their usual depth, having to lock horns with the local police department. The story line was well written, but I thought the death of the male main character had to be murder, not suicide. Even so, it still turned out to be a tragic tale."
4,2nd Sookie Book: Fun & Steamy Paranormal Romp,"My Rating: 3.5 starsBrief Summary: The second book of the Sookie Stackhouse series, Sookie (a telepath from Bon Temps, Louisiana) is ""loaned out"" to the vampires of Dallas to discover the whereabouts of a missing vampire. Supernatural creatures abound, Sookie and Bill hit some speed bumps in their relationships, and murder and mayhem ensue. And, oh yeah, there is a murder in Bon Temps to investigate too.Brief Thoughts: Harris has a light touch and a sense of fun that make these books a hoot. Plus Harris isn't afraid to throw a bit of sex into the mix. If you're looking for steamy, funny, supernatural hijinks, this book would be a perfect pick."
4,"Have Vampire, Will Travel! Fun, fun, fun.","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Having read all of the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter books, I was sick of so much gore, detailed sex and descriptive paragraphs about various bodily fluids. I picked this book up to try and was immediately delighted. It was just what I needed.....light, fun, and yet with a mystery to solve and a romance to encourage. I love the main characters in Sookie and her vamp boyfriend Bill. they seem so normal to be so ummm shall we say unusual. Sookie is truly a girl who is open minded and non-discriminating. She is also funny, sexy, and not nearly as air-headed as her friends and neighbors of a lifetime would like to think. I would highly recommend this book, especially to those who need a relief from the heavier tales. This is just right!!"
3,Sookie Lives On,"Living Dead in Dallas is a wonderful follow to Dead Until Dark! The story began quickly and never slowed down. I am especially impressed with Harris' ability to perfectly develop each character. These characters are not only believable, but they are likable ... and lovably dislikable for that matter :) Living Dead in Dallas has a perfect amount of plot, humor, action, and insight into the characters' relationships. In this series addition, we join Sookie on a murder mystery adventure to Dallas! We get a better look at vampire-to-vampire politics as well as society-to-vampire politics. This is very convincing and engaging material!I highly recommend this series to people who perhaps are not fond of the Anita Blake Series because The Southern Vampire Series is lot lighter than the AB Series. Conversely, I think you can still enjoy this series even if you are an Anita Blake fan because the difference in tone is complementary, refreshing and entertaining."
2,This was a BIG let down!,"I was not at all amazed by the 2nd book. It took me awhile to get into the 1st book but after I did I was excited to start the 2nd. This book was a real let down! For those that really like the HBO series - don't read this book! After reading this, I no longer want to watch the series. I definetly won't be wasting my time reading anymore of this series!"
2,4 & 5 Stars for these books? What?,"I'm giving this book the same review I gave the first book in the series... I'm going to give the books time to grow on me only because the show on HBO is great and I can't wait to see what happens. People keep telling me to stick with it because the later books are better reads , and I'm going to try my best, but good gosh the books are not that great. Conversations and actions are choppy, and the story just doesn't flow right. When I'm done reading the entire series and if I change my mind I will also change my review, but as of right now this series gets a 2 Star from me."
4,Great book but waiting for the other shoe to drop.....,"This is a great mystery novel, I love Ms. Harris's style of writing and she has a great talent for creating a beautiful romance. However, after reading the Aurora Teagarden mysteries and being tramatized by Martin's tragic end, I can only wonder at how long Bill has before he's killed off as well. I had to read the end first to make sure he was still there before I would even read the book. I highly recommend the book but, I've lost some faith in Ms. Harris and it's hard to relax and enjoy the book when you keep wondering if another main character is going to die."
5,I Love These Books!,"True Blood is an addiction for me, so reading the books now are my new addiction. The differences between the show and the books give it an exciting new feel, but at the same time can imagine the characters I know. You cant go wrong with these books they are a fast and exciting read."
2,"I'd like my time (and money) back, please.","After hearing much praise being heaped on the author and this series, and being a fan of the earlier Anita Blake novels, I decided to give this book a try. Bad mistake on my part.I'm not sure what other reviewers have seen in this book, but I found it poorly written, utterly unimpressive and Charlaine's prose a little ... odd. (Perhaps a too-charitable word for dialogue like ... ""I don't have enough experience with the different characteristics of the many strains of Asians to tell you where he came from originally."" Like, wow. Strains of viruses, sure. But Asians?)"
4,Great book,"Like the first this book was great. Sookie is becoming more involved with the supe world and handling it very well. The only thing i didn't completely like about this one was that it seems a bit rushed at the end to tie up all the loose ends.(i'm on book 6 and this is the only one which seemed that way) I highly recommend the series to anyone that enjoys a good dark fantasy, it has drama, suspense, and humor."
2,Nikon recalled EN-EL1 batteries,"I have purchased three of these batteries through Amazon's various dealers in the past three years. Two out of the three are still usable. One of the older ones has failed and was very weak from the start. The two older ones would last very briefly, before re-charging was necessary. The one I purchased last year is the best one thus far, holds the juice much longer, and I paid around $15 for it.(compared to over $25 for the other two) Nikon has recalled many of these batteries, so you may want to check their website for the model #'s. The ones I bought did not have any legible serial numbers on them. (unless you can read Japanese?)Nikon EN-EL1 Rechargeable Battery for Nikon Coolpix 775, 880, 885, 995, 4300, 4500, 4800, 5000, 5400, 5700 & 8700 Digital Cameras"
4,SPARE BATTERY,BATTERY WAS RECEIVED AND WORKED SATISFACTORILY IN NIKON CAMERA.ALSO ORDERED CHARGER WHICH WORKED AS WELL.
5,I love this CD!,"This is a fabulous CD, I have had it for years, and still really enjoy it. It's nice to hear so many languages in one CD, all with a great sound and beat. The music is extremely energetic and fun. My friend loved my CD so much, and didn't know where to find it after she moved away, so I just sent it to her as a gift, and she is delighted with it."
1,Didn't learn a thing!,What a waste of money! The dvd doesn't really teach you anything at all. It's not really a system that you can put in place... it's not an instructional video. I kept waiting and waiting to get to the part where I would learn the steps 1-2-3 to employ to read the horse's body language. It never came. Maybe the book is different...
3,Not a teaching aid.,"It was beautifully done, but it is not instructive in how to get the same results for yourself and your horse.Nancy"
5,Fine Horseman Shares Insights,"The author is obviously a very fine horseman, and we are fortunate that he chose to share his insights into that tricky business of dominance and leadership. The body language he uses is different from some of the round pen teachers. More importantly, he combines ""Obey Me and Love Me"" in the same sentence. In some ways, he also teaches us to be better people. If you want to be followed, be someone worthy of being followed. Carry yourself like someone worthy of being followed.His model goes back centuries to the training system of the Knights Templar (disregarding any political considerations). Truly a remarkable horseman and a remarkable book, with many, many illustrations.As a person who works with Thoroughbreds, for whom not much is accomplished by ""making them move"" because of course that's what they WANT, this book sets forth a possibility that one can lead with dignity and kindness."
2,Beware! NO SNOOZE BUTTON!,"I just purchased this today and returned it today as well. The sound is great and the build quality is excellent. However, I was purchasing it to use primarily as a clock-radio in my bedroom and I discovered that it does NOT have a snooze button! You can only silence the alarm by turning it off. I was shocked... clearly if you've included an alarm then you must expect some people to use it to wake them up! Maybe there are plenty of people who can pop right out of bed without hitting the snooze bar at least once - but I'm not one of them! Too bad....because otherwise, I really liked the unit."
4,Sony HD Stereo,"The best quality I have ever heard from a stereo.Be careful, if you live where you can not get HD signalyou will not get the HD stations. Even with out the HDstations this stereo sounds great."
5,Great Hd Radio,I was little hesitant at first but after I hooked up the radio I like it. The sound is superb it works great in the living room Now I can pick up stations from all over the area even channels that are about 200 miles away. I like the remote so now I have like 20 preset channels on Fm. The am is good we only have one or 2 hd channels in our area but at night I can pick up chicago-etc--I would say this was well worth the cost. Only down side is we dont have many hd 2 channels yet but I like the ones we have. Hoping for more. Chris.
4,Sony HD radio,"Sony XDR-S3HD HD RadioSound quality is excellent. Would be even better if I were not in a somewhat fringe area for reception of the stations I bought this radiofor.Only complaint: there are occasional very brief surges in volume (1-2 seconds) and occasional very brief periods (also 1-2 seconds) when the sound stops. I attribute this to fringe reception, but it may be aproblem with the radio. I cannot tell."
3,Incomplete technology,"This Sony is a fine radio but it fails to include one of the most important features of HD radio technology: access to multi-casting. At least one station in Philadelphia broadcasts two programs but this radio does not have the technology to access the second program. What is the point? The seller gave me a good price & delivery service but the radio is a disappointment for this feature. Otherwise, it has good sound & the reception is excellent."
2,Snooze You Lose,"Trust me, this is a great radio and a great radio for the price. It works well in any decor and the sound quality is awesome. Actually two drawbacks of the radio, no dual alarms and it's missing the snooze on the alarm. I couldn't believe they forgot the snooze bar. What were they thinking? I'll wait till the 2009 comes out to see if they remembered to include it!"
5,"Not for everyone, but I love it!","KSR is an excellent technical writer. Some of the plot elements could use a bit of work, but if you accept that the planet itself is the star of the book (and the fight to terraform it), you will not be disappointed. Have actually read this many times..."
2,Where was Robinson's editor?,"Frankly, I was surprised by this book. Having read Robinson's other novels, ""Icehenge,"" ""Wild Shore,"" ""Gold Coast,"" and ""Memory of Whiteness,"" I expected that this, his first really long book, would have his usual touch for well-drawn, interesting characters. But the crew of explorers/terraform experts in Red Mars was a group of dull, tedious, one-dimensional, people that I wouldn't cross the street to chat with. I'm guessing that Robinson got caught up in the technical details, and lost the characterization skills of his shorter novels. Where was his editor this time, who should have pointed this out to him? I decided to give Green Mars and Blue Mars a pass. Maybe Robinson should get back to the California setting of his earlier work."
2,"DISAPPOINTING: ok plot, flat characters, lame prose","The story opens strong, but quickly deteriorates into one of those novels that you trudge through just to finish it off. The plot's ok, but I can't believe the reviews I've read here that praise the ""realistic"" characters: on the contrary, I found the characters so stereotyped and flat that I found myself rolling my eyes reading about them. And if you enjoy good prose, you'll find this book a bit of a torture to read. Take a pass on this book."
3,Too much science - where's the story?,"It took me two months to get through Red Mars. The story was BARELY interesting enough to get me to keep turning the pages. I imagine that physicists, geologists and atrologists may love this book, but for those of you who enjoy character and plot-drive fiction, this book offers only a half-hearted effort. If you thought you'd enjoy this book and didn't I recommend any of the Larry Niven/Jerry Pournelle efforts (except for Footfall). Try The Mote in God's Eye or The Legacy of Heorot for some semi-realistic science fiction storytelling with fascinating plots."
2,Actually tossed it out,"While the science discussed in ""Red Mars"" is interesting in and of itself, the author goes on and on about it instead of sprinkling it throughout the text. The result reads something more like a non-fiction description of how to get to Mars, settle there, design machinery for it, etc., but doesn't present a compelling story. A compelling story is set up in Part I (Festival Night), which is all of 23 pages, but then Part II (The Voyage Out) rears its ugly, boring head.Part II introduces various characters on their way to Mars and not one of them seems especially intelligent nor highly regarded by his or her peers. One guy, a Russian, goes around spouting philosophy and calling people names like ""idiot."" In fact, he would have fit right in with those immature misfits relighting the sun in the movie ""Sunshine."" After about 80 pages of ""going nowhere,"" I opted to pass on this version of Mars. I'll also be giving the Green and Blue versions a miss."
1,Very boring,"Probably the most boring scifi book. A lot of politics, very dull and boring descriptions about Mars ecology. Many text books are more interesting reading than this book.The plot is boring. Characters are dull, annoying, and uninteresting. There is no great character development here folks. Did I mention that the book is extremely boring. Don't waste your time with it unless you are stuck in an airport with nothing else to read, actually just go to sleep, and have some rest instead of reading this book."
4,"Red Mars is an astonishing, enlightening piece of writing...","I have just finished Red Mars, literally minutes ago. It is a superb piece of _Science_ fiction writing. The book's strongest point is the research that has gone into it. I love learning as I travel in new worlds (in any kind of fiction), and this has done a superb job of this. My one criticism (and the reason why only 4 stars) is that there are stretches where the novel _almost_ feels academic; where the science overwhelms the story & characters. STill, one of the best pieces of science fiction I have ever read. I can't wait to read the next one!"
1,Just wasn't for me.,I guess that this book was not for me. I download books if they seem interesting and get good reviews. Well at least it was free because I thought it was incredibly boring. Hopefully future readers will enjoy it more.
3,"Really, really, really Long",I like the ideas. I like the characters. But did I mention that it was really long? I think that if you really studied this book you could create an entire 3 dimensional model of mars. Mr. Robinson describes nearly every peeble and crevise on the planet as if he spent 16 years there wandering the barren wastes.The bottom line is - clip 200 pages of scenery description out and it would get 4 stars. I would have never finished this book if I was reading it in book form. I did it on tape and it took me about 3 weeks.
2,Boring and yet two dimensional,"I read the first two books of this series when they first came out. A friend's five minute summary saved me the agony of reading the final instalment. Here are the basic problems: first, Robinson appears desperate to throw in speculative detail about the geology of Mars, which may be accurate or not but has no bearing on the story (such as it is). Second, the characters are two dimensional despite getting a huff amount of development time. Finally and worst, it's just not that interesting a story.It seems to me that some reviewers mistake sheer unreadability for worthiness. Avoid."
2,Not worth the raves,"Full disclosure: I haven't read the whole thing. I read about 450 pages before I decided I couldn't take it anymore. The endless landscape descriptions were extremely tedious. The ham fisted criticisms of capitalism got old fast. I found almost all the characters extremely obnoxious, and I couldn't have cared less what happened to them. Skip this one. the mystery about Hiroko was sort of interesting, hence the extra star."
4,Savor the science,"Robinson is an excellent writer and this is an excellent trilogy, but the emphasis is on science. Those looking for light-reading action fantasy should look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you love science fiction with meat to it and you find Mars fascinating, these are the books for you.Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke...no other science fiction author has ever put so much real science into his writing, and that's only half the appeal. To get the full experience, allow yourself the time to follow the musings and personal journeys of Robinson's characters as well as the main plot. Robinson's books are better savored than read."
3,Red Mars,"Interesting story line but it tends to drag on a bit. I liked it well enought to order the next two but after the second I'm wondering if that was a smart move. Where the first seemed to move a bit slow the second sometimes feels like Mr Robinson had a bit of writers block so he just kept pecking away at the keyboard until something finally presented itself. I'm now on the third book and have had to force myself to trudge through some of it. I'll read on til the end only because, well for one I've paid for it and don't want to feel like I've wasted money, and two, I'm hoping for SOMETHING to happen. All in all the story is more or less political drama surrounded by science fiction that at times seems impractical and at others down right unrealistic."
1,Why did it get an award??,"That this novel got a Nebula Award doesn't say much for the quality of either the books in 1993 or the jury. This book was long and tedious. I kept anticipating that it would get more into the characters, who were very convoluted and confused, or into the technology and difficulties of colonizing Mars. I will not continue with the trilogy; it seems the next two are even longer and more tedious."
2,Coming from the perspective of a 6th grader...,"Well, my entire class was assigned to read this book, and I wouldn't say we hated it... but it was pretty bad. It was essentially a soap opera on Mars. Ronbinson worded it well, but it just didn't have enough content to be enjoyable... to us, anyway. I would suggest reading it if you are older than a junior in high school..."
1,Like reading a boring textbook! Hideous Read!,"I love to read fun and enjoyable science fiction books. The ones I have enjoyed most are Star Wars series and the ""Area 51"" series by Robert Doherty. The reason I mention this is to give you a perspective of the types of books I like to read.I honestly tried to get through the first 50 pages three different times. This book sounded so interesting and it was such a painful disappointment.If you like fun and enjoyable reading, don't waste your time. This is the worst book I have read in the last 5 years. I highly recommend reading the first chapter in a book store first. I am not very good at describing a writers style, but I can assure you that you will have a strong opinion after the first chapter."
3,"A little slow, but interesting","This book is obviously the first of a series, and if it is read as such, with the intent of reading the rest, it is worth the effort. The science aspect of the science fiction was fascinating to me, but as mentioned by some previous reviewers, the plot moved along slowly, and there were too many characters I didn't care about. It was worth the effort to get to Green Mars, however, so I'll recommend it for that purpose."
3,ADMIRED,"I ADMIRED this book (and series of books)a great deal, but I'm not sure how much I ENJOYED it.Typically when I fly, I can't stand the idea of running out of something to read and I usually stock up on several books and magazines.I purchased GREEN MARS (a bit of a mistake, RED MARS is first in the series) for my trip ... and I kept reading and reading and reading...Some awesome ideas... (a moving city on Mercury that always stays just ahead of the sunrise, driven by the thermal expansion of the rails it rides) but a lot of slogging through semi-stream of conciousness.The politics sounds overly familar to a Canadian ~ the Dorsa Brevia declaration reads like Meech Lake rather than the Declaration of Independence. Nice but dull."
3,loooooooong,"A very long book. It's followed by two others, ""Green Mars"" and ""Blue Mars"", which are longer and even longer, respectively. I congratulate myself for having read the entire trilogy. If you don't get strange pleasures out of reading (seemingly) hundreds of pages about rock formations or similarly unexciting stuff, you're in for a hard time.I have to say that there were lots of interesting, moving, even unforgettable stuff about politics and the love of science hidden somewhere in this book, but do we have to work so hard to extract them?Not recommended if you have a short time to live."
5,This cd is the best,"She did a hot job on this cd.All the songs on it are hot.Do not lissen to the haters saying this cd sucks cause it does not,and the they talk about who she changed her hair she has alot of haters pay them no mind.This cd is great and she is a hot r and b artist.You should really get this cd.Christina is the best."
2,genre flip floper,"Christina Millian is real indecisive about her music.she doesn't know wether to be a sexy urban R&B diva,or a safe sugar pop princess.not to put her in a label box or anything but she just seems to go where ever the trend wind blows.wether her indecisiveness is her fault or not is unknown but her latest album ""its about time"" suffers from this.kinda like brandy's never say never album of 98.rantings aside dip it low is a great song for obvious reasons.if she sticks with that formula she'll have consistant sales.because well obviously sex sells doesn't it? however that doesn't mean the songs the best in the world cause its sexual.the rest of the album is pop and R&B like i thought it would be.and Christina Millian's sexuality on this album is about as convinsing as a conservative catholic school girl trying to be a stripper.i just don't know what Christina Millian is trying to be,neither does this album"
5,The Timing Is Wonderful,"This is actully one of the best albums of 2004. Way better than her first album. Most of the songs on this album are dance songs and that is the only way to go. Here is the list of songs and their ratings. (Trust me, great CD)!Intro - 4/5 (I wish this was an actual song!)Dip It Low - 5/5I Need More - 4/5Whatever You Want - 5/5Someday One Day - 6/5 (THE BEST!!)Highway - 2/5 (Dissapointing, change songs)I'm Sorry - 4/5Get Loose - 5/5L.O.V.E - 4/5P B & J - 4/5Missing You Like Crazy - 4/5Oh Daddy - 4/5 (not what you think, its about her father walking out on her family)And if you live in EuropeI Can Be That Woman - 5/5 (disco 80's beat)"
4,DEFINITELY A VERY GOOD 'TIME' .....,"In the 3 years since her hit 'AM to PM,' the biggest thing Christina has gained is an edgier feel for her music. With IT'S ABOUT TIME, she has started to lean more towards street r&b and hip-hop. For me, the best tracks are 'DIP IT LOW' 'I NEED MORE' and my favorite 'PEANUT BUTTER & JELLY.' I particularily love the saucy groove of 'PEANUT BUTTER & JELLY' that brings Timbaland and Missy to mind. Vocally, Christina sounds excellent. Her light, never over-sung vocals suit each of the 12 tracks perfectly. Defintely a great buy if you love fun hip-hop/r&b."
2,Something went wrong...,"After listening to 'Dip It Low,' you would figure that this would be a good dance Pop/R&B; album. You would be horribly wrong. The album lacks everything, from depth and melody, to organization and reason. Though not so great, there are a few good songs that stand out.1. Dip It Low- Catchy and cool. 8/10.2. I Need More- Too many sounds going on. 3/10.3. Whateva U Want- Good, but too average. 6/10.4. Someday One Day- Better. 7/10.5. Highway- Different and sexy. 6/10.6. I'm Sorry- No melody or organization. 4/10.7. Get Loose- Slick dance track. 7/10, but plain.8. L.O.V.E.- Different with an 80`s vibe, but a little much at times. 7/10.9. Peanut Butter Jelly- Horrible. 2/10.10. Miss U Like Crazy- Just good. 6/10.11. Oh Daddy- Emotional, but good. 6/10.62/110- 56%: ** - **1/2"
4,It's definitely about time...,"It's always hard to know what you're getting when you buy a debut album from an artist, but Christina Milian's ""It's About Time"" definitely doesn't disappoint. I was actually a little suprised when I first heard it. It grows on you.Some of my favorite tracks would have to be, obviousy the first single Dip It Low, I Need More, Whatever You Want, Get Loose, Peanut Butter & Jelly, and Oh Daddy.Peanut Butter & Jelly is a GREAT song, and should be the next single (unless she decides to go for a ballad).All and all, a great album."
1,what happen to you,"yes christina flores what in gods name happen to you. what happened too your beautiful phat black hair and where are the colaborations with ja rule. i mean you looked so hot with that phat black hair but you dyed your hair yellow and it looks ugly, and the songs with your colaborations with ja rule is no longer here. so the only good song from this cd christina flores is just dip it low nothing else."
5,The debut album of the year!,"This album is a masterpiece. It's the debut by Christina Milian, who is the Cuban version of J.Lo. She's got more than a pretty face: she sings and dances so perfectly. The lyrics are well-written and the production is so detailed. You can tell that it must have taken YEARS for a record of this caliber to get made. Pop music is just getting better and better. We have Janet, Kylie, J. Lo, Britney, and now Christina. No doubt, this is one of the very best records of the year. Buy today!"
2,Mine was and still is a dud.,I bought the Milwaukee brand because of it's reputation. I'm very disapointed with the one I got. It would pull away from a guide bar on the right and bend the blade toward a guide bar on the left. Took it to an authorized Milwaukee repair shop twice and sent it back the factory once. It still won't cut straight. Will donate it to a resale store and try a different brand this time.
2,horrid heroine,"The only reason I didn't give this book 1 star was because I liked the hero so much. But the heroine... she was so insipid, and foolish! She kept going on and on about how Zack had ""heartlessly seduced an innocent girl"", and how ashamed she felt about having fallen for him. I just wanted to scream at her."
2,"Not so great, all things considered...","You have to stick it to something in order to keep it upright (it says the gel inside could leak out if you don't keep it upright), which to me is kind of a bother. But once I stuck it somewhere, I don't really smell it much. It doesn't seem to be very effective considering the size of the thing (couple inches square). Ah well."
2,Get a Garmin,"Why you ask would I say get a Garmin? When you are navigating, there is no speed shown on the screen (big thing I miss), when you come to a turn or a destination, the device will only tell you .1 mile, not XX feet as the Garmin does. Time to destination: the 760 says XX minutes, my last Garmin showed I would arrive at 10:38am or whatever time AND show minutes to destination, but the the WORST thought up blunder of this unit is you can download music MP3 files into the device and connect to your car stereo ala mini headphone jack, BUT YOU CAN'T play the music files AND navigate at the same time, it is one OR the other. That is just BAD design IMHO. I am unloading mine ASAP , and going to repurchase a Garmin, and hope that the scumbag that stole my Garmin from my truck get Ricketts, Herpes, Malaria and any other plague he/she runs into."
4,love it,"makes life and business on the road much easier and less stressful. My car does 30,000+miles/year. I figure I save 10% in gas by not getting lost, (or as lost) or finding more direct routes in unfamaliar areas."
1,Everything that glitters is GOLD!,This gps is not all that bad but it does not always take you to where you want to go the fasest way! I used it around my regular route and found that if often took me left when I it was MUCH faster to go right. It told me to go right when it ment left! Worst of all it tells me to make a right in front on my home to get on the high way - My home is the last home on a dead end street!!! It did take me to a location 200 miles away fine EXCEPT my computer mapping program took me there -using microsoft map program - in 172 miles and 30 min faster! Called Magellan to find out a few things and got the wrong infromation. This gps does tell you the names of the streets just before you get there - I was told by Magellan that it did NOT have that fuction. They were less help then the salesman at boaters world. Not worth $1200. It should be priced at about $450.
3,Could be better,This is a great unit! It has some flaws it taked too long to acquire the satelites and the hardrive takes too long to calculate route and or re-route. What I like about the unit is it says the name of the street to turn on but has problem pronouncing it. It also forgets to say north or south east or west. If you are taking I95 north It tells you Turn right on I95 but no North. All in all its OK for the price I paid.
1,Magellan RoadMate 760 poor in connecting to GPS Sats,The Magellan RoadMate 760 looks to have some fine features if you can get the unit to ever lock into your GPS position. I have gone to the extent of purchasing an external antenna for the unit and still have difficult and long waiting periods while it connects with the at least 4 GPS satellites. The wait time for the unit to get linked and working is often over 20 minutes. Once the unit syncs itself to the satellite positions the unit is fairly reliable. I would not chose this unit again. I have no idea why the product works so poorly. I have read other reviews where puchasers have never gotten the unit to actually work.
1,Magellan would have been lost...,"Bought new Roadmate 700 in 2003 at Circuit City. Worked well until I upgraded this year with Roadmate 760. Locks up, difficult to obtain satellite signal, touch features do not work, etc. Worst problem is complete lack of support from Magellan (Thales Navigation). They do not answer Emails and when you call their number you get hooked up to Rashid in India (after hours on the phone). Rashid gave me the wrong address in Texas. Mailed the unit to Ft. Hood, should have Ft. Worth. Another month wasted.If Magellan the explorer used this unit which bears his name, he would still be wandering aimlessly somewhere on the seas."
4,First Class Touring,"For my use, this machine has been quick, accurate, and a reliable companion. When I plug it in on leaving the plane after a cross-country flight, it responds quickly. There is no location it has missed from Wyoming to North Carolina. The screen is fine; the prompts are timely; the British English is soothing; the automated re-routing when interstate traffic slows and the increased sound level as speed increases are welcome. I think the mp3 player and photo viewer are silly contrivences.There is a number of contemporary features not present such as battery operation, bluetooth phone interface, radio transmitted traffic notices. Still, the excellent user interface and performance accuracy make this gadget as complete as I could ask for."
3,Not working in less than a year,I bought this product less than a year ago and it is already not picking up a sattelite. I have tried customer service and the website to me was very confusing at first and to call was even worse. It has been broke for over a month now and I am going crazy. I love the thing when it works but this short of a life span before I need to get it fixed is concerning.
4,Indispensible for Disaster Inspectors,"As an all-too-frequent HERTZ renter, I have used the Magellan NeverLost system for years. But, at now almost $9.00 per day, the opportunity to purchase a unit at a reasonable cost was a good decision. The unit is not perfect, especially on complex inner city intersecting ramps, but you learn to use it as a tool. The touch screen feature is much better than the original NeverLost rocker switch, and I find myself using more and more recall features as time goes on. If you want to get there absolutely trouble-free - rent a limo. If you want to get there with minimum irritation, this unit is great."
