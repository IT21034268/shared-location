5,Refreshingly original and frentic!,"Truly a very original and creative movie that moves at a relentless, breakneck pace. Contrary to many reviews here, the garb, customs depicted in the movie are very close to original. Great direction, photography and surprisingly good acting by unknown actors. Great movie!"
4,For USA Genealogists,"Excellent book, answers lots of questions, but didn't think when I purchased it that I really needed something to help me with overseas research. My fault."
4,"Let is snow, let it snow",A true attention getter. Wish they made it in other colors besides pink. Maybe blue as well.
3,Not bad,"My only complaint is that it runs quite hot. Don't sandwich it in between other drives and it should be fine, though.Also, it doesn't come with mounting brackets, yet the editorial says it does."
1,Useless,I have used Avery Clear Full Sheet Sticker 18665 with no problems. This product jammed my printer every time. I cannot print anything on it. It is a useless waste of money. As stated by other customers neither is really a clear sticker. This wasn't an issue for me. What use is a blank sticker that you cannot use in a printer?
1,Bad product title,"They say it's clear paper but it's more like a frosted clear paper, so when you put it on something you either have to cut right along what you printed or if you do something that you wanted on a clear sheet it looks frosted and doesn't really look good at all.Shame they say it goes on clear when it doesn't."
1,NOT CLEAR,These are not clear. Not even close. They are opaque (and even closer to white) and not advertised as such. To me they were completely useless. Buyer beware.
1,not sticky,I ordered this product because it was advertised as clear sticker sheets and they were going to be used on baby shower invitations. These sheets are anything but sticky! After 1 day of being put onto cardstock the stickers are coming off the paper! Such a disappointment and waste of money!
1,"great concept, poor workmanship","Like a previous reviewer, mine also arrived with a crack in the handle. The edges where the two sides come together are warped, so that it can't be closed completely. This causes a huge half-inch gap down the middle of all three sides, when the case is closed, allowing in dust and bugs (which defeats the whole purpose). It is a big enough gap that small ornaments might even fall out. The plastic is brittle.I have a similar case in green I purchased years ago that is great (no cracks, heavier plastic, no gaps). What a disappointment. Am trying to reach the company to see if I can return it."
3,"A great idea, less than ideal execution","The Ornament Safe is a fantastic idea -- upright, easy storage for tree ornaments and decorations, without the fuss of original boxes, bubble wrap, tissue paper, and so on. The padding on the sides is a nice feature. Unfortunately, the safe will most certainly not accomodate as many ornaments as advertised unless all of your ornaments are the same, relatively small size and shape -- and who has such uniform collections? The biggest drawback, however, is that the cheaply manufactured plastic cases do not latch shut. I purchased two cases and neither latches shut properly -- I have the handles tied together with twist-ties -- so I can only assume this defect is common to the product.I'm still glad to have consolidated the storage space needed for my ornaments, but regret that the product was not better designed."
3,Very basic address book,"This is a very basic address book, very simple in design and function. Basic black and spiral. If I had seen it in person, I would not have bought it for two reasons. The area where you write in names/address is too small. There is room for 5 entries per page, but you have to write really small to fit the info in. There are no pages for birthdays/anniversaries, not even any blank pages that you could convert to that. To me, a good address book has that included so that you can turn to one section and look at the month and see who is having a birthday or anniversary. The cost was definitely more than the product is worth."
3,Not bad but could use more pages,This is a nice phone book but I wish that it had more pages because it seems to fill up fast. The quality is good but it should be twice as thick maybe.
1,RIP OFF,Half of the book is worthless (and its less than 100 pages). Don't waste your money on this poor excuse of a book.
1,the wrong thing to buy if you're christian,"I thought I was purchasing a gospel play, not so. If the acting was not bad enough, the cursing is random and irrelevant to what's going on. I was very dissapointed. I usually give benefit of the doubt, but Garrett gets 1 star."
4,Nice book,My son really likes the book . He enjoys dinosaurs in general and this was a fun book for him to read and look at.
2,ok design - do not slide well on chair.,"I bought this to replace the nail in kind that consistently broke/fractured leaving a nail exposed on the foot of the chair.I like the design... screw then covered with a slide pad. Only issue is,, these do not slide very well at all! That is a pain! I would not have gotten these again now that I know that.If you do NOT want a sliding chair then you will love these."
5,Awesome Blade,"Not sure what to say that hasn't already been said in the other reviews. Commercial quality, great weight, will not rust, very sharp, great balance, what more can a person want in a knife."
5,One of the greats!!,"All I can say it's about time this comes on DVD. Normally to get a really good anime you must go out and buy it before it goes to the butcher shop, so they can play it on TV. It's not the case here. Like they said above if you have seen the other zoids the idea is well ruined. But in the Chaotic century You truly whitness one of the greatest animes around. The very personalities of the characters are very well devloped and let you get a real insight to the story. Plus it's not just a bunch of giant Mecha fighting for no real reason. Instead their is a real story and a good plot line. NO MORE POINTLESS FIGHTING FOR NO GOOD REASON!! I have seen many diffrent great anime but the Chaotic century is one of the greatest. I recomend this to any one who likes anime."
1,incomplete,"I LOVED this show. I watched it on cartoon network, and finally decided to buy it. So, I bought this item, and was sad to discover that although I got 6 episodes, numbered 1-6, it was NOT the actual #'s 1-6. I watched the first four episodes on the dvd, and at least 3 episodes were missing. One moment two characters are fighting, with every intention of killing, the next they are teamed up, and the next there's a new character out of nowhere who has been with them a while, with no explanation. That's two episodes skipped in between right there. I don't know whether or not there is nudity, or excessive language in the missing episodes, and that's the cause or not, but I just can't recommend this product until they release the series with every episode. Great series. Inferior product."
1,Good Title For A Wack Song,"Each time I hear this song on the radio, my hips fail to move. That's because this song is wack- it has no funky beat or bassline. My hips NEVER lie. This song will be forgotten like oatmeal at the first of the month when checks come out. Believe that!"
3,Kind of a weird movie!,"Two elderly actors, who have been friends for a very long time, are anxiously dealing with life and waiting for death. One of them has a niece whose daughter offered to come from the farmside to take care of him. He however discovers that she is a total nightmare and as a result he totally rejects her.His friend on the other hand falls in love with her. She is 50 years younger than him and he still falls in love with her and wants her so badly, sometimes in many sick ways. She couldn't accept him at first but later when she became the cause of his serious injury, she dedicated her life to him until he died.The story is kind of sick! I mean what kind of an 80 year old guy would fall in love and have these kinds of instincts towards a 20 year old girl. I believe the kind of a sick minded!At the end of the movie you just learn from it that even older men are not totally safe and are still capable of harassing young women!The movie was kind of slow and at many times boring too."
5,my favorite,"My first EZ was the Optionnated Knitter which is a very good book. This one is the best! More than patterns, you find ""the way to""... As for the 1st one, I wish it would be translated in french (and other european langages) so we could all discover the wonderful universe of EZ."
4,A classic must-have for knitting designers,"It's Elizabeth Zimmerman, so automatically it's worth owning. This book contains many favourite patterns:* Icelandic Yoke Sweater* Rorschach Sweater* EPS (Elizabeth's Percentage System)* Heart Hat or Elbow Patch* Babies' Garter-Stitch Surprise Jacket (BSJ)* Hand-to-Hand Sweater* Gaffer's Fisherman Gansey* V-Neck Fair Isle Pullover VestAs with any of her writings, this book encourages the knitter to strike out on her own, and to refuse to be bound by the limits of someone else's pattern. Her writing style is very down-home and personal, spiced with witty and clever comments throughout."
5,Go from beginner to expert in no time!,"Like all Elizabeth Zimmerman books, this one is a joy to read. But unlike some of her books, this one really teaches you the ""nuts and bolts"" of some specific projects. Some of the projects are ""out there"" like the Puzzle Pillow, but most of them are timeless and endlessly appealing, like the Pi Shawl. Very, very valuable book for nearly every knitter (and even the experts will enjoy reading it)."
5,E. Zimmerman creates a strong foundation for knitters,Great history along with many tips and observations about knitting. Good for knitters of all experiences and ages.
1,Not the best teacher's planner,"I have been disappointed by this product. I would have liked to see a ""note"" section within the pages of the week, and a bigger section to record grades. I have 5 preparations - which means 5 classes... I am now using the teacher's plan book from The Continental Press, Inc. It is simply a better teacher's planner."
4,Overall a good product,"Overall a good product, but with all the classes I teach I wish there were more squares on one page - I currently need two in order to fit all my classes into them. Love the layout and design of this product."
4,Satisfactory Purchase,Product meets all of my needs. Oregon has a good cross reference function on their web site. Competitive pricing and straight forward transaction. Solid good quality of product.
2,"good for what it's designed for, after one use.","the zipper broke after using it for the first trip we took. We tried to fix it, but now that airlines charge extra for additional bag... we just plan to buy a cheap stroller (if hotel can't provide) then donate afterwards."
1,Bad Jump Rope,"I've used these for about a month and they have completely worn out. There is no proper way to shorten the length of the jump rope. I tied off the excess, then the rope inside the handle would not rotate when I was using it. It eventually wore through the plastic covering the rope. I just threw it away this morning because it is unusable. I'm going to order some better quality ones, and I suggest you do the same."
5,Miller's finest work,"I haven't seen this work since it first came out, yet its impression has been burned into my memory. I will disagree with the other review only that individual performances CAN indeed be singled out. James Whitmore brings all of his charisma to the father's exterior. It is his performance that is the most demanding of all, yet the most sensitively underplayed. Michael Learned was astounding and electric with energy and neurosis... And very, very young, just out of diapers performances by Aidan Quinn and Joan Allen show just how much talent they had right from the start. This is a definitive production of Miller's most visceral work. Worth every penny of the (sadly) inflated price!"
4,lighter weight?,"I've been using this ball at an outdoor court for about six months so far and I really like it. The grip is pretty decent but I'm concerned about the actual ""weight"" of the ball it self. Comparing to others, this one seems to be a bit lighter than the others and its usually the left behind ball when playing. Not sure if it might be the reason, but when I left the US I had to deflate it and then inflate it again using a regular air pump. Anyway, worth the money."
5,About time this came out!!!,"This season was, dare I say it, better than the first, which doesn't happen a lot with sketch shows. This season brought many great spots, including, of course, Rick James (R.I.P.), ""A Day in the Life of Lil' Jon,"" and that hilarious Training Day parody with Wayne Brady. Truly, a classic series, and I can't wait for this to come out or for season 3 to start on Comedy Central."
5,All the hype is well deserved,"Without a doubt, Chappelle's Show Season 2 is the funniest, most entertaining DVD - or comedy, or show, or ANYTHING, for that matter - I have ever seen. I've seen certain sketches via highlights/the Internet/obnoxious people pretending to be Rick James, b***h, but every single show is hillarious! There isn't a bad sketch anywhere (though some are weaker or more offensive than others), granted, some are disturbing - for your own mental well being, avoid seeing the campaign ad for abstinenece, but everything is so consistently funny that you'll quickly forget it. Every ounce of hype is well deserved, and honestly, Season 2 outshines what was an excellent Season 1 in every conceivable facet. Avoid if you are sensitive to racially charged or sexual issues, but for everyone else, you're in for a treat! You won't be disappointed!"
4,My boyfriend loved it!!!,It came in a timely fashion it was not broken or scratched at all. It worked great and my boyfriend loved it. It was his xmas present!
4,Greatest Hits Mahaila jackson,"I found this disc quite inspiring, and very moving. I would encourage anyone who loves old time gospel to purchase this"
4,Not their best but still pretty good,"I first listened to this album in 1989 and I'm pleased they reissued it. Naturally, I can't tell the difference between the remastered edition and the original because I haven't heard the latter since 1992.Elsehow, I think ""Red Angel Dragnet"" and ""Car Jamming"" are both good enough to be on every Clash best-of album. So where they hell are they?Check this album out."
2,THE WORST CLASH ALBUM,"It really started to show that the Clash was pretty much over after this album. Even though it contains their 2 biggest songs ""Should I Stay"" and ""Casbah"" the rest is really bad. The only other good song is Atom Tan. They just sound too tired to write any good riffs and you can hear them just running out of steam. Well they had a great 5 year run and alot of great songs but this is not the one to get. This makes the throwaways on Sandinista look good."
2,Sellouts? You be the judge,"I didn't like this albums much at all, ""Rock The Casbah"" sounded tame and ""Should I stay.."" was about as weak as they come. If you like punk, stay away from this, if not, you can listen to everyone else and buy it. I personally don't really think the Clash sold out, they're a talented group of musicians and punk can be very confining. Muscially, it's good, but no energy or spunk in it which is what I like in my Albums, oh well"
2,Boilerplate publication,I am highly disappointed that Mr. Davis who has written many books of value to researchers haspublished a book consisting of boilerplate pages and lacking the important information which the title ofthe book leads us to believe will assist researchers in Alabama records. Each county section wasa fill-in-the blank format. Very disappointed in Mr. Davis and he should know better than tofoist off such a product on the public. My copy is gathering dust. A waste of paper and trees.
5,Tracing your Alabama Past,"The writer of this book is the history and genealogy professor at Wallace State College in Hanceville, AL. I have met him and enjoyed talking with him. His knowledge of researching Alabama and Georgia is an asset to Wallace State College. I have also heard one lecture of his and it was wonderful."
2,nice but breaks,l've had three of these and they all broke where the bottom clips to the top. l was extra careful with these parts too. They are very nice but don't last. Now l get the Jewel Box Window Hummingbird Feeder which is great and you can use it with or without an ant moat. Very east to clean and you can see the birds better.
2,Cheap cheap cheap,"I have bought 3 of these - 2 I had to send back because the top didn't 'click' into the bottom feeder, the plastic was warped. I was not happy with this product."
2,poor quality,"I have had 2 of these feeders, and both of them broke in the same way. The 2 plastic pieces of the base that slide and click in to the reservoir are poorly made and crack very easily. My first feeder lasted at least through the season, then broke. I just purchased a second one, and when I took it out of the box and went to fill it, and one of the plastic pieces snapped! I didn't even get to use it once.On the other hand, it is very easy to clean, you don't have to get a tiny bottle brush into the small reservoir openings that are common with humminbird feeders. The hummies seem to like it, too. If you don't care that you may have to (very) frequently replace it, it may be a good purchase."
2,poor shipping package,"The product came in a loose envelope. The paper box of the item is not sturdy enough to protect the plastic material of this product. A small piece of plastic has been broken. Even though the item is still functional, I am very unhappy with the vendor who did not ship the product in a sturdy box. The sucking cup is pretty strong, after several weeks, it still hanging strong on the window."
1,Window Mount Feeder by Perky Pet,"I dropped my Perky Pet window mount feeder and one of the little plastic clips broke off the back, rendering it unusable. Perky Pet told me they would sell me a new part for $6 and charge me $10 to ship it to me. I said no thanks. Then I looked for alternatives; and found a much better product for a lower cost. If you want an excellent window feeder, take a look at the Opus 455 GardenJewels 14-Ounce Glass Window Mounted Hummingbird which is $9.99 at this writing, glass and ten times sturdier than this Perky Pet Piece of Junk. I've owned both; and I won't own anymore Perky Pet feeders.Opus 455 GardenJewels 14-Ounce Glass Window Mounted Hummingbird FeederPlus, it's eligible for Free Super Saver Shipping. Be smart; buy something that lasts."
4,"It IS too fragile, but....","After the two prongs on my second one broke at the same place, I figured out how to use them anyway. Most windows have a ledge below them outside; if you place the suction cup at the right height from that protrusion, the feeder rests on that ledge, and it works perfectly. Using it in that position also lessens the downward pressure which might cause the suction to fail, and the whole feeder hitting the deck. So I go right ahead and use both of them, broken or not.Still, since the design has this obvious flaw, I do think they are perhaps priced a tad too high."
4,A good computer but a little noisy,"I bought this computer this summer to take to NCSU in the fall. So far it has been just right for my uses, provides convenience when going from wireless to cable internet, processes things very quickly, and so on. The only problem is that it gets a little bit warm and the fan is noisy at times. Its also a little heavy to carry around and the battery life is poor. If you don't intend to take it anywhere for use without a power connection, then this might be the computer for you. Another bad thing about it is when you are typing, the touch pad often selects another part of the page and your type will continue on somewhere else. i would definitely recommend getting a small mouse to go along with this computer."
4,Productive and well written,"Picking a winner from a race where nobody has won before is inherently difficult, and picking winners from entries that have never raced before can be even more difficult. Illman effectively presents material on how to approach these tasks by presenting examples of numerous angles and factors and how statistically significant they have been. I believe that by using some of the ideas here, a handicapper can generate an edge on the masses."
2,"Juergen is fantastic, but the film is not.","I thought this movie was supposed to have a german language track, but it doesn't. I like Juergen Prochnow quite a bit so I can sit through this film, but I don't think anyone else will be able to."
3,Fast and Furious it ain.t,"Fast and Furious it ain.t, and they have nothing too worry about.For a cheesey 1970's movie it's OK. AND HAVING TO WRITE 20 F..N WORDS ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS WAY TOOOOOO LONG"
3,Flashback by Nevada Barr,I enjoyed Flashback except for the skipping back and forth between eras. It could have easily been 2 books. I do like her books though.
4,reminder of key west,bought the book because four of us vacationed in Key West & visited Dry Tortugas the site of this mystery. Ranger there said the book was historical and gave great detail of the island and its use at the end of the Civil war. After reading this book I may purchase one of her other mysteries.
3,A favorite author wanders off the track...,"Other reviewers have also mentioned two things that flaw this book for me. First, the device of cutting back and forth between two different plots, present and past, has been used so much lately it's already tired. In this book, rather than introducing suspense, it was just irritating. Every chapter a cliffhanger, wow. Second, the chapters that are supposed to be letters from Raffia are too literary, long and detailed for letters. More like Raffia was trying her hand at writing a bodice-ripper melodrama in her spare time."
1,Disappointing,"As a seasoned human resources professional, I was looking forward to reading this book. This author takes an extremely negative approach and bashes human resource professionals in the process. This author clearly sees the glass as ""half empty."" Very disappointing."
4,A watershed moment,"This is Third World's most significant transitional album. A wonderful example of how 2nd generation ""Soul"" music could relate and expand on what was happening in the reggae world mere months after the death of Bob Marley. While not as tight and passionate as Steel Pulse's ""Earth Crisis,"" this is a wonderful album that speaks directly to the state of roots reggae at the time."
2,A bit too tidy...,"I, too, am a former employee of this monolithic bank, and I picked up a copy of this book to see what parallels there may be with my own experiences there. While he describes the general atmosphere and political posturing very well, the read is often bogged down with unbelievable dialogue and an ending that's way too tidy. It all comes together a little too neatly in the end, and well outside of any reality-based premise, given the individuals involved.What's even more laughable is that the author thinks that a 6-month severance is some kind of godsend... when in reality, many people in middle management were getting much longer severance packages at the bank in question.I give the author credit, however, for sitting down and writing this novel and self publishing it."
2,Weird organization and disjointed exercises,"Maybe I missed something, but a few pages into the book, the ""hands on"" exercise was refering to a page I had not created. Then the book continues to refer to this page, and others. This makes the book not completely hands on, in my mind. This is not what I was expecting based on other Sams books. Also, the organization of the book in a bit odd. Each page is quartered which may look graphically interesting, but seemed to make it harder to follow. Additionally, in a couple of minor places, the book did not deal with differences in the Mac version of Dreamweaver very well. If this were my only choice, I would buy it, and make use of it. It's not, so I'm going to return it and go with something else."
1,I was forced to read this.....,"As a part of my AP lit course i plan to take this year, it was required that we read this in order to take the class and guarantee our seat frot hat year. Well, I wasted two days reading this book and I can appreciate that it may be some masterpiece.....but to who? Certainly not to me. I found the book boring and the main character's life was so unrealistic..i wanted 2 puke..its ok to make it exciting..but come on.... too much is too much"
2,"Pretty pictures, flavorless cookies...","I was VERY excited to buy this book, because I adore cookies of course. After trying a few of the recipes though, I have to say that this book is very disappointing. The recipes are just not that good. The cookies were very bland and not even remotely exceptional. I guess these people either didn't test these recipes out, or just have unbelievably low standards. When you write a cookbook, you should try to create the best possible recipe for each dish. They must not have cared too deeply. Another reviewer wrote quantity not quality. I agree!!! ..."
2,Nice source of inspiration but...,"Were any of these recipes tested? I'm a fairly experienced cooky baker - and bought this because of the many new ideas presented in it. Having tried making several types of the pumpkin cookies, and after reading the other reviews, I've come to the conclusion that none of these recipes were tested. How can you make cookies with no sugar? All of the recipes I've tried have turned out like unflavored rocks.I gave this collection 2 stars since it does allow one to glean ideas from the recipes - as long as you have the talent (or other decent cookbook) - to modify the ingredients."
2,The Cookie Crumbles,"This is a good book as a reference for what a particular type of cookie is. It would be good for baking for International Day at your kids' school since kids will eat almost anything sweet. The cookies I have made have been edible but unexciting. I got it because the recipes call for shortening (my daughter is allergic to dairy products). However, I have had much better luck using other cookbooks and substituting margarine for butter. What do you need this many recipes for if you don't want to eat them?"
2,Flavorless cookies,"I have tried 26 cookies from this book. I have two that were good, the rest were flavorless. A large number must have had mistakes in the recipes as I ended up with dry, crumbly, dough (and I use that term loosely). I came back to this spot today to buy another cookie cookbook as I have finally given up on this one."
5,Thumbs up!,"It is a page turner. Good plot, attractive characters, good description of events and places. The medical aspect is very interesting and believable for a lay person. I am looking forward to reading more books from this author."
3,"Light Chain, Dulls Easily","Bought this to replace my McCullogh Electric 14 inch saw chain, which I had used for years. Noticed upon receipt and before installation that it was a much lighter and flimsier chain. Upon first use, it cut well, but dulled quickly, and I wonder how durable it is, and how many sharpenings it could take. But it is cheap, and the OEM McCullogh chains are no longer avaiable, at least not for a decent price--if you call McCullogh, third party answers--the company went bankrupt and excess parts are being sold by 3rd party--they want $50 for the chain. So this Oregon is more affordable--even though not as long lasting. Should prepare to replace often."
2,just don't take the chance if you care about the condition of your disks,"a lot of classic pee-wee for the money, everyone should have this, but be forewarned : you will more than likely have ATLEAST one defective disk. this happens nearly EVERY time i buy stuff online, unfortunately you can only return the full set, so if you do, you'll just get more defective disks. if you care about the condition of your disks, well, you are basically out of luck like myself because no other place will have this set (let alone for the price). i'm totally bummed out on christmas because this was definitely the ultimate gift for me."
5,parrots cold,"no light and much heatkeeps the parrots warm, they love it, sit by it all nightdidn't use anything before but they sure like the heat given off by this"
3,Great for the price,"I got this for the snake and it works great. I went to petsmart where they sale the store brand for 37.99, I was looking for Zoo med not the petsmart brand which i have used in the past. I was over joyed when I saw that Amazon had it for 17.99 and that it was Zoo Med. Overall I am pleased and will buy all my turtle and snake items through Amazon."
3,Save some money. Go buy their 40 pages of the other paper.,"Look, you could just buy the 8.5x 8.5 origami paper and put your own, realistic, markings on it. It comes in solid colors and one gold paper, [...]. You get 40 sheets that way. Kids love to decorate their own paper. And it is bigger than this stuff. Who ever saw an animal that was yellow and green? I guess a grasshopper or something, but you could make your own, and it would be cheaper and more fun."
2,Not Impressed,I did not feel any tingling or change in my face. I am going back to my doctor to get the real thing.
5,Lover of G-ds' People and Promise,"I recently read this book. I was touched and blessed at how G-d decided to use this womans life to move many to the Saving Knowledge of Jesus; the Jewish Messiah who offers salvation to the Gentile people, as well. Blessing is due to all who read Ruth and Mike Perl's Testimony of Trust and Reliance in Christ alone to provide for every need and more! Baruk Hashem Adoni. I don't think I spelled that correctly! Bless the L-rd your G-d."
1,No humming please,I can't believe a professional CD with the pianist HUMMING along with his playing. this is most distracting. I wasted my money.
5,"Beauty, simplicity and perfection","It's not easy to write a review about an extraordinary genius who interpreted music also written by a genius, and all the superlatives about this particular performer have already been written, expressed and exhausted. Still, every time I revisit this recording, I am overwhelmed and profoundly moved to the core. The words are pale and weak to express admiration or pay a tribute of praise to this incredible pianist, this remarkable ""musician's musician"" who left us so early. The articulation is beguilingly marvelous, and the heartbreakingly beautiful phrasing bewitches and mesmerizes. Variation 25 so enthralls me that I would want it to be the last thing I ever heard in my life. I recommend this recording to anyone who cherishes beauty, simplicity and perfection."
1,Too much humming,"I realize that negative reviews are almost always branded ""unhelpful,"" but here goes. The humming by Mr Gould on this recording makes it unlistenable. Especially when heard on headphones, the groans are maddening. I am not interested in hearing moans; I would like to hear Bach. Whatever Gould's attributes (many, I'm sure, as demonstrated for example on the recent Great Performances series on piano artists), they do not make up for this defect."
5,THIS is the recording to get,"I know that the experts much prefer Gould's 1955 recording of the Goldberg Variations or even the Perahia. But I SO prefer this more mature, more varied, nuanced version. And the reprise of the Aria (Variation 32) is the music I'd want playing as I was dying."
4,"Wide ranging, spirited and evocative music.","I loved the movie, and I think the soundtrack contributes a lot to the movie. The music is daring. It covers a lot of emotional ground and moves easily from calm, introspective, romantic moments to moments of grandeur, fear and real power.I've been listening to this soundtrack more than anything else for the past few months. I like every track on it.I was previously a fan of Enya, and her contributions are wonderful.It's hard to sum up what sort of music is on this soundtrack simply because it has such a wide variety of mood, although it is all classical/choral. Therefore, it is, unfortunately, hard to tell what sort of person might like it, or something like ""if you liked such-and-such, you'll like this."" I am not personally familiar with any other soundtrack, or any album for that matter, like it. All I can say is that I really enjoy every minute of it."
5,brilliant and perfectly arranged,"often uplifting and powerful, this soundtrack and the others will knock you over at how brilliant they are. my favorite part is the hobbit music, it is just so beautiful and happy and perfect. I never get tired of this cd or any of the others, and make it a point to alternate through these paramount orchestra triumphs that we call the LOTR soundtracks. Don't even think of the music in terms of the movie (though it is hard to separate the two, the music is just such a huge part of the movies) enjoy it for its own sake if you can. It is beautiful and perfect, and should be considered a classic!!"
3,Copy-protection,"Excellent music, superb score. Enya does this soundtrack proud.... Just don't plan to play it on your computer.Having ordered this CD, I recieved the 'enhanced' version, which is basically the soundtrack with the ISO filesystem hiding the music. A web page and shockwave file were all that could be found when I attempted to listen to this CD on my computer, and despite my best efforts, I could not appreciate this soundtrack on the far superior sound system attached to my computer."
4,The music is good but the movie is better,"I really enjoyed the 3 series of The Lord of the Rings movie so I wanted the music. The soundtracks are good but if you like the movie the soundtracks watch the movie. They remind you of certain parts in the movie like the song Concerning Hobbits. The song is whimsical. Enyna has a great voice, very haunting. The Ring Goes South is another favorite of mine. I can enjoy these soundtracks as classical or dramatic music. I bought them because I loved the Lord of the Rings which has many similarities to Braveheart. Bravery, courage, strength, honesty, selflessness, love and other good human qualities people try to attain and admire them in the people and movies they view."
5,"5 for the music, 2 for the content","As my only real exposure to Howard Shore's film work was the low-key grimness of his ""Silence of the Lambs"" score, I was unprepared for the scope and reach of LOTR. I love John Williams, but in someone else's hands this could easily have become a bombastic, ersatz-Williams exercise. What Shore does instead is so subtly effective you may not notice it on a conscious level when you see the film. Without doubt the finest orchestral score by an American movie composer in 2001. My only complaint, and it's a doozy, is the CD is much, much too brief. Shore composed nearly three hours of score for this film; Warners gives us less than 90 minutes. Will this be another ""Phantom Menace,"" a ploy to get fans to plunk down ...after which the company will go ahead and release a 2-disc set? Few movie scores deserve a second disc; this is absolutely one of them."
5,best score ever,"This soundtrack is probably my most favorite soundtrack I've ever heard. I'm always in the mood for it, because of the variety of different styles that are used. Whether I'm happy, sad, angry, energized, there's always something there I can listen to. Before I bought the CD, I watched the movie so many times half the time just to listen to the music. I've seen the movie 30 + times for certain, and I've listened to the CD too many times to count :-) I can't wait until the soundtrack for the Two Towers comes out, it sounds really good on the previews for the movie. If anyone knows when it's out, let me know at: (...) thanks!"
1,Tripe,"Silly, insipid score that has nothing to offer musically. He overuses the chorus in reckless abandon and poor taste.I hope the movie is far better than this tripe."
4,THE BEST!!:),I love this cd. Tracks numbers 2 and 17 are my favorite. i would recomend this cd to anyone who liked the movie and who likes semi-classical music. I can't put this cd down! And neither will you if you buy it.
5,The best soundtrack score yet,"I got this cd on my birthday, which was before ever actually seeing the movie, and never having read the books, I was still happy to receive it. It has excelent music! Some fun songs like ""Concerning Hobbits"" and the beginning of the song ""Dark rider"" is light hearted (not for long though). It has great action music that makes you want to know what's happening just by listening. Also some sad songs, like enya's theme for Aragorn and Arwin, and May it be, the song playing during the credits is one of Enya's most beautiful. This is a fabulous cd to add to anu collection! And besides that, each cd has a card of a different charactor (Arwin, Frodo, Bilbo, Gandolf, Aragorn, ect.) I personally have frodo sporting a smashing new sword. Underneath the card is the reall cover. So what I want you to do now, is scroll up to the top of the screen and click the add to cart button. There is no chance you won't like this cd, unless you have serious mental problems."
2,latest Suzanne Vega C.D.2007,"I love Suzanne Vega, shes one of the best neo folkies to me.I have all of her music,in fact her 1st one on l.p.record! Her c.d.from a couple of years ago ""songs of red and grey"" is one of the best c.d.s of anybodys.Unfortunatly the new one isnt even close,I mean it has its moments, but after waiting 3 years, its not that good.Iam a bit dissapointed this time, it just doesnt touch me as her other ones have.I think its partly the new producer on this one,its harder edged than usual,I still love her, next one will be more to my liking ,eh?"
3,"Good, but Brief","I have been a fan of Suzanne since we lost to her in a ""Battle of the Bands"" in Greenwich Village in NYC. Although this is strong, it lacks some of the passion of ""99.5 Farenheit Degrees"", and is very short, clocking in at less than 40 minutes. Still a favorite."
5,Just what we needed,"The long wait is finally over, and it's just as it should be. Her albums are always similar enough to be familiar, but different enough that each has its own personality and offers something unique. This installment is no different and has a secure home in her pantheon of classics."
3,Architectural Graphic Standards 1932 Edition,The book is fine. ()It only contains standards from 1932.This book is not very usefull to anyone building to current standards.
5,My Son LOVES These!,And they are good for you. Even Mum likse to eat them ;) Pity they are now discontinued by Amazon!
4,its a racket,Decent racket for the price. Not much to say it plays well in in the middle for weight and fuction and looks are above average. Fits its intended use.
5,GREAT FUN!!,I bought this puzzle for my partner and she absolutely loved it!! She put it together completely and immediately took it apart so she could put it together again!
2,"Just Because They're Old, Doesn't Make Them Insightful",The book is a bunch of snippets from older people. I did not find most of the snippets to be particularly profound or insightful. It is a short read (1 or 2 hours max) so it may be worth it to some people but not for me.
4,MONROE from JohnBoy & Billy radio,"Just my kind of quirky book. Probably because I remember him calling in his reports on the JohnBoy and Billy radio show. I thought it was funny, but learned it was much more."
4,A comfortable experience,"The interpretation for Fleisher in beethoven piano concerto No.4 is focus on left hand. It's kind of interesting, but if compared with Gilels, I think Gilels played better than Fleisher. The balance of Gilels is incomparable. But Fleisher plays much more lyrical in some aspect, making me think of Perahia.It's the first Mozart No.25 I have, so I may not provide authentic review here. It sounds good to me. But sometimes I would wondering why some reviewers think it's the best No.25 CD in the world. Just curious. For me,the experience of hearing a fantastic Mozart piano concerto playing is Annie Fischer's No.21 in EMI."
2,Color too bright,"The color is too bright. It doesn't have a sheen or anything, it's just too intense for my liking. But there aren't a lot of choices for organic lipsticks. I will probably buy again in a different color."
1,EMILY is just too weird,"Was looking forward to this because we liked ANNE OF GREEN GABELS, ROAD TO AVONLEA and other Montgomery-TV-productions. But the others are by director Sullivan. Not this one! And it shows!The girl plays well. But the story stinks; dead people walking around in every episode who Emily emagines, I suppose. This storyline has nothing to do with the books or with the feel which all the Sullivan films have. The price is good; but don't waiste your money on it if you don't like weird things."
3,Decent stocking stuffer,I was looking for some small items for stocking stuffers and since I bought my daughter teh Barbie Diary movie I thought this would be a cute accessory. I haven't really sat down and played with it too much myself but it looks cute.
1,Loaded with Errors!,"As stated in the previous reviews, this book is loaded with errors. The CD-ROM isn't exempt from these either. I found 2 significant errors in their online exams within the first hour of using them; one a math problem, the other a sentence correction problem. No subject is safe! So far, I've found 6 errors between the book and the CD, and I bought it less then 24 hours ago. Stay away from this set!"
2,Missing crucial Tivo features,"Unfortunately, this unit does not serve the purpose for which I purchased it. Unlike a Tivo, you can not play a recording back until the entire recording is finished. In fact, you can't do anything while recording a radio program except listen to what is being recorded. You can't pause live radio. In fact, I can't find any way to stop a recording once it is started.Reviewing the other reviews, I ran across another missing feature which I haven't yet experienced myself: it does not ""expire"" older recordings to make way for new ones. Instead, it simply refuses to record the new program.The reception seems OK for stronger stations, but it would be nice if there was a model with some kind of super-quality tuner, if such a thing is possible in such a small package."
1,Outrageous,"I bought this doll for my six year old daughter. When I opened the package, I discovered that the doll does not have on regular underwear. It has on a thong, that is made onto the skirt. I think that this is outrageous to put on a childrens toy. I was greatly disappointed. I wanted to return the doll to the store, but my daughter really liked the doll, so instead I went in search of additional clothing that included decent underwear."
2,Shades of Left Behind? Not even close!,"The book itself is very slow paced, too wordy about unimportant matters and really has little to do with the aftermath of the Rapture. The story is passable, and the author obviously quite knowledgeable in the areas of political jargon, corruption, and comportment, but if you're looking for something comparable to The Left Behind Series, give this one a wide miss. True, it started with the Rapture, but it's all downhill from there, just another droning tale of murder, mayhem, backstabbing, and the political maneuvering and menace that is our government today...as I said, politics as usual. I also find it rather irritating that Ms. Hart and/or Tynsdale Publishing have been allowed to trade on the success of the Left Behind name to sell these books that in no way compare to Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye's wildly popular series."
5,end of state left behind,the book arrived in good shape and a timely manner. have enjoyed reading the series they are an easy read along with follow up books of other areas of impact.
2,"Great idea, poorly executed","This book fails both as science fiction and as military strategy. It reminds me of the worst academic military strategy books, full of charts and manufactured statistics, unleavened by practical military experience. The few valuable insights could have fit on one page."
3,Sadly a little dated.,"I have the original vinyl record,and i was expectinggreat sounds from the new c.d.,alas the storm sectionwas quite disapointing,as the vinyl record had thewind roaring enough to give the listener goose bumps,and this is lacking on the c.d.At least this recording still has the magic of yesteryear.john."
5,Great music-great price,"Two major pieces by Ferde Grofe in one great CD: and conducted by two great conductors as well. The Mississippi Suite is not heard as much as the Grand Canyon Suite, but it has much to recommend it!"
5,Kudos from another former student,"A very good book. Dr. Robbins does indeed write as wellas he speaks. This book would make a useful addition to your""self-improvement"" library. I highly recommend it."
5,Great and Concise,This book is very concise. It was used in my critical think class for college. I found it such a great resource that I had to add it to my book collection. It offers great explanations and plenty of drills for self-evaluation.
3,sharpener,Stones are ok but could last a little longer I purchased the sharpener and sharpened about four chains and the stone was done
2,Not a good transfer to DVD,"I'm not rating this movie based on the acting. I knew going into it that this wasn't going to be a piece of 'high-art' film-making.I am giving this movie a 2-star rating , however, because the transfer is very poor quality. The producers of the DVD made no attempts to clean up the film and it is riddled with scratches from the original filmstock. Also, the sound quality is extremely bad. I have to practically turn the volume all the way up just to hear what the actors are saying, but then I also get a lot of 'hiss' from the speakers for doing that.As a 70's era Blaxploitation movie it's adequate. Not one of the best examples certainly, but I've seen worse.It's probably not going to get a better release than this, so if you're into these types of movies just be advised that this DVD transfer is very inferior quality."
3,The fighting is funny.,"Worst martial arts I've ever seen in my life, if you are a fighter , you'd definitely laugh with tears. I gave it 3 stars to support the black film. The fighting is hilarious , should have been a comedy."
3,It's cheap and fun,"It looks and sounds like a fifth generation dub of a vhs tape, but it's still fun to watch. Nobody here can act and they apparently improvised the fights on the spot. You betcha, this is MST3K type fun. It's worth it for the Casper the Ghost cartoon alone. When's the last time you saw a full-length cartoon before a movie? DO IT...."
4,Great Product,"This is a Good product,it was easy to install took about 15 min. Looks greatin my kitchen! Very sturdy, just find the wall studs to make sure it bolted to the wall if your hanging heavy objects."
2,"Funny, but no action","The pictures in the directions were very unclear because the details were lost in Jim's black coloring. When (FINALLY!) completed, the chest-thumping action was feeble at best. Not worth the effort. The other paper animation kits have been a hoot, so I'm sorry to have to rate this one so poorly. In general, the paper animation kits in this series are truly remarkable and great fun for anyone over the age of about ten."
4,Great Live Document,"These are some great performances by Monk and his Columbia quartet, reproduced in very high quality. Everyone seems to be playing well, and there's a great loose feel to many of the tracks (see the ""Misterioso"" intro, which starts a little off balance before magically sliding into a killer groove). One might gripe about the repetition among to two sets, but that can't outweigh the quality of the music."
1,Waste of money,"The only things you'll get out of this book that you may not find easily on the internet are the pictures.Also, I was disappointed that the author was not a Cornellian.You can finish this book in one sitting and not because it's well written or particularly interesting. If you extract just the words from this book it will not fill a pamphlet."
3,Dietary Supplement partial results.,This product has had a beneficial reaction on the state of my nails but I have seen no positive effect on the thinning state of my hair.
3,No hair growth :(,Before moving onto prenatal vitamins (which I have also given up on) I tried these for my hair...I was hoping for thickness. I haven't noticed any difference after using a whole bottle :( Sadness. I'm sticking to regular vitamins and healthy food from now on.
1,Not worth it,"I took these vitamins for about 4-6 months and didn't see any noticeable improvement in my hair or nails. I do think my nails grew a little faster, but whenever I'm keeping up with my multivitamins they seem to grow too. No change in my hair (which was what I bought them for), it grows pretty slow to begin with and it didn't grow any thicker or longer using these. I'm sure they didn't do any harm, but definitely not worth the price."
5,It can't hurt.,"If you have fine and thin hair, this is a supplement that contains Biotin and various other things in it that are all natural and can't possibly do any harm to your body. I don't like taking pills of any kind (even Doctor ordered), but I take two of these pills every day and they seem to help make my hair look fuller, according to my hair stylist, and my nails a little stronger. I am very pleased with this product and will continue to take it ."
5,Easy to Read and Insightfu;,This book is easy to read and it made me thing about a lot of things we take for granted. It also made me realize I have a lot to be greatful for.
5,THE BEST!!,This was one of the most inspiring books I have ever read. It was funny and profound. I highly HIGHLY recommend it.
2,Great information for pit lizards,"""The Girls Guide to NASCAR"" would have been a great book if segments such as the ""girlfriends"" tidbits were ommitted; some female race fans are older than 16. The question that refers to ""the possiblity of a driver taking notice"" assumes that every female is in the hunt for a man when she is inside the garage area. I truly hope this is not the case. I have read another guide of this type which was just as informative without the high-school, teenie bopper focus. Not every girl is a Kasey Kahne fan just waiting for him to notice........My wife bought this book hoping for an insider's view, which she got. But it wasn't the kind of inside information she was looking for."
2,Not worth the money,I purchased this for my daughter on her fourth birthday and the only thing she liked about was throwing the balls around. I would say this game is more for 1 to 2 yr olds. This game got put away in the closet as soon as the birthday party was over.
4,Excellent scope.,"Great scope, strange sticky grease used on focuser which is exposed. Requires a diagonal, as there is not enough focus travel to use an eyepieces straight through. For those who do not own an additional diagonal, eyepiece, telescope rings, etc., strongly consider buying the whole package as you get all these items, plus a tripod and eyepieces for an additional $180ish.Although the scope does suffer from chromatic aberration, as expected, it displays wide field views exceptionally well. Used in conjunction with my C11, I found the views of Jupiter to be quite similar under the same magnification, albeit with a bit of purple fringing. In short, compared to my C11, I thought this to be a great first (or last) scope."
2,Not that good.,"Blood Debt is just another one of Wolverine's adventure in Japan but this time he also goes to Mongolia. There really nothing special about it. Wolverine is doing his thing, avoiding trouble but then some bad guys decide to get into a fight with him, thinkinhg that they could actually take him. Overall, Blood Debt follows the basic Wolverine story, he kills some villians and save the day....with attitude."
3,Sub-title sparse,"I thought for a while there was a problem with the DVD (a rental), as the sub-titles seemed to have vanished. But, no, they continued to appear, but in incomplete sentences and thoughts and with significant untranslated dialog in between. Yes, speech is often characterized by incomplete sentences, but it was obvious from the time between subtitles that much was being said that was not being captured. The gist of what was transpiring seemed apparent, but why have to settle for the gist, and assume that, in fact, your take on it is correct? The acting appeared to be first-rate. I wish I'd been privy to more of the the details of the story."
4,THE CLASS dvd !!!,"Very good synopsis, modern & up to date descriptionof what goes on in many schools.I enjoyed it, and recommend it espediallyto teachers & school directors !!"
2,DOES NOT WORK WITH INTEL BASED MACS!!!!,"DONT BUY IF YOU HAVE THE NEW IMACS, OR MACBOOKS. THEY REALLY F**K YOU IN THAT. AND THEY DONT TELL YOU THAT IT DOES NOT WORK. YOU HAVE TO LOOK FOREVER ON THEIR (MICROSOFT'S) WEBSITE. AND APPLE DOES NOT TELL YOU.OFFICE IS THE ONL THING THAT WORKS, SO JUST BUY THAT IF YOU HAVE AN INTEL BASED MAC."
2,VPC fo Mac/XP Pro,"This software is a disappointment (and I never bother to review anything.)If you are a Quicken Premiere user and hope to do everything on your Mac, forget it. I use a PowerMacG4, twin 1 ghz processors and 2GB of memory and that is not enough because Microsoft fails to use the capability of the hardware. Screen refreshes are excrusiatingly SLOW. If you are in 'scheduled payments' and wish to pay , let's say, 6 bills, you may as well take out your pen, stamps and checkbook. It will be faster to do it by hand. This was the highest priority reason for trying the product and it failed miserably. Save your money and don't throw out you Windows computer! It does run Internet Explore 6 acceptably."
4,for the birds,I needed a second feeder. The original feeder has a broken perch and I know to be very careful not to break the flimsy plastic perch on the new feeder
2,"No instructions, and the PDF isn't helpful","I just bought several feeders, ant guards and nectar which are made by this company.My purchase was through Amazon, so I have searched comments for help in here.The 203 CP is missing one bee guard,, as well as 2 yellow flowers for the model 209.There are no instructions for attachment. Do I use string, wire or monofilament? Was some cord supposed to be included? What is the purpose of the red plastic rod in the jars?I am disappointed, because it's impossible to put these out unless and until the company replaces the missing parts and answers questions about hanging....."
5,Great hummingbird feeder,"I just ordered an additional three of these hummingbird feeders. In the past I had used several other hummingbird feeders -- until I discovered this one. The GLASS bottle holds a lot, is easily cleaned, & is practically indestructible! (Mine has even survived a black bear ""attack,"" though the plastic bottom was not as fortunate.) I would highly recommend it."
5,The Best,I have a few hummingbird feeders out & this is the most used of them all. You could say they know what they like. This is the first one to be filled every time.
5,Inexpensive and fairly durable,"I've had a couple of these over the years and I would give them a solid reccomendation with one reservation, the foot bar that the birds stand on to sup will break after a couple years. A little super glue will fix this and I have gottten as long as 7 years wear from these. They are in my experience the best value for money when the cost is amortised over the length of service. They are also big enough that there is not the constant refilling that some of the rather minute feeders require, especially during the periods when the little birds have their feeding frenzies. If you are new to feeding the creatures,this one gets by best bet for ease of use, if you are an old hummer keeper, durability, price and year to year ruggednes recommend this one to you."
1,Defective merchandise,The base of the feeder was cracked and the water poured out. Had to be repaired before use.
2,"Good quality, but impossible to clean.","I was all set to love this feeder. I love the glass container, which holds a lot, stays looking clear, and is easy to clean thoroughly. I like the shape and appearance, and the birds love it. What I don't like, and what is forcing me to retire it, is that the bottom plastic compartment is very difficult to thoroughly clean, and so black mold builds up. If you're happy to clean the feeder and refill it everyday, this one would be fine. But if you're like me, and view the large capacity as an excuse to empty it only once a week - not good. It will be moldy by then, despite all the boiling of the food and hot soapy water washing of the feeder you do. Bummer."
2,hard to clean,"When I bought this I though that the bottom would open so that I could clean it. It doesn't. There is no hook on top, just a wire that you need to twist into a loop, which doesn't seem secure. I would not buy it again."
4,birds,Great feeder but still waiting for the birds. Need to change water more often too. it is a good one
2,How would I know?,"I had high hopes for this feeder, truly I did. I like the large capacity. I know my hummingbirds are attracted to the cheap red/yellow spouts. But I have no idea how to hang it. The box contained not a single instruction as to what to do with the screw-on lid with a hole in it and the flimsy red plastic/wire that comes with. Not so much as a picture hinting at optimal hanging procedures.So I have a relatively heavy glass hummingbird feeder that I'm supposed to (somehow) suspend from a tree with a 7 inch straight red plastic/wire? And once I add 30 ounces of fluid, how heavy will that be? And how can this tiny plastic and wire concoction possibily support it?Methinks this may go back to Amazon.com for lack of basic instruction and/or common sense. I have an email out to the manufacturer who can hopefully clue me in as to how to efficiently deal with the essential issues."
3,Won't be as easy to clean as I want,"While the reservoir is of ideal size the fill end is very small, about the size of a 20 oz soda bottle opening. I was looking for a feeder that had a wide reservoir mouth to make cleaning of the reservoir easier, this is not that feeder. I'm still looking for a feeder that will be easier to clean."
3,Like it,I like the size. We are not able to try because it is winter. We have had several with this type of base. They do seem to warp with the heat. I hope this does not.
5,Excellent product,"This is exactly what i have been looking for... this feeder is not available in our local stores. Had one many years ago, and finally found another. The 209 Model is the best they make. Wide glass jar mouth for easy cleaning, landing perches. And great price. Much better that plastic ones that discolor and crack with sunlight. I bought three."
1,Flaky piece of crap,"This product started okay, but just got worse and worse over time.Turns out it's full of plastic gears rubbing against metal and the plastic wears down, and some actuators won't click and open the safe anymore. So after a year or two it barely ever opens.Search for ""Sentry Safe won't open site:[...]"" on Google. Read all the horror stories from people agreeing in the comments.Now I finally got mine open again, but it won't close.Worst safe ever."
5,Great product,Sentry makes great safes in my opinion. Well built and perfect for what I needed it for. I actually like this one better than the sentry I have with the electronic opening.
1,Plastic gears = garbage,I had to rip the safe open with a demolition saw to get my valuables out. DO NOT buy this safe or any safe that Sentry makes.
2,Before you Buy...,"Please make sure you know what you are buying. I was highly disappointed in this tiny book. All it is is sayings (not from the show) accompanied by pictures from I love Lucy. Not worth it, if you want great pictures from the greatest television show buy: ""I Love Lucy : The Complete Picture History of the Most Popular TV Show Ever"" In my opinion the most complete book about I Love Lucy, but if pictures are all you want buy a Lucy calendar at your local book store."
5,I think I get it!,"I bought this book for my daughter in New York. Too many of the health issues she is dealing with sound like low thyroidism to me, though she has never been treated for it. I wanted her to become more knowledgeable, so I sent her the book. We have to know our bodies and accept responsiblity for our health. We need to look until we find doctors willing to work with us."
3,CHAIN SAW CAIN,Excellent cutting ability for a short time. Don't know if it is a function of actual cutting or inherent in chainsaws. Would definitly buy again.
4,Works OK but doesn't stay sharp for long,"Got this chain as a replacement for my Craftsman 16 chain saw. Chain fits and works well, however it doesn't stay sharp long. Worked awesome for about the first half cord of wood. After that I noticed the cutting getting a bit more labored. Now I'm thinking that I better order a replacement sooner rather than later. For 14 bucks I guess I shouldn't be complaining. You get what you pay for."
3,you get what you pay,"i bought this chain so i can cut down a couple of small trees(4 to be exact). by the time i was done, the chain was all dull. i expected better, but i guess you get what you paid for."
1,sophmoric and poorly laid out,"Yes, there was a Rat Pack, and yes, we all know how they got their name. If you're looking for the most basic information, and don't care that the author may or may not have taken an English class, this book is for you. Otherwise go somewhere else."
4,Good background info,"This book gives insight to a time when racial tensions were high, glamour was sought, and having a good time was a goal. very good background to all the players."
5,Copies are out there at the regular price!,"I did a search on the net for session 2 dvds. I found a couple of sites with the dvds in stock. I placed my order yesterday and today, I got my confirmation that my order has shipped!!!! The site I got my copy from is now sold out (www.cduniverse.com)."
1,What a Gyp!,"I just received my Season 2 after waiting almost a year ... and I didn't get past episode 1 before the dvd went absolutely FRITZ. What the hell is going on with this series? It's like the producers don't want the fans to buy it ... First my order was cancelled TWICE and now, having held my breath waiting for it to arrive, finally getting it, settling down and prepping myself for a lovely evening of Nikita Season 2 ... I find out it's all crap ... the dvd's should be wonderful but are on the fritz almost immediately ... they cost $90 Cdn but they don't work. I'm sending mine back, but I still want Season 2 ... is there anyone out there that thinks I'll actually get a copy that works? at some point? sometime? anyone else have any idea where to buy this?"
5,LA Femme Nikita-The complete Second Season,"Ok, first I'm also a member of columbia house DVD club and imagine me seeing my favorite TV show and (regardless of the price) bought the first season and sat down and watched it all the same day now mind you, i have no idea when the second season is coming out so i'm patiently waiting and place my order at the first mention of the second season coming out.Imagine me can't wait to get my order and being told that the promotion was cancelled, that's a travesty. I was heart broken and had plans to stay home and watch my show, while my friends went out (which i rarely do). I have no idea why the show got cancelled in the first place. That was the best show, i schedule my classes around Nikita so i won't miss a show. So Warner Bros please release the DVD and regardless of the price again i am willing to pay for it. Just don't deprive us(fans of the show) our hearts desire. We're eagerly waiting"
1,FEH on the WB,"Why was it cancelled at the last minute? You KNOW you have people who are interested in watching this series again, or is it for the same lack of concern for the fans that the show was canceled in the first place! BOO HISS to WB"
4,La Femme Two,The second season is very well done. The characters seem to show more depthand the story line keeps you guessing.
3,The reason books go out of print,Its a really old book that I recently read. Its confusing and hard to read. I have seen stereo instructions that are easier.
5,Wonderful Sweden,"I already wrote about this DVD I was so happy to see in swedish language with english subtitles. I really love Sweden, swedish thrillers (Mankell)I'm sorry it's not possible to buy it on amazon.fr. Let's be european citizens ! From now on, countries are not important anymore !"
4,Bee Guard Flowers a Must,This particular model Hummingbird feeder is a must for my back yard. We seem to have an abundance of bees and wasps who naturally swarm on the flowers of the feeder. The bee guard flowers keep the bees and wasps away so the hummers can feed. I would be interested in purchasing replacement bee guard flowers but to date cannot locate these without purchasing a whole new feeder.
4,Decent,"This offers a good overview of SQL 2005 and its new features, plus will be sufficient for those who need an intro to SQL server in general. The book came out a while back and unfortunately was not thoroughly edited. There are sections where they refer to Enterprise Manager instead of Management Studio (2000 vs SQL 2005) and also they title a chapter ""SQL Server integration services"", but then the heading elsewhere is referred to as DTS (again, SQL 2000's ETL component). Those are small problems, though.Unlike another book on amazon that was rated highly (Developing with SQL Server 2005), this one extensively covers SSIS--that other one does not mention it in any way, which is a far more egregious ommission than a focused analysis of mirroring or partitioning."
5,excellent dvd,"an excellent dvd . cherrys presence adds such a free and fun quality to any band he has played with and this aspect stands out . ive always enjoyed his voice but the dvd brought to front what a great vocal storyteller he is . its amazing how freely , the band ""weaves"", (as other review mentions), in and out of jams, tune changes and stop and start themes . extremely organic . the electric bass and drummer have a great crunchy rolling funk thing going mixed with jazz swing. the way they work together kind of reminds me of the moroccan fusion band ""zahar"" . sax/pianist aplfelbaum plays several instruments all well . his piano intro to """"when the rain comes"" is outstanding. his compositions ""walk to the mountain"" and ""when the rain comes"" are excellent . they sound much like cherry compositions . definitely recommend ."
1,Didn't know it was squirrel proof!,"I've had this feeder for over a year and as a regular feeder, this is great. However I didn't realize it was squirrel proof until it popped up in my search for a new feeder. I've been watching a few obese squirrels run up my pole, reach over and gorge. Or they simply jump to the feeder and attach themselves to the sides as they shove seed and mix into their bulging mouths.Yes, it may pull the feeder down blocking the stations, but only after some time passes and then I have to lift it back up. If you have baffles then it's a great feeder, but there's very little squirrel proof about it. In fact my squirrels seem to love it and have gained lots of weight since its been out."
3,More info please,"The product blurb doesn't tell you that the Delta hardware is of a non-standard size.Dopey me, I bought it without knowing...To get this thing to brace my Avanir rack, I had to drill two new holes, cut off a bunch of excess metal (thanks Dremel), and bend the thing quite a bit.That said... After the unforeseen customization, the hardware did hold my rack, under duress, and is still holding today. Given that it also killed a Dremel cutting wheel in the process, I have to guess that the steel is decent quality."
2,Beware: Heavy Steel,"Nice and long to attach your bike rack to your bike, but beware, these things are really heavy steel. I only gave them 2 stars because they are cheap and they do the job, but I didn't mount them on my bike because they are so heavy. Not worth the extra weight. Take my advice, get more expensive aluminum ones that won't weigh you down."
2,BIrds are smarter than than the designers of this feeder,"Although this feeder appears very sturdy it leaves much to be desired. The center wire that runs through the center of the feeding bin allows for the feeder to spin wildly in the wind. I had to drill a hole on each side of the roof and attach a 'Y' shaped wire that eliminates that spin. Further, the feeding tray where the birds eat the seed has no drainage holes and fills with water. Again, I had to drill four small drain holes to correct that problem. All in all, the feeder is not worth the money unless they correct these flaws. Other than that, it's perfect."
2,Bird feeder,Does not workThe squirrel jumps from the ground and feeds awayI have adjusted to bar in many positions
3,Bird Feeder,"It worked great until, a big black bear decided to pull the metal rod over and eat the seeds.This was no fault of the design, it worked well against squirrels and chipmunks, but a bear is alittle much!!!"
3,"fun, diverting update of the story: nothing revolutionary","This isn't exactly your parents' Spider-man: no radioactive spider, yes internet, Uncle Ben has a ponytail. But in general, it's the basic Spider-man origin story: bitten by Mr. Osborne's experimental spider, Peter Parker develops the skills. Mr. Osborne injects himself with something and turns into a Goblin. Fight.Even though this isn't going to turn your ideas of Spider-man upside down (likeBatman: The Dark Knight Returnsdid), the art is good and the story is engaging. I haven't read the original Spider-man, but the story here largely parallels that of the Tobey Maguire movie. I totally look forward to reading Volume 2."
4,more...MORE!!!!,"This was an excellent reworking of the history of webhead - complete with astounding artwork and writing to measure up to the new generation while keeping the older folk in suspense. When is part two gonna come out ,what with the conclusion of spidey vs green goblin??? The only fault here is that the ending is open and it leaves us impatient for more!!!"
4,excellent product and value,"Product does as promised, airtight and no ants invaded it yet! The only minor issue is that you have to be careful when closing the lid; if you don't align it correctly it might actually not close properly and be lopsided. But once you get the hang of closing it properly it's a non-issue."
3,good product but not for me,"Good looking, but taller than I expected, and did not fit where I needed to put it. Biggest obstacle was the screw-off top. It would have been a pain to use that because two hands are needed, and I needed a flip top. The opening was also rather small, and my scoop did not fit. I returned it, but anyone who has the space, it is a nice product."
5,Finally found the right one,I've tried several different plastic bins and FINALLY I found one that is truely air tight. The outter lid even has a rubber seal to make it extra tight. The inner round top also has an rubber seal. There is no way bugs can get in!
5,Great quality and value,"I looked at many pet food storage containers prior to deciding on the Vittles Vault II. Although all the options seemed a bit pricey to me, the quality of the Vittles Vault II was by far the best. The container is very sturdy, not flimsy at all. It has rubber seals around both the outter edge and the inner twist off lid, sealing far better than any other brand I looked at. We purchased the 40 lb. size, which does not quite fit a 37.5 lb. bag of Purina Pro Plan. I like the tall, slender design which saves floor space."
3,"Great container, but arrived cracked","I bought two Vittles Vault IIs to store dog food for my puppies. It arrived today, one in tact, but the other one arrived cracked. Amazon was great and is sending me a replacement right away, but I wonder if the plastic is not too thin, weak or brittle. I am guessing the plastic won't hold up too well over time."
5,Radio Drama at it's greatest! A must-read!,"6 delightful stories equally thrilling and spooky await you in this new arrival from Canadian writer Jack J. Ward.Scripts such as 'Gluttony: Soul Survivor' and 'The Hitchhiker' not only keep you on the edge of your seat and raise the hairs on the back of your neck, they also provide a unique insight into humanity, and address issues we all deal with on a daily basis.I recommend this to anyone interested in reading one of the finest examples of macabre creativity that Canada has to offer.Whether or not you're a fan of radio drama, you'll love this book.And remember... sunsets are for demons."
5,essential!,"what Willie collection is complete without this one? Both voices are strong, and there is solid, thoughtful songwriting throughout. This CD still sells for a good reason. Half of the songs are about boozin', reflecting the spirit of the times for these two rascals. Must have."
5,Every Little Girls' Dream Necklace,This is a darling necklace. I got it for my 2 year old because she loves all my pretty jewelry. It is in fact 13 inches long as described. The teddy bear is a little under 1/4 inch tall by a little under 1/4 inch wide.It's the perfect size for a child and the chain is suprisingly durable for as dainty and pretty as it is. Any little girl who receives it will be very happy!
4,"ANOTHER GOOD ""LIVE"" OFFERING FROM BOC!","A fairly good sampling of the first half of their career. To include all BOC gems to that date would require a project at least twice as lengthy. It's particulary eventful to hear such a stirring rendition of the under-rated ""Joan Crawford"". The obligatory inclusion of ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"" still rocks. A good find for collectors of Live rock/metal recordings."
3,Why not provide replacements that don't need replacing?,"They fit. They go in easy. They come back out easy. We had 3 removed the first day. I have read some, and the color is indeed wrong. Yellow attracts bees. Red attracts hummingbirds. We finally had to buy these to replace missing ones because swarms of bees had moved in. The bees stayed and tried to get them off. We used some non-toxic glue that appears to be holding, though the bees seem to win over the hummingbirds.In summary, they need to be RED and they need to be UNREMOVABLE."
5,small yellow flowers,The flowers are pretty and will be put to good use. Thanks for your efficiency.
2,For Ed Wood Completists Only...,"Like many of the films from Something Weird Video, this one is a real train wreck. There's more than a little misogyny in the script, and the acting is nonexistent. The costumes and sets are deliberately cheesy, which will be a plus for fans of bad films.The real draw, however, is the presence of Valda (Night of the Ghouls) Hansen, one of Ed Wood's hangers-on. The movie was also part of Something Weird'sSexy Space Box Set, which includedSpace Thing (Special Edition)and Doris Wishman'sNude on the Moon.If you're into the Something Weird phenomenon, you might enjoy this film. And that's a big ""if."""
2,"Dream Theater couldn't get any better, but did they have to get worse?","I'm a huge fan of Dream Theater, owning all their studio albums, and some singles. I loved SFAM, I&W;, SDOIT, and Awake. After their peak at SFAM, I didn't expect them to release anything better. But I didn't expect them to release anything that was too bad.They did.Octavarium, flat out, isn't Dream Theater. No guitar or drum solos, not flourishes, no pretenstious and self-indulgent metal peices. Buy this if you like U2 or Coldplay, don't buy it if you like Dream Theater."
1,worst DT,"I ordered the disc when it came out. Listened to it, and hated it. I put it away for a while, and pulled it out recently. It still sucks. This band has been going down since 6DOIT. I loved I&W; and Awake. Both Amazing discs. When Awake came out, I couldn't stop playing it for months. This is just crap.If you are a fan of the real DT, and you haven't already done so, get your hands on a copy of JP's Suspended Animation. Now that CD rocks."
2,Ehhhh,"Another ""effort"" by a tremendously overrated band Dream Theater. Instead of continuing to produce the same dull music they made in the last whatever albums, they now decided to copy the ""greats"" of the 70's. Their greatest accomplishment remains the same up to this day: covering the whole Master Of Puppets album live. That's what they are capable of - covering other people's work, and they do it very well. This is very very sad, that a band with five skilled musicians in it can not write their own great music.I give it two starts(Collectors/fans only), because I am 100% sure that Dream Theater fans will find a lot of enjoyment here. If you're not a Dream Theater enthusiast, stay away.Of course, if this was a Dream Theater site, it would be rated great or perhaps even masterpiece, but we are rating ALL prog albums here, and I did my best at trying to be as tolerant and objective as I could"
2,BOOOOOOOOORING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I thought Infinity was gonna be their worst recording.Now I'm not so sure.At least it had a couple of good songs. This has none. No guitar solos, no progressive hooks and even James doesn't sound as good as before. These guys are clearly out of ideas. And then the lyrics... Sacrificed Sons is just pure s**t. It would be a decent tune if it had good lyrics. Nobody wants to hear this stuff anymore. Stop whining about what happened years ago. GET OVER IT !!! And isn't James Canadian ??? Weird..."
1,what is wrong with you people?,"Well, I never liked this band, i bought one of their cd's blind because someone recommended them, i glad i bought it for a dollar because it was at Hastings about 15 minutes later waiting to be traded for a real metal cd. I listened to this album, and it was horrible as well. I think the warehouses made an error on the tags because it reads ""Rock/Metal."" However, I kept my mouth shut about them. Then one of your fellow dream theatre fans named Jeremy Brackeen ""themetalbeast""had to go and slam Until the End by Kittie. How can you call these sad vocals that for some reason remind me of ""death cab for cutie"" metal vocals? This album is horrible. This band is horrible. No wonder they are so popular, the masses always seem to like crap. If you say this is metal, you must like A7X, Chaimera, Atreyu, Bloodsimple, and maybe the Backstreet Boys. Listen to real metal that you can actually bang your head to, not elevator music."
4,New to Dream Theater,"This album was my first by DT. My love for progressive rock might color my opinion, but this album has a very dramatic and ""heavy metal"" sound, but undeniable prog elements. The drama throughout the album feels like a lot of music from the 80s, but that's not a bad thing. :)It's a great album. I'm glad I bought it. The last two songs are standout hits, but all the others are VERY accessible and likable. I'm looking forward to collecting more albums by this band."
2,DT needs to take some time off,"Long time DT fan here, seen many of their shows. The record contract must have some tight requirements on how often they have to squeeze out albums. This cycle of heavy touring + quick album every two years is resulting in lots of weak efforts. Every album after Scenes From a Memory has consisted of perhaps 50% throwaway tracks. Octavarium is 75% throwaway. DT should take a vacation, and then sit down and really write an album. They're such talented musicians that even their rushed garbage is amazing, but it's not very good music. Octavarium is mostly cheese and DT formula. I hope we don't see another DT album until 2008 or 2009. Maybe that will give them enough time to develop enough good ideas to fill a whole album. On a related note, if you get ""Score"" the live album, Labrie's voice has never sounded better. Enjoy."
2,What is this?,I love Dream Theater. Now that I have said that what happened to the guitars? I was very excited about this album comming out but now that I have it I'm very dissapointed. It is way too soft to be a Dream Theater disc. Trust me you are better off picking up James Labrie's latest solo disc. At least it rocks hard.
4,"Not their best work, but still mostly good stuff","I've had this CD for a couple months now, and I've got to say it's really grown on me. Well..to be specific, about half of it has grown on me. The other half just won't stick.As with their last couple of albums, 'Octavarium' could benefit from a little helpful editing. There are 4-minute sections of songs that could easily be cut out. I wish that they would either adopt a 'lean & mean' approach on their next album, or release a separate CD with the 'radio edits' of all the songs.One last note: The title track was such letdown. It could have been a Floyd-esque classic...but there's just nothing there (except for yet another boring, song-length Jordan Rudess solo). It's one of the thinnest songs they've ever done.Aside from the music, the CD booklet contains some of the best artwork that Hugh Syme has ever done. I'm really glad he's finally hooked up with DT."
2,Pointless,"Dexterity is pointless without good writing. I can't find anything on this cd that is from the heart or well thought out. I've been hanging in there w/ the last 2 cds, but DT really needs a writer and a producer. I don't want images + awake pt2, but I do want the same amount of heart, passion and well thought out lyrics and melodies. They could do an acoustic albulm or an acapella cd, but no matter what style, it has to have Well thought out melodies. Singers don't write well thought out melodies. Writers who understand what notes fit over chords do that. Instrumental sections should also be well thought out. Not just random pastings. Get Kevin back + hire a producer. Untill then, Rudess is just going noodle elp + various other influences from his past. Rudess needs music on paper. He can read....not necessarilly write. Also what's up w/ being influenced by the younger generation.Since Kevin left, they have been copying everyone from u2 to tool + muse."
4,The Kittie fan is a complete moron. This is coming from a 15 year old.,"Man, you are a loser. You know... if you call Kittie REAL metal there is something wrong with you. First of all, they lack one thing. Can you guess what it is? Musicianship. You know, you really need to get your facts straight of you're arguement is about something you obviously have no idea about. Hell, these guys might not be that heavy at all, but at least they aren't simple-minded barbarians like Kittie, and Hatebreed. If you want to listen to music that is less fit for the mind of a livestock animal, check out BTBAM or Dream Theater. And guess what? BTBAM blows Kittie out of the water with ""heaviness"" but see, they're REAL MUSICIANS. If those of you who want to look like you belong in a zoo, listen to Kittie, or Hatebreed.Thanks for your ignorance."
2,Not worth buying.....if only you could rent a CD....,"I am a huge DT fan, I have seen them from their IAW days (and my old band opened for them for their ""Awake"" tour), but this CD left me wanting.More guitar riffs.More good vocal lines (with less processing).More DT.Less keyboards.Sorry, but ever since Kevin Moore left, the real sound of DT has suffered. While I loves Scenes, a great concept and a great tour, I just cannot get into Jordan. He plays too much from his head and not enough from his heart, something Kevin did effortlessly. A single listen to IAW and you'll hear more passion and more complementary keys. Not just showing you have chops (which Jordan has PLENTY of-the man can really play well, but his heart isn't there like Kevin's was).Sorry guys, I cannot get behind this one like I could the other ones.Go back to the old days when you wrote melodies and really parted your songs out in ways that fit. One listen to TOT and this new one and you'll see who's in charge, the FNG."
1,Dissapointarium,"Have to say I'm big fan of DT classical releases (Awake, Metropolis, Images and words) and I believed these guys reached the bottom line and wouldn't do worse than they did in ""Train of Thought, how wrong I was, the only talent put here is the talent to make the entire album boring and disappointing, This is a class of what ..you young rock musicians reading this.. shouldn't do. Every single song is a crap. What a waste of money I did.I can't explain in more details this album cause my lack of English, but If you want to buy it anyway I suggest you see the lower rated reviews first...believe me they express accurately what this title is ."
3,"Does Octavarium mean ""return to 80's ballad's""?","I was really disappointed with this CD. I got it for xmas and was really looking forward to it since I liked Train of Thought so much. But after 5 or 6 listens, I just can't in all honesty say this is a good CD.It sounds to me like the band was going thru the motions of putting out a CD. I don't hear many interesting musical ideas. Some vocals and melodies seem forced and lack orginality... I even hear a few melody lines from past Dream Theater CDs.I will give it a few more listens because I really want to like this CD... my ToT and Scenes CD's are wearing out from use.If you like ballady 80's rock, then give this a listen, else I'd recommend waiting for the next release."
2,Huge Creative Disappointment,"After great albums like Scenes from a Memory, 6DOIT, and Train of Thought, this album blows. Christ, one of these songs is a U2 ripoff. It's bad enough they rip off Pink Floyd in this album with the boring 24 minute title track, but U2? Why in God's name would they ripoff U2? The song in question is called I Walk Beside You, and is just one of the bad songs on this album. The only song worth listening to on here is Panic Attack. The Root of All Evil would seem promising on paper, because it's part of a ""trilogy"" with The Glass Prison and This Dying Soul, but the song is weak. Don't waste your money."
5,Deeper than you think.,"This album takes a major step foward in terms of explicit and implicit structure. There are all sorts of allusions that, I think, people are missing out on. Read up on the liturgy of the octive - pay attention to the signifigance of having seven parts of ""one song"" comprise the begining and the end of the album.This is not casual listening. This is something different from the balls to the wall metal that DT has been known for as of late. This is music to be analyzed. This is something to be soak in. It's not flashy. It's deeper than that.My only found fault with the album would have to be the lyrics. These are not nearly as strong as on other albums.However, I believe that most hardcore DT fans will find plenty of things to love about this album. I know I have."
4,good on its own,"there's something in here for everyone. you may need to skip a track if it's not your cup of tea, but the album delivers just fine; worth getting."
2,Dreaming down,"2 1/2DT continued to deteriorate through the 00's, often lapsing into recycled metal guitar cliches or just flat out embarrassing balladry, but with an obligatory epic providing the undeniable kick-butt climax they flaunt full amounts of filler in fans faces."
5,These Walls alone is enough for FIVE stars,"These Walls is an awesome song. It is one of Dream Theater's best. Ok, I guess as complete album, it is not a collection of great licks. But These Walls is an amazing song. I don't know why I love it so much; maybe it speaks to something in my soul. I also think it just fits together as a great piece of music and is itself one of Dream Theater's greatest songs. If I was in hard rock band, I would encourage band mates to cover it as much as we could.I lost interest for awhile when Scenes from a Memory came out; I just felt no life in the music from that one. I couldn't get into the dark story the lyrics told. Train of Thought is prog-metal to the core and Octivarium brings out more of their new keyboardist's talents. Dream Theater is back!!!! I saw them live in Irvine recently; they are by far the best in all hard rock genres right now!"
3,Just okay,"Standout tracks are Panic Attack, Root of All Evil, and Sacrified Sons.A nice return to prog riffs, but unfortunately, just when you are getting into a riff, it changes. This is normal, but in this case most of the best riffs are at the start of songs and then they downshift into something totally different. This album reminds me alot of Falling Into Infinity - more mellower, but not as polished. James Labrie returns to higher vocals, some of which sound like his voice is just about to crack. Reminds me of the (often) flat vocals on the live album Once in a Livetime. My favorite album is Six Degrees. Octavarium is better than TOT - by far, but not up to Six Degrees."
4,Still something missing ...,"I remember the first time I listened to I&W; and Awake. I was blown away. I can listen to both of those CDs at any time and still enjoy them.From then on, I haven't been moved. I'd like to blame the change on the loss of Kevin Moore's lyrical contribution (which they surely miss) and the inclusion of Portnoy as a lyricist (he's absolutely brutal) but I'm sure that's just part of the problem. I will say that I enjoy FII and Six Degrees - it took me until this year (yes, this year) to appreciate Six Degrees. The others I can live without.I've enjoyed my first few listens and I'm sure most fans will, too. This is certainly better than ToT, which was a total mess. I think if I stop hoping for a I&W; and Awake-type release and give up on lyrical masterpieces as in previous releases (pre SFAM), I'd enjoy DT that much more.Solid, solid effort - though ""safe"" in a few areas. Good, not nearly their best, though."
3,Dream theater like muse,"I really like the muse album 'absolution', apparently so did dream theater. If you only check out 1 song, check out 'panic attack'."
1,Historical information in this book was manipulated,"In this book, unfortunately due to powerful anti-Iranian (Persian) activities and the typical incompetence of the Islamic Republic that occupies Iran, the southern states of the Persian Gulf who have only come to existence thanks to foreign powers, have slowly become more brazen.The enemies of Iran should know, so long as there is one Iranian (Persian) alive with blood pumping through his or her heart, even the thought of taking one grain of Iranian (Persian) soil, will strongly be opposed and defeated.As a result, the historical information in this book was manipulated."
1,They sent me a doorknob,I guess it is kind of funny except that i need the bulb to light the disco ball for a halloween party. I will try else where...Yeah they sent me a Door Knob....well I guess they both are kind of round and shiny
3,Penthouse Massage,This was pretty much what I expected but not as much as I would have hoped for. Don't be an idiot and buy this thinking it is an instructional video. Buy it because it's a Penthouse video and that's what you are wanting.
2,Very Low Ink,"This is my lst time purchasing an HP black ink cartridge from this company. This cartridge didn't last a month. I don't print alot, I thought it would last at least 3 months. Believe me, the cartridge ink was very very low. I want order from you again."
1,Not Enough Ink,"I bought this as it was a good price (much cheaper than local stores) so I was very disappointed when I received it and saw that although it was in a regular Hewlett Packard package it was either old or inferior as the quality of ink was very poor from the start and dried up very quickly. Will not buy ink from you again and would have asked for my money back but needed the ink that day for what printing I could get out of it. Don't buy ink, even HP, from Amazon (unless this was just a fluke)."
5,HP 98 Black Inkjet Print Cartridge,This ink is excellent in not smearing and smudging. I can highlight on the ink and it doesn't smear or bleed which is excellent too.
4,Maybe a little bit too agressive for the average American,"Superb pictures of beautiful women who are pure fiction, of course, but super realistic ones. A lot of theses pictures show sado and bondage scenes which are definately not meeting everybody's taste. But those who purely enjoy viewing beautiful women in ""surrealistic dreams have become true"" scences will just love this book."
4,"Great art, poor publishing","Hajime Sorayama is an incredible artist. His work speaks for itself. I truly wish I could give this book 5 stars, but many of the images are spread across 2 pages, so the binding interrupts and distorts the image. For an artist of this caliber, I'd expect the publisher to understand what this does to the quality and integrity of the image."
1,Disgusting; cruelity to women; bondage; sick!,"This is Hajime's worst work! It is exemplary of a sick mind. It reveals his darkest feelings and his innermost hatred towards women, as a whole. Lovers of art will be disgusted by this work. It is demented and should not even be in print."
1,It's not worth for price,Please don't buy this product this does not worth more than 5 dollars the manfacturing of the rubber is so poor and its installation on the stamp is terrible. Bad buy
4,Gets the job done,"Letters and numbers are a little small and on lengthier stamps I run out of letters. Otherwise, it serves its purpose. I have used over 100 times and it is still going strong.Hope this helps!"
2,Cannibal coup misses main course,"I don't agree entirely with the comments below; i found the book somewhat slow and turgid compared to other much better Sadler Casca books. Perhaps the fault was in the subject area and time. The start of the book mentions Casca fighting in the US Civil War which to me would have been a far better story than this one. Casca spends a fair part of the book seasick in his bunk and that sums up most of this offering. Some of the historical anecdotes were interesting and fairly accurate which tells of some research, and the author had some fruity passages relating to the cannibal feast, but there was too much feasting and fornication, rather like The Liberator by Paul Dengelegi, which became boring after the first two occasions. This could really have been written in two days and felt like it at times."
3,A good nudie cutie.,"A pair of fun, silly movies at a bargain price. The best part here is the (optional) commentary by David Freidman. These films are vintage nudie flicks, not Lawrence of Arabia, so the low budget production shouldn't be a problem. I also don't believe you need a strong stomach to watch these movies, unless you're very very sensitive.Thank the powers that be that there's a place ...to make these films available to those of us who like this stuff!"
5,Exact Replacement,"I only needed 2 but the smallest order was 4, so I have 2 spare. They fit my red hour-glass 4-flower style hummingbird feeder perfectly. I have noticed that the sun seems to rot the plastic on these feeders prematurely. I think a shady spot might make the inexpensive parts last longer, and of course bring them in in the winter.Arrived quickly in a padded USPS envelope."
2,disappointment,"Our kit didn't work well at all. We were only able to get the 'flashing light' and the 'clicking telegraph' to work, and then even after extensive tinkering. The radio set-up took about an hour, and never worked despite much extra effort.We had much better luck with the ScienceWiz Physics kit, but this Inventions kit was a big disappointment."
1,Our's also broke,This appears larger online than in real life.Very cute and my daughter loved it... but it didn't take long before it broke.Unfortunate.
1,Poorly designed and very flimsy,"One of the plastic clips broke the very first day. Two more broke over the next few days. The dashboard mount was useless, it simply would not stick. It did stick to the windshield, but on one hot summer day, the suction cup (which was black) melted to the hot windshield and after that it would not stick anymore. I replaced this unit with a ""Mobile Grip-It"" windshield mount (with a clear suction cup) from Walmart which works much better.The Garmin SOFTWARE is great, but this mount is NOT."
2,Basic Product,One piece came broken; the materials are generally not that good but it does the job with repeated use. You get what you pay for.
3,Generally Effective,"This was a good purchase because we were able to get out amazing amounts of lint from the dryer. We liked that multiple pieces came with the kit. Our main complaint is that the vacuum extension part cracked after only a few uses. Otherwise, the brushes work well."
3,OK product,I've only used these tools a few times since getting them. Be very careful when using the long/brush tool - it kept getting caught somewhere when I used it inside the dryer's lint trap (works fine in the dryer vent going to the outside).
1,Poor Design/ Quality,"I was looking for a efficient way to keep my dryer vent clear, this is not it! The larger brush with the 10 ft. shaft looked like a good method to keep lint build-up from accumulating. The design would work well if the flexible shaft was stiffer. The shaft is so flimsy it will only go in the exaust vent tube as far as you can push by holding the back of the brush head. The shaft just kinks up if you try to push on it. The only thing the shaft can be used for is to pull the brush back out."
1,Vacumn attachment worthless,The flat attachment for vac. is useless.....vacumn won't pick up lint off my floor with it attached..... I used an Oreck vacummn....the one that is advertised to pick up a bowling ball.
3,vacuum attachment not flexible,Attachment to vacuum cleaner should be more flexible to accomodate a Variety vaccum hose sizes.
2,Some Wonderful Ideas,"""The Having of Wonderful Ideas"", by Eleanor Duckworth, was not quite what I expected. Although I learned from some aspects of the book I expected more""ideas"" that could be easily understood and incoporated into classroom activities. I felt that the essays on the many experiments conducted by the author and Piaget were far too lengthy, almost drowning out any real ""wonderful ideas"". This book is not easy to read, and may leave the reader struggling to read to the end. However, as I stated previously I did learn a few things, but they came too far and few between the lengthy essays."
2,Good For New users,"If you are first time user of Dreamweaver 4, then go for this book only. It explains every aspects of Dreamweaver 4 in nice and logical order. The language is also simple and easy to understand. If you are expert user of Dreamaweaver 3, then do not buy any book for Dreamweaver 4, as Dreamweaver 4 has little new features then Dreamweaver 3. hasitdave@yahoo.com"
4,Gayle Lynds' The Coil,"I received an ARC of Gayle Lynds' The Coil. Anyone who purchases the finished product will get their money's worth. It's going to be difficult to tell you too much without spoilers. This book engaged my attention from the beginning. If you like intrigue, secret agendas, American & British intelligence services, and conspiracies, read this book. There is also a hint of romance. I found myself skipping descriptive portions because I wanted to find out what happened next. I later went back & re-read these portions because Gayle does have fine descriptive talents. This book is exciting and has twists & turns that surprise both you the reader and the characters involved."
3,Mysterious case of misleading advertising,"I was intrigued by description of the author as ""Mrs Ludlum"" and am very disappointed. Bought the book expecting Ludlum but got very average story instead. Basic premise is indeed ludlumesque but the writing just doesn't hold it. I wish books were like any other merchandise because then I'd be first to line up and demand my money back. My advise for readers: do not read if you're expecting Ludlum. For publisher and author: drop references to Ludlum, because it is misleading advertsisng."
1,Tiresome.,"It's incomrehensible that someone would give this 4 or 5 stars. I was interested in this book since I heard the author say she researched the Bilderberg Group for 8 years. Full disclosure, I'm only halfway in but instead of providing any illumination as to the Bilderberg Group agenda, besides the obvious (globalization) this follows a tired formula.But the worst part is what one reviewer correctly described as the tin-eared dialogue. In addition, there are the fanciful names, the lack of believable emotion or plot, and, again, the writing overall. This is just terrible; the writers who really did this well were LeCarre in The Spy who Came in from the Cold and Alan Furst provides some really nice writing to go with his spy novels."
3,"The Rachmaninov is dazzling but cold, the Ravel noisy and ham-handed","These are recordings made fairly early in Fleisher's career -- 1957 for the Rachmaninov, 1958 for the Ravel. By now the legacy of Fleisher and Szell on disc is a testament to a great partnership. The two have no intention of making the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini sound Russian, or for that matter soulful. Orchestra and soloist are reazo-shar, which gives Fleisher the opportunity to dazzle; nothing is very moving emotionally, however. A fascinating comparison would be to William Kapell, who made a similarly propulsive, unsentimental account (reissued on RCA) bfore his tragic early death. I would gladly keep it as my only version despite mediocre mono sound. The Fleisher-Sezell Ravel concerto, from which I expected a great deal, is hard-edged and clattery, miles away from the correct approach."
3,"Decent enough, not great.","First the box said it has ball bearings, which is a lie.2nd, the rubber plugs come off very easily.3rd, it's pretty short. I'm 6 foot and I have to make sure to keep my hands low or else.It's decent, but I would not buy it again."
5,So far so good...,"This rope has a great weight to it, which make it nice for speed work. If you're going to be doing double-unders with this, though, you better be good at them. If you screw up this rope is going to punish your legs and arms."
5,Very good jump rope,"This is a well made jump rope and I really like using it. I recommend using it barefoot as you will want to get better really quick when the beads smash into your toes when you mess up. The weight and length are perfect. This is a very simple form of exercise that will increase stamina, coordination, discipline (if used barefoot lol), and also focus."
1,Caution!,"While the Magic Tree House storybooks are among my son's favorites, the research guides do not compare. This research guide in particular has a few errors in it. For one, the pharaoh Zoser in the book is actually spelled Djoser. Also the book mentions slaves building the pyramids. That is just plain false. While I would highly recommend the storybooks, I would stay away from the research guides."
5,"This is a ""fantabulous"" book","This book provides a lot of information about ancient Egypt. For example, I learned how ancient Egyptians lived and what they did in their everyday life. The book has a solid chapter about ancient Egyptian art. I was surprised at how many different types of art there were. Ancient Egyptians painted, weaved and made pots, statues and jars out of clay. They also made jewelry and large pots out of gold. I also learned about their burial chambers in the pyramids. They put paintings and all of their belongings in the tombs for use in their after lives. The pyramids are made of big stone blocks. Workers would move the heavy stone blocks into the shape of a pyramid. The book describes how the ancient Egyptians also built large ships and small canoes to go down the Nile River. This book is an interesting introduction to ancient Egypt. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about ancient Egypt and the pyramids."
4,beginner in-line skates,Good reasonably priced product for the beginning young skater. Three year old Granddaughter learned to use them very quickly. Adjustable fit was great too especially when ordering on line with no opportunity to try them on first.
2,Displeased with conditon of item,"I was very upset when I opened the box. I ordered two pair of the skates for my daughters 7 and 9 for Christmas. Both of the boxes that the skates were in were damaged. One of them was torn open. It looked like I was shipped returns. The skates were suppose to come with a charm and only one had it. The box that was torn open, it looks like it had fallen out. Beacuse it was a Christmas present, I didn't have time to return them but felt bad to give them in such conditon. Especially since they were a brand new item. As far as the skates go, they are hard for them to put on by theirselves, so takes me awhile to put them both on,but they like them."
2,There's bass and not much else,"I've tried a lot of different earbuds before -- cheap ones they give away on airplanes or conferences, super high end ones, and ones in between. I must say that I can probably tolerate almost any pair thrown at me (although, of course, I do prefer some over the others). This is the first pair of earbuds I actually actively dislike -- there is weird artificial bass that is overemphasized to the point where it is distracting, almost like a pressure in your ear whenever anything on the lower end of the sound spectrum rolls around. Everything else sounds OK (I would say slightly muddled) but the bass just is horrible....."
4,Great Sound ! No Volume Control ( so not a full replacement ),"I've used Tunebuds back in 2005 so I knew I wouldn't expect any less that great sound quality and comfort.Pro- great sound ( Deep quality bass )- great comfort- looks great- It's black- Lanyard wire- Also, you don't have to turn your iPod/iPhone up anymore than half in any usual environmentCon- Doesn't have volume control.The only thing I could see as dangerous is not being as aware of your environment but thats the risk with all in-ear product.I'm very accustom now to having the volume control on the wire so that might take getting use to.I love them, and I'm sure you will love them too.Enjoy."
1,Terrible dvd,DON'T BUY... It is terrible as a matter of fact two of the DVD's in the collection are the same..A total let down and I can't believe they are selling the DVD like this.A total waste of money...
4,Great Fun with our OWN bubbles,"This item is GREAT!! I hear lots of complaints about other bubble solutions not working with other toys so here is the secret. MAKE YOUR OWN SOLUTION!!!!! Any solution you make at home is 10 times as potent as the bought stuff. They water it down so you always have to buy more. Here is the recipe:12 Cups of water1 cup Dish soap (not the cheap stuff, and NOT dishwasher)3 tablespoons of glycerin (drug stores sell-lotion isle)If you want to make a MUCH larger batch:4 gallons of water in a 5 gallon bucket6 cups of dish soap (not cheap or dishwasher)1 cup of glycerinYou can store this liquid forever and it will still work so make a lot if you can and store it in sealable containers!Hope this helps everyone!!!!"
5,Spencer Taylor........WOW!,"After all these years, Spencer Taylor is still fronting the Highway QC'c. And, doing a commendable job. Been following these guys since the 60's. They still keep me on the edge of my seat. Sing on my brothers"
4,Great book,I suggest this book to anyone in ministry that wants to reach out to their community. It has practical and helpful ideas.
4,getting outside,this book does a good job of helping Christian see the potential for getting involved in their community. Rusaw does a good job of not only telling the pluses but he also shares some of the challenges as well.
3,Not 8000 Hours!,"I've had three of these burn out already. Used as a standard replacement bulb. The ones that are still going are Great, but I'm a tad disappointed at the burn-out rate."
1,Short Life,I purchased the lamps because they were inexpensive. Most burned out within a month. Not a real value. I since purchased dimmable lamps at 1000 bulbs.com and they have been in use for well over a year.
5,Gorgeous in all ways,"This is an astonishingly beautiful books of color photographs of Guatemalan people (and their animals) amidst their traditional woven textiles. The introduction gives a respectful and knowledgable overview. Vecchiato: ""Mayan weaving is a celebration of feelings shared in common by an entire ethnic group."" He provides background and a brief description of the harsh political climate of Mayan Guatemala. The pictures are full of life and joy. Market scenes; babies, children, parents, old folks; processions; plus tender and intimate moments - along with the statement that ""they will never reveal themselves completely to any one of us."" This is a wonderful book."
2,Not effective for ink stains,"This product is not effective for the removal of even small (non-permanent) ink stains from clothing. I should have known better, as Delta Carbona 404/24 ""Stain Devils #3"" Ink & Crayon Remover has worked very well for me in the past, but it was not an Amazon Prime option, I decided to to give this Soilove product a try. Bad choice."
2,Not As Good as Tide or Original Dawn,This product was not as effective as Tide liquid detergent when used directly on most food-based stains. Nor was it as effective as Original Dawn liquid dish soap on oil-based stains.
1,Poorly packaged,"I'm not sure how this product works because it arrived completely soaked, so I returned it. The person that packed it had placed two pieces of clear tape crisscrossed over a previously-opened bottle-top and then had (thankfully) placed the bottle in a zip-lock bag! The label was smudged due to the liquid sitting on it during transit so I could only read the very middle of the labels on both sides. The reviews were high; however I'm debating whether or not to purchase another bottle. I'm disappointed because I really wanted to test this!If you're looking for a great product for carpet cleaning, check out Folex Instant Carpet Spot Remover!! I ordered this at the same time and Folex arrived in good unopened condition and I'm very impressed! Toying with the idea of using it on my laundry, even though it's intended for use on carpets. :)"
3,Not as good as advertised!!,Tried Soilove on a baby white shirt (soak for 5 min and then do laundry) with puree stains and it doesnt help as much as I wish to
5,Members of Congress Should Be Ashamed,"...for being such Cowards and not standing up to the Clinotn Administration regarding the death of these women and children. Despicable, I am truly embarrassed to be a U.S. citizen. After you see this documentary you will too."
1,Waco-Rules of Engagement,"My girlfriend bought this for my birthday using my account. By the time my birthday came and I found out this dvd would not play it was to late to return it! Now I have a broken tape that I can not take back for my birthday. May well be a great video. Just open it before the guarantee runs out, even if it's a present."
2,Good filmmaking does not make for good facts,"The movie is well-made and not overtly partisan, which is why it was Academy Award nominated and which is why it is so dangerous. There are crucial misrepresentations in the movie. Contrary to the what the movie says, Branch Davidianism is not simply an offshoot of SDA church -- it has little to do with SDA, Koresh has a long history of violent erratic behavior. We see Koresh as a spiritual person but we don't see the testimony of the weeping 14 year-old talking about her first sexual experience with Koresh four years before.Probably the most misleading part of the movie comes from the interpretation of the infrared film. There is no way you can look at such film and definitively say the things that were said in that movie.It is a well-made version of Chariots of the Gods or some of the other ""take a theory and make it fact"" school of documentary we have. Two stars."
5,surprised- -,"Surprised they would ever release this on dvd. The VHS version came and went without making much of an impact.One of many non-dvd documentaries that prove how much media distortion exists. Ask youself and anyone your age, how much do you really know about the Branch Davidians and what happened that day? Released about 10 years ago, it still packs a punch, don't let the slow start fool, everything builds up to the stand-off. An exceptional ""Everything You know is Wrong"" piece of cinema. Also keep on the lookout for the original ""Paradise Lost"" docu on dvd, which is just as good."
5,Big Brother Goes Berserk,"The federal government of the United States of America would never deliberately murder 86 men, women, and children as revenge for what amounted to a modern day Custer's Last Stand, would they? Don't be so sure. Before I saw this film, nothing anyone could have told me would have convinced me that the government willfully or deliberately contributed to the death of the Branch Davidians. However, damning testimony coming directly from congressional hearings and scientific analysis of infrared photography serves a chilling plate of reality that the image of the jack booted federal goon may not simply be the product of the militia movement's imagination. Whether you're pro-government, anti-government, or just plain neutral, you owe it to yourself to see this excellent documentary before you draw any final conclusions on what really happened at Waco. It'll make your blood run cold."
1,"Good, Informative","With the exception of the tracking on the VHS tape, its still a great video. When I watched it, I found out something I didn't previously know about the Waco massacre. I don't want to spoil it here but as the branch Davidian compound was burning down, they showed footage of gun fire coming from the compound. (I never saw that on the news or in other Waco documentaries) The shooting lastest for about a good 5 minutes till they all burned to death. Everyone in Congress were on their feet watching the final minutes of the Davidian's lives."
2,Unable to watch,Be extra careful of DVD's that are for the Europian ONLY. Should not have been sold for the USA markey.
5,Congress rips them up!,"This video will show you hands down the corruption of the government. Unlike 911, this was not covered up very well at all. A lot of evidence was avaiable.I was VERY VERY amazed by this one, but not at all shocked."
2,Precision Drop Spreader,This spreader may be alright for fertilizer but hardly anything else. I'm very unhappy with it and would not recommend it.
4,very informative,i have used this book for my thesis paper concerning the legalization of marajuana for medicinal purposes and it was my lifeline. very factual and very informative!
4,great product,"wish it was just a little bit more cushioned but it did make a huge difference. I liked my firm mattress but i used to feel the springs! this pad solved that. i also wish the sides were more taught on the sides, it wraps around and under the mattress well, but hangs a bit loose. Definately wont slip off though. I think its that way in case you have a bigger in height than usual mattress?"
2,Mattress Pad,"If I had the opportunity to purchase a different mattress pad I would. The quality of the material is poor. The very first time I put it on our bed, the material tore. Keep searching for a different brand."
2,(Was) Excellent quality,"This was my review for the first pad I purchased (5 stars):""This is by far the best mattress pad I have owned. I found it to be of good construction. It is deep enough to fit my 15"" mattress without slipping off. The side material is sheer cotton, but I have had no issues with it as some of the negative reviewers have. It is far superior to the elastic material you find on most deep pads. And the product is made in the USA, so by purchasing it you are helping folks out in this country rather than sending money and jobs overseas.""So, I purchased a second. The product has changed. The styling is different and it is now lower quality. Instead of cotton, the sides are now the papery-thin material described by other reviewers. Sure enough, my finger punched right through it, just like other reviewers. Looks like the company has decided to cut costs and corners. Look elsewhere."
1,Tore like paper,"I tore the mattress pad as I was putting it on for the first time, and as I continued to put it on, being extra careful after the first tear, I still managed to tear it again. The covering of the pad, and the material that goes around and under the mattress, might as well have been made of tissue paper."
5,"Should have bought this one, first!","This is the best mattress pad I've purchased. I've tried to get away with cheap ones thinking that it didn't really matter cuz it was under the sheet anyway. However, one tore the first time I stretched it on. Another one wasn't deep enough and kept coming up. This one has MORE THAN ENOUGH room for a deep mattress and our memory foam topper. It stretches on easily and feels nice enough to just sleep on top of it! I'll stick to this one....if I ever need another one!"
4,Very Nice,"This is a great mattress pad. Thanks to the full sides and elastic all the way around, it stays put. Doesn't bunch up and washes up nice. Hard to find a good mattress pad these days but this one does exactly what you want it to do. Will buy another one when the time comes ... just hope they're still making them this well."
1,Cheap Quality,"My wife wanted this electric skillet because of its size. However, on arrival we saw defects in the plating and it just appeared to be a cheap quality. Wouldn't recommend buying this product. We returned it on arrival."
1,7-inch skillet,This has been the worst buy. It blew up on the first use!! Certainly not worth any money. My advice would be - don't bother.
1,non-stick?,have used this produt 3 times and cleaned as per instructions.no-stick coating is coming off. not sure if i should use because teflon is probubly not good for you
1,Not Happy,"I found this pan to be of poor quality and does not cook meat well, will not get up to heat."
1,Mini Skillet,Very disappointed. I had to attach the handle which is not very.stable. No temperature settings. You turn th nob until you think it is hot enough. Non-stick surface is no non- stick. I expected a much better product.
3,7 inch electric skillet,Small skillet nice and compact food beginning to stick now and handle not too secure.
1,Returned it due to malfunction,"I bought it thinking it would be great for one burger or steak. Wrong. It is not a good purchase and it can be a safety hazard. The first time I used it, following all the directions in the booklet that came with it, it burned all the teflon off the bottom of the pan. The heat setting was set as shown in the booklet. Second time I went to use it, the handle lock broke off with very little pressure. It is now totally unusable. Not a good buy at all!!"
3,MAXI-MATIC 7 inch Skillet,"Bought this to run on Sailboat1000w inverter.It only draws 600w. Un fortunatly the glass top is chipped.The warrenty does not cover the glass! Hope you don't get one with glass really broken or cracked.The handle attaches the best I've seen. The cord is 2 feet---3 would be better.There should be a light for when heating! Seems like the off cycle is a little long. It does cook and will be good for one or two people. Like all teflon lined stuff, it burns easily.The Good is that it cooks and is not too big.It is light and I may put suction cops on the feet to prevent sliding.Pretty handy option for the price."
3,Spreading it on,The only problems I had with the spreader was maintaining consistency. The feeder holes were either too closed or too open. I burnt up some of the lawn when I stopped and started. The weed and feed made burn marks. The other thing I did not like was the agitator was too small and leaves residue in the spreader. Its going to take some time for me to figure the best way to use the spreader. All in all not bad for the price.
4,AKA The Definite Maybe,"I knew this would happen. Josh Lucas's star goes stratospheric and his obscure early movies would get released on DVD. Some people think this is amateurish and unfunny. I laughed the whole time; see my review under VHS: for The Definite Maybe (which has long been out-of-print). It's a pleasant little diversion, maybe not worth the current price, but hey. If you like Josh Lucas, you'll like this one. For someone who says in interviews that he has no comedic timing, he's a hoot and fairly adept at doing physical contortions and pratfalls."
3,Harry Potter wand,"This is an adequate wand as a prop for an HP costume or for kids playing at wizarding. It lights from the tip when waved to cast a spell, and produces 3 different sounds which cycle in sequence with each wave of the wand. It is battery operated but does not stay lit more than a few seconds, even if you say ""Lumos."" It would be better if it included a switch to keep the light on, particularly when creeping about Hogwarts after dark. And I wasn't able to produce a decent patronus with it, despite my best efforts. With the light and the sound, it is superior to merely waving a stick around, and it's reasonably priced through this vendor."
3,Good but..,"This, 'Mark Hitchcock' book didn't grab me like his last four did. The geographical details are confusing and uneccesary. Maps, charts should've been included."
1,false advertising: DOES NOT include elastic sports band as claimed!,"I am so disappointed! The product description here on Amazon, as well as the description on the back of the DVD case, claims product includes the sports band you need. WRONG! Now I have to hunt down one, wherever they sell the things, just to do the workout that uses it, when it was supposed to be included -- one of the reasons I ordered this instead of another product. I am so mad!"
4,"Good, but understand it for what it is: the basics.","This book contains a lot of the basics, from our founding documents to important speeches. It serves as a compact quick reference for folks who are already familiar with American history. Anyone new to that history will have a hard time understanding the context of the contents of this book."
1,Useless- Do not buy!,"Definitely qualifies for the Top Ten Worst Products of 2005. Not only did Griffin push the shipping date back every month from January to December, when they finally did ship it, it didn't work.You can just imagine their thinking, ""Well, it doesn't really work, but the idea is fantastic. We'll sell enough before people catch on. Meanwhile, we'll make enough profit in restocking fees for this piece of cheap plastic garbage."""
1,yet another warning to potential buyers,"While adding another ""do not, do not, do not buy this thing"" is redundant, it should be immediately clear to anyone thinking this device works as advertised that it obviously does not. I purchased this and returned it within two hours after trying it for my commute. While it was attached to my iPod, the backlight stayed on which at first I thought was a weird feature, but then it it would go off for couple seconds and jump right back on. Occaisionally tracks would skip for no apparent reason. Using FF and Rev on my car's cassette deck worked exactly once.This is a great idea for the iPod, I only wished that Griffin hadn't rushed it out without really testing it."
1,Doesn't work in Prius or w/3Gen iPod,"A great idea, and I love Griffin's iTrip, but when I finally got my SmartDeck yesterday and popped it in expectently, My casette deck fast-forwarded, stopped, fast-forwarded, stopped, and spat it out. Going to Griffin Technology's support page and digging a bit, I found this:SmartDeck SupportWhy isn't it working in my car?We went to great lengths to make the SmartDeck compatible with as many cassette players as possible, including factory and after market decks. Unfortunately, there are cassette players that will not work with the SmartDeck. If your SmartDeck is not working in your cassette player, please try it in another cassette player before contacting us. If the SmartDeck works in other cassette players, you may have a player that is not compatible.(...)So be forewarned. It might be a great product, but in my 2005 Prius, it's just a paperweight."
1,Does Not Work - Will Not Fit New Ipod Video,"The plug on this adapter is designed to fit an older Ipod - IT WILL NOT FIT NEW IPOD WITH VIDEO.I tried the adapter in my car (2005 Prius), the deck would eject the adapter every timeReturned"
1,Not Good For Toyota Highlander,"Eagerly awaited the arrival of the SmartDeck - especially with the intelligent controls.However, huge disappointment awaited when the tape deck (6-cd changer model) in my 2003 Toyota Highlander Limited couldn't recognize it.I will try in my Saturn SL2 and write another review (or modify this)... it might just be a faulty unit....This review form is thinking this product is a computer game??"
3,Not worth the time,This book was not helpful to me studying for Step 1. It contains too much unnecessary detail while it lacks clinically relevant information. 1st aid was sufficient + Lippincott for its nice charts.
2,"Low yield, very dense book","I had the misfortune of not taking medical school biochemistry in my first year, so I attempted to cram all of biochemistry in a few days using this book. The books was incredibly dense, went into the pathways in incredible detail, and was not particularly helpful for highlighting the important concepts tested on USMLE Step I. I would definitely use another book for Step I review, but I might use this if I had to take a rigorous biochemistry course."
5,Little unit works well,"I have had good success with the Coby brand. I realize there may be a few limitations (as noted in the other reviews), but the DVD player does everything I want it to do and is a great value for the money. The video quality is better than I thought it might be. It saved me from being bored at the in-laws (which is probably analogous to keeping the toddler from being bored during long trips in the car.)"
4,Fantastic for the price,This portable DVD player is fantastic. It plays whatever you throw at it and the best part is I can carry 5 movies in one 4 gig thumb drive without having to carry along a stack of DVD's. The battery life is not too great at only about 4 hours but you can't beat that for the price of this player. It comes with all the needed accessories.My only complaint is the case is made of lightweight plastic but you can't expect everything for the price I paid. I did get the extended warranty for only about $12.00 so In case it does break easily i am covered. The screen size for me is perfect and I can actually enjoy the movie with out having to lug around a large player (for that I would just use my laptop) I highly recommend this player
5,Best For the Cost of the Product,"Excellent Portable player where you can play your items from External Hard Drive (western Digital or any External hard drive) USB Drives,DVD,DC,DIVX ... what else it plays everything.. i have bought 2 Coby product and both of them are excellent.. it will play everything...Also can be used as Digital photo frame ... Enjoy it .."
2,Bad product,"I bought this DVD player for the travel, however, when I got this product, it did not work properly. Screen was just black although I could listen to the sound from this player. Since then, I don't believe Coby brand."
4,So Far so Good,"I use this on a boat where there is a lot of vibration, no problems after about 80 hours of use"
4,Great player,"I have been using this player for only couple of months, but I think it is a great player. Having options of memory card and USB is a really plus. It was great to have this player on my long drive. The only drawback I thought was that once folded to fit in to car pouch the controls are not available. You will have to carry remote control on your trips. If you are ok with that then you will really like this player."
3,It's okay...,"This product was a gift to my son for his birthday. We've taken it on several car trips, and it's very handy to keep him busy. However, after a few uses, it has gotten very touchy with playing DVDs. You have to be EXTREMELY careful when handling the player when a movie is playing or it is almost like it shuts off and turns back on - and then you have to go through all the previews and find your spot back. It's very annoying especially when it does this repeatedly as you are trying to put it in the holder. It seems it is sensitive to the slightest pressure on or near the DVD door. I've had it reset when pushing the buttons on the right. Other than that, it has good quality sound and picture. Not sure if I would be too happy if I had spent my own money on it."
2,"DVD doesn't work, but USB works on mine","Screen protector was peeled off on one corner. I had hard time taking it off completely.Mine didn't play DVD media correctly. It's like stop and go continuously, making unable to watch any video. It plays Divx files from USB memory though.It reads USB memory card, but you have to select USB each time the unit is turned on. It plays picture files automatically when you select USB. So when power is off and on, you will have to go through several steps to watch Video files in USB memory."
2,No crumbs along the way?,"I was disappointed in this book. I bought it after reading the reviews. But I must say I found it predictable from the very start. You knew right off the bat that it's a Donovan series, so of course beloved Kyle is going to turn up after all.But what bugged me most was the childish style of the novel and the way it wrapped up in about 5 pages at the end after a rather tedious journey thrugh fishing details. Ugh. The Amber aspect was enough to pique one's imagination, and that's about where the interest stopped for me. The heroine is of course tough yet tender, cliched ever-so-talented gal artist in a wealthy family of strong cliched men."
5,The first but not the last,"This is the first of the series. I've listened to this series many times and enjoy it more and more each time. The plot is great and the characters are colorful and well developed. When you finish one you can't wait to get the next one. I especially like the way characters from pervious books make appearances in subsequent books. This seems to be an original trait of Elizabeth Lowell's and one that makes this series easy to listen to over and over again. I listen to many suspense/mystery/romance series, but this one is without any doubt my absolute favorite."
1,UGH!,"The dialogue is so full of cliches, I struggled to make it through this one. As other reviewers have stated, the amber story line was hard to follow, and the characters were so un-realistic. What was supposed to have been clever banter between our hero and heroine left me feeling embarrassed for an author who has such a pathetic perception of wit. I bought this and the sequel on the same day, so I tried Jade . . . something or other . . . next. SAME REACTION! Same characters, new names. Same dialogue, absence of wit. BIG disappointment times two."
3,she's just to slow!,Elizabeth Lowell is the best when it comes to writing romances but I didn't like the way she wright's trillers. the story is good not unrealistic a lot but it seems that the romance in it slows it down too much. I don't know but this triller comes out as a very slow romantic story. you simply don't even feel the suspence!
5,Great hat for Super Mario costume.,This hat worked out great for my Halloween costume once I sewed on a white M onto it.
3,Serves The purpose,"This was the only soffit vent that I could find, so I have nothing to compare it with. I would recommend super gluing the thing together after you get your hole cut in the soffit, because it will likely come apart when you tug on the vent pipe to take up the slack. Other than that, it is functional, serves the purpose, and is reasonably priced."
3,Review by Patricia's Particularity,"With unique images and a story of bravery and strength, readers are treated to one of the most important women in history: Rosa Parks. Rosa's Story is universally known, refusing to give up her seat on the bus. Little did Rosa Parks know she would go from being a seamstress to a timeless figure of history. By standing up for what she believed in and what is right, Rosa finds strengths and courage, giving all those around her the same.Bryan Collier's images are nothing like any other. Using a patchwork style, there is something wholesome about each images, with rich colors and multidimensional effects. For those looking to inspire children with courage and inner strength, this is a wonderful book to add to any collection."
1,Worst Trash Bags Ever,I stupidy bought a box of these from Office Depot. I thought it would save some money. What a waste. These bags rip everytime you use them. They are so thin putting two together does not make them any stronger. Stick to the name brand bags.
4,Great 3CCD camcorder when using Adobe Premiere Pro,"I use my VDR-D250 to shoot in-house product reviews and commercials. The 3CCD allows me to create green screen backdrops and provides a quality picture. The built-in microphone is sensitive enough to pickup a lot of ambient noises (which is great if you want to capture party conversations), but I've attached a boom microphone when needing directional audio with wind screen protection.Easy to use controls helps a lot, too.Getting the video off of the DVD-R discs media format (.VOP) requires conversion by external editing software. After trying Vegas and other software without luck, I had success with Adobe Premiere Pro CS3.Overall, I really like this camera."
1,Oraibi Oaqol Ceremony; Oraibi Natal Customs and Ceremonies; Oraibi Marau Ceremony,Warning! This book is a reprint. I purchased it for research purposes and all prints and pictures in the book are unidiscernable! Don't waste your money!
3,Average 80s pop with one hidden gem.,"This otherwise rather mundane 80s pop album is lifted up to 3-star level by the presence of the amazing ""Heart to Heart"", one of the greatest, and most undeservedly-forgotten, pop singles of the 1980s. Loggins' impressive voice finally is given some material worthy of it with this tune, and the performance is extremely memorable. The live duet with Steve Perry is also listenable, as is ""Welcome to Heartlight"". Pleasant 80s pop with one shining moment on track 6. :-)"
5,Wonderful!,"My infant son has very sensitive, dry and scaley skin. I started using this cream and it is nothing short of wonderful. I put it on his body after a bath and I also put some on his legs and arms on non-bath days. The eucerin creme has made a huge difference for us. I highly recommend this product."
5,Power of the dog,"Loved it, my favorite of any of the Winslow books that I have read, the length of the book was a tad long but I enjoyed the book so much I did not want it to end."
3,True?,I found the first parts disconnected but the second half did get the story together. I wonder if this is not more truth than fiction. I'm glad I read the entire story.
4,powerful message,"Strong film with powerful message. Alcohol and Addiction groups thoroughly enjoy the film and it facilitates many discussion topics in alcohol and addiction groups, from addiction and addictive behavior to HIV/AIDS, and at risk groups for both."
5,Excellent and accurate P-51D offering,"The BBI P-51D ""Killer"" is excellent. By that I mean that the detail, paint scheme, overall accuracy, crisp paint demarcations, stencils in the proper areas/panels, and downright beauty of the P-51D itself, make this BBI airplane ""kit"" an excellent collector item and educational tool.It seems that the aircraft which BBI produces are wonderful...I cannot speak for the Armor and Infantry offerings since airplanes are my passion, but if it comes from BBI, chances are it WILL be excellent.Thank you for reading this short assessment,Jim FowlerFlorida"
3,Who Are Those Guys?,(...)I felt compelled to read The Tao of Design because I am awaiting a new way to think and process design theory. I think Mr. Garant may offer that possibility. (...)I was pleasantly challenged and would recommend this book to anyone who is ready to challenge the way they think about design.
1,So confusing!,"I registered for this b/c it was cheaper than the Baby Bjorn... well, you get what you pay for! This carrier is so confusing! Too many straps and I felt that they loosened up quickly. I never used it, so I took it back. I ended up getting the Baby Bjorn Active carrier as reccomended by my mom friends. I use my Baby Bjorn ALL THE TIME now!"
5,Daddy Approved!,"We made a special trip to Babies R Us to try on baby carriers. My husband tried all of them (since he primarily uses it). For him, this carrier was the most comfortable. He found that it gave more back support than the Baby Bjorn or any of the other carriers. Neither of us find the carrier to be too challenging to put on. The straps have stayed snug, and our little guy is comfortable facing forward or backward.Advice: Try on carriers before you buy! Pick the one that is most comfortable for you!"
5,The Velveteen Rabbit Gift Set,The gift set was lovely and I know the person I am giving it to will enjoy this very much.
5,worth it,This DVD is worth it simply for the skateboard sequence... There but for the grace of God go we...
1,Disgusting,"The CD case and disc itself is disgusting. Dirty, smudged and full of fingerprints as well as scratches on the CD. Very scuffed and soiled. I do a ton of shopping on amazon.com and this was my first and by far biggest disappoinment."
3,Iffy,"Long on dialogue and short on narrative, Turtledove's style leaves much to be desired. In the end, this book is relegated to the category of ""great idea, weak story"" in which so many alternate history/science fiction novels find themselves. However, Turtledove's obvious love of history makes the characters of the novel memorable and endearing. A student of the Civil War will thoroughly enjoy this novel, but the lay reader will struggle with the historical ironies at the heart of the story."
2,A disappointment.,"Oh man, is this Turtledove guy a nerd!OK OK OK, hang on just a minute. I wrote a college thesis on the subject of the Confederacywinning the war alright, so its not that I object to the concept of our boys being armed withAK-47's, but I do object to the dull and lifeless portrayal by this Turtledove clown. Its noteven worth the words, this book is so immensely and insanely boring you'd have to be crazy tothink this passes for decent fiction, or science fiction for what its worth. You could take thisentire ridiculous story and capsulize it to a single episode of Star Trek, maybe Captain Kirkcan add some much needed humor to this thing."
2,Convoluted and confusing,"This book is not the best as a textbook. Might be useful as a refresher or reference, but that's not what I had to use it for. It is wordy and is sometimes too detailed and sometimes not enough. It has no consistency, thanks to numerous authors. Also, the material is often outdated. Time to look for a different book."
3,Michelle Reis and Tony in a medical drama,"Jackie(Michelle) is a recently-awakened coma patient that was loved by a doctor named Kenny Bee while she was in coma. But Michelle shows affection toward the emotionally scarred doctor, Lawrence(Tony Leung)The actors look good and all but the story and direction are nothing new. and what's with Valerie Chow and Stephen Fung??"
4,cute and soft guinea pig,very nice soft and looks just as described in picture my granddaughter loved it.we are very satisfied with this cute little animal
3,"Sport Armband .... fine...unless you have ""big guns""","Product works fine as advertised and is perfect as long as your biceps are medium to small. 14"" armband is too small for me...measure your arms before you buy...otherwise it's fine"
3,If you are sensitive to scents . . .,". . . this smells very odd, almost as though animal products had been used and the processing hadn't been completed. After developing headaches 3X from using this product, I threw it out.That said, it is washes fine, but so do Neutrogena products."
3,"Good, but like nylon loops better...","A good product, I have had mine for years. But I decided to replace them thanks to a new camera (and a much more crowded camera bag than before).Why?The hard rubber connectors that attach to the camera are not flexible. During use this is not a problem, but when it comes time to store or rest the camera on a surface (due to the strap being connected to the vertical grip), the hard rubber doesn't flex enough to allow the straps to be moved out of the way of the camera, or other items within a confined area.If you not picky about function, these are great items - but if you are (like me), buy the ones with nylon loops instead."
5,Bestseller for sure!!!,"Narrating the dreadful events from the vantage point of a child and making them sound so incredibly interesting it's a feat by itself. The author had my attention immediately and made me yearn for more. I had to finish it all in one reading and yet I did not want it to end. All the stories are superb.I wish people in power,along with those who get satisfaction in creating turmoil through wars, would wake up and find other means of peaceful coexistence!!!.Ms. Psyhogeos, presents her case eloquently and kudos are in order!!!"
3,A regift item,Its ok. I will have to be really bored to finish watching the rest of the the the dvd.
4,Retro Look at Psychobilly Pioneers,"This best of gives you everything you're looking for from the Meteors, who, like The Cramps, put swamp rock psychobilly heaven on the map. This overview includes some of their best singles, including the crowd pleasing, foot stomping punky tinged ""Mutant Rock."" Although they are not nearly as adept at providing the familiar blues infused romp like their American counterparts, this IS the best from over the pond, and their b-movie horror flick tinged lyrics confirm it. A must for any serious collection."
3,Baryshnikov Dances Sinatra and More: A Dance Creation by Twyla TharpMikhail Baryshnikov,Really overpriced for what is offered. The Sinatra track is the really the only one worth watching. Baryshnikov is not interesting when talking. He's sheer magic when dancing.
3,Decent,"Well it did give me a lot of ideas for approaching women. I found it to be in general worthwhile. It was better than the stuff I learned from MysteryThe Mystery Method: How to Get Beautiful Women Into Bedand from Neil StraussThe Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artistsbut I got a much better understanding of approaching women from Mr. L. Rx's stuffDating To Relating - From A To Z: (A Man's Guide To Understanding Women)It was way more natural.All and all however, I found this was worth getting as it gave me a lot of ideas in combination with the other books I read."
5,THE NYLON CURTAIN IS BILLY JOEL'S BEST MUSIC ALBUMS EVER!,"I recommend any of the piano man and the voice from any Billy Joel CD albums out there. My favorite songs on here are ""Allentown"", ""Pressure"" and ""A Room of Our Own"" is the classic BJ tunes of rock'n roll!"
5,Billy Joel's Most Somber Album,"If ""Glass Houses"" was Joel's homage to New Wave Rock and Roll, then ""The Nylon Curtain"" pays tribute to The Beatles. The ballad ""Laura"" sounds like a John Lennon song, and ""Scandinavian Skies"" certainly conjurs up thoughts of ""Sargent Pepper"" or ""Yellow Submarine"". But it is also Beatlesque in the sense that Joel's tone is substantially a lot more serious on this album, than his earlier works, covering a vast range of social issues from the plight of Vietnam veterans (""Goodnight, Saigon"") to the plight of coal miners (""Allentown"") to the pressures of daily life (""Pressure""). This is undoubtedly one of Joel's finest albums."
5,Billy Joel's peak is right here,Billy's career and songwriting peak is here...Contains these 4 pocket symphonies by Billy Joel that are timeless.Laura - Possibly Billy's best song everGoodnight Saigon - Still a live favoriteA Room Of Our Own - UnderratedScandinavian Skies - Another forgotten classic
3,Vacuum Filter,"The product I ordered was the wrong fit for my vacuum. The vendor was helpful with my return and has provided contact information for the return. I sent the product back, but I am waiting for a response from the vendor."
1,Boring autobiography + Too arty for my taste,"European movie directors think that the whole world would like to know how they got into the cinema, and this is another of the countless ""portrait of the artist as a young man"". It's slightly interesting in its evocation of the collapse of France in 1940 but for the most part it's not about the occupation but about how the boy got interested in photography of models (as a step toward ""real"" cinema). The movie is, to me, quite boring and it is also marred by ""arty"" tricks such as switching from story to musical, from black and white to color, and so on."
4,No English subtitles for the ITFML Making of DVD!,"I'd give both films 5 stars, but I'd subtract one for this product. I'm a huge fan of Wong Kar-Wai's films, and when I went to Hong Kong last weekend I really sought this item out, having seen it on HMV's website. I was very pleased with the four ITMFL and the other four 2046 bookmarks that were included. My only disappointment with this product is that no English subtitles are available in the Making of ITMFL/Deleted scenes DVD, whereas in the 2046 Making of DVD, they were included. Nonetheless, I still think this is a worthy buy for any big fan of Wong Kar-Wai's films, though the ITMFL Criterion Collection version seems to offer better features."
3,Fond memories,I remember watching this movie when I was a kid. It was really funny with a cute side to it. I definately reccomend watching it if you think you've already seen every good comedy movie out there. It is a definate must see.
3,Heavy garlic,"Although highly rated by experts, too much garlic smell for my taste. Going back to Shark brand after 4 bottles of this.Notes:1. Smaller bottle than most; may be convenient at table.2. Like some other good imported brands, no chemical preservatives. US Huy Fong has chemicals, probably because it' s left out all day on restaurant tables.3. Top is weak--hinge broke off before fully used.4. After #3 top very hard to put back on."
4,Different World,The different world of Michael Harrington is worth visiting. We get insight into socialist thought. Harrington's thoughts about class warfare and poverty are most interesting. Some of his ideas on economics are wrong.He certainly brings some serious logical arguments to the table in many areas!
4,"Good Book, Wrong Audience","The Mirrorstone would have done better as a young-adult novel. I read it when I was 10 and found the story a bit hard to follow, while 8-year-olds had trouble reading the first two pages. The illustrations are spectacular; richly detailed, sophisticated, and obviously well-researched by the illustrator. But I'm not sure if it's worth the effort, because children's books like these aren't going to sell in large numbers. The revenue from the book would never compensate the artist's efforts.If this book were extended and published as a novel, I can see it reaching a wider audience. It's an adventure story about a kid who's brought back in time by an evil magician, based on his ability to swim. This kind of yarn would be a favorite with the Harry Potter crowd, not with grade-schoolers.Unfortunately, today's kids will probably never see this book at all."
5,PSP Super Travel Case With Pockets,PSP Super Travel Case With Pockets excellent case to carry your PSP3000 everywhere I think it is very practical and caring for your team falls
4,Nice case but the metal rivet is the problem,I ordered this case and saw the other reviews stating that the rivet was a problem but I was thinking that the maker would have fixed the issue by now. When I got the case I opened it to notice that the rivet was still visible you would think that they could have easily put a felt pad over it. The reason this is needed is because after awhile the rivet will rub on the PSP and cause marks on the back. I have the Piano Black PSP and it looks brand new if I put it in this case without covering the rivet it will damage the PSP. Other then that I really like the case I'll just have to fix this problem first before I really use it a problem I shouldn't have to fix in the first place.
4,Nice,This is a very good little case and with the carabiner it makes for a handy way to transport a PSP. It has extra storage for games and accessories as well.
2,fair deal,great deal for the price only issue is the button for the clip it can scratch the psp but i put and eye class cleaner to help protect it the clip it comes with is cheap and not durable at all it feels like its made from plastic but it does the job its supposed to maybe i'm just nit picky
1,Stay away,This product is completly useless seeing it can only hold 2 games the other holding area will not hold anything without it falling out and the spot that holds the psp is also useless seeing the strap that holds it in place attaches to nowhere but a tiny piece of velcro that wont even grab anything stay away
1,allexx46,PSP Go Super Travel EVA Case with PocketsI read the negative review of how small this case is and did not believe it. OMG what a mistake. After cutting out all the pockets and fillers my PSP 3000 finally fit without the zipper separating. It was cheap so I might just toss it but I found a USB power cord that works so I do not have to pack the charger. But for sure if I can find a case that can hold the cord I will get that case and toss this one. There is no room in this case for anything but the 3000 and that is not true unless you cut out the insert that is supposed to hold your games. LOL what a false hope for this case. I hope they fired the engineer that designed this!
2,Dissapointed,"The case is ok, but I was very dissapointed to find out that this case is NOT made of Genuine leather at all. It's hard ""leather-look"" plastic. Please update the discription. Thank you."
4,Perfect Fit for PSP 3000 and Great Price,"Before purchasing 2 of these PSP Super Travel Case with Pockets, I read through almost 100 reviews on other products. This case is perfect for my 8 & 7 yr old boys PSPs. The travel case is somewhat hard on the outside, definitely protecting it from most damage that could happen (except if it was stepped on). The pocket on the inside top holds games and earphones. Other reviews talk about the metal attachment that would rub against the PSP, I saw that and it hasn't left any marks yet. We just put a folded paper towel to add a cushion of protection. I also purchased on Amazon ""2 of BLACK Soft Rubber Jelly Silicone Skin Cover Case for Sony Play Station Portable PSP 3000. CrazyOnDigital Retail Package"" to go along with the PSP, these are perfect for keeping it clean from sticky hands. Hope this helps!"
3,"Solid, durable but not ideal","Material seems to be very solid so protective function might be well achieved.There are two very annoying things:1. In the PSP compartment there is a rivet's head that will surely scratch your psp if not in the protective cover - BEWARE.2. There are small pouches to store memory or mini headsets. However they are so loose, that each time I open the case, I need to be very careful, not to drop my cards or so.If these things could be improved I would give this product 5 stars..."
1,BEWARE!!!,"Broke on the first take off which did not even make it in the air. Also, when we recieve the package and looked on the back of the box there was a warning that product contained a chemical that may cause cancer, so you need to make sure that if you buy this product wash hands and keep childrens hands out there mouth. Not a product I would recommend for a child."
1,Beautiful but silent and WAY overpriced,"I love the appearance of my kettle, and it boils water well with its heavy bottom.Unfortunately, it is virtually silent. The harmonica whistle needs to be adjusted constantly & generally doesn't work. Sure, it's an easy fix, but this is a TEA KETTLE, not a Ferrari. At this price, it shouldn't need maintenance every time I use it!Look elsewhere!"
3,"Solid Product, not exactly ""tuneful""","Didn't love this. My biggest problem was that the whistle was not exactly what I'd call ""tuneful"". I think this teakettle may actually be able to wake the dead, but I donated it to Goodwill without checking out this feature. Bottom line: large, well constructed, looks nice, but LOUD!"
2,Only one reason to watch this movie...,"And that is to gaze upon the loveliness of Shu Qi. This movie features some of the most inept film-making I've seen in a HK movie. And that is really saying something. The opening scenes in particularly are garishly lit, ugly, and amateurish. Much of the movie seems barely scripted. A waste of some good young talent."
3,traditional ragas,"i bought this cd to play while giving massage. i like it for it's simplicity. it is a full hour plus. the drumming doesn't start until about 18 minutes into the tracks, which is disappointing to me because i love indian drumming. i recommend it for meditation, massage, yoga and enjoyment."
3,Another album that is just plain fun,"There is just something infinitely appealing about a heavy-metal swing band. The big crescendos and fast rhythms typical of swing are so well blended with the metal grind guitar by this band it's hard not to love it. The combination is really just plain fun to listen too; then why only three stars? Unfortunately, I heard their most recent release first. It really shows what this band is capable of and takes metal swing to a whole new, five star level. This album is good and worth the purchase price, but not nearly as good as ""Sing-Along Songs for the Damned and Delirious"" which is why I gave this three stars."
4,Was it worth it?,"My portfolio came in right on time in a very large box which was slightly bent. Inside it was my black portfolio which was permanently bent due to the bending of the box. The portfolio looked much better in the picture, however it is what i need for school so i guess it's alright, Description states it's water resistant, but we'll have to see about that.Overall, a great product but I had higher expectations."
3,HMMM a bit of a Love - Hate,"HMMMM a bit of a love-hate.Love the concept, love how elsewhere was developed loved some of the characters.Liz frustrated me, The story line felt Gappy in some places like I really wanted more to happen- or more info.The ending was kind of a fizzle to me to.I still enjoyed the story, just was expecting a little bit more."
4,The protagonist in spite of herself,"Ms. Zevin came up with a great idea - aging backwards after death until one reincarnates as a baby. Elsewhere itself, as a setting, worked quite well for me. The supporting characters were fine. Liz herself ...After a while I was rooting for her grandmother, Betty, to throw her out! Until her visit to The Well, she came across as incredibly whiny and self-centered. The book improves substantially after that. I'm not a dog person, so the canine dialogue didn't do much for me; Owen's dog, Jen, seemed obnoxious.Overall though, the plot does come together nicely, with Liz maturing as she gets younger."
4,Good teen read but lacks something,"As others have written, Elsewhere is a wonderful book for young teens. It follows the life and death of Elizabeth Hall, a 15-year-old who finds herself in the afterlife after a fatal bike accident. Zevin is marvelous and creative, constructing a ""death"" that bears a strong resemblance to life on Earth. Her interpretation of reincarnation is very interesting and thought-provoking.My only criticism of the book would be the expression of emotions and character development. Many of the characters seemed to lack a unique personality, and their dialogue was sometimes dry. I wish the book might have been a bit longer, and provided further details. Overall, however, it was a pleasant read."
2,Not well written... fell short. But not horrible,"My biggest issue with this book was the tone. It made it very difficult to read or take seriously. There were some great and cute ideas in it (although I personally extremely dislike the idea of reincarnation because I'd hate to forget this life)... it just fell short in a few ways... there were a few great ""quotable"" lines but it felt so out of place and strange.I wouldn't recommend paying money for this book (I checked it out at a library) and I probably won't read anything else by this author. I used to want to but no longer have that desire. Great, great ideas but not played out well. She needs to work on her tone as an author."
5,LOVED IT!,This book is my most favorite book that i have EVER read. It has a great start that makes you just not want to stop reading it! Liz is killed and doesn't believe she's dead. until she sees her funeral. The ending is the best part! I cryed it was so good. I really hope you read this book. It's one of the best books i have ever read in my life.
2,"Captivating, But Depressing","The book kept me curious and engaged...and sad. If you like happy endings, then you might want to think twice before reading this one."
2,"Interesting start, but...","At first, I was intrigued by this idea of a heaven where one ages backwards and then is reincarnated. The characters started it off likeable enough, but then it became dull. As one poster already said, I would have liked more actions. I got to the middle of the book, and became disappointed with where the storyline was going. This book was average at best.If you'd like to read some intriguing work, I highly reccomend reading The Giver."
1,Item made me feel scammed....,"Product Description From the Manufacturer:Chemistry is an award winning kit that comes with a 40 page highly visual, step-by- step instruction book. All the materials are included your child will need to perform 35 experiments.--------->But 'Inside the Book' on the inside of the front cover is a list of stuff that needs to be bought from the store if you want to do all the experiments.Examples: Cooking oil for a ""mixing oil and water?"" experiment ( pgs 16 & 17 )floating with density experiment (pgs. 18 & 19) eggs, and salt... and many others.When a manufacturer claims -ALL- materials are included, They should provide all materials. There is a half page long SHOPPING LIST of additional materails you will need to buy or find from around the house."
4,great for at-home practice and as a teaching tool.,"i think these cards are great. as someone who has been practicing yoga for over twenty years, there are still times when i find it difficult to get myself inspired. with these cards, you can pick just one, or do all of them or any combination therein. the meditations and breathing exercises are really nice, too."
1,Forget it!!!!!,"Do not order this item. Picture is totally misconceiving. Looks a lot better than it is. The SHEET is as thin as paper and did NOT even fit the mattress. I would send it back, but it's just too much trouble."
1,doesn't match the online description,"I ordered this book in paperback form, as its over $200 cheaper than the hard bound and is described as having the same content as the other version. When I received this book, however, it only went to page 715 while the description states it was over 1000 pages. I don't quite know what happened to the other 300 pages, but I am hoping that they were unimportant for the class. My recommendation- buy this book from the publisher. Only then will you know that you got the proper book that you ordered."
3,Impressed with Debut Album,"Bearing in mind that this is Joe Kraemer's Debut Album (as Singer / Songwriter), I was fairly impressed with this effort. Before I bought the record I read a review with Kraemer, where he stated his musical influences as Billy Joel, Paul Simon etc. and I think these are prominent in his style (especially Simon).The Record is a collection of acoustic songs with quite a fresh sound, none of which will blow you away, but nevertheless are very solid making this debut, a very easy and enjoyable listen.The songs that stand out include 'Hypothermia' and 'Afternoon Falls into Night' - the latter being my favourite song on the album, with it's quite brilliant acoustic sound and great lyrics to match.I would recommend this album to everybody that enjoys the talents of singer/songwriters, and with this being a solid debut, I'm sure we'll be hearing a lot more about Kraemer in the future."
4,continuous play,"I picked up this album because I was one of the few people who saw ""The Way of the Gun"" and liked it. I was curious to hear Joe Kraemer's own music, outside of a film score. I have not been disappointed. I just realized, that while working at the computer, I had listened to it four times through and never tired of it."
2,Out of patience,"This movie might be all right if you're 12 years old, otherwise, skip this one.The one positive, is that it is a clean, family film, that is why it got 2 stars instead of 1."
3,Bought it for America but stayed for the rest,"A pretty good CD, I originally got it because I wanted a copy of America, which is truly a great song, but as I continued to listen I realized that I also liked many of the other songs. Of course now I have to go get Vol. 1 so I can get Sweet Caroline and all those great hits as well. I remember many of these songs as my mom used to play them to me on an old 8-track and it surprised how many of them I still knew."
3,Boards and wards,Boards and wards is a decent short concise reference when doing clinical rotations.The book can be difficult at times because it is so shortOverall it's not a bad book to carry in ur whitecoat while ur medicine rotation
2,not very organized ... lacks crucial information,"While this book might appeal to the reader becuase of its size ( around 300 pages ), I found that it can be more organized. The information is not presented in the best way for Neither Step 2 nor Step 3.Although it has some nice chapters ( radiology ), it is lacking detailed information about crucial subjects ( sexually transmitted diseases, although mentioned in a table , it is not presented in a suitable fashion for the USMLEs, the psychiatry is not very organized either ) .This book is an average book, and you are better off with other books ( crush the boards, Swansons ..etc)"
2,Rare & odd,"So far as I know, this is the only printing. Joyce, an Irish immigrant, Civil War ""colonel"" from Kentucky (actual military rank of Adjutant), minor crony of the Grant years and self-styled ""Poet of Washington"", wrote Poe's first biography (Neely, 1901), ""Burns"" (Regan, Chicago, 1910), and ""Shakspere: Personal Recollections (spelling sic; Broadway, NY, 1904), in addition to volumes of his own poetry. Joyce's works are of interest primarily because he reflects the hypermoralistic outlook of the period after the Civil War. Not a valuable work for study of Burns. However, his autobiographical ""A Checkered Life"" (if you can find it) is of value because it describes in some detail his experiences as an asylum inmate, as well as his involvement in the Whiskey Ring scandals, for which he served time. I believe the Library of Congress and the University of Kentucky have copies of these works."
3,Mounting hardware not included!,"The supports are great, but be prepared to search multiple hardware stores to find the bolts needed to attach them. You need to get stainless socket cap screws to mount them. The heads are recessed into the support holes and the stock bolts will not fit and they will be too short. I found what I needed at Ace Hardware, none of the big box stores had them. The correct bolts should have been supplied with the supports!"
1,Stay away from this product!,"I purchased the True Cermaic the first time back in 2009 and I loved it for about 2 months and then it died on me. It made my hair so smooth and I was very upset that is just stopped working. I was very happy to see it listed in 2012 on amazon, so I decided to order it.... and guess what?? It lasted about 2 months and then just stopped working. At that time I purchased a different brand and that one is still going strong. The company that makes this item is ""out of business"" and I guess people are still trying to unload theirs.... I wasted about 140.00 on this product... STAY AWAY!!!"
3,disappointed,"buy this product 4 months ago , and the truth is delighted was worked very well until suddenly the part of the ceramic has started to take off that worries me because it can damage my hair"
3,good for a used game,the game played fine despite the had minor scratches along the bottom. however the sounds stop every so often and it sometimes freezes at the final battle for street mode. but some minor problems should be expected having bought it used
4,Great support pillow for 5/6 month olds,"Great pillow for a 5/6 month old to sit in. Great to lay infants down on and once they can sit up some they can sit there with bouncing their head off the hard floor, but once our kids became slightly mobile, this pillow as never used."
5,"Very handy, good value, tight seal","I love these Clip-n-Seal Bag Clips. They work great for sealing bags of chips, coffee beans, bags of lettuce, bags of vegetables, bags of flax seeds, etc. I bought the ""medium"" size ones and cut a few in half, which works perfectly for things like bags of coffee beans. I like having a bunch of these around rather than the typical spring-type clip which I had used previously. One thing to be aware of is that it can take a bit of force to un-clip some bags, especially thicker ones, and while not exactly difficult, it can take some effort (I learned this while un-fastening a bag of coffee and accidentally knocked a glass off the counter when my hand suddenly released -- lesson learned). I'll probably buy another batch just to have a few more around because they are quite handy."
1,"""Misguided in Minerva""","With a title called ""Fencer of Minerva"", would you expect at least a few quality sword fight scenes? Yes! Would you also expect there to be a splash of humour that is characteristic of most anime? Probably. Did ""Fencer Of Minerva"" prvode anything worth watching? Maybe if you like hentai.To be completely honest, I feel this is the first anime that wasted my time, because I didn't feel entertained while watching it. I am a huge fan of anime like ""Cowboy Bebop"", ""Martian Successor Nadesico"" and ""Trigun"". Even with the less popular ""Lost Universe"" series, I was at least able to laugh with it.The one thing that I will NOT take away from this DVD title is the quality of the animation that is presented. Clean from beginning to end, and perfect quality too. Great transfer, and props go to Central Park Media for it.No matter how good the video and audio are, I honestly don't think this is worthy in any anime collection. That is, unless it's a hentai collection.Reccommended For Ages 16+"
2,Anime thong song video,"Fencer of Minerva: The Tempest is a very disappointing anime. The female characters are slaves or eventually become slaves. They have shackles around their necks and a flimsy top and a g-string to ""cover"" their bottoms. The plot drags and the action is basically missionary. The clothes keep falling of the slaves at the sight of another male, or female in some instances. The characters are not developed or likable. Diana, who is a princess; was strong willed, and a great swordsman. She also had to put on her thong for Master Sho, and become his personal slave (oh joy). (sniff, sniff) I own Vol 1 and 2 of this series. You have been warned."
4,Thought provoking movie with a message,"Running Inside Out was a thoughtful and thought provoking movie about a woman struggling to find herself, while she's faced with a difficult, life altering decision regarding an unplanned pregnancy. The characters were well drawn and the acting well done, bringing this story to life, while the main character grappled with an intense dilemma. Consider watching this movie if you like well drawn character pieces with a story and a heartfelt message."
4,Wilkins goes christmas,"Great playing on this christmas outing by Jack Wilkins, although sometimes one hears two guitars playing against, instead of with eachother. Best track is in my opninion ""the christmas song"" Most original is the song from a Charles Dickens movie - very nice melody also..."
5,Modern Master,Jack is my favorite of all the modern guitar players. This is a sweet and delicate diversion for Jack into a wonderfully respectful treatment of many Christmas classics. Jack is the modern master.
4,gilligans island,Great wholesome family show. Mt generation grew up on this shows re runs. Jand guys Mary ann not Ginger Marry Ann is super hot!
1,No business writing this book.,"Maid, nanny AND gardener?We're all supposed to take you seriously on the subjects of feminism and stay-at-home moms when your hired help outnumbers your children?"
2,Upper middle class motherhood equals trench wafare???,"Ms. Flanagan's book title echoes Robert Graves' Goodbye To All That, a very moving account of the First World War. For me, her choice of title sums up Ms. Flanagan's self-involvement and self-pity."
2,What's up with Uncle Jack's hair anyway?,"Dad returns home. Will and Holly are stuck in the Land of the Lost. New dinosaurs appear: a fire-breather and a two-headed fork-tongued terror. The kids discover their Uncle Jack is now trapped with them. Sounds like a promising season?Could have been but, unfortunately, wasn't. Stay away from season three. Uncle Jack wasn't very likeable and the quality of the stories (other than maybe Aftershock) was far below the writing in seasons one and two.For the Land of the Lost movie, please have Uncle Jack get crushed by a boulder during the earthquake sequence. Thanks!"
5,An Incredibly Brilliant Recreation of the Political Atmosphere of early 20th Century Italy,"This film is quite amazing. It shows the great tragedy of World War I and how the failure of the masses to back the socialists who called for peace led to the development of fascism. Unforgettable scenes, great cinematography and acting/directing.No cinephile or socialist can afford to miss it."
1,Benito: The Rise and Fall of Mussolini,"If I could give this movie a 0 star I would. This movie has nothing to do with the rise and fall of Mussolini. What it has to do with is the formative years of Mussolini. It does not show how Mussolini morphed the Italian Socialist party into the the Italian Facisit Party, how Mussolini siezed power in Italy, or how Mussolini lost power. What it does show is a Mussolini that beds many women."
3,Should Have Been Titled: The Rise of Mussolini,"I was surprised when the movie ended; it only covered the ""rise"" of Mussolini and not what the title says. I gave it three stars for the superb acting of Antonio Banderas who made the movie interesting, and the movie's portrayal of the early 1900's in Europe. The movie depicted many details about Mussolini's youth, but ended abruptly. It was a little disappointing."
3,The Early Years,"The Movie title is very misleading. This movie covers a short span of Benito Mussolini's life. Starting when he was a schoolteacher at the age of 19. And ending when he gets control of his own daily paper, which occurs during W.W. I. This actually took me by surprise since the movie is over 5 hours long and its title indicates that we will see his entire life. This movie is also dubbed, and not well at that.Now the part of Mussolini's life that is depicted gives us a view of what he was like in his twenties as he gained power in the socialist movement. All you will see is how he maneuvered himself through the political intricacies of this movement in order to gain power, his volatile personality and his womanizing. If you expect to see anything more then this, do not watch this movie.On the positive side, and the reason I gave it three stars, is that the wonderful sets and wardrobe were true to the period. And the acting was well done."
1,Not up to HP's snuff,"This drive was a significant disappointment. Not only will it not burn to any other media besides HP's expensive media, but compatibility issues are a problem. I thought this would be a great way to share some old home videos. In only one of the four DVD players that our family owns would the player read a DVD. All are reasonably priced players bought within the last year.Also, if you're capturing video, forget about using the capture feature in the built-in software. There are only minimal editing abilities provided and the software does a so-so job of detecting incoming video. I own a number of HP products that do an excellent job. This, unfortunately, is not one of them."
1,I Can't believe that HP made this jumk! --- 0 Stars,"You can only read and write from hp dvd 100i, this is not compatibale with any other drive and it will not write or read dvd-r. I tried 3 different rw disk and they are not fully compatibale with the drive either! Bottom line is ""This is not a reliable drive!!!!"""
4,Christmas nostalgia,"I bought this mp3 album because I used to listen to my parents' record of this album when I was a kid, and I cried sappy tears of nostalgia when I saw it was available for download. It's not modern instrumentation, so if you are looking for something modern and hip, this is not it. Classic chorus/sing-along style."
5,Holiday Sing Along With Mitch,"This album has been my favorite for over 30 years. When I was in the third grade, my mom bought the album and let me bring it to our school Christmas party. We loved the sheets of lyrics where we could follow along. I've worn the album thin, and would love for my future grandchildren to be able to enjoy it as well. Please, please, please bring it back as a CD."
5,"What can I say, wow.",If you want to feel good. If you want wake up the house. Crank up the volume and sing along with Mitch and his gang.
4,"Nice selections, no overblown orchestrations","I got this CD from Amazon this past Christmas (2010). Mitch passed away in 2010 at age 99. I remember ""Sing Along with Mitch"" on TV when I was a kid. He always did a Christmas show with holiday songs. This CD best represents what one of Mitch's holiday shows was like. Good old fashioned singing with no overblown orchestration. Ironically, Mitch was known for overdubbing and echoing effects on most of Columbia's records in the 50s when he was in charge of that. It's why artists like Frank Sinatra left the label.Back to the CD. 16 songs, most of them standards. They all sound good. One song that got my attention was Must Be Santa, a song that never became a hit. But it's a great novelty song. A nice CD for a sing-along or background music at any holiday party. A book with the lyrics in included, since the ""bouncing ball"" has long been retired (wink)."
4,Great video for Madrid Lovers,"This is a great video to watch for anyone that wants to travel to Madrid, or anyone that has been there. It shows more of the inside spots of Madrid, not just the touristy places. The couple that is in the video is very fun to watch and they help show what it can be like for tourists in Spain. The video also shows Segovia, Toledo, and Seville, so someone who goes to Spain can see the other places nearby that they can travel. I only wish it were longer so it could show more of the places you can go in Madrid."
4,Moving Past Budokon Beginning Practice,"I've been doing the beginning practice for a couple months and like it, but it is not as integrated a workout as the the rest of the DVD's. Flow and Flexibility is a quantum leap past the beginning practice, but it is easier than Power and Agility or Strength and Balance (which is the most challenging). I bought them all not knowing the order they should be attempted. The style of the beginning practice much different and getting the next disc is good to use to practice some of the techniques because the level of core and leg strength needed is higher for the Flow and Flexibility (and the other discs)."
5,Tough but you WILL see results.,"I love ALL the Sylwia dvds. Premier is tough and you will probably not make it through without having to stop it for a moment or two the very first couple times you do it but OH MY! The results! I've lost inches and toned up in places I never thought I'd get toned again (41 years old, 2 kids). I used to do step but not anymore! I even have a ""iffy"" knee and this doesn't bother it at all. 5 stars all around for the whole Tonique series!"
5,what an AMAZING product!,This is a wonderful creation that is so helpful. everyone should buy it! i have had it for a year and have not had any problems! go! buy this! now!
1,Video games as a distraction from Christian worship...,"To understand the authors' true concern (and it's not Playstation), check out this passage from page 81-2, ""The teaching of my Christian faith compel men to follow the model of Jesus Christ...we discover true meaning in life through self-sacrifice, not self gratification. For men, that means finding fulfillment through the sacrificial love of marriage and fatherhood and/or building something that can contribute to the good of others. By disciplining their strengths and skills and investing in the lives of others, men play their God-ordained role in the world. The contrast to young men investing their lives in video games couldn't be starker or sadder... The empty pursuit of game points, levels, adventures, sex, conquest, and domination ends up replacing meaningful goals by draining all desire for the life-renewing, God given passions of real life."""
4,Pete......,"Huge fan of Pete Rose when I was young. I have grown to see he was a great player, but not a good person."
3,Okay.,"I got the book very quickly, which was wonderful, but unfortunately the pages were falling out the first time I read it. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with the seller or whoever they got it from, but it was definitely annoying to try and hold in the pages when only having read it once."
4,madd cool,"First off- I gotta say that Mark Levin is the man!! He is well on his way to developing a film language that speaks to the depth and beauty of hip hop culture. Like ""Slam"", this flick is structurally adventurous and beautifuly acted. Cats in Hollywod betta watch out- Tariq Trotter (aka Black Thought) is not only a dope MC- he's also got madd thesbian chops! Karen Goberman gives a beautifully subtle performance- and Bonz...well Bonz is pure charisma.The film's strenght lies in the chemistry between the two leads. Most flicks depict interracial relationships as either silly and shallow (Jungle Fever) or corny and sentimental (Save the Last Dance). Trotter and Goberman build a smoldering yet subtle connection that helps this flick rise above the usual ""Can't we all just get along"" propoganda.Spend dat money!"
5,"Difficulties, an exercise for the hero","Work can be exceptionally frustrating; heavy workload, changing priorities and responsibilities, demanding customers, fickle bosses, co-workers that don't do their fair share of the work, not to mention the constant fear of getting laid off. Ms. Hubbard's book gives the reader a different way of looking at things. You are empowered to be a hero (instead of a victim) and make a difference despite the difficulties. You learn to see the difficulties ""as an exercise for the hero"". This way of looking at things will most likely make you a more effective employee and happier person."
3,"Thought it was entirely made out of nylon, but pink is wetsuit material","I thought the entire suit was made of nylon, but the pink (or blue) is made of wetsuit material. They're very stiff, but we have yet to use it."
1,it sucked,worst movie i ever seen.boring and bad actino and did not like the actors and the color was bad and it was to long.
5,hachi,Hachi!!! For anyone who loves dogs this is as good as it gets - it transends the usual Hollywood trash. I highly recommend it for all ages.
4,It was pretty good.,The only problem was it was a gift and the dvd cover was one of those super cheap packaging with the card board-like front. I was a little embarrassed that it seemed somewhat cheap. Though the price was cheap! Im not sure if thats the original packaging sent out by distributers or maybe it was intended for a lower priced sale. Either way I read the movie reviews and it sounds like a good movie.
5,A Real Tear Jerker,"I have loved animals all my life. I saw this movie on a cable station a month ago, but they never repeated it. It was a true story, and it made me stop and remember my youth and the great animal ""friends"" I had. Great movie!!!"
5,Hachi,"I have seen Hachi before and bought two copies for friends, I have it in my Library, and it is one of my very favorites Thanks"
5,Great movie,This is one of my family favorite movie I reccomended to all of you if you are going to watch a movie with a family :)
5,What a great movie,"We had seen this movie and wanted to purchase it as a Christmas gift for a grandchild who loves animals. The movie is based on a true story and was very well done. Although she hasn't opened this gift yet, we are sure that it will be a favorite."
5,Hachi: A Dog's Tale,You will need a large box of tissues when you watch this movie. It is a great family time movie.
5,Awesome and Touching Story!,"Honestly,People who HARM dogs, or FIGHT dogs, should be sat in a room all alone, to watch this movie! It is above and beyond the best movie of love and loyalty and what dogs really mean to mankind When all else is gone, the one by your side will be your loyal dog, even beyond the grave until they themselves pass away. Should have been a few oscars handed out for this one!!!"
4,Humbled.,"It was in the last scene of the film that I realized just how good the film is. I couldn't move. I was so taken aback and stuck by a strange feeling of pain in my heart. Richard Gere finds a dog on the road and after numerous attempts at finding it a home finally decides to keep it. His wife is not a dog person so he doesn't know how to convince her but eventually...What really moved me about this film the most was - how complicated we make our lives and how much happiness can be derived from the simplest and noble most of things. This film is about a small community of regular people who care about one another despite being disconnected. Living in the city one tends to cherish little things like being part of such a system of community, unobtrusive and friendly.Wonderful film. I would recommend it again and again."
5,Why I love Hachi,This is an excellent movie! Love the fact that it is a true story. A bit sad in the end.
5,I LOVE this movie,After all what is there not to like about Richard Gere? This movie is a tear jerker but it is still one of those movies that I will watch again and again. I give this one a BIG thumbs up.
1,Movie about death and grief too upsetting for my seven-year-old.,"The packaging of this DVD is very misleading. Nowhere did it even allude to the fact that this movie is about death and grief. My seven-year-old sobbed and sobbed for about the last 40 minutes of the movie. After his beloved owner dies (Richard Gere), the dog Hachi is grief-stricken and for the rest of his life waits at the train station for the master who will never return. It was heartbreaking. I have no interest in watching this movie again and regret that I bought it and showed it to my daughter. I'm surprised it was rated G."
3,Holds your attention.,"This is my first by Genevieve Lyons, and I really enjoyed it. The protagonist, Mark Dangerfield owns a bookstore which his girlfriend, Mandy, helps run. In this novel, Mark is asked to look into the apparent suicide of Alison Alyward. The police have closed the case as a suicide, but a family friend is convinced that she would never commit suicide. Alison hangs out with three other friends that people refer to as the Fab Four. When other members of the group start dying, Mark is certain there is something to be uncovered. During the course of his investigation, Mark is stabbed and then later on has the stuffing beat out of him. As opposed to protagonists who take a licking and just keep going, it was a little more realistic as his wounds managed to keep him down for a few days. Definitely a refreshing change; I'm planning on reading more in this series."
3,Ultimately Average,"The first story arc of the Ultimate X-Men is decent enough and a good way to spend an hour and a half.It's decent enough unless you've read Mark Millar's Authority run, which has basically the same ""widescreen"" comic style with a much better artist, Frank Quitely.The story here is weighed down by Millar's constant need to have a punchline, and the inane continual joking gets to be grating. The characters are poorly defined and their dialogue is interchangeable.Adam Kubert manages to pace the story. It's good enough even if you don't care for his style, like me. Some of the storytelling gets lost and confusing, but he's consistent enough that he doesn't really subtract from the big picture.Still, the basic premise and several key exciting moments make this enjoyable, but certainly doesn't make up for all the flaws."
4,Updated origin of the X-Men,Marvel reimagines the origin of the X-Men in the present day. The underlying mutant vs. human conflict fits well in the current political climate. Unforunately as other reviewers have noted the story suffers from typical Marvel cheesiness at times. I enjoyed this book enough to read more in the series and would recommend this to a fan of the two X-Men movies that is otherwise unfamiliar with the characters.
5,The best X-Series ON THE MARKET!,"I picked up this book, and it truly is the best X-Book currently. I t is your fave X-men suchn as Storm, Beast, Wolverine, Magneto, etc. I really like the way the stories are presented to a younger audience. I would tell any X-Fan to read this!"
5,a must have!,"This is a great book. It does not force-feed you tons of licks or voicings. Instead, it shows you how to practice better, by reducing problems to a manageable size. Berkman is a funny writer, very knowledgeable, full of anecdotes and insights, and full of ideas on how to practice and become a better, truer jazz musician. This is THE book to have if you want to find your own licks, your own voicings, your own voice, regardless of your instrument. There is enough stuff in there to last me for years!"
3,Nail Clipper,Product did the job rather well. Very sharp. Was a little disappointed with the vendor's claim that clipper was manufactured in the USA. It in fact is manufactured in China. This makes a big difference as far as quality is concerned. I have to use it for a few months before I get a true picture of what it is worth.
2,Could be better,I was quite dissapointed. To many instructions on how to buy hunting gear but only few good hunting tips. The handbook looks more like school book. I had to wait to find that out more than one mounth and the end price for book and taxes and shipping to Europe came out 45$.
4,Helpful study resource,"From my limited experience, the Shepherd's Notes series are valuable resources for study. I have been leading a Sunday School class through 1, 2 Peter and Jude, and Shepherd's Notes give me a quick, easily comprehended overview as I'm preparing. It's not comprehensive, nor intended to be, but it helps me order my thoughts and catch the big picture of the whole book and then each section in order. The only other Shepherd's Notes volume I have used is the one for Calvin's Institutes, in which I was displeased to find they did not include Book IV. I presume because the publisher has baptist commitments and Calvin deals with the Church and the Sacraments in Book IV, but that is another topic for another day. I have been pleased with their guide for 1, 2 Peter and Jude, and will consider ordering other editions in the future."
3,"A gorgeous classic album, but stripped of 2 songs","At Christmastime, I think most people reach for things comfortable, things that bring back happy memories of Christmases past. For many of us, that means reaching for Johnny Mathis records. Er, make that CDs. And while Mathis's classic, _Merry Christmas_, is available in all its glory, his other classic, _The Sounds of Christmas_, isn't.Well, sort of. This album repackages _The Sounds of Christmas_, but deletes ""Have Reindeer Will Travel"" and ""The Little Drummer Boy."" What were these people thinking?!I borrowed my mother's well-worn 1964-ish pressing of _The Sounds of Christmas_ and made a tape that combines _Christmas with Johnny Mathis_ and the two lost songs. It's not perfect, but it'll do."
2,Beautiful case for a very cheap clock,"I ordered this clock a month ago, and for the last three weeks it's been sitting in my living room. The case is beautiful, but the clock is worthless. It's one of those cheap plastic cases with the AA battery and the little flywheel that lets you set the time. It has been losing about 5 minutes an hour and I have been constantly resetting it. If you want a nice box, order this and take out the clock and toss it. If you want a clock, don't bother."
1,Don't waste your money,"The back cover of the guide promisses ""expert lessons"". Where? It's just more general suggestions. I already know I need to learn the counter system to be effective at this game. The booklet with the game tells me that. HOW PRIMA? HOW DO I DO IT? There's no lesson. There's no how to. I'm still looking for the promised ""gaurd breaks"" list in the ""character strategies"" section. Sounds like it's something I'd really like to try. This guide makes it seem like an effective tool. Too bad that other then a general description of what a guard break will do for me, there's no actual instruction on the technique.Great I know all the character moves that you can't possibly hope to accomplish while the computer has you in a 99999 punch juggle. I can get that info for free on gamefaq.com. I was actually better as a button masher at this game than I am armed with this worthless guide."
1,Musicmatch is a waste of money,"I started with a boxed version and found myself paying another $20 for an upgrade. This software is simply a gateway to their online music service. In itself that's not a bad thing but they have a history of using upgrades to sell you the same product several times. The current version in many ways is not as good as previous versions. It's a resource hog. If all you use your computer for is to listen to music you won't notice this but if you have to do anything else to do (other than word process), you'll find you'll be doing it in silence. Your real dissatisfaction will come when you need customer support. Ther responses you get are so generic you wonder if they even read your letter or if they can read at all. I had a problem and after five emails it is still unresolved. There are a lot of programs that will rip music and manage your files and there are a lot of suscription music services. Shop around a while. Musicmatch might not be exactly what you want."
1,Don't buy,"I ordered this for the capability to record from an outside source (record player, DAT machine) and encode into MP3 and CD formats. There are no level or tone controls for recording in this manner (only playback) and everything I recorded, despite the level or sampling rate I input the signal at, came out totally distorted from my DAT machine, my boombox, my 8 track, EVERYTHING. Their online music downloading or radio station or something like that is also no longer supported but they fail to tell you that before you buy it. I don't remember exactly what it is because that's not the reason I purchased. This is junk. Trust me. Go buy something better than this. I returned it. Now I want my shipping back too."
4,Just what you might expect from Mr. Amano,"Takashi Amano is a highly revered aquarist whose planted tanks have won him recognition and awards the world over. He is also an accomplished photographer and understands what it takes to capture a great tank photo. Is it any wonder that this book is a hit amongst those aspiring to a more beautiful planted fish tank? On top of being an inspiring book (and a great coffee table book), Mr Amano teaches you the fundementals of tank design with some great insight into balance and colour harmony.While this book is very inspiring, it is not a comprehensive planted aquarium book. You would do well to purchase this book alongside a general ""how to"" book on planted Aquaria."
2,Just... OK,"I purchased this book based on some of the older ""rave"" reviews, and was somewhat disappointed. There are some good, basic ideas on meeting management, leadership, etc., but some of them are rather trite (Myers-Briggs typing, etc.) I think this book would be a good starting point to someone in middle management on a project, but if you're beyond this point you may not find anything new."
2,Good for newbies,"Good title but thats about it - nothing new and innovative in this book. A lot of little common knowledge tid bits. Good for newbies, but not for anyone who studies PM."
2,Basic Project Management,"This is a good book for people starting in the Project Management field, but does not add too much value for those who are experienced project managers."
5,"A Great Help from the ""Good Old Days""",I own this wonderful book. With a little creativity and thought most of the ideas can be useful today.The sections are very helpful when you just want to find a quick hint. The section entitled Indoor Games might be used to get your family moving again. Some of the games are active physically.Or the book is just plain fun to read and share with family and friends.
5,One of the best!!,"This is a beautiful book with wonderful pictures and text. It is ""one of the best"" new books on the market. The pictures show lovely old quilts--some are old patterns that a person will recognize and some a fascinating combination that will be new to most quilters. Definitely a book worth owning!"
2,Boring suggestions,"I've always liked the bay area backroads show because they find some really unique and interesting places that I would never have known about on my own. This deck contains none of them. It is more of a list of national parks in Northern California. There is nothing unique about the destinations given, and more often then not I found that the cards I looked at were places that I have already visited... in some cases on a regular basis.I had hoped that by purchasing this I would be able to just grab a random card and take off on some crazy Saturday adventure. I'm rather dissapointed."
4,"""Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.""","Matthew 5:48 ""Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect."". It seems to me that this book correlates with the teachings of the Christian Scriptures and forces our minds to except the reality of following a being who is God our Father than a theoratical concept. I read this book not because of my interest in Philosophy and/or Worldviews only but because understanding Christ and His Scripture the Bible. This book created more thirst for the Knowledge of Christ; motivated me to read Scriptures more, and encouraged me to knowing and loving Christ personally (ontologically) through Bible Study, Prayer and Communion in Trinity."
5,Thanks,This bible is everything the seller said it was. It has become a irreplaceable part of my library. Thanks for the great condition of the book and the speedy delivery!
3,MORE Paz Vega,"I purchased this movie after having seen Paz Vega in ""10 Itemsor less"". ""Say I Do"", is about a sexy unknown actress being teamedup with a dorky cinema usher on a dating game type reality game show in Spain.Paz Vega is excellant as the ""sexy actress"", she is a born comedian, butthe dorky usher is just too dorky. He doesn't seem to realize he is withthis stunning beautiful charming woman. He treats her as if she is a pest,which is just too hard to believe.On a side note, I have now seen Paz Vega in 'Spanglish', '10 Items orLess', and now in 'Say I Do'.....and in each movie she portrays a totallydifferent character. She is a brilliant actress. She should have recievedan Acadamy Award nomination for Spanglish.....Just my opinion."
1,PNY Geforce FX5200 256MB PCI Graphics Card,"This Graphics card didnot work as expected, after numerous attempts to resolve installation and operation problems, the card was returned for refund,(which I have not received as of this date.) I WOULD NOT reccomend this graphics card to anyone with built in graphics card in their computer. There seems to be too many software conflicts."
1,ONE STAR FROM ME,"YIKES! I'm sure it works well, with older computers. BUT, my Dell Inspiron, 530 with Intel core 2 Duo hates it, would not boot up at all. Why? Its not as good as the on board graphics,or out of date. My Lenovo 3000 J series 115 AMD X2 ,Ditto, On board graphics better. Now it will work on the Lenovo, BUT, there is a big downgrade in performance. So be careful. I will, buy another card from this company, if they have the right one,to meet my needs. I am not knocking this product! It's, what it is, and it's not ""it"" for me . :)PS: I just took the card out of my Lenovo, It has, built in, ""Geforce 6100"" graphics, SO DUH! Look at your graphics device, in your device manager . It may be wise, to use this information, to order a card. Please make sure your PCI Slots work with the card you are ordering."
4,No complaints here!,"I got this graphic card, and I must say it is great. I have my cpu hooked up to my television (37"" flat screen hdtv) and you can definitely see the hd quality in viewing videos, pictures, and games. I recommend this highly; especially for the asking price."
3,Cheap solution,"This product is ok, not the best graphics card on the market. This was just a cheap solution on my PC because I only have 1 available PCI slot otherwise I would have bought a better card. I only needed this card to play doom 3 :) Overall this was an excellent solution given the conditions."
1,Underpowered!!,"Planning to run this card on a Windows Vista machine?? don't!!! The performance score is 2.4 and 2.5 for office apps and games respectively. Choppy graphics, colors look run down and I just sent it back to Amazon. Planning to buy a card with at least 512 MB RAM for Windows Vista."
3,"VIDEO CARD< NANCEEL R. PAYSON SWARTZ, 46, BOSTON","VIDEO CARD< NANCEEL R. PAYSON-SWARTZ, 46, BOSTON. PNY GEFORCE FX 5200 PCI 256 MB 2 PORT VGA + S VIDEO GRAPHICS CARD VCGFX522PEB-RETAIL HAS DUAL CAPABILITIES AND WORKS WITH MOST PROCESSORS> REVIEWS HAVE BEEN MIXED BUT IT IS A STATE OF THE ART TECHNOLOGY."
1,Worked OK but now crashing my PC weekly,"Installed on Windows 7 PC.This seemed to work OK but didn't support some fancier video functions (like Windows Virtual PC). Not a big deal b/c it's a running a third monitor.BUT... after a few months I noticed that my PC was crashing about 1/week with that monitor showing an error message that there was a memory parity error (error in the Video Card RAM I assume). To confirm it, I pulled that card out for 2 months. NO crashes. Put it back in, got the crashes again about once per week.Tried updating the driver. Still having crashes (perhaps a little less frequently)"
2,Don't Bother,"I always thought that while movies about incest were shocking in, say, 1975, that path had been well-worn. Not to say that I'm only looking for shock in movies, but I found this highly-praised drama to be flat and bloodless. Sure the acting is good, but the script is rather pedestrian, the characters uninteresting, and after the end we don't get a sense that much has changed. And it's all told so slowly, with lots of portentious flashbacks (it reminded me in that regard of Barbra Streisand's Nuts, another wildly-overpraised film) as though there's this great profundity when in fact there's nothing but banality. I was waiting for the twist, the surprising insight, but it never came. The video box is plastered with awards and nominations, but compared to the ground-breaking Italian cinema of the past, this is banal television. Can't say I'd recommend this, unless you're looking for something light. Yes, light. It seems odd to describe a movie about incest that way, but 2007 isn't 1975."
4,Loved it,"This was the first Bateman book that I was given to read by my pastor while living in Northern Ireland and I loved it so much that I reread it 3 times! Bateman is witty, punny and so very clever. His style may not be for everyone, as it takes someone who is tuned into ""that type"" of humour so be aware."
3,Great for Practice!,The problems in this book are gennerally harder compared to CERM practice problems and the NCEES practice problems. The edition I got (3rd edition) is not in the multiple choice format... so you cannot reverse engineer your way to the question. Their are also a couple of variables that are assummed (that you would not expect)on certain practice problems. But in general good practice on the methodology and approach
4,Good signing book for kids,"Signing Is Fun is comprised of a series of pictures of signs along with the definition and a very brief explanation how to do the sign. Sometimes, the signs are grouped together by topic such as putting colors together. In other cases, very simple phrases are created such as ""My name is [Tom]"".This would be too simple for adults, but my son (<10) and I enjoyed going through the book together. Signing Is Fun doesn't explain how ASL is used in practice. The intent is more a matter of learning some simple signs.I know that there are free sites on the Internet that provide the same information and more, but the book format is handy."
2,No size descriptions,"The pajama set that I ordered for my nephew does not fit him. It will probably fit him in about 3 years. The problem was that there were no descriptions of the sizes, and there were only three options for sizes, and they were odd, something like XS, L and XL. It would have been helpful to know what XS and L meant."
5,YAY!,THIS IS THE FIRST SEASON OF THE SHOW. IT IS VERY FUNNY. THERE ARE MANY JOKES AND NO COMMERCIALS. MANY FUNNY EPISODES TO ENJOY.
2,Harbinger Exercise Mat,I ordered this mat a couple of months ago to do toning and arobic exercises to a video. This mat is way too soft for this purpose. It is good for laying on but not for standing exercises. I would not recommend this mat.
2,Stale,Don't know expiration date but these puppies are hard and stale instead of previouse purchases of the same item that were soft and moist. Had to through them out.
5,Great for kids,"My 2 year old son loves watching the Fraggle Rock, or as he says ""Watch rock!"".. If you have young children this is a great idea, the shows are as good as you remember from your childhood, and they are in no way annoying to watch over and over like other children shows. Only issue we have is trying to find a Fraggel Rock costume for our son to wear this Halloween."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS WORTHLESS PRODUCT,"I purchased this a month ago. The twin bed it was to be put on just arrived. I began to put the mattress pad on and it literally shredded in my hands. NOW I find I cannot get a full refund and I have to pay the postage to boot. Horrible, cheap product. Do not waste your money."
2,"Would Have Liked, But...","We probably would have liked this pad more, but for one big thing... It is nearly impossible for one person to get it on a queen-sized bed. Also, it will not stay on the bed when you do get it on, sliding off repeatedly and easily. It did not want to lay flat either, but rather ""bunchy"". One other thing we didn't like is the non-woven polyester fabric sides. Since it was such a struggle to put on, we would have liked sturdier woven fabric sides. I wish the manufacturers would stop being so ""stingy"" on the sizing; this one was a little too small on the top-side, as well, before washing. This ""stingy sizing"" issue seems to be a common problem with most mattress pads now. Otherwise, we probably would have liked this pad."
3,Crunchy and bunchy,"I saw the reviews on this product and decided to purchase it. It does work ok, but is somewhat ""crunchy""- not plastic-feeling like many others, but does take some getting used to. I find it also to be rather ""bunchy"". It forms a circle when you hold it up ready to put it on and never settles into the corners of the mattress like you would like it to. The advantage is that it does not easily come off, but it also does not ever lay flat on the mattress causing some bunching. We still use it, but I would rather it had a better fit and a less stiff feel."
2,Not the soft feel I expected,"When I took this pad out of the package, I was surprised by the feel of it. I guess I should have known going in that a cotton BLEND wouldn't have the same soft feel as pure cotton, but I was surprised by just how stiff it felt. Oddly, the waterproof side intended to go towards the mattress was softer than the padded side intended to go facing up. It definitely had a plumper fill to it than some other pads, but I wasn't looking for that.It may be that some of the stiffness would have come out after washing, but I decided not to risk it and returned it immediately."
2,It's Not Waterproof!,"Contrary to the claims, this mattress pad is not waterproof. If it weren't so much effort I'd return it for a refund. Don't buy it if you truly need a barrier between the mattress and a bed-wetter!"
1,Don't bother,"Be careful how you wash this. I have washed it 4 times. The first 3 I aired dried it. Last time I put it in the dryer and it has melted together. I set it to delicate, low heat and only had it in 15 minutes before I checked it. I would not buy it again."
2,Hard to Understand,"Larry Brown is a legend, but maybe his time has passed. Like Lenny Wilkens and other coaches whom I've humili -- looked up to, he seems to have lost the ability to get through to Stephon Marb -- young players everywhere, not necessarily Stephon Marbury. This book would have been better if it had been written by a former Detroit Piston Hall of Fame guard who isn't Dave Bing. Please don't fire me."
2,Broke after a few uses,I bought it a while back but it's worthless and I would not buy again. It's good for a few months then its prone to break.
3,ok book,The book was ok but it really didn't go into detail about blocking spam besides Spam Assassin. I could have really used more information about spam bouncer and razor. scohen@scohen.mysticjj.com
3,Bunn BxB 10-Cup Brewer,"There is nothing wrong with the machine (other than I wish it had an automatic turn off like event he cheap brewers have) except that the recommended filter, Medelco 8 - 10 cup permanent filter) is is WAY TOO SMALL for this machine. I have to fill in with a paper filter so it defeats the whole purpose of having a permanent filter. Even with the paper the filter overflows coffee grounds. There needs to be a LARGER filter to fit this machine. The machine is fast and other than having to fuss with the filter and a mess to clean out, it makes good coffe."
2,dissatisfied,I am very disappointed with this coffee maker. I purchased it about 6 months ago. If you don't use it everyday you have to fill the storage or the coffee does not brew correctly. It is very difficult to figure out how much water to put in before it brews as to not over fill the coffee maker. The coffee maker is difficult to clean. My cousin purchased hers around the same time and is dissatisfied also. The coffee maker makes a great pot of coffee but is not worth the hassle. I will be replacing the coffee maker.
5,Very good taste,I used to try lots of coffee maker and was very frustrated. Because I can NOT find any good taste coffee by those machine under $100.I am so supprised this one taste so GOOD and under $100........Highly recommend!~
4,I love this coffee maker,"BUT I can see that others may fear it. It has a reserve tank that keeps the water hot 24/7. This is an energy waster but I like my coffee fast and this machine delivers. I only gave it 4 out of 5 because I know this would scare the novice users; like my parents who don't understand the reserve heated water tank. If you are a true coffee lover and want it fast, this is it."
5,Bunn excellence,After almost twenty years of flawless service my original Bunn is now in my office at work. The BXB 10-cup maker is a perfect replacement. The only drawback is that no water carafe is supplied with this unit. Highly recommend this maker.
5,Outstanding,"Finally, a program that make learning Grammar easy and simple for kids (and their teachers). This clear-cut approach is covers capitalization, punctuation, dictionary usage, sentence combining, and grammar concepts and usage. The topics are presented, made clear and reinforced throughout the year. An excellent resource! I highly recommend this product!"
5,I Loved it!,I really did like this one.Although I like all of Sandra Browns books.After reading this one I felt as though I lived it.
3,Just ok! Don't shoot me!,"Soap star and hunk (Drake Rivington) + deaf daughter (Jennifer) + deceased wife/ballerina (Susan) + secrets + pretty ""red headed"" teacher (Lauri) = romance and love. That's about it. The secret I guessed early on, the romance was a given and the story is ok. You can read it about a day. It is not to heavy or hard to understand...something to take your mind off your troubles."
4,Jerry's review on Solving Tough Problems,"At last! An easy to read book true to Bohm's vision of dialogue that will begin moving the subject from an esoteric phenomenon to a practice attainable by many. This book should not be considered as a primer on dialogue that could replace works such as ""On Dialogue"" or ""dialogue, the art and practice of thinking together"", rather it presents the author's experience in practical application of many of the concepts and principles discussed in those earlier works."
3,stains,These tights are durable and heavy duty and pretty too so my daughter says. However I will not be ordering these again because after my daughters first dance class they are stained like she was playing in the dirt with them on. I followed the washing instructions hand washed them and hung to dry they look worse after I washed them. This tights attract dirt and that would be fine if the dirt came out but the dirt stays put no matter how often you hand wash them.
4,Destined to be a cult classic.,Great fun watching the reality stars I've grown to love/hate in a movie. The script is clever and kept me guessing. The DVD extras alone made this a great find.
1,"Torture Corn, USA...","Filmed entirely on location in the poorly-lit, filthy garage of the world's most enormous, perverted hillbilly, MACHINED is... well, a catastrophic, cardiac arrest of a film. The aforementioned, monstrously huge gent builds his own murderer (yep, robo-dink) out of spare parts and some guy he runs over w/ his car! Alas, the execution of this idea is nowhere near as good as it might sound. Rather than interesting characters, we are shown several half-wits being chased, caught, and tortured to death by a lumbering kill-droid w/ lights on his head. Meanwhile, the big guy without a shirt watches it all on video, while drooling and scooping out another dollop of his favorite ointment. Lacking any thrills or chills, MACHINED does triumph in the ""incredibly large man's impossibly hairy back"" department! He's quite a specimen! Ladies?..."
2,Not worth getting,"The book is not a handbook. It is a primer with lots of exercises. It also includes answers to the exercises and a short dictionary. If you want a primer and want to do exercises, you can consider getting this book. Otherwise, you can have a look atJapanese Verbs at a Glance (Power Japanese Series) (Kodansha's Children's Classics). That book also has problems, nut is much better."
1,East Wing?,"The quality of this season was really low compared to the rest. The writing isn't as sharp, there's a lack of humour that's usually present and the actors seem like they're bored. Especially Martin Sheen, by the look on his face you would think a heart attack was imminent. Also, moreclaw never shuts up about it. So I'm afriad 1 star it will have to be."
4,"Very Interesting Plots, Slightly Less Witty...","This season had everything a political drama could possibly have from the president stepping down (momentarily), to the VP stepping down (for good), all the way to supreme court justices confirmations. The story lines were intense, and a few of the episodes rank in the top five of all time for the West Wing series.I only gave it four stars, however, because this season was clearly written by different writers who did not have quite the same level of wit as the former writer had. It was missing that little bit of edge. Overall, I am very glad I bought it, and you probably will be too."
3,Where did you go Aaron Sorkin?,"The series gained a tough edge in its fifth season. Lots of political in-fighting, less feel good stuff. It is still fun to follow the cast, just not as much fun without Aaron Sorkin."
4,dogs of war,This is a great episode and one of my favorites in the whole west wing series. These are also two of the most dramatic episodes with the kidnapping of zoey bartlett.
3,Squee Review,"While I was overall impressed with the book itself, the condition in which it came was no where near like the proffered ""Like New"" on the ad. The cover was scratched and worn and the spine had a small split in in. If I were you, I would review my opinion on ""Like New"".I was, however, impressed by the price of the item (shipping not included), and the item itself was wonderful."
5,Wonderful,"This book is, in the fewest words possible, amazing. The characters are intelligent, funny, and even a little creepy. Although a little more tame than JTHM it is still greatly disturbing and entertaining. I also love all the extras that were from the original comics of JTHM that were added into here. overall a great graphic novel for any intelligent reader."
4,Great Battery Backup Lights!,"I have purchased 3 of these. Great lights so far. They are not super bright, but will allow you to see your way through a home or business in the event of a power failure. I know of another business owner who also has these, and the batteries lasted a few years before not holding a charge anymore. So, test them every six months, and you can't go wrong at this price!"
1,Grammatica ?,Spanish teachers: Wouldn't you be rather wary of a Spanish grammar book whose title misspells the main word ?
3,Orbit Sprinkler Rain Sensor - works o.k.,"This Orbit Rain Sensor was difficult to set up with the wiring. I needed to call the company for technical support which was very helpful.It does shut off nicely after a lot of rain, though. For a puny rain, the sprinklers will still go. It has a nice override feature, to turn off sprinklers at the touch of a button.The problem here is whenever there is a power outage, the unit stops functioning from then on, and you need to manually reset the unit's program to work. Trouble is, power outages are frequently during rain storms. If you are away on vacation, you are out of luck with resetting the unit after an outage, and the sprinklers will end up going automatically as per your set program."
1,Fabulous Show - Obsolete Format,"This great program from the Chieftains and their friends has been a Yuletide staple at our house for the past 20 years. It's a bloody shame RCA can't do this video the justice it deserves and release it on DVD and Blu-ray. I have the LaserDisc version which is much better than this VHS tape, but both of those formats have been obsolete going on 10 years. All of the other Chieftains videos are available on DVD at least. Why not this one?"
4,Good story.. not as captivating as some.,Gave me an idea of what a tour of duty involved. Would have liked to have the personal challenges communicated more completely.
4,Raw Meatloaf,"I found this CD to be a refreshing change from all the CD's that just seem to re-hash Bat out of Hell. The songs are gripping, lyrics, solid, rock hard. Meatloaf shows that he is an artist and not just a flash. With depth and feeling."
3,It's Meatloaf doing Meatloaf Music,"Meatloaf is who he is and so are most of his albums. I bought several other than his hit albums just to complete my collection. Can't say any one song jumped out (i.e. there is no paradise by the dashboard lights) so, if you like his music style buy it. If you are looking to be blown away, don't."
4,"Nifty gadget, but....","Pretty good size gadget even for Asian hands. Feels firm and solid for prolong usage. Heat dissipated is generally acceptable.But Vista is definitely not suitable to run on this kind of machine. Recommended to upgrade to 2GB RAM with XP and the machine is almost perfect. Can't expect blazing fast processing and speed as this is running on a low voltage processor.Overall a pretty good second machine for web, simple games and office applications."
1,Very difficult to use,"First I had to buy a DVD drive to install Office 2003. I should have been able to do that from my laptop drive. Some of the program downloaded ok such as Outlook messages but not my contacts, calendar or notes.Excel seemed to work ok but Word documents were garbage.The writing started out ok but now it just stalls and I have to resort to the keyboard on the screen. Still have not figured out the buttons, i.e. shifting to symbols instead of letters.It stalls a lot and I have to take the battery off and put it back on frequently. I would think that for $1,000, it would work a whole lot better."
5,Kicks @$$,"This isn't really a ""best of"" album. It contains all of the songs released on their ""Tattooed Beat Messiah"" album."
3,"Not bad, but not great","These guys aren't very impressive really. But they DON'T suck. If anything, their few difficult to play parts are what saves them from total crashing destruction. So, as players I can give them credit, as song writers.....bah."
4,Very happy.....,I was impressed at the time of arrival.... and also the wonderful condition....Great Job!!!
5,"in reply to the review titled ""pure garbage""","this is a reply to the person who rated this dvd one star titling his/her review ""pure garbage"". newsflash: this is a review of the DVD not the show. If you dont like the TV show, well go complain to someone who actually cares, not someone who is looking to buy the DVD."
5,Sturdy product,These worked fine and I think they will last. They allow you to get a firm grip on the edge of a pecan.
4,its actually alright...,"the movie wasnt as bad as i expected, but it is still a bit cheesey. i would only reccomend this movie if you like horror movies and if you have a lot of extra time to kill."
2,They Could've Had It All,"This movie is filmed well, so obviously some effort went into making it. The premise is a good one, although not very original. Those are bout the only good thing about this. The writing is horrible. The characters are cardboard cut outs. Everything about this is completely contrived. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Uggh,"Terrible. Premise is interersting, but the movie is just terrible. Some really bad acting - especially noticeable when one of the female actors has to so very obviously turn to look at cue cards apparently. I get the impression this film was made by some church group trying to evangelize because of the over-the-top ""believer vs non-believer"" thread to seems to be the main message of this film. The end scene especially is soooo bad.Special effects are ok, but very minimal. If there was suspense, one could look past this, but the the plot and characters are far too weak to make up for it.I wouldn't waste the time unless you just have to see every ghost story made. I wish I had skipped this one."
4,Great Axe,"The Fiskars Pro Splitting Axe is a great axe, from a great manufacturer, in a great country (Finland).Pros:-Out of the boxes it's razor sharp-The handle doesn't splinter like wood-Doesn't dull or nick easily (The Fiskars hatchet seems to be made of cheaper steel or something, it nicks and dulls on wood this axe easily plows through.)-Cool head design- The head was obviuosly forged for one purpose: to split wood. That doesn't mean it can't do other tasks, like chopping down small trees, breaking windows, etc.-Lifetime Warrenty!- It's a Fiskars. Need I say more?Cons-Handle can be slippery when wet-The sheath is a peice of crap, but you can always get a leather one.-I've heard that when you hit the butt of the axe hard enough (like a hammer), the head can pop out. Don't know if it's true, but seems logical based on the design.Overall, great axe, no real glaring flaws, just needs a better sheath."
3,no to shabby,"well made, however it is far too light weight and did not come with any real edge; understandable, it is a splitting ax. for something this light though, it should have been sharp. overall it is a quality product just not on the scale of anything more than a pack ax"
2,Where did the friendship go?,"I have read a few books by Diana Palmer and I must say that my satisfaction has been hit and miss. I loved ""Champayne Girl"" by DP and looked forward to reading ""Friends and Lovers"".This is a book about two ""friends"" Madeline and John who both are attracted to each other. John has been ready to be more longer than Madeline but even when she is aware of her feelings she is to much of a ""child"" to see it.I like a strong man, an in control man, but I also like the woman to have some backbone. I also would like a leading lady I can identify with or atleast like. I did not find that in this book. She lied to him and herself almost till the end. She keep their pregnancy from him and I can't stand that. He may have been stubborn/hardheaded but sad to say I could identify with John more than Madeline."
3,No case,"I was expecting the product to come in a case, but it was just in CD sleeves. I wasn't impressed with its packaging. I would have sent it back, but the DVDs were fine. I just don't have a case for them."
1,Bad Disc,"I watched the disc 1 with no issues however the disc 2 would not play at all I tried both DVD players in my house as well my two blu ray players as well as my computer and it just would not play . I took a good look at the disc and it looks like it has been handled alot as if it had been used before with lots of scratches. When I got the box set it was wrapped in plastic wrap so i had no reason to question weather or not it was new , until now."
3,Mediocre Fantastical Political Thriller,"Here's a confession: I always thought that The Black Panther is the second best solo superhero in the Marvel Universe, that is, after Spider-Man, of course. Given the right ingredients of darkness and grim & gritty tone, he would've soared through the comic market hall of fame to the likes of Batman or Daredevil.Yet, here again, that cool-costumed vigilante (lose the stupid cape please) fell short of his true potential to weave an interesting domain of urban ghetto universe. Had they brought him to a more down to earth, yet serious conflicts, his coolness and danger would've shown through. If Marvel read this, just give me the Black Panther and I'll revamp the character through and through so he will be a badass king of dark, urban costumed crimefighters."
1,Very expensive strobe light,"Bought this as a dual reading lamp. Turns out one side of double lamp acts as a strobe light randomly flashing on and off while trying to read. If I wanted a strobe lamp I could've bought one at a head shop for quite a bit less. Trying to return the item has proven to be very problematic as it is through a fourth party buisness and must obtain approval and inspection prior to refund. Don't bother with this piece of $*!t. Stacks and Stacks sucks. Customer service sounds like she purely hates her job and thus far, Amazon is of no help. Easy Returns Policy my a$$! Save your money and purchase elsewhere."
3,Time Shift Review - It's Okay,"Time shift is the standard post-apocolyptic first person shooter with the standard array of weapons and tactics. On the positive side, the AI is intelligent, shifty, and reacts to any part of their body that you shoot. The environment is very similar to the feeling of Requiem or Red Faction II in that you're always fighting through tunnels and open streets. The weaponry is decent, but nothing new under the sun. The ability to time shift itself is great, however, the effects don't last as long as they should. On the downside, the campaign mode is LOOOOONG. I never thought the game would end. I'm all about a good first person shooter, but after a while, it's just continually running and gunning."
1,bland and boring,"I am sick and tired of the same video games being churned out every year. this is a poor game but I was so bored that I beat the whole game haha. the graphics are mediocre, the gameplay is mediocre, and the dialogue is BORING. luckily i bought this game for 3 bucks at gamestop HAHAHHAHAHA, no wonder why now..."
4,"fun, end is tough, short","Lots of fun, a little too short and the end is tough as H*ll!I enjoyed the campaign, albeit a bit too short.A nice twist on regular shooters learning to do the time travel thing. Fun Fun!"
2,enlightening yet boring,The book did enlighten me yet it was boring to read. There are better books about college football(I have most of them). If you want to cuddle up by the fireplace with a good sports book leave this one alone and read Friday Night Lights.
2,Caution!,"Caution. This product looks good enough, however, it does not fit either the truck or the winch that the website suggested. Now, it will cost approx 35% of purchase price to return it and pay the 20% restocking fee. I would not recommend buying this online without a better return policy, as you it is not as simple to match a winch and truck to their recommendations as we thought. Expensive lesson, and still need a winch carrier..."
5,Great for adopted children too!,"This is a great book! We have so many books in our home that I hadn't even realized how great this book is. My mom had gotten it and I had totally forgotten about it until my 6 year old grabbed it for a car trip. There's a special section at the end talking about adoption and about how Jesus was adopted by Joseph.It discusses the virgin birth very well which, let's face it,can be a little tricky for any parent. The 2 different texts-large print for ages 3-8 and the smaller print for 9-14-is a great idea."
2,Disappointing,"I read a bunch of reviews on this movie, and I was really excited about seeing it. The first 25-30 minutes were very good... quirky, funny and a little bit over the top... then it started going down hill. I understand this was a ""made for TV"" movie, so the acting is usually somewhat special, but this was REALLY bad. There was no passion... it was just flat.Overall, I was just disappointed. I am really glad I watched it before I purchased it."
3,The Christmas Card,"Nice Christmas time movie. Cute story line. Editing is a little slopppy and choppy. Continuity fails many times leaving holes in the script. I thought the ending was rotten. There could have been another three to five minutes that would have been a much more satisfactory ending with Faith's father and mother involved. I liked the movie a lot, but it was hard to follow sometimes."
5,The Christmas Card movie,"I have enjoyed this movie since it came out. I purchased it this year and my husband enjoyed watching it with me. We didn't meet through a christmas card but he was special forces army and we met and fell in love in two weeks! (16 years ago!) The romantic that I am was thrilled to see several similarities in this sweet love story. The commitment to stay in contact with the troops is important and this film provided a good avenue to remind us of that. John Newton's portrayal of Cody was so heartfelt; I fell in love with him, too! great job!!"
2,Average romance for a wet afternoon,I will do a review but you've got to make more effort to tell me when films have subtitles. OK?
4,THE CHRISTMAS CARD,NICE CLEAN MOVIE. NO SWEARING AND FAMILY MOVIE. A GOOD MOVIE. I UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS HALL MARKS HIGHEST RATED MOVIE. THATS WHAT ED ASNER SAYS IN EXTRA FEATURE. ALSO ON EXTRA FEATURE THEIR IS A REAL LIFE CHRISTMAS CARD COUPLE AND TELLS HOW THEY MET.
3,Clean Family Christmas Movie,"This is a good clean Christian Christmas movie for the whole family. Very nice and easy. Not much chemistry between the main characters, but still nice. BTW, our main guy Cody is cute. Enjoy!"
4,Wonderful Christmas Story,This is a wonderful little love story that will be a popular Christmas story for years to come!
5,The Christmas Card,"This was a very moving, special Christmas story! I would highly recommend it to every sentimental soul that is looking for a love story."
5,"Everything was Awesome, and very professional!","Love, love this movie! I can't say enough about it and the seller was so prompt in getting it shipped to me, even with the holidays! I had it in time to watch for Christmas!!! Just a wonderful feel good movie. It was in Excellent shape as described."
4,Good Christmas Romance...,"Sorry, can't give this 5 stars like ""A Wonderful Life"" but this is good Christmas romance date movie for women (and gay men, I can say that I'm gay!); I'd definitely buy it and watch it every year. Attractive leads who can act (Ed Asner is wonderful as usual), good - if not predictable - script, and nice scenery. I'd love to live in THAT home - Christmas and always! Nothing here of interest to kids though, it's very much a chick flick."
4,The Christmas Card,"I enjoy Hallmark Christmas movies, but this is a favorite. The location, scenery and snow make it a must-have DVD for me."
3,A nice Christmas movie,"Even though I make time to watch this movie every Christmas, it gets 3 stars from me. I did like the story line and enjoyed the beautiful winter scenes. Ed Asner and John Newton are both wonderful actors and their relationship on screen is very sincere. And the movie itself has a wonderful meaning about family values and reaching out to strangers. I think, it was just a little bit unrealistic (for me anyhow) in how the romance weaves its way into the story; but then again many movies do this sort of thing so it's not uncommon. It is worth watching because of it's simpleness and heartwarming element, and, of course, happy endings can never go astray."
3,Good Hot Chocolate,I have purchased this in the past two years and found the hot chocolate flavoring a great tast on cold days. I also like the touch of Cinnamon. It also tastes good with a small candy cane dropped in the mug.Mike M. Ohio
5,Great gift for the man on your list.,"We gave this to our grandsons with a movie. Since we cannot take them to a movie, they can enjoy the hot Chocolate with their wives and see the movie at home. Great little extra for them."
2,I dont like the cases,I love play with me sesame but the cases these come in are crap! The discs came loose. I wish they were packaged different but it is still a good show
4,Great fun!,"Play With Me Sesame: Good Night Sesame is really good for an entertaining and educational DVD for the very young. The skits are fun and funny for little people. Some of the skits are most hilarious. The only thing I would suggest is that there is a Twinkle Twinkle Little Star which is a bit of a shout-fest and therefore not conducive to getting to bed time. Otherwise, a highly endorsed DVD!"
5,Great Product!,"Great Range! I researched the other major players and found these headphones to be the best bang for the buck. Don't hesitate, buy these now! I have owned these for two months and am grinning from ear to ear!"
3,works but not so well,"I bought the headphones so that my boyfriend can watch the movies he likes without bothering me (we have a tiny appartment). But the headphones doesn't work if you don't keep the sound of the television so that there always a little noise. furthermore, as it is radio, the sound is not perfect in the headphone. On the other hand, he can move and keep listening to it, something he could not do if it was infrared."
5,Headphones that sounds and fits good,The earphones fit very well and is easily rechargeable. The sound has better quality and is ideal for listening to all my electronics .
2,crush the skull,"When I got these headphones, the first thing I did was test them for comfort. Very tight. No adjustment made them better. Obviously, they didn't really crush my skull, but they were so tight that I could not wear them for 15 minutes. I'm a male with an average-large head size, so some folks might not have the same problem. I did not have the nerve to give these a one-star rating because the sound might be great. I did not even finish unpacking everything. Sent them back disappointed. I'm surprised that this manufacturer of good reputation could not make these headphones more comfortable."
3,Midling sound quality,"I was hoping these headphones would give clear and responsive reception without wires. What I got was comfortable headphones with fair sound which gets high levels of static with distance, forget about thru plaster walls. Delivery and price from Amazon were very good. Its a shame that they will soon start charging sales tax in PA."
2,Yikes--tough read.,"I thought that the author uncovered some interesting 'side' stories to the drama that was the 1951 National League season. Prager's inclusion of the tragic electrician who suffered physically and morally as he listened to his Dodgers come undone was extremely interesting. But, the style of writing was horrendous. All I wanted was an interesting read to get me ready for baseball season. It is really a chore to read through this book. As stated in earlier reviews it is way to verbose."
2,The Echoing Green,"The book is very interesting because of the subject, but it is over-written, and the writing gets in the way of the material."
2,"Usable, but not great for unhappy cats","Got this to take my cats to the vet. The only real problem is that they could escape unless the zippers were held tightly by hand.Pros:-Lightweight, collapsable design is easier to store than hard plastic case-Washable liner providedCons:-The zipper and clasp closure leaves enough room for my cats to stick their heads out. If they push hard enough, they can loosen the zippers and jump all the way out-Stitching has started to fray even after light use (probably only 5 times in the past 4 years).Not recommended for cats! If you have a dog, this may not apply."
5,"Remastered ""NINE"" is a ""TEN""!!!","Phenominal! The remaster of ""NINE"" blows the original master out of the water with it's expanded booklet with pictures and its expansion to two CDs with more music and bonus tracks. If you own the original master and are hesitant to buy the remaster, trust me- the 12+ minute track of ""The Grand Canal"" alone makes the purchase worth it! I can't see the CD of the revival cast surpassing this (Antonio WHO?!). Don't hesitate, buy the remaster NOW!!!"
4,Raul Julia at his sexiest!,"This a show that was a case of either you love it or hate it. I loved it because I was lucky enough to see the actual show. You have to be in tune with both the characters, and really understand the music. Bottom line the 'in remarks'. The music and story line are difficult to imagine in ones head because its a visual that then sticks in your head. It first came out twenty years ago and it still in my head. That must say something about it. Tommy Tune was one of the top choreogragher of his time.Its a pity that more people don't revive GOOD shows!"
4,Hold off on purchasing until the remaster comes!,"I absolutely adore Maury Yeston's score for the Tony Award winning musical ""Nine"". The music is lovely and the lyrics are both funny and poignant, and the score contains such wonderful songs as ""Be Italian"", ""The Grand Canal"", ""Unusual Way"", ""A Call from the Vatican"", ""My Husband Makes Movies"", and others too numerous to name. Raul Julia, Karen Akers, Anita Morris especially stand out with dynamic performances.Having said that, I have to advise against getting this CD. The reason? Columbia/Legacy is remastering this CD in the spring of 2003 to coincide with the 2003 revival. The remaster will have TWO CDs, much more music, and bonus tracks! Fans of the show should rejoice! I suggest that you wait until the 2003 remaster to come out to fully appreciate the wonderful score of ""Nine""."
1,SWAG! gone bad!,Loved it. It stopped working on Dec 29 :( Not sure if its a battery or the quality of the actual watch. Returning it.
3,Great Service!,"Although I did not like the watch for me but customer service was awesome, I did buy some other watch from same seller!"
3,Alright,This book is very small. It gives a brief description of each of the major breeds of seahorses. I was hoping for more specific and detailed information for those of us who want to learn to raise them. You also definately need an additional saltwater aquarium book.
3,dry reading,"the book was rather dry reading, but held lots of info. I suggest getting other books and using this as a second read...It made me NOT want to set up a tank."
3,It was just ok,"It was an informative book, and it helped prepare my 4 year old for his surgery, but he preferred ""Tubes in My Ears: My Trip to the Hospital"""
4,Cute but not quite as pictured,Got this for my 5 month old for valentines since it is a flower i thought it was cute and my daughter loves anything she can chew on. The stitching looks a little looser than some of her cloth toys so i would definitely keep an eye on it with her. It also doesn't stay up nice as pictured. The flower part slides all over the ring (very loosely attached to the ring) which is kind of annoying.
5,The new Bible for baseball's beginnings,"This book makes all the other books on baseball's origins obsolete. Not only meticulously researched and - more importantly - referenced, ""Baseball Before We Knew It"" cuts through the confusion, usually involving inaccurate references and / or researchers who had already made their mind up before doing the research. No other book charts baseball's origins so completely and without assumption and preconception. Anyone interested in the subject should read it."
1,This is for people with big noses.,"If you have perfect or near proportional nose, do not bothering getting these generically sized ones. Go to the dealer yourself and have it adjusted to your face. These generic models assume that everyone has either a big nose or a really wide nose."
4,Looking for extra large item.,"I recently lost my 12 year old Ray Ban's while in Hawaii. Could not find the right size in stores. While these say they are extra large, I found that the width was fine, however the length (temple piece) was still too short."
3,A little to bleak for me,"Whereas I respect Bruce for creativity sake, this album is a bit to depressing for me on a regular basis. You basically get just guitar, vocals, and harmonica. To listen to this over the course of 40 minutes is not an easy chore. The lyrics are heartfelt though which is alot more than I can say for anything that has come out in the last few years."
4,For TRUE Springsteen fans only,"This album is for true fans only...It was recorded basically in a farm house with an acoustic guitar and a 4-track cassette recorder but the quality of lyrics are SO Springsteen; so stark and simple yet the complexity of the story-telling is truly Springsteen. From the title song ""Nebraska"" to the beautiful ""Mansion on a Hill"" each song tells a story in only Springsteen's style. ""Johnny 99"" is haunting tale of desperation and every man's thoughts and fears. ""My Father's House"" is a lonely tale weaved between thorns and lonliness. ""State Trooper"" and ""Highway Patrolman"" obviously bring thoughts of Springsteen's anguish in his past to song. But in the end, Springsteen does bring a ray of hope through ""Reason to Believe.""I love this album - it forces you to be introspective in a high quality, Springsteen kind of way."
3,The Double Ceoss System 1939 - 1945,This book is strickly utilitarian. If your looking for thrills this is not the book. If your interested on how the system works this is the book.
3,Pretty Good Board Game,"Pretty good game, but probably more ideal for older crowd (i.e. in their 40s and 50s). I was born in the 80s, so a lot of the commercials referenced were before my time."
3,Good game if you remember slogans,"I had the original version of Adverteasing when it came out in the 80s. Glad they updated it. I also have the second edition released in the 90s that has some questions like ""Name three drugstore chains."" It adds to the challenge. If you're good at remembering slogans, this game is for you. My game group play this game in teams, since sometimes two or three heads are better than one."
3,Beware - not gluten free!!!,The ingredients listed on this item were not correct. The product I received contained wheat protein and is not gluten free.
2,nothing that hasnt been done better before,"as someone else stated, FOB and panic! at the disco have done this type of thing before, and with better results. The lyrics arent nearly as catchy as FOB's on Infinity on High (or any other album for that matter) and then music isn't as 'big' as on panic's cd, so why waste your time? unless you are an absolute pop/punk scene fanatic there is no reason to own this, your other cd's will get more play than this for sure. Try All Time Low, remind me of these guys a little bit but they are better."
5,Are you the new boss of your hospital's case management department?,Then this book is written just for you. This book has most of the ingredients for redesigning your case management department. The only thing missing is administrative support and a backbone...
5,Golden guide for everyone! Its title reflects it well.,"The writings in this book are droplets of perfect wisdom and sincerity. If we can apply those criteria in our lives, not only the world would be like a paradise for everybody, but also we will have the eternal paradise. The audience of the book is everybody who wants to have happiness both in this world and in eternal world."
4,Makes Great Donuts,"This donut cutter makes great donuts. It cuts the dough easily. The only reason I gave it four stars is the fact that it is a little flimsy. Even though it is thin, it works well. It does what it is supposed to do, (cut donuts.)I would buy it again."
3,"Useful, but limited","This is a very good guide to Egypt in that it gives an excellent historical account of the culture of the Nile. However, outside of Cairo, the practical information is very patchy and generally misleading. Within Cairo, the guide provides detailed maps, excellent recommendations on accomodations, sights, museums, restaurants. If only this were titled the Blue Guide to Cairo, since its section on Cairo is the only one that shines. The guide provides very little information on transportation and accomodation in cities and smaller locales outside of Cairo. Recommended, as long as you know its limits and do not rely on it outside of the major metropolitan areas."
2,A disappointment,"I'm a fan of the Blue Guide series but found this volume to be a disappointment. From the title, I should have been aware that a lot of it is taken up with Cario. The print is very small & so are the maps. The index uses alternative spellings , not the most common terms, which makes it very difficult to use. I was quite disappointed in it & considering the high price, could not recommend it."
4,"Great Player, Sonicstage is awful...","First, all those people that say it takes for ever to scroll through the music are just wrong. I have nearly 10k songs on the device and it scrolls through the music faster than an IPOD, which I also own.It is better functionally than the IPOD, although it lacks in add-ons (except for the remote which is far better than anything by Apple).Now the downside. Sonicstage is just awful. It is glitchy, the major one being that for no reason it can stop working and nobody at Sony can figure out how to fix it. The program is very cumbersome, you can configure your music, but it is a royal pain. Although I am not a big fan of I-Tunes, it is far superior to Sonicstage. I would buy it over an IPOD for the device is better, but be very leary of the Sony software, it sucks. I think the industry is missing the boat on forcing you to use there interfaces rather than a third party's (i.e. Microsoft's)."
4,Hardware cloth,"This roll of hardware cloth is just what I needed to keep woodchucks from digging up under my raised beds. The only issue I had was the size of the roll (length and height), which was not stated in the product description. I emailed, but the one reply I got misstated inches for feet--a BIG mistake. I decided to take a chance, based on the product's weight, and am happy with my purchase. Better buy here than anywhere else, and FREE shipping!"
4,"A thorough, technical, but fairly easy to understand book on the brain & how it works.","This book, while very technical, is fairly easy to understand, and is very thorough in the area of research into the brain's neurotransmitters how they work, and how they affect you in every aspect, everyday, and how to recognize if they are not working just right.I have not yet fully followed the dietary programs offered in the book, to ""balance my brain"" so I cannot report on whether or not they helped me, but they seem to make alot of sense."
5,Just what i was looking for,Was looking for some help quitting Wellbutrin and this has plenty of natural ways to boost dopamine that i have NOT found searching online. Very well done.
1,Total waste of money,"As soon as I listened to this CD while driving to work this morning, I thought ""Oh well, I just threw some money down the toilet with this CD"".I have almost every Elias album out there--> seen her many times etc... This is definitely her most boring, bland, perhaps commercial CD out there. It's extremely dissapointing and frankly perplexing to see how such an incredible musician can turn out such boredom."
5,A wonderful and warm,"I loved this series. If anything I'd have liked it to have been longer to allow more character development in the supporting cast and really hope they go back and do a second series for it. I want to know what happens to these characters. I was very sad it ended so soon.I think it would be fine for the whole family really though there is a bit of fan-service, guns, gender questions, and the age difference may be disturbing for some. It's all very respectful though and sweet and melancholy.Though for the life of me I've still not figured out the title ""I My Me Strawberry Eggs""...And as always... please what anime in Japanese with subtitles. Don't watch the dubbed version."
3,Disco influence evident,"I've been an ELO fan for twenty years and was fortunate enough to attend a concert of the new ELO when it toured America a few years ago. Secret Messages is an excellent album but it is obviously influenced by the disco movement. My favorite tracks from this album are, Secret Messages, Losers Gone Wild, and especially Four Little Diamonds. You won't be disappointed if you chose this album, but it is not definitive ELO."
5,Black Market better than Super Black Market,"This is the one I had been looking for. I used to have the album, then I sold it and thought I was buying it on cd but bought Super Black Market Clash. The songs are not the same. Bank Robber is hashed up on Super. It is much better on this one."
5,GE is making a fortune,In 2008 these bulbs were $2.50 or $3.00 in the stores. Now it seems GE needs your money to build more ugly bird-killing windmills. Maybe I bought enough to leave some in my will. Hopefully the Bulb Police won't knock at my door before I croak.The 15 watt filament usually blows first. You can transfer the bulb over to another fixture where 135 watts will work and grab another 3-way.Thinking about a 3-way LED? Don't bother. Maybe someday. The customer is losing control of one market after another.
1,Brilliant film - terrible transfer,"This is a great movie, probably Godard's best. But I'm afraid that the transfer to DVD by Fox Lorber is very poor. It's got a very soft, almost pixillated look with a lot of strobing on panning shots. At the cinema, Pierrot le Fou is one of the most colourful, vibrant films ever , but this DVD has a sad washed-out, de-saturated, dirty look and the sound level is also very low. All in all, it's a great shame that one of the classics of modern cinema has been treated with such a lack of care... I would recommend that you wait for a decent label to release this film properly. I have to say that it's made me wary of all titles on Fox Lorber now."
2,eh.,"I used to be a Juggalo for a while but then the stupid ""new age"" Juggalos have had to come in and F things up for the rest of us who know the TRUE meaning of a Juggalo. With that said, I have loved virtually every ICP CD thus far, but this one is just pure crap. I don't care of Lo's or Lette's want to get on my case for saying this review, let's face it, ICP is freaking mad awesome, but this CD does not prove it. I have been a fan of ICP since '96, but this ain't cuttin' it!!"
2,"Just release a Single CD for ""Rollin Over""","Because thats the only good song on here. Ive been down with these guys forever, but they have really dissapointed me with their last two LPs. They got to grow up at some point. All their immature sh*t sounds the same."
3,The new production is quite good,First off I was at one point a huge fan of ICP and I have heard damn near everything they have released and with the exception of 90% of the Bizare albums I have been down with there sound for better or worse. Though as of late Twiztid has out done ICP on every turn I can't help but feel that this album marks a positive turning point for Joe & Joey. The new production on this joint is interesting and a welcome break from all of the copy catesque garbage most hip-hop fans are suffering through right now and as always violent J is on point lyrically. For some strange reason this album reminds me of the high points of Tunnel Of Love. Worth the money and long live anybody who goes tooth for tooth angainst Feminem and spanks his little blasphemous rappin on Tupac's music (...)
4,Improvement from Hell's Pit,"First off, I'm a die hard fan. I thought Hell's Pit was the beginning of the end for ICP. Hell's Pit was a disaster in my opinion, with much of the blame on the lack of Mike E. Clark. So when this EP was announced and they had NO producer, I thought it was going to be even worse.To my surprise, its actually damn good. Definitely not their best, but a step in the right direction. The beats and music/samples are much better. All the tracks are solid, but not one really stands out like a ""Superballs"" or ""Cemetary Girl"". I'd put it up their with Beverly Kills.Please bring back Mike E. Clark!!!!!!!"
3,Exercise mat is OK but not great,"I bought this mat about 7 weeks ago. The mat is OK, not great. It works fairly well on a hard wood or tile floor because it is so soft and spongy but I prefer a firmer base to exercise on. If I had known how spongy it was, I would not have purchased it."
5,Awesome product!,"I started an aerobics class and we have to get down on the floor to do part of the exercises. I first tried a yoga mat and that did not offer enough padding. I then bought this mat and it is great! Nice thick pad, easy to carry. Another women in the class has one and says she's been using hers for about 4 years...still looks like new. (Of course, I didn't ask her how MUCH she's used it in that 4 years. :-) ) Bottom line....good buy for the bucks."
4,Exercise Mat,I really like the Harbinger 340400 3 part Exercise Mat. It's comfortable. I was just exercising on the floor for back pain. This makes it much nicer.
3,Defective unsupported carrying handles,"[[ASIN:B004KQZON8 Harbinger Tri-Fold Mat (24"" x 60"")]]This mat has adequate insulation for floor exersizes. It's casingis a thin vinyl type cover which is just OK. The weak point are the lifting handles, which after a few months use,are tearing away from its stitching onto the cover. This is leaving the insulation exposed. The defect is most likely due to the lack of proper support design where the handles are sewn onto the thin casing.Amazon only backs up their warranty for 30 days; so I contacted the manufacturer with an explanation of the problem. Their answer was a flat no. It's out of warranty, ""we can do nothing for you.""You be the judge. Let the buyer beware. WAB Florida"
5,Excellent product.,Was well pleased with the quality of this product. Would recommend it and have done so. It was quite sturdy and soft at the same time. The delivery was sooner than expected. Amazon is most reliable.
2,cant say its the pads fault,I bought these to replace my Air Brace pads for judo as they got good reviews. I only wore one a few times when I sustained an injury to my knee. Bad luck perhaps as I never had this happen with my old pads but it makes you wonder. Perhaps I should have spent the extra money and replaced my knee pads with the same ones I was always using.They are pretty comfortable and slim. Probably just a freak accident I suppose.
3,Not Bad,"The game overall is not bad.The Good-The Feeling of a Medieval game-Alot of Tech and upgrades-Details of cities, walls, trees, and riversThe Bad-Poor graphs, (altho it was released in the early 2000 so go figure)-Hard to get Money/Gold-Hard to get Food-Battle is not exciting-Slow paced at the StartThe Ok-The Castle was not called a Keep or a stronghold, the history was not correct-Instead of moving troops and to attack, you have to build a camp for the troops, which held a Max of 250 troops, (which is not a lot)-build was fast, but it i couldn't repair until a battle was over"
3,Great MP3 player in certain situations,"Ive had this mp3 player for about a year now. It has many pros and cons.Pros:Touchscreen20 gbeasy-to-use softwarecomes with charger, soft case, etc.Cons:BigHard to find a song when you have a lot on itCant get very loudTo my knowledge, Olympus hasnt made any cases or other accesoriesCamera has very low mpBottom Line:For around $200, its worth it but if you want something user friendly, stick with an Ipod."
3,Cooks hot,"I've used this 4 times now and I'm fairly happy with it. It still takes some getting used to. My old slow cooker was a smaller one so the larger size might be contributing to my issues. It seems that a recipe that should take 8 hours only takes 6. The warm setting is nice but be warned that food continues cooking. So a roast that I set on 6 hours was done nicely at 6 hours but the meat was quite dry after sitting on warm for a couple more hours. I've done a Swedish meatball recipe (and it was toast), cooked whole chicken (very nicely cooked), a large roast (well done), and a medium roast (over well done).I think I will have better luck with something with more liquid - chili for instance.I'm happy with the unit itself - there isn't any unpleasant odor or any of the other problems associated with other units from the reviews I've read here."
5,Michael Bolton Rocks!,"Yeah, Michael Bolton's 1983 album for Columbia records rocks! This is not the same music most people know Bolton for. On here, he sounds like an arena rocker that would appeal to fans of groups such as Foreigner, Journey, Loverboy, Bryan Adams, etc, more than the soft rock crowd. Fools Game, the albums lead off track is a great song. Really only one of the many great songs on this album. It's too bad, that the people who would enjoy this album, would be the same people, who probably wouldn't go near a Michael Bolton cd."
2,Not a book to learn from,"Dr. Chou suffers from the same problem as does Dr. Wangsness (of E&M fame): he gets lost in mathematical formulation while not elucidating on important principles. Especially bad is the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian chapter, which is rather incomprehensable unless it is already understood by the reader, at which point it is superfluous."
4,perfect for travel...,"i think this little bag is perfect for air travel. it will hold my money, credit cards and my flight information. the leather is nice and soft...i like it!"
3,just what I needed,I was looking for a small shoulder bag that I could stick in my backpack and pull out when I need to walk around the city. This works great!
1,This book is too small,This book is too small to have any information about astral projection. The information in this book can be found in any book that is around 200 pages.
1,Not what I thought it would be,"I loved the first Yoga Zone series and have even taped the televison show. I bought this based on the title (sounded relaxing) and because I thought it would be nice to have some shorter tapes. I didn't find this tape to be very relaxing like the first series. It's just and episode of the televison series, but not at all what the title implied. I won't be buying anymore of this series, I can tape them off of TV for free. I hope when they release a new series it's more like the first one, but some shorter tapes would be nice when you don't have an hour to do a tape."
3,The Dominate Beast,"In my review of the UFC..I have to admit after re-watching theses early classics...They turned out to be better and a lot more fun to watch. This casual fan looks forward to seeing more of the early classics.That being said Aside from the return and dominace of the Beast Dan Severn..The So called Super fight of Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock..I have to admit that after a long 31 mintue match...it was stuff like this that made me say UFC was BORING and puts you to sleep in the first place when I did my first Review.The match was sad and not what the fans at the time thought it would be.It was more exciteing listening to the Ref...Say ""Are you ready, Are you Ready? Let's Get On!!! thru out the DVD.This UFC is ok if you want to add to your collection."
4,Interesting if overly sentimental.,"For all its faults, Very Special People is still a very readable, personable book. Cloyingly sentimental, it still has its charming moments. A good book for youngsters, but able to appeal to adults as well."
2,Buy a smaller sliding miter saw instead,"Purchased this 12"" compound miter saw on the reccomendation of a friend and I regret that now. The saw itself is ok. It is easy to adjust, smooth to use, and has plenty of power to cut framing lumber. However, I find this saw to be WAY too big for my needs. Iyt is big, very heavy, and the base is very deep making it hard to fit on a miter saw stand. Instead I wish I had bought an 8"", or perhaps 10"", compound SLIDING miter saw.I bought the reconditioned saw (no longer available at this time) and after a few weeks, mind has developed a bad crack in the cast aluminum base. I haven't fingiured out what I am going to do with that yet - presumably bring it to dewalt for repair. In any case, I would not buy this saw again."
2,you expect so much more,"If this is going to be your first encounter with Bane, do yourself a favor and start with either ""Give Blood"" or ""It All Comes Down To This."" Hell, go for both if you can. I listened to this CD and was not intrigued some of the tracks. The sound has somewhat lightened, as some know that Bane's music always comes close to brutal. Their message is still there and that's why I gave them at least 2 stars. But, since I bought this at one of their shows, I can't even force myself to listen to this CD. Some of the songs are just boring and I'm glad I haven't been to a show where they play their new stuff. I kind of just bought the CD because I love these guys, but I surely don't listen to it."
5,Hardcore will never die,"This CD is just great. The mainstream can listen to Underoath, Senses Fail, My Chemical Romance, and all the other post-hardcore bands (which are good and I enjoy them), but this is pure hardcore, and this hardcore will never die. Hardcore is popular now in the mainstream and it will fall off the mainstream radar, but it will never die, because of artists like this coming out with good old hardcore albums like this. Bane is one of the greats and will stay one of the greats with albums like this."
1,Do not waste your time!,"Very disappointing, the trailer really fools you. Never mind not wasting your money, your time is better spent on doing anything else but watching this movie."
2,Different,Not what I thought it was going to be; not my type of movie but I'm sure many will like it.
1,secrets of self storage marketing success by fred gleeck,I HAVE READ A-LOT OF BOOKS ON MARKETING BUT THIS BOOK IS SO BAD IT WAS LIKE BURNING MY OWN CASH. ITS SO BAD YOU SHOULD BUY IT JUST TO SEE (UNREAL) IT WILL NOT BE AROUND LONG.
3,(Unintentionally) Hilarious,"My roommate rented this film from the library on a military base and I watched it with him. It has everything that makes great camp; bad acting, a plot that resembles a pasta strainer, juvenile dialogue, and audio/visual effects that simply bogle the mind. It would be absurd to take this movie seriously. It's only redeeming value is that it's hilariously bad. My roomate and I couldn't help laughing at this piece. Frankly, for $.95 used, I recommend having a beer and giving it a watch."
3,Good but not the best,"This is undoubtedly the best CS2K reference currently available. Developers will love it because it has numerous code examples and fully explores the CS2K objects. However, most of the examples are culled straight from the retail site and sitelets that ship with CS2K so from that aspect it is disappointing; these sites have received almost widespread criticism on the Commerce Server newsgroups for being hard to customise and for a chronic mix of HTML and ASP code (as a test, try giving them to your HTML designer to customize!). A more advanced and flexible example site, the flagship MS B2C Reference Architecture based on XML and XSLT isn't even mentioned which is a big disappointment."
4,Good Book.,"This is a good point to start developing applications based on Commerce Server. Don't think it's an absolutely complete solution to CS2K issues, but it covers all the topics and it's useful. Better than Help files and CS2K Resource Kit."
5,As Good as the First in the Series!,"Millions of dollars, a new best friend, two men wanting to marry her, and a great dog! Well, all that is left is a mystery. Honey is back and better than ever. With her friend Janie, Honey is out to solve her biggest mystery yet. Where is her loyal accountant, fiance and her four million dollars? While trying to solve the mystery she travels through a hurricane, tornado and then off to London. While on her journey she is followed by a great new character/ P.I named Sledge Hamra. Is he what he says he is? Or should she be a bit worried? This is a fun and endearing mystery. With each addition to the ""Honey"" series the reader grows to love Honey and her friends more. Enjoy!!"
3,Boring,"Seller did a great job with sending item quickly and service was excellent, its just that the DVD itself was boring Kids didnt like it"
4,"As It Is Within, So It Is Without","This book can be condensed to one sentence: as it is within, so it is without. That is one of the principles in the Hermetic, written by Thoth, long before any of the eggheads in our modern scientific community were hatched.Who would have thought that Spiritual Laws, thousands of years old and present in most Eastern philosophies, would be proven scientifically by quantum mechanics! It's very refreshing to see members of the scientific community embracing this change of paradigm - that we create our own reality, whatever reality is. I admit that i don't know.Thanks David Darling. It's not easy being a physicist when your belief system is not in line with conventional wisdom."
5,great product,"bought it for my husband and after the second use, he felt the difference. he will continue to use this product"
1,Programming With Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0,"I'm using the book as a text in a college class, and while the content is good, one can follow it coherently only if one also obsessively tends to watch such things at MTV. The book is exceedingly fragmented, and I've found it very obnoxious to be reading a tutorial and all of a sudden hit two pages of examples before you can get back to the text. I don't enjoy studying that way. If someone else can then, by all means. I am not finding it to be a pleasant experience, however. The layout could have been a lot better."
5,Stern at his best`,"Stern's playing of the second movement of no. 2 is so wonderful that he even outshines Heifetz's version. I never thought I'd ever say that because I'm a Heifetz ""worshiper.""G. Miller"
3,"It's okay... works, but the taste is not very good.","I prefer another brand that has a black cherry flavor. This isn't impossible to eat, but it's not very good, which makes it hard to actual eat every time."
4,"Chalky, have to eat a lot of them",Improves digestion. Lessens impact of emanations. Takes a lot of pills to work.
5,The most inspiring book I've ever read!,"As an 18 year old college freshman, I was required to choose a self help book to read for my Health class. I chose Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul because it looked more interesting than anything else I could find. And am I glad I made that decision! This is by far the most inspiring set of stories for teenagers out there! I immediately bought a copy of Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II and Chicken Soup for the Christian Soul! I'm addicted to these wonderful books. Definitely a breath of fresh air in a somewhat ""whirlwind-type"" society!"
5,"great book, sad but good",This is a great book I am in 5th grade and every time a teacher reads it the teacher and most of the class crys. It sooths you're soal and in some stories it also gives you a message to live by like don't drink and drive or fullfill you're dreams while you still can.
5,AWESOME BOOK FOR A TEEN!!!,"THIS BOOK WAS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VE READ... MY ALL TIME FAVORITE STORY WAS CALLED, HERO OF THE HOOD... (IT WAS IN THE SECOND BOOK THO.) IT WAS ABOUT A BOY THAT NEVER GAVE UP HOPE EVEN WHEN THINGS GOT REALLY TOUGH...THE BOOK MAKES YOU THINK TWICE ABOUT ALOT OF ORDINARY THINGS."
4,Very well put together,"I thought that this book was full of interesting, compelling, and heart- warming stories. The one that touched me the most was the story contributed by Bill Cosby about his son. The only reason that my rating is not a ten is because some of the stories were a little cheesy."
4,Chicekn soup isnt just for a cold!,"When i sat down to read chicken soup for the teenage soul i gfigured it would be something written for younger teenagers. Myself being a 19yr old college student i didnt think i would like it. Well let me tell you i was tottaly wrong. Within the first half hour of reading this book i determined it was perfect for me. I got to the point where i could not put this book down. The stories of the heart submitted by other readers touched my heart. Whether it was reading about young love or friendship wvery story related to my life in some way. Whether you are a teenager looking for a book, or a parent looking for a book for your teenager, i would highly recomend Chicken soup for the teenage soul!"
5,An inspirational book for teens,"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul is a great inspirational book for teenagers. This book was recommended to me by many of my friends. There are many stories in Chicken Soup that range from stories about relationships to tough stuff. I would recommend this book to most any teenager because you can really apply the situations to your life. One of my personal favorite stories was Lessons in Friendship. The story was about a teenage girl that was trying to figure out were she belonged and who her friends really were. This one particular story inspired me to be who I am and to do the best I can. I think all teenagers should have this first class book written by Jack Canfield, Mark Victor Hansen, and Kimberly Kirberger."
5,The Best Book Ever,"This book is a really good book. It teaches you and makes you understand mistakes made in life. I found that some of these stories are sad yet some are encouraging and humorous. If I would have to Recommend one story out of this book it would be ""Somebody Should Have Taught Him"", Because by the end of this story i was almost in tears. It was dealing with the truth of consequences of drunk driving. I think all teenagers should read this book and realize the importance of difficult matters in life."
5,more personal idea,"All the Chicken Soup books are very sweet. I gave my son this one and the one for college kids since he'll be there soon. He liked reading the intimate stories since he and his buddies don't tend to share that much with each other (boys!). But more personally meaningful to him was a copy of ""Words to Live By: A Journal of Wisdom for Someone You Love,"" that my wife and I filled out for him, with what we've learned from our own life experiences. It started some reallywonderful conversations. I highly recommend it."
2,Good only to depressed People,I read one story so far that stunk. My got happy cause she seen it Oprah. It was alright for depressed people.
5,"Chicken Soup On Teenage Soul : 101 of Life, Love and Learnin","On the day I have read this self-help book, I felt good because on the day, I'm feeling bad mood, in a sense that I don't feel like eating, don't feel like doing anything...until when I start reading, I feel totally good because it has self-help stories on Love, Life and Learning - as it says on the book and it has comics to lighten your day. If you want to buy self-help books, I suggest you buy this because it is suitable for teenagers."
3,Not impressed. Adhesive does not stick well.,"I thought this would be a good product for applying things like therapy magnets to the skin. Does not stick very well. I ordered some ""cheap"" adhesive patches from a magnet supply place, thinking they would suffice until this product arrived. The ""cheap"" patch is thinner, which I thought would be a ""minus"" but as it turned out, it sticks much better than this product."
1,Not available for Amazon Prime Subscribers,Why do I even pay for Amazon Prime if I do not get the benefits of watching each and every movie? I'm going to unsubscribe and stick with netflix and/or hulu plus.
1,not worth the time,"I'm surprised by the book especially after reading all the rave reviews. As my fellow reviewers have pointed out, there are only a few pointers the author keeps stressing: be loyal to a few companies and try to get people to give you free upgrades. Frankly, though the author claims that everyone can practise what he proposes, if you don't fly often enough, no airline employee is going to hand you free stuff. Plus, I find it hard to believe that you can request upgrades all the time. If everyone does that, who is going to pay for first class? You have to have a thick skin to do this all the time. I think the airlines/hotels might even have a remark under your name: 'ask for requests all the time, better give him or he'll call someone else'. People are probably providing you good service for all the wrong reasons."
1,If I could give it 0 stars I would,"Save your time & money and stay away from this book. If you really want to know what is in it here goes1. Be nice2. Be loyal3. Ask for upgrades (yeah right)Gimme a break. This book is full of useless information that may be pertinent for the traveler in like the 1960's. Speaking of the 60's, this book was published in 1999, I had to consider that before buying, but even in 1999, a rate for Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons was more than $125 a night (as the author states). I believe that the positive reviews are friends of the author himself. He should be ashamed. What a waste of paper."
2,Common Sense in bloated form,"Instead of any ""secrets"" to luxury travel the author simply repeats the same common sense ""if you just spend enormous amounts of money with travel providers and are nice to them, they'll be nice back"" Well Duh. Of course they're nice to someone who's flown 3 Million miles with them. What about the rest of us? Further, the author shamelessly shills for all the major airlines and outright bashes Southwest and other discounters. His plugs for Delta should win him free tickets for life.Save your money. This is a page of common sense jammed into 300 page plus tome that's not worth your time."
1,not worth the savings,"I bought these chipping hammers because they were so cheap, but they both fell apart the first day we used them and I had to run out and buy new ones and pay full price for the new ones. I bought a different brand instead and they seem to be holding up just fine. My fault, you get what you pay for."
1,IS RICK OVER THE HILL?,"This fourth entry in the DEATHSTALKER series marks the return of the original hero, Rick Hill. While Hill is looking remarkably fit for a middle-aged man, his performance is so lethargic it's a wonder why he even agreed to do it at all. Add the incredibly bad Maria Ford and others, and you get a really bad sword and sorceror flick that makes little if any sense. Only Brett Clark as the doofus hunk and Michelle Moffett as the evil queen come out with any semblance of acting ability. Little to recommend this clunker though!"
5,Spellbound,"History is incredibly rich, interesting, keeps you mesmerized ... only when it goes into print, it so often becomes boring, dead. If it comes to history, very, very few people have the gift to keep you on the edge of your chair while reading what they wrote ... one of them is Robert Hughes! His style is absolutely spell binding! Personally I don't like modern/contemporary art (the last chapter in this book), but I kept on reading about it, simply because it was written so well. Of course the book is carefully researched, there is all the information you could wish for, and yet, despite its volume, it is not a mere enumeration of isolated facts, events, historical data. Robert Hughes brings it all together like in a historical novel. Very rewarding! I do wish he would write about European art (medieval art, renaissance, baroque, romanticism etc.) the way he did about American Art."
1,Robert Hughes is way off-track,"As a young artist, I would like to take this global freedom of speech opportunity to say that Robert Hughes is the most opinionated old-school reviewer to ever try and take anything away from talented people he couldn't understand or dare appreciate. His reviews of Barnett Newman and Jean Michel Basquiat have to be read to be laughed-at. Who would think that a TIME magazine art critic could write so many books and even get his own tv series? A presentation and reasonable critique is one thing, but a narrow-minded opinion is another."
1,Kingston Brass faucet falls apart in less than 1 year. Lousy customer service,"In less than 1 year the porcelain buttons on the handles started to fall off. They replaced the first one, now a year later, the other one fell off and they want proof of purchase for the warranty and are giving me the run around. If I hadn't bought this cheap knock off, I wouldn't have to prove to them that I bought it! They don't answer their phones either.Kingston Brass KS4461BX Metropolitan Widespread Lavatory Faucet with Metal Cross Handle, Polished ChromeThe real faucets that they are knocking off with these buttons have them held on with screw down rings, not defective glue."
3,Average,"If you want a rapid review of every super bowl, then this DVD is a good purchase. However it was almost to rapid of a summary, just giving a few minutes to each game. All in all I would have to rate this as very ordinary. However I purchased the DVD fairly cheap, so it wasn't a total loss."
5,Favreau rocks,"I don't know how anyone can rate ""Made"" at one star. That's just insulting. It's extremely well written, directed and acted. Peter Falk was a great touch. Great cameos and awesome dialogue. Swingers is a great accomplishment for a low budget movie. I think that our mega-budget american directors would really be hard pressed to put together such a complete and well rounded movie... I look forward to anything favreau is envolved in in the future."
2,Sound Quality Lacking on This Boxed Set,"The sound of these cd's at least on my system was poor. It was a Christmas gift so I did not pay for it, but I would not buy this set or recommend it based on what I'm hearing. I own quite a few jazz box sets, and this one was the most expensive and disappointing."
2,Not your parent's Trouble!,purchased this toy believing it would be consistent with the game Trouble. Trouble is the bubble cracked after only two games and the character inserts for the pegs are flimsy cardboard. Very disappointing for our 3 year old.
2,Not worth getting.,"There is less than an hour of music on this disk.Serkin, as usual, plays straightforwardly; that's what makes his Beethoven sonatas so great. But any soloist in the 3rd cto has to play powerfully. Beethoven himself did.The Choral Fantasy is played well, but it's a bad work. I can't imagine anyone listening to it more than twice in a lifetime cf. the Triple Cto."
4,I don't care what anybody says...,"...My TV war library is incomplete without GARRISON'S GORILLAS, RAT PATROL, TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH, BLUE LIGHT (Robert Goulet), and McHALE'S NAVY (Ernest Borgnine)! How long will I have to wait for these?"
1,Don't waste your money.,"Yeah, sure. Your thinking what is there to lose for $.99, right? But then they stick you with the outragious shipping and handling charge. Which really, all they do is send it via USPS, which takes forever. When you get it, its all squished and dusty like somebody dragged it on the ground before sending it. Finally, when you open it and put the rubber case on, be careful it doesn't scratch your player in the process from all the dirt and dust that is impossible to remove. It is so flimsy it can rip very easily. How convenient is that? This is supposed to protect my player not make it worse. The clear cover for the screen? Thats a joke. It attracts dirt on the sticky side which also scratches the player. The belt clip, how does it work? It doesn't come off once its attached? This is awesome.If they really wanted to screw you they'd give you two of 'em."
1,"Great price for the skin, but the shipping?","This is precisely why ""caveat emptor"" is my byword on Amazon. How can you justify $6.99 shipping on a silicone case that weighs almost nothing?Always always check shipping for an item before you purchase!"
5,Sansa skins,"I am very happy with this purchase, and I received my Sansa skins very quickly. I would highly recommend this seller. The price is great as is the quality of the product."
5,fits well,Fits my sansa beautifully to provide protection; nice accesories but I don't use the belt holder or arm strap. I keep it on the string.
5,great deal,I only paid 99 cents for this product. It fits my sansa well and it comes with lots of extras. Maybe the best 99 cents I ever spent.
2,Not what I am used to,"I was very excited to purchase this Dynamic Health Cranberry juice concentrate, because the price was much better than what I had been paying. I have been using the Tree of Life brand and it is about twice as expensive as this brand. Unfortunately, this brand seems to be about 1/2 as concentrated and they must use some different process to make this product, as it tasted different as well. This brand reminded me more of a syrup. It doesn't have any added sugars or anything, but it is a lot less bitter than what I have come to expect (and like) from cranberry concentrate. I use cranberry concentrate to make cranwater for the fat flush diet plan and I didn't even finish the bottle of Dynamic Health brand. I recommend the Tree of Life brand if used for cranwater, or if you like the tangy bitterness of concentrated cranberries. This brand would be delicious over icecream."
4,not just for knitters,"I really enjoyed reading this little inspirational book . Susan puts into words the eternal questions , about love and loss of love, life and death (""how do we live in the presence of death?"")- A poetic and inspiring book. I was sad to find out after I started reading it that Susan had died of breast cancer shortly after the book was published, which made the book even more poignant reading for me. A good read - especially if you're into knitting and zen."
3,More Poet than Person,"Let me say first that I am a big fan of Jerry Herman's works. I love his musicals. And that is why I turned with interest to this book.It is an easy read. It is also an effusive read: Stephen Citron says vry little critical of Mr. Herman. He also goes into in-depth detail on the plot and action of every musical. Much more space is devoted to this than to the backstage developments of how the musical evolved, working with other in the theatre world, etc., and more more space than to Mr. Herman's personal life. It's like a 50s MGM technicular movie: all glossy little depth. Those who would be interested in this book already know the plots and actions of the musicals, and want something more. I was left wanting that ""more""."
1,save your money,"sorry people, I was not impresed. why not? poor camera angles, often impossible to see exactly what is being worked on, as well as the shot being blocked , often by the guy's hand! lighting is poor, quality is somewhat grainy, too many important steps are not well explained. The mechanic is the reason why my parents did not want me to take shop class in high school, this guy just does not articulate well what he is doing .that said, it is valuable to see the process, although I was expecting more ""tips & tricks""haven't seen the Hancock dvd, but hope it's better."
5,The Name of Luc and Ana's story is...,"I love this book too and have been looking for Ana's story. I finally found it. For every one who loves 'The Greek Bridegroom' the other sister's story is 'A Passionate Surrender.' Both, of course, by Helen Bianchin. Thought I'd pass this info on since alot of people have asked. Enjoy."
2,amusing but not engaging,"In this ""comic thriller,"" Chinese Gordon breaks into a lab to steal drugs and also takes valuable CIA papers on psychological warfare. I think that I was supposed to be rooting for Chinese and his gang against the evil US government. Halfway through the novel, I did not care for either the burglars or the CIA folks. The only characters I liked were Chinese's cat (Dr. Henry Metzger) and the security dog the gang stole. The animal parts did make me smile. I did not care enough to do more than skim the rest of the novel."
2,Stopped working.,"The radio was everything we wanted - small size, good design, accepted a second speaker and input from a Walkman. HD reception was fine, as was tone. Unfortunately, it stopped working after a week. Amazon and Gigabargain were excellent (so far). Gigabargain took it back even though it was a few days over their 30-day limit, and even sent me a prepaid UPS voucher. They have offered a replacement if it is still in stock or a full refund if it isn't. I just sent it back yesterday, so the final chapter isn't written yet, but so far I like the radio and love the service."
3,"Performs well, but bulky","The sound quality of this radio is quite good, although not significantly better than the conventional radios that we have. It has some difficulty picking up the HD transmission from stations that are 30-40 miles away, but picks up the conventional transmission of those stations with no problem. It is somewhat larger than I expected (about 11.5 cm H x 21.5 cm W x 13 cm D), but the biggest space hog is the huge transformer that comes with it, with a heavy-duty, bulky cord. The transformer must have capacity to support 20 times the power consumed by the radio. I wanted to set up the radio on a counter top, and the transformer must be on the counter top too, but it takes up too much space."
3,"confusion good, but not forever","I enjoyed the first 100 pages, and this novel offers expertly rendered setting (the rough side of Beijing) and characters. But if you want plot, the book teases you that a fascinatingly complex web will satisfyingly come together, but instead 'who did what to whom and so on' moves from mystery to incoherence and you just give up (I did after 250 pages)."
3,Not the best system!,"I have been using this system for four months now and I would not recommend it! First of all the car seat base is horrible and never seems to be in tight enough even when my husband does it if wiggles around. Also most of the time it take 3 or 4 trys to get the car seat to lock into the base and that only is if the sunshade doesn't fall underneath the thing! The stroller on the other hand isn't too bad it turns very nicely and rolls good, the drink holders aren't that great because they aren't big enough to even hold a Dunkin Donuts cup of coffee! We have already bought our daughter a convertible carseat because I don't want to mess around with this one anymore! If you want my opinion go for something else, we won't be using this system with our next child."
3,Microwave Convection Oven Cookbook,This book arrived on time and it has some interesting recipes but I expected more than are offered in this recipe book.
4,A bit better than Normal,"This is a great CD with some upbeat pop tracks (Ladyshave, Starlovers), tripy stuff (Teenage Sensation), sort of funk (Blue Mug, Love vs Hate) and two very beautiful songs, Bambi and Dominique. Bambi has echoes of Morcheeba's ""Rome Wasn't Built In A Day"" but this is a more subtle song. This CD will never go down as one of the great albums of all time but it is a little piece of buried treasure worth unearthing."
3,Difficult second album test passed,"Normal for Gus Gus is very weird for us. But that only helps the music. From songs like 'Ladyshave' you can hear the group have lost none of their touch since their last album, 'Polydistortion'.A much more complex album in comparison to the often barren soundscape of 'Polydistortion', this album however does lack some consistency when you compare it to its predecessor. Nonetheless, a good follow up."
3,Nothing like the example,"Although this is a lot of fun, it didn't turn out anything like a turtle. I was really disappointed, as this was a gift for a friend."
3,fun and funky bag,"this is a really fun bag that gets a lot of attention when you carry it. i gave it to my sister as a gift and she gets asked regularly where she got it. one issue i had was that it was much bigger than i thought it was going to be, but it was still very cute."
4,Decent mirror,"This is a good mirror and one of the few CIPA mirrors that comes in white. I'd like it if it came with a clamp that works on a rounded windshield and would also like it if it had a hand adjustment that tightened it to keep it in place instead of having to use a phillips screwdriver. Aside from those things, it can be fashioned into several different positions (above or below the window) and it gives a clear view of the area behind the boat."
3,"ah,,,,not terrible","I'm put off not by the technical chops but by the lack of anything more than type writer klick-it-y-klack...and the Tunes?What I wanted was beautiful melodies, hip changes, daring reharm, swing and bravado,,,mostly got major scale swagger.still, the contents will interest the guitar nerd(me) and the production values are high. But you might disagree entirely; you might hate Bireli Lagrene or Joe Pass or Barny Kessel or Mr. Farlow who was warm, funny and generous. And it always came through in his playing. I'll trade my copy.And Mr Bruno is far better in other things."
5,My 1-year-old loves this book,"This is a fun, charming, wonderfully illustrated book for children with a mother and father. One half of the book is Mommy Loves her Baby; you flip the book over and start at the other side for Daddy Loves his Baby.My 1-year-old loves pointing to all the bright illustrations of animals. My 3-year-old chants along with the last line, ""Mommy loves her baby, and you know why this is true? Cause her baby is the sweetest little, cutest little you!"""
2,Not worth the money,"This is one of those cases where a product does two things and neither of them well. The GPS is adequate, although you should not even consider trying to use it as a replacement for an in-car navigation system. The interface is slow and difficult to use. The radio, while powerful, is difficult to hear if there is any kind of background noise. Even the sound of the wind outside the car with the windows rolled up can prevent clear communication. For the money, you could buy some decent 5W walkie-talkies and a moderately priced gps unit and be much better off."
4,An excellent historical romance set during the Amer. Rev.,"This is a well-crafted romance set during the American Revolution. Many of the characters are actual historical figures doing precisely what they did during the early 1780s.The story revolves around the actual Francis Marion, nicknamed by the British ""the Swamp Fox."""
1,DON'T WASTE THE MONEY!!!!!!!,"I bought this, thinking it would be fun, but it is a huge waste of money. trust me, buy a good ten dollar text messager that really WORKS AND IS EASY AND FUN!! FOR THIS, YOU HAVE TO TAKE TWENTY MINUTES WRITING, HEY, WHAT'S UP? AND THEN, YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE CHIP TO YOUR FRIEND!! how on earth are you supposed to do that unless you're right by each other, i mean, what school doesn't have teachers in the hallway to stop you? ugh, WASTE!! if you have time to hand her the chip, u have time to talk."
4,It's O.K...,"I had got this for me and my ""Friend"". It is cool but...IT IS A PAIN IN THE NECK! IT IS REALLY HARD TO SAVE A MESSAGE,IT IS SMALL AND EASY TO LOSE AND WHAT IS THE POINT!?In the time you give the tiny chip to the person, you could tell him yourself. It's nice though."
2,Confused,"Well, at first I wanted FriendChips, but now my friend and I have drawn up interesting points.----You have to type the message on one chip, give the chip to your friend, and have your friend type a new message. Why can't you just walk up to your friend and ask or say what you wanted to say?----Also, do the chips have a certain amount of storage space? It can hold up to a certain amount of messages right? Or do all the previous messages get erased? What if you wanted to read the previous messages?This device seems very stupid and not sensible, so I do not want it now."
3,Great Product but Unsteady for 2 year old,My 2 1/2 year old tried to used this swing yesterday for the first time. She immediately flipped backwards. For some reason it's very hard for her to balance herself on this seat.
1,It's not like new it's took bad,It's not like new it's took bad How said it's like new when i got the book it's very bad :(
1,Great book but greedy association,This book is a free book because it's no longer covered by copyright. Why are these companies charging people so much? Amazon should not allow companies to sell books that are on the public domain and which families do not gain from! Greed. Do not buy it. I read it from the digital library of the University of Pennsylvania. You can too!
5,Zanzibar,"This is the classic account of life inside the family of an Arab ruler on the island of Zanzibar in the mid-19th century. If the topic interests you, there is nothing else equal to it."
4,Upstaged by the Bootleg Series,"This set was an important release back in 1985 but in the wake of this decade's Bootleg Series it seems rather pointless. The set should become a collecters' item (by being deleted). In its place should be a new CD containing all the 'bootleg' BIOGRAPH cuts (in chronological order) plus more unrelesed gems. Perhaps two CDs worth? All real fans of Dylan are aware of the large number of outtakes still unreleased from the FREEWHEELIN', ANOTHER SIDE, 1965-66, AND BLOOD sessions. BIOGRAPH should in fact now become: THE BOOTLEG SERIES Volumes 5-7."
2,"Good for questions, little else","Why can't someone make a good chemistry GRE review book? This one is rife with errors, obsolete questions, and has the test format wrong (too many questions per a given period of time). The answers are helpful, but for many I ended up having to look them up anyway. And when I say errors, I mean many errors which will have you scratching your head to answer a question only to realize the right answer does not exist, as it is obscured by a typo. Occasionally their answers are scientifically incorrect as well.That said, this book has some value, but mostly if you've already reviewed the material and are simply looking to practice.All and all, it might be worth the money to have some extra practice problems. But this book is good for little else. You'll need textbooks."
1,Do not buy this book...,"...if you have any affection for the original book or any respect for your child's intelligence. It is an offensively dumbed-down version of the classic. The soul and substance of this book have been surgically removed, the language simplified to second grade level, and the real-life messages and values so memorably presented by the original simply DELETED. The illustrations are of stiffly drawn, misproportioned coloring book figures. It is well worth waiting a couple years until your child is ready to read and enjoy and learn from the original version."
2,This is a SIMPLIFIED VERSION and not the original.,"Be aware that this is a SIMPLIFIED VERSION and not the original text. The original (which ...(this website) also sells) is much richer & more interesting; Ms. Dodge wrote it for the grade-school kids of the 1860s; my sibs & I enjoyed it as grade school kids in the 1950s; in my opinion, it is accessable to the grade-school kids of today. I'd give the original 5 stars."
5,The Prodigal Son,"It was in very good condition. I really enjoy this story because to me this says it all. My favorite parable.It was sent well-packaged, arrived fast, and a great price. Thanks. Kudos"
4,Good for people with coccyx pain,"Most four or five star reviews seem to be from larger people. I am only 5'4"" and 120 lb, but I had coccyx injury and find that this is the only seat that supports my seat bones completely so that the pressure on the coccyx is minimised. The only complain I have is that the horn is too wide. The manufacturer should note that just because people need a larger seat doesn't mean the horn size needs to be proportionally increased. As a result, riding on it chaffs my inner thighs a bit. However, given the choice of excruciating coccyx pain or a bit of chaffing, I choose the latter, now improved by riding with knees a little more apart.Also, the seat came much larger than I expected from the product photo. I think this is because of the horn size being so wide that one thinks it's a smaller seat by assuming the horn size to be of ""normal"" size, hence the distorted proportional size of the seat.All said, there is no coccyx pain at all!"
3,tried hard to make it work,"I was really hoping this would work but alas...1. it came without the seat clamp so much time was spent finding the right size clamp.2. finally found a clamp and put it on the bike but the way it is shaped (mounded up) kept pushing me off towards the front, even after adjusting the level, so my whole bike ride was spent pushing myself back up unto the seat but never could get situated in the middle...the material was also slippery.3. on a plus side, when I called the company that sold it, they were very helpful.4. I can send it back but it will cost money plus it must go back in the same box, with all the stuff that was sent with it, but it arrived in a broken box with nothing in it except the seat."
3,Where did it go?,"I had to come into the 21st century and use a backup better than the old 1.44 floppy drive. I bought the Iomega 100 mb zip and it is an improvement, however I am always having to reinstall it because it seems to disappear. It is always wanting me to install a storage device driver everytime I boot. There has to be a better backup drive out there. I thought Iomega was the leader in the field, but I guess they are like HP and put out junk too."
5,Iomega 100MB zip drive.,I'm very happy with the ability to trasport large amounts of data back and forth on a rewritable disk. This is especially helpfull since my school has zip drives on all thier computers so all I need is one disk to take every thing to and from the computer lab.
3,Variable Niven,"Larry Niven is a good and well-known science fiction writer, so I guess I expected all the stories in this collection, ""Convergent Series"", to be good. Some were, some less so. Niven is pretty pessimistic in his science-fictional accounts. Really, he remains pretty close to reality, just setting his commentaries on war, society, and treatment of the environment in his outlandish settings. If you strip away the science part of science fiction, only a few of Niven's stories here really stand up to competition from horror writers like Poe or mystery writers like Agatha Christie. As for the science fiction part, I guess it's a matter of taste, but I'd go for Ray Bradbury before more Niven. Try the first story in the collection, though -- it'll make a vegetarian out of you."
2,"Nice rifle, okay boots, rest a loss","I agree with all the bad reviews. Oversized head, expression like a butch on a bad day, minimal articulation, padded outfit than you can't take off without damaging, really dumb bulky helmet. IMPOSSIBLE to believe this represents a fast, lithe killer rather than a stiff zombie guard.However, the sniper rifle (Lucas' usual sf version of generic WWII look) is high quality, and the boots are not bad for female action figures a little larger than Barbie. All depends on what you want her for.--(...)"
2,Very small Books,"I was expecting better quality of the books I was purchasing. I disappointed because one of the books was damaged. I also thought the and the siddurs would be bigger, especially the hardback book. I do not think I will purchase these items again from this company."
1,ZERO STARS NOT AVAILABLE,"I'm looking for a quality Siddur, preferrably in common Ivrit with an Aramaic milon, but Sphardi is acceptable. This is obviously Ashkenazi, the most ludicrous form of Hebrew EVER!!! Just as ""a rose by any other name is a rose,"" a ""T"" is a ""T"" is a ""T,"" dagesh or not! There is zero logic in pronouncing Tav as Samekh! ""TH"" for Sphardi tav w/o dagesh, I can deal with that. I wouldn't take this or anything in ashkenazi for FREE!END OF REVIEW!"
2,see an optomotrist before you buy,the print is quite small. make sure you've got good eyes or a good pair of glasses if you buy this item
2,"Firewire works, USB does not!","Neither USB adapter has ever worked on this unit. My firewire adapter has worked fine, but unfortunately most of the connections I need the card for are USB. I would recommend going with a more reliable brand. Hope this helps!"
5,Large Letter Keyboard,The keyboard arrived promptly and has been a great gelp for my failing vision.Couldn't ask for more.
3,"Not great, good, but not great","I'm going to have to agree with the review T-Mac wrote about this album. It has some good tracks, which are rather catchy, but I can't see calling this the album of our time or anything. I listen to this album a few times a week, but it's not something that I'd be running down the streets proclaiming love for. Mostly upbeat and happy, this is a good emo album. Not to the level of Postal Service, by any means, but still a good album."
2,The worst music in recent memory !,"For the past few years I have had the feeling rock music is going downhill, never did I have that thought more then the day my ears met this album. I think people like this kind of music because it is in no way challenging to the mind. Please do not buy this album, there are so many things you can better do with your time and money, I suggest getting yourself a Ray Charles CD, or the cast album or Les Miserables, or Hendrix, so you can know the sound of good music and cling to that in today's mindless listening culture."
2,When did Aaron Carter start using distorted guitars?,"I only gave this album 2 stars because the music itself is so good. It's a great album ruined by what sounds like a 14 year whining about how he couldn't get a date for the prom. I do realize this guy is 22, which is what bothers me so much. I thought this album would be a bit more mature than ""calendar days"", but that is not the case. I would recommend this to young teenagers due to its positive message, but I think it's a bit too cheesy for people Bryce Avary's age. I want to like it so bad, but the lyrics are really hard not to laugh at. But props to Bryce for at least being positive. I'm sure he's a nice guy, but I had to be honest."
4,Not what I had expected,"I got the game simply because it came with my Gameboy Advance. I'm 18 years old, so it seems like this game would not appeal to me. However, I was instantly addicted. It is a pretty fun puzzle game, but I don't think it really fits for the target audience. I know my GA was previously owned by a smaller child, about 5 years old, and she couldn't really get past the first zone. If your looking for a brainteaser that will challenge you and keep you hooked, or just something to occupy your time in the bathroom, this is an OK cartridge to keep around."
1,Missing several tracks from the movie,I'm giving this one star because I did not find in any track of this CD the songs I wanted from the movie. My mistake for buying it without listen a sampler. The songs I wanted were the one from the scene when Han and Sean enter a party and the one when black Sean buddy's green Touran appears from the elevator in the parking lot.
2,viewer beware,"The beginning of the film states that it is ""inspired by"" true events, etc. The film makers sure have a loose interpretation of ""inspired by."" the main character, Dr. Garrigan, Amin's physician, is nearly completely fictional. At the end of the movie, there are statements on screen stating what happens to Amin, but there was nothing about Dr. Garrigan. My husband and I were curious, so we googled. He's a fictious character! Loosely based on an British advisor Amin had, who served 5 years imprisonment for his part in Amin's regime. We felt dooped! It is one thing to watch a movie knowing it is fictionalized, it is another to be made to believe what you are watching are real events.True, the movie is well acted. And the atrocities Amin commited were a background to the main story, but anything that tells the ""inside story"" is called into question in my mind because it all revolves around this fictional character...that you are lead to believe is true."
4,Farting in Uganda.,"I didnt want to watch this film because I feared having to see masses of visual atrocities like in Ruanda but there were just two and like any good horror film, they were the price of having sex. There were a lot of shootings though adding an American touch. I thought Whittiker looked rather Amrican and the many semi-nude dancers did too. Here the Brits were the bad guys similar to the Belgians in Hotel Ruwanda. Idi killed 300,000 of his countrymen in 1971 while 600,000 were slain in Ruwanda in 1994. Whittikers performance was marvelous, slipping as he did from jocularity to brutality in a flash. His appearance was perfect as well being a huge lumpy man. The doctor fellow was girlish and too incredibly stupid to be believed. He didnt deserve to be rescued and its impossible to believe he was ignorant of Idi's atrocities. He was Idi's Eva Braun so of course in order to move the story along, he had to have sex with one of Idi's wives just to prove he was not a homosexual."
1,Poor Character Development,"Forrest does a good job but that is about it.I did not have any emotional attachment to any of the characters and thus did not have any connection.If you watch the ""special features"" you will learn that this movie is FICTION. There was no Doctor. If there were, he would have been killed in the first meeting. (Who grabs a gun in the front any president and not shot to death?)I was expecting this movie to be factual and not fiction.The director should go back to making documentaries- this is one of the worse movies I have ever seen."
3,better than the book,"Orson Welles had a theory that bad books make good movies, and The Last King of Scotland proves his point: from a clunky and ham-fisted novel comes a quite dazzling film, mostly notable for its great acting. It may not be a genre-defining masterpiece, but it's engaging and often beautiful. Even the soundtrack (which is mostly Nigerian, but that's besides the point) is exciting. Definitely a case when it is better to have seen the movie than read the book!"
3,A Sometimes Boring Film With a Great Performance,"This is one of the few times I actually dozed off to sleep from time to time while watching a movie. Forest Whitaker is the real deal here and deserves his praise, but I still can't believe Leonardo DiCaprio didn't get a nomination for The Departed. That was the performance of the year for me. The movie was pretty good at times, but it just didn't have enough substance to interest me for the entire length. It was good to see Agent Scully again (aka Gillian Anderson), but she was barely in the film. I would wait to catch this one on DVD, if only to see Forest Whitaker in his most powerful role."
3,"Forest Whitaker was great,but the film was so-so","i saw this Movie last night and thought that Forest Whittaker did a great Job as Ugandan Leader Idi Amin. Whitaker captures the Rawness and the Charisma that was Amin. the film during the last forty minutes brings all the rawness and coldness. the Maddness and and varous other things are all here. I thought that Dr.Garrigan was interesting,but while the Movie had strong points, i just felt that Forest Whitaker was the main reason why this film worked because alot of the film was kinda there.if this film had have matched Whitaker's Intensity then this film would have swept at the Oscars in a Breeze."
3,Should Have Been A Great Film,"Forrest Whitaker's mesmerizingly powerful performance as one of the last century's more brutal tyrants was this movie's sole saving grace. Even the presence of James McAvoy, one of my favorite young actors, didn't do much toward salvaging what this motion picture, by its closing act, had become. The Last King of Scotland had a lot of talent behind it and the first half showed that, but the promise of its beginnings was simply annihilated in its muddled second half, which was little less than a cinematic disaster. I can't recall the last time I saw a plot go to pieces quite as badly as was the case here. A very real shame, too! Yes, Whitaker was brilliant, the scenery was impressive, the story of Idi Amin was ripe for telling, but this almost totally fictionalized would-be bio-pic was a letdown of major proportions."
2,Pointless and exploitative,"Does anybody else find Forest Whitaker irritating? It's probably sacrilege to say it, but I've always found him over-earnest, even in junk like ""Species"". Anyone who caught him recently in ""ER"" vicing someone's hand were subjected to the full range of tics, eyeball bulging, sweating and imposing theatrics he could muster until total thespian meltdown was achieved.This film didn't appear to have any purpose other than to distress the viewer as much as possible. The Man Called Horse scene right next to an international incident was silly and if Amin didn't sow his wife's body parts up in funny ways as most commentators have suggested, why pander to possibly racist myths? Most puzzling.I did however like the Scottish guys performance and the direction was reasonable. Amin was miscast but that is where we came in."
1,Garbage,"Movies like this make me want to never watch movies again. A disgusting look inside the worst of people. The director speaks to base, gruesome sensibilities. He must think his viewers are stupid."
5,The Last King of Scotland,"I enjoyed watching this dvd and felt the persona of Idi Amin was well portrayed. Having lived in Uganda prior to and during his ""reign"" I can say it is a true to life portrayal of the man!"
4,Fine return of a good talent,"Campbell's 2 albums that he recorded for Columbia in 1992 and 1995 have sadly gone out-of-print. So, look for them at used stores. This release finds Campbell toning down on the Rockabilly mannerisms that marked his previous stuff. He's also dumped the canned 90's Nashville sound that has marred so many of today's Country releases. Here, he's returned as a country/folk/Americana singer-songwriter. And the results are excellent. Covering 2 fine Jamie O'Hara songs and getting help from Chris Knight, Kevin Welch and Dean Miller on others, Campbell has crafted an almost perfect blend of country songs with folk tinges. ""Makin' Good Time"" is one of the year's best Country songs."
1,disapointed,sorry. it has not done anything but drop the few leaves and die.. i'm extremely disappointed. maybe this is just not the right area for it. zone 9. i was told by a nursery here that it was a beautiful honeysuckle and that i would be lucky to find it... i sure tried. that's the way it goes...
2,NOT REALLY TOO FUNNY OR ENJOYABLE,"THIS TIME AROUND, SANTA CLAUS RETIRES AND IT'S UP TO ERNEST TO GET HIM BACK BEFORE CHRISTMAS COMES. NOT REALLY FUNNY AND IT'S JUST NOT THAT ENJOYABLE. THIS WAS THE SECOND MOVIE IN THE ERNEST SERIES. KIDS WILL PROBABLY LIKE THIS ONE, BUT OLDER TEENS [LIKE MYSELF] OR ADULTS WON'T REALLY FIND TOO MUCH OF ANYTHING TO ENJOY IN THIS MOVIE. SKIP THIS ONE. FOLLOWED BY ERNEST GOES TO JAIL."
5,An underrated Christmas gem,"Goofy redneck Ernest P. Worell (Jim Varney) is a taxi driver in Orlando as he meets Santa Claus (Douglas Seale) who just arrived at the airport and must find one person who is worthy as his successor as he is on the verge of retiring as he must pass his magic onto a new Santa as Ernest with a cute teenage girl named Harmony (Noelle Parker) as his helpers.Exciting and delightful Christmas themed comedy and one of the better entries of the Ernest film saga, i remembered seeing this movie when i was a kid when it first came out 3 times and became one of my holiday faves. Sure it borrows a bit from ""Miracle on 34th Street"" with a few holiday classics but who the hell cares? it's still a funny and sweet tale about passing the torch that i recommend.The DVD has OK picture despite some grain and there's zero extras"
5,One of my favorites!,"This is one of my three favorite Christmas movies of all time along with ""Christmas Vacation"" and ""it's a wonderful life."" I would say it needs to go on everyone's must see Christmas movie viewing list."
5,C'MON VERN!!!!!!!,"Jim Varney, AKA Ernest P Whirrel (god bless) Of course you should own just about all of the Ernest movies because they are all HILLARIOUS! I saw this one in the movies when I was about five years old. Its a little bit corny, due to the fact that the guy who plays Santa Claus is a complete tool, but Ernest as always saves this movie and makes it cool. Plot: In order to find a troubled teen girl realize that there really is a Santa Claus, Ernest tries to locate the real St. Nick. Or something like that... any way, if you are looking for a funny family Christmas movie, this one is funny, yet mild enough for kids young and old."
4,If you love Ernest!,"In my opinion the best Ernest movie. Surprisingly good acting for a comedy. DVD production is fine.PROSfunny, solid DVD productionCONSnone"
5,movie,"thank for the quick responce . enjoyed the movie . funny , would recamend for whole family very funny ."
3,"Help Save ""Ernest Saves Christmas""","What a shame this is unavailable...our tape is so worn out and almost unwatchable. Okay...it's corny and silly and, hey, it's Ernest! More important, it's clean...even Grandma can watch! ""Ernest Saves Christmas"" really does have a good message/moral... This is one of the few movies my three teenagers, my husband and I will sit down and watch together and everyone enjoys during the holiday season. Please make this one available again! I know this would have been a hit on Christmas morning...oh well. Maybe next year."
4,Great Slapstick,Man I remember when this movie first came out and I laughed so hard watching this film. I recently just bought this movie and watched it again and it is still funny. The film is a classic comdey movie in which a person can relate to with the child inside them and at the same time laugh at the slapstick of the film that it seems too silly at times.
5,Ernest Saves Christmas,"My grandson and I watch Ernest Saves Christmas every year while we decorate our tree. We had it on a VHS that I taped from the TV so we had to go through all the comericals. This year it was great, we just popped in the DVD and enjoyed watching it uninteruped. I appreciated that it arrived in a timely manner so our tradition could live on."
5,Great movie!,"This is a great movie. We had a copy on VHS but our VCR player finally died. Can't wait to watch it next Christmas, if I can wait that long."
4,Bring back the memories,For those of us raised up at camp. Looking forward each summer to reunite with our friends and familiar surroundings. The feeling of camp is special and the bonds formed are forever. As with this film it brings it all back the feelings the sites the sounds and emotions. Though the script is good and story is familiar we can all relate. Expect to laugh and to have a few tears not only for the characters but also for your own lost youth and how life has turned out. Enjoy and allow yourself a chance to escape back to a time of innocents.
3,Before you Buy Even Flo Please Read,Please read before you buy a travel system. I have many Even Flo products and have actually been a fan. Until I bought the Embrace 5 Travel System (similar to the Aura). First of all the infant carrier started to show white stress marks in the gray handle before my son reached 15 lbs. It also tends to sit a bit upright in the car. Secondly the Stroller! If you have more than 9 lbs in it the wheels get stuck due to poor design. When I called the company to ask what to do. They said it wasn't a safety issue. I nearly knocked over the stroller several times while trying to walk on a sidewalk. The wheels get stuck and comes to a complete stop or goes to the side. I am very disappointed in Even Flo. BEWARE BEFORE YOU EVEN FLO INFANT CARRIES OR TRAVEL SYSTEMS. Please make sure you put at least 20 lbs of weight in a stroller and push it around before you buy. I wouldn't give mine away its going in the trash.
3,Can't help but feel a bit cheated,"As for the material itself, it ranks with Bukowski's best. It demonstrates his wit and charisma easilly. The poems themselves are fantastic. However, this release is simply an edited version of the out of print ""Poems and Insults"" reading. The legendary performance was released a few years earlier complete and uncut. The producers of this CD obviously had the rights to that performance. This makes me wonder why they cut out several of the poems? Judging how the original performance isn't too hard to find, one can't help but feel a bit cheated when a company sells this album. The poems themselves are fantastic, but why did Takoma Records opt to not include several others. Judging how its hard to find a used copy of the ""Poems and Insults"" album from a few years ago, customers will have to buy this one for the time being."
2,"Offers some quick tips, but they are too vague","I thought the best idea brought forth was Rabin's definition of flirting. It is as follows: ""Flirting is the art of interacting with others withouth serious intent."" This does not mean you you play mind games, it simply means that while flirting you get to know people and find out whether you want them as a business contact, or a serious relationship. Overall the book offers a few imaginative ideas, but it really is too vague. If you follow some of the suggestions you will only get so far before you may have to ask yourself how you make the transition from just flirting to building a closer tie with that person you may have bumped into at the store. All in all it really falls short in delivering really useful ideas."
1,Humiliated Myself,"This book caused me to be laughed at, have a drink thrown in my face, and laughed at some more. And I ain't even that ugly!"
2,Disappointing - falls apart to easily,"I bought this based on a great review in the Oppenheimer Toy book I bought. I am very disappointed! My daughter is 11 months old and with just a bit of a nudge, she's able to knock it over and it comes apart and she loses interest. She's not even interested in playing with the balls that came with it - not to mention there's nowhere to store the balls so they just end up at the bottom of our toybox anyway. Wouldn't recommend..."
2,Overpriced. For the price consumers should buy a Boxer Precision Screwdriver set,Amazon sales this for around $13. At my local homedepot it's around $5 to $6 plus tax. At that rate it's still expensive from my point of view because for $11. I can buy myself aBoxer 30 Pcs 4mm Precision Screwdriver Set. It's only a small difference in price tag but the Boxer screwdriver has 30 pieces. Although you may not need all the pieces at once but one day it might come to surprise you.
5,Tech Mix 5 Thumbs Up!,"Micro knows best. A perfect blend of house, techno and trance that just keeps you asking for more...I have most of Micro's CD Mixes and though i already have a fav: OUT THROUGH THE INPUT, Tech Mix 5 is a must have! Definitely a chill out kinda mix...Starting out deep with ""Flash"", uplifting the mood with ""the spell"" (hot track!) and on and on...JUST GET IT!"
4,UND Bean Bag,"When I ordered this item, I wasnt sure how the quality would be. I had to have it shipped from the states to where I am now ...overseas. I got it and when it was given to the person that it was intended for ...the look on their face said it all...Definitely a worth while purchase. Despite the fact that I am not a UND fan!!!!"
2,Extensive Grammar book,"A good book for Grammar students at class with a teacherinstruction and a good group of students. Many excercises have to be done with classmates But my idea when I bought it was to study it by myself, I expected it a little different."
2,Too sensitive,"After using the strips a few times, and pumping and dumping during those sessions after drinking 1-2 drinks, I decided to try it to see if it would detect any alcohol the following morning (10 hours after my second glass of white wine the preceding evening). It turned dark green-blue, indicating that I had a significant amount of alcohol in my milk. No way. The instructions do admit the test is ultrasensitive, sometimes being affected even by vapors in the air...but even in the absence of cleaning products or other sources of alcohol in the area, it still is way too sensitive in my opinion. I agree with a previous reviewer...use common sense, and wait the 3 hours for each drink consumed. This test is too expensive and too sensitive to be useful in my opinion."
2,Spooked a 2-year Old,"When this DVD was first watched, the adults in our household thought that these Winnie the Pooh stories did a very good job introducing ghosts to the 23 1/2 month old in the house. However, in recent days we have decided to hide this movie because it has caused the 23 1/2 month old to worry about ghosts now, even though we told her and she agrees with us verbally that ghosts are not real. This little girl is an avid movie watcher and has an amazing concentration level when it comes to watching them. Unfortunately she has internalized this one and now will not go to bed in her room at night alone. And she has never had a problem going to bed before. Parents beware of this DVD, just because it is Pooh does not mean it is totally harmless to impressionable little minds."
3,A reduced size reproduction,"According to the publisher ""This Elibron Classic Replica Edition is an unabridged facsimile of the edition published in 1837 by Charles Tilt, London."" However, where the original is a folio size this reproduction is reduced to an octavio size measuring only 21 x 13.5 x 1.75 centimetres. The text is still very large but the drawings -- reduced to a quarter of the original size -- suffer: the linework is so fine that it disappears in places and most of the dimensions are unreadable. This paperback has glued binding and 104 pages. The original publication was in 3 volumes. This edition seems to be incomplete. It is certainly missing the full page drawings of the metopes that I recall from my university's first edition."
3,Of course I've only read the author's 5-star blurb below...,"...but I like the idea that the novel starts with a ""faint visual"" coming from beyond Uranus (most of the time). May not want to look too closely before getting down to the action of musing over 33 years of backstory..."
5,Neil Diamond at His Best,"All 12 songs on this CD are excellent. Even the best version of ""Shilo"" is on this CD. If you grew up during the 1970's and 1980's and thought that Neil Diamond was the lamest performer on Earth, you need to listen to this CD. In the 1960's, Neil was actually a Cool Rockin' Daddy, singing classics like ""Girl, You'll Be a Woman"", ""You Got To Me"" and ""Cherry, Cherry"". Then he left Bang Records and all the bang went out of his music, except for a few isolated classics like ""Sweet Caroline"" and ""Cracklin' Rosie""."
2,Disappointment,"My disappointment is in the way the songs were recorded-not Neil Diamond.When I first started to play this CD, I thought it was blank. I had to jack up the volume to hear it. The whole CD sounds muted. It's a shame because you really miss the horn section in a lot of the songs. With the technology today, you think they could make these songs sound outstanding.I give the songs 5 stars but the recording 0 stars."
5,Diamond's earliest pop gems,"Before rising to international superstardom as an adult-contemporary vocalist, Diamond started out as a songwriter and recording artist for Bang Records. This collection pulls together 12 of his best compositions from that period, produced by Brill Building stalwarts Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich.Included are well-known masterpieces like ""Kentucky Woman"" ""Cherry Cherry"" and ""Solitary Man."" But perhaps more interesting (and less well anthologized) are cuts lesser known as Neil Diamond compositions like ""The Boat That I Row"" (recorded by Lulu), Red Red Wine (recorded by ska artist Tony Tribe in the 60s and ressurected by UB40 in the 80s), and his own version of ""I'm a Believer,"" which scored a massive hit for the Monkees.Diamond had already mastered his singing style by the time he laid down these earliest sides, and combined with the fresh well of songs he was tapping, the results couldn't be anything less than stellar."
2,Very Disappointing,"John Updike is a great writer - so I have no idea why he wrote this confusing, disjointed, rambling book. I did not enjoy it, and normally would not have finished a book I was getting so little pleasure from, but I believed to the bitter end that Mr. Updike would somehow reward my efforts. Unfortunately, this was just a bad book"
5,"A dithering, ineffectual leader","I cannot be objective about Updike. I consider him a genius and swallow his text whole.But something that is missing from the other reviews is the parallel between the narrator and the primary subject of the book (not President Ford, but the 15th President, James Buchanan). The narrator portrays Buchanan sympathetically, but as an dithering, ineffectual leader. He draws no parallel between Buchanan and Ford (who was unfairly portrayed as a bumbler in his day). Rather, the narrator seems to be confessing his own ineffectuality in forming intimate relationships with his wife, lover and children, and his tendency to dither rather than commit to a monogamous relationship."
4,A Neat Collectable,This is a pretty cool hand-painted collectable to add to my Michael Myers collection. It looks great and is heavy and durable. A must-buy!
1,Don't get burned!,"This device isn't worth the money. It doesn't cook bacon evenly and to get all of the bacon done, you have to cook it till the grease in the bottom is exploding all over your microwave and is ready to ignite. I even covered the bacon with one sheet of paper towel as advised and the mess was incredible. Now instead of a simple cleanup by placing a skillet in the dishwasher, i must still put the ""Makin a Mess"" in the dishwasher , but i must also clean the entire inside of my microvave oven of all this grease! What an incredible mess! You would have to totally wrap this useless device in at least 4 sheets of paper towels to contain the messy, popping grease from coating the inside of your microwave. Even then, i think the mess would be much worse than just sticking a skillet in the dishwasher! This was invented by a kid and you can sure tell it! Don't waste your money!"
3,Therapists,I purchased this book because I am a therapist who works with children and families in crisis. This book has a lot of good stuff in it but buyer beware that a lot of the activities in this book require that you have certain board games etc.
5,Use these techniques today!,This book has so many great activities that can be used with children with minimal preparation. Each activity is clearly explained and easy to understand the purpose for using. I have purchased several books from Liana Lowenstein and use them regularly in my private practice.Turn the Page for Play Therapy ActivitiesJoy
3,"actually it is a pretty bad one, only if you look carefully","did a lot of research and decided to buy this model. noticed one problem: the brightness on the screen is nor even. this is expecially obvious if you open a file which has one-color background. Say, you open your word before typing anything. Also, this becomes very obvious if you click autoadjust button, and the screen becomes blank for a couple of seconds, you will see the brightness/lighting is not evenly distributed. My friend bought the same thing, and he did not even notice. After I told him and we found out both monitor have the same problem. Also checked some older model and noticed the similar problem.So, it seems to us this is a big problem, and possibly some other people who do graphic design, web design. However, some people who do not care about this feature, then this might not be a problem for them."
5,got it for class,"So yes I had to buy this for class. It was cheaper than buying it from school and it arrived on time, so I'm happy."
2,Terrible,"This item is terrible for the bedroom! It lights up the whole bedroom unless you turn the blue background down and then you can't even see the numbers. It is also very difficult to set the alarm, radio station for the alarm, etc. Not user friendly at all! We will be moving it to a bedroom that is not used. Money wasted."
4,Star Swirl,Star Swirl is a white pony with pink hair. Her mark is a circle of little pink stars.Durability is only four stars because the straps on the hat broke on one of my ponies' hats and now the hat falls off all the time.Educational is three stars because she can teach kids to water plants.
5,still snickering.....,Every summer we go from the West Indies where we live to vacation at the family cabin in Minnesota. I try to pick up a book to get me in the mooooood! I picked this up at the hotel in Minneapolis.....what a find. I laughed and laughed. The recipes in the back are pretty darn good too...we tried some of them at the cabin! Good Readin' and Good Eatin'!
1,Engine Swapping for Older Cars,"If you want to engine swap any newer fuel injected cars (like naturally aspirated to turbo, etc.) this book is not for you! This seems to be a history book on the older big block Chrysler engines."
4,Great DVD,"I viewed excerpts from a number of L'Elisir d'Amore DVDs on the Web before placing my order. My first choice wasDonizetti - L'Elisir d'Amore / Eschwe, Netrebko, Villazon, Wiener Staatsoper, because I prefer traditional performances, and because that performance truly sparkles. However, I liked the Alagna, Gheorghiu performance enough that I ordered both DVDs. I'm glad I did."
4,Good as it ever was,"A fine album - the good songs are really good. There are a few that I don't think were worthy, but very good overall."
4,Wonderful Translation...,"but the bonded leather edition of the thinline version is of a ""Oh, come on Crossway!"" type quality. It seems nothing more than an plastic type of rubber. The genuine leather binding is good. And I've recently purchased the large print version. One online Christian book seller states that the ESV large print bible is their most popular bible in sales.Don't miss this translation!"
5,Riders of the Sun,"This collection of stories from Ballard's early years displays him in full command of his considerable literary gifts. Ballard excels in the short form and this book contains some of his very best; most notably, The Drowned Giant and The Garden of Time. His vivid, visual and original imagination are coupled with a jade cool narrative style, resulting in a uniquely strange body of work. Chronopolis and Other Stories contains none of the excesses for which Ballard has been damned and praised, just sixteen fine short stories; two or three of which are among the best you'll ever read."
5,Awesome Card,"First of all, this card is not a lot more than the 59 block one. The average game requires 3 blocks or more. And there are also many modes of gameplay that require WAAAAAY more than 59. For example, the Dynasty Mode in NCAA Football 2003 requires 216 blocks. To create a player of your own and to save it is 53 blocks. Profiles and settings are another 5 blocks. So if you have this, you can comfortably save big files. I saw this a week ago and thought, 5 bucks more for 4x the memory is not a lot. This is a great deal. Buy It!"
5,great way to save,with this memory card you get more than 4 times the space of the original 59 memory card...! With this card you are most certain not to spend anymore cash on memory cards for the cube.
4,phwoar!,if you get stuck on a desert island bring this along great as porn goes but unlike other porn skips through the cheesy plot and keeps you genuinley entertained. a bit dated now but still a good buy
1,Sonic subjectivism and tribal nonsense,"I bought this CD when it first came out in 1992 and loved it, being that I was philosophically bankrupt, depressed and flirting with various fringe elements of society. This music is that of a con artist gleefully biting the hand that feeds him with no concern for truth or integrity. This is not art. On ocassion the music is cool. Not worth it though."
1,"Not very good, a few songs sound like Barry Manilow","I think there are about 5 fans on the planet for this music. Why make a 1980s synth-pop album in the 21st century? It seems Byrne is floundering for an identity here. ""Paint it Black"" is messy, but could work for disco clubs. Everything else is pastiche."
3,Needs more trucks and less silliness,"My 23 month old son loves this video and asks to watch it over and over. He loves wathcing the different trucks work, but loses interest during the scenes where Dave and Becky are talking and arguing. Also, he gets upset about seeing the tow truck back into the car and then drop it and about watching the garbage truck drop the garbage can and then roll away. I'm ordering other truck videos hoping he'll get to see more of the trucks (the part that facinates him) and less of the silly stuff (that upsets him and annoys us)."
1,Not a quality production,"There goes a Truck was a disappointment for my wife and I, as it failed to hold our childs attention. He is completely fascinated by trucks in real life and has a great ability to focus on other videos (Baby's First Impressions series <Excellent!> and Teletubbies), but the production quality of this video was really lacking. It covered many details of the trucks too quickly and had no helpful graphics, i.e. how the drive train worked, etc. The music was like that from bad 70's TV cop shows. The dialog and banter between hosts was silly and many of the action sequences, like mistakenly dropping a car off of the tow truck were really unnecessary humor that our little guy would be better without. We will not plan to get any more of the videos in this series and only hope that another company with integrity will do justice to what is an excellent concept."
1,I agree with Undermars,"After reading the glowing reviews of this record, I immediately went out and bought a copy. I couldn't wait to pop it in and be blown away. Unfortunately, I'd have to say that I agree with Undermars' synopsis. The reviews before his are obviously from friends of the band or maybe even the BANDMEMBERS THEMSELVES. Not to say that it is terrible, but it is terrible. I wouldn't say quit your day jobs but I would say that working part-time probably isn't a bad idea."
2,Possible dangerous product.,"I recently bought this string for my 50LB pistol crossbow. The string is very high quality, a trait the tips do not share. The crossbow tips lasted about 15 shots before both shattered. The fragments propelled by the string were moving very fast. One fragment grazed my cheek, thankfully i was wearing safety glasses. This product has a great string, earning it two stars but the plastic tips are not durable and a injury waiting to happen. Moral of the story, wear glasses when doing anything similar to this.Be safe!"
5,"Great item, problem with packaging.","I love these wood chips for my indoor smoker but when they arrived one of the containers was completely open with the box being filled with wood chips and another one the lid was loose and was some of the chips were out. They should be taped shut or something, the lids are not secure at all. I poured all of the chips back into the one container so it ended up a bit of a mix. I do love my indoor smoker I bought from Amazon recently and these chips work excellent in it. I am making some amazing smoked foods in my house."
2,not chips,"this product is more like sawdust,seller should note product is not made for regular smokers and made for cameron smokers only"
3,Bad Packing,"When we opened the box, all the containers of wood chips had spilled into the box.Salvaged what we could, but disappointed in the packing of this product."
3,A Decent Book,"Hmmm. I mildly enjoyed this book. It is what it is. An easy read crime story. But then I do wonder what the hype is about. The book is clearly writen but with no particular style or grace. It does delve into the same gritty urban territory as The Wire, but with only a fraction of the insight. Much of the writing is unfortunately ridden with mediocre crime novel cliches. And although I enjoyed it, I finished the book with the familiar feeling that I have when puting down 90% of crime fiction- undernourished - somewhat equivilent to having eaten a bag of potato chips.Pelecanos is no Chandler, nor is he Ross Macdonald.So why the hype? Why the desire to make the book more than it is? Perhaps it is to lend more status to the seemingly senseless suffering and hopelessness of many of the lives it depicts? If you are looking for writing that really does accomplish that and covers the same geography, I suggest Lost in the City or All Aunt Hagar's Children by Edward P. Jones."
1,Where's the story?,I love to read and listen to books on CD but I have tried to listen to this a couple of times and I am disgusted. The language and the sexually inferences are so vile and gratuitous that I can't get past the second disc. Very disappointed.
1,WHEN FAST EDDIE SOLD OUT.....,"FASTWAY is nothing more than ex-Motorhead's British axeman Fast Eddie Clarke trying to make huge money. The sound in this CD is horrible, I don't know how people gave it such reviews !!! IT's pure cliched American pop-metal, produced by ""give me a hit single soon"" Eddie Kramer. All the songs are discardables, the vocals are incredible mean, there's no energy at all, ony bubble gam music !!!"
3,Too scattered,"This story was very scattered--too many characters were slowly introduced throughout the movie. I knew they would all intersect, but they took so long to get there!The movie was also very uneven in its attempt to introduce too many plots and subplots. I kept feeling yanked back and forth by thedisjointed way the movie unfolded. Any emotional attachment this viewer might have felt toward a character was diminished by the constant shifting of stories.""Duets"" was about a bunch of pretty sad characters who just couldn't seem to get their lives together for one reason or another. Their stories were presented in a hopeless, maudlin way, and I never really cared about any of them.The acting was so-so but the music was fairly good. I was surprised at how well Paltrow sang and Andre Braugher was terrific - both his acting and his spectacular voice. Or was it his voice? Hard to tell.This is one movie I could have missed."
5,Duets,"I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR THIS MOVIE FOR MONTHS. IT IS MY PERSONAL ""favorite feel good movie"". I received it in 2days! Thanks for great 5star service!"
4,"Dumb plot, but good singing.","The plot of ""Duets"" is boring in most places [especially the ex - con, and the dude with like, 80,000 frequant flyer miles] but is great in others [any scene with gwyneth]. Also, the soundtrack rocks. I heard the song ""Cruisin'"" by Gwynnie, and I was blown away that she had a good singing voice, so I bought the soundtrack, liked tracks 2,3,4,7, and 8, and went and rented the video. If you fast forward through the dull parts [as I said before, any scenes with the ex - con and the dork with 80,000 frequant flyer miles, than it is an o k movie. All in all, I would say rent the movie, and buy the soundtrack."
4,Just a fun movie,I can't believe this got so many bad reviews. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The singing wasn't that bad and the acting was good too. I bought the DVD. I think people are missing the point. Don't be so serious.
1,Possibly the worst film since Ishtar,"This movie is a painful waste of good talent. I was drawn to this film by the headline stars like Gwenneth Paltrow and Andre Braugher. Big mistake. The acting is sophmoric - I've seen high school plays that were executed better than this movie. The fault lies squarely in the lap of director Bruce Paltrow and the sorry script. The only professional performance in the movie is Paul Giamatti as a traveling salesman fed up with the rat race of being on the road, only to come home to a wife more interested in chatting on AOL than having a real conversation. I tried to like this film because I love Gwenneth Paltrow, but not even she could save this from being movie-making at its very worst. Even the songs in the movie version don't sound like what was played on the radio - different mixes. Should have never been released."
1,Huh?????,Whoever decided to market this movie using basically only the one scene between Huey Lewis and Gwenyth Paltrow was a GENIUS. If I had know anything accurate about his movie I would never have wasted my time. They should have made it look more like the traffic accident that it was. Tip to Gwenyth: don't make any more movies for daddy.
1,"""Eeeesch"" is right!","Everyone in it is embarrassing to watch (except for a standout performance by Andre Braugher) as even the most talented actors can't make the ridiculous dialogue or implausible situations sing.The one star is for some really good musical numbers. Hey, Huey Lewis, c'mon!"
4,An Unusual Body of Work,"Who exactly is Charlie Daniels? That's a question that can reasonable by posed whn you listen to his greatest hits package. Is he the ""long-haired, hippie-type pinko..."" of the hilariously funny story song ""Uneasy Rider""? Or is he the conformist jingoist of ""South's Gonna Do It Again"" and ""In America""? I suspect the truth lies somehere in the middle.In his prime, Daniels was a decent talent capable of occasional greatness, as he shows on ""Rider"" and his biggest hit, ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia."" Also, his far more empathetic ""Still in Saigon,"" puts Billy Joel's overblown ""Goodnight Saigon"" of the same early 80s time period to shame.Overall, an up-and-down collection with some soaring highlights."
2,Mic function,Mic sound quality okay. On/Off switch on one mic dies not work properly. You must switch it up and down several times to work. Disappointed.
3,as good as you'd expect,"for the price, a very good buy. It's not a professional quality product but for kids and fun, it works fine. A little hum if used in high electrical noise environment, but not around the house."
1,CRAP!!!,"I have a Shure Microphone and there is no comparison in quality!!!! Im a professional singer and know the difference in sound quality with this piece of CRAP compared to my Shure. This makes the voice sound awful!!!! It eats 9Volt batteries too, I can't believe they are selling this ""Throw In"" microphone for for $50 bucks, I had this thrown in with a package deal when I ordered my equipment (speakers, CD player etc...) Im glad I didn't pay $50 dollars or I would have sent it back for my money back!!! Just a molded piece of empty plastic with no substance what so ever. Hold a Sure microphone and hold this-NO COMPARISON WITH SUBSTANCE!!!"
2,Not very good sound.,"I purchased this item in Dec but only recently opened the package and tried it out. It is not great, if it hadn't been so long since my purchase I would send it back. you have to almost have the mic in your mouth for it to pick up your voice. I wasted my money."
5,Great set of mics,"These mics worked great. I purchased them for a poetry reading event, and they performed without any problem whatsoever. The venue was a pretty substantial size aswell, and the mics had no problem. I had zero drops and no humming. i even dropped them while i was setting up and left a big dent on it, but it still performed like nothing was wrong. I'm very glad i took a chance on these mics, and i would definately recommend them."
5,Great resource!,"This book was just the best resource that I could have found for prayers of intercession. It was like a gift from God for me, as it was recommended by our Chaplain, and I found it a valuable source of beautiful prayers that I could parse out to read to the congregation. I highly recommend it to anyone who has the honor of writing prayers of intercession. It blessed me, thoroughly!"
5,Great Service from HassleFreeCell,"I purchased two phones from HassleFreeCell their service was outstanding, I recieved both the phones in a timely manner and the products were in great condition. I'll be sure to return and highly recomend their store."
4,Motorola RAZR V3,"I like this phone. Very easy to use - great sound quality - recieves the best signal strength of any phone I've owned - worked great as I traveled internationally. Also, it is linking to my bluetooth devices very easily. I would definitely recomend this phone to others."
5,Unforgettable Classic Blues,"I had the pleasure of seeing Magic Sam and his band during the American Folk Blues Tour shortly before his death. He was a wonderful performer and this album captures many of the special qualities that make Magic Sam's music so memorable after all these years. I am a longtime Blues fan and this has been one of my ""most played"" albums. Sensitively recorded by Delmark, Sam's vocals are beautiful and soulful and always seem to hit me just right. Sit back and enjoy...if you can stay seated, that is!"
4,Good product overall,I would suggest to add sand to the bucket if you live in a windy place because they are plastic and lightweight. Also you should use these with caution. I noticed that my receptacle was smoking one day and when I opened it up I had a little fire going. I am still pleased with them though. Its better than ashtrays because the wind always blew cigarette butts all over my yard before I purchased these.
3,Good smoking disposal option,"We use this every day and it functions as it should. It is difficult to put the pieces together (tight fit), so it's a pain in the rump to clean. The little tin can they furnish is too small for the unit. Cigarettes fall outside of it and melt the plastic. I wouldn't buy this again."
1,"Really, Just Poorly Written","I'm really into stories of people's supernatural experiences. They give us an insight into the human mind and our hopes and dreams, and yes, maybe even into the afterlife. Sadly, though, this book seemed like it was merely mining a sensationalist bent, and didn't not come across as an honest telling of someone's experiences. The book was not very well written, and seems to read like an cartoonish retelling of something that amy have been on a daytime television show, although I'm not sure if that is the editor's fault or the author's.In all, I would advise that you money is best spent elsewhere, as, in all honesty, I felt that this author may simply be trying to cash in on people's willingness to trust someone with a story to tell about heaven. Sad, really."
4,nice hat,I really like this hat. The embroidery is very nice. I think I would do without the zippered pocket on it to make a five star rating.
1,Loved it until...............,"I adored this tree and used it during Christmas in our game room with ornaments representing our beloved university. It looked so cool that we decided to keep it up year round, It was taking up no room and looked like a cool corner decoration that happened to be coming from the ceiling. Six weeks later the top lights stopped working on (or bottom section depending on how you look at it). A week after that the entirety of the lights quit on us. Since it was more than 30 days after purchase, Amazon said that we needed to contact the manufacturer. Barcana told us ""too bad"", that was it, so sorry, no warranty. I've never purchased anything from anyone that would think that it was okay for their product to last for less than 60 days. I called Amazon back and after some polite yet firm stubbornness, I will ship it back to Amazon and get a full refund. Thank you Amazon. BARCANA is bad news!!!!!"
2,Not for anyone but REAL beginner,"All of the topics could be easily found by a google search in much more details. The only good point after reading this book : a beginner knows how to pick from the smorgasbord of the Net.Pretty useless for Engineers, even beginner Engineers already in the trade. And the book is not cheap !"
1,Barely Funny.,"This is Sandler's only bad movie, as far as I'm concerned with the possible exception of Going Overboard (early unknown film). Number one the teaming of Wayans and Sandler did not work at all. You can also tell that Sandler's sense of humor did not have a lot of control in this. Sandler fans like myself will try anything once and this one was definitely a one timer. A tip for the SANDLER COLLECTION (3pack DVD including Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Bulletproof), dont get it, Bulletproof shouldnt be in the collection and was probably only put there to make it seem essential. Buy Happy and Billy, then buy Waterboy instead!"
5,Jander122,i loved it. Adam Sandler is one of the world's greatest actors of all time. You should watch this movie.
4,A thoughtful account of Willi Unsoeld's life and actions,"As one of Willi Unsoeld's former students at Evergreen, and a friend of Devi's, I appreciated Robert Roper's thoughtful attempt to explain the philosophical roots of Willi's life and actions, and the circumstances surrounding Devi's death. Some of the details are off, such as a few ridiculously inaccurate claims on pages 170-75 concerning my fellow student Keith Hillsbury, but in the end Roper has succeeded much better at evoking Willi's complex, larger-than-life personality than Lawrence Leamer did in his earlier biography, Ascent, which I found frustratingly one dimensional. This is the best account I've seen of a man who not only was one of the great mountaineers of our time, but also a charismatic teacher and important pioneer of outdoor education."
5,no sophmore slump here,"The Matches are back. They still have the catchy melodies and lyrics that will be stuck in your head for days, but with this album they have matured and increased their musical prowes. With many different producers working with the band, the cd offers a wide range of sounds within itself. With Shawn Harris's unique vocals backed by bouncy, catchy guitar and bass this album can appeal to several genres. Punk, pop-punk, alternative, experimental, and so on. The Matches have not only over come the sophmore album slump, they've done so with a more unique and progressive sound. I personally cannot wait to see what this band has in store for the future. No matter what I see it being amazing."
5,CD Review,I thought the CD was real quality. It was original. The rhythm and background was excellent. Miss Havisham stood out. This CD has been well done.
2,HUGE Disappointment!,"I can't believe I am about to write a bad review about a Bone CD, BUT... I was really anticipating the release of this album, and paid $18 to get it the day it came out, only to be incredibly disappointed. I really have to wonder if Layzie and Bizzy even know that they released a new Bone Brothers CD? The entire disc is composed of recycled lyrics from Midwest Cowboy and Thug Brothers... I don't think there are any new verses at all. I will say I liked most of the beats though, but that's about it. Normally I can put in a Bone CD and just let it play through, I tried to listen to this disc twice and gave up... The first Bone Brothers album was WAY better. I can't believe they let this crap get released..... this is going to be added to my CD rack just to help complete my collection but will otherwise just be collecting dust."
5,Did not play all the instruments himself,"I would like to take this opportuity to set the record straight concerning this particular album. Although a wonderfully gifted musician and songwriter, Aldo did not play all the instruments on this album. These songs were performed by members of his touring band along with studio musicians from the new york area.To find out who played what on what song refer to the liner notes on the inside of the album.Those of us who performed on this album are very appreciative of the great reviews this record has received.Thankyou very much."
3,Good Rice But Packages Torn,My wife and I love this rice and our local grocery store stopped carrying them so we bought this bulk order on Amazon. But on all of them the rice packets seemed to be slit open even though the boxes were sealed. It still tasted good enough but it was disconcerting the packets were not fully sealed
3,Flavored Coffee,Disappointed. Not so great taste. Won't buy anymore butter pecan ground coffee. I'll have to try another flavor. Very popular flavor is Hazelnut.
4,Vietnam,"This is a well-written book. The author has pretty much sanitized it of all emotion except that of frustration, which makes it a good historical work. I recommend this over Tour of Duty."
3,Fancy Lad turns out to be a good Cabin Boy,"This movie is funny, although at times to strange for me. I was intrigued to see it because someone I know encouraged me to. I thought it was pretty funny, for example a part where I laughed might have been seeing the little ""fish stick kitties"". Charki (or Sharky, whatever they call him) was pretty comical too, although he didnt even talk, just the appearance of him himself was pretty funny. I do admit I laughed. Yet it was mostly a very weird ( or you could say silly) storyline, which leads my score down a bit for the movie from the top rank 5 stars to 3. I guess that it is just a movie that you kinda' like, like, or don't like at all. I will just put it that way."
1,snoozefest!!,"its strange with all these 5 star reviews theres 70 used to be sold for starting a 1.25. i dont get what anyone sees in Chris Elliot but he is one of the most unfunny guys i have ever seen. just watched him on letterman and again, so unfunny just like this movie! couldnt make it till the end! rather watch paint dry!"
3,One of the all-time great guilty pleasures,"No, it's not Citizen Kane,but for inspired lunacy it's hard to beat. The plot,suffice to say, hardly matters(a twisted take on Captains Courageous)but Chris Elliot and a cast of familiar character actors hit just the right note. With some ultra low-budget SFX thrown in it's easily the most underrated comedy of the last few years. No, it's not one of those 'so bad it's good' flicks, it really is 'good'.So sue me."
1,Has Trouble Staying Afloat,Very bad attemtpt here Chris Elliot's First Major Role is a realdissapoment and just plain stupid. There were some cute jokes here and there but the film fizzeles out quikley with a first time director at the helm with no depth or talent.
3,great when your a kid,this movie is the type of movie you love when your in middle school but when you get older you wonder what was your problem when you where a kid this movie is still ok and it is good to watch with a bunch of people just don't expect a world class movie here
1,This movie stinks!!!,"Whenever I'm asked what is the worst movie I have ever seen, I quickly respond, ""Cabin Boy."" It is like a long, meandering, and entirely pointless joke one might hear from an obnoxious coworker. I would describe the plot, but there is none. I watched the entire movie waiting for the punchline, but it never came. It was written by a former staff writer for David Letterman, which is the only conceivable reason that Letterman would agree to appear in such a monstrosity. Even he later joked about how awful the movie was. Chris Elliott plays the only character he has ever played--the annoyimg dumb guy loser. His limited acting talent, combined with a nonsensical plot, unfunny dialogue, and an absurd tendency to confuse silliness with humor, truly make Cabin Boy a cinematic experience everyone should miss."
5,Lots of good ideas.,"This book has many ideas for useful activities to use with children, as individuals, in small groups or in families. The section with assessment activities was especially good. There is a good reference section at the end of the book."
4,Clouzot brilliance,"Nothing to add about the picture - splendid acting, menacing, claustrophobic atmosphere. Just a word about the disc - visually,about one of the cleanest transfers of a film this old that I've yet seen. Looks like they had a good print to begin with, and didwhat they usually do digitally - the result is pristine. Blacks very black, good contrast. However, they were a little overzealous with the sound, which in its filtered state is unusually tinny and whistly. This detracts somewhat from the overall quality of the presentation, but not too much. The extras are very good and most apropos, as one would expect of Criterion."
5,New Orleans Groove,"I don't know if I went more than a week without listening to this disk for the 6 months I spent in Kenya. I captures my home and my favorite city completely. From blues to R&B to gospel to funk, it's all on this CD. It may be cliche, but this disk is quintessential. I don't know if it's because Cleary doesn't take things for granted (not being a native), or it's a matter of his finding his true home, but whatever it is IT WORKS!"
2,Not what I expected.,"Heard Jon at a Bonnie Raitt concert and thought he was terrific. This CD, however, was nothing like what I heard in concert."
5,A Great Book!,"This book is fantastic! The book is easy to read. The activities are fun and interactive. It is wonderful to have a book that helps you adapt to your child's learning style. There are many helpful resources included. It is a great supplement to what your child is learning in school, as well as a great tool to help him/her improve! I can't wait for the release of Third Grade Success!"
2,not durable at all!,"I bought this for my son when he was 4 years old. I don't think we even had it a year, before the front wheel started wearing down. Now there is actually a big hole in the front wheel (just from a few skids, my son is a pretty cautious driver). I can't wait to replace it with something more durable. This is not at all like the original Big Wheel I had when I was a kid. And this is way over-priced."
1,Big Wheel Bust,"We have had this product for 1 month. It was cumbersome to put together (pieces that do not line up appropriately). It took about 2 hours to set-up. My son loves it, but in 30 days the seat comes off and the screws will not stay tight in the seat. I called the company and they were of NO HELP. They said they will send a hardware package and that is all they can do to help me. I was told initially they could not help me as I did not have the model number from the box or instruction sheet of something I put together 30 days ago! Only after I pressed did they individual even try to figure out which bike I had from a choice of 5. I think there are better products out there for the money."
2,NOT AS ORIGINAL,THIS ITEM IS DEFINATELY NOT AS THE ORIGINAL AND SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO ADVERTISE AS SUCH. IT IS A SMALLER AND A CHEAPLY BUILT RIPOFF OF THE ORIGINAL. IT REQUIRES TOTAL ASSEMBLY WHICH IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE PARTS DON'T FIT AND THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE MINIMAL AT BEST. MY KIDS GREW UP WITH THE ORIGINAL BIG WHEELS IN THE 70'S AND LOVED THEM SO I WAS ANXIOUS TO HAVE MY GRANDDAUGHTER EXPERIENCE THE FUN BUT THIS IS A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT.
3,How to fix pedal problem,"I ended up going to Lowes last night to get parts to fix my son's Big Wheel pedal problem. The parts that came with it were awful and the pedals would not stay on. I ended up getting Hillman 3/8"" Axle/Push Nuts. I had to remove the white plastic cap that it was encased in to fit it in the pedal slots. Also my dad had to grind down the edges to get an exact fit. I know that sounds like a lot of trouble to go through, but it was worth it to have his big wheel in working order."
2,"Ugly, looks like discount special",This set was so ugly that I can't believe Oneida has its name on it. I am returning this immediately. I am completely disappointed. The pattern does not look elegant like in the picture; instead it looks stamped on and consequently very cheap. I've purchased Oneida before and found its flatware beautiful. I don't know what happened here.
4,Nice set! ..........But......,"Hi folks! This set for about $39 was a great deal. It is worth all that and more...but there are a couple of problems with my set. First, there was a fork missing...we only received 11! Second, we did receive 13 knives...one extra...guess someone at the Vietnamese factory had a bad day!....(Did you guys count your pieces?)...Third, upon close examination you can see some imperfections in the workmanship...but nothing that should effect durability. I really appreciate the strength of these pieces...heftier than most Oneida. The forks are longer than most, but I'm not troubled by that. To sum up, I think this is a strong, attractive set for a very good price."
3,"Rags to Riches Story had too little depictions of the ""riches""","I'm nearly 2 hours into the movie before I see/read about any of the ""riches"" in this rags to riches story. 2 minutes later the movie ends. It would been a better (i.e more uplifting) if more was devoted to the ""riches"" portion of the movie; I would've liked to see some examples of how Will Smith's character now being on significantly better financial footing improves his life and the life of his son and the relationship between Smith's character's ex-girlfirend/mother of his son. (And this could've been done while still being true to the real life story the movie was based on.) That said I liked how the son was portrayed as a real kid -- not perfect but not a brat, plus Smith's son's acting ability was better than I expected."
3,"Yes, but....","If you have a student you're trying to inspire to apply him/herself, this is a good inspirational rags-to-riches story showing that you can overcome adversity to beat out people with more advantages.Smith and his real-life son are likeable characters and you'll root for them to succeed.But if you're just looking for an evening's entertainment, the story badly bogs down in the middle. I would've edited it by 15-20 minutes.As another reviewer noted, it was good once, but it is not one that's going on my shelf to be watched again because of that bog-down."
1,Suffer from depression? Don't watch this!!!,"OK I suffer from deppression. I kept watching hoping it would get better and it only got worse. I watch movies for entertainment not to end up at the bottom of the world. I am so surprised there are so many good reviews. The only time it ever got better was thirty seconds before it ended. So if movies tend to have this result...don't watch it. A few of my friends came to me with the same thoughts about it that i had. So don't rent this for a pregnant woman, recently pregnant, or someone with depression."
3,Come on!,"Even though the acting was quite skillful this movie just made me sick. As someone who has experienced real adversity, I found the worship of money and the platitudes in the film completely sickening. What about all the countless people who have had to use shelters and food banks who don't have an opportunity to be an intern for a stock brokerage firm? Are their lives useless? People get comfort from their religion or friends, not from a bunch of yuppies who work in a job that makes money from money. And who gives a (bad word inserted here) if he founded a brokerage firm and made millions selling it? Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"
5,Very nice performances from father and son,"Will and Jaden Smith do a lovely job here, with the former playing against type and the latter making a nice debut in a very natural, unprecocious way. I could have done without some of the more obvious, in-your-face stuff about pursuing happiness and the haves versus have-nots, but these are minor quibbles. You really feel for Chris Gardner as he tries to make enough money to keep his son in day care, feed himself, and still train as an investment intern.Wow...you know you've really hit rock bottom if you and your kid have to sleep on t.p. on the floor of a bathroom in a subway station. So sad. I would have cried too."
3,It could be Me,"It's good. My wife and I spent two evenings watching it. Her main complaint was ""Why don't we get to watch more of the of the good times"" but she cried three times during the movie. My only question was ""How did he keep from smelling bad throughout the film?"" I'm in a little bit of a crisis myself, so I kept thinking ""What will I do if my career fails?"" I hope I don't have to sleep in a cave."
5,Only way to go is Forward,"and this movie proves that no matter what you're circumstances, if you have determination-which Will's character did-you can do what you set your sights on. Young people should have to watch this movie and realize that not everyone gets life handed to them on a silver platter.A movie worth watching again and again. :)Rock on!"
4,Good book - interesting ideas to use at work.,"This is a good book - interesting ideas to use at work for a ""micro-manager"" - it has certainly helped me."
5,A Truly Great Game,"I recomend this game for anyone who likes Mage Knights or will switch from WarHammer to Mage Knights. In this starter you will get a least a few good mages, but it is the perfect item!"
1,DVD Version 3D What Not to Expect..,"I also saw the movie in 3D at the theater in a color version, So thats what I thought I was getting in the DVD version. On the cover of the DVD box, it clearly showed a picture of the glasses on a sticker attached to the box. They were not red and blue but CLEAR. Nowhere on the box does it say that the glasses inside were the red/\blue lenses. Based on the photo I thought they were similar to the theater glasses. When I opened the box, they were the standard Red/\Blue glasses. Needless to say I was disappointed... DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE PICTURED GLASSES ON THE COVER."
5,Is killer,Finally they put this out after how long? About time ... Now all we need is the Percy Jackson release !?
1,No where near the orginal. Get the orginal if you want a story.,"How bad can you get? This was so boring, where is the story line? He looks for his brother, they fall down a hole, sail across a ocean and gush up and are saved. Where are the bad guys? One lame dinosaur? I was very disapointed in this movie, how about some action and they want to make a sequel? Don't waste your money, buy the originalJourney to the Center of the Earthnow that was entertaining. Where's the duck? Anyone who has seen the original knows what I am talking about."
2,Do not buy for the 3D,"I unfortunately did not check the reveiws here before buying this DVD for my neice and nephew. The glasses are horrible, and the kids took them off a few minutes into the movie because they destroyed its watchability. In addition to throwing off all color, they didn't even give the desired 3D effect. Instead you see the same ghosting you would with the glasses off, but with the addition of the color loss. If you're going to buy this movie, throw the glasses away and watch the 2D side."
2,"Alright movie, but no 3D","I bought this movie, as there was nothing said about it not being 3D. They, at Amazon, sent me others to try fixing the problem but there were no 3D versions left. The movie was an average movie but nothing to write home about. The 3D version makes it a far better movie, as I picked it up at Walmart for much less. Amazon has always made the return service very easy which is why I stay with them for most of my online purchases."
3,Kids loved the effects however they are young,"Had a great time watching the movie with my kids, the 3d effects are ok. Nothing special, kids loved them they were grabbing for the things coming out of the TV. Quality could be a lot better."
3,2D good 3D bad,"First off, the disc is one of those two sided kinds and the 3D side which was on top was all scratched because they package the 3D glasses right on top of the disc with no extra paper in between. Secondly, the 3D isn't the polarized style like it was in the movie theater. They re did it to be a magenta and green style instead of the usual blue and red. Ten minutes into the movie I switched it back to the 2D version because while the 3D worked and effects were ok, the glasses seem to knock out all the color making it look almost black and white. Ohh and also the glasses gave me a headache too so it was all around disappointing.Overall the movie is good, fast paced and I enjoyed seeing it again but the 3D needs major improvement. Guess that's why Beowulf wasn't released it as 3d!"
1,The 3D on the DVD is really bad. Pathetic! Incompetent,"I bought the JTTDOTE DVD the day it came out and returned the next day.I only bought it for the novelty of the 3D and was astonished at color shifts during shots, only seldom working 3D and the ugly colors it produces. Truly awful.I saw it in a theater and I think this new 3D is in big trouble if theater owners insist on diming their projectors to save money on bulbs. It was so dark, thanks also to the polaroid sunglasses that must decrease the light by at least two stops (camera reference) I hope Cameron's Avator 3D epic doesn't have this problem.Spy Kids 3D works much better.I can't recommend it. And boy am I disapointed."
5,"Looking for your 1st 3D movie, Look no further...This is the One...","Great movie in all aspects, so far I have seen atleast 10 3D movies and by far this movie ceratinly is entertaining in all aspects; Great 3D, Great Humor, mind you I have a Samsung 3D 55"" LED TV and to this day there is less than 5 movies that get my approval on how 3D was sucessfully used. Definitely recommend, you will not be disappointed!!"
3,Ray's picks.,I didn't realize when I bought the movie that I had seen it before and that it was just ok.
2,ok movie,It was Okay. Over the top for Special Effects. Would have liked more of Jules Verne type of discovery. Actress was very beautiful.
1,3D DVD Version does not work - glasses make you dizzy,DO NOT waste your money on the 3d DVD version. It doesn't work. I want my money back!
4,Journey to the Center of the Earth,You can't lose with this one. Gorgeous 3d. Brendan Fraser. LIttle Josh Hutcherson. This movie looks great on my 3d TV. Lots of action.
2,Money Grubbers,"This is not as good as it was in the Theater. 3D is almost the same as the old ones. Except that there is almost no color. This was put out just for the money. They made you think you would get the same as the theaters, but included the 2D to try and make up for it. Totally disappointed in this. The 2D is the only reason I give this a 2 Star."
2,Problems viiewing on Sony BDP-S300 Player,"I am having problems viewing the BD-DVD on my Sony BDP-S300 player with the latest firmware 4.20 It is stuck in an endless ""loading"" screen. Anyone else having problems viewing this movie with this player? Maybe I have a bad disc?"
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I give it 1 star only because I couldn't rate it 0 stars. The minute I popped it into the DVD player and it started playing, I realized that I had just wasted my money. Only watched 30 minutes and even that was hard to do. Started to give me a headache. Images DO NOT MATCH UP for good 3D. Save your money for something else."
1,DONT BOTHER,"Our family absolutely LOVED! the movie in the theater! The 3d effects used (polarized) totally blew us away, and it was a fun movie because of those wonderful effects! BUT DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH THE DVD, cause the wonderful effects ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE 3d VERSION!!! AND, CONVENIENTLY, THE DVD PACKAGING DOESN'T TELL YOU THIS!!! If you're a fan of the 1950's style red-green type of so-called ""3d"" films..you'll like it. But it's unwatchable - as was the case in the 1950s, so is the case with this dvd - the colors are completely messed up in the ""3d"" version, and the only watchable version is the 2d version...a sad disappointment, considering we were waiting with money in hand for this DVD release. Save yourself the disappointment...put your money elsewhere."
2,Journey to the Center of a Mess,"Director Eric Brevig and star Brendan Fraser make a valiant attempt to update Jules Verne's classic sci-fi adventure novel for about the fifth time. No one no matter what the budget or media (TV, film , made for cable/satellite) seems to be able to improve upon the original film starring James Mason. Bregi and Fraser try hard and there are some marvellous moments in the film, but overall the film falls flat about half way through. Wooden performancesby the cast, a lackluster screenplay that bares almost no resemblance to the original Verne work, and 3D effects that don't really look all that three-dimensional in some parts."
3,Liked it BUT!!,I thought there would be more to this movie..they could have done a better job..at least the acting was good..and parts were funny..the original had more meat to it..
3,"Content Wonderful, but disc only lasted 2 plays...","The Journey to the Center of the Earth is an excellent and relaxing movie and I thoroughly enjoyed playing it twice before it would no longer play on my LG-590. I though that it may have been a player update but it did not play on my computer either.Barring a bad disk that is not worth the hassle of returning it, The movie reminds me of the 50's and 60's genre but with updated set once out of the ""center of the earth"". I still watch it when it comes on TV, but still all in all it is disapointing about the disk.I look for any debris and dust as I take very good care of my optical disks but found none.I Recommend the movie but buy it locally where you can take it back for an exchange if you wind up like me. It's just not worth my time and money to send it back. I'll wind up buying it locally at BB or TRGT.I would have given it 5 stars except for the disk failure."
3,Journey to the Center of the Earth,"Not as entertaining as I would have liked, the 3-D at home was not convincing, but Brendon Fraiser looked very good in this movie. I'm glad I got it, but will not be playing it as much as my favorites."
1,journey to the center of the earth,"I just got my copy of Journey to the center of the Earth. Not only din't I get 4 pair's of 3D glasses, but I didn't even get 1 pair. Whats up with That?GJ"
4,Great kids movies 3D but Amazon has wrong description.,"I ordered this from Amazon and twice they sent me the 2d version only..After the second time I spoke to a Rep and he stated that after further investigation,Amazon only has the 2d version of this movie and when they get in the 3d Version they willsend out e-mails to the costumers who called in and will allow you to repurc hase the correct one..That is nice but STILL the wrong description is on their web site, they should at least correct that instead ofsteering new costumers in the wrong direction.Finaly I purchased the 3d version from Wal-mart and they also sent me the wrong disk 2d only but they quickly overnighted the correct one to me the 3d version.All in all the kids love the 2d version and the 3D version on my 60"" screen projection Tv."
5,I Am Now A Well Educated Lover Of FUNK !!!,"I recieved this book as a gift from my Fiancee, who is a FUNK musician. Many times he explained to me what FUNK is and how it began. My interest in FUNK music began to peak and I wanted to know more. I read the entire book in a 6 hour flight from the east coast to the west coast. The book was so informative I couldn't put it down. Prior to my reading this book I had no idea of the indepth history FUNK and the magnitude of its impact on the music industry. If anyone wants to know and understand the history of FUNK; I refer to this book as the ""BIBLE OF FUNK"". I am now a well educated lover of FUNK!!!"
2,Limited Value,"This volume exhibits all of the weaknesses of the early period of the Anchor Bible Commentary. The primary contribution is the author's translation and the textual notes, while exegesis of the text is sparse. Once Myers establishes what the text is, he seems to have little concern for what it means. All of this is quite similar to the volumes on Chronicles in the Anchor Bible series. In addition, now that this commentatry is 35 years old, many of the literary and historical assumptions which undergird it are dated. The commentaries on Ezra and Nehemiah by Williamson and Blenkinsopp are not only newer, but far superior in content and format. Even the older commentaries by Rudolph and Galling (though they have not been translated into English) are superior to Myers. Anchor has begun producing replacements for many of the earlier volumes. Hopefully, Ezra-Nehemiah is on the list."
2,Not That Good,It doesn't fit the PSP properly at least not the PSP 2. It holds a nice charge but you have to leave on a table or desk.
5,"Another Adventure for Flicka, Ricka, and Dicka","Everyone's favorite three little Swedish girls are at it again! Their agreement to watch Mitzi the cat for Uncle Jon and Aunt Helga turns into an unexpected adventure! Our children love all the Flicka, Ricka, and Dicka books and we (their parents) love that the stories are heartwarming and wholesome, always a springboard for us to explore new things (for example Life in Sweden, what is a chimney sweeper? etc.). We highly recommend this book."
5,nice faucet,"I purchased this to replace a similar off-brand that developed a crack that leaked and could not be repaired. I am very pleased with the appearance and craftsmanship of this faucet. Handles act smoothly and positively, and the valve that actuates the hand shower works just as well, totally diverting all water to the hand unit. Pleased with purchase and price."
5,Tub and Shower Faucet,"At first I did not think think the new faucet would fit. Take another look, followed the directions and now it works beautifully. Spray is good' flow is nice, and it looks beautiful."
1,Worst camera ever,"I bought this camera and with it being 4mp I thought this would be a good starter camera. When I opened the box I could not believe the poor quality of this camera, it looked like a cheap plastic childs camera that is worth about $10. The flash worked only when it wanted too and the buttons would stick. It also paused for about 4 sec. between pictures. The pictures were blurry so needless to say I sent it back. Please stay away from this camera. Very poor camera."
2,smaller than a stamp,man! this freaking parrot was so tiny i was... what? i thought it was going to be a real size one. what a desapointment. but instead it work out well as a addition for my pirate ship center piece.
5,Welcome Back Indeed,Excellent edition of Lovesong's finest. A perfect background music CD for every day of the week! Not sure what to give that special someone? Look no further.
2,It's just too bad,"It's too bad that this group had to remake all these songsin eighties elevator style. If you were into Jesus Rock inthe early seventies when Love Song made their original twoalbums (including many of the same songs), you might saythat the technical sound quality isbetter, but for me the soul is all gone."
4,"Good game, hard to play","This game has great graphics/sound/music/story line, just hard to play.I reccomend it to any star wars gamer though!!:)"
3,Wolo 3005-B Hawkee 2 Blue light,"Generally product is not bad, hawever needs improvements as follow:- turn off/on position on this switch- LED front/rear only activation, so it could be used in the cabin's windshield or rear."
3,Great for adults and kids who like campy movies.,"If you like campy, punny, spoofs you will love these screwball Martians. They are a laugh riot. This film is filled with great lines, so sit back, relax and ""Prepare to die Earth Scum!"""
4,Blast from the past,"Just from the synopsis on the box, you know your in for a kooky 90's flick. And it doesn't disappoint on that front."
1,Important Only in His Own Mind,"Despite the publisher's hype, it appears from this book that Sam Leach hardly knew the Beatles. He was a promoter who booked them and many other local Liverpool rock acts. But he gives no real reason to think that he had any influence on the Beatles or that he ever had a real chance of becoming their manager."
3,Spoilt by rear wheels,"The Scream Machine is well built, rides well, has very good brakes and was easy to assemble, it stops short of being a 5 star product by indifferent looking, noisy hard plastic rear wheels; a set of good rubber rear wheels would be a vast improvement. In fact I substituted the rear wheels with a pair of large diameter (7 inch) lawnmower wheels - easily done as the axle size is an exact fit so the only other addition required is a couple of spacers - with that alteration it is smoother, faster and quieter yet still well within the capacity of the existing front brake."
2,Get a Green Machine,"We got this for my son's 6th birthday, by the time he is 7 he will be too big for it. He is tall for his age, in the 95th percentile, so if your child is on the petite side it may be o.k. He has just been riding it about 15 minuites and a pedal broke, I'm not too heartbroken, we will take it back and get him something he can ride on longer. His sister got a green machine for her birthday, there is no comparison. I feel bad for him and will not replace this, just return it and get something better."
4,GREAT!!!!,"I dont understand some of these reveiws.. I am 28 years old and 2 of my friends and myself bought the scream machine for nothing but stupidity.. I have done 34MPH on these things, half pipes, ramps - everything against the mfg. warrenty - and It is lasting!! Dont believe me? goto www.brazenvideo.com - click on videos - watch the ""Freestyle Big Wheel"" video.. It shows how tuff these things are!My one complaint is tires are to thin and go really fast depending on how your child will ride this..."
5,Meg is a great teacher.,"I heard that Meg Swansen had a pattern for knitting gloves using I-cords.That is the original reason I bought the book. When I opened the book and saw the first project: ""Puzzle Pillow blanket"" I thought wow, that is so cool. It is a blanket throw, made of diagonals, and folds up into a convenient pocket and becomes a pillow. How charming, yet functional. The book is paperback with black and white photos, but the photos are actually so instructional, and the way Meg writes, you can tell she is a great knitting teacher. I must have been living under a rock, but I soon learned that Elizabeth Zimmerman was her mother. I don't yet own a Zimmerman book. I am anxious to try the I-cord gloves, and plan to use this book also as a knitting reference book, because of Megs excellent instruction skills."
2,Don't take a fake,It's a cheap fake soundtrack and the artists are not famous but maybe someone of you could like it
1,Broken right out of the box,"I enjoy having these things on my truck, and have been buying for the last two years. I first bought the deer, and then I went through a car wash with it. That was my fault. But lately I cannot get one to last long at all."
4,Tubbies fan!,My 2 year old twin boys are major tubbies fans. We purchased this tubby along with the LaLa one at full price of course! The tubbies are colorful and cute and have been a big hit with the boys. The only problem we've had is the electronic voicebox that is inside the velcro pocket in the back of the teletubby keeps falling out and it's a pain to get back in.Great toy especially at sale price of $7!
1,This one rates ZERO STARS!,"I've been collecting Old Time Radio shows for several years now. Quality always varies, but this is one of the worst transfers I've ever listened to. They apparently got carried away with the noise reduction and left no audio dynamics. The audio is flat and so muted, it's very difficult to listen to."
2,Good Time For A Spinoff,"To my knowledge nobody did a spinoff from this series featuring the detective duo ""Duchess and the Duke."" Their story in this collection is the highlight primarily due to the performance of Larry Haines as Johnny Duke. While there are some nice twists to some of the other stories most of the plots are predictable. John Dickson Carr comes off rather wooden as a program host for five of the episodes."
3,A standard bowl with an annoying rubber trim,"This is a good dog bowl that my dog has not tipped over, although he tends to be pretty well-mannered in his eating habits. I can't say that it's extra super heavy. Nor can I say that I'm in love with the rubber trim. It keeps coming off the bowl and can be difficult to put back on. Good size for my GSD and easy to clean, but all in all...just OK."
3,A great idea whose time has gone...,"Glass' opera is a monument to minimalism and is worth a listen-if you can stand it. Endless arpeggios-almost four hours worth! While it was an interesting experiment when it came out, and the use of minimalism to tell the story of Einstein, physics, etc, appropriate, this does not hold up well over the years. There is nothing here even remotely resembling a human emotion. What was once novel now sounds very cold and pointless. I have an electronic keyboard that can play arpeggio sequences for hours and this is just as mind numbing. Very much a dead end, but a clever one for its time."
3,Doesn't toast evenly.,"Like many other buyers, I can't get the toaster to toast evnely top to bottom and on both sides. Otherwise, it's a great toaster. Love the pop-up feature. I can get anything of any size out of the toaster."
1,dissapointed,loved it from the start...but now the little wires that support the bread and go up and down have bent and are jamming. It's less than a year old...this just should not be happening with a quality product. I won't do this again!
3,A Little Disappointed,"I purchased this item with the hopes that it would toast my bread with one try. Thought, because it's a big name brand and quite a few more bucks than your run of the mill toaster, it might work better.Nope!! I still need to put it down twice, watching it the second time or it'll burn, just like the cheap ones.Might be because we don't use the full-of-air white bread but whole and sprouted grain breads.Yes, the setting used is the highest. It's like most everything else these days, not made like they used to.Consequently, I am a bit disappointed."
3,A little dissappointed,I was dissappointed in the toaster because I like everything about it except for the main thing; it doesn't toast evenly. I always feel that I need to flip the toast around when it pops up so that the other side gets toasted more. It's very light weight as well and tips a little when you pull the lever down. I had expected a higher quality toaster than this from Krups.
5,Very satisfied,"I went through a cheap one, then an Oster, then a T-Fal. I couldn't believe I researched two-slice toasters for 3 days !You don't need restaurant quality.This Krups is great.Follow the directions in the user's guide and you'll have no problems."
5,The Best,"Krups FEM2B 2-Slice Toaster, Black & SilverMost toasters we've had don't toast evenly on both sides. This Krups does very well because there are 9 heating elements on each side of both slots and they are evenly matched by their brightness (I noticed our last toaster was weak on both inner sides). We especially like the feature that allows smaller cuts of bread to be raised higher than usual so you can easily grab it instead of burning your fingers or electrocuting yourself (or having to disconnect the toaster and use a fork). So far, so good. We hope it will continue to give us great pieces of toast and bagels. We haven't used the ""warming"" tray yet but when the time comes, we know it's there."
3,Toaster,"The Krups FEM2B is a ""good"" toaster, but not a ""great"" toaster.The handle used to lower the bread also tips the toaster over because there is not enough weight in the bottom of the toaster to hold it upright.The bread slots are wide enough, but need to be longer.I love the idea behind the handle, and it's a great way to raise the toast up so that you don't burn your fingers. They just need to design a way to keep it from tipping the toaster."
4,Our New Toaster,We are quite pleased with our new Krups toaster. We especially like the ability to raise the toast out of the holder.
3,"Okay, But!!!!","Toaster is okay but, MADE IN CHINA.Very lightweight and moves around the counter when the toast lever is operated. Toast shading is tricky."
2,"Really wanted to love this, but...","...it looks better than it works. Mine sits on the counter because it looks so cool, but although I am a serious tea drinker, this isn't the one I reach for. The polycarbonate (Lexan) is sturdy. So is the mesh. But the two aren't easy to put together--or to separate. The metal mesh bottom doesn't clean all that well, either.What I do like is the little holder which effectively eliminates drips. I also like the fact that you can stir with the unit--something you may need to do, because it doesn't infuse all that well. The top is solid, so that should have come as no surprise."
2,Cosmos are out ...,"and this book should go with it. I was not impressed at all. Basic. Enough to keep you reading to see if it gets better, only to be disappointed afterwards. Get this from library."
2,Uninspired and Insipid,"Knowing that Al DiMeola has recorded many fine, groundbreaking albums, Scenario comes as somewhat of a disappointment. Despite the two star rating, it is not a bad album. Its just uninspired and insipid. I've listened to it many times trying to find something exciting in the music but have failed each time. There is not a single song that stands out. Scenario is tolerable background music,but if you are a long-time fan of Al Dimeola and haven't yet heard this album, you are likely to be in for a big disappointment."
1,Stopped fuctioning after a month or so.,"This product (which the company discontinued for a reason) stopped working a month after I bought it. These ceramic heat emitters either work or they dont. I have bought several others, and had others break on me. WORTHLESS."
2,Disappointing Workmanship,"This item was sent as a gift. The original item arrived and the 'Shun' plaque on the front was glued on crooked. We tried to fix it ourselves but couldn't get it to budge. We requested an exchange, and the replacement item was actually worse. It was strangely larger than the original (significantly), it had several cut marks on it, and the seams where the pieces come together were not finished well. Overall, the quality was disappointing. Since the only problem with the original item was the crooked plaque on the front, we decided to keep that one and return the replacement item instead of the original. We will make another attempt to fix the crooked plaque ourselves, since the block is not terrible otherwise. Strange that the replacement item was so much larger (would not fit in the gift box that the original was sent in), and the workmanship was so shabby. We love our Shun knives, so we were surprised and disappointed by these quality issues."
4,Great collection of engineering stories -- with a point.,Petroski has again assembled a great collection of stories that illustrate engineering themes. As much about engineers as engineering. Recommended to engineers who want to know more about thier craft.
4,Great addition to your library,"The author, Henry Petroski, cooks down his vast knowledge here with an emphasis on the relationship of technology and the society which it serves. In these nearly twenty stories he chronicles accomplishments of engineers which are prelude to modern engineeing practice. These accounts of feats of engineering are very readable and gripping. The reader learns how engineering successes have influenced our lives in countless ways. In these essays, Dr Petroski, describes renouned historic structures, the engineering design process, and personalities involved that our typical histories have left out. I have read these adventures several times over and continue to return to them for their lessons. This collection gives a great opportunity for non technical readers to learn about numerous worthwhile achievements rarely covered elsewhere."
2,This album makes you pray for him to go back to his 70's style,"I've owned this cd, but didn't keep it for very long because it's too poppy and slick for my tastes. I guess when about 1981 came around Billy just wanted to distance himself from the brilliance of his 70's style, and on this offering, he kind of wanted a 50's or 60's kind of sound. This stuff is just to slick for this hombre. He never made a solid album, after the release of GLASS HOUSES, in about 1980. This is the kind of stuff that yuppies rave about, but if you've got some integrity, you'll probably want to steer clear of this one, and buy anything he recorded in the 70's."
2,An OK Even CD,"We have another CD with some good, some bad. Basically, the even tracks are the good ones, except for ""This Night"" and ""Keeping the Faith"", meaning only 3 of the songs are really good."
4,Billy Joel's tribute to 50's rock 'n' roll and 60's doo wop,"This is probably the only Billy Joel album where just about every song is a love song. But the songs are incredibly catchy and the vocals are great. ""The Longest Time"" has such great harmonies that the only instrument heard in the song is a bass guitar that is all it needs to pull it off. ""Christie Lee"" was clearly influenced by 50s rock 'n' roll. I'll probably have to hear ""This Night"" and ""Leave a Tender Moment Alone"" a few more times before I actually like them. But this is still a strong album and is worth owning because of the music videos on the enhanced versions. (Leave a tender moment alone..in concert, keeping the faith, tell her about it, and the longest time)"
4,Ripcord 1970,"I fought with B Co 1/327th Inf 101st Abn during this operation. Nolan has done a brillant job in uncovering every aspect of this engagement. He covers it all. I would like to thank him for proving that we as US fighting soldiers went above and beyond the call of duty many times. Its called e'sprit de corps, and I had the privledge of fighting with some of the best soldiers in the world. A must read to fully understand the Viet Nam war."
1,Does not work on Whirpool,"The dryer belt keeps slipping off the drum once loaded with clothes. The tension of the belt is not sufficient to carry load. If we add more than 10 t-shirts in the dryer, the belt slips off the drum and drum stops rotating.Did not do the job it was meant for."
5,Dryer Belt,"I am so thankful you made this available online. I tried to buy one in the shops and could not find one that would fit. I looked in many, believe me."
4,Works good bug started squeaking,"It works good but started squeaking. after a lot of troubleshooting, thinking that the motor or the drum wheels were going out, I figured out that it was the belt. I had some belt conditioner for my car. i sprayed that all over the belt as the dryer was running, solved the problem. Belt conditioner- great fix 4 stars because of squeak."
4,disappointed by different format than previously purchased mats,"I originally purchased two sets of playmats and was very pleased with the quality and overall effectiveness in protecting my little one from falls as he learned to walk. However, I am very disappointed that when I ordered an additional two sets to cover a larger area, these were a different size and did not interlock at all with the prior ones. All were from the same company and sold with the same description. There was no warning stating a change in size, and now I am stuck with a product that I cannot use unless I buy even MORE mats from them!"
4,Not perfect but they work...,"Pros: thicker than other playmats, larger pieces/squares, no alphabet or number cutouts to worry about, durable.Cons: not the most attractive color and no other color choices, don't fit/puzzle together super easy (but seem to stay together once you do link them), expensive (because you will need to buy more than 1 set of 4 unless you just have a small square area you want to pad)."
5,Play Mat,This mat is great! It's easy to clean and keeps my son safe from tumbles. I def recommend it!
2,Playmat too small and unfinished,This 4 piece playmat should have included edging pieces to make the edges straight; the playmat looks unfinished. Playmat is too small and not a good value for the 4 pieces.
3,I Did Not Hate The Film But It Was Unremarkable,"The protagonist of the film is shy and harbors romantic feelings for her roommate, but the Rocker roommate does not realize this.She [shy girl] meets a troubled heiress who sparks her interest. This film consists of 7 individual strands that are woven into a cohesive whole. Each strand is a chapter based on a word or phrase from a poem and each chapter in the film is directed by a different woman.I thought that this film was simply okay. I was not enraptured by any of the story lines. The shy girl actress does have chemistry with the actress who plays the heiress but surprisingly little with the Rocker chick that she is in love with. Some plot strands are left unresolved, but is that not life -- doesn't necessarily end with everything having been resolved."
4,Emotive !,"For anybody who loves track & field, this movie will be full of emotions. Well balanced between the story of the his live, human relationship between him and the trainer, history of the sport, technical details, and human feelings."
3,Its OK,"I rented this video and thought it was OK. I run trails and tri's, a High School or College runner may like it a lot better."
3,motivational ?,"If you are looking for a fair balance between biographical and motivational, then this is your book. However, if you you are looking for a strongly motivating audio-visual material (e.g. preparing for a race), the movie is just not enough. More workout scenes would have required. No matter, Jared Lareto is great. On the whole, it is worthwile buying this book !"
4,Surprisingly Good!,"Someone gave me this movie for free, and I let it sit on my desk for months thinking it was going to be a total bore. One day I stuck it in, because I had nothing else to watch. It was TERRIFIC, I was into it right off the bat and it never let up. Jared Leto was really excellent as well. If you're looking for a very entertaining true story, this is it."
4,"Better than ""Without Limits""-A Must See for Runners","Another movie that is a must see for runners of all ability. I would definitely say that I rate ""Prefontaine"" above ""Without Limits."" From the makers of ""Hoop Dreams,"" Prefontaine follows in the same footsteps and creates a docudrama that is unforgettable and very watchable-even to those not interested in the sport. The main cast, Jared Leto and R. Lee Ermey as the unforgettable Bill Bowerman, are really quite good for a film of this budget. ""Prefontaine"" follows Pre's story more closely than ""Without Limits"" and definitely offers more for runners to sink their teeth into.Admittedly, the film's appeal is probably limited to those who are truly interested or inspired by the sport of running (or know someone who is). But athletes of all sports will enjoy Pre's story of defiance and heart. If you watch one of the two films, I'd see this one."
3,It could be better...,"I bought this Teletubbie because I though that my little daughter would enjoy it... but when I give her the toy, did not like the toy... I think that the voice of the toy scares her a little..."
1,where is it,ordered this what feels like a month ago and have yet to receive it. so yeah that's happening. if you dont have it don't sell it
5,This book is my bible,"This book says it all very concisely, no fluff. I've written three business plans with it. Read a chapter in the book, write a chapter of the plan. The examples are very good. I just hit $1MM in sales on my third try - I give this book a lot of credit for helping me get organized."
2,First Disappointment With Perry,"Thomas Perry has been one of the most reliable authors for me in terms of good page-turning fiction, original characters and inriguing plot-twists that I purchased this book without reading any background info on it. What a disaapointment! The basic plot, while mildly intriguing, is much better suited to a short story than a full novel. As a result, you can almost see stretch marks on the prose as Perry drags his up-to-this book very interesting protagonist through a very predictable and slow-moving plot. My recommendation to readers is to read all his other books (all 4 or 5 star efforts) and don't go near this one. My recommendation to Mr. Perry is to bring back one of the other characters from his previous excellent efforts -- perhaps the Butcher's Boy or Metzger (the cat) and crew."
4,Jane Whitefield Strikes Again,"Jane Whitefield, the last hope of persons on the run, has promised herself to remain home as a housewife to her doctor husband, but gets caught up in another hide-the-person-on-the-run situation. The title of the book refers to an awful lot of the Mafia's money which Jane must help dipose of while helping a septugenarian and a teenager elude a manhunt consisting of almost everyone in the USA with an Italian surname. Although some of the plot points are a little hard to believe, e.g., a nation of Mafia families working as efficiently as the FBI to find Jane and her runners, and Jane's almost unlimited reserve of financial resources, Perry keeps the reader's interest as Jane and company race around country trying to turn dirty money into clean charitable donations."
3,Not like in the picture.,"Nice case none the less. Works for what i need it for. However, the case I recieved DID NOT look anything like the one in the picture, at all. The case looks good but probably not as sturdy as it would have been if it was all aluminum like in the picture."
2,9th Edition versus 12th Edition,"If you insist on buying the Lindeburg book for the PE, you might as well buy the cheaper version. I had both the 12th edition and this edition and the difference was miniscule. There were a few topics added in the newer version, but the overall odds of that changing your score is shadowed by the giant waste of time that this book ultimately is."
4,"Great idea, not so great fit","The idea of this product is perfect. My three week daughter hated being bundled in a snowsuit, making travel difficult, and she would sweat in the car. This is a great solution, but it doesnt fit very well on our Graco Snugride (Saratoga). It has lots of extra fabric on the sides that I just tuck under, but the hood makes up for any part of her neck or face that is showing. This way I can just strap her in with her clothes and/or a sweater and then add a blanket before zipping up the Wrap-N-Ride. I flip the hood down just for the quick time we're outside then flip it up in the car. It does stay if I tuck it under the canopy, but it still makes me nervous it will come down over her face."
3,"Nice and warm, but not very adaptable","We live in Michigan and will want a similar product, but we had to return the Wrap and Ride. We couldn't make it fit the 3-point harness on our car seat without a lot of bunched fabric under the baby. Too bad, because other than that, we liked it. The product could be improved if they were to change the top vertical slits for the harness into a 't' shape so that it could take either kind of harness."
1,DVD Release is an ILLEGAL BOOTLEG!,Be aware! No DVD release has officially been made for this concert. Any DVD you buy is a bootleg transfer from the VHS release and will be low quality! Don't waste your money!
5,One really great album,This was one of my first albums when I was 8 years old and I instantly became a fan. Now at the ripe age of mid twenties I still listen to her. And with a remasted cd including 3 live songs that propel her voice. Well this a a win win situation.
1,A hyped up diva,"Sorely disappointed by this album. Brightman's voice is monotonous and her singing style is boring to the extreme. There's never any tone colouring and her technique is clumsy. In some of the songs, her singing can in fact be pretentious. It makes one feel that she's a product of media hype rather than genuine artistry."
4,Not as instantly satisfying as Dive or Fly...still wonderful,I bought this Brightman cd without hesitation. It is a wonderful album. Not as satisfying as Dive or Fly or Timeless (could do without Dust in the Wind and My Heart Will Go On in Italian!) The rest of the cd is brilliant. Production is first rate and Sarah has never sounded better. A must for any Sarah Brightman fan.
5,So Unique!,"Sarah's style and her music are so unique. She has such a wide array of followers/fans because she creates things for all types of music lovers. She is so faithful by staying within her classical background, but she mixes in her own style that gives it a freshness and a very unique sound."
4,An Essential CD for Any Sarah Fan...,"""Eden"" is probably Sarah's most finely produced CD. I have followed her career since ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and have fallen in love with her voice and the way it makes me feel while listening to it. She truly treats and uses her voice like the instrument it is, and this is conveyed throughout the CD and in concert (I had the pleasure of seeing her live, which is what made me buy this particular CD). The music also arouses great emotion and is the perfect complement to her voice. However, although her voice is completely mesmerizing, one cannot get over the fact that many of the tracks are monotonous, making them seem boring and long. The first few tracks, in my opinion, are the best, especially #4, my personal favorite. If you are a true Sarah fan and are familiar with her style, this is an important addition to your library. The companion video of the premiere of her ""Eden"" tour in Sun City, Africa is a great buy as well."
1,A travesty,"Not content with disgracing opera, Brightman has to extend her toxic touch to pop music. Hooverphonic's original version of ""Eden"" is far more evocative than the showy, sugar-coated mess that is the title track of this CD."
2,The second time around is NOT always better in my books.,"Well, DUH! I knew this album went gold in 11 weeks. That doesn't make it any better than its predecessor, Time To Say Goodbye, which took over a year to hit gold status. And La Luna hit gold status in six out of 8 weeks, just on pre-orders alone, and went even further than the previous two. No doubt subsequent albums will go even further than that, possibly even #1. No, I'm not saying the album *****, I'm just amazed by its popularity."
5,Sarah Brightman - AMAZING Album,"This is one of the finest albums I own. Her voice comfortably reaches the altissimo octave and blends well with the background music. In my opinion ""Il Mio Cuore Va"" {Italian version of 'titanic'} was WONDERFUL, I think it sounds better in Italian, with this Orchestration and Sarah singing to it, so MOVE OVER CELINE!Great album!"
4,"""Eden"" - Ideal!","This album brings together 3 really memorable pieces of music(""In Paradisum"", Anytime, Anywhere"", and ""Scene d'Amour"") and a hauntingly lovely voice. A pure voice. No frills. A few tracks still have her doing her ""opera voice"", but by and large, if you are the type to enjoy fresh air and relaxation, then this CD is for you!"
2,Not at all impressed,"After much deliberation on my part I decided to Order a Brightman Cd and find out what all the fuss was about. I was unpleasently surprised. Sarah's voice, all though pleasent at first soon becomes annoying and titery. I would also say that although good, I am surpprised she got anywhere in life singing the way she does (a whole lot of air.)I'm sure fans will be pleased with this cd, but for anyone who likes the richness of opera music, don't bother."
3,Great for the price,and the clips held onto badges in a wild wind. They were just the ticket we needed for holding id badges.
2,Easy to break,"I had the armband system for about a week and the rubber piece that holds the MP3 Player ripped. The rubber piece needs to be much more durable, especially if this product is expected to be used during exercise/cardio activities."
1,Tears Easily,I know a lot of other reviewers have said the same thing but I'm guessing this item is no longer for sale (on here or from Sony) anyway. My case tore very easily in less than a year and there's no way to mend it. Too bad the case wasn't made out of other material. Now I'm having a really hard time trying to find an armband carrier that will fit my Sony E105 MP3 player. I'm only finding larger bands/carriers (like for ipods) or small ones (for stick players).
3,Sony Armband,Yes it tears and wears out. Mine lasted two years of abuse - working out three days a week then cycling and running the other days. Consider an alternative if you can find one. I'm buying another because I can't be without. I wear mine snug enough to stay on my arm and place it on my bicep or tricep (depending on activity) so it doesn't have to endure the side-to-side motion. This will help reduce the fatigue on the small silicone straps of the case. :-)
1,Not a good buy,I have purchased two of these and both have ripped beyond usability. Sony will not replace after 90 days.
4,Speak to me...,"Yeah speak... my teacher wanted me to read it because I'm quiet like Melinda. So I bought it and read it. After I found out that she was raped I thought to myself... is this why my teacher wanted me to read this book? She thinks I'm quiet because she thinks I've been... OMG no! That would never happen to me! The truth is, it could happen to anyone if they are not careful. Trying to be popular and get drunk at a very early age will lead to trouble.Just for the record, I have not been raped...ever. I'm too shy to even go out with my blanket... if that makes sense.Overall speak was a good book... yep.(end.)"
4,SpeaK,"This book was good, it defeinetly kept you reading though, so many questions to ask ,and they are all answered at once which i though was strange. i do recomend this book, its a light read, deep though."
4,Readers of all ages will relate...,"Just prior to the start of her freshman year, Melinda Sordino goes to a party that changes everything. Her friends will no longer speak to her, and Melinda finds herself unable to speak - her throat freezes up and her lips become chapped and raw. She creeps through her high school like a ghost, on the edges of life.Worse, no one seems to understand that Melinda is having serious problems and needs help. Everyone, from her parents to her teachers, just treat her as strange and troubled, demanding to know why she's suddenly ""decided"" to act this way. No one seems to wonder why a normal, happy girl would all but shut down.Anderson creates a believable character, ordinary in all ways yet remarkable in her silent suffering. Readers of all ages are bound to relate to Melinda, waiting for her to come to grips with the events of that fateful summer night."
4,R S H,I think this was a good book its shows how some people react with an event such as this.Then how Melinda was quiet and how her x-best friend was dating HIM. It also shows how some people will hate you for something you did and not no why you did it.i think its wrong how Heather treats her at the end. My favirote character besides Melli was the art teacher. i thinks hes cool because the way he.... he just so fileed with life. I would recommend this book to everyone its just great.
5,Worthy and Amazing book.,"SPEAK is an amazing and entrancing book that is a definite must read for anyone of any age. Once you pick it up and begin, you wont want to put it down! It is wonderfully written and it captures your attention from the get-go. Recommended to anyone and everyone!"
3,Speak,"Melinda Sordino starts a new chapter of her life in high school, but it is not what she has expected. Her friends refuse to speak to her, and Melinda suddenly finds herself isolated from those closest to her. Her grades slip, her attitude toward life degenerates, and her relationship with her parents has never been worse. A single, horrific event over the summer causes all of this, and Melinda is left to find a way through it.Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson is written very well. It reveals what true high school life is like, and it relates directly to today's teenagers. It is full of humor, but at the same time is a heartbreaking, depressing story. You will laugh and cry throughout this incredible story of a young girl's plight to find herself and cope with the event that has forever changed her."
5,beautifully written,To say anything other than that this book is a must read would be spoiling it. I highly recommend this book!
5,speak,"The story is about a 15 year old girl ,who goes through high school with a dark secret. The name of the girl is Melinda Sordio. Melinda was busted by calling the cops at an end of a summer party. Melinda was calling the cops for something else, something that happen to her so bad that she not safe anywhere. She can only be alone, but she can't be alone always because someday she would have to speak the truth."
5,An Excellent Theme,"The theme of Speak is quite depressing. It is about the troubled freshman named Melinda who was having a life filled with problems. For example, she had many adversities at school and with her family. For these reasons this book is one of the dreariest books I have ever read.The book only has the one depressing theme throughout. There is sometimes uncanny humor that sort of fits with the main theme. Sometimes Melinda wins at things, so that's why the book sends not only sadness but joy as well.It's very tense at times so the theme can get a little mixed up but never completely off. It just makes it more realistic because life is imperfect.The theme is well maintained and fits everything that happens. The author did a great job."
2,Didn'd like it,it had writing in it and it was all wrinkled. the only reason i got it used was because i needed it cheap and fast.
3,Library book?,"Length:: 0:50 MinsI'm not sure about this company. I received the book in a timely manner, and in 'fair' condition. ( The spine shows use and the corner of the front cover is torn off. It doesn't personally bother me too much though.)However, it looks like this book belongs to a library. I couldn't tell from the seller profile if working with libraries is something they do or not, but I've contacted the library to see if they're working with this company. I'm not sure- at gut level I feel a bit uneasy about it."
5,'No' Means 'No',"Not only was I able to read 'Speak' in one day, but I found it to be very liberating. I am a victim of rape...was a victim of rape...when I was 18...some 15 years ago. The silence will surely kill you on the inside in a way that the physical act could never do. Rape takes away a very important part of you..in my case and 'Melinda's', it robbed us of our virginity. The saddest part is that for a 13 year-old girl, the concept of the first kiss is still at arms length, let alone a physical relationship. I commend the author for sharing this story in a format that can bring inspiration and education to teens as well as adults."
5,Realistic,"This book moved me so much. Not because of the subject matter, but Anderson writes so that the reader is transported to Merryweather High where they feel and understand to pain of Melinda Sordino. After reading this book, and I couldn't put it down, I felt as if my friends had betrayed me. As if some guy name Andy Evans had used me too. An easy read, but once with such impact that it will stay with you for days."
3,3.5 stars actually,"Speak in the audio format feels realistic, as the reader sounds like a teenage girl whom narrates to us in the first person. She sarcastically and moodily goes through her disrupted life with the experiences of a typical teenager, and one whom has experienced a traumatic event. Its easy to sympathize with her as she fumbles her way through her cynicism, pain, and angst which are otherwise present in most untouched young people's lives. The audio book plays identically to the movie which was good, and had unfortunately watched before I listened to the audio book. Generally, I like to read the book before I watch the movie. I'd prefer not to read a book when I know its conclusion. It's more of a commitment to spend the time reading a book rather than watching an hour long movie, but I would say that this book was worth it."
4,Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson,"What do you think when you see an outcast at your school? How do you think they're feeling? Laurie Halse Anderson delves into the mind of a depressed teenager in Speak.The mood is sad throughout most of this book, because the protagonist is depressed. However, it is still hard to put down.It is Melinda Sordino's first year year of high school. Even before the first class of the year is over, she is an outcast. All of her old friends and most of the students at Merryweather High School hate her. Her art teacher Mr. Freeman reaches out to her and helps her express herself through art.I think this book is great for teens because we can all relate to it. Everyone knows the outcast at their school, and after reading Speak, they will think of the outcast differently."
4,Speak,"The novel Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson, is a mysterious story about a young girl's struggle though freshman year. Like other freshman, Melinda struggles with making friends, schoolwork, and peer pressure. But Melinda has a secret, something happened to her that no one knows about, and she won't speak of it.Anderson is really able to connect to teenagers in this young adult novel. Her word choice and narration style are very creative and well thought out. Anderson has also created a seamless plot that leaves you in suspense until the end. Speak is a must-read for any young adult."
3,False-Advertising,"The reviewers say that the book held them from beginning to end but I expected more out of this book then what was offered. It didn't get good until the end. This book really teaches you something, but I didn't think it was extremely great."
5,awesome,"I(...) thought speak was an excellent book. we had to read it in english, i couldnt put the book down. the story was just so well writtin, and her humour and charecter was great, i thought it was awesome and everyone should read this book, or make it into a movie, id go see it"
3,"Not bad, but definently not great.","Everyone seems to love this book! I didn't think it was all that great. It was sort of painful to read all the way through, and some of the text was a little dorky. Actually, most of the sarcasm was funny, but all of the negitivity brought you down. She didn't even talk about what was haunting the charactor until the las few chapters. All in all, Speak isn't a bad book. The text is a little too cheasy for older kids, and it is a little too... adult for younger kids. The story is a good one, but I don't like the way the author presented it. Maybe the author should retell the story."
1,Beware of offensive language and adult subject matter,"Melinda, a freshman, is considered an outcast at Merryweather High School because she supposedly busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops. The rejection and a traumatic episode give her a bad attitude about school, and her grades suffer as well. The traumatic experience is something she has hidden from everyone, but at an important opportunity, she talks about it and everything changes for her.This book should be for mature readers because of offensive language and adult subject matter."
5,Teen cruelty and teen depression captured perfectly,"Such a beautifully written book...the author developed her character so well, I really felt I knew her. I was terribly saddened by what she'd been through, but loved how the guy got his in the end. I love poetic justice. Ha! The author captured high school perfectly, especially that horrible mob mentality and how people will turn on you in an instant. That meanness, cruelty, pettiness. Frightening."
3,What makes someone not speak?,"Mel is a young girl who is a freshman in high school. The school year starts off by no one speaking to her or wanting to be her friend. But why? Thats the mysterious part that happened one summer before high school. The book was interesting in some parts but you had to connect who ""IT"" is and what happened. Some parts of the book made me not want to put it down because of this ""IT"" person and what he has to do with Mel. The rest of it was quite boring in my opinion because it would tell how Mel was so depressed and wouldn't speak because she had so many problems and no one would talk to her. All because of something that happened over a short summer. I think she just neeeded a friend to help let her secert out and luckly that friend was Rachel. In my over all opinion, I think young females should read this book because in a way it connects to them. Read the book to find out what happens to mel and why she chooses not to speak."
3,Speak,"I actually thought the book was good and it kept me interested the whole way through, but to me, the girl seemed like a depressed, gothic, careless girl. I couldn't relate to the story easily, and I felt the story had no plot. On the back of the book, it says about how she messed up a party in the summer, and now she has no friends at all. Then it tells me in the book that's she's speechless and stutters, and never speaks. I felt that neither of these things gave it a real story; with a conflict and resolution, and all that."
4,librarian in michigan,"I read this book to review it before it was put into our christian middle school library. I enjoyed the book, it had a great message and was a very good book. There is a mention about why she made the phone call. There is also some swearing in this book. My high school daughter also read it and we both agree this book is great for high school age readers."
4,Speak,"Speak is written by Laurie Halse Anderson. In short, it is about a depressed girl who bottles up her thoughts.Melinda Sordino enters the ninth grade with no friends. At a high school party over the summer, she is dillusional and calls the cops, busting everyone there. Only she and HIM, Andy Evans, know the truth. Because of this great misunderstanding, Melinda is labeled an outcast. Throughout the book, she thinks to herself and keeps her thoughts to herself. But she realizes that you can't do that, or else it will haunt you from inside.Aside from the point, this book does a pretty good job of describing a realistic high-school situation. Melinda's take on life is both depressing and mildly humorous. It is a little mature, so I'd reccommend it to teens and mature preteens."
4,Why 4 stars???,"4 stars because the book was great and had a great moral lesson and You may want to put the book down at the begining and never read it because it is boring, but before you do, please read this! Almost all books are boring at the beging, right? but why are they boring? because the author has to describe the life and problems of the main charecter. So please read this book it's great and teaches you a lesson, a good lesson."
5,Speak,Speak is a very dramatic book.Its a easy read and a fast pasted .This book keeps you asking qustions throught the book and answers them at the end.Speak is a grate book for teens and adults.I would recamend this book to any one.
1,This Book Stinks,"Our teacher is reading it to us and I am finding it very lame. I am a 16 year old female, btw, so this is supposed to be for people of my ages interest.....but....For starters: It is very predictable to tell ""what happened at the party"" (a big catch phrase in the book) by page 75 Melinda has given you enough clues to figure out the big secret. Melinda also is hateful. She critizises ""death junkies"", cheerleader, ""404's"", and other groups of highschool students.This is a very juvinile book. For a real story on rape i reccomend ""When Rabbit Howls"". This is a truly horrifying account of rape that drew a girl's mind to develop multiple personalities *has some explict content*But yes, I found Speak very very very dissapointing."
4,Speak,"Speak was an extremely intense story about a girl who keeps a harmful secret inside her that is so devastating she slowly begins kill her. She must learn how to speak up for herself in order to save her life and that of others in danger. This book is easy to read, yet the symbolism makes you think as it is intricately woven into the story. I enjoyed reading this book as it is very original and different then anything I have ever read. But don't just take my word for it!"
4,Laurie Halse Anderson Speaks Volumes with Speak,"I found this book intriguing to say the least. After the first few pages, I was captured. I could just imagine the scenes in this book actually occuring in the high school I attended. Anderson captured the language and actions of the young adults in her story. Even the thoughts portrayed by the main character were right on target. I can just hear the voice of a high school student coming through in this book.This book deals with many topics high school students face daily. It deals with family issues, peer pressure, cliques, dating, and social issues. I think every adult and young adult can find a character in this book that they relate to."
3,Speak Review,The book speak was a nice book to read. It didn't get boring and the thrills keep going. I believe that everyone should read it. THe book tells of modern day problems. This is what keeps the reader most interested. I would suggest this book to many people.
4,Self-esteem Matters,"Adults, adolescents and anyone who deals with adolescents will definitely gain insight from reading this book. As adults we sometimes forget how stressful it is to be an adolescent even in the best of situations."
5,!! :) A Good Book :) !!,Speak is the best book I've ever read. The story was very emotional and had alot of meaning put into it. The theme was a very important to the story and was important to everyday life. The story is told through the eyes of a troubled 14 year old freshman. She has many things going on in the world around her. She needs to worry about her grades dropping and how she is a social outcast. She is an outcast because she called the cops at a high school party after her eight grade year. She refuses to tell any one why and she has become completely mute to her parents.The story is quite humorus at times but the main subject matter is very mature. I would reccomend this book to children 12-15. I hope you enjoy reading the book Speak. I did!
5,Journey from light to darkness and back to light,"Laurie Halse Anderson writes a compelling novel about a teenage girl who suffered a rape at the hands of a popular guy at school. Melinda Sordino was raped at the end-of summer party with her friends. When she calls the police, they bust up the party, yet Melinda is unable to speak of the tragedy she had endured. Her friends think she has betrayed them and Melinda spends the next school year as an outcast. Slowly but surely she works through the pain and is finally able to confess what had happened to her when her ex-friend starts dating the rapist. This powerful story of a teenage girl's journey back to the light after much suffering will capture the heart of the reader. Melinda's courage and ultimate triumph over her demons will leave the reader cheering through tears. Anderson captures the heart-wrenching harshness of Melinda's struggle for acceptance of her peers and her self."
3,This book was interesting,"The Witch of Black Bird Pond, I thought it was an ok book. I liked it because it kept me reading and left me wondering what would happen next. I liked how all the people in the town staired at her when she wore her beautiful dresses and all they had were mostly plain clothes. It showed that she didn't mind being different then the other people. In the end I was glad she didn't marry William and her and Nat hit it off in the end."
5,Tunes of Glory,"Ronald Neame's battle of wits is a perceptive reflection of the British class system, revealing the dire consequences when two men of opposing wills, backgrounds and character collide in competition for the loyalty of the soldiers they lead. Both Guinness and Mills match each other's high standard, each delivering stunning portrayals of two very different men. Don't miss the jaw-dropping conclusion. An unsung triumph."
4,Soul and Fun,"Soul and pop duo Wham!'s debut album in 1982 brings me back to the memories during 1983 when I was still a teenage boy. In Japan their debut album was well received and the album went up to #17 in Oricon album chart. Radio often played YOUNG GUNS, BAD BOYS and CLUB TROPICANA and I love these songs even before they made it big in the U.S with the success of Make It Big album. Althogh hit tracks are fun pop fitting well for disco dancing, most of the tracks are quite soulful. Particularly their cover of Miracles' 1976 hit LOVE MACHINE shows their respect for rhythm and blues bands and their ambition at that time was one day they would be like them. George Michael later fulfilled his dream by being accepted by R&B; world and became one of most successful ""Blued-eyed Soul Artists"" ever.Verdict: Great soul and pop material.Rating: 87 out of 100Recommended for: 80s UK pop fans, George Michael fans, and music fans who love rhythm and blues works."
3,quality,"every product i've ordered through amazon had been great! quality of the product is usually excellent. but on the sigma 24-60mm, the quality is ok. the focus is somewhat soft and its comes out pixelated when blown up to 8x10. i have a sigma 18-200mm and the pictures are great. i read in other reviews that the 1 in 3 sigma 24-60mm has focus issue. unfortunately i through away the boxes so i cannot return it. otherwise, in the outside daylight the pictures are great.-rex"
4,Good but could have been better,The product works as expected but the screws they give you are not that long and didn't hold down the table mount. I had a mic on it and the screws came right out when I extended a 19in gooseneck. I repalced with longer screws but it would have been nice if they just spent the extra couple of cents on longer/better screws.
3,Annoyed,The brilliance of this book was ruined with the five editor notes preceding the ending. They interrupted and took me out of the story magic. Up until then I'd had really a good time. The notes made me pay attention to the storyteller instead of the story. And because it didn't start until 3/4s of the way into the book I felt tricked and had a hard time finishing.
4,Captures the feeling of getting there.....,"Having just returned from a trip on Route 66, from Chicago to Oklahoma, I thoroughly enjoyed this series....granted the video quality could have been better, but the pace of the ""trip"" and the overall production technics reminded me of my trip.....unharried and reminicent of pre roadrage! I plan on buying another for my road companion. Thank you Mr. Wallis!"
2,Myths that have Not been Debunked,"The first two chapters of this book deal with the two most wide-spread and most effectively used weapons against the church in modern times: the Heli-Geocentric controversy and Darwin's evolutionary myth. It is disappointing to see that this able writer has not dealt with either myth effectively. He not only has not debunked these errors, he has been taken in by them. He has added a new twist to them by advancing the indefensible notion that these myths are not really that far from the truth, because they actually ""elevate"" man rather than reduce him to insignificance. This is in complete disregard of the history of the serious damage that has been done by these myths. For the author these myths are not really myths, just misunderstood science.This book is not a worthy addition to a Christian's arsenal against the myths of rebellious men."
2,A book staler than10 year old bread,"This book is elevated to the status of a two because of the constant and erotic sex.Otherwise it's a one star book with dialogue which will nullify any sense of fun you may have with this book,Characters who will be forgotten in a second ,and a purposeless that's as bad as the nile is long."
2,Duller than most but more sexual,THIs book was capable of being a rockin dominitrix story with a sexy love story.AT LEAst that's what could have happened with this poor excuse for a funny book.THe book has absolutely no charms about it.IT feels like a very heavy and humid summer's day.THe character's aren't just doomed to unoriginality but to the primal lack of emotion and character.Dull characters combined with the disappointing story make this one not worthy of a 2.What does make it worthy of it's rating is the hot sex which is set periodically throughout the book.THis book deserves a mass burning for it's crappiness
5,van allsburg,"This is the fuuniest, most imaginative children's books I've ever read. This was the first Van Allsburg I was introduced to and I was hooked..."
1,Not as advertised,I was so diapointed in this book for several reason. One it was basic and the things it is suppose to teach I already knew about on my own. It was short and not in detail. The pictures are pitiful I was truly dissapointed. I am sure there are more books out there with better advise and know how. Don't buy this book save your money and spend it on a real book not a hald hearted try for one.
4,Great organizer,"I loved this planner. The tabs were a great way to keep things organized, but much like other reviews mentioned it would have been better if it was more customizable. I ended up getting a note tablet to keep inside it to keep up with notes, etc from different vendors. Some of the sections need to be updated. I mean in the age of computers are you really going to do your guest list in this book? I would add names during the day at work or as I thought about them, but the address lines were a waste.Overall this little book was great. It definitely helped and I got rave reviews from all the vendors for having everything together. The pockets were extremely helpful for pictures and fabric samples."
3,"Of the three mutes I've used, this muted the least.","I have used this mute, theHeavy Brass Practice Mute for Celloand theArtino Cello Practice Mute, and this mute was the least effective. I also found that you had to fit it correctly or it would make some notes louder than they would be unmuted! My favorite mute is the heavy brass one, followed by the artino. The heavy brass mute needs to be put on properly, though. You need to make sure it is quite snug with the bridge or else it will vibrate and it could potentially fall off while you are playing.All three of the mutes have the exact same slit sizes (for fitting your bridge), so if one of them does not fit your bridge, it is likely that your bridge is too thick."
5,An Awesome Film!!!,"My dad and I watched this at 5:00 in the morning today, and I thought it was really good! It has a great storyline, great message, and great actors! On Larry Burrow's 35th birthday, he is really depressed and fired from his job because he found out that one of his co-workers will cripple the company that he works for. He goes to a bar and talks to the bartender named Mike. Larry blames all of his problems on a baseball game he lost 20 years ago. When Larry drinks a special mix of drinks, he is transferred to an alternate reality where he is rich, the boss of the company, and he has another wife. He likes it at first, but then he realizes that he wants his old life back. I highly recommend MR. DESTINY!!!"
5,My Husband's favorite,This old movie are childhood favorites of mine. It is a joy to view it in the comfort of your own home.
3,dell battery,Received Dell battery and was charged 52% I continue to get it charged to 100%but only manage to get up to 90% Lithium Ion laptop batter Inspiron6000
1,Only charged to 21%,"The Good : Received the battery in good time. Good price. It fits properly, and I liked the idea of a charge indicator button on the back.The Bad : I have two dell laptops with the similar chargers. I can switch them with the notebooks no problem. The first charger would not even light up the charge indicator. The second appeared to be charging the battery. A check the next morning showed a 21% charge. Not a good sign. Several hours later the same 21%. I'm sending it back as I write this."
5,works perfectly,"I followed the directions of letting the battery drain completely down, and then charge completely before actually using it.4 hours on my first full charge! Wow, better than the original Dell ever was (usually 2.5-3 hrs. before it died).Works perfectly so far!"
1,Poor choice,"Thanks for the fast delivery, however, once installed in my laptop the battery only lasted a short time, @ 3 days, and it will not accept a charge."
3,You get what you pay for.,This is a nice replacement battery. The battery does not last as long as indicated in the description but it works well.
2,Doesn't last for an acceptable time,"This battery worked well for the first year or so. Recently, after 16 months of use, the battery now does not support computer operations for more than a few minutes before failing. It does not give a low-battery warning, but just fails and the computer crashes. The LEDs on the battery still show a full charge, but the computer will not turn on until plugged in. After it has charged back up a little, it will work properly, but again for just a few minutes.I won't recommend this battery or buy it again."
1,battery for Dell Laptop,Almost unusable. Will not charge more than 75%. When discharged to 59% it fails and turns the computer off. Worse than the DEAD battery i already had
4,works very well.,I didn't use this for a sump pump. I used it for a recreational prospecting hand dredge. These were much less expensive than at the home improvement stores here. They work great!
3,Just like the title says.,This was as basic as the title states. Professor referred to some of the pictures but better information that is more up to date can be found on the internet.
5,High quality hanger for guitar hero/rock band guitars,"Perhaps this item is overkill, but I purchased two of these to hang guitar hero/rock band guitars for Playstation 2 inside of a wooden armoire. These are perfect for that function as the width between the arms of this hanger fits either guitar neck perfectly. In addition, the arms can be bent to some degree to hold necks of different sizes. Obviously, those guitars are not nearly as heavy as a ""real"" guitar, but I think I would feel comfortable putting a lot more weight onto these hangers. I would be worried that the screws would pull out of the wall before the hanger itself would break, and that is only because I used smaller screws so they wouldn't punch through the sides of the armoire.If you are looked for a solution to hang your ""guitars"" up and out of the way, these may be a good option."
1,Too political and patriotic,"If you love political and patriotic poems, this book can be a good choice, but such themes are complete turn-off to me. This book comprised of the following chapters: The American genocide, World War I, Revolution and Repression in the Soviet Union, Spanish Civil War, World War II, The Haolocaust, Repression in Eastern and Central Europe, War and Dictatorship in the Demditerranean, War in the Middle East, Repression and Revolution in Latin America, The Struggle for Civil Rights and Civil Leberties in the US, War in Korea and Vietname, Repression in Africa, Revolution and the Struggle for Democracy in China.I can hardly believe that these are poetries. These are simply political phrases disguised using poetry form. All the poems are so boring to appreciate. I find that it is much better to read the books relavant to each chapter. I regret that I wasted money and time on this book. In fact, I threw this book to trash."
3,Pretty good installment of the new wrestling CD craze.,"This new album, World of Wrestling Rocks, is a nicely put together CD. The only problem I had with it was that it was generic. If you are looking for well duplicated versions of the originals, then buy it... but if you were disappointed with Slammin Wrestling Hits (I know I was), then leave this baby on the shelf."
4,GOOD IDEA,"Good idea to hear people trying to justify this vile term. It's a shame that so many just don't get it. There can never be anything positive about this word. And one of the subjects, after doing all he can to make the term seem harmless, has to admit that if a white person called him that he would feel some kind of way. In the words of Spike Lee 'WAKE UP!'"
3,Training Methods for Hunting Dogs,"Enjoyed reading this book. My water dog is a domestic city dog. He loves stuffed toys, absolutely goes nuts over them. If I were a hunter and wanted to train a hunting dog, this book is a good place to start."
5,Water Dog,This book is THE book to use to train a retriever. Follow the steps exactly in this book and you will get amazing results. I used it to train a lab mix puppy that i got from the humane society and she is behaving just like a high dollar retriever. You will not be sorry if you purchase this book.
5,Great book for dog training,"My brother has had this book for many years. He's had several labs and has had great success training his dogs for hunting, using this book. We have borrowed this book from him several times for our own dogs. We just got a new puppy and again, my husband borrowed the book to re-read and use for training purposes. I finally decided to buy this book along with two others by the same author so we have our own set of books for reference for training our new puppy. It is a great reference and training book."
