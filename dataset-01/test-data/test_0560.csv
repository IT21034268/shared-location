3,"Heroine OK, Hero is worth the read.","It has been said that this is a long but quick read -- I began to skim some about half way through. I think that in many ways there could have been some serious editing down to about 400-500 pages at most here. The dreaded torture scene near the end is really not that bad -- this was the 18th century. They are just getting out of the Dark Ages! (Have you seen the movie Braveheart?) My complaint about this book is that the heroine Clare can get a bit tedious at times. The same words are put in her mouth over and over again, can't she say this stuff another way, if at all? She is supposed to be ""spunky"" but at times this spunk is annoying. Yes, she IS stressed, but the excessive alcoholic intake might be a contributor to some of her problems, and poor judgement, at times. Nonetheless, I am glad there are sequels, because it is an interesting story line and I want to know what happens next!"
5,Outlander,"Romance, time travel and history don't get better than this! I almost put this book back on the shelf because it was big and written in the first person, but bought it anyway. For the next week, I had a difficult time working on other things because I couldn't put it down. Even so, I don't regret my purchase for one minute.The author brings Scotland's past and the clan MacKenzie alive; you feel as if you know them all. Claire is a wonderfully intelligent and resourceful woman who is easy to identify with as she gives her heart to Jamie (what woman wouldn't?)and makes difficult decisions given the situation she finds herself in (200 years in the past!) The book does get detailed at times, but is so intelligently written it's to be appreciated.I had already been planning a trip to Scotland and Ireland next year. I'm seriously thinking about sticking to Scotland - must be those kilts, ye ken?"
2,Fair,It was very short...alot of the details to the story were left out...I read the book three times and I wish they had the story in the unabridged audio....I like to read the series each time a new book comes out...I thought the audio would be a short cut ...but not worth it because the whole story is not told...I thought the abridged version sucked....
5,Outlander,"I've read all of Diana Gabaldon's books at least three times. They're so rich with detail and so well developed you can get lost in her books. One thing I like is that even though it's listed as romance, it isn't smut, there's a whole story behind it and it isn't just about the character's romantic relationships."
5,The characters become part of you,"You are no longer sitting in your living room ""reading a book"", you ARE Claire Randall. One of the best series I have ever read, just ordered the 20th anniversary edition as my paperback is falling apart from being read to much. Best books EVER!!"
2,I HATE this heroin,"I Never write reviews, however I just had to say how I found this double crossing self centered heroin simply UNBEARABLE!"
3,Popular profanity and overly explicit sex ruin the good writing of this bestselling author,"I'm sorry, even though this series went to the top of the NY Times bestseller list it is totally un-classical, trendy, popular trash literature. I finished Outlander with this opinion, but the author writes well so I decided to give her a second chance and I started reading the second book. However Jamie, a character supposedly from th 1700's, just became totally unbelieveable to me as he blurts out a string of 1970 hippie profanity that is even out of place for a 1950's educated nurse. After reading several well written classics (War and Peace, Jane Eyre, Le Comte de Monte Cristo etc) the profanity and the overly explicit sex in this series made me decide to give it up. Trendy, popular garbage...maybe satisfying to fad readers but I just can't buy into a historical novel that is not one!!!"
5,Absolutely the best,"As a law student, I needed a break from reality last summer. My mother-in-law gave me Outlander - that was all it took! I have now read all 4 of her books 3 times and they get BETTER every time! Can't wait for the next two in the series!"
1,Too Dark and Disturbing,"I'm not normally a romance novel reader so I hesitated to buy this book. The time travel element seemed interesting so I decided to give it a try. I knew it had some explicit sex scenes so that part of the book wasn't surprising. What was surprising was how dark the book went towards the end of the story. For the most part, the book is very light-hearted. It pretty much follows the standard romance novel playlist: boy meets girl, they don't like each other, they fall madly in love, a 3rd prty intervenes and causes problems, in the end they get back together and there is a happy ending. The difference here is when the husband is tortured and repeatedly raped by a military official! Hello, this book left the tracks toward the end. There's no reason why this story had to go so dark and disturbing. Adding those scenes did not make this a better story; for me it ruined it. I cannot recommend this book and I will absolutely not be reading the rest of the series."
2,YAWN!,"This book was highly recommended to me twice in two days. I took it as a sign. I checked out the reviews here, and thought I'd found a great read.WRONG!I liked the beginning, it all sounded promising. But soon after the travelling back in time I started getting bored out of my mind by the shallow Claire who lives on like nothing extraordinary just happened to her. I kept on reading, though, hoping something would happen soon.Wrong again!There are way too many useless and boring scenes. I rarely give up on a book, but upon reading, and agreeing with the one, two, and three star reviews, I decided to end my suffering. Reading should be enjoyable. I don't see the point of forcing oneself to finish a book, hoping it will get better, when it feels like a chore to do so. I'd rather grab another book and have a good time."
2,Too many repetitions of the same scene,"I know it is a very popular book, but I really had to force myself to finish it. The plot is intriguing but I felt that I was reading the same chapter over and over again. Too much violence, too many beatings, and too many love scenes. Will not read the rest of the serie."
5,Romance for the Intelligent,"Although I love a romantic tale, I have often found romance novels to be predictable with poor dialogue and unbelieveable plots. This book was nothing like those.The author is an expert crafter of words. She educates without making the reader feel ignorant and does not explain things that readers know. She has taken great pains to create an accurate picture of the times she writes about and presents beautifully written dialogue with a Scottish dialect the reader can almost hear.I was completely swept away in the story line. The heroine is strong, resourceful, and easy to relate to. The hero is strong, sensitive, and immensely attractive.I highly recommend this book. I borrowed someone else's copy, but am buying my own so I can reread it. All in all, a very satisfying read!"
4,Diana Gabaldon's Outlander Series,"This is one of those series everyone seems to have read years ago except for me. It is what I read in between my ""literary"" adventures-- but what an adventure it is. Time travel, Scotland, History, Love... The whole series is a lot of fun. Very escapist. Definitely not for teens."
3,Good For Fans Of Historical Romance,"First of all, this book was long and there were a few parts that my eyes started to just skim over the content and before I knew it I was lost and had to go back and reread sections. Also, other than the time travel aspect there is very little ""fantasy"" in the book. I'd definitely rate it more of an alternate history/historical romance, which is really not my thing.But for all that, I thought it was a wonderful story overall. There were so many characters and they were rich and lushly described in both appearance and through actions. Jamie was my favorite of them and of course the sadistic Randall was my least favorite but both were fleshed out to where they felt real. I liked Claire (magnet for trouble though she is) and the book raised some interesting questions about the impact her actions might have on the future ... without giving any answers.It's not my normal fare but I have to admit I really did enjoy the book once I got into it."
4,Enthralling,I didn't know what to expect when I first picked up this book but I found it to be quite the page turner. I was hooked fairly quickly and thoroughly enjoyed the story.
2,What in the hell was that?,"If you are a male, do not under any circumstances read this book. I was tempted (tricked?) by the time travel premise into thinking this would interest me as an avid science fiction slash historical-piece fan. Instead I was treated to, in order of appearance: sex, sex, time travel without explanation, sex, almost rape, sex, almost time travel, sex, sex, violent rape, sex and sex. The end. Maybe this sort of plot is common place in ""romance novels,"" but it's definitely not for me. The only reason I didn't give this book one star is because it did motivate me to learn more about The Jacobite Rebellion, which was/is an interesting historical subject to me."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"Tried my hardest to enjoy this book. I continued to find myself skimming than actually reading. Seemed to drag on for too long. I was hoping to be captivated, but was left wanting. Couldn't even finish it. Had to move on to another book to fill the void."
4,First book in Outlander series,"Actually bought first three books in this series. Will keep me busy for quite awhile! Really like this book so far, not a fast reader and have limited time but so far it has been something I would suggest to friends or anyone."
5,ENTHRALLING!,"Thankfully, I am a latecomer to Diana Gabaldon. I don't think I could stand to wait for each sequel. A girlfriend and her mother HIGHLY recommended the series so I purchased book 1. There are not enough adjectives to describe these novels. I am hooked, and have made several frantic searches and subsequent desperate dashes to the nearest bookstore upon completing a book. I couldn't wait to pass them on. My mom has refused to accept any past the first book as her house was in shambles.......book good, housework BAD!!! These are truly the absolute best books I have read in my 33 yrs as a reader. Currently on #4 and I am already looking forward to reading them all again...... A DEFINITE MUST-READ"
3,Mixed bag,"The author's writing style is enjoyable and the tale has possibilities, but I found the characters flat. Ms. Gabaldon doesn't allow her characters to experience the consequences of making difficult moral decisions. She presents them with a moral dilemma, has them make a choice, and the ""works out"" the storyline to remove any negative consequences. Perhaps because of this, her characters don't grow or learn throughout the book. They are pretty much the same at the end as they are in the beginning, although their situation has changed. If she had allowed them to face those negative consequences and be changed by them, I would have enjoyed the book more."
2,Unusual plot,Some of her timelines were not correct so it concerns me that what else does she have incorrect. But the story has an unusual plot which is an interesting read.
4,Great escapist vacation reading,"I read 3/4 of Outlander on two flights and on a 3 hour layover in an airport! I could not put it down. It is exciting, romantic and the characters come alive. I rushed out and bought the rest of the series to find out how Claire and Jamie fared. I commend Ms. Gabaldon because despite the danger imminent in every chapter, I wanted to be Claire so I could experience the earth-shaking love she shares with her Highlander, and for once, it is nice having an intelligent, resourceful heroine."
2,"Cheap, repetitive, boring, potboilerish ROMANCE NOVEL","This is one of those books that so many people seem to love, a book that is supposedly head and shoulders above its competition. And that may indeed be true, because the competition for this book is really crappy romance novels. Really, take any trite romance novel, throw in some very forced time travel, add a dash of research to give it a veneer of historical verisimilitude, and you've written a Diana Gabaldon book. When I realized that I was waiting for it to start wrapping up because I wasn't sure how much more I could take, only to discover that I was not yet halfway through the book (I was reading it on a digital reader), I just had to put it down. Maybe it got better in the second half, or maybe it had a great ending that somehow redeemed the first half, but BROTHER, was that a slog! One of the most overrated books I've ever (halfway) read."
5,Snob no more!,"There was a time when I wouldn't have been caught dead in the Romance aisle at my local bookstore. I have to admit to being somewhat of a book snob - reading strictly ""literary"" fiction and looking down my nose at people who read what I would call ""fluff"". No more. I picked up Outlander grudgingly after hearing everyone in my reading group continually rave about it. These are intelligent women whose opinions I truly value. Am I ever glad I listened to them. I can't remember the last time I had such fun reading a book! Since finishing, I have made 3 more trips back to the Romance aisle (with my head held high) to buy the next three books in the series. Even if you don't think Outlander sounds like your ""type"" of book, give it try. You might be pleasantly surprised - I was."
5,loved it!,"I have read this book a few times, and I think it's the best of the series. Looking over reviews, it seems a lot of people are really unhappy with the whole ""wife beating"" issue. Granted, it was graffic, and I DON'T condone it, but lets face it, Jamie is a product of his time, and saw nothing wrong with it.This book isn't for everyone, and if someone is expecting a true romance novel, they'll be disapointed...but if you're looking for a historical fiction with some romance/hot sex in the mix, read it!!"
1,wife beating as romance?,"I was absolutely enthralled with the first several chapters of this book--and with the hero, who seemed just fabulous. Then, he beat the crap out of our heroine. I read on enough to realize that this was not going to be the end of their relationship--in fact, she said 'I love you' for the first time soon after! It is one thing to acknowledge that violence against women may have been more accepted in the past--that doesn't mean you have to romanticize it. A brutal story, a brutal disappointment, a terrible waste of a Sunday afternoon."
3,"A great story, but very disturbing at the end","Diana Gabaldon has created a page-turner, I loved the combination of romance, well-researched Scottish history, and tongue-in-cheek humor. However, I was very disturbed by increasing amount of graphic sexual violence at the end of the book, as well as hints at it throughout. As another reviewer pointed out, I realize that these were violent times, but descriptions of sexual violence totally detract from the book. I didn't finish it because of this, and almost didn't read the next one in the series, despite the fact that I was hooked on the overall story. But I did go on, and I'm grad I did. Dragonfly in Amber is terrific. Bottom line - for readers that are disturbed by excessive violence, skim the sections that are disturbing at the end, and plunge on to the next book in the series. You won't be sorry!"
5,Stop Looking!,"We all have a few books that stay with us throughout our life. This book is one of the few. Strong, vivid characters, beautifully researched and accurate. Evolving and captivating love affairs. Real struggles laced in a fantastical world that seems like it must be true...Even though there are many books in the series, take your time! The critique that I have of this books, is sadly, that they have to end. Enjoy!"
4,Romance,This book was a terrific combination of time travel and romance. It was a delightful Scottish romance which kept the reader interested almost all the time. I enjoyed it enough to be looking forward to the next book Dragon in Amber. Jamie and Claire are terrific characters that you really end up caring about.
4,"""Outlander"" the best","While this audio book has over 15 discs, it is such a riveting story, it is most worthy of the time spent listening to it. The book is well written and Davine Porter is great!"
2,Homophobic AND Mysogynistic All in One Package,"I could deal with the fact that the villain, Jack Randall, is gay but the strong implication, no sorry, it's more than an implication, that gay men are both evil AND rapists offended me beyond words.Then we come to the misogyny. Jamie beats up Claire. Now, yes, men did sometimes beat their wives. It was quite legal, but not ALL men beat their wives and as a 20th century woman the fact that she accepted it as something she deserved shoved the novel right into misogyny.I will never buy another of her novels--never.I do not pay for hate literature."
5,Best Book Ever,"This book has everything - romance, history, wit, humor, drama, love, you name it. You will be completely transported into Gabaldon's world - believe me, you won't want to leave it. At first you may be put off by knowing that this is the first in a series of 7 REALLY BIG BOOKS. Then you will be incredibly thankful that the story keeps going and you can lose yourself again and again. I can't recommend this book strongly enough."
2,the outlander,This book for me was a little too far fetched. It jumped from one character or place and time era to another.
1,Wife-Beating is not Romance,"Half-way through this overlong novel, Jamie beats his wife (""half to death"" she says) and later confesses that he enjoyed it. Claire's rapidly accepts that she ""deserved"" the beating. I don't care what the historical context, this is SICK! This is the first romance I have read in years, and it will be the last. The violence in this novel is appalling and I cannot believe all the rave reviews."
5,Can read over and over,This is a great start to a great series of books. I fell in love with Jaime and Claire and couldn't wait to read the next book.
5,Amazing! Even the second time you read it!,"I have now read this book twice, and the other books in the series once. I get lost when reading this book in the amazing details that the author puts in. You feel like you are inside the story. Sometime in the future I will probably read it for a third time."
4,Couldnt put it down,"I usually dont pick these kind of books but this one is really god. For those who were misled by the violence, I think it is because it was and still is shelved in the Romance section of so many bookstores. It is not your typical romance where nothing bad ever happens. But, oh what a wonderful adventure awaits you if you give it a try!!! One of my all time favorite books. Beware, this is not a book for the weak stomached. This book is engrossing and one of the most unique novels ever. I've noticed some of the reviews talk about the level of violence, and yes it is a violent book. It is set in a violent time period. You'll not find any posh drawing rooms with people playing cards."
1,More S&M than romance,"There once was a laddie named Fraser,who bedded a wife, then beat her.All's well in the end - he's buggered, butt not sinned,For Claire didn't marry nae cheater.Lot's of action that lends little to the plot, and there's even more rough sex that detracts from the drawn-out story line. Don't bother unless you're turned on by stories of child and wife beating and graphic, perhaps, homophobic description of male rape."
4,beautiful and entirely heart wrenching.,"Although the plot style is not typically my preferred style for romance (not so much a fan of older women with younger men, and time travel) - this book is amazing, and honestly everything I heard it would be. The time travel is done very well, and the book is filled with historical detail that makes it not only wholly romantic but also very intelligent. Claire & Jaime's romance is beautiful - they fall in love slowly but so wonderfully, despite the husband she left ""behind"" in the future, and some demons in his past. Their adventures are fun if sometimes disturbing. The pages will fly by. Beautiful!"
2,Boring,"I usually don't like giving negative reviews, but since a million people love it, i don't feel so bad. I bought this book because of the great reviews, shocking! I got up to page 200 or so in the last 3 months...forcing my self to keep reading waiting for something good to happen. It is sooooo slow and boring waiting for her to get out of that time zone, im a bit lost in the book too because my mind keeps wandering elsewhere because i'm not really enjoying it....i dont think i can even finish this book even if i tried thats another year of my life. It seems interesting but it's like watching a 10 hour movie...you get the point..."
4,If You Love Time Travel...,"This sure is quite a book. WW2 is over, and Claire is reunited with her husband and they are on a second honeymoon.But Claire's life is changed when she fell through a stone circle and woke up in 18 century Scotland. Claire meets Jack Randall, her husband's evil ancestor, and is rescued by James Fraser and co. And that's when the story really starts.It's such a good book, the best of the series. Fantastic, really. You'll laugh, you'll cry and everything inbetween. The people she meets are remarkble. Diana Gabaldon introduces us to very unique people. I tought it fun that I could relate most of her characters to people I know. An amazing read for the time travel adventurers like us! It deserves 5 stars but I took off one because I found that I could never really personally relate with Claire, and I could of done without the 'incident' towards the end. But aside from that, it's great. It truly is a remarkable tale."
1,Thought I had the wrong book.,"So many people actually like this book that I couldn't believe I was reading the one they were talking about. I actually rechecked this online and by Googling TWICE. Unfortunately, this was the right book.This is the most depressing book I've ever read and the second most boring. In addition to being depressing, the characters are so fake. Nobody in the book seemed believable enough to interest me.I only gave it one star because there is no choice for zero stars. Very disappointing."
5,Best Series of books ever writen!!,"This is the only series of books that I have read that I absolutly missed the characters after the book was finished. I have never conected with the characters of a book before like I have with these. Don't let the nuber of pages scare you away. After reading all the books in the series, I have come to the conclusion that there weren't enough pages!! I am eagarly awaiting her next book to come out. This is money well spent. If I were buying them all over again, I would have got the hardcovers. They are truly brilliant books. Well done Diana and keep it up!! Some of us just can't wait to see Jamie and Clair again!!! Sincerely Dayna Brown"
1,I couldn't finish this book,"While I was travelling this summer, I found myself in a hostel in Europe wanting something to read. I picked up a beat-up old copy of this book from a shelf in the common room and started reading...and realized why I never wanted to pick up a romance novel again. Maybe it was because I didn't have time (or any desire whatsoever) to finish Outlander, but I don't understand why everyone says the characterization in this novel is so great. I found the main character's husband a particularly predictable, one-sided character. The main character herself irritated me, as did the author's complete inability to write a Scottish accent, and her insistance on using some form of the word ""highland"" on almost every page."
5,The best book I've ever read,"Outlander is quite possibly the greatest book I've ever encoutered. Her story is truly too enthralling for words, her characters are vivid and completely three-dimensional, and her writing style is simply beautiful. As a debut novel, and written by a research professor, Outlander is nothing less than a masterpiece. Jamie and Claire are wonderful! It's no wonder that so many people are so obsessed with Gabaldon's books! Don't let the size scare you! In fact, once you've read this book, you will have to read the others...over and over again. This is a story worth savoring."
5,"If you love Scotland, history and passion, this is it!","I finished this book in 3 days. Couldn't put it down. If you love Scotland, history and the passion between a man and a woman, this book is for you. Claire travels back to the mid-1700s by sheer chance, and meets the true love of her life. She eventually adjusts and ends up married to Jamie. What a man! They don't make 'em like that anymore. This events in this book seem very real to me. I usually read history, biographies, and other non-fiction. But this is definitely one to get into. I can't wait to read the next one! Thank you, Diane Gabaldon."
2,"boooring silly romance, not for me, thanks !","I found this book incredibly boring. I had to fight to get halfway through it, luckily the ending got a little more interesting. I can't believe my eyes if there are people saying this is the best book they have ever read. Just know that this a a simple romance book (Claire can't keep her hands of Jamie and vice versa, they make love, they fight)with a little adventure (for sure not enough). I don't understand why she needs 850 pages to tell her story. Why didn't we hear from Frank, how does he feel? I wouldn't even recommend it for light summer reading and for the same reason, I will not read any of the sequels. THIS IS ONLY FOR ROMANCE READERS."
5,Amazing!,I've only read two books this year that I could describe as spellbinding. The Triumph and the Glory. And Outlander. WOW!
2,One page ruined all,"I lost all interest in this book the second Jamie physically abused...sorry, 'punished' Claire. All positives about this book went out the window.I understand the era and how things worked back then but this is a book. These characters aren't real and the situations aren't real. I feel as if the author could have completely skipped that part. It was just too uncomfortable for me.I tried hard to keep reading but I couldn't. If you can somehow stomach the fact that Jamie hit Claire (and left bruises) then by all means read Outlander.The only thing keeping this book from a one star rating from me is that Jamie seemed to be a pretty adorable guy. At first."
1,Outlander,"I was not impressed, this is not the kind of fiction that I enjoy. I am sure others like it, as it came recommended from coworkers. But not for me, I did not finish it."
3,Outlander book,"Book is very well written, but was very surprised and shocked at the sexual detail of the characters . . ."
3,"850 pages, only last 300 were worth the read","I am not a great fan of romance, but the super positive reviews made me buy this book. From the reviews I had the impression this was not just another romantic story. While reading, I regretted my decision, but I never stop a book in the middle, so kept on reading (even though 850 pages) and it got a little better by page 350. I found the beginning very slow, not to the point and pretty boring. Halfway the pace got a little better, but altogether I found the book missing action and credibility. The ending really made up for the first 350 pages, but I will not buy any of Ms. Gabaldon's sequels."
5,One of the most entertaining books I have ever read!,"Outlander, the first in the Old World trilogy, begins a story that still beckons to me. I read this book 2 years ago and it is still one of my all time favorites! The characters created are so real to life and the time travel so believeable that they inspired me to visit Scotland. Everyone I know who ever read this book has loved it. The other two in the Old World trilogy, Dragonfly in Amber and Voyager, are also very well written and worth the time it takes to get through the 900 pages."
5,Excellent series!,"Up until about page 60 or so, I was wondering what the heck this book was about...well then the real story began. I don't think I was giving it my full attention until then as it was bookclub read so I was reading it like an assignment and not something I would've chosen to read. It is by far the best book I have ever read and I don't give this assessment lightly. This is a great book and once you read Outlander, you will either love it or leave it but I think most will become hooked on Outlander!"
1,Photoshop book masquerading as a digital photography book,"I really wanted this to be a good book, because it was a gift from my 12-year old son. Maybe next time...The title and cover of the book clearly state that it ""covers every aspect of digital photography."" That is simply not true. Of 160 pages, 100 are about what to do with preexisting digital images. Most of that focuses on using Photoshop, with a short section on printing. The other 60 pages are fluff ranging between explaining binary numbers and instructions on scanning film photos. I didn't find a single tip on how to take better digital photos.In a few months there will be a glut of good books on digital photography, to satisfy all those people who get digital cameras for Christmas. I recommend waiting for one of those books."
5,Great book,Anyone studying aging should buy this book. The school library had copy that I was using for research.....I wanted to make endless notes in it so I just got my own copy. You can't go wrong.
1,GIVE IT UP!,"PLEASE GIVE IT UP! YOU MY SCENE LOVERS ARE JUST BEING JEALOUS AND FULL OF ENVY(AND IF YOU MORONS DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS, LOOK IT UP!)OF SUCH BEAUTIFUL DOLLS.MY SCENE DOLLS COPIED OFF OF EVERYTING BRATZ. AND A LITTLE MESSAGE TO THE A&R GIRLS: SHUT UP IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE IDIOTIC JUNK TO SAY! PEACE OUT!"
1,EWWW,MY SCENE SUCKZ BIG TIME!! ITS SO UGLY AND THEY COPIED BRATZ. BRATZ ARE SOOOO MUCH BETTER THAN MY SCENE!! MY SCENE WISHES THAT THEY COULD BE AS CUTE AND PRETTY AS BRATZ BUT THEY CAN'T!! AND EWW LOOK AT THE SWAPPIN STYLES BARBIE!! SHE IS TERRIBLE! ESPECIALLY ONE OF HER SNAP ON HEADS WHERE SHE HAD TWO BIG PONYTAILS THAT STICK OUT ON BOTH SIDES OF HER HEAD!! THEY LOOK LIKE HORSE TAILS TO ME!!!
2,Uneven Sound Quality,"I concur with the previous reviewer that this disc has definite sound quality problems. It sounds like the person who mastered it fell asleep at the controls. That aside, there are several gems on this disc including versions of classics like ""The Jug of Punch,"" ""Brennon on the Moore"" and ""The Moonshiner."" On the down side, most of these songs lack the spark of their live recordings. I was unenthusiastic about several songs performed by family members other than the four original lads (the exception being the lovely ""I'll Tell My Mar"" by Peg and Bobby Clancy). Buyer beware: this collection is also sold under the title ""Home to Ireland - The Best of the Clancy Brothers & Tommy Makem."""
4,I love this Straightener,"I think this is the best straightener I have ever owned. It is a little harsh on your hair if you use it at the maximum setting (which I do) but it makes your hair perfectly straight with little effort and no time at all. I have long curly hair and I can do my entire head in less than 10 minutes. Longevity is a small problem the product lasts about a year and half with daily use, but I keep coming back to it. Every time mine has died (I've gone through 4 in the last 7 or so years) I buys another one. Considering the price and the productivity, I don't mind at all. I have tried others, including the Chi and this, in my mind, is the BEST."
3,a solid collection with some very strong stories,"I'm surprised how many really did NOT like his stories. It seems that after reading his novel, they wanted greater things from these early short stories. I found lots of promise in these short stories with much of the subtle style that he uses later in Snow Falling. The strongest stories in the collection involve young boys growing up in the Northwest. Although the action is lots of hunting and fishing, there is a major undercurrent of emotional tension and frustration. In some ways, these remind me of some of Hemingway's early stories, not so much in terms of style, but setting. The Hunters, for instance, brought back images of Hemingway's The Battler. If I could have given this collection 3 1/2 stars, I would have, but it's just short of 4. Still, I enjoyed almost every story in the collection. Guterson is a ""show"" not tell type of writer, so I suspect some readers weren't watching closely enough. There's beauty and depth in some of these stories."
5,I liked the book,"I dont know why you guys are being so harsh. I think that the book was a bit odd at times but very interesting. The family represented did seem to be a bit too similar, but thats what happens when an entire family is raised only by a military father, they all join the armed services. I also like how he showed how corrupt past presidencies were without using any names. On the whole I think this was a terrific book"
3,Haven't purchased yet because...,"I purchased the80.00 sub mentioned in a review of this item. I,as that gentleman was also very disappointed. It was useless.Obviously this must be an upgrade. It's twice the price and has a vent.My last Tivoli purchase was 10/07. I splurged on $800.00 table radio w/down firing sub. Sent it back; no bass.I'm on the fence. Best purchase was their sattelite W/ Sirius. All Tivolis I have get fantastic reception.WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO LIGHT THE DIAL. It's hard enoug to read in daylight.D.Fortes,M.V.MA3 stars because I haven't made the purchase...yet."
2,not a good subwoofer,"this subwoofer is weak, very weak. My computer subwoofer did a better job than this. When the bass was heavy, the subwoofer cannot handle the bass, the air blow out from the subwoofer make noise rather than giving a solid bass, abd it ruin everything."
2,"Good function, but fragile","Overall, I was pretty happy with my Yepp until, three months in, I dropped it from a few feet high (about waist high). Afterwards, no headphones could get sound out of it. Otherwise, until then, I was happy with the function of my Yepp."
4,"Good overview, but not impartial","Pojman does an excellent job of covering a lot of ground in this relatively short book. The writing is clear and easy to understand. However, I would not say that this book invites readers to discover their own ethical theories, as the back cover claims, because Pojman clearly discounts certain ethical theories and embraces others. Rather than discovering right and wrong on one's own, the reader instead is led down a path that discounts relativism and embraces objectivism and virtue ethics. Those aren't bad conclusions to reach, but the author should let the reader reach those conclusions instead of reaching them for him. It can be frustrating to read as Pojman declares a moral theory incorrect when, as the reader, one still sees merit in it."
5,Buy Bueno Entonces now!,"Bueno entonces helped this high school Spanish failure actually speak to natives and navigate South America! Affordable, user friendly, and INCREDIBLY CONVENIENT, I enjoyed the lessons and made good use of my spare time all from the convenience of my iPod. I HIGHLY recommend Bueno Entonces! [...]"
4,Effective and Entertaining,The program is easy to use. I am very weak at learning language. I almost failed Spanish and french in high school. So I am impressed that this program is engaging and I gain some very modest competency if I use it on a regular basis.The program has a major weakness which is there is no opportunity for the user to pronounce and therefore an important component of learning is absent. Also occasionally the humorous quipping becomes annoying.
2,Very Disappointed,My 6 year old son loves Avatar and we thought this would be a great toy. It turned out to be a big disappointment. Trying to place Aang in the top of Appa is so hard to do even for the adults. It does fly great but the frustration level trying to get it to launch is not worth it.
5,Beyond 5 Stars!!!,"This is easily a 5 Star Album... If you like great rock music with intelligent lyrics and a truly Canadian sound, Sam Roberts, and Chemical City is for you! This album plays through much smoother than 'We were born in a Flame' (still great!) Every song grew on me in only a matter of days. There is seriously something special about this album... I cant go any further, IT'S ALL GOOD!Get it, read the lyrics, and love every second of it!Bravo Sam Roberts Band!"
1,trouble shoot,book does not say anything about oil safety switch so wont be trouble shooted as the part thats bad and wont let engion have spark hence wont start. found this problem on my own before book arived. hense book wont be used.
3,Better than usual TAB trash but not substitute for factory m,"Tinkering with old Briggs engines is fun and I've saved dozens from the dump over the years. This book is better than some I have read, but it's no substitute for the factory manuals for a specific engine or engine series. It does have some information the factory books don't, such as ways to get around needing some of the tools-although Briggs tools are not terribly expensive and are readily available.This book is best used in addition rather than as a substitute for the factory data. Judging from other TAB titles, it could definitely been worse."
1,No vanguard information,This book has no information on the Japanese made Briggs and Stratton Vanguard engines. Not much good information in it.
1,Download censorship?,For some reason amazon will not sell you the complete mp3 version of Bonny black hare.
2,White Horses,"I was disappointed in this new release. Although the circus element was interesting and original, the heroine directed the hero of the book as if he were her pet. She told him when to come, what to say, what to wear even going so far as to take him shopping for clothing. The hero was on a leash with very little to say. There was little to no chemistry between the two which is very unusual for Joan's stories. The other characters in the book were uninteresting also. I do not recommend this book."
1,Pile of movie-clips and video drivel.,"This movie is like a big video; the acting is terrible; The plot worse than campy.It is a trouble sitting through it. The lines were are bad. Aguilera can't act. She cansing but that is not enough to save the movie. It is a horrible script, dialogue, andvery cliche storyline. But this movie would appeal to dumbdowned teenyboppers wholove Britney Spears series were worlds are just a pile of crap, like in this drivel."
5,Stress free Entertainment,"Regardless of what some critics have to say, I saw the movie to make my own opinion & I LOVED IT!! its a good mix of COYOTE UGLY, SHOWGIRLS & even CHICAGO, its Sexy, has a great looking star cast, good coreography, not bad songs, ever so lovable Cher & talented Christina.yes its not the most original story, but how many recent movies have really original stories ?! ..every movie is partly inspired by some old hit or even some foregin film.So just pack up your troubles, go get energised & enjoy this feel good movie.lets hope the Blu Ray has a lot of extra features & even the Original movie sountrack cd."
3,"Not bad enough to be ""fun bad"" not good enough to be great, but fun moments are there.","The most enjoyable parts of this movie are the lavish production numbers and Cam Gigandet being all sexy.It's all fluff, so if you like cotton candy, you'll probably enjoy this."
5,Moms favorite movie!,Great movie! Mom and I love musical type movies and this is amazing. I love the actors and actresses and the singing is awesome.
5,Critics are crazy... this movie is awesome!!!,"I am not sure why this movie got so many bad reviews from the critics. The storyline is sweet, the actors/actresses do an excellent job, Cher and Christina were amazing, and the routines were fabulous. A must have for your DVD collection."
5,burlesque,TThe movie was in excellent condition and was delivered as promised . I Easter very pleased either my purchase and would recommend to all my friends and family .
5,Loved Burlesque,"I loved this movie!!! I don't know why the critics blasted it. It's a pleasant upbeat story that doesn't take itself too seriously. I knew about Christina Aguilera but I wasn't really familiar with her singing other then her contribution to the soundtrack of Moulin Rouge (which I also love) were she sings Lady Marmalade with Pink, Mya, and Lil Kim and it is fabulous. I thought her acting was just fine but her dancing and singing in Burlesque was sensational. If you want to watch an entertaining movie with a happy ending then Burlesque is for you."
5,Movie,This was a great movie! The music was fantastic the acting was out of this world. It was so good I had to own the movie so when it came out on DVD I was there! Great job Christine and Cher!
1,"Disappointed, boot-legged copy, not complete","This stated the BURLESQUE DVD was NEW. It was a boot-legged copy and skipped entire CHAPTERS. I could NOT even see the end of the movie.Very disappointing, now I will have to go to BEST BUY and purchase a REAL new copy."
1,Worst Musical Ever,"This is the worst musical every. Cher is boring as usual. would have been better with a real star like Cathrine Zetah Jones. Xtina is just ok. if you want a real musical check out the classics like annie get your gun, gypsy, or mame."
3,Burlesque more like a retread!,"Ok so we have a formula.. think back a few years to Coyote Ugly, change the setting and voila!The acting is so-so, the songs are good and Cher..well she's just plain scary. At one stage I had to do a double-take as I thought she was wearing a Michael Myers hockey mask..but no..it was her face! Xtina has the voice, but it was a laugh when they ""changed"" from miming cd's to well..Xtina miming her songs lol.If you have a few hours to kill and a good surround with a decent sub crank it, if not I'd give it a pass.Also I found it funny that Xtina's own stage show outfits were raunchier than anything she wore in Burlesque and NO nudity to speak of.definition of Burlesque : Also, burlesk . a humorous and provocative stage show featuring slapstick humor, comic skits, bawdy songs, striptease acts, and a scantily clad female chorus (wish someone had read that when penning the script - more like hoochie koochie imho)."
5,Burlesque,The movie DVD arrived in a very short time period and was in perfect condition. There were no flaws in the dvd when I played it. The price was well below local retail store pricing.
5,What movie did the critics watch?,"What's up with all the flack this movie's been getting from critics? It's absolutely dazzling! This has to be one of the best musicals of the past decade. The musical numbers are phenomenal, the costumes are fabulous, and Christina is just marvelous. I've always known she was a great talent but I think this movie is just what she needed to showcase that talent. Her acting was good, her dancing was on point and what can I say about that voice? I'm not a fan of Cher but I really enjoyed her in this movie. Christina and her have great chemistry. The love story was also really cute. I'm salivating for this to come out on DVD/blu-ray so I can watch it over and over again!"
2,Not very good,The songs were good. The movie was terrible. It had a very predictable plot-line. It was almost like it was a rip off of coyote ugly. (which is a much MUCH better movie)
1,terrible,Why did I waste my money....what a drag of a movie. Watching paint dry would of been more exciting.Don't buy it.
5,Burlesque,"Standard story about a girl from a seedy area of the country with a great singing voice who moves to the big city and through hard work and persistance is able to display her ability to her boss who is about to lose her show business establishment, who takes the singer under her wing and together they are able to find success/eventual happiness for the singer and also save the boss's business. Very enjoyable musical numbers and very good acting on the part of Cher, Cam Gigandet and Stanley Tucci. Christine Aguilera is fairly good, though could use a couple more lessons to keep from overdoing it. In general....well worth the purchase and is one of those that can be watched again and again."
5,Pure Entertainment!,"My husband and I took our 16 year old granddaughter to see this movie. We all loved it! It was pure entertainment and so refreshingly unvulgar. We loved the singing and dance routines and didn't have to be embarrassed. I was worried that it would be vulgar and sexually explicit, something that we have too much of these days, and how wonderful to see that a movie can be done without that junk! The actors were very likeable and the story had a happy ending. I can't wait for the DVD so we can watch it again and again, just like Pretty Woman."
3,Corny stuff,"I wonder why in 2011 we're here to spend our eight bucks at movies and see a musical rooted in silent melodrama where Cher must save her failing nightclub from a villianous developer that wants to repossess it and tear it down. All he needed was a black top hat, cane, and mustache to put us back a century where we could watch Mary Pickford play Christina Aguilera's part. But those folks really had writers working on the word titles-- they could think of a more realistic love story than where Ali (Christina Aguilera) finally falls in love with Jack and after their night together, she can only say, ""I'm so glad you're not gay."" I also was turned off by the double standard. No put downs were delivered about women who might be gay. Cher and Christina were a love story waiting to happen themselves. Aguilera's acting has not matured any since she was in The New Mickey Mouse Club."
1,Burlesque,"Had a chance to catch up with this movie last night on ABC Family. I remember seeing the commercials when it was released in theaters and was excited about going to see it, but somehow, never got to get there. I'm glad I saw it on tv. While the musical numbers and Christina's voice were wonderful, the movie itself was not very good. The dialogue, awful. Love story, weak. I was impressed by Christina's talent and Cher looks good. What it did do for me is give me more confidence about my hope to be a screenwriter one day. Because if this movie could be made with such talented stars with the awful excuse for dialogue that was used, I should be successful. When I went to bed last night there was a part of me that did want to buy it for my collection, because I did like the musical numbers. But then the sane part of me reminded me that I just saw it for free on ABC Family, so it will be on again."
5,LOVE,"I LOVE this movie! And the Blue-ray/ DVD Combo is great! I have a blu-ray player in my living room for my big TV but only a regular DVD player in my Kitchen on my little TV. I really like that I can put the DVD on in my kitchen while I'm cooking and cleaning. Definitely would recommend people buy it. The movie has a good story line and if you like Christina Aguilera, I think you would like this movie."
5,I was pleasantly surprised,"A friend of mine really wanted to see this so, reluctantly, I went with... To my great surprise I really liked it - A Lot!!! I just got on the list to be alerted when it becomes available on Blu-Ray. The choreography and eye-candy is really outstanding. The music is really good too. Prior to this I was not a big fan of Christina Aguilera but now realize that she is truly a great singer. I also think that Cher is a great singer and actress, but personally don't like the sound of her voice so that would be my only disappointment with this movie. Still Cher does a great job and I enjoyed her perfomance nevertheless."
4,GREAT SINGING,"So the movie has a lousy predictable plot and lots of cliches, I love Cher and Christina and what they can do with a song! Loved the costumes and the musical numbers so well worth the price and something I can watch many times over."
2,Burlesque,LOVED THE SONGS . . . but the acting was horrendous! Great for a gals night of laughs . . .
2,I have 2 agree with nice dolls-SORRY I HAD A OPINION!!!!,"PUPPYGURL SAYS-YOU GUYS HAVE 2 STOP FIGHTING ABOUT DOLLS OK. SO WHAT IF BRATZ HAVE POP OFF FEET , THEY ARE EASIER 2 APPLY ON THEN BARBIE SHOES AND SO WHAT IF MYSCENE HAVE POP OFF HEADS, THEY DON'T DIE, THERE NOT ALIVE ,THERE PLASTIC!!!!! THEY HAVE POP HEADS BECAUSE U CAN SWITCH HAIRSTYLES. SO SHUT UP MYSCENE FANS AND SHUT UP BRATZ FANS TOO!!!!!!!!!!!! iF YOU R A MYSCENE AND BRATZ FAN LIKE ME, GOOD 4 U!!!!"
2,GET BRATZ DOLLS!,Stop buying these my scene dolls and buy bratz! They look better and are worth spending the money! Much love to the bratz fans out there but bratz are great for all ages. Bratz are the newest gereation dolls so stop buying barbies and my scenes and pick up a bratz doll!
5,It's just a doll!,What does it matter if the doll is a MyScene doll or a Bratz doll. They both have their pros and cons. The one thing I don't like about the Bratz dolls is that their feet come off and get lost to easy. I don't know how many times I had to dig through my daughter's toy box trying to find the Bratz's feet! She doesn't even play with the Bratz doll that she just had to have. My daughter is 6 years old and her favorite doll is any doll that's pretty. This doll seems very cool because it is like getting 3 dolls for the price of one. I plan on getting this doll for my daughter and I know that she will love it.
2,Brilliant music... bad recording,"The performances on this CD are absolutely phenomenal. The music has a raw authenticity that is sometimes missing in more polished recordings of Japanese music by groups like the Yamato Ensemble. Put simply, this is the kind of direct, unthinking [in the Zen sense] music that gets to the heart of Fuke Zen.Having said that, the sound quality on this CD is just this side of unlistenable. There is all kinds of sound and distortion and, in the higher registers, the tone of the flute is strangely compressed. If someone were to re-master this recording, it would be a masterpiece. As it is, it is, at times, barely listenable/"
1,Very Disappointed.,"I was expecting to hear some authentic Swiss mountain music (ok, and German & Austrian)- not Texas cowboy music. The first 10 songs are in English and are annoying to listen to.No.11 is ""I am a Yodeling Girl"", sung by a man. The rest are in German, Swiss-German, etc, though many sounded like they were sung by Americans learning a second language. A couple were decent performances of some good yodeling, but generally the rest were disappointing. I want my eight bucks back."
2,Alpine yodels,"This CD was not as described. I asked for a CD with yodeling by Ruedi Rymann, and his name was displayed on the page with this CD, as was his most famous song, Dr Schacher Seppli, so I assumed they would be on the CD. Not so, and the first half of the Cd was in english with western yodeling and background slide guitar. So I enjoyed what I bought, but it was not what I expected. I would suggest that Rymann's name not be associated with this CD."
1,Alert,"Kingdom Hospital The Beginning, Kingdom Hospital Making The Rounds, and Kingdom Hospital Post Mordem are all included on Kingdom Hospital Entire Series. Your better off and cheaper in the end buying the Entire Series and not the individual DVD's."
4,Great Book to Own,"I got this as a textbook for a geography class a few years ago. I was really surprised at how much I actually got from the class and I attribute it all to this book. It's not just about memorizing the locations of countries and cities, this book goes into detail about how and why borders are where they are. That sounds daunting, but it's very straight forward and concise and really puts it all into perspective.I keep this on my shelf of books in my living room because I need it at hand for history classes. I come back to it again and again.I sorta wish it had more full page maps."
5,Best lotion I've ever used,"Everyone in my family has always had really dry skin. We have tried everything. It was Eucerin for a long time, but that was expensive and oily and didn't even work that well. Nivea and Vaseline Intensive Care never worked well. The only thing that ever really worked well was Vaseline Petroleum Jelly, but that's sort of gross.Fruit of the Earth Cocoa Butter plus Aloe & Vitamin E lotion is by far the best lotion I've ever used. Since it's been hard to find on shelves, I've been ordering it in larger quantities to make sure I have a supply just in case it becomes unavailable.If you have really dry skin, you have to try this!"
4,Feng Shui and Money,"Found the book helpful but my house is not in order of the Tai Chi, still working on it with a sister who is doing the same. Good help and advice in everyday life."
2,"Good Read, Bad Resolutions","I know this books is supposed to be about how the world is complicated and nothing is simple when you are in love, but when none of the plot lines are resolved it makes the book a waste of time. I get that it wants to be about a boy learning to be more complicated, but when that comes with glimpses of a much better novel with actual plots it all falls apart. I would say that the author is very good at writing, and the world he creates you can become immersed in. I just wish he would have developed the story instead of basically dropping hints about what could have happened, but never explaining what really did."
3,Insightful,"This is a thought provoking and insightful book, even if at times it displays a somewhat heavy prose. If find it odd, though, that the author doesn't mention the ""congnitive dissonance theory"" which (to my eyes at least) seems to overlap with parts of his arguments and examples."
2,TTFs continue their decline,"I have about 17 Tunnel Trance force albums and this is one of the worst. His series is going the way of the old Ministry of Sound series. Instead of putting a 2 disc CD out every month DJ Dean should put out quality discs like he used to back in 01-02. I go back and listen to 9, 12-13, 20,24 and get pumped back up on the hard-hitting, head-bobbing trance that he made his name on. This 2 CD set has about 7 good songs on it. The second half of the second CD is pretty good, but based on the amount of money these CDs cost and on the quality of Dean's earlier CDs, I have to rank this as a 2 star buy. I'd recommend any TTF 24 and earlier. They are all pretty good. 12 and 13 are both pretty good. I always liked 6 the Cyber mix. And 24 is probably his best of the later mixes.Just tryin to keep you all informed."
4,Good gift,This is a good gift for parents or anyone you love. Liked it very much. Did not have any problems with its functioning whatsoever and works as described.
1,sorry folks,"I WENT TO MY PHYSICIAN LAST WEEK ON FRIDAY 08/29 AND I COMPARED MY PRODUCT TO THE DOCTORS BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR AND THE READINGS WERE TOTALLY DIFFERENT.MY DOCTOR RECOMMENDED I NOT USE THIS PRODUCT AT ALL AS A DAILY BAROMETER IN READING AND LOGGING MY BLOOD PRESSURE READINGS QUITE A DISAPPOINTMENT TO SAY THE LEAST I FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND ALWAYS THE SAME RESULTS I JUST WISH I HAD BP READINGS AS GOOD AS THE ONES I GET FROM THIS PRODUCT. TOO LATE TO SEND IT BACK SO I,M STUCK WITH IT NOT RECOMMENDED"
2,Too tempermental,"I purchased this product after reading numerous reviews on it and I must say I was not impressed with my purchase. I use it for work in a rehab facility and if the patient isn't completely still it reads error! I know that they aren't always the most accurate, no matter the brand, but some of the readings are way off. I purchased it to save time and hassle of finding the proper cuff size, but It seems to be more of a hassle than a help. I would not recommend this product ... sad:("
5,Worth the money!,Very good item. Gives accurate reading. I took it to my doctor and compared the values with what my doctor took. Fast and easy to operate. I follow all the instruction to get reading and it always gives me right reading!
5,Make mine Morgan,"I really enjoyed last year's Death is a Cabaret by Morgan. This sceond book in the series was worth the wait. The pacing of the story is wonderful, and again, I love the antique information in the book. Deborah Morgan's characters are like people I actually know, and it makes it that much more fun to read.In this book, Jeff Talbot is off for a fishing weekend. And as often happens in mysteries, someone is found dead. Jeff's involvement makes sense and doesn't feel forced, like a lot of amatuer slueth books do. The ending is also wonderful.I look forward to many more books in this series."
5,Perfect graduation gift for dancers,I have found this book to be a perfect graduation gift for my graduating seniors. Having the music CD with it is a bonus. It's something they will keep forever.
5,"Song of the year, Book of a lifetime!!","I love this song and was so excited when I found it in book form. The words are such an inspiration. I have my own copy and have bought several others. It was a gift for my Mom for her 60th birthday because I believe you are never too old to dance, or to live life."
1,"Problem with Map of Florence, Italy","On our recent trip to Italy, we found the map for Rome was fine, with good details. However, the map for Florence was not helpful at all. Only a very few streets were available. On the other hand, my son-in-law had loaded his Garmin with the maps of Europe and his version of the map of Florence was very well detailed. (During the trip to Florence, when I realized the map was of no use, I attempted to contact the seller via email to see if I could download another version...but got no response.)"
3,Not What I'd hoped for!,"I'm not sure how this chip would work for driving, but I purchased it to help us navigate around Rome, Venice and Athens for our recent trip. It proved pretty much useless. It took way too long to recognize where it was, particularly when we changed locations, but even when it had just been off for a while in the same city. I ended up using my iPhone and Google Maps, which worked much better, although that service also leaves something to be desired as far as orienting you to where you are. Anyway, we had a great trip, mostly by asking for directions at our hotels and occasionally on the streets. Since I don't regularly travel to Europe, purchasing the chip to help us get around was pretty much a waste of $80."
1,Item was defective and did not work.,"When in Italy, I tried to use the Garmin Card which I purchased for my trip to Italy. The item did not work. It recognized one address and then just kept giving me the notice of ""item not found"". I had to return to the car rental office and rent a garmin from them. The card was totally useless."
1,Caution,Got me lost on the first day which was only an hour no big deal but when the map of florence was whited out that was a big problem because we wanted to spend a couple of days touring had to buy maps and figure out where to go . Why have this card waste of money
1,Garmin City Navigator - Maps,"This product was unworkerable on my Garmin GPS, Amazon was contacted and they sent me a mailing label and the product was returned to Amazon. A replacement Garmin City Navigator was ordered and it was received and it worked just fine, but my Visa card has been charged for both units. I would like my Visa card credited for the first unit that I returned."
2,Italy GPS Card limitations,"Garmin City Navigator for Detailed Maps of Italy and Greece (microSD/SD Card)I discovered that the map of Florence, Italy was not included in this software. I was not able to use this GPS to navigate around Florence, Italy, which was very frustrating and disappointing. I could not plug in any addresses in Florence that did in fact exist.The software did work for other cities and towns which I was grateful. My complaint is with Garmin Company."
4,Everlast Speed Bag Swivel,I've been using this swivel daily for about a month. I've switched out bags many times between large and small without effort or compromise in function. The one thing that I have done is spray a bit of WD40 to quiet it up which helped a lot. Overall very happy with this product.
5,Happily Surprised,"This is the first time I have ordered jewelry from Amazon and really didn't know what to expect. I was plesantly surprised , this necklace is of good quality for the price. It looks great with any shade of blue from sweaters to blue jeans . I'd recommend it!"
5,Classic Horror Ghost Story Gets Outstanding DVD Release,"This excellent shocker outdoes the recent remake by a long shot. Ulli Lommel's film of THE BOOGEYMAN was criticized in 1980 for its violence and strong horror. Now that Hollywood horror movies have caught up to the intensity and ""fear factor"" of this movie, Lommel's film seems very contemporary. One of the giveaways that this is a 1980s horror film is the droning synthesizer music. Don't let that stop you from watching this one. Plus Sony's remastered presentation is a huge improvement over the earlier DVD release from Anchor Bay.Willy and Lacey murder their mother's abusive lover. The man's soul haunts a mirror that unleashes a terrible revenge on Lacey and Willy as grown-ups. Suspense doesn't let up and even the quiet scenes have a sense of forboding and terror. WORTHWHILE."
5,"Fine, fine essays on Joyce","Well-written essays, concise, and enlightening. Some of Kenner's points blew my mind--and I've been reading Joyce for 20 years (already). Definitely worth a shot."
2,J.A.Henkels 7-Inch Hollow Edge Santoku,"Nice shape knife, good handle.... but unexpected rust a small tip on knife within a week - very disappointed. Needed some special rust remover."
2,Inaccurate description - hollow edge only on one side!,"Considering the high expectations I had from this knife, I feel completely let down. Nowhere does it say the hollow edge is only on one side, and that too the side appropriate for left handers. This is the same side that is visible in the packaging and the other side is flat - a fact that does not leave a very good impression of the company. Don't buy unless you are left handed. Otherwise, the knife is sharp, and thus the 2 star rating."
4,Good value,"Henckels International means these knifes are made in China with German steel, known to be of high quality and high price, especially for forged ones. However, this knife is almost at the same level as those entirely made in Germany. Santokus can perform all kinds of tasks and are a Japanese type now very popular. This model has a nice modern ergonomic handle and stays sharp for a long time. Very good value: unexpensive but efficient. Heavy as I like, heavy as expected for a forged knife. Not very flexible as Santokus true to Japanese style but I do not consider this a drawback."
4,Good,"I love these pills, and take them to help improve my skin. Over time, they have started to smell a little fishy, but at least they do not taste that way. If taken with a meal, there is no fishy after-taste."
1,I read many books on arctic and antarctic exploration,"and hands down, this book is the worst. To put it bluntly, it is a piece of garbage. To intermingle myth with history without a thread of fact, to question every piece of evidence on its own without fitting the pieces of the puzzle together, and to even suggest a conspiracy can survive and let alone be passed down from generation to generation, is nuts. Was there incompetence in the Franklin saga? Definitely. But to suggest a coverup to an event that could not possibly have anything at all to hide, was just a waste of my time. I kept waiting for the punchline, but the book was like a joke that just was not funny. My most painful experience with this book is that I picked it up to take overseas with me, and it was the only English languaged reading material that I had. Never take just one book with you on a trip."
5,I'm an Irish man and this shows our proud heritage!,I love the songs on this album and this will help me learn how the music effected the people of Ireland and helps with my report and teaches me about my proud heritage...
3,somewhat satisfied,"i purchased this set on 07-27-06 as a gift for a friend...for the most part i am satisfied,not the best(or worst).would not purchase for myself...really nice set for the price...the straight blades slice through the toughest meat like butter."
2,Save Your Money,"My little girl who is 5 LOVES Spirit, Rain, and everything about the movie and characters. She was very disappointed with this game and so was I. It literally takes HOURS to beat this game. No 5 yr. old I know can sit at a computer for 3+ hours. It is too difficult to control a horse using a mouse, and Rain is sooo demanding. You have to take care of her the entire game until she is well, then you get to go on all of the other adventures. You play as Spirit, and you have to constantly stop the necessary tasks to rescue the other members of the herd to go and tend to Rain. It was really a huge disappointment. Loading time stinks, too. SAVE YOUR MONEY! Even if your child is a huge fan of this movie, they probably will not like this game just because it is very poor."
3,Not for the younger child,"My 4 yr old daughter loves Spirit and anything to do with horses. We bought this game early 2003 and was very frustrated how hard it is to play for a young child. This game is for the 8+ range defenitly. I had to play it while my daughter watched and I finished the game and now she can roam around Spirit's homeland free. If you are looking for a game for the avid younger (toddler) horse lover, I suggest Barbie Horse Adventures. My daughter would rather play that than the Spirit game. It is a good game to play and it is quite fun....however, for a much older child."
4,Short & Sweet!,I am a busy mom & have a tough time fitting in exercise in my daily routine. I like this DVD because you can mix & match various segments according to your preference.I especially like the 20min cardio interval training. It gets my heart rate up & I feel good after competing it. The abs & strength segments are ok too.A good edition to your workout library.
4,Mainstream rap with a meaning?!?!,"You're kidding me right? Kanye West has successfully pulled off what underground rappers have been doing for years: put a meaning in his songs. Who knew you could write a club banger about Jesus, and that's exactly what Kanye's done here. ""Jesus Walks"" is a catchy song with multiple videos, all of them controversial, and now he's earned the title of ""best of the worst"", worst being mainstream rappers. If you're a fan of ""Jesus Walks"", you can't really go wrong with this single, it features a live version of ""Through the Wire"", and even the Jesus Walks remix, appropriately featuring Mase."
3,Amazon Ad Incorrect,This ad must be wrong it says 192oz and 12oz per package. That equals 16 bags in the case but Vitaspelt's web page shows the product packed 6 bags per case not 16. But at checkout it says 6 bags.
5,Insightful,"As Christian and a director, I am always looking for God in the works I direct. While working on THE MERCHANT OF VENICE, I came upon this work by Morrison and found scholarship, enlightenment and great wisdom in it. His analysis of the various issues of sin and temptation, fidelity and love and other major issues in some of Shakespeare's great plays and characters gave me a fresh perspective on my study of this play and Shakespeare's genius. ~ ST Lemos"
4,If you take a class...,"That uses this as it's text, be worried. The book is decent, but definitely just ""concepts,"" no intensive knowledge is conveyed in it's pages. Oh well."
4,Fairly good delivery time,I bought a used book that is still in good shape. The delivery time was also fair.
2,Somewhat interesting but flawed,"This book offers coverage of issues encountered in designing an operating system, but does this in a rather dry and uninteresting manner, using examples and diagrams which are somewhat contrived and confusing at times.Its code snippets are often incorrect and shows no sign it has ever been checked for correctness. I am basing this assumption on the fact this is the 7th edition and blatant errors still exists. Errors range from syntax to logic errors, both in the explanations and code provided.The book also does not explain certain algorithms, and merely prints them in pseudo code, then moves on with not insights into the how and why of it.If you have no other choice, then this book will suffice as long as you take what it says with a grain of salt, and apply your own logic rather than take what the authors say as gospel.Cheers,Steve"
1,Poor warranty coverage - damaged product,"I received the Audiovox VE-640 as a Christmas gift, but my kitchen was being remodeled, so I was just able to get it installed. The antenna jack on the back of the unit was defective/damaged and the piece broke off when the cable company tried to screw in the cable line. Audiovox only provides a 90 day warranty on the product, which seems ridiculously short, and refuses to stand behind their product even when the unit is defective. It's going to cost me about $100 to repair it, plus the cost for the cable guy. I'm not a fan of Audiovox anymore and don't recommend their products."
4,Inside the remaining Jackson Five,"There are two discs, full of information about the remaining brothers of the Jackson Five and their own families. For those who are interested in this family, you will find ""eyes on"" updating of who they are today and what they are trying to do. The story line is about a concert that the four brothers are trying to put together, and reveals their personalities and how they mesh or refuse to mesh together as they attempt something they had not done in years, and that is to work together in preparation for a concert. As children, they did as they were told without a lot of push-back. However maturity and adulthood has taken its toll on their ability to give and take in concert preparation. This information fills in many gaps that former utterances by Michael left unexplained. for hard-core Jackson Five fans, this video is ""must"" waching."
1,KEEP YOUR MONEY!!,"I saw this c*** on Youtube. BORING! The only interesting part of this show was when the 911 call was added, and they showed MJ'S funeral (part of it, the one at Forest Lawn, held in September '09) You still can not see anything after MJ'S casket is removed from the hearse though.I only PRAY that you have not pre-ordered this mess yet. If so, send it back as soon as you get it..PLEASE! Do not let the makers of this silly show rip you off!Thank You."
2,"Flat, boring, unoriginal","Very narrow narration..never goes beyond the characters and their DRUG problems..Trainspotting was about so much more than the drugs.. Characters are pretty unmemorable too, nothing special about them."
3,It was ok......,"This book was pretty realistic, nothing exaggerated. It was a raw picture of what addiction is like. But I just didn't enjoy the book's style, and that could be a personal problem, but the book kind of got boring after a while. I ended up renting the movie and not finishing the book."
4,Love it!,This is great for the little ones who love to dress up. My son goes from pirates to doctors and now to superman and this was a great bonus. It is easy enough for him to put on and I don't mind him wearing it out in public :) The sounds are another great effect for this cape. So far it it is handling up great to my 4 year old.
2,Thicker than advertised,"Ad says it was 3"" high. Closer to six. Fear I might fall and rupture myself on my many nightly jaunts to potty. Would like Amazon to spend more time on getting the before sale information correct and quit pestering me for ""feedback"" I know the marketers are in charge and they discuss me."
2,Helpful but very uncomfortable,"While this product is helpful for my mother to get up off of the toilet, it is very uncomfortable."
4,Keep Reading,This is a mystery of a gay cop names Kimo in HI. I loved the character of Kimo. He is very well written. The story unfolds before you and you never where it will turn next.The only complaint I had it was very slow to pick up but after the first couple of chapters it went and never stopped. I say read it and give it a chance to grab you because when it does you will not put it down.The writer is great and I look forward to the next Kimo Mystery.
2,Good thing there's a dance mix...,"Hope the girls didn't plan to go out with a bang by releasing as their last single another mess of a boring sappy slow jam. Too many of this type of song is definitely what weakened all their albums--great upbeat songs interrupted by terrible ballads. On this single, after 3 horrible four minute slow mixes, you finally get a very strong house mix with a harder edge. But unfortunately, it's only about 4 minutes long! This is an edit of the full 7 minute version, which I would have prefered over yet another remix of Girl, by the master of boring disco house, Maurice Joshua."
4,Clifford,I thought it was a good book. I likedthe part when Cliffordtried to played volleyball and forgot about the net. That was avery cute part. I felt sorry for him because he tried to fit inand be a part of it. The ending was cute because he got to beapart of it. Norman Bridwell did a good job with it I would saythat this is a cery good book to read.
3,It has it's positives,"The methods used in this book are pretty good for a jump-start to learning basic Spanish. Example: The book suggest when conjugating verbs to use the imperfectform instead of the preterite form (for past tense) because there are fewer conjugations in that form and far less irregularities. The grammar's not right but you'll be understood.The problem I have with the book is how it stereotypes construction workers as if they are all a bunch of neanderthals. I do sports that involve mixing with people of a lot of different professions and (with few exceptions) without some kind of hint like a uniform, suit or expensive car, you would not be able to guess the type of work that people do, be it attorney, policeman or laborer.RDW"
3,Not bad but needs work,"This book was pretty good. It's the first time I read a book from her, but the end kind of just stops. It's like she had to stop the story right there and couldn't elaborate on the ending, which was pretty disappointing. But besides that it was good."
1,If this is authentic Belly Dance music....,"then I am an authentic blonde. It IS Slavic/Eastern European folk music in the style of Esma Respenova (could even be her). But it is NOT suitable for Belly Dance. It doesn't even have remotely suitable rhythms or musical patterns. The sad thing is, this set keeps reappearing every so often, like an Elvis siting, to snooker some poor beginning student (who could only be discouraged in trying to dance to this! ) I recommend checking out any of the Hossam Ramsy and the like for what is real and authentic in the world of Middle Eastern Dance. This CD is clearly a case of false advertising and intentional mis-representation to fool the uninformed."
1,Absolutely horrid,"Not only is the music bad, but the album is mislabelled. Several unfortunate women taking my introductory dance class purchased this album, since it was the only ""belly dance"" album available in local stores. The cover art is different from that pictured above, and showed a middle eastern dancer. I can understand why they bought it. Once upon a time, it snookered me in, too, but I promptly took the CD back for a refund. Production values are terrible, and the music, as if not bad enough already, has numerous dropouts and tape hiss. When I explained the technical problems with the music shop manager, he said he'd never order anything from that label again. Apparently all their ""ethnic"" music had the same shoddy production values, and same shoddy ""music."" Caveat emptor!"
1,Buyer beware!,"Despite the title, this is NOT an album of music suitable for belly dance. The music is eastern european in its sound and not middle eastern. This album has been floating around in one form or another, under different titles, for years, but refuses to die. Authentic Belly Dance Music? So much for truth in advertising!"
2,Disappointing,"The second time I put the product in boiling water, which you have to do to recharge it, it split open, rendering it useless!"
2,It's okay,"This is a great concept..reusable..earth friendly, but it only lasts less than 30 minutes. I would be inclined to use it for short outings, but otherwise, the hot hands last alot longer and are alot warmer than this."
3,Okay book,"This was not my favorite of this series. The plot was pretty predictable to me. I like the author's writing style though, so this made it enjoyable. If you are a huge fan of historical fiction, you will probably enjoy this book."
2,Why is it not compatible with macs?!,"I bought this ipod after ruining another one by letting it fall, so this time i took care of it, bought a $40 apple case for it and never even left it in the car because i was afraid of the heat screwing it up. The thing is, every once in a while when i connected it to my computer (i own a G4 mac with OSX) it would get jammed and i forcefully had to remove it without ejecting it first; as the months passed, it started getting frozen while i was listening music. Now it's dead and apple says the hard drive is damaged and i might as well buy another one. Hell, I am never buying an ipod again. I guess not everyone gets the mp3 player ipod dream of the commercials. Apple: You suck! Start making compatible devices with your own hardware!"
4,An excellent book for teenagers everywhere,"As a student I think Breaking Rank really got the attention of the reader. It relates to high school at a very real level. The way that ""the Cribs"" have there stereotypical idea of all the Clan members is very true in high school, maybe not that a group of people is exactly like the clan but most people stereotype groups of people before they get to met them and breaking rank shows that very well. The only thing I would have to disagree with about the book is the language the characters us. Teens tat are in high school us a lot more vulgar language than ""darn."" Other than that I think every English class should read this book."
2,Barron's ought to be ashamed,"It looks as though the book I have recieved is a set of photocopies of photocopies of photocopies made over the 20 or so years since this course was developed. The tapes, likewise, seem to be copies of copies of copies.The material seems to be sound, though...from what I can make out."
4,A Generous Helping,"This CD is copiled from several old Clancy LPs, all of which were worth having. Pleasant, straightforward presentation of a wide variety of tunes, some well-known, but many obscure and a real treat to discover. Even amid the recent flood of Irish traditional singing, Makem's voice still excells most of them, and he is at his best on some of these songs. A pretty decent pile of songs for your money, as well."
2,Not worth the money,"Chapter 1 is a nice introduction to probability. Chapter 2 is readable. Chapter 3 is poorly presented, and you feel sad for having wasted so much money on a book with only one intelligible chapter."
4,Good buy!,I am very pleased with the quality of the universal travel wireless PDA keyboard since it was cheap!
2,7 week cycling for fitness,If you know nothing about cycling its good. But if you have spent a whisker of time in the saddle its a little boring.
2,Almost useless,"This is a soft fabric case which offers little or no protection to the Xpress device. I gave it two stars because it does protect against scratches. It will not, however, protect against dropping or crushing. I expected a hard shell, padded case. Instead I got cloth. A Crown-Royal bag would do just as well."
4,Lots of melodrama but a refreshing way to view dinosaurs,As another reviewer said there is a TON of speculation here. It's merely a what if? of dinosaur fights. It's a bit WWE style with alot of drama and the outcomes predetermined by one mans opinion but in the end it is a refreshing and 21st century way to study and learn about dinosaurs. They bring up alot of unusual breeds of dinosaurs the average person has never of. There are alot of interesting situational battles based on the food and water supply which make it fun. Overall its definitely worth a watch if you are a casual dinosaur fan.
2,what's the hype about?,"I seriously got next to nothing out of this book. I did realize that we are already an intentional family, which is why i gave this book 2 stars instead of one. If you don't do family meals, have the tv blaring all day long, and never spend time talking with your spouse, then you might enjoy this book. If not, don't waste the time."
1,Three hard disk failures-definitely buy the extended warranty,"I love the Ipod when it works, but I have had three die on me out of the blue. I have taken care of all of them. They have not been dropped or exposed to high or low temperatures. It's easy to get them replaced if you pay extra for Applecare. That's definitely worth it. If you have not already invested in getting your music onto Itunes, look closedly at other MP3 players before getting locked into Ipod. At this point, I have 6000 songs rated on Itunes. It would take too much time to switch."
3,It's ok,"The best thing: it fit my entire CD collection. The worst thing, the sound is par with FM radio quality on all my songs despite recording them at very high bit rates. I expected the sound to be at least par with the mp3 player on my cellphone. Also, the album art feature only works if you use itunes to download your CD's to your computer. I used Windows Media Player to download over 5000 songs of my entire CD collection prior to purchasing my ipod. Unless I delete them all and reload them (1 weeks work) the album art feature is useless. Customer support offers no alternatives.11/10/2006 Addendum- I have to downgrade this review to 1 star. 3 months after purchase, the hard drive failed and the unit had to be replaced, thankfully it was still under warranty. Today it failed again, still with rare but normal use, and naturally it is out of its pathetic 6 month warranty. I Never have reached full satisfaction with the device throughout the months. Waste of money. Over-hyped."
1,This did not work,I plugged in the ipod for charging immediately upon recieving it. However after almost 8 hours there was no charge still. I tried a multitude of ways from my computer to my wifes computer to outlet plug ins. None of these worked. It kept showing that i needed to plug it in to an outlet. I tried the 5Rs and still not working. I returned this product and went with a Zune instead. This is why i've never liked freaking iAnything
2,"Cute, but does not protect from heat!","I've had this for several months. It's definitely cute and works okay if you're only holding the hot pot/pan for a second or two. Any longer, though, and the heat comes right through to burn your fingertips. This is more a novelty item than a functional kitchen tool."
3,You have to like and appreciate bullfighting.,"Barnaby Conrad is great at introducing the art of bullfighting to a public who knows nothing about it. That you will get to love it - maybe not. But, my mother was Spanish and I lived in Spain for many years and I love and appreciate bullfighting so to get the real flavor of it - read Hemmingway's ""The Dangerous Summer"" or ""Death in the Afternoon."""
1,Bad Speaker,"I coudn't stand this video. From the get go he stutters, pauses, ""ah""s and ""um""s continuously. The text is not scripted, nor is it conversational. I think he had stage fright in front of the camera. He needs to learn how to speak. As a result, I could not listen any more, and certainly nothing useful was absorbed of the footage I did watch. The intro cut scenes, every 1 - 2 seconds, made no sense and was unnerving. Although there was some good camera footage here and there, it was edited poorly. He may be a god sailor, but he is certainly a lousy narrator."
2,Half-Hearted,"Though Veirs doesn't match up to her closest female contemporaries Nina Nastasia and Chan Marshall, she has a light, clear delivery and slightly left of center arrangements which lovers of singer-songwriters are likely to enjoy. Her failing comes in words, naive, just shy of pretentious, a sort of coffee-shop intellectualism that leaves the songs feeling stale and without weight. Veirs can't quite seem to decide between genres, but rather than integrating the different styles she explores, country, artsy-folk, indie-pop, etc., she approximates each to the effect that one hears her as a bundle of influences rather than a force of influence herself. There is room for Laura Veirs, though not perhaps amidst the artists she seems keen on emulating."
3,It was okay,"I remember when I first read this book I though it was really good even though some things i didnt agree with. I recently re-read it and i really don't like the book as much. I thought it was poorly written for the most part because (Moore)had to explain a lot of the things she wrote and that hurt the book immensely. I also disliked the fact that she used, Dannng, and shoot so much not because of the words per se, but because Sometimes they seemed overused and out of place. Like it didn't flow naturally. Some of the insight payton(main Character) had gotten, as well as the story line, was very good. I especially liked when she met Tad taylor and saw what it was like to have a real man that genuinely loved god. Tad reminded me of a lot of the guys at my church who focus on God and it was nice to see. All in all it was an okay book I wouldn't buy it but it's a good book to read."
1,Not worth it.,"My JD tractor sprinkler lasted approximatley 40 feet during its first use, when the gears stripped on level ground with a lightweight half-inch hose. It still works as a non-traveling sprinkler, but the sound of the gears slipping (as it attempts to move) is rather annoying."
5,An alternative to an expensive sprinkler system,Works great! Waters my entire backyard just as well as having an expensive sprinkler system. Good quality as John Deere has always been known to produce. One minor glitch which I encountered is that I use two 50' hoses and on some occasions the sprinkler jumps off track at the point where the two hoses are coupled but this has only been a very minor inconvenience.
4,Not Heavy Enough,"Have only used the sprinkler one time. Found it to be slower, even in HIGH gear, than my previous sprinkler but that is probably O.K. because it will deliver more water.This sprinkler is not as heavy as my previous sprinkler and will not pull nearly as much hose even though I am using very light weight hose. Had to pull hose ahead more often than with old sprinkler. If it were operating on soft ground it would probably dig itself down to axles rather than pull a lot of hose.Seems to be well constructed and it is name manufacturer so when parts are eventually needed they should be avaible."
2,Effective but fragile and wandering.,"The tractor sprinklers, in general, are a great way to water a large lawn without having to move sprinklers around every half hour. The Gilmour John Deere Traveling Sprinkler, however, is prone to breakage and tends to wander off track.. The main body is metal, but other important parts are cheap plastic. The auto shut-off plunger on the underside was the first part to break, and one of the nozzle arms broke when the tractor flipped over. This product requires close monitoring because it tends to derail from its hose ""track"" and wander off on its own.I recommend a similar product by a different company."
2,a little weak,"After only two uses (1 hour each), one of the nozzles at the end of the arm came off and went someplace in the yard. Since this travels, finding it was impossible. I had to return the unit because nobody would respond to a request for parts."
2,Gear box is not good,"I purchased a John Deere Traveling Sprinkler in September. The unit's gear box failed in less than 2 months. I contacted the manufactuer and they replaced the entire unit. I started using the new unit in April of the next year and it failed within two to three months. I called the manufactuer of the product and they replaced both the gear box and wheels. I replaced the components and they failed again again before the summer was over. I purchased a new gear box the next season and of course it failed in less than 3 months.Basically the most time I have had this unit work is about 2.5 months at any one time. When I complained for the third or fourth time to the customer service group, they admitted the product was having a problem with the gear box and maybe with the wheels. The gears are plastic. The simply will not last. The gears should be upgraed to metal. I am very disappointed with this product and would not recommend it."
3,Not for all,A well written and illustrated guide to the 165 or so plants that grow well in the author's portion of California. The book must be faulted for not including plants that grow well and provide color in the arid and desert regions of the state. Certainly water wise gardening should be included. No mention is made of the use of California native plants in the garden. A beginning gardener will be better served by Sunset's WESTERN GARDEN BOOK. Those who will admit to living in an arid region (this includes Los Angeles) will find Eric Johnson's JOHNSON'S GUIDE TO GARDENING: PLANTS FOR THE ARID WEST of great value for its coverage of native plants. Desert gardeners will need the Coachella Valley Water District's LUSH & EFFICIENT: GARDENING IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY as their guide to effective desert gardening.
1,Save Your Money!,"I rented this set and CBS, as others have said, ruined the perfect opportunity to release this classic show to disc. So since they decided that buying the rights to some tunes is too much of an investment, they released the majority of the episodes with their own music. WOW! Just think. A Super Bowl 30 second commercial can rake in millions yet these guys cry this would break their bank. I'll pass on buying. Chiller, Sci-Fi, here I come with my DVD recorder."
3,Darkside (complete series) okay but overrated,"Lets be honest, the best episode of the entire series was Savini directed ""In The Closet"". It came the closest to what this series strived to be, a successor to the original ""Twilight Zone"" and ""Night Gallery"". Unfortunately, this series suffered from the same problem of most eighties horror - too much humor and not enough chills. I'm a avid fan of seventies Romero films but this falls flat (as does most of George's output) when compared to those classics, even stuff like ""Season of the Witch"". I could barely sit through Season Two which was downright silly for the most part. I suppose in comparison to other SF/Horror series of the time period this might be considered a welcome alternative but I fail to see its classic status."
1,Thanks for the Heads Up...I cancelled my order.,"...for those who mentioned that the musical soundtracks had been removed in parts and replaced with alternate cues.... Thanks for saving me the time and money. I just cancelled my order. I used to love this show. The show had many good moments. How sad. But what can you expect....it's good thing that Paramount sold the rights to Hitchcock's Psycho years ago. If not, we might have been subjected to a special DVD release of the Hitchcock Classic with Herrmann's score replaced by Yanni. Nothing against Yanni...but material should be released as close to originally aired as possible. Does Paramount really think that fans would stand for this?"
3,Excellent show hampered by a substandard release,"I really love this show.Like a lot of people, I am upset and angry that the score has been replaced. I can accept that the release isn't given anything in the way of restoration but I think it's really poor that fans aren't given the show that they remember. I think it's particularly important with cult media that content providers are careful to cater to the interests of fans.To the show. Like any anthology, it's a mixed bag of the great and not-so-great. My favourite episode is 'Slippage' starring David Patrick Kelly. It's quite reminiscent of The Twilight Zone.I find this to be an enjoyable series. This is not simple nostalgia on my part. I don't believe I saw it when it was originally broadcast but picked up some ex-rental VHS tapes about 7 years ago because I was curious. I'm glad I did and am practically begging for the other three seasons to make it to DVD release."
5,This is one of the Best!!!,"It is about time they have come out with these on dvd, however I get so mad when they drag out each seasons release. Knowing our luck Season one will be out in February, but season 2 will not be available until six months later and so on. Lets just hope these are available back to back!!!! I am ready to buy them up."
5,Not My Little Granddarlings!,"As Audrey Ricker says, admitting they aren't perfect is the first step to curing rudeness in your grandchildren. As I began the book, I thought, she doesn't know my perfect little darlings. If they're a little sassy, it's just a phase. They'll get over it. She makes a good case, though. A cute, assertive two-year-old can quickly become a rude four-year-old, and woe to the grandparents trying to deal with the back talking teen he/she eventually becomes. In her four step program, the author tells grandparents how to (1) recognize backtalk, (2) decide on a consequence for it, (3) enact a consequence, and (4) disengage from the grandchild's protest. The book is concise and convincing. In fact, I am so convinced by it that I bought five copies of Dr. Ricker's first book, Back Talk, as a Christmas gift for the parents of all my grandchildren."
5,Just what he needed ...,"... to feel comfortable again sitting on the toilet. My son had spinal fusion surgery and afterward, could not take the pressure point pain while sitting on the toilet. This cushion eased that pain tremendously. We also use it on his bath seat when he takes a shower. Highly recommended."
2,the lid that won't close,"the product is ok if you want a raised seat. The vinyl is not very thick and its durability is questionable. The worst / main complaint it that it does not close. You have to remove the old unit with lid and replace it with this ugly thing. For whatever reason some mfg genius has not offered a way to have a raised seat, and include fasteners/ hinges that allow you to use a nice looking lid-that closes--amazing. I don't like to have an untidy open toilet all the time.so it you don't mind a medical looking open toilet all the time for you and your guests---go for it. otherwise--sit on it ( your current seat i mean )steve ;amazon shop-addicted"
5,Incredible!,"This is deep, very deep. It makes you think about what's really important. How observant of a man to notice the little things that women go through. The author is definitely a deep thinker with emotions that go beyond the norm. I can't wait for his bestseller!...Lisa"
1,"Oh, brother!","Hey Paramount! Instead of wasting time and money releasing a two pack, how about releasing Season 4?"
2,Dosen't show much glitter,"The ring itself is a very nice blue. However, you can't see the glitter as well as you can in the picture. I was a little disapointed when I received it. I am going to keep it, just because it is a nice looking blue."
1,TERRIBLE Customer Service!,"I purchased this wax machine and received it in working order. When the heating unit stopped functioning, rendering the machine useless after 1 week I asked to exchange or repair the machine. Instead I was informed that my purchase was past the 2 week return mark which had been counted from the date I had PURCHASED the item and not when I had received it. I was told I had waited a month!? to inform them. Then I was accused of plotting to exchange another ""dirty and used"" wax machine from my spa in lieu of the one I had purchased and trying to scam them for a free machine! Absolutely ridiculous. After days of email banter now I have to go through the manufacturer myself to try and get a new item or warranty instead of the seller doing this for me which is the correct thing to do. I will NOT be purchasing from this seller ever again. ""Nail Discount """
1,"34.90 is still 34.90, ARE THESE REALLY LEATHER","I would love to know if these are really leather, they say they are..but they look and feel like non leather of some sort. AMAZON can you reply to this and verify. They do not feel like the quality of Kenneth Cole, could they be fakes. Does anyone out there know does Amazon ever sell fakes. Well I do not know whether to just keep them or send them back, my husbnd has narrow feet and says these fit really narrow. i do not know whether they are actually too narrow for him or not. he says they are fine...hmmm...If I were someone considering them I would tell you to take your 34.90 and go to Ross or Marshalls, both discount dept stores that carry name brand shoes. I have better luck there and at least you can see them and try them on..."
1,Looks good but no support,"I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews before making a purchase on a knee brace. This one recieved good reviews but frankly I don't know why. The fit was great and it was comfortable, but offered absolutly no support. Apparently these other reviewers knees are in better shape than mine because this is like wearing a nice sock and that's about it. The so called overextension stop works great, after you have overextended your knee already. If you just have a little discomfort with your knee then this might be for you. If your like me and need a real brace, look at the McDavid brand. They offer much more support."
4,"Good brace, carefull with size...","This is a great brace for the price.The only problem would be the sizing.Before purchasing I tried on other Muller braces in Medium (as this one was not available in stores) and then ordered this one; only to find that it is not a snug fit as the other ones were.I am afraid the Small would be too small, so I will keep this one.For info I am 6""1 and 160Lbs."
2,Slip sliding away!,For me this was still too bulky. I thought b/c it had the hinge it would minimize the slipping down my leg. How wrong I was. I would return it but b/c it was used on my person of course I couldn't. But Amazon here has a great deal on a knee brace I've been thinking about getting b/c it seems like the perfect brace that will keep constant the pressure I need on my patella tendon. It's the Tru Pull Lite. It normally sells for $99. They're selling it here in the marketplace for only $12.99 or something like that plus $5 - $6 shipping. They say if it sounds too good to be true it probably is. But I'm going for it anyway b/c this ain't working. So be forewarned guys and gals.
4,Great for skiing,"I like this brace for the comfort aspect, and it prevents my knee from rattling when skiing the chutes. I mainly use this skiing in the Tahoe ski areas."
5,great pool party music,steel drums produce the most soul searching sound. if you are unable to go on vacation this is one way to feel like you're in some far away tropical place. Can't wait to play this c.d at my pool party while i serve margaritias and find some time to sit in the jacuzzi and forget my troubles.
1,Cliched and amateurish,"I bought this book because the prologue caught me. Unfortunately, it feel apart in chaper one. I've finished chapter five, and I'm done with it. It's going in the charity bag. The prose is amateurish and uninteresting -- it's stiff with cliches, and the author ""tells"" the reader too much instead of letting the story tell itself. (Example: the introduction of Joan and Alex.) Also, the perspective is odd -- it feels to me like a book written by a man. The author appears to be ""looking at"" the female characters (external perspective), but slips easily into an internal perspective with male characters. In Henry Brank's introductory chapter (for example), the perspective was immediately and clearly internal. We are not ""looking at"" him, we are seeing with his eyes. This might change further into the book, but I find the prose style so dull and irritating that I'm not going to bother finding out."
2,Could have been better,"The book was somewhat cliche ridden with rich playboys and noble Indian stereotypes. I enjoyed the descriptions of the forest, but found the female characters trite as well. Are all female attorneys beautiful? I doubt it. While I applaud the author for not glossing over the brutality, I don't think I'll bother with the next book."
2,Short Changed,"Enter commentI was under the impression when I purchased this ebook that it was, in fact, a book - or, at least, an indepth article. For $5.95 I certainly expected more than 1 and 3/4 pages of type. This is such important information but I could have easily read it for free at the library. I am very disappointed in the lack of information in this very short article for such a very high price.Sincerely,Elaine Suranie"
5,Excellent!,"This book is excellent for the beginning home schooler, or just to suppliment the ""regular"" school student. It has lessons already written, on tear-out pages, and great ideas for continued study at the end of each lesson. It also has great assessments/checklists at the back."
3,Handy Reference,"Helpful for home schooling. Good ideas for explaining concepts to your kindergartner. As an unschooler this was useful for for incorporating concepts in daily living and direction for books at the library.Also, I can keep track how how my child is doing and not get caught up in curriculums ($$$$) I'd rather save that money and plan an ""educational vacation"".Highly recommend. Keep in mind that this is a daunting program if your little one is not yet ready- not all 5-6 yrs. are. so Relax and enjoy your kid!"
5,One Minute Guide,"The OMG is a required text in the United States Power Squadron's Seamanship class. It was chosen because it provides a clear and concise description of the COLREGS (Regulations for avoiding collisions at sea). Every boater should have a copy, read it, and read every couple of years thereafter."
3,"Cheap, Works good when it works.","Not really gonna recommend this product. It will work to hook up IDE drive to a SATA board. I use it for a second ""hard drive"" and as a back-up it's tolerable. It will stop working if you leave your computer idle. Not sure why. I have to reboot for it to be noticed... sometime 3-5 times. So my review is Low. It does work when it works though, and fast and reliable at that. Easy install."
1,Speed Bag,"The speed bag does not stick to the desk at all. My 11 year old son tries punching it and it will not stay put. Also, he broke it the first time he hit it."
4,Cool conversation piece.,A very impressive effect when a small item is positioned just right in the bottom dish. The cute little included rubber frog is a bit too big for the effect.
1,not what I expected,"The stickers are different from the ones in the photo, I would expect that they look much alike, at the end I bought them because I like the ones I saw, not what I received."
1,Caution to parents,"I have seen these stickers on cars along with the first name of all the family members. Just a word of caution to parents who do this. It gives anyone access to your children's names. Let's say you drop off your child somewhere (school, soccer practice, the movies or mall) and it's quite obvious from these stickers the approximate age and the name of your child. You have no way of knowing what type of person you are giving access to this information. These stickers might be cute, but I don't think it's smart to add the children's names to them."
4,Lawd have mercy!,"I got the blues so bad, I couldn't open my own eyes. Thought I was blind until I had to call my friend and say, ""come over here and open my eyes, I got the blues"". Hmm mmm, this here be the blues you play when you just got left behind by a mean mistreater. It be guaranteed to heat things up, so play it out on your porch."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I was most disappointed in this book. I was consulting with a banking client and I thought the book might offer some useful information. It is no more than a pamphlet, is poorly organized and not useful at all! Spend more money and get a useful book."
1,New Pooch Pads!!!! AWFUL,BEWARE OF THE NEW POOCH PADS!!!. I RECEIVED AN UGLY FLAT SMALLER PAD THEN WHAT I HAD ORDERED. NOT BIG ENOUGH TO EVEN COVER THE CARDBOARD BOX I USE FOR MY DOG WITH THE PADS. THE SMALLER PAD IS AWFUL..ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A MALE THAT HAS TO LIFT HIS LEG UP!!! YOU HAVE TO REALLY DO RESEARCH TO FIND THE OLDER ONES..I'M STILL LOOKING FOR THE 27 BY 28 SIZE. GOOD LUCK!
5,A realistic story with a gentle message,"Pamela is an only child and is jealous of friend Sam's seven lively brothers, so she returns home to prompt her parents to have more kids. That's when she learns about some of the problems faced by bigger families, and gains a newfound appreciation for her family's size as well as an understanding of how adoption works. A realistic story with a gentle message."
1,"Horrible book-perpetuates myth of shark as ""evil fish""","I can't believe this book was even published. Of course, I shouldn't be surprised since a lot of people who saw ""Jaws"" and eat shark fin soup are willing to believe that sharks are an evil fish, a ""killing machine"" just waiting to eat helpless swimmers. What a crock....for all of the research that real scientists have done on sharks, this book pretty much erases all of the work that they have done to show what sharks really are...the top of the food chain. NO, sharks to not EAT people. They mistake them for seals, sea lions, turtles. Let us not forget that WE are in THEIR ocean...not the other way around. Respect the animal and it will respect you!"
1,Very Disappointing,"I started this book wanting to like it but found myself consistantly disappointed. Lee Maracle's writing style is stiff and disjointed. The perspective of the character Stacey is supposed to be from the perspective of a naive, confused, 17 year old girl. Instead it reads like a grown woman reflecting back on being 17 with all the knowledge she has gained since then. The comparisons between the white world and the Native were stiff and contrived. The lack of development of Celia was disappointing and the additions of Raven and Cedar seemed tacked on and under developed. I recommend Tomson Highway's ""Kiss of the Fur Queen"" over ""Ravensong"". The characterization of Wesagechak/ Fur Queen is much more compelling and the story is much more interesting."
5,A book in the highest tradtion,"Tony has written a memoir that I read in one sitting. It held my attention from each short chapter to the next. I appreciated how humbly the events of his tours of duty as a machine gunner were told. Tony doesn't portray himself as a hero, but his deeds speak otherwise. Being a Vietnam Vet myself I was struck by a chance encounter he had with a ""striking"" Vietnamese lady 20 some years after his return. She thanked him for fighting her country, something no one had said to him since his return. Something most of us Vets never heard, ""thank you"". Thank you Tony for the wonderful book you've written."
4,And the world started getting smaller!,"This children's book is an account of the famous French aviation pioneer, Louis Bleriot (1872-1936) who was the first person to fly across the English Channel (on July 25, 1909). The book won the 1984 Caldecott Medal for best illustrations in a book for children. IT is an excellent book for use in a discussion of history, particularly the history of aviation."
5,good product,"My daughter loved this patch. It worked really well in being ironed on to the shirt. It was a bit smaller than we had thought it would be, but it shipped quickly and I would buy from this seller again."
1,Don't waste your money....,...3rd Party product was never received. If you can find it in a store buy it there.
3,Does a Decent Job,It does a decent job and is good for quick touch-ups. Not bad to have one in the office or to use at one of the many airport clubs that have them. A horsehair brush and elbow grease produces a better shine than this machine and its man made material pads. But the machine does revolve fast and is good if you are in a hurry. My three-year old nephew also gets a kick out of the machine.
2,head pulled off after a few weeks,don't bother with this thing. the head came away from the body and we could never get it to snap back in properly. a total waste of money.
5,Chinese Food in the West,"This book was informative and interesting about Western influence on Eastern foods and vice versa. If you like Asian fusion foods and want to know how it all began, this is the book for you."
1,Interesting,This peice was interesting but not enjoyable. i like this type of music but I did not like this.
2,dougv,"A good looking book by a caring Christian.She uses the King James Bible translation, which makes proverbs in the book hard to read.There isn't much revelation from God in the book, so I don't think it's worth reading.She spends most of time talking about the need to obey God and to seek His wisdom, which any average Christianalready knows.Therefore the book is not worth buying. I gave my copy away."
3,Works as good as any,"This product works as well as any product of this type - nothing to brag about but better than nothing. If you are close to it, there are probably less mosquitos, but I don't think it covers the area it says it does. But then again, none of them ever do!"
4,A good reference guide,"""The Poe Encyclopedia"" is true to its title. The entries are not particularly in-depth or comprehensive, but the listings present a fairly wide breadth of Poe-related topics, from his writings to his family to his employers through the years. Many of the entries are disappointingly and surprisingly short, but there are few Poe topics you'll find completely unrepresented. If nothing else, the biographical index in the front matter is a great reference guide if you don't know your John Pendleton Kennedy from your Edward Coote Pinkney."
4,"Funny, but is it really for young adults?","I was given this as a sort of 'gag' gift, since I was a fan of both the cartoon and the brief live action television show. I will say that this 'graphic novel' contains all the sly humor and off-kilter characters that appeared in other mediums. How can you resist that big blue guy and female characters named 'Oedipus'? Also, the whole ninja component was wonderfully satirical, and I loved Paul the Samurai with his 'killer loaf'."
3,Overpriced,"I absolutely love 3d puzzles. I've done the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, the Titanic, a 3 ft tall working grandfather clock, a lighthouse, the Capital Building, the Whitehouse, and i think a few more. I'm working on the Sears Tower and the Chrysler building right now. When they first came out, [...] stopped building them for a few years and recently found some at Ross for [...]shop around."
2,"Sad, bogs.","Pointless boring movie. Nothing to do with the title. I assumed/hoped it would have a point relating to Britain's banning of specific dogs, like pit bulls. A pit ~was~ recently put to death in England (first week of July 2012) despite having NEVER bitten or threatened anybody. It died for being the breed/type it was, not for anything it did.Back to the point: dull story goes nowhere, has little if any drama, humor, scares, etc. Spend your 90 minutes doing something more worthwhile.(edit: Looked it up. The dog was named Lennox, and was in Belfast (Ireland), not England. My mistake.)"
3,Mama Huhu,"The title is Chinese for ""so so"". Part one, his descriptions of his own life here in Beautiful Country are by far the best part of the book. It resonated with me mightily because it reflects the experiences of my wife (who is Chinese) and of my Chinese friends. Part two was a disappointment. It's not that my views differed from his, it's that they weren't particularly noteworthy. They didn't grab my attention the way occasional essays by Pierre Ryckmans, for example, grab me. Bai Shilu"
1,Awful,"If you order this do not order from Secondspin, they won't send you the protect. They'll say they ran out of copies, and you'll just be getting a refund and weasting your time."
4,"Sabrina, the 5th season","My friends roll their eyes when I tell them I am a fan of this show. They hated it. I thought it was a charming show, except for the last season. Good family entertainment. Clean. I really watched the show for the two aunts and of course, Salem, the talking cat. The only thing I found annoying from season one to the last season was the laugh track, laughing at stuff that was just not funny. I just don't like to be told when to laugh. If the aunts were gone and Salem was not present, I probably would not have watched this show at all. The last season, the aunts were taken off and only appeared in a couple of shows. Horrible decision."
1,More false-advertising from Pagels,"As I experienced in reading Pagel's book ""The Gospel of Thomas"", ""The Origin of Satan"" is another piece of false advertising. This book has nothing to do about the origin of the Satan myth. It is a great piece of theological exploration but it has nothing to do with the title."
4,Great,"I keep this on me at all times. Its a great resource for me while I am still learning the Catholic prayers. It includes instructions on how to pray the Rosary, the Our Father, the sign of the cross...and many more ""basic"" Catholic prayers."
2,Was looking for more.,"I just expected more from this book. The outside looks pretty but the inside has tacky illustrations and very basic prayers. This would be great if I was just learning about my faith and needed a supplement to follow with the mass or learn a rosary, but it's not what I was looking for. I'm afraid I have little use for this personally but it'd make an okay gift. Anybody know of a book with prayers to specific saints or more in-depth/formal prayers? I think I'll just find a nice copy of the Liturgy of the Hours or a breviary."
2,Only for Catholics,"I bought this book for the purpose to have some nice prayers to say to the many terminilly ill patients that I visit; big mistake. The preponderence of prayers in this book are geared towards Catholic themes like communion. I didn't find but a couple of short prayers that were universal. If you are Catholic, this book would probably work for you, but if you are another denomination, I would advise you to stay away. There are also many illustrations in the book that depict Jesus as a pale skinned nordic looking white man with long brown hair and beard to match; just a little bit off there, but I assume the authors of the book are just trying to appeal to the majority of the religion."
5,Wildly Neurotic Western,"Sam Fullers FORTY GUNS is nothing less than a neurotic and a psychologically perplexing and complex story that is truly beyond any measure of rational or conventional storytelling. The more I see it, them more bizarre it looks. Even though he made this at a major studio it is unlike his MERRILL'S MARAUDERS or HOUSE OF BMBOO also made for major studios. It has that definite Fuller look and feel. This is really a fascinating look at emotions gone booth recklessly uncontrolled and painfully restrained beyond the point of reason."
2,Just so-so.,"I did not especially enjoy this book. None of the characters are likable or sympathetic, and the writing style is disjointed, chaotic, and sometimes confusing. It reads more like a mental patient's journal at some points than a novel of fiction. I was hoping for a book more focused on the musical aspects of the story, but this seems to be written by a non-musician hoping to come across as very musically informed. I would overall give it 2.5 stars. If you're a musician looking for a mystery about violins or even just music in general, do yourself a favor and buy ""Paganini's Ghost"" by Paul Adam instead."
3,Interesting,"Em's story of liberation after her abusive and mentally ill older sister dies is a somber tale of what it takes to get on your feet for the first time ever. Throughout the book, I couldn't help but think Em is quite unbalanced herself, especially in her relentless following and obsession over her neighbor, Louise. Honestly, I found Em a bit disturbing and not terribly likable.What this book was good at was showing the inner workings of abusive relationships. As a reader, it's easy to think Em should just have walked out on Pamela and never looked back. As illustrated in this story, breaking free isn't so easy."
1,Christian Propaganda,"You should explicity forewarn the perspective buyer about this book. The writing of the book is fine. BUT, it is a big lecture on Christian religion and religious dogma. I would not have bought this book if I had known this. This religious thrust should appear in your book outlines."
1,Hype not History,"I was encouraged to purchase this book because of the way in which the content was organized. I returned the book for a refund after reading the chapter on Clinton. If one does a page count devoted to each of the presidents, one must assume that the authors feel, as Al Gore does, that Clinton will be considered one of our greatest presidents. It is mysterious to me how anyone, looking back on the Clinton years, could contrive an opinion, as the authors do, that Clinton's problems were concocted by a hostile congress. This is political hype not history."
3,A Matter of Preference,"I greatly preferred ""Shanties & Songs of the Sea"" by Johnny Collins to this CD. The main singers on Collins' CD have more baritone voices and there's backup singers for the choruses that really brings out the feeling of it being sung as it would have been on a ship by a crew.Paul Clayton sings solo and has brought in an acoustic guitar for backup. In my opinion, this just detracts from the authentic flavor of the pieces. Where Collins' CD puts you on a ship, Clayton's CD puts you in a recording studio."
3,Edward VII's Children,"It is a most unfortunate event that the author did not dig a bit deeper into the illegitimate birth of the issue from Susan Pelham-Clinton and Edward. Instead of saying Susan took the secret to her grave when she died at age 36, there was more that could have been brought to the light. Could it be that this birth produced not one, but twin girls at Ramsgate? William E. Gladstone may have resolved the ""problem"" by sending one to Australia and the other sister to America. Is this pure conjecture? I don't think so.This book would not have been so lackluster if Gladstone's personal records had been given a good search. Gladstone, a friend of Edward, was noted for never doing anything without a written record and covering over things that were potentially ""sensitive"" to the royal family. Victoria was ""not pleased"" with her eldest son or Mr. Gladstone. Even so, this book is still a good read.Burton Dale"
3,Very informative but of limited practical use,"Once upon a time, I tried to get my hands on cheesemaking. Having mastered winemaking and homebrewing with some success and being an avid hobby chef, I thought that can't be too difficult. However, after having bought some basic supplies, I quickly realized that the process of making cheese is far from trivial.Then I got this book, which was very enlightening in terms of my understanding of how cheese is made, but it helped me little to improve my cheesemaking skills. The best advice I ever got in that pursuit was talking to a Swiss ""Senn"" in the Glarner Mountains and then I gave up on cheesemaking....In summary: a nice book if you want some insight into the cheesemaking process, but on the ""how-to"" side, the book is of limited use once you have gone past your first steps."
5,A must reading for spritual understanding of Old Testement.,Have you ever read and read the words in the OT and have to re-read to understand what was said or why its there. Read the story of Esther thourgh the spritual eyes of Fuchsia Pickett and the word will come alive. God has a purpose and plan for everthing. This story makes it clear and you can see the Holy Spirit working it all out. We in the body need to excersize our spritual eyes and see what hidden treasures the scripture has for us.
3,a leader of educators,"Dr.Boyer's Scholarship Reconsidered: Priorities of the Professoriate is one of the most famouse works about American education.Two years ago I read the book in China.By the way, I'm a Chinese graduate. And I think it is a usful book for those who are intersted in Ameican higer education."
4,Hand drafting and rendering for architects & interior designers,"A must-have book for anyone practicing or learning the art of hand drafting and rendering for architecture or interior design. Included are line drawings of many different types of people in many different positions, scales and perspectives that can be copied and inserted into one's own drawings. The pages are perforated and can be torn out for copying, reducing, and enlarging."
1,Stay with Fiskars!,"This rotary cutter drives me CRAZY. Unless I meticulously align my paper with the grid painted on the cutting surface, I get a crooked cut. With every other paper cutter I have owned, I could simply bump the paper up against the raised guide at the top or the bottom of the cutting surface and get a perfect 90 degree angle. Not so with this baby. I also find the 12"" size limiting. And I don't recall any other brand of cutter becoming blunt so fast. Fiskars lost my business when they redesigned their rotary cutters making my dearly loved model obsolete. I was so frustrated not to be able to replace my old, worn-out cutting mat when everything else about it worked like a dream. But I've learned my lesson. Hello Fiskars--I'm back."
2,Not worth it,"I thought this book was awful. It offers very little original thought, and is full of wrongheaded and muddled thinking. I persisted through a fair bit of silliness, but I ultimately gave up after a chapter allegedly written by a mathematicatian got some basic combinatorics all wrong.It probably deserves 1 star, but I've given it 2 out of respect for the fact that they've attempted to tackle such a difficult subject in the first place."
1,Major disappointment,"Totally agree with reviewer ""bag""---would also add that I wish Cameron would find her original ""voice""---her writing style has become stilted."
1,One of the worst books I've read in a long time,"This is the first book I've read in a long time where I really truly didn't want to finish it, it was that bad. I wouldn't even rank this half a star if Amazon would let me; the writing was just absolutely atrocious, there were too many characters and plots to keep track of, the whole thing with Madge and Cyrus was just stupid and pointless, the ending was ridiculous and the characters were just stupid how they changed their minds every five seconds. It's truly a book you suffer through to get to the end. Unbelievably horrid; I never want to pick up another book by Cameron again."
5,Simply amazing!!!,"Zebrahead has to be the best band that has yet to make it big. Over their career, they have probably had about 15 songs that would be major radio hits, their last album was #1 in Japan, but still they have yet to make it big in the states. This DVD was filmed at their last cd release party at the Disneyland House of Blues and represents everything of why their live show is one of the best. Their hilarious on stage dialogue rivals that of the mighty NOFX and they play every song with emotion and energy. Buy this DVD! Even if you have never heard of Zebrahead, trust me, you will not be disappointed."
1,miniature ice cubes,"I thought this would make regular size ice cubes but even on the ""large"" setting these things are tiny and melt nearly instantly. I would'be sent this back but the shipping was exorbitant. Paying it both ways, I would've ended up with less than half the cost of the unit back. It now sits on a shelf in the storage shed waiting for a yard sale."
5,Great Product!,"I love this stuff, its affordable and does a fantastic job. My hair really does look healthier with continued use and the best part for me is no stickiness or ROCK HARD curls!!"
4,music that makes the movie,"I loved the movie but mostly because of the great music which ranges from Meryl Steep can really sing to the funny ""bad jokes"" with Woody Harrelson.The music in my estimation makes the movie and so the CD can stand alone."
5,Prarie Home Companion CD is a must for any music lover!,The songs on this CD sound even better than they did in the movie.My favorite tracks are the Woody Harrelson and Meryl Streep songs which I have been playing over and over.If you liked the music in the film this CD delivers. It is always great and refreshing to hear the real actors doing the singing.The video performances are an added bonus and looked great on my computer.Also it worked perfectly on my iTunes.This CD is a must!
3,Wonderful Story and Music,"I thought the story was very good. Meryl Streep can sing, but not as well as most of the other performers. It's unfortunate that really great music was faded out and overpowered by Ms. Streep's renditions. Maybe they should have casted a little less starpower that did not require over prominence in the film."
5,Breath Of Fresh Air,"This book was a breath of fresh air on 2 levels. #1, it is good to see another point of view than the media's constant ""Islam is a religion of peace"" campaign. And it is good to see facts and data, rather than slogans and sayings. #2, it is a breath of fresh air because it is not your typical anti-Islamic literature. This writer was not mean or evil, but had a seemingly honest concern about being accurate and about reaching people. I cannot agree with the view he has presented, but I think the author has atleast challenged my thinking a little bit about 09/11/2001, Islam, and Jihad. I am glad I bought this book, and I highly recommend it to anyone seking more details about other views and opinions of Islam and terrorism."
4,''Batboat or Batjet?'',"I HAVE A SIX YEAR OLD SON WHO IS COMPLETELY OBSESSED WITH THE SHOW THE BATMAN.HE GETS UP BETWEEN 10 AND 11 EVERY SATURDAY TO WATCH THE SHOW.HE SAW THIS ONE EPISODE WHERE BATMAN IS CHASING JOKER,BUT IT LOOKS LIKE HES IN A BOAT(BATJET).AFTER MY SON HAD SEEN THE VEHICLE HE ASKED TO GO TO TOYSRUS. WHEN WE GOT THERE ALL WE SAW WAS THE BATMOBILE,BATCAVE,AND MOTORCYCLE.MY SON WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.BUT WHEN I WAS DOING MY CHRISTMAS SHOPPING WITH MY WIFE WE NOTICED IT ON A SHELF RIGHT NEXT TO THE BATMOBILE ALONG WITH SOME NEW FIGURES.I PICKED IT UP AND NOTICED IT SAID 3-IN-ONE BATJET.I FIGURED IT WAS A TYPO.WHEN MY SON RECIEVED IT ON CHRISTMAS DAY HE WAS VERY HAPPY.ALTHOUGH IT SAD BATJET ON THE PACKAGE HE STILL THINKS ITS A BATBOAT.IT ALSO BECOMES A CYCLE WHICH I THINK IS PRETTY COOL. I GIVE THIS PRODUCT A 4 OUT OF 5 BECAUSE MY SON ENJOYED IT AND SO DID I."
1,I wonder if this work is plagiarized as well,"Colin made it to the headlines of major Finnish media today as ""his"" other book is a direct copy of Mika Waltari's (seeLindum Colonia). I wonder who really wrote this one?"
1,This watch died shortly after purchase,"The watch is pretty but it is thicker than it looked in the pictures and fairly heavy for its size. I had to pay a jeweler to remove links from the band to make it fit. The watch died only a few weeks after purchasing it, and a jeweler assured me that it was not due to a dead battery. Fortunately, Amazon.com is great about returns and refunded me my money."
1,Bad decision,"We've had this refrigerator for just over 1-1/2 years. It has broken down once (right after the warranty expired) - same issue as others had (the fan). Is is noisy. The freezer handle has broken off completely once, and has popped off again since being repaired. The interior drawer cover is worthless. The stainless steel is of poor quality and is easily dented (even dropping an ice cube on the top of the freezer drawer is enough to create a dent. One of the worst appliance decisions I've ever made."
2,Failure prone,"After three years, the internal freezer fan motor failed. An online search shows this to be a common problem."
2,poor product,"The have very poor product, i bought this preduct in may 2011, it brok down within 2weeks. Now am havining the same problem again."
5,Oryx Goat Whey Protein Powder,"For starters, I am food sensitive to dairy products and I experience moderate unwanted symptoms when I consume them. Usually, I use hemp and rice protein; but now I use Oryx aswell and experience no symptoms. The only difference that I can tell is the flavour as my diet is inconsistent; but when I use, say, Iso Whey PP I experience gas symptoms and very mild stomach disomfort. So, overall, I recommend the Oryx PP to anyone who has a dairy allergy or is food sensitive and if you are unsure about your food tollerances look into getting yourself checked out on a vega machine with your local naturopath doctor. I hope this helps-Hardgainer"
4,"Interesting, not well organized but a good book to read through and very informative","This is essentially a collection of the 365 most commonly asked questions about babies. The subjects include dealing with colic, bottle feeding, bathing, discharges, circumcision, fevers, teething, among many, many others. Although this differs from most other books on this subject by using the question and answer format it is still quite informative and useful. With an extensive index you can look up any problem and find an authoritative answer from doctor Zukow. If there is one baby book that I would most suggest to allay the fears and concerns of a new mothers this one is it."
2,Closed Caption or Subtitle on ADAM-12 5 to 7 DVD?,"I need to know if ADAM-12 5 to 7 DVD with closed captioned or subtitle? I had noticed ADAM-12 Format is not list closed captioned or subtitle. Let me know, thanks."
1,Somewhat Un-Royal,"This sound effect-less VERY Abridged version is, at times, barely audible....It truly lacks any production quality at all.....If you are looking for ANY drama....look elsewhareDisappointing......."
4,"Bishop Noel Jones, Pastor City of Refuge, Los Angeles, CA","Born A Bastard is a tremendously passionate autobiographical adaptation of the life of Rev. Calvert who, after finding the key to himself, freely opened the door and became transparent for all to see his process. This definitive translation should leave you blessed and encouraged as you journey with him on the road from 'Bastard to Born Again.'"
4,Wonderful Album !,"I gave 4:5 stars ... it is a GREAT album ... not one of the best albums of all time.These guys just don't get the credit they deserve ... they rock. I saw them in 1999 outdoors at Alice Coopertown Phx AZ ... they rock. My other 2 albums from Dishwalla are among my all time favorites. This is smooth, well engineered, and lays out cool melodies ... this is creative electronic pushing rock. I especially like the rolling over and phrasing of drum licks ... this is not just straight 4x.My album cover doesn't have the sexy tattooed babe in panties on the cover though !! 8*)"
5,"Dishwalla ""Collides"" with Talent","Dishwalla as a band has increased their talents and musicianship, and this new album is almost an encore to their last three albums. It has the loudness of ""Pet your friends"", that undeniable alternative ambiance of ""And You Think You Know What Life's About"", and pure emotion of ""Opaline"". The songs are tied together well, like a story. ""Ease the Moment"" sounds like a hard rock comeback to ""Angels or Devils"". ""Creeps in the Stone"" is a haunting requiem that shivers your bones. ""Collide"" is rich in tone. ""Life for Sale"" has an addictive rhythm. J.R.'s voice gets more amazing with every album, and this album proves that. Yes, Opaline was magical, but this album has a new kind of magic. Dishwalla shows promise in the future, and their best album is yet to come."
4,Incredibly overlooked!,"Came across this album a few years after its release and I was wow'd.Saw them on some free tickets during the Pet Your Firends tour in a club with about 200 other people. One of my most memorable shows, still sticks with me to this day all these year later. Super clean and oh so good. They opened with Pretty Babies, the lights were down with the instrumental coming in and then BAM lights up and full speed ahead. You could get as close as you wanted. Good stuff!"
4,It is just right for us.,"I received this in good order. The assembling was a bit tedious, but it is a fine product. perfect for our use."
5,tub transfer bench,"This transfer bench worked very well in providing the stability my mother needed in order to move into the bathtub for her morning batheing. It was not difficult to assemble or adjust once it was placed over the tub. Be careful that you check the measurements. The legs needed to be elongated in order for it to fit over the side of an old fashioned claw foot tub. There is a kit designed for this purpose, but we used the adjustable legs off one of her unused walkers to raise the two legs on the outside of the tub to get it high enough to clear the side."
2,Just couldnt get into it....,"""Veils of Silk"" was just not for me. I didnt connect with the characters at all. I thought that Ian's issues were justifiable, but the reasons behind Laura's troubles,I thought, were just stupid. I can understand being upset over her father's death and all of that, but refusing intimacy because of her parents torrid relationship was just such a weak plot device. I also just couldnt get into the setting of this book at all. I couldnt finish this story...so why not 1 star? Its a Mary Jo Putney. I have many of her books and think that she is brilliant,unfortunately, ""Veils of Silk"" just fell flat."
1,Visine tests on animals.. no thanks,"Was about to buy.. looked them up to see if they still test on animals, they do (part of the Pfizer umbrella) There are other alternatives to this, yet they choose the cheaper/more hideous route. No thanks.Pfizer (BenGay, Desitin, Listerine, Lubriderm, Plax, Visine), 235 E. 42nd St., New York, NY 10017-5755; 212-573-2323)"
2,dried my eye more and became dependent,"Occasionally I'll get dry eyes due to being on the computer all day and/or because I wear contact lenses. The first use of these drops provided temporary relief (a few hours). However, I noticed my dry eyes got worse on subsequent uses. After using these for a 2nd and 3rd day, the dryness was probably the worst I've ever had so I stopped using them since this was only making them worse.I eventually found better drops. If you're having dryness caused by wearing contact lenses, I highly recommend these instead:Bausch & Lomb Sensitive Eyes Rewetting Drops, 1-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)."
1,A lot of misleading information.,"This book is unfortunately an useless one.It is very appealing in the title, but have a lot of impossible to understand drawings (null quality), wrong captions, missing data, some nonsense definitions (like Neuber's rule in pg 46) and so on.On the other hand, the book presents a lot of interesting information about FEA and experimental data, but the reader must be very careful in use them.Sincerely I dont understand as a publisher like Kluwer print a book without any major revisions!The book is not a cheap one, but it don't worth your money."
4,Pretty good,"I certainly wouldn't pay $600.00 for this comforter. Not what it was originally ""worth"" according to the seller. However, I do think I got a deal. It's pretty good quality and looks good. Did I get 85% off probably not. It is an excellent product for it's price of what I paid."
1,cannot hardly make out what is said,"tapes sound like copies of copies of copies. I bought this with great disappointment. What a waste of money. Also, the people speaking sound like hebrew is the most boring language on the face of the earth. Don't be suckered into this one. It genuinely stinks. This is poor, poor, poor. At least make the recording off the original copy."
3,"LOVE this show, but the production is cheap","The storyline on this show is great. It is a true to life depiction of the LGBTQ community, however, the production is cheap and the acting leaves a lot to be desired. Once you get past that, the show is awesome. I think it is great to support up and coming directors and casts."
4,Informative and Well-Written,"I made this purchase two years ago as a research aide for a project for a college course. For the segment on Sir Thomas More, it was all I needed and saved me from having to file through several online sources for conflicting info and questionable citations. James Monti is a true scholar and it shows in his work. Anybody interested in King Henry VIII, Catholic/British history, or even the notions of civil disobedience ought to read this."
1,I bought this on my kindle,Sentences were missing - jumped from one subject without a segway - the only way you got this book was to see the movie. Poor kindle adaptation!
3,Lost in My Kindle,"An interesting book, but my Kindle edition had a lot of totally unreadable pages - it looked like smudgy print-over-print in a tiny font size that I couldn't enlarge . I don't know why. I obviously missed large portions of the book. I thought I should go to the library, pick up a copy and see what I missed, but I never got around to it - too many other good things to read."
3,Interesting...,"This book was somewhat difficult to get through. The author changes narrators frequently, making the story hard to follow at times. The characters are odd and not relatable but still it was somehow compelling and worth a read."
2,Not a fan-- especially on kindle,"Finally caught on to what this book was doing in the last few chapters, but absolutely hated this book for most of it. I recommend not reading this book on the kindle, as I did. Several chunks just don't make sense. I need to find a hard copy and flip through, just to try to understand what Foer was doing in some sections. I enjoyed Oskar, the main character, but would've enjoyed him doing something more than just running around the city. I just didn't care for the plot, and so was not motivated to keep reading this book (thus the three months between beginning and ending...) And the renter just seems like an awful person in all of his flashbacks, so I struggled with how likable he was supposed to be now. Maybe this would've been a good short story?"
1,"Convoluted, contrived and entirely depressing","This book jumps around so much and is repeticious in the conversation, that at times you aren't sure if the person is actually speaking or the boy is remembering it. It reads like an old Italian Western...boring at best. I struggled and pushed myself to continue reading it until I got half way through and realized that it hadn't gotten any better. Don't waste your money."
4,Great read ... something different!,"This was definitely an interesting book and not quite what I expected. Really enjoyed it. Don't know how the heck they are gonna do the book justice in a movie, but will certainly be sure to see it!"
1,dissappointed,Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close was not the type of book I enjoy. I rarely ever start a book that I dont finish!!! However with this one the thoughts were so unjointed the plot jumped from place to place- I couldnt keep up with the dialog. One main reason I quit reading the book halfway through- I dont like bad language- and this particular book was full of bad language- cussing etc. To me the young man had an anger problem- and it didnt impress me to like the book!!! One of the few books I have quit reading in the middle of it- and I wouldnt go to see the movie either!!!!
2,Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,This is one of the strangest books I've ever read. For some people it may have been a work of art-but for me it was just hard to follow and very unbelievable. I unfortunately was disappointed and hope that the movie is better!
1,Weird & Disturbing,"This book did not meet my expectations, the characters are disturbing. I read this book as part of my book club and only 1 of the 9 liked it."
2,Extremely mediocre and incredibly disappointing,"The author/publishers seized the opportunity to make a buck off those of us who want to find something to help us heal from the horrors of 9/11. This is not the book. It was annoying to try to determine who was speaking (the young boy, the grandmother in the present, the grandmother in the past, or the grandfather). It jumped from one to another and from past to present and back again. It was also annoying that the author felt the need to use the title adverbs repeatedly throughout the book. I truly feel I wasted a few dollars and several hours when I could have been reading something more interesting."
3,extremely confusing!,"I think maybe the movie would probably make more sense to me than this book did, I had a hard time ""reading between the lines"" trying to figure out who was speaking at the time and what the heck they were talking about. I got the gist of some things but not all of it even by the end thus the 3 stars."
2,Incredibily Close and Confusing,This was not what I was expecting. I had trouble understanding what was going on even tho I am a psychotherapist. I would have liked a little more background.
1,don't get it,Please help me to understand why anyone would enjoy this book. I found it so difficult to read and forced myself to finish it- but felt I did not understand the novel nor did I want to.
2,WASTED TALENT,"AFTER READING THE BRILLIANTLY WRITTEN 'EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED' BY FOER, I WAS EXPECTING PERFECTION. THE WRITER HAS TALENT BUT 'EXTEMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE' IS A LONG, DRAWN OUT YAWNER - THE ENTIRE BOOK IS THE SEARCH FOR THE MYSTERY OF THE MISSING LOCK, WHICH IS ACTUALLY A SEARCH FOR HIS FATHER. I WAS READY TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN AFTER THE 2ND CHAPTER."
4,Sad Book,"This book made me feel like a child. It is in touch with the innocence of children and it made me feel very sad. It wasn't a bad book, though. The utilization of typography and photos through-out is a nice touch, but maybe a bit overdone."
1,Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,I did not like this book at all. There seemed to be no substance and the ending was inconclusive. I can't belive a movie was made based on this book.
2,None,"most unusual book I have tried to read. after paying for it and seeing ads for the movie, I really wanted to read it but it is difficult to follow."
2,Not enjoyable at all.,"I agree with other reviewers that said some will love this book and others will hate it. I fall into the latter category. The main character is unlikable to say the least. I thought the style of writing was hard to follow and ineffective. For me, this story was a big miss."
5,Enjoyed it!,"Our book club liked this book! Even though half of us didn't like the little boy, Oscar, at the beginning, (too cute, too precocious) he grew on us and very soon all of us agreed we were overtaken by the beautiful human situations and lessons in the book. It was a nice read and a different slant on grief and survival. Recommend it."
3,Difficult to read,"The writing is very good, but I didn't realize the topic was so difficult for me to look back upon. I rarely put a book down until I'm done with it, but this took awhile for me to read. Again, not the lack of good writing, but the suffering that it so competently portrayed."
3,It was alright,I Tried to read it before I watched the movie but I couldn't get into it. I didn't like how the characters kept switching I was often confused as to who was who.
1,"Glad I skipped the book, the movie was very disappointing","I wish I had read reviews for the book before renting the movie last night. Pretty much every negative comment about the book, sums up how I feel about the movie - 9/11 is just the backdrop for the story and the story meanders all over the place, there are several plots going in the movie. Acting was superb but since the book is difficult to finish and categorize, it makes sense that the movie would turn out the same way too."
2,I start to read this book with Great Expectations,"since I loved Everything Is Illuminated so very much.Unfortunately this one did not work for me. And I tried hard at least not to be overly disappointed. But I was at the end. I even read comments and insights on this book so it would help me to see more, something what I am missing...But not - it felt too forced, too self-indulgent, too contrived...I wish Mr. Foer will toss everything behind, sit in dark room and start whole writing from beginning again - just writing with his wonderful talent, not trying to show off and overwhelm readers with his creativity."
1,Warning - portions unreadable on Kindle generation 1,"I was struggling with many of the same issues voiced in other reviews - contrived, predictable, etc. The deal breaker is that there is an entire chapter that is unable to be read on a Kindle {at least generation 1). From all indications, this is a crucial chapter. I am extremely disappointed that there was no warning to this effect. Where is the quality control?"
5,Buy 10 Copies,Buy this book. Then buy nine extra copies. Give them to your friends and family. They'll thank you for it. I loved this book. It's smart and funny and touching without being sappy.
2,Did I miss something?,This book was simply not my cup of tea. I just didn't get it. It was kind of all over the place and got annoying after a while.
3,Got there in the end,"I'm torn between giving this book 3 or 4 stars. For the first 66% of the book I thought it was just okay...and about then something clicked and I really started to find it interesting. But that said, I needed to have read the earlier part of the book for the latter part to make sense. I liked how it came together around the 66% point - and couldn't wait to finish from then. Not sure if I would recommend it or not. I finished it with a good feeling so I guess it's worth a read (although I'm glad I got it at the discounted price of 25c)."
3,A terrible good read.,"I have avoided reading this book because of the trauma of 9/11 and all the unanswered questions surrounding that event. We all lost our innocence on that day and to relive it through the eyes and mind of Osker is gut wrenching. Then throw in the fire bombing of Dresden and you have a juxtaposition of horrors from two separate generations taking center stage(and both perpetrated by our government to boot). It took work to read this book. I'm not sure if it was worth the emotional trip, but Osker is a refreshing companion on this ride."
3,Tragic and uplifting,I love the narration from the point of view of such a smart and quirky kid and though the story is good it does feel a bit contrived.
2,Disappointed,I was so surprised that I did not enjoy the book at all. The storyline is not nearly as powerful as the movie which I loved.
2,I just didn't get it,I'm not sure what's wrong with me or maybe all of the people that loved it?! Either way I didn't like it. All of the characters are completely whack and at first the transitions between different narrators don't make any sense so I was lost and not sure what's going on for a while.The idea of a little boy looking for a connection with his dad is great and that's why I gave the book 2 instead of 1 stars.
1,I didn't like it,"The book was entirely too ""noisy"" for my taste and it is one of the few books I QUIT READING"
1,"Terrible, Boring, Pointless and a Waste of Time","The one-star review entitled ""Recommended for faux-hip pseudo-intellectuals, people suckered by saccharine emotion"" precisely sums up my opinion of Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. This book is full of unrealistic, self-absorbed drivel. I managed to finish the book but only because I found myself skipping entire pages in order to get through the story."
1,When the author is too incredibly loud and close for his own good,"There are moments to admire here, some beautiful and touching language and insights, but ultimately the narrator is just too precious and precocious, as if the writer himself were too enamored with what perhaps is a thinly-veiled re-creation of his own wunderkind boyhood self. The wise naif perspective has tempted writers for generations, and often works (Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha by Roddy Doyle is a good contemporary example) when the kid is allowed to be a kid, even if a smart, intellectually curious and intelligent kid. While a dose of sentimentality is welcome in an era of cynicism, this book gets downright treacly. Also, the sly or not so sly allusion(s) to Gunter Grass's Oskar is problematic, since it invites direct comparisons that don't serve this book at all. This might have been much more successful as a short story or even a novella, to avoid all the self-indulgence."
3,Only ok,"Not the type of book I usually read, and I'm tired of 9/11 stories. I didn't find the main character believable because he didn't exhibit the true nature of the disability given to his character. also the side story of the grandparents went no where and tended to be vague at times, and the mother was irresponsible."
1,Disjointed,"I wasn't sure about this book but I downloaded it anyway. For me - HUGE mistake. The point of view changed constantly leaving the reader confusedand disjointed. Even when I don't particularly like a book, I commit to it and read it through. I can't force myself to do it this time. I've stoppedreading it halfway through and have no desire to finish it. It's almost as if the author wrote whatever came to mind at the time giving no thought ofcoherence or cohesiveness in his story. Don't waste your time or your money."
5,"Great book, not great Kindle experience","This book is creative, touching, intense, and complex. A great read. Sympathetic main character. My only regret is that it is not optimized for the Kindle ereader experience. There are a number of pages with text that cannot be enlarged on the ereader because they are images. I recommend reading this as a real book or on an ipad, though I have not tested whether the latter will indeed allow you to enlarge those text images."
1,like the author has ADD,"I love to read books, but I will tell you this is one I did not finish. After working to follow the story line for 20 minutes, I finally deleted it from the Kindle. The author's writing style is very hard to follow. It jumps all over, and I could not find a plan or plot in it. Very boring.And there is some content that is sexually mature, so I would not want my 13 year old daughter to read it."
2,Kindle Edition has bug,"Wonderful story amazingly drawing, however tried to purchase 2 times on my kindle and at 85% it turnes into a hashed miniature unreadable mess for about 5% of reading... really unfortunate that you can't complete reading this, tried to read it online and on my ipod ran into the same problems. Talked to 3 friends who had the same problem, ended up going down and purchasing the book from a local bookstore to be able to read the entire thing. Wonderful story but hope the bug gets fixed soon, would love to have it, bug free, in my kindle library."
2,Too long- boring,"This book started out great! The boy's humor pulled me right in as I read the sample. However, the whole long search in NYC could have been shortened. I feel confident that this will be the only book I have read where the movie will be better. I kept wanting to know more of the mom's feelings. I guessed some of the ending, but it could have been a little more satisfying."
5,"Intriguing plot, great language","Couldn't put it down. Amazing language and characters, with fascinating illustrations. Sad, funny, gives me hope for modern fiction."
4,Good Book,"It was a very good, easy read. It is thoughtful, tear-jerking and youthful. However, I probably would not read it again."
3,"Not Bad, But ""Illuminated"" was better","I liked certain elements of this book, but all together it seemed to ""clunk"" along. Everything is Illuminated had very similar elements that worked to a more exhilarating effect."
2,easily broken,"First 10 minutes the chopper crashed and now the tail rotor doesn't work. Better to buy two of these and use on for spare parts, since to order spare parts will cost too much in shipping!"
5,Jokes are not a joke,"For Freud jokes were not just fooling around, not primarily a means of play, not in short something of trivial importance. Rather they were expressions of our deepest instinctual drives and needs. Like errors in everyday life they are governed by an inner intentionality, and purposiveness.Here it might be said that Freud exaggerates or is too extreme in his point- of- view and does not explain all humor by it."
5,Coenzymated B-6,Love this size of the pill and that it is not flavored like the first one I bought. It was flavored with pepperment. Highly recommended for sensitive individuals.
2,Natural Tea Tree Tooth paste by Desert Essence With Fennel and Baking soda,Tea Tree And Baking Soda Is Fine ! Fennel Is Nasty ! Stick with Tea Tree and Mint ! A Good Combob !
5,Gentle and clean,"Leaves your teeth feeling very clean! The taste is less sweet than other toothpastes, but I like it that way."
5,Good natural toothpaste,"I bought this because I was looking for a natural toothpaste that didn't have a lot of disturbing artificial and chemical ingredients. I have a lot of sensitivities and allergies. I also like that it has tea tree in it, so it naturally disinfects the mouth as you brush with it. the flavor is pleasant and it leaves my teeth feeling clean. I am planning to buy it again!"
5,A beautiful gift,"I was lucky enough to receive this book as a gift from one of my best friends when I lost my brother to cancer last year. I read it when I have had a bad day and need to be comforted, it is a wonderful way to let someone know that you care about what they are feeling and going through."
2,Amateur Hour,"Seldom has a movie with such good reviews come up so short on actual viewing. To begin with, it looks extremely cheap, shot in low-contrast grey-on-grey. Most of the actors just seem like hammier-than-average actors reading their lines; very few are actually bring a part to life. The scenario is rambling and pointless, and the few amusing gags are repeated until they become dull. There's no reason to care about any of the characters. Primarily it reminded me of a community theater ""melodrama"" production, except it lacks the immediacy that makes such a thing bearable. If you're looking for a good spooky movie spoof, I'd advise watchingYoung Frankensteinfor the 14th (or 16th or 20th) time, orThe Fearless Vampire Killers, to see this sort of thing done right."
1,They changed my favorite wand,"I have been using this product for 2 years and have loved it. I just bought myself a new one for Christmas. And it's awful. The pencil is hard and no tint seems to come off it. It's like pulling a plastic tip across my skin. Whatever Mally did , please go back to your old creamy formula. In the meantime I will be returning this."
2,Disappointed,"Like others, I read SO much about this amazing product, I got hooked. It's not the least bit soft or creamy, and the tiny point kind of tears at your skin while applying. It is an effective cover-up. Oddly enough, while sorting through some old (very old) makeup, I found a very similar pencil with a sponge at one end, but thicker and much more effective. Quite sure I didn't pay more than a dollar in those days."
5,exactly as described!,"i can't give enough praise for the quality of these headphones. i'm not actually using these for their intended purpose .. i am a very light sleeper and sometimes the smallest noises will wake me up .. since buying these i can actually sleep and hear NOTHING .. the isolation and noise reduction of these muffs is top notch. i can actually SLEEP with these things on they are so comfortable .. to top it all off, these are made in Sweden.update: After a few years of regular use the pads were getting a bit stiff so I bought another set in 2012 and this time it's made in USA. Just as pleased with the 2nd pair. Another tip, these work well on top of ear bud style headphones so you can listen to music while these are on ... near complete isolation that way."
2,Poor quality,"I recently purchased this, and when it arrived one screw was missing. I purchased a replacement screw, but when I began to assemble it, the holes were misaligned, the stain was irregular, and a large, ugly spot where the rattan was inserted was visible from the opposite side of the wood. It was such poor quality that we decide to use only the salt and pepper shakers and toss the napkin holder. The salt and pepper shakers appear to be well-constructed and uniform, although the color is a bit more red than I prefer. I would think that the manufacturer would repair the screw alignment issues since it's been stated in the reviews numerous times over several years. I'm surprised Amazon continues to carry items from this manufacturer. I would not recommend this product!"
2,High hopes....crushed,"I was excited to receive this item, which I purchased for myself, however that quickly changed when I opened the packaging. First I noticed that the wood stain wasn't even, as it appears in the picture but streaky. I didn't mind that too much, figured, once assembled and filled, most of that wouldn't be noticeable.The assembly part is why I'm really rating this item so low. The holes for the screws don't line up! I ended up sending the item back for a refund, but am so dissappointed in the poor craftsmanship."
4,Ooh La La,"I ordered this for a Murder Mystery Party.. I was expecting a flimsy, uncomfortable costume, but was pleasantly surprised to see that the outfit fit great and was well-made and comfortable to wear, as well."
1,Do not buy this book,This book has a great name but the book does not contain any substantial information related to debugging. Most of the information in the book are not for serious programmers.My strong suggestion is do not buy this book for ASP.NET debugging or for ASP.NET as some of the reviewers have mentioned.
1,A JOKE,WRONG ITEM SENT 3 TIMES. WRONG PACKAGING. MISMATCHED ITEM INSIDE THE WRONG PACKAGING. ITEM VIEWED ON INTERNET WAS THE WRONG # OF THE PRODUCT SOLD. A REAL WASTE OF TIME AFTER SPEAKING WITH 3 FOREIGN CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS. AND A SUPERVISOR FROM INDIA.
5,Gouverneur Morris,"I really enjoyed this book about an important founding father that I had not known much about. The author did a great job of describing Morris's large personality and the important events that he lived through and helped shape, and in the case of the French revolution, helped shape his views. As a New Yorker, I also liked all the references to events and places in upstate New York."
3,"Great service, kind of pathetic product",I had to watch this for school. I ordered it and the company that sold it to me did a fine job. The DVD itself is a little lack luster and I dont think it is all that strong in its arguments.
2,"Dry, Boring, Uninteresting","I bought this movie to show to my high school students. Usually any kind of movie, regardless of its quality, is well-received. However, many of students said they would have rather done worksheets than watch this movie. It is extremely boring (I had trouble staying awake). And while the information is interesting, the movie doesn't go into anything in depth."
5,Easy recipes for wonderful food!,This cookbook has several wonderful recipes.The Hoisin baby back ribs & Vermont coleslaw are great for summer meals! There are great tips and excellent menu suggestions too!
5,I really liked this book.,This book would make a great movie. I would recommend it to all my friends.
1,Technically Flawed CD,"Legacy did a very poor job of transferring a very good original tape recording to CD. It actually sounds like they used a duplicate tape intended for a 33-1/3 record pressing instead of the original master tape recordings.The audio equalization is so bad the mighty Wurlitzer organ screeches and grates on the ear. George Wright's Banda CD remasters are far, far, better. Legacy needs to redo this recording and volume two as well.Bill Wood"
3,A Surprise Hit,"Barbro Lindgren offers bare-bones text and straighforward drawings in a simple story of Sam, Doggie and his new potty. Its simplicity reminded me of the classic Dick and Jane readers of long ago. In the competitive potty book market rich with rhyme, color - even movable parts - I mistakenly thought that Sam's Potty would be quickly dismissed. But my girls liked it! One scene in which Doggie unravels ribbons of toilet paper so Sam can wipe is hilarious.After reading over two dozen potty books, I regard Sam's Potty as more entertaining than educational. Read it for fun! Then when you want to introduce the functional aspects of the toilet training process, try these more instructional potty books: The Potty Book for Girls by Alyssa Satin Capucilli or What To Expect When You Use the Potty by Heidi Murkoff."
4,"Attractive, Useful","The holder is very adequate and attractive. Cigarettes fit in perfectly without having to be ""squashed"" into the holder opening. The hole in the mouthpiece is also sized reasonably enough to create a very nice draw. The cigarettes seem to have a metallic taste at first, but after smoking several in the holder this taste subsides as the inside is seasoned.The only complaint I have with this item is that there is not enough of a barrier between the cigarette and the mouthpiece. In other holders I have owned a partition with a single hole is placed in such a way as to bump up against the filter of the cigarette. This prevents the inside of the holder from becoming ""gunked up"" prematurely. I wish this particular holder had sported that feature.However, all in all it's a good product and I don't regret adding it to my collection."
5,amazing!,some bitter memories for an english person but GREAT all around i very much agree with the goals on this tape!
5,101 Outstanding Goals!,This video is great. It captures fantastic moments in the Premiership. I never get tired of watching it when I need a quick GOAL fix. Enjoy!
3,Decent jam but definitely not the best for me.,"Hi everyone,So, I've been living in France for a bit and have noticed this jam everywhere at the regular supermarkets. I've also noticed it in Whole Foods back at home, though it is not sold in France at the bio co-ops or natural grocery stores. It's also sold here in France for a fraction of the price in the states of course.A friend bought this one and I had this on toast. It was good, but overly sweet! I could taste too much sugar, which overpowered the raspberry flavor. I do not think it was horrible, but the sugar was definitely too much for me. As for spread and consistency, that gets 5 stars. But again, I've tasted better jams in France and this one was just mainstream for me."
3,Good but not Great - not worth the Sugar calories,"I had high hopes for this product after reading some of the reviews - the flavor is good, the consistency is a little thin and the seeds seem excessive even for Raspberry Preserves. The jars are a nice shape and easy to hold. I'm not sorry I tried it but will not purchase again - I wanted something with GREAT flavor that is really worth the calories and this isn't it!"
3,Bollywood sountrack,"I love indian music, this music sounds like an Indian spy movie soundtrack...very dramatic at times-very bollywood sounding. It's not bad, it almost sounds like they're poking fun at movie culture. I prefer a more real sound when it comes to the sitar. It is fun to listen to, but I'll take Shankar over this any day."
1,Worst razor!,They cut your skin but not your hair. Never again will I buy these!! Even the cheap bic razors are 100x better than these. They simply don't cut any hair what so ever.
4,Works Great But Has Proprietary FME Connector.,"I tried a Wilson dual band magnet mount antenna #301103 but it wouldn't pick up any signal so I sent it back and bought this #301101 trucker antenna, mounted it on a magnetic base for a CB antenna and stuck it on the roof and it works great. The first one must have been defective. The only drawback with this one is the cheap FME connectors that Wilson uses that break easily and are not compatible with anything else so you have to buy one of their special adapters or a pigtail with the correct ends on it to connect to your phone.Update, this antenna won't receive anything on the 1700Mhz band used by T-Mobile for ""4G""."
5,great product,Great product. Have used this same pad with my older son during gis vedwetting days. Washes and dries great. I have never seen this at such a low price.
1,Used and unusable,"This is my first real disappointment with an Amazon purchase. The description lists this item as New. And for $30, this would be well worth it if this were the case. However the one I received is clearly not new. Second, of the two metal lines is bent out of shape and flattened to the point that it would restrict the flow of fluid. Lastly, one of the two ends is missing the line bold that fastens the line to the transmission. The only reason I gave this one star right now is Amazon said they would replace it for me at no charge, and will be emailing me a pre-paid shipping label to ship it back. I'm just hoping Amazon makes good on their promise and ships me out a new and usable part."
1,Sticker Impossible to Remove,"I don't care how wonderful this bowl is, I'm ready to toss it (got it as a gift) because of the %$#@ing sticker on it! what is the point in putting a sticker on something that will be used to prepare food that can't be removed without toxic chemicals!! The idiots at the OXO should have tried removing these stickers before deciding to mass produce them. I've tried everything including Goof Off and still can't get rid of it!"
5,Best Movie You Never Saw,This is such a great movie.....kids and adults will love it. I plan on buying several copies to give as gifts to family and friends. I will never understand why Millions wasn't released on a larger level or with more hooplah! It was the best movie of the year (in my opinion). Highly recommended.
2,Overrrated,"If you're thinking, ""It's from the guy who made Slumdog Millionaire"", it must be good""...think again. Film has a few really good moments, but the ending was so sappy and unbelievably predictable I left the theater shaking my head. Also, portrayal of LDS missionaries on the cul-de-sac was so ridiculous I realized, ""the screenwriter doesn't do homework on his characters."" It was a weak suckerpunch on religion. Overall, the film has some funny bits, but it's kind of dumb and the characters are unworthy of sympathy."
3,"Beautiful, but odd","I enjoyed millions, but I also have reservations about it. In some ways it is a wondrous, beautiful film: visuals, editing, score and cast are terrific, but the balance just seemed off to me. The haunting visions and childlike fantasy sequences just seemed to crash up against the more sordid crime-driven plot whenever the villain is on the scene. In one way it grounds the film, but in another it also makes it seem disjointed. All in all, well worth a view for it's high points but not the real achievement it could have been."
3,Not up to movie soundtrack,"Hoped that the CD would have a quality cut of the Third Man Theme. Well first, it's ok, I'm glad to have it, but it sounds as if he was on Seconal when he recorded all the tunes. To my knowledge there is no CD soundtrack of Third Man, too bad. That's why I purchased this one. All the wonderful arrangements and pace that are on the movie soundtrack are missing."
4,Hot Coffee to Go,"As far as keeping liquids hot, this is the best travel mug I have ever owned...and I have owned many. The tumbler keeps my coffee at a HOT temperature (not just warm) until I have finished the last drop. I really like the design and simplicity of this mug as well. As an added bonus, it is very easy to clean. The only negative I have is that it is not fully spill proof. I knocked the mug over the other day and a small amount of coffee did come out onto my desk. It wasn't a whole lot, so clean up was easy. Overall, I am very satisfied with this product."
5,text book,"I loved this class, I am really good at most school subjects and love to learn and found the subject fascinating."
2,Not for intro courses,"This is a typical mammoth intro textbook, which means it is far from adequate for intro courses. The authors assume that the student is going to devote eight hours a day to the intro course alone, a rather unrealistic expectation. There are dozens such textbooks, none practical. What the point in a many-page bibliography, which not even one in a thousand is even going to consult? It's about time we came down to earth, and started writing intro textbooks for intro courses."
1,horrible gate,"We couldn't even install this gate, because it arrived warped - the door of the gate would not close, because it was not level with the lock. Does this company ever check the quality of their products? For the price they are asking for it, there should be a much, much better quality control. I am extremely disappointed with this gate. Obviously, it is going back ASAP!!!!!"
3,"Not great, but it fits the opening","This is the only gate I could find that would fit my 46 inch opening, had a gate, and was short enough (no taller than 29 inches) to fit under a counter that sticks out about 5 inches from the half wall into the opening needed to be gated. I give it 3 stars because it does fit, it does have a gate, and it is pressure mounted. The reason I didn't give a higher rating is I am sure some toddlers will easily figure out how to shake this gate into popping open. I don't know if the gate I got is broken but you don't have to use the thumb release to open it. You only have to slightly lift the gate and it swings free which is why I'm sure some toddlers will be able to shake this gate open."
4,LOVE THIS BABY GATE!!!,"I LOVE this baby gate!! It took me forever to order a gate, because most of the gates online go to 52""...our space was just over that but under 53"" This gate worked perfectly for the space! It was definitely somewhat of a pain to install which is why it is 4 stars instead of 5! I love the way the gate looks and the fact that it is self-closing and opens in both directions. LOVE THE GATE!!"
3,Harder to use than expected - better for a permanent than temp installation,"THe good news: this is a sturdy, well-made gate that looks attractive.The bad news: it is a pain in the neck to put up and take down. It's best used for a semi=permanent installation, otherwise the tedious screwing and unscrewing of the pressure mounts at 4 points is too much. The actual swinging part of the gate won't work unless the tension of the pressure mounting is really high, so there is no real ""casual"" installation of the gate for a few minutes or whatever. Also, there are white warning labels at the bottom of the otherwise attractive black gate that won't come off. I have yet to try to soak them off in the bathtub, but I think that is what it would take. Really detracts from the appearance."
2,Works great as my dog gate.,"The gate is good quality for the price - much better than other options I have tried before.My only issue is the installation does not seem to be error proof. Although my mechanical skills are limited, this seemed like a no-brainer tension style gate. However, once I was done the center walk thru portion of the gate would not latch. It is a swing open style now that only looks like it is secure. This is not a problem with my situation because I use it for my dogs who are good about not pushing their way thru. However, if you were hoping to keep children in or out of a space, that would be a big issue."
1,Contains chemicals that cause cancer?!?!?,"What is this ""Proposition 65 warning""? It says this product contains chemicals that is known to cause cancer, birth defects and other reproductive harm. Is this a mistake or what? I contacted both amazon and dreambaby but no response so far!"
5,Just what I wanted!,"I purchased two of these gates. One to put at the bottom of the stairs and one to put upstairs before ""the bridge"" that leads to the staircase. So far we have only installed the one at the bottom of the stairs. Works great. The button you slide to open the gate is tight enough that I think it will be awhile before my granddaughter can slide it but it is easy enough for adults. It can be noisy when it shuts but the acoustics in my foyer is terrible. The gate can be left slightly open for when the baby isn't here or is sleeping. The walk-through-opening doesn't seem to be large enough at first but when you realize it is only your legs going through it is appropriately sized. I have already recommended this gate to other family members."
5,great sturdy gate,"We really are happy with this gate. It looked at firs like it was bent, but that's the design that allows it to be under pressure for a tight fit. It is high quality, looks nice, and doesn't damage our walls (we didn't screw it in - just used the pressure). It is easy to operate with one hand. A great gate!"
5,We Love It!,"This gate is awesome! I love it because it keeps my son out of the kitchen, and my son loves it because he can pull himself up by holding the rails. It is VERY sturdy! I can lean on it and it doesn't budge! I am VERY happy with the purchase."
1,IMPOSSIBLE,"It is 1 am and I have finally installed this gate so it will actually close. My hands are bright red and throbbing, and I have pulled out most of my hair. I cannot describe to you how difficult it is to get this thing installed so that it will latch closed. After I tightened it to the point of worrying about my drywall cracking, the latch was still a full inch from the frame. Are you kidding me? If only it were easier to return. It is now so tight that I am sure I have damaged the wall, and I wonder if I am skewing my whole stair banister from the pressure. A baby gate should not be this difficult to install. To get this gate to simply latch shut (which is somewhat important in a baby gate) you have to tighten the tension knobs well beyond what the skin of your hands can tolerate. I used rubber grips to help me, and ice packs in between efforts. Seriously. I would have much preferred to drill holes in my walls."
4,Ok gate!,"Ok gate, my son figure it out how to open it at 18 mo old, so went to plan B and did tie a scarf on the lower part of the door to keep it shut! Overall sturdy but you can find better considering Customer Service does not exist in USA, Canada only without toll free number, not good!!!!"
5,Works Great,Works Great easy to install built to last glad i bought it nice value came fast like the color also
2,I was a little dissapointed.This is way far from being a good DP doll.My neice hated her and the dress ripped fast.My neice didn,not good if looking for a perfect DP doll Forever hair Ariel is it.
5,An outrageous dark comedy,"""Cuckoos"" is a 3-character, 3-act play by Giuseppe Manfridi (who is described on the book's back cover as ""one of Italy's leading playwrights""). The English version is by Colin Teevan. This book also contains a short preface, entitled ""Manfridi and the Theatre of Excess,"" by Peter Hall.""Cuckoos"" is an absolutely outrageous comedy. It opens with two of the characters (a man and a woman) naked, and painfully locked together in an act of sodomy. When the young man's gynecologist father arrives to try to help separate the two, the play becomes even more outrageous. As the characters explore both their present predicament and their past lives, the audience hears a story of sexual shame, secrets, revelations, and anger.The play is full of sexually explicit language. There are some slapstick sight gags. The dialogue crackles with naughty wordplay and insults. While ""Cuckoos"" may be offensive to many, I found it to be a marvelous and memorable reading experience."
1,Utterly Terrible,"Their music makes me cringe... pure and simple. I know that if I meet someone who enjoys this music, I instantly hate them. And, if I instantly hate someone, I can probably bet that they would like this filth."
4,Solid Songwriting,"While not every song this band produces is outstanding, some of it is, and Hey There Delilah is one of them. Lots of whining about this song by the ""too-cool-for-the-room"" types out there who hate anything evocative (the oft-overused EMO tag, which means nothing now and never really has), mostly because the only emotions they know are anger and cynicism. This song is as real as any other good ballad - if it had been written by Paul Simon or Elliot Smith there would be no negative reviews. It either means something to you or it doesn't. Ultimately, whether music is good or not is up to the listener, so attempts to pull the song apart critically just lead to the usual boring chain reaction event that blasts any ballad ever written, no matter how good or bad. Such a drag."
2,Great....at first,"This product looked great when it was first put on. But because the strip is not tight enough against the grout, it allowed some water to get in and poof...mildew. So I had to remove it and re caulk with regular caulk. It looked great for a few months but this is not a long term fix."
1,Looks nice but didn't stick.,"The products does have a professional look to it and was easy to put on, but unfortunately in my case it did not stick which makes it useless."
1,Disappointment,This game was recommended to me by a friend so I thought it was going to be a sure fire winner. Unfortunately the learning curve is steeper than I'd like for a party game and the overall game itself is much better in theory than in practice. The trivia is mainly from decades ago so if you are under the age of 40 you might want to think twice about picking this game up. I would recommend Time's Up or Loaded Questions. The former is a fast paced party game while the latter is a fun way to get to know people.
3,Forgotten thriller.,"A group of foreign drifters find themselves together on the Costa Brava in the off season. Their motives are fuzzy, their pasts unclear, and as one of the character notes they are all either ""running away from someone or chasing someone"".The book starts with Mio almost being killed and possibly being rescued, and she fights for her life as she tries to sort friend from foe and understand who she needs to trust to stay alive...K.G. Ballard was one of the pen names of Holly Roth. Published in 1957, time stands it well. It is an interesting little thriller that keeps the readers guessing and holds the interest effectively."
2,This is made for a person with minature legs,"The quality of the fabric and stitching appear to be very good. It is comfortable and warm. However, the fit is anything by normal. The crotch is halfway to my knees and the pant length is very short. I am 5'9"" and weigh 185 and ordered a large. My inseam is 30"". The shoulders and sleeve length fit comfortably. The pant length goes just to the top of my boots but when seated on my motorcycle, they ride up to above the top of the boots. Hence, my legs get cold and it defeats the purpose of having an insulated suit. When walking the very low crotch is cumbersome and just plain looks silly. I returned this item."
4,immoral women,First saw this trio of movies at a film festival in Christchurch many years ago in a heavily censored version.Don't think that this trio is a good as the Immoral Tales from the same director but still worth while all the same.Nice to have a decent refurbished copy to view of these unusual movies.Will be watching out for other product from this controversial director particularly if the quality on dvd is a good or even better than this one is.
5,phenominal book,"Very short book, definately a one night read. But so much meaning is within the pages. As you unfold the meaning of life, you are just carried away with this book and can take into context your life as well as others around you. ""We are all terminal, some are just lucky enough to know it"" is among one of the many very inspirational quotes withing the binding. I would reccomend, great gift idea as well."
5,great tool,"I bought this book just before I seperated and began reading it with my young children as soon as I told them what was happening with our family. They realized right away that it was a Marc and Laurie Brown book and were excited about reading it. It's been almost two years since we first opened the book and we still read it often. It helps me talk about our changed family in terms that they can understand. It also helps me to understand what my children are feeling, it's much easier for them to tell me when they can look at a picture and relate to what the character is feeling. I highly recommend this book to any family that is facing divorce or that has been through it. It also deals with the changes that may take place long after the divorce. GREAT BOOK!!!!!"
3,"useful, but I didn't love this book-","I was given this book by a friend who is a school counselor. My ex is getting re-married, so I was looking for a resource to explain marriage/stepfamilies to my son (4yrs old). That section of this book was very helpful to us.I did read the entire book to him but skipped over the page with the mom swigging the martini! Drug use/alcohol abuse could have been addressed in a better way, or in a different book.I think some of the information about divorce wasn't as relevant for us- we have been divorced and in two homes since my son was a baby. However, if you are going through a divorce, and your children are of an age where they understand what is going on around them in the household, this book would be a useful tool.My son likes ""Two Homes"" by Claire Masurel, and ""Good-bye Daddy"" by Brigitte Weninger."
1,BEEPS NON-STOP,"This radar detector beeps at everything! trees, cars, the white lines on the road, EVERYTHING.in a 60 second time span, it did not beep for 4 seconds.i tried highway mode & city mode. no difference."
1,Moved on to the Valentine1 after a ticket with the X50,"All I can say is after much research, I bought the 8500 X50 from Best Buy. Three weeks later I get a ticket and my unit never flinched. The cop even went back to flip it on for me and I got one dot. Needless to say after spending $369 then getting a $185 ticket, I got my money-back and have switched to the Valentine 1. The directional arrows are a great asset. Much better rear detection too! Spend the money, buy a Valentine 1 and be done with it!"
4,Escort Passport 8500,I bought this radar detector about a month ago and I've been completely satisfied by how its worked. It seems to be the best detector for the price when I researched them and I feel like I got my money's worth. Its easy to learn how to use it. It's sensitive but not overly sensitive and I'm pretty sure its saved me from a ticket at least once already.
5,Great product!,"Blue light are actually worth the extra money, sonce they are less noticeable at night to others. Easy to use, and works great."
3,Ok till the warranty runs out,"I have 3 of these, was so impressed with performance of first bought 2 more 8 months later. Then the trouble started, Shortly after warranty runs out each detector started chirping away for no reason or saying service needed. Send the first one back, needed new antena, sent the second, same thing, now about to send third at $60 each repair. Voiced my complaint to rep, told me we must be misusing them. Leaving them on overnight...NO...Extreme heat or cold...NO..I live in NJ we do not experience extreme weather. Using a splitter and plugging in another device thru lighter...NORep was rather rude at ESCORT repair desk...Now reading all the reviews I can see there is a problem, most reviews were written early on...Problems start after 1st year. A $300 unit should not require a 4^0 repair every year....Think twice...I will pursue this with management at ESCORT"
1,It Will Not Last,"I concur with the reviewers who wrote about the deterioration of the capacitors from daily sunlight exposure. Mine is three years old. I had it repaired a year ago for $60. Again it displays the ""Service Required"" message and is inoperable. Escort says it will cost me another $60. Enough! Get a BEL RX65 instead. That's what I'm going to do."
4,good could be better,"the window mount is terrible and uselessi would recommend a visor clipif a cop is coming towards you running radar, this will tell you a good 10 seconds before you see him, however, it doesnt do much for you if a cop is approching you from behind or u are approaching a cop from behind. This has saved me a few times however and ive only had it for a month"
1,I would not buy this product next time,"1. Too big,2. After 2 weeks of using the Police stopped me and I need to pay ticket (no warning from Radar Detector) - I think that is enough reason for not buying this product.3. Many false alarms.4. When I use this product I do not have any real alarm - but in this time I noticed many Police controls on the road.I hope it would work better in the future."
3,"Nice purse, but not as nice as I anticipated","I like this purse overall and decided to keep it, even though it wasn't quite like the picture.Minus - The leather isn't as soft, supple, and smooth as the picture appears. The purse is taller looking than it appears in the picture (that is, the real purse looks taller than it is wide). It's a little narrower than I anticipated. (And, yes I know they give the dimensions.)Plus + There are 3 large compartments (2 zipper and 1 in the middle) plus 2 outside zipped pockets, and 1 inner zipped pocket). The lining is nicer than I thought it might be, based on other reviews I've read. The zippers and shoulder strap are nice."
3,Do you enjoy this?,"If you enjoy the following you need this collection.The Coast You hear the sound of waves gently lapping on the shore as you approach the wide beach that extends as far as you can see to the east and west. Fish swim and splash in shallow pools near the waters edge, and you can just make out the forms of dolphins playing farther out in the open water. There is an enemy villager here > hit villager What do you want to hit the villager with? > inventory You can't hit the villager with that > inventory You are carrying: a basket an axe a pick a large bone > hit villager with axe You can't do that > hit villager with pick You can't do that > hit villager with bone You bone the enemy villager The enemy villager leaves > quit Are you sure [y]? > yes Your score is 0 (total of 350 points), in 0 moves. This gives you the rank of Beginner."
1,Not a good value,"For a child's abacus, this brightly colored wooden toy is nicely made. However, consider the ""very similar"" :DMelissa & Doug Classic Wooden Abacus; compare the difference in value for yourself."
3,"Great ideas, poor execution","The projects in this book are definitely cool. However, I encountered two substantial problems.First, it was difficult to find some of the supplies. I live in a metropolitan area (2 million people) and could only find one place that sold liming wax. I spent an hour on the phone calling places looking for it. I finally found a supplier 40 miles away.Second, the colors in the book are quite different than in person. I added the specified amount of artist's paint to create the terracota fresco. The color was suppose to be orangish. It turned out to be pink. Let me tell you, my husband did not appreciate that at all.My recommendation, take her ideas, but don't use her colors."
2,Artograph Design Master Projector design master projector with stand,I am not happy with the limited size of the item that i want to copy 9that i can add to the projector). I should have held out for a more expensive model
2,Broken Boot! Not for serious skaters!!,"I've been an avid skater for years and I went with K2 because my best pair of skates were K2s and lasted for SIX years before I had to replace them. I purchased the K2 EXOs for this reason.....now I admit that for the past 2.5 months I started skating for fairly long distances (20, 24 and 28 miles), I was training for a skate marathon. Within a week BOTH of my EXO skate boots broke! I'm furious because they won't cover the junction between the upper and lower boot! They have 2 bolts there that obviously will not hold up. I know how to tighten my skates, so a loose skate was not the issue...the plastic bolt that was not designed for serious skating is the problem. I'm buying another pair and I'll shell out the big bucks for these.....I'll never give K2 my money again though.If you're a serious skater, find another skate!!"
5,Satisfied Architect Studio,"Our office is very happy with the benefits we have gained when using Corel Draw X3 when finishing up our floor plan designs for houses and condos we are working with, it has the proper amount of tools to develop them fast and with excellent quality."
3,Water Buffalo Days,"I read this book after reading ""The Land I Lost"" by the same author. This book,""Water Buffalo Days"", did not even come close to the very interesting book of ""The Land I lost"". As is often the case, the author wrote his best stories of his life in his first book and didn't have much left for his sequel, which is what ""Water Buffalo Days"" is."
4,"5 stars for content, -1 because the soft cover fell apart","This is a great book, as long as you don't read it so much. If you open it too many times, pages start to fall out. Georgi's super mathematical, so it'll help to know linear algebra and diff. eq. Problems are pretty varied, from easy to somewhat hard. Nothing impossible though."
3,None of those women were me.,"As a women, a mother, a wife, a student and a teacher, I did not see myself in any of the women in Nice Girls Don't Drink. My life is successful. I have not had any of the ""consequences"" of heavy drinking but for more than three years recovering from my love affair with alcohol has been foremost on my mind. Perhaps there are others out there, who, like me, drink too much but don't fit into to the ""AA"" mold of an alcoholic."
4,[Insert title here],"I have not much to say. But for being from New Orleans and being rescued and all and trying to get used to a new school, it was tough. Then I failed math. Even worse. But this book so far is helping me catch up."
2,chinese boots look like seconds,These boots are not crafted very well. The detail leather has cuts that are sewn over and I believe I paid full price for seconds quality. whats worse they were almost $40.more than the last ones I got.dont expect too much!
2,Strange mixed bag,"This CD is indeed a strange mixed bag. There are plenty of authentic traditional pieces, but there are also a number of modernized vocal numbers (rather western operatic style singing), one good Okinawan folk song, and believe it ir not, one Korean traditional song (Arirang) sung in Korean accompanied by kayagum. What's that doing here? It's nicely done, but overall I don't understand the compiler's choices."
2,Samurai Song? oh no,"I've heard this 'Samurai Song' before.At emusic.comno!This song is korean song. name of 'ARIRANG'I'm sure, this track has wrong _ _"
3,i remember japan,i remember japan was recorded on fiesta record company new york u.s.a. it was recorded in europe . if you have any imformation please e-mail me at imzoso4@aol.com it would be most thanked . very iterested in buying.p.s.could be from 1930 -1950 thanks again.
4,Good story but....,"I love the story line of the book...and i hope it will get the funding to be made into a movie, because I think the author has a more visual mind.That being said awesome story, however it could be more detailed. It would benefit from being articulated in a different way. I think if Ray Stokes had another person edit the book, it may have been even better.I do like the story very much and do not regret buying the book and reading it, I enjoy analysing differences between literture and film adaptations, and believe that a film of this novel would be phenomenal, as actions and dialogue do not need to be articulated, and it allows for a visual response as opposed to an intellectual one.Great story, a bit of a shame about how it was articulated.I would still buy it again."
1,Frisbee.,"At the beginning of each track you get to hear a little bit of the guitar playing that I bought the disc for, but then all the horrible sounds that is supposed to be singing I quess, starts in and ruins any expected enjoyment. I went out to the balcony and sailed it like a frisbee."
5,Amazingly Good,"This pot is everything one could want in a workhorse saucepan. It distributes heat evenly. The lid is excellent and does not fog up when cooking, so that you can see what's in the pot the entire time it cooks. The surface redefines ""non-stick."" It sheds water so well that it's virtually dry the moment it's washed. I inadvertently left the heat on under the pot with a cup or two of soup still cooking and then went out to the store. When I returned, the soup had, of course, turned into a mess; as soon as it cooled, however, I could easily peel the stuff off. Under the gunk, the pot remained in perfect condition. I expect to have and use this saucepan for many years."
4,"Nice, but definitely smaller than I pictured","Nonstick finish is really excellent - you hardly have to scrub ANYTHING. Like, even dried-on pasta sauce will just rub off. But, I didn't really realize just how small 2 quarts was - it's barely large enough to cook a single serving of pasta in. No matter, it's still an excellent sauce pan that seems like it will last a really long time."
5,The best surfspot guide to the California coast.,"Eventhough its been around for awhile, this little guidebook is still da best brah! And at less than $11.oo it's a steal. Lots of maps, photos, and interesting descriptions make it a good thing to have if your cruising the crowded Calif. coast."
2,Not so great...,"As far as orchestral performances go, this one is not so hot. It's a high school band meets Lawrence Welk...good but not quite good enough. I'm still waiting for the bubbles to come pouring out of my chandelier. It has a few high points here and there, but only enough for a 2-star rating. If you have ever heard one of the Reader's Digest orchestral compilations from the 50's, you'll have a flashback."
2,The Music Matters!,"Without the original music, the show suffers. It IS about a '70s radio station after all...it NEEDS the music of the era. Plus, Les needs ""Hot Blooded"" playing while he dons his toupee. Without the music the joke of that scene falls flat.With any other show, the music might not have mattered. However, WKRP DOES need the original music!!!!!!!"
3,Deserves to be released in DVD,"With all the DVD releases of vintage comedies, one has to ask why WKRP remains in VHS only? This was a great comedy, on par with such classic 80's sitcoms as Taxi and Barney Miller, yet it finds itself in video purgatory, along with other great shows of the era such as St. Elsewhere. It took awhile for WKRP to establish an audience. I remember how it got pushed around from one time slot to another, never getting the attention it deserved then. But, it produced such memorable characters, with Loni Anderson, Tim Reid and Howard Hesseman all enjoying success after WKRP, albeit Loni never got as good a role as she had as Jennifer. I suppose it is only a matter of time before we see it on DVD, but it has been an irritatingly long wait."
1,Needs the ORIGINAL Music to get the stars it deserves!,"When you're releasing episodes of a series about a radio station playing only GOOD Rock'n'Roll music...it's pathetic bordering on criminal to release this video with ALTERED music. If you can't be bothered to pay for the rights to the music we all heard the First Time we saw these shows...WHY in the name of the Universe should anyone BOTHER to pay a dime for this watered-down, pitiful attempt at giving us a classic comedy show.Let's see a DVD release soon with the music as originally HEARD on this fantastic show!"
2,Not an easy cure for allergies and asthma!,"I really was interested in this book for treatment of my allergies and asthma and hoped it would offer some great alternatives to using medication. However, I found the book to be very detailed and a little too restrictive in terms of diet for me (I don't do well with ""diets"". For someone who is a little more disciplined in their diet, this would probably be a great help. It is a well-written book, but just not for me."
1,yuck!,"I was shocked when I received this book. It is simply a pamphlet in my opinion. It is tiny and barely has anything in it. If you already know Spanish I would NOT reccomend this book. But, Amazon is great and gave me a full refund!"
2,Small and of limited helpfulness,This is a one dollar book at best. Not really as helpful or as well organized as you would think. The same goes for other books like it that I bought. I don't have much else to say as it doesn't deserve much more than a don't buy.
5,A little squirt will do!,"This is a great product but must be used sparingly or you'll end up unhappy as other reviewers. It's the only product I've found that is easy to use, gives truly shiny hair, and lasts a long time. Because it is a spray your hands don't have to get messy. My hair is a few inches below the shoulders. I use three squirts around the top and three around the middle before drying. That's all that's needed."
2,"Simple Win95, Java, Too in Depth","This book tries to cover C, C++, Win95, The Borland environment and Java. IN ONE BOOK!!! This can of course not be done. The C and C++ parts are good indeed, except that Herbert has a tendensy of going to much in depth when talking about a function, it usually gets boring. The desciption of the BC++ environment is just as far as typing in dialogs and stuff, something which a programmer should be able to do. The Win95 part doesn't get into talking about why things are as they are, it's just create a button and write some text, the Petzold surpasses this piece of junk-write by a factor of 1000. The Java primer is just something Herbert put together to get some extra attention, you hardly learn to write text on the screen. Maybe i'm being a bit too hard, but this book shouldn't be bought unless you want to bore youself to death. Anyway isn't everyone using MSVC++ now ?"
2,Jimmy,The book is well written but it isn't C...Schildt makes glareing errors and lot of the samples just don't compile...I wouldn't recomment it to anyone who ever wants to programme for a liveing....
4,Values All Families Can Live By,"The ideas are practically presented in an easy to digest format -just one morsel of information a day to put into use. These ideas are not only for children, but adults could learn something as well.A couple of ideas I particularly liked were: * Have a family motto each month, with the application visually depicted. Post it on the refrigerator or bulletin board, so everryone can learn it. * Encourage your child's EFFORTS by showing him how pleased you are when he tries hard and finishes. (rather than the outcome) * Avoid paying your children for chores that are a function of being part of the family. Instead, offer them a chance to earn extra money for doing chores beyond their daily duties.These ideas are simple, effective and ""do-able"" for any family."
2,Not Sufficiently Scientific or Philosophical,"One of the primary problems with this book, as any one familiar with the philosophy of mind will know to wonder about, is what this book could say worthwhile about consciousness. The answer is nothing. The one good thing I will say about this book is some of the information it contains is mildly interesting to the neophyte of psychology, but, as I said, only mildly.Going further, this book has some serious issues, which many philosophers of science and scientists have with psychology, namely, that psychology can be wildly unscientific. Such is the case in this exposition. Overall, I would have to say that this book should be avoided on the basis that it is not rigorous, lacks content, and simply incorrectly titled; this is not an introduction to consciousness. The book is well written, and I do not doubt the author's competency, but this work is a failure."
3,SARK,"Haven't gotten all the way through but was drawn by my identity in the title 'procrastinator'. Have already been inspired to follow my love of photography by studying,producing some lovely photographs - enjoying the doing.SKB"
5,A Dream Come True,"Well, SARK has done it again. What a wonderful addition to her creative collection of books. She is so uplifting and inspiring! No matter what point you are at in your life, this book is a wonderful guide to discovering your dreams. Come see what awaits you..."
5,Pre- and post-surgery use,"I underwent maxillary sinus surgery two weeks ago. The ENT (ear, nose, and throat) doctor prescribed this type of rinse to be performed twice-daily prior to the surgery and 3-4 times post surgery. I flushed 6-8 times in the days immediately following and it did not hurt at all. I have tapered the rinses off to two a day; one in the morning and one in the afternoon (too late in the day and you may get post-nasal drip when you sleep). I plan to continue rinsing my entire life. Other thoughts: 1) the bottle provides excellent flow control, not like Neti pots which rely on gravity, 2) the 16 oz bottle may be more useful for some (I plan to order it), 3) the designer of this product provides an excellent pamphlet and answers many questions, and 4) the ENT considered this procedure as the single most important element of my recovery and continued sinus health. I believe many people could avoid surgery by practicing good sinus health with this type of product."
5,Awesome!,I just love these movies! Its a cheesy bad movie meant to be cheesy and bad. A great movie to watch with friends and have a good laugh.
5,Great book & CD,The book is a fun & interesting read with many unique insights.I have actually played the CD during these winter months just to hear the great outdoors. It makes the house sound like spring time with the windows open.
5,Bissell Vacuum bags,This was a perfect replacement product at a great price. We've already used one bag and it works just as the OEM ones do.
2,Anyone who can slog through this deserves a medal.,"Thw author is the bishop of Lincoln ,nebraska,and has become famous[infamous] for his actions against""liberals"".Supposedly a brilliant theologian{his humility must cause him to hide it VERY well],his writing is pedantic,heavy handed and simply boring.He comes off as a silly outtake from a failed saturday night live episode.A hero to catholic flat-earthers,he is a parody of an ignorant cleric.Unfortunately, he seems to have no sense of humor."
4,Great Organizing Tool,"As a soon-to-be new Daisy scout leader, this book was really helpful for getting a broad view of the group, and some activities to coincide with my troop development. I would recommend for the new leader..am enjoying going through it and brainstorming ideas."
4,Very Good Reference for Instructor and Lecturer,I found this book is the best choice for someone that is teaching the subject. Of course for the beginners the book is quite difficult to understand. I have been looking for Data Structure books and at last I found the best reference for me. This book is actually too detail and thus fully describe each of the data structures that exist in programming. They also provide sample programs. I hope this book will always be available to students of Degree and Master level.My advice for the novice : Try to understand each of the data structure and why they are important in programming. Then refer to your instructor if you do not understand.
1,Not useful,"It is just a very cheap product. Not comfortable, not easy to use, doesn't even fit well. Connector between two earmuffs is very stiff to manipulate"
3,check the picture,"I just got my iSight today and guess what? I need to get the accessory kit to mount it on my flat panel display. If that requirement is in the above verbage I missed it, but the picture shows it happily on the top of the display. I'll add on to this once it's connected ( sitting under the display till UPS brings the accessory kit)."
5,Very nice,"But what else would you expect from Apple? I plugged it in and followed the onscreen direction. Within two minutes, I was looking at my picture on the monitor. Awesome!"
3,Not totally forward-compatible,"Microphone works only on OSX 10.4, 10.5, 10.6 (maybe 10.3 and earlier too, but I don't have those to test on). Microphone doesn't work on OSX 10.7 and 10.8, according to my customer who returned it, and many users on support forums and other Google search results (which everyone should read before they purchase a discontinued product such as these external iSights)."
3,make your own,"These straps work OK but I had some lumps where they go around the bra strap and hook onto themselves. Also, I had to put them on before putting my bra on, which meant putting the bra on like a shirt - over my head. So, I decided I could just do something permanent. I ended up just hand sewing a length of elastic between my bra straps. That works fine."
1,I should have listened to past reviews,"One of the past reviews indicated that the product had been previously made with snaps rather than clips and that she prefered the snaps. What I found was that the clips were unusable; i.e., impossible to secure. I'm sorry I wasted my money."
1,Increadible,Recently I purchased this course for my girlfriend. This is Brazilian and not Portuguese. For somebody that wants to learn portuguese this course is a rip of. As a Portuguese I feel sad that my native language is beeing presented to the eyes of the world as Brazilian. Legaly I think that no company as the right to advertise yellow and sell red. In the packa
4,mastering portuguese,"This book was very good, but it had one major problem. It completely ignored the future tense. Although you have other ways of expressing the future, for understanding it is probably important. I found the book to be very helpful and the way the material is presented is fabulous. However, the promise of complete fluency is totally impossible. The lack of vocabulary made it unrealistic to expect fluency from this book, but I did feel that it is great as a supplement. It is a great way to start off, but total fluency from this book is just a lie. Overall I would say that this is a worthwhile purchase"
3,"Not as good as I remembered, but a good, tough, mean Western","Saw this as a kid, and was a bit disappointed when I watched the DVD tonight. Edward Dmytryk's direction is a bit slow at times, although the three lead actors bring great authority to their roles, and Quinn in particular has a great time as the creepy (and possibly gay-fixated) right hand to Fonda. The script has lots of shooting and killing, but it seems to be over at least 30 minutes before it actually is, and the many shootouts become repetitious. The female leads bring little to the film; Dorothy Malone pouts and postures, and Dolores Michaels was a fairly colorless ingenue.Still, the film has its place as a more adult Western than many others, and can be recommended. The quality of the DVD is variable. The widescreen Cinemascope process is well captured, but the colors are often pale and washed out. And speaking of pale, why would Fox show a trailer of the Technicolor DRUMS ALONG THE MOHAWK in black and white?"
5,One of the ten best westerns ever,"A great, atmospheric film having major western stars in their best form. Everything seems to be clicking just right. In my opinion it is better than Nigh Noon or Red River. Enjoy it!"
5,Very nicely done,"Warner Bros. should be proud of this product. Everything from the packaging to the great looking episodes themselves. Its very nicely done!! And, NO...I don't work for Warner Bros. As a long time Duke's fan, I've always felt that the 2nd Season was the best season overall. Its really great to see them all un-edited also. The most popular season of the Dukes is Season 3, with the ""Carnival of Thrills"", with a little luck, Warner Bros. will make that DVD later this year. Maybe for that DVD, the cast can be re-united again to talk about episodes from all of the released DVD's. Its always interesting to hear about memories from certain episodes from the cast! The Dukes 2nd Season DVD is excellent! Thanks."
5,The dukes of hazard 2nd season,This product is really good fun to watch!Just like all the other hazard box sets!
3,Decent choice,"I liked it. My teacher suggested it and while it's a bit expensive it has a great variety of songs and is very readable. IMO they need to put these things in spiral bindings so you can actually make photocopies, but that's just my pirating opinion. ;)"
2,not for the general audience,"I love tea. I have at least 10 different types of tea at home at any time. I rarely try a tea I don't like. But this one (Russian Caravan) defies all rules - it's so strong (not as in ""strong tea"" but as in ""strong flavor""), it's impossible to drink without some preparation. One friend of mine calls it ""camel feet"" tea, and I'm afraid in this case, I have to agree."
4,Excellent Tex-Mex from Sir Doug!,"Recorded for the Austin City Limits televion show in 1981, this CD is an expanded edition of that show. Doug Sahm is joined by Augie Myers and original Quintet drummer John Perez, along with son Shawn Sahm on rhytm guitar, Speedy Sparks on bass, and Alvin Crow on guitar. This is just a fantastic CD for several reasons. For one thing, there aren't many available live releases by Doug Sahm or the Sir Douglas Quintet and this fills that void; they play the hits and more - including material from the out-of-print album ""Border Wave,"" and this CD sounds fantastic! Doug and Augie and the rest of the band sound great and the tune selection from early hits ""She's About a Mover"" and Mendocino"" to later songs like ""San Antone"" and ""It Was Fun While It Lasted"" is wonderful. It's not a reissue, so I don't know what to call it, but if you're a fan of roots rock and/or Doug Sahm you should get it. Let's hope more great music will come from the Austin City Limits vaults."
3,So what if he wrote The Wire,"He think he got to talk like this to represent what black folks talk like, but he really be sounding ign'ant. It distracts from an already leisurely paced story. It's just an ok read: a couple of good parts drowning in corny dialog. Then again, maybe if you're not black (or from the 'hood) it wont sound so cheesy to you."
4,Tristar canister bag,These little canister bags do their job and fit into my Tristar Canister. They are a little hard to find locally since Tristar isn't Hoover or Eureka in popularity. I will buy these again.
3,Valuie and appearance,This watch has a much more expensive appearance than many at $100 and has durability as well as accuracy. It is an exellent buy for me.
4,Great watch for the price,Bought two watches for my 17yr and 16yr old sons. They love the way they look and so far no complaints. Great watches at a great price.
4,good solid case for smaller guitar,I got this for the my kid's guitar because the local retailer didn't have it. It shipped quickly and well packaged. It fits the guitar perfectly and is more solidly built than I had expected. For the price its great.
1,I have to fix this Average,"OK first off I have not read the book. I have seen the movie and skimed the book. I will never read the book just as I will never read any of the ""Sweet Vally High"" series. I would loose several hours of my life forever and never get that time back. I have to write this review to warn people who might otherwise be drawn in. Won't just take my word for it? Good for you. Here are just a few of many reasons to dislike this story. 1) Bad Plot - I won't spoil it just suffice to say its weak and poorly thrown together. 2) Bad Characters - While not as bad as the plot the characters are still very poorly thought out. 3) And to top it off the theme is bad - Yes I know how can the theme truly be evaluated? The answer is that this theme certanly can. In conclusion, I love D&D and I love fantasy movies. So I went into this with the highest hopes and this story fails utterly. Buyer beware. PS - if you liked the movie you will actually like the book."
4,German Drinking and Beer Garden Songs,The CD was delivered in very good condition but the delivery took longer than what was promised.
5,Does what it says,"It is a good battery, color does not exactly match with the rest of the body though. Seems to work ok."
3,Replacement Battery,"This battery worked great for the first few months, but then started losing capacity just like the original battery, even faster."
3,"lasted about a year, but so did the Apple battery","This battery lasted about 10 months before holding only a 20-30 minute charge-- but so did the last Apple battery that I bought. This knockoff started out with a 6-7 hour charge, and kept that up for several months, before dropping to 2-3 hours, and then finally a half hour. I'm going to take another chance, and order another one of these. The price is right for a battery that doesn't last very long. The fit was not perfect, but after I got it in, I hardly noticed that. I'm giving it a 3, but, on the other hand, I'd give Apple's battery a two...."
2,iBook battery review,"I purchased this battery as a replacement for my iBook G4, thinking that I would see the kind of battery life I saw with the original -- that is not the case. The original would give at least 3.5 hours of run time (more depending on the programs running). This one, however, will barely carry the computer for 2 hours. I only paid around $50 - so maybe it's true that you get what you pay for. Next time, I'll opt for buying directly from Apple."
1,disappointing battery life,"Needed another replacement battery for my aging iBook G4 and took a chance, as the price was definitely right. However, the lifespan of this battery has left a lot to be desired. Within the first two months, the battery was fine, but it just never seemed to work correctly - the charging indicator would always indicate ""charging"" even afer I knew the battery should have been fully charged. By 6 months out, the battery would only hold a charge for about 20 minutes. By now - less than one year - the battery holds about a 9 minute charge and gives no warning at all before just dying out. The Mac is still a good machine and I will need yet another battery, but I can't say it will be one of these Tech Orbit batteries."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BATTERY!!,"I've had this battery for only about 4 months, and it is no longer charging properly. The battery has been overheating, and my computer might be damaged because of it. These battery is not the same quality as original equipment battery."
1,Don't buy this item!,"I bought this product and it didn't even last a day. It came with a 50% charge, and when that ran out it wouldn't charge again. Had to send it back the next day for a refund."
3,Poor Battery LIfe,Slightly disappointed with the low battery life. Computer dies after 40-50% of the charge has been discharged (~1.5hrs) on low energy settings.
5,"Baja, the best side of Mexico","Reveles captures the sounds, smells and flavor of the small town of Tecate as only a lover of Baja can. Has you longing to visit the setting. Love all of his books.Maureen and Danny Motola, authors of Alfonsina a Baja Legend, Murder on the Sea of Cortez, Murder in the Mountains"
1,Don't get lulled into a false sense of security with Maxtor drives,I have a 160GB Maxtor one-touch firewire drive which was working perfectly but has just suddenly died after 14 months. Maxtor's response is that there is nothing they can do.I also have a newer 300GB Maxtor One-touch II usb/firewire drive on another machine. The software drivers for this in Windows XP have a bug which crashes my PC on a frequent basis.The drives are very stylish but don't get lulled into a false sense of security by their sleek design and ease of use. The drives may let you down.
2,Included software is not up to par,"I've had this product for 6 months now, and even though I consider myself somewhat tech savvy, I still haven't been able to figure out the included Retrospect software, required to use the one-touch back-up functionality. The software is incredibly un-friendly, and the manual is equally cryptic. I'm sure that it's easy to use for programmers and such, but definitively not for the average user.Because of this shortcoming I'm using the hard drive as a regular drive, just copying my files manually. I'd recommend buying a similar product with better software."
4,A Very Good Read,"This is a very good book as far as reading goes. You could also learn a few things in the process. There are many ""how-to"" books out there and a true adventure-fishing story can be a refreshing change. So if you are interested in good, entertaining real life fishing stories or accounts, pick this book up.It is an amazing insight into the days gone by, the abundance of fish and how close to shore they could be caught.I could not help but notice certain pent up anger and arrogance in the text directed at other pioneering anglers that I felt was unjustified, unfair and may be even incorrect. If this book is not a tribute to pioneering big-game anglers it certainly a tribute to Zane Grey himself. But all in all it was a bloody good read."
5,Great Book,if you loved the movie you will love this book! its very detailed and i couldn't put it down
4,page-turner!,"I read this book in 2 days, and immediately purchased the sequel. Great entertainment, with enough morality to make you think (just a little!). The science is engrossing and there are enough surprises and suspenseful moments to keep you reading this straight through! This is a great book for a quiet weekend."
5,Soul Tracker finds the heart of outreach,"This book escorted me out of my comfort zones in a stolen car- straight to the heart of Christ's love. Not only did I take a refreshed look at my own rigid set of rules, a desire grew with each paragraph to pad down to the nearest inner city shelter and make some new friends, put my life to greater purpose.Myers descriptions of ""life after"" are the most comprehensive ideas I have ever entertained. Hell made more sense as described in Myer's voice, while Heaven became a much more anticipated, longed for destination.Myers has a new fan, and I expect that feeling to grow ever loyal as I delve into his other works and look forward to Soul Tracker's sequel The Presence~KB"
4,Great Music in the Spirit of Oktoberfest,"As manager of ""The Oktoberfest Webring,"" I am always on the lookout for CD's of good Oktoberfest music. In this particular CD, all of the songs are played by the German Air Force Band and are taken from another CD entitled, ""More German Military Marches & Polkas - Vol. II."" As you might expect, most of the selections are not--strictly speaking--Oktoberfest numbers. However, they are played and sung in the light-hearted, breezy manner typical of Oktoberfest. In addition, the band and singers give top-notch performances. So, as a CD of Oktoberfest-like music, I give this product high marks. It would probably make great background music for any Oktoberfest."
4,Great for the imagination,This paint kit has provided a great outlet for my child to use his imagination. He loves all the different color paints and different shaped sponges. The best part for him is squishing the bottled paints between his fingers. The best part for me is that all the paints wash off easily with water.
1,Completely Different Color,"The set arrived only 2 days after I ordered. The quality of the set is quite good. However, the color of the comforter is completely different with the color in the picture you see on the web. The feature color is coffee-ish, and the so-called gold trim color is actually soil like. Also, I ordered the King size, but the queue size was shipped. Returned the set."
5,BORGIAS IS BRILLIANT!!!!,"I LOVE IT... I LOVE HISTORICAL DRAMAS. SCANDELS,SEXY,POSION,INCEST,BETRAYL...ALL IN THE FIRST SEASON. I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL NEXT SEASON. I HOPE THIS SHOW WAS PICKED UP"
4,Can not wait to see this!,"I saw the trailer for this about a year ago, when I was watching a episode of TUDORS. I was instantly excited to see this. Since we do not have the channel it comes on, i have had this on hold at my library. I will have season 1in jan. 2012."
4,Beautifully done,I am looking forward to the second season. I am very happy that it follows history so well.The sets and costumes are wonderful.
2,"Indeed, Boring!","The death of any action film is excessive dialog. And this series has that excess to excess.It is a real shame, based upon the history of the Borgias, that the screenwriters could not fit the script to the historical facts. Instead, there is endless chit-chat (especially between the Pope & his mistress) that leads no where, and does not push the plot down the road. The Borgias lived in exciting times, none of which is maximized in this script. And the terrible casting: Check Savanarola (Steven Berkoff). He is fat! And no hooked nose! He looks more like Martin Luther or Friar Tuck.The best that can be said of the script is the interplay between Cesare (Francois Arnaud) and his sister Lucrezia (Holliday Grainger). Not only do they both look like their historical characters, but the love they have for each other is superbly filmed, not with words, but the way they look at each other and hold each other. This warrants two stars."
4,See below,"The acting was wonderful, the production also.. But the story is not accurate historically .:examples: As far as I know,The pope, Alexander VI didn't die of poisoning but of malaria. Lucretia Borgia did not have a son from the horseman of her first husband, Lucretia Borgia and Giulia were captured by the French army, and did not lead the French army voluntarily, but they released them for a ransom."
3,Cuts,"Clearly, you can see that the series were edit. Some situations that you see in the previous of a episode, never happenned in the anterior. So sad. Be honest."
2,Predictable soap opera with poor dialogue,"The worst thing was the audio. In low registers voices were difficult to understand and somewhat 'gutteral"" in tone, especially Jeremy Irons. English subtitles are much needed to help the viewer understand the dialogue. Disappointed overall."
3,Borgias,Who are these people? Characters come and go having you try to figure out who are they portraying.Sub-titles in other period pieces identifying the new characters made it much more easy to follow. I kept waitng for the daytime scenes to be refreshed from the dark and dreary night dialogue. This production does not come close to what was done in the Rome or Tudor series. I will pass on season 2.
3,It was alright,"Quite boring that I went to sleep 20 minuets in.So sad, cause I loved reading about the Borgiashow corrupt and used the church for their own gain.But this was kinda boring.Sorry"
1,Starts slow and doesn't pick up.,This show caused me to fall asleep way to early because this did not keep me entertained. Will not be watching the rest of the season.
1,Terrible TOY...,This is the biggest pain ever! It is not for an 8 year old for sure! It is nearly impossible to get the beads started. Directions are terrible. I think if the string was thicker it would work better. It is a piece of junk!
2,Don't waste your time,"A great idea, in theory, but I think this is a very poor design. The wing nuts do not tighten sufficiently to hold the strings in place - they just spin around and around. I will be able to get it working, with a bit of work and a few bits and pieces from around the house, but if I had given this to a child for Christmas I would feel awful about it..."
3,requires patience and persistance,"I bought this for my 8 year old grand-daughter but ended up giving it to the 14 year old and was GLAD I did. Would have been much too hard for the younger girl. Required my assistance even though the 14 year old is highly capable. She did really enjoy it, though, which I wasn't sure she would -- was not too juvenile for her."
5,Beautiful Book,"I had been searching high and low for a copy of this book and was so happy to finally find it on Amazon Marketplace! It is a very sweet and very real portrayal of the courtship and correspondence between Dietrich Bonhoeffer and his fiance Maria Von Wedemeyer during the frightening and uncertain events of WWII and Nazi Germany. Beautiful and poignant, it is well worth reading for anyone inspired by Bonhoeffer and his work."
3,"Good, but a typical sequel","I thought the first book ""Darkwalker on Moonshae"" was much better. Although the author brings back the main characters, and even adds a few more, we are still left with what I feel was a rather lame ending to another large battle. Overall, I have started the third book, ""Darkwell"" and the storyline with all three is still very good. It's an older series, but I read Darkwalker when I was in H.S (almost 15 years ago) and didnt even realize there were sequels. Still an enjoyable set."
3,"MOST of the music's gone, BUT...","...but the show's still a gem. good transfer, clear picture, decent interview extras, nice set. a great cast working from clever scripting that was far more adult than i remembered (my favorite has to be the 60s-era teacher who has to keep cutting off his reminiscences about drugs before the kids get wise to him). the missing songs did diminish the nostalgic rush of seeing these episodes again after 25 or so years - i missed the reruns on nick at nite - though i wonder if the missing music will really make a difference to anyone who doesn't have prior knowledge of the show. still, i would've given five stars if the soundtrack was intact."
1,good but....,"I was looking for dry soft washcloths. This item is nearly as good as I expected. But, the washcloth's texture is a bit rough and too thick, does not have the softness I was looking for. What I DID NOT like about is the handling of the product. I ordered 15 packs, 3 packs of my order were previously open, thus, I cannot use for fear of product contamination. Since the product costs less than $4 per pack, it makes no economic sense to return. I will not purchase from this merchant again."
3,"Good for water resistance, Poor for UV","We printed a large banner on vinyl for outdoor display, and gave it a heavy coating of the Krylon 1305 UV Clear. I used nearly two cans on a banner about 42 inches by 8 feet. It was mounted facing south inside a solid frame. It went up on Monday and stayed looking good for about 2 days. But by day 4 the magenta ink had faded almost completely except where a small shadow was cast at the very top by the frame. This left the greens a pale sea foam and worse, skin tones were now greenish and pale. None of the ink ran despite a heavy rain. It only took one sunny day (the third day) to fade the magenta tones all out, despite the heavy coating (four coats over the face of my subject!). So, waterproof? Yes. Fade resistant, not at all. We got the exact same result on an untreated banner as far as fading went."
2,The Editors should be ashamed,"While this book has mostly accurate information, the presentation and editing is absolutely horrible. I have never seen so many grammar and spelling mistakes in a technical reference nor have I ever seen such bad presentation. Many of the review and assessment questions were badly worded, and the editors made the mistake of placing the wrong answer key with several groups of questions. This is unacceptable in a certification training manual and especially one of this price. For clarity and ease of understanding anyone wanting to learn Citrix Metaframe 1.8 is much better off going with the Exam Cram on the subject. This book breaks a great rule of technology workers. Technical mastery doesn't mean anything if you can't communicate effectively."
1,Babyscapes still in their infancy,"From the initial notes of the first track this CD never really lifts itself out of the Kate Bushesque blue funk that it so it so wantonly tries to emulate. If you want your offspring to be unimaginative and lacking in creative ability, then this is for you. However, if you want a bit more wild in your child I suggest you try the Presuming Ed CD ""Safe in Sound"". A far more satisfying experience."
4,Epakitin 300 gm,My vet prescribed this supplement for my 13 year old cat with renal failure. It is easy to administer as it dissolves readily in liquid and my cat likes it. So far so good. I buy the largest quantity as it lasts a long time and I don't need to keep reordering. It is also more economical.
1,Don't Waster Your Money,The length was to short. It will not reach to the back of the trunk. I'm not going to throw it out my window and on top of the roof becaus then you can not close the window.. Waste of money. Poor design.
4,works fine.,"Not much to say other than works fine and is cheaper than the HP product. Been buying these for a couple of years, no complaints."
1,no good,HP28 ink cartridge that I bought in accordance with your specification was not compatible with my HP Officejet 5610.Borpik
2,Where's The Ink?,"I purchased this in mid February and it's done as of mid April. That might actually not be a bad thing if I printed a lot of stuff, but I don't. You get what you pay for; a little money equals a little ink."
3,To similiar too....,"If you read ""The Perfect Husband"" by Lisa Gardner then you will be disappointed in this book, at least I was. It was a great story, the author did a good job but as I read the story I kept thinking ""Ive read this already""? Karen Rose tells a great story, I would read her next book, hopefully it wont resemble someone elses story so much.If you havent read ""The Perfect Husband"" the Im sure you'll love this book."
5,Excellent Story!,"I love romantic suspense, and Ms. Rose is a great story teller. She weaves the suspense in beautifully with the love story, making it flow without focusing too much on one or the other. I was duly impressed and plan on reading more from this author. Her characters are well-defined and well-rounded, and her bad guys are not too over the top. All her characters seem human and easy to relate to, which I like the best. It flowed well and had a quick pace that made it an easy read, and I enjoyed every minute of it!"
4,Great page turner!,I really enjoyed this book. Very suspenseful. Well developed characters and the important part is that it delivers a message to all abused women letting them know that it is possible to find a new life. My only criticism: The story line and the intensity of the story are so good that there is really no need for the explicit sex.
3,Predictable,"I have read and enjoyed other Karen Rose books but this one was not up there. The book is well written so 3 stars is justified, even though I am soely tempted to score it less. The plot is too predictable, the result and path inevitable and well trodden. The abuse theme can be harrowing, such extreme violence against women and children. Mary Grace's story has been told before in many forms. So I do not recommend this - the story is not original and fails to build tension. The romance is also too predictable, both damaged, falling into each other's arms, etc. It did not spark for me.There are better Karen Rose books out there - don't let this be your first."
4,My first book by this author,"I enjoyed this kindle book very much. I've had it for some time on my kindle and just had not gotten around to reading it, but am glad I finally did and I will be reading more by Karen Rose. Her style of writing is very easy to read and her story line kept me wanting to know what happens next."
1,A huge letdown,"The game is full of bugs and little/no communication is being given from SOE as to the status of fixes.The quests in the game only take you to level 30 and there are 90 levels. So after achieving level 30 get ready for a long, tedious grind.Normal items do not decay and all have pretty much similar stats so there is not much diversity in the way of crafters.My advice is to save your money and buy WoW instead."
1,It was the best when it first started...,"This game went from one of the best games that i have ever played, to the worst game i have ever played. Sony has the worst customer service anyone has ever seen. They treat their customers like pieces of dog poo. Don't let them abuse you, avoid this game like you avoid your ex girlfriend!"
1,"Galaxies is dieing, and they are needing last minute money","Like the title states. They have revamped this game from the beginning soo many times that they have finally drove it into the ground. This last change that SWG implimented was the final blow. The fun factor and everything I love about Star Wars is sadly over. I'm not sure why they would ""fix"" something that wasn't broken, unless to force people to quit for other business ventures. To offer a ""starter kit"" for new players is a ploy to squeeze every dollar out of the consumer, before the game is axed. SOE should be wearing ski masks. Save yourself some money and skip this failure."
1,SOE is a rip off.,SWG use to be the best mmorpg on the market and very unique. Today it is a dumbed down version of itself. If you are interested in SWG go buy Jedi Academy. The game play is exactly the same and it is not $15 a month.
1,You gave the game to Sony!!?? HA HA HA HA!!!,"An online game set in the Star Wars universe was a FANTASTIC idea and one destined to become an icon in the gaming world. The only thing that could have stopped this game being the biggest in existence was to involve Sony Online Entertainment...er...oops, guess that's why this game has empty servers. Guess that's why people joke about how bad this game is. Guess that's why Star Wars Galaxies has become a symbol of ""what not to do"" with an online game. Guess Lucas Arts is now paying for that decision!Yeah, give your game to a company (Sony Online Entertainment) with the worse rep in the gaming community, the poorest customer service and the most moronic chimps in their tech department. Give your game to a company that is renown for treating its paying customers like dirt and lying to the community to cover its fraudulent behaviour.Well done Lucas Arts! Good choice!"
1,Game Over,"Everything and anything that once was fun is now gone. The dynamic crafting system is now pointless, no way to level up past 30, and there are quests filled with bugs. Until SOE pulls there act together I strongly sugest to stay away. Servers are on ""light"" status something which was only reserved for the smallest servers. Just simply not worth it anymore."
1,Please please please spend your cash on something else,This game had its share of problems before but it was still fun. The new changes that they have made render it unplayable and dull dull dull.The promise of being able to start off as a Jedi is meant to lure new players to the game but Jedi in the game now is so weak that any new player will feel conned that they have paid for this game and at least a months subscription.If you really want to play this game then at least try the free ten day trial that you can download. Just bear in mind that this trial is designed to appeal to new players so ignore all of the characters from the movies in it as they hardly appear in the actual proper game at all. Just look at the game play and then go and try a game that is worth the time money and effort instead.
1,Take your money elsewhere! I would not waste time on a free copy!,"This game is the worst combination of First Person Shooter and RPG I have ever seen. The controls are clunky and the game play is horribly boring. This game requires a $15 a month fee. For that you will get the beta version of this game, It is incomplete and riddled with bugs. You will play for hours to find out that the quest you should have completed is bugged and lose your rewards as well as your time. SOE also has the worst customer service you can encounter. PLayers bring up the issues and bugs and the company just takes your money and ignores the players. AVOID THIS GAME! Be careful when purchasing an SOE game."
1,Absolutely horrible,"Stay clear of this train wreck of a game. It began good, if the developers had only tweaked the original settings a little it would be fantastic.. but no.. they changed the entire concept and now it's almost unplayable.The worst Star Wars game I have ever played since the ""upgrade""."
4,Más o menos,"No es tan feo como dicen, es mas, llega a divertir con el paso del tiempo.Como recomendación, bajen el demo antes y lo prueban."
4,"That'll Do Donkey, That'll Do!","I'm a big Star Wars fan and a big video game player (MMO especially). This game, unfortunetly, is outdated by its graphics, etc. The official service from Sony is NOT worth $15/mth - I had a much better time playing World of Warcraft and Guild Wars. With all the bad things I'm saying about it, it's the only Star Wars fix out there, with real people. So; for what it's worth - it's a decent game. I'm really waiting for Old Republic to release. I believe everyone will drop this game for that one."
1,So Much Potential. Check back in 6 months,"From the onset this game looks to be a blast! NPC interraction, fun starter quest to help learn controls etc. After playing for about 2 days the occasional bugs progress into show-stoppers.There is much potential here, but this is nowhere near a finished product. Wait 6 months and check back. Do NOT buy this game in its current state."
1,Sinking Ship,"I've been playing an entertainer as long as I have been playing this game (since Sept '04) and it seems like devs constantly ask for your opinions, then give you either the opposite of what you asked for or some perverted, skewed version. Instead of the wonderful diversity that once was SWG, we now have a clone of EVERY OTHER MMORPG on the market. Save your money, spend it on an MMORPG that's not a sinking ship."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"Imagine, playing this game for nearly a year, putting in 5 hours a day, building your character, buying all the best weapons, armor, etc., to have it all mean nothing over night.It was a great game, until they revamped the entire game and took away years of hardwork of thousands of gamers.They lie to the community and they break promises. They make promises that they know they will never follow through on, and they do it outright, its almost hilarious to witness.They released a new expanions then told everyone only days later that they were revamping the game (which they new the whole time) makeing many items in the expansion worthless. It was so bad they had to start offering refunds.Put 2 and 2 together, I need not say anything more."
4,I'm such a dork,"I bought this kit JUST to get the instant travel vehicle. Been playing it over 3 years... I guess with anything, it gets old after a while. A new player would have fun with this for many months. I suppose, played in moderation, this game would be fun forever. Good graphics and nearly endless amount of things to do."
1,Not fun for more than an hour,"I bought this game, and it was only fun for the first hour, after that the FPS-based interface got anoying, the lack of fun in the game made it all worse...It's grind grind grind grind, and nothing to show for it.Theres 95% Jedi's running around, Jedi's unlike those in movies:1. They run around stormtroopers showing lightsabers2. There are 95% of them around3. Bounty Hunters cant hunt player-jedi's anymore..As you can see, this is NOTHING like the movies anymore.."
1,A Bad Purchase,You will read a lot of bad reviews about this game and how after 15 November 2005 they changed Star Wars Galaxies into it's current incarnation. This change ruined a great game. Sure it had problems but it was a great game.As a new potential customer you aren't interested in what it used to be like though. You are interested in whether you would like this product as it is now. The game as it is might entertain you and you might like it. However you are required to enter a contract with SOE and just looking at the other reviews you will see just how poorly we all feel we have been treated by this company. I would not advise anybody buys this product or has any dealings with SOE. They will just take your money and not give a damn about you.
1,Ruined by Development,"For 1.5 years this was an OK Game that needed some touchup... Then, over the past year, Developers have ruined everything that made it special.Now, until they roll back this is an embarassment"
1,SOE have ruined this game,"SOE have completely changed the game play with the NGE, utterly ruining it in my opinion. Beyond that, with these changes long term players have been completely disregarded, many of whom losing items/skills which took a great deal of time and effort to aquire.It's not worth giving them your money, particularly in light of the current understanding that SWG will be closed down within 10 months due to a mass exodus of subscribers."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Complete, utter, nonsense. Everything that was fun and wonderful about the game has been smashed into pieces by not one, but two curbs... The New Game Enhancements system do the exact opposite of their intended purpose, instead of fixing the existing bugs, and changing the format into a more user-friendly mode, the NGE system is full of downfalls and frustrating elements. Don't waste your money on this, check out the SOE SWG forums for yourself for proof. BTW, I'm not some noob kid, I'm 30, and I've played this game for over two years. Cancelled 2 accounts last week."
1,not recommended,"I tried SWG figuring that a taste of Starwars might really be fun. The major problem with this game is the whole engine is just a rip off of World of Warcraft. World of Warcraft has far better graphics, content, and balance. Both of these games cost the same each month, so you might as well just pick the better game. I read some good reviews on this game and I honestly don't know what those people were talking about. There are less than 200K people playing SWG now, and over 5 million people playing WoW. Like I said, stick to WoW."
1,Unfinished beta version,"Bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs. Unusable interface. I was a long time vet player who mainly crafted droids and starships for other players. Now this new version of the game forces me to trash all the time invested in one of my professions. The developers consider the crafters less than an afterthought, not even providing a guide on their website as they did for the other professions.Do not buy this game!! There are many other games out there that provide a satisfying Star Wars experience."
3,Works Okay,Fits well but it slides on the arm and I usually have to roll it back into place after it is fitted.
5,Understanding the Truth of God as Beyond Logic,"In this little book, A.W. Tozer takes us on a journey to the center of the Heart of God as he illustrates the ""Divine Conquest of the Human Heart"". Without mincing any words, Tozer makes it clear that the reality and the essence of God, are beyond the scope of human logic and understanding. The simple yet profound fact of God, as we see so clearly in Tozer's words, is that truth is a deep, personal, spiritual experience given to each of us by God alone, through His Son, Jesus Christ. You will come away from this book with a sense of awe and humility as you explore the depths of your soul and pear with open eyes into the face of the Saviour."
5,Pursuit of Man - devinely inspired,"A signpost pointing in the direction of the narrow path that is travelled by so few. If I were to give this book another title, it would be called ""True Christianity"".This book has most certainly changed my life. A must read for all who call themselves by the name Christian, who desire more than anything to walk upon that narrow path.If I could suggest two books essential to the Christian faith, they would undoubtably be the Bible and Pursuit of Man."
1,Big disappointment if you want to learn to speak Mandarin,"These flash cards are designed for learning to write chinese characters, not for those who want to learn to speak Mandarin. I guess the product title told that, but they could have given them a dual usage with a better design. It's a pity, it's such a large set. They'd only have had to select a signle romanized pronunciation representation and put it in the lower right corner, with a single english translation somewhere on the other side, and they have have been used for speed memorization."
4,Excellent Cards. Package could be made better,"I am using Conversational Chinese 301 (ISBN 7561906560) as my study text, and the flashcards are a welcome addition.Pros:I can use the 10-page alphabetical index to search for characters/cards that I may have forgotten or confused.The alphabetical index and the card with the card number, come in handy when mastering the characters for a word with four tones.Cons:I wish that the cards were more portable - it is not very easy to carry these around especially when one is on the move. It would be really nice if they came in a file.The cards have been stacked horizontally making it very difficult to access cards at the bottom of the stack. Vertical stacking would make it easier to access."
2,Not as nice as pictured,The bed pan that I got was somewhat different from the one shown in the ad. This one is made very thick plastic and would never need to be replace. The reason I gave it only 2 stars is because it has sharp edges on the front and it could cut you. The thing to do before using it would be to smooth down the sharp edges and it would be a 5 star bed pan. That's my thought about it. And I am the one using it because I am bed bound.
2,It doesn't worth the money at all,"I spent 17 bucks to buy the skillet. Obviously, the price is good for 80% off. However, when I cooked, all the things sticked to it. I don't suggest to buy this no matter how cheap it is. The reason why I gave 2 stars is because the skillet is pretty solid, which seems able to be used lifetime."
2,Not what I thought it would be.,"I thought I would like this piece but it really only works for sauces, rice, and pasta. I burned something in it and I have a brown sticky spot on the bottom of the inside of the pan that I cannot remove with Calphalon's recommended cleaners. Now every time I use this something sticks. I would recommend sticking with the commercial nonstick and not the hard anodized pieces."
5,Best Deal Offered,"High quality merchandise,with excellent service and a very good price. We are pleased to add this cookware to our kitchen collection."
2,not so good,I thought it would be not stick when I cook. But it is still stick and after washing it left a very big white spot. I would not recommended to anyone.
2,Not very good at all!,This skillet was a huge disappointment. Foods stick to the rough surface even with no-stick spray.
4,Nice wide base makes it less likely to tip over.,I got this rack after reviewing a whole bunch of others because it was 1) a standard rack without a bunch of separate pieces to clean and assemble/dis-assemble 2) had a wide base. It is a winner on both counts. The most important being that the base stand 'legs' is/are wide enough so it is not tipping and falling over hot in the oven. Very good rack. I have not used it enough to say if any coating comes off or not with usage.
5,tissues,"I love these Tempo tissues. They are really worth the price. Usually with regular tissues from Kleenex or Puffs, they tear or are very thin and you must use two to do the job! These are very strong . I love them!"
2,a very terrible disc,"If you think Mr. Rod Stewart messed up ""Downtown Train"" and ""Hang On, St. Christopher"", the terrible covers in this collection should make Old Rod look like a talented prince. In this terrible anti-tribute, classic songs from Waits' early career are mocked and destroyed. The songs are covered without sincerity and in many cases, without any talents. If you're looking for covers of Tom Waits songs, may I suggest Temptations by Holly Cole or the 2000 tribute called New Coat of Paint. In these tributes, musicians such as Neko Case(an exceptionally good cover of ""Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis""), Carla Bozulich, Floyd Dixon, Eleni Mandell and Holly Cole not only gave a new spin to Waits' songs, in many cases, they gave a whole new dimension to the familiar tunes. As for ""Step Right Up"", plainly put, it sucks."
3,"Good Storyline, Bad Story","While I really enjoyed the storyline of this book and thought it was well-written, I can't give it more than three stars.Steven was unbearable with his jealousy and it really turned me off from his character. Jenna was too perfect, but she was more tolerable than Steven. The murderer's identity also couldn't have been more obvious.But, there's no way I can give anymore stars to a book that features so much violence against animals. If one more dog had been stabbed, I would've been done with this author forever."
4,"Good, sexy, vulnerable hero. Heroine was likeable also.","Good, exciting book. Great suspense, great sex. I'm pretty picky about writing style, and I like Karen Rose. Intelligent, witty, semi-unpredictable. . . what more can you ask for in a suspense, thriller, chick book? (chick book yes, but my husband liked it, too). After I read this book, which I purchased after I read the other Amazon reviewers' critiques, I went out and bought all of her other books. And I have to say, I'd highly recommend them also. Actually, they were so good that I spent most of my kids' winter break reading them instead of spending quality time with my children. Now I need peruse the Amazon ""self-help"" book department and find one on how to deal with guilt."
5,Have to read this book!,Great book! From the 1st page down to the last page. You get concerned for the characters and their situations. I finished this book less than a day and a half. Didn't want to put it down. Great mystery/romance thriller.
3,Cute blocks but...,"When we received these blocks, my 10 month old son and I loved them. My son would check out all the blocks, liked to tip the box and make the blocks spill out, and enjoyed knocking them down when I would stack them up. Unfortunately after about a day, the paint started to chip. By about a week, most of the blocks had some paint the chipped off. I was so disappointed that I decided to return them. Thankfully, Amazon's customer service was wonderful!"
2,Parallel Elements End in Dissatisfaction,"The writing style is very good....keeps you interested...but the parallel plot elements within the story end up confusing and unsatisfying at the story's end. What about the wrestler dude.?...we're left hanging! It's almost like the author was going to write a sequel. Also, the main character, Seeger King, having metaphysical visions seems out of sync with the story line. I encourage the author to write a sequel....tie up loose ends...and bring it to a tighter conclusion. (It's almost like the author ran-out-of-gas towards the end of the book)"
3,Anguished Adolescent Angst,"A well written novel focusing on the summer of 1987 in the life of a graduating gay/bi high schooler. The book is a short 210 pages which enabled me to complete it in one afternoon. A diverse cast of characters (mainly six) but only Seegar King (the princple character) is fully developed. The other characters: Seegar's mother, father, step-mother, two girl friends and boy classmate-love interest are not well developed. The frequent references to Marc Almond song titles put Seegar's life in a strange perspective that made it clear that this story was intended for a young audience. The few sexual scenes are quite tame, brief and apparently unsatisfying for the participants and reader as well. I am passing the book along to Texas friends who may appreciate the references to areas of their state."
1,Compatible HP Ink Cartridge,This is a very low quality printer cartridge. It is especially bad when printing small characters.
2,adequate at best,"Bought this for an Amigo 3/4 size guitar I bought for my 7yo daughter. The size is right, as it should be, but the case is of pretty poor quality. It is more flimsy than other chipboard cases I have seen and the buckles don't line up properly. You sort of have to bend the lid over to get the buckle to insert into the receptor end. No problem for me but a big problem for my daughter. Little padding and very cheap looking on the interior. Granted you don't have much choice for a 3/4 size guitar and I suppose its adequate to protect the guitar but I'm not exactly impressed."
2,"Vocals Hurt ""All Aboard""","Indigo Swing's ""All Aboard"" (as well as their first self-titled cd) has a solid sound instrumentally, but lacks significantly in the vocal department. Johnny Boyd's voice is better suited for light bubble gum pop than the gritty, soulful, post-war era jump-blues and boogie-woogie style the band aspires to. I could see giving this cd a higher rating were it not for the distraction of his thin, high-pitched vocals. To someone looking to purchase this cd, I would have to recommend holding off until it hits the sale bin."
5,Never Stops Amazing,"I bought this album the day it came out, way back in July. Man, I have never met an album quite like it, with the exception of the old great, Louis Jordan. From the beginning, it grabs you and doesn't let you go. This is a must buy for any swing fan ever. Plus, the live show is amazing, I should know, I've seen them live 4 times, here at the Crystal Ballroom. Anyway, if you are reading this, you better be buying the album."
3,A Hero's Tale,"The Spyro series has headed downhill, but this game did try to pick it back up. Like Enter the Dragonfly, it's another one of those games you just pick up and play."
4,not very good warming mittens,"I got them as a gift for my mom for her birthday and of course, after she had opened them she wanted to try them out because she is super cold 24/7. she wears like 3 shirts,long underwear,pants,and 2 pairs of socks in 75-80degree weather and is STILL cold. After I had heated them up in the microwave for her as the directions stated, I felt them and they weren't very warm and I went up to 1 minute and 30seconds which was the most you are supposed to do...so I don't know. She said she liked them but that could have been her just trying to be nice and not make me feel like I had purchased a bad gift or it might not have been, I'll never be sure. The mittens are really thick and bulky so you can't really change the channel on the TV or cook or whatever."
2,Not Heat Up & Cannot Do Anything with them on,I bought these for my girlfriend & they did not heat up well & they did not fit & she could not do anything with her hands while she was wearing them. I had to return them.
2,Fire Star is a darker tale,"Unlike the previous books in the series, Fire Star turns dark and deals with troubling issues including: torture, characters possessed by an evil alien (really), murder, and odd spiritual beliefs.I'd recommend for parents to read this book first as the plot takes these darker turns after a dull section at about page 422. My 10-year-old, who loved the first two books, lost interest during the dull part and I will not be encouraging him to finish this book."
4,"Move over Tarzan, Shanna's got more of everything.",Frank Cho's artistry is top notch. He breaks the trendy mold on how to draw the female form in action in today's comics and graphic novels. The story is far fetched but Jurassic park made money for a reason.
3,"Interesting story, poorly written.","This autobiography of Robert Mondavi is engaging and a good read for anyone interested in the story of California wine. The downside is that he is probably the only person who could overemphasize his contribution to the rise of the Napa Valley. His self congratulatory style and amatuerish writing style are almost too much to bear at times (On one page I counted four exclamation marks). Notwithstanding, I have to admit that I still really enjoyed the book. Take note, however, that this is coming from someone who has a fascination with the man and the wine he makes.For those who want a truly magnificent book about Napa Valley without the self promotion, try James Conway's ""Napa."" A stunning history."
3,Not like the original,"I got my Oster blender from my parents, they got it in the 70's as a wedding gift. I wanted to replace the pieces but the plastic is much more cheap than the original and the top is a hard top instead of the old rubbery one. It gets the job done, but don't expect it to last like the original ones!"
2,Cheap Plastic,"The jar came in the mail with a crack already in it. To the vendor's credit, they upgraded us to the higher quality, shatter-proof plastic jar. If you are looking for a replacement blender jar, spend a few extra dollars and get the stronger plastic."
4,Smells Good,Good stuff. First of all it arrived on time and was packaged properly. It works although only for the short term; 10-15 minutes. However that's what I was looking for in this product.
4,Cute Stuffed Animal,"This purchase was for a two year old girl. She loved it. It is just the right size for kids 2-5. It's a bit larger than the beanie babies offered by the same company, but not too big for the little ones. A big plus is you can toss this pup in the washing machine without damaging it."
1,Its a tiny puppy,"Don't get fooled by the image of this, its really a tiny puppy, see the customer images section for this toy.I was disappointed to see it and would not have bought it if i was aware of the size. I wish the complete information (dimensions) was available on the site to help consumers make the informed decision."
1,All That Glitters Is Not Gold,"Positioned as a hypnotherapy ""textbook"" it reads as a poorly written self-promotional piece. Full of spelling mistakes and errors in grammar, Brady's book will insult the intelligence of anyone seriously thinking of a career in hypnotherapy. It does a disservice to those practitioners of hypnotherapy who are sincerely working to elevate and legitimize the profession. I expected something that would be useful and thought provoking. It was neither."
3,WARNING! This book is for GAS grills!,"I must have missed something somewhere, but nowhere in the description of this book did I see any reference to it being specially written for gas - not charcoal - Weber grills. To quote the introduction: ""All the recipes in this book were developed for and tested on Weber Summit Gas Barbecues.""Sure, it mentions ""real"" grills in passing in the introduction, but makes no concession to them when describing how to cook the (delicious-looking) recipes. Instructions to heat the grill to ""high"" ""medium"" or ""low"" aren't much use when you're fiddling with the vents and piling on the briquettes.I'm sure most of these recipes will work fine on a charcoal Weber, but it's a little disoncerting to discover a book I thought would be tailor made for my backyard faithful was intended for a far different, and more high-tech, machine entirely.In summary, it's a great book if you've got a gas grill, a ""nice"" one otherwise."
3,May not be what you expect,"This book was not exactly what I expected. It's heavily focused towards a Christian analysis of leadership. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that, but it just wasn't what I expected."
4,Love the author,"This is the author of another series. She knows how to get a plot going and weave in the characters in such a way that when I close the book, I miss those characters. It has a large Christian message which I find uplifting. The message doesn't interupt the plot though. I look forward to reading all of the Jelesburg Mysteries. This is better than the nightly whodunits or the reality shows on TV. A good book to read before bed."
1,"mad, bad and dangerous to know","wow, i had no idea that music could be so terrible until i heard this album. it is one of the most pretentious, redundant and annoying albums i have had the displeasure to experience. the lyrics are moronic rip-off attempts at the playfulness that sonic youth naturally exhibit, and the series of jumbled and idiotic metaphors are so annoying they make me want to throw up. as for the music itself, it came along at a time when it was fashionable for canadian self-proclaimed alternative bands to rip off their 70s record collections in the most tasteless and obnoxious fashion. avoid this album like the plague. with tracks like angus & iggy, it leaves the listener wishing for, well, the excellent 70s rock of iggy pop, not this wishy-washy imitation garbage."
1,Sloan's dirty little secret(Navy nothing but Blue),"Everybody in the Canadian music press screams praises from the rooftops for these guys, but the Canadian public haven't jumped on the Sloan bandwagon in any real significant way, the reason, they are the most uninspired band in Canada today. Instead of trusting their own instincts to create an original sound, Sloan hide in the sounds of 80's style pop rock bands that at most had one hit. Money City Maniacs is a juvenile basic rock song that belongs to a garage band not a signed artist. Also the band never really cuts loose with any energy or flair, everything is so timid on Navy Blues you'd wish they'd take an upper. On the whole a very uninspired rock band."
5,Canada's Finest Export,This band is absolutely amazing. And its incredible that they've managed to top their last effort (One Chord to Another). Navy Blues is excellent all the way through. Sloan have managed to maintain a style all their own and at the same time reach out and evolve like few bands can. This is a great album and a perfect step in their ever-evolving sound.
5,You can't kill Rock N' Roll,"Sloan's Navy Blues is a Rock N' Roll explosion. From the very beginning of She Says What She Means this album is a relentless slab o' rock. Iggy and Angus is a tasty treat that pays homage to the rock of yesteryears, as does Money City Maniacs, my personal favorite. The amazing thing about this band is that no matter how apparent the 60's and 70's influences are within their music, Sloan still make it sound modern. One aspect of the band that is rare in rock music today is that each member contributes to the songwriting process, even going so far as to sing. It is quite uncommon to see multi-intrumentalists work this well together in a band and although they have had their differences in the past, they have obviously gotten over them. The day that Sloan finally gets the recognition they deserve will be a happy one."
5,Sharp!,"Definite improvement over the standard Wii cable. Not high def, but it does enhance the picture for Wii games, which are not high definition anyway. Don't forget to switch your console settings to edtv after you've connected the cable or you won't experience the improved clarity this reasonable little cable offers."
5,Works,Well-constructed cable for a fraction of the cost of an OEM cable (I got mine for about $4 shipped). Effective length of the cable is about six feet. Picture quality is a bit better than with the replaced composite cable. Why *not* try it at this price?
1,dumb fear based book,"I don't like this book at all. I could hardly get myself to read it. It is all over the place with whether it's focus is figuring out if you are mentally ill or have depression and is filled with fear based information that feel like threats to me. It is short, but worthless."
2,Not an ordinary play.,"""Oedipus Rex"" is a play that needs to be discussed afterwards and is certainly not a pleasurable read. I dislike myths of all sorts, so I knew going into this play that I would find it discouraging to read. The language is at times difficult, especially since the delivery and reading of the lines would be different today. The play is already short, but certain scenes are prolonged much too much. I do not recommend."
1,?confusing?,"I found this book to be very confusing and boring. This was not something I choose to read it was required material for our senior english class to be read. The book is very hard to understand, you can't skip a few pages and keep going because you will be lost. You have to be devoted to read it, you have to read each page carefully and examine every sentence to find out what the true meaning is. What turned me off to this book was the incest, its not my thing. I'm not into that stuff nor do I enjoy reading it. I think someone could make this into a great horror show out of this...""the man who is his own dad"" or something like that."
3,It's sort of like a really bad talk show...,"The classic play ""Oedipus"" has stood up against time to be one of the most renown pieces of tragic drama today. Although written thousands of years ago, the ironic elements of ""Oedipus"" still captures readers and audiences. The grusome detail of the incest and homicide draws in people because of its obvious taboo nature. I thought the play was extremely sad and like others I was a bit disgusted at the outcome. Knowing what was happening before the characters was frustrating, I wanted to warn them before they got in a even bigger mess. At the end of the book I could honestly look at the dilemas going on in my life and they seemed like small potatoes compared to Oedipus. I mean at least I didn't marry my mother! As a classic drama I found it intertaining, but in the same way I find Howard Stern and Ricki Lake intertaining."
3,Oedpius 's luck,Oedpus the book was a really confusing book if you didn't pay very good attention. The book was well written and seemed like it could be based on a real life situation that has come back to haunt someones hidden secrects that people know the truth to and are scared to face the facts in life.
1,"I got what I paid for, a cheap product","I took a chance on these and got burnt. Granted, they were inexpensive. You have to screw them together when they arrive. But, the parts don't attach to each other well resulting in the hangers coming apart as soon as you hang something on them. In this case, it was a dry erase board for my cube.I wouldn't recommend them."
4,Incorrect Photo,The photo does not represent the product you will get. You will get a skinny black plastic piece that gets screwed onto an aluminum hook. It works okay though. We use them to hold dry erase boards. I have no complaints with them.
4,Take Care With This Small Roasting Pan,"There are two types of Calphalon Hard Anodized Roasters: ones with handles that fold down (like on this pan) and ones with handles that are upright (French Roasters). I prefer to use the French Roasters, as these pans are much easier to lift out of the oven by their large handles when wearing oven mitts. I've gotten burned a few times from this Calphalon small roasting pan when I've tried to lift up its folded-down handles. I don't recommend this pan for roasting for this reason alone. For a large turkey or goose, I use my Calphalon Commercial Hard Anodized 18-inch French Roaster with a Calphalon large nonstick roasting rack. For beef or pork roasts, legs of lamb, hams, chickens, or ducks, I use a 16-inch French Roaster with a medium nonstick roasting rack. For a small roast, I do use this 14-inch Roaster (without using the handles) with a nonstick folding v-rack. I've had excellent roasting results with all the Calphalon pans."
5,Awesome,It just keeps getting better and better. The third season is even more entertaining ... can't stop watching all the episodes!
5,Freaky,"I watched this show almost from the begining. It is the most amazing show out there, hopefuly they don't kill it like other great shows.The ending for this season was absolutely superb. I would have never throught that they would end it that way.The last scene absolutely freaked me out. It was osem."
5,Great Show,"This show is great science fiction. A lot of the other reviews talk about X-files and Lost. I was never a fan of either one of those shows, but I love this one! The character development is fantastic. Based on the reviews, I expected the first few episodes to be substandard, but I really enjoyed them. It gets addicting. I definitely should not have started watching this at night, because I stayed up all night watching the first season. I wish I would have gotten into it sooner, because now it's going off the air. It's a great show that really keeps me guessing about what will come up next."
5,Fringe benefit,"I'm so sorry that it went off the air. I actually turned the TV to the Fox channel looking for it Friday at 9pm. It sure left a gap in my psyche because that show raised the bar and there is nothing, at the moment, that can reach that height!! Can they make another show that make all your senses and intellect stand up and take notice? Good luck with that, because that was the Fringe benefit!!!"
2,Unusable discs,I purchased season 2 and now I have to return them. None of the discs play in my DVD player.
4,Season 2 Concludes with Another Cliffhanger,"I am not a fan of concluding these seasons with big cliffhangers. However, most series do this to keep you watching for the next season. On this series' end, it looks until the last 5 minutes like we have everything nicely wrapped up and in fact that one could CONCLUDE the entire series on happy notes all around, even with Peter and Walter reunited, Olivia and Peter as a couple and the evil Walter, in the alternate world, defeated. Then an enormous monkey wrench in the works is shown to the viewer in those last five minutes so that you will be glued to your set next season! I did not see this curve ball coming but I will admit that it should make for some interesting viewing in the next season."
5,Tv Magic!,"This season was amazing! The first season did a great job of introducing the characters and the pattern, but season 2 really hit it home with the meaning of it all. As you progress through the season, the reasons for everything become more clear, and they all fit together. There are explainations to questions that were elduded to in season 1. JJ Abrams does an amazing job of making the story grow organically. The plots and story lines don't feel forced, or suddenly changed in order to make a certain episode fit. The actors have amazing chemistry and they really bring the characters to a new level.I would suggest this season for anyone who wants to have a great ride through the paranormal. Though watch season 1 first, or you may be lost! I bought my season from Amazon, the seller was amazing and my overall experience was great!"
5,Love all fringe seasons,"I am really sad these wearied are over! If you enjoyed xfiles 10 years ago, this is a show for you. I have purchased all seasons on amazon video, so I can relive sci-fi fun over and over."
2,Product in worse condition than expected,I expected this product to be in better condition for the price that I paid. The case was broken and two discs of special features were missing. I did not recall this being told in the product description.
2,It's OK o sleep through the first five discs,"This second season of ""Fringe"" experiences a big drop-off in the quality of story-telling. Most of the episodes are stand-alone stories of freaky, far-fetched cases that land on the Fringe unit's lap. A few episodes give us some back story for a few of the characters. Very little of this is entertaining, and by the time the series returns to the ""our world vs. our world's parallel universe"" narrative, you will be wondering whether to invest your free time elsewhere. I plowed through, but I don't know if it was worthwhile. That's simply a reflection on how bad most of these episodes are. The last couple episodes, it has to be said, are pretty damn good."
2,"The first three months it worked great, then died!","I really wanted to give this unit a good review because I really liked having the 512 megs available.I've owned this card for the last 5 months and have been going back and forth with Viking to get it replaced. They are very efficient at giving a replacement but I have recieved defective replacement units twice so far and have been without it's use for almost two months. I paid twice what it is today which doesn't bother me (technology speed).The replacements have not accepted any data beyond 58 meg and then crashed, no matter which computer, which CF reader, My laptop or PDA, it doesn't work and now I am frustrated. All my 256 meg Sandisk, Mr Flash and Kingston work fine. If you want a reliable CF card I think you may want to look elsewhere."
1,worked two weeks then died,"Just like the title says: It worked two weeks then died. Since this was within Amazon's return period, Amazon handled the return without hassle. I recommend getting the better (albeit more expensive) cards such a Simpletech."
1,Excellent when working,"Recieved the Viking 512MB CF card and was thoroughly impressed. Took it on vacation to Fiji Islands for a month and 400 pics no problems. Upon return, card first started to give malfunction error and was corrected by reinserting card. But after another week completly wouldn't work. Buyer beware, ..."
4,"Good card, Good price","I've been really pleased with this card, especially for the price. The only reason I would not get this card is if you are going to be doing a lot of high resolution sequence shots. Then I would get one of the Scandisk Ultra II cards with the 9mb write speed. This is a great card for point and shoot cameras, but you can only get about a frame per second or a little better when shooting a 8 x 10 superfine resolutions with a Canon A70."
2,"Very sneaky rebate, be careful",Card works as expected. Beware that you have less than a week from the time you receive the product to turn in the rebate form which flows with conditions.
2,"Memeory corruption due to the card, not the camera",I am using a this card with a brand new Canon S400. Every 1 out of ~6 pictures will be corrupted. My friend has the same card and the same camera as mine but has no problems at all. Therefore I think the card is defective and I will be replacing it by calling Viking.
2,Not fit to description.,The case was not a full size guitar case and it was a left handed case. My brother in law's guitar doesn't fit in it properly. It doesn't even close.
5,Brilliant Router!,This router worked perfectly! Didn't find a problem with it at all. Definitely worth the money!
4,new life for old printer,I only use recon. cartridges for my old printer. Initially I had a few problems with the shipping damaging the cartridges but the vendor was very nice and cooperative. We finally got it right and the cartridges work perfectly in my HP 930a.
2,deceiving,the color one is already not printing. Message:''check the color cartridge''. So soon!!!I'll have to buy another hp 78.
3,SLOW SLOW SLOW,I could have made my own ink and cartrridges in the time it took for these to get to me. Get with it!
2,Very good price but.........,"Not all of them are working 100%, could print 56 color pages with one of the color cartridges but the second one was not good, colors did not come out right. Was still cheaper as in some shops. I guess it's a lottery."
3,Too little of Gaal ...,"I expected little more insight on the Luis van Gaal's workshop. There's only one, two chapters that actually describe Luis van Gaal's philosophy and his apporach to the game of football. I was really disappointed that the book focused more on Gaal's assistents than on himself.One was clear, Dutch's football philospohy was clearly stated and that's a plus. Too much talking about preparation to the final of UEFA Championship game against AC Milan, although it was quite interesting how big teams do that, but I think it was not the purpose of the book. At least that's not what I was looking for."
4,"So far, so good....","I've only had my machine a few days and so far, so good. It's a very good looking and good performing machine. I like the one machine instead of two different colored appliances on my counter. It's lightweight. The cap to the expresso part is ""hidden"" beneath another lid, so it is less temptation for a curious or inexperienced person. My only complaint is that when I pull out my coffee carafe, sometimes the filter holder comes open with it. Other than that, I've been enjoying my coffee and expresso daily. I would recommend."
4,Decent cover boots !,"Ok so i just got these today ( from a different site tho) They are pretty comfy and have that leather look ! its just they do look better in the pic lol and they werent that tight on me so i might find some thick stockings or something to use underneath maybe if not , its not that bad. I would reccomend them though , it is just for halloween : P"
1,"By nick, not mary.","'tis my father.I am walter, if you've read the book.Although my name is truly Nicholas Earl Charles Whitemenkilledtheingins ButtflowerAnyways.This book is slander. Plain and simple.Don't get it.Anyways, his mother was awesome, his daughter is the most independant person ever, my mother was not begging him to come back to her, the man who wished she'd fall and crack her head*.*now back to the head cracking. I'm the one who ended up with the cracked head, and no skull in the back of it.People shouldn't cause brain anneurisms, it really hurts.So if you want obnoxious lies and slander, PLEASE buy this book.If you like truthful things, go buy something good. Pretty please."
3,Not Made in Germany as advertised & as stated on the box,"One of the product pictures showed a close-up of the blade displaying it was ""Made in Germany"". The box it came with also stated ""Made in Germany"". ALL THESE ARE FALSE ADVERTISING !!! Each of the steak knifes were stamped ""Made in Spain"" :("
1,Bad zipper,The bag worked well for a few weeks then the zipper started breaking down. Teeth came out and I was no longer able to zip it all the way. Then more came out and then they started shifting around so it was impossible to zip it at all. I now just use a canvas tote and that has been the best idea. Very dissatisfied. I suppose if you only use your product once a week it would last longer. I use mine multiple times daily for work and it just did not hold up.
4,Pretty...,"I like this dress...the queen size is fairly loose though. I am 5'4"" and a 1x normally. This dress says it is for 1x -3x, I have plenty of room even with my big tush and thighs. I like the halter style...but be aware, it cannot be adjusted. The dress was delivered quickly and came with a very little matching g-string. A good price for a cute piece."
4,Very pretty and sexy,One of my favorite mini dresses. It is stretchy so I would recommend you buy a size smaller. My man loves it and I love the way I look in it.
3,Not very good,You buy what you pay for. Looks very cheap. A way too strechy... My husband doesn't like it at all.
3,ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL,THIS ITEM IS SEXY BUT NOT SNUG ENOUGH FOR SOME ONE TINY LIKE ME. AND PROBABLY TOO SNUG FOR ANYONE ABOVE A JR. SIZE 7. ITS ALSO MADE PRETTY CHEAPLY.HOWEVER IT DOES ITS JOB OF TURNING ON YOUR B.F. OR HUBBY.
4,Cute and comfy,"This feels nice, not scratchy, but kinda big. I would've preferred it a bit tighter. Although it's the size it is I still love it and so does my hubby. Big smiles when I walk in the room. The thong sucks though. Not that it really matters... ;)"
1,Trevis Insulated Glasses,"Don't waste your money. These glasses are of poor quality and I paid $10 each for them by the time I paid shipping. They do have condensation on the sides plus one of them nearly cut my lip. When I called to tell the company the glasses were real rough around the edges, they asked if I could file them down. I was shocked by this question. They did send me a replacement, but they were all blue and I had ordered the assorted colors. I am not happy with my purchase and do not recommend these glasses, not at $10 each. Maybe $2.50 each. I was considering buying the larger glasses, but not after receiving these."
5,Tervis Tumblers...always great performers,"Tervis Tumblers - Clear - 12 oz Tumbler - set of 4We've enjoyed Tervis Tumblers for many years. They are durable and withstand daily use and washing in the dishwasher. Don't let the price ""put you off."" These will last ""forever"" whereas cheaper glasses make a swift trip to the recycle bin. Shipping from the Beall's website through Amazon was quick...could't have had a better shopping experience. In fact, I'm going to order more. Although we own 18 in various sizes, we still could use another 4. They don't perspire on your table tops...check them out!"
5,"A gift to my son, his favorite book","This is my 4 year old's favorite book. He recieved it for his 1st birthday and we have been reading it ever since. It grows with him from looking at the illustrations at age one, to using the bookmark, reading on his own and looking up his favorites in the rear index. Better yet, I never tire of the clever adaptions. I give it to every new mom I know. Amazon has a great price, when I'm slow and have to buy it at the store I pay $[...]"
2,watch your mouth,"Some of the poems just don't make sense and the language is very outdated, I would feel shy to read them to my daughter and she doesn't even know what I'm saying.words that appear:Pussy = catdick = richardgay = happycock = rooster"
2,Laughable,"This movie was so bad that it was funny, no wonder it wasnt in theaters. Its about a serial killer that dies and returns as a snowman, he then goes on a killing spree. I think this influenced the Micheal Keaton film of the same title. I gave this one two stars because it was funny, although I would not reccomend this. I'd reccomend the Keaton one before this"
2,JACK FROST - Horror Or Comedy?,"First off - let me say I am a HUGE horror movie fan - that said this has got to be one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen with TERRIBLE special effects. It seems as if a child wrote it, directed it & chose the HORRIBLE cast. This is good ONLY if you need a good laugh. A killer snowman! Give me a break! This is worse tham ""Leprechaun 4 - In Space""! Nuff Said!"
3,Somebody hyped this movie?,"You've got to be kidding. This little-seen direct-to-video has to be...well, seen to be believed. It's intentionally campy, and done on a ludricously small budget. But once you get past that, it's great fun as every imaginable horror-snowman possibility is explored."
1,Horrorible,"This movie is just totally dumb, it's about a serial killer who dies but comes back as a Snowman. Anyway it's [bad], the most watchable scene is also it's worse. It involves Shannon Elizabeth ""American Pie, 13 Ghosts"" being [abused] by the Snowman in the shower with a carrot. Also a scene where a kid's head is cut of with an ice skate. I found the movie more disturbing than funny or scary for obvious reasons. I wouldn't even recommend it as one of those movies that you and your friends poke fun at when you're drunk."
3,worth a look,It was ok...some of the graphics were kind of edgy but all in all it had a good storyline.It wasnt no jason voorhees but the killer did have some original ways of making his victims suffer.Not very original in the setting though ..a small town filled with kind of hickish people trying to catch frosty the snowman...worth a look though check it out and trust me you will know if you want to watch it from the beginning because it is packed with killing.
3,Intentionally cheesy horror-comedy,"This movie is hilarious! Don't watch it expecting a straightforward slasher/horror movie; it's all got to be taken tongue in cheek, from the obviously fake snow to the pun-laden lines tossed off by the psycho snowman himself.The DVD looks and sounds pretty good, though the menu is horrible and there are no extras.Either way, it's B-movie fun for all!"
4,7 qt. casserole,excellent use this brand interchangable with emeralware and other top brands . I shop these brands by price only as they are =s
4,Very useful,"Like previous reviewers, I was also surprised by the light weight and thinness of this pot. I own several other pieces of Calphalon cookware, and this one is by far the least sturdy feeling of them all. However, it performs very well - heats evenly and quickly, cleans easily, and has a small footprint for such a large capacity. It stains easily, but who cares? I definitely recommend this item - it's a great bang for the buck!"
5,Calphalon Casserole a Winner,"This is an excellent Dutch Oven or casserole, large enough to make a big beef stew, and very light weight which makes it easy to handle. Meat browns quickly, and with little sticking. It's much better than the Le Creuset pieces I had been using."
2,Calphalon Commerical Hard-Anodized 7-Quart Chef's Casserole with Lid,"Although the quality of this product looks good, I was very disappointed in the thickness of the pot. It is very thin compared to Calphalon I have purchased in stores."
1,Caphalon commercial Hard-anodized Casserole w/ lid.,"It stains very easily(Even water marks, when I boiled water for spagetti.)Everything sticks to it.It is not non-stick.I bought five of them and have given to my family they all say the same thing.I am Very very disapointed with this purchace."
1,where's my fish,This food clouds the water very easily even if you feed sparingly. Even a few flakes will cause your water to cloud. Very disappointed with this product.
3,This sometimes very dark work is powerful,"A look inside is collection of poetry by Von Soltwedel revealing a look into his very soul. This sometimes very dark work is powerful in his staccato use of language to reveal hidden feelings and hopes. Sometimes light and full of hope, but always with a bit of caution this poet captures the ups and downs of just living life and all that entails. Good Poetry is, it seems always from deep within the poet, the final version always full of tears and joy. You cannot read this collection without getting a full dose of both. Poetry buffs will find this one difficult to put down and I will list it under the category of must reads.Mark Reid Editor1(at)newbookreviews.org"
2,It's ok,The lid doesn't stay on unless you hold tight and it still leaks a bit. This wasn't a set it was a bunch of different parts advertised as a set. I'm only happy it's metal and I don't have to worry about breaking it. Even so I'd probably buy glass if I did it over and have a snug fitting lid and a handle.
1,Ternon's propaganda,"I find it shocking that an author such as Ternon can claim to be an expert in his subject and yet take pride in announcing, as he does in his introduction, that he has not consulted primary sources that might prove unfavourable to his propagandist thesis.He appears to believe that it is not neccessary to consult documents in Turkish or Ottoman Turkish, both languages of which he admits he is ignorant, since the evidence he wishes to consider is, according to him, ''overwhelming''.As is all too sadly the case in this subject, apologists for Armenian nationalism apparently cannot bring themselves to consider and evaluate with proper seriousness, evidence that is awkward in its fit with their emotionalist prejudices.The book is in beautifully elegant French, liable to persuade through its eloquence rather than the historical rigour of its research into primary sources.How sad that the attitudes of World War One persist into the late twentieth century."
3,Good game,"This is good, I just worry about overuse of the buttons beause of how hard you are sometimes pushing to get pac man to go where you want, or especially when you are shooting at things, but otherwise the graphics are teh classic games!"
3,Not that fun...,"I thought that playing all the old games would be fun. However, upon getting the games, I realize that playing them after all this time just wasn't the same. Its like seeing Happy Days after all these years and wondering why you ever liked it in the first place. It is a marginally fun play, but I got really tired of it really fast..."
3,Love the oldies!,"I bought this for my girls, 5 and 7...they are huge DSi fans...MArio is their fav, but I wanted to see some of the old hits and liked the price being a little less then the newer games so bought it when I purchased our second DSi for youngstest daughter. She had played Pacman somewhere else and loves it...they havent ventured into the other games much yet...but I have! Wanna look for Frogger next!"
2,Its pretty ordinary,It started off pretty good with some interesting examples but then I found it pretty ordinary. Their is little I found particular interesting or new in what the writer had to say. I certainly do not feel that I have learnt a great deal about this subject since reading this book
4,A brilliant text for the neophyte,"I don't know what the other reviewers are complaining about, there are numerous texts on magic in print and many of them are for the more adept student (why not try Julius Evola's work), but I found this to be one book I recomment most highly to beginners. It covers the most important aspects of what is fundamental to all magical workings: concentration and visualization exercises. This book, in conjunction with Peter J. Carroll's Liber Null & Psychonaut, lay down the groundwork using semantics that are easy to grasp and not overly burdened with ritual, dogma, and other baggage from magic's past. Highly suggested."
4,perfect for practical use,"I consider the book a perfect guide written by a professional for professionals. If you are looking for scientific completeness and complication, go somewhere else. If you are looking for a competent down-to-earth reference, this is your book. I wonder when the third edition of this valuable tool will be published."
1,A Compleat Waste of Your Time,"After reading this book I was charged. I was excited about using these techniques in my daytrading. To my dismay I lost money - a lot of money. I could not believe that such truly logical,well-thought-out techniques did not actually work! Trash this book! Use it as kindling. One would get more use out of it in this manner. Only wish I could return it!"
2,"OK as an overview, weak on specific technique applications","This book (the first of two volumes) offers a good overview of commodities futures trading for those unfamiliar with the subject. Covers most of the commonly used technical indicators without explaining their mathematical derivations, offers few examples of their applications. Author seems to be aiming for the lowest common denominator - he claims to trade primarily on technical factors but offers only a weak explanation of what this is supposed to mean. Sections describing desirable personal attributes of the successful day trader are insightful but comprise too much of the book and one wishes for something more substantial. A short read which can be useful as an introduction to day trading."
3,Good; not quite compatible with the Casio Privia,"This stand was simple to assemble, stable, and suits my purpose as an intermediate piano player, however it it does not quite fit the Casio Privia series keyboard I own. The keyboard is a little narrow for the stand (from front to back), so it tends to slide toward the stand's back rubber stoppers while I play. Playing with the keyboard resting against the back stoppers is fine, however this doesn't provide a perfect parallel angle with the floor.Finally, as noted by previous reviewers, the stand is also very tall (adjustable heights meant for use seated or while standing). The lowest setting is okay for me, an adult who is 5'9"", while seated on a tall bench, but I'd consider another model for players more than a few inches shorter than me."
3,"Beware, not for Yamaha EZ-200","This stand does not fit Yamaha EZ-200. It has adjustable heights but the top legs do not fit into the grooves at the bottom of the keyboard. The lowest height is too wide and the next heights up are too small. My keyboard just floats uneven on this stand because the bottom of the keyboard is not flat. I hope there isn't an earthquake or someone doesn't knock it over because it definitely is not secure. I'm tempted to try the other cheap stand on Amazon but I don't want to waste more money if it doesn't fit either. Overall the stand isn't bad for the money and it's easily adjustable, it just doesn't fit my keyboard."
5,Cuddling Teddy Roosevelt?!,"Cuddling Teddy Roosevelt is kinda strange...but cuddling a soft bear is better. Who would've known that the teddy bear was named after a president!In this children's picture book, children will be amazed that they know a bit of history after they read this beautifully written/illustrated book.~ErinAge 11"
4,Excellent ... Just like listening to the real show.,This C.D.(show) really has excellent taste. If you want a C.D. with real style and versatility you should most definitely by Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat !
1,One More Trip To The Barn,"I saw Jack Cashill on C-SPAN and was curious enough to review his book at my local Borders. This book is pure nonsense based on conjecture, innuendo, and with no proof. If Cashill thinks he has a case he should pursue it through the courts. If he is right and has proof (which of course he isn't and doesn't) he has the story of the century. This guy is nothing more or less than a right wing crackpot who is making one more trip to the barn to milk the Clinton conspiracy cash cow. Nice try Mr. Cashill, but the first four letters of your surname is what this book really is about........cash for you."
5,A lifesaver!,This product is just wonderful! My roommate researched it and purchased from the same site. Then I did. I'm now going to buy one for my parents' house as well! This has saved me through these rough winter months while my landlord was cheap with the heat :-P thank you so much!!!
1,don't buy it if you want a quiet heater,"This one is just too noisy. I was very disappointed since it is so loud regardless the setting is at Low, High, or Auto."
3,"Too small, doesn't heat enough area",I purchased 2 of these because I trust the DeLonghi name. They are too small and don't do the job I needed them for.
1,everything sticks to this pan after 1 year of use,"After one year of use, everything I cook in this pan now sticks, even with plenty of oil. I paid $19.99, and will never waste money on another calphalon again."
2,stainless steel is better,"Like one of the reviewers below, used this pan once, to heat up spaghetti sauce. Tried cleaning it as recommended with bon ami, and the bottom still looks like crap. It's all discolored and mottled looking. Nothing takes it off. That's after ONE use!! From now on, only stainless steel for me."
1,Another Chinese Made Time Bomb,"Given the lack of quality and the dangers associated with goods made in China, these pots should be returned. Calphalon has taken a great product and has put it's consumers at risk to save a buck in manufacturing."
4,Calphalon Commercial 21/2-Quart Shallow Saucepan,"This is my first experience with Calphalon. I am an avid cook who uses a gas stove, and I have used many high end cookware items over the years. My rating of 4 stars is based on using the pan in several different cooking methods and observing the results. I enjoyed the evenness of heat distribution. The cool handle. The shape of the pan allowed even browing of meats and equally even cooking of rice and orzo type pastas.....The lid is light, not adding unnecessary weight to the pan, while allowing moisture to remain. I was able to achieve high heat with good results and I was equally pleased with the ability of the pan to simmer at low heat with even results. The only disapointment is in the cleaning. I have noticed some sticking however this may be aliviated with use and 'curing'. I have ordered another pan, and recommend this cookware to all who enjoy the art of cooking.....Enjoy..."
1,Not the Calphalon I know,"I am very disappointed with this product and the other Calphalon pieces I bought with it. I've had three Calphalon pieces for 2 years now and love them for how they keep an even temperature and cleanup with only a sponge. The Calphalon I purchased here is entirely different. It's very hard to keep an even temp. when cooking and the worst of all is that foods I cook in them stick and take a lot of work to clean. I've tried cleaning them immediately after cooking (instead of eating what I cooked), I've tried soaking them to no avail. I still have to spend a good amount of time scrubbing them with a soft sponge. The feel of the cookware is different than my other Calphalon as well. It's thinner somehow and feels ""cheaper"". I've learned my lesson, I won't buy this type of cookware online anymore, no matter how good of a deal it appears to be."
4,versatile usage,"I use this saucepan almost every time i cook to stir fry and browning. only thing is that its not that much very good in browning meat. i know this is not non-stick so i expected it. but overall its very useful to me and easy to clean. the size and depth is enough. this item is made in china - quality and cost wise its fair enough though...as of now, i got this a month ago."
4,bad handle design,"First of all, I LOVE, LOVE this pan. Food does not stick and it has a good seal. The only thing I do NOT like about it is the handle. It's edges are not rounded enough and it is too slim to get a good hold on.The handle should be a little shorter and fatter. But I still would not trade it for anything else. I am going to buy a silicone sleeve for it for it to be easier to handle."
4,Great little saucepan,This sauce pan is great for a small family. It is truly non-stick and is easy to clean inside and out. The lid matches and is easy to clean as well. The only thing that would have improved my rating is for a glass lid so I can watch the food as it is cooking.
3,So-So pot,"After hearing so many good things about Calphalon, I was very excited to order this when it was on sale. It does have a good weight to it, and is easy to clean, but after the first time I washed it by hand with Dawn dish soap and a sponge, the bottom inside of the pot discolored. It still serves its purpose well, but I would not expect a pot to discolor upon the very first time it is washed. The lid seems fairly flimsy, too...for a pan that is normally high-priced. This was my first piece of Calphalon and I am not certain I will be purchasing more."
4,Best pan in kitchen,"Just ordered this pan and am very pleased with purchase. For the price, it is way below market price. Cooks great and looks great. So easy to clean!"
5,Calphalon 2 1/2 qt. shallow saucepan,Great pot and just the perfect size for many dishes.A very good deal and worth every penny.
5,calphalon sauce pot,I am never disapointed when I buy Calphalon!!!!!!! And at a supper price at that!!!
3,overrated,"I've used their products for years, and do not findthem as good as they are claimed to be."
3,... ... ...,"This pan with cover is just the perfect size and shape when you're preparing any of the following for a small mob: caponata, chili, chinese cabbage or other leafy vegetable whose volume decreases with cooking, as well as for sauces. Its depth and shape are perfect for these items, all of which require the preparation of a roux and/or the sauteing of garlic, onions and spices in oil before adding the primary and more volumionous ingredients. There is no splash from the initial procedure, and no need to change pans for the second. Why unrated? I haven't tried it yet, so can't rate its qualities of evenness of heating nor non-stick-ness. And it's probably just as good for things that don't begin with ""c."""
3,Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized 2-1/2-Quart Shallow Saucepan with Lid,"The size and shape of this saucepan is terrific. After it was washed, a light blue residue was left at the bottom. I've found that after cleaning Calphalon Cookware, it does not seem to come as clean as it should. The non-stick surface is excellent."
3,Leaking around handle...,"I brought this pan last month. It looks great. The first time I used it - I was boiling eggs - I noticed water seeping out around the base of the handle, where it attaches to the pan. My husband banged around on it and tried to tighten it. We continued to use it and I guess his banging worked because it has not leaked since. However, it was discouraging and I would be careful. I also purchased the saute pan (same brand) and it is great - no problems. I thought the weight of the pans to be fine, nice and heavy. And, as I mentioned, they look great. Overall, it was a great buy - but the leaky handle thing is bothersome - I want to purchase more and probably will take my chances."
2,If this performs like the skillets I bought UGH!!,"I have to admit that I read some older reviews on this cookware to base my purchase on. I should of read the specs instead. I know Calphalon has great cookware if you purchase the correct item which I did not. I purchased this pan and a couple of skillets based on reviews and yes I was persuaded by the price. If anyone out there is like me read my last sentence.. Unfortuately, I threw the packing and shipping boxes away before I tried the pans. If I had not done the trash toss these pans would be returned.Please be warned ******THIS IS NOT A NONSTICK PAN******."
3,Not bad if used properly,"As someone who wrote reviews for this (and the forthcoming) volume, I certainly enjoy the book. The criticisms of ""a reader"" above are certainly valid, which is why this book should not be billed or used as a reference book. Without question, there are many errors, but I use the book primarily as an enjoyable way to check out other people's opinions of shows I attended or have on tape. For that, it's unsurpassed."
1,Waste of Money!!,I have a D-Link 524 router which has a similiar connection and needed a signal boost in order to use my laptop outside.I connected the WIFI antenna and suffered an immediate signal degradation of at least 25% and kept losing my wireless connection.I tried placing the antenna at all concievable angles and location to no avail...the magnetic base is great and it now makes a good paperweight on my desk.I tried it on my neighbours' router with similiar results.I have since bought a repeater that has increased my signal strength
5,Great toaster,"This is one fine piece of equipment. If you take the time to read the directions, use a little common sense, and practice until perfect- this toaster oven will not disappoint."
1,Too Long,"The flash express is a gimmick..a piece of toast took 10 minutes to toast. Very dissappointed in the oven's efficacy.Also, quite big. It has much more plastic than metal parts too.For the amount of money, I don't feel it is worth it. You would do better to buy a $30 non convection oven to this..."
3,Not Good Enough,"Returned this toaster oven as I really missed it not having a broiling feature. It is quite fast when toasting and did like the light feature,even if it was too bright. If you are looking for a good compact oven this is a hit."
5,Great novel by a great author,"I love Donald Harington! He is a great writer. He can make even a ghost seem sad and funny and full of life (ha ha). Seriously, this story mixes a sketchy heroine, a sketchy innocent young boy, and one of my favorite epic journeys home to Stay More. Almost every Harington novel has one, a journey home, a long description of the town and the mountains and what makes even a ghost-town feel like where you belong. That the heroine feels this way having never been before makes it all the more magical and inspiring. I think this is a redemptive tale, it's just hard to see at times. In his beautiful way, he makes even the worst offenders at home in his magical redneck world. There are characters like these in my small town, and I think underneath the ""Lolita"" homage is a real look at this part of small-town life in the Ozarks."
1,Disappointment,"I was extremely disappointed in this obvious imitation of ""Lolita."" There appeared to be no spirit, no life force or reasoning behind Ekaterina's prepubescent preoccupation (apart from the mention from her experience at age 19); at least Humbert (in ""Lolita"") had an impetus for his fascination that wasn't sexually related. The lack of love, concern, or caring in ""Ekaterina"" is ludicrous, and makes for an upsurd piece of ""literature."" And the switiching between the ""surreal"" and the ""real"" was enough to give a person a headache. It was more bizarre than a Dali painting. I think Nabokov would roll over in his grave if he knew about this. Don't waste your time with this rank imitation by Harrington - stick to the original master of satire, humour, and word play: Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov."
5,A very sexy inflatable kayak,This kayak is great - it blows up in 5 minutes and you can get great depths. I suggest blowing it up really tight or else the viewing panel will bubble a bit.
5,Heart-warming Christmas Tale,"In today's consumer world Christmas has often become a materialistic affair with hundreds of dollars spent on expensive gifts. Often we forget that there are also those that are less fortunate. Many children would be all too happy for only a small present for Christmas. This timeless Carl Barks classic comic tale tells the story of how three better off children, Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck, want to change a Christmas for those children that live in Shacktown. The story speaks to children and adults alike and has a powerful message of social justice."
5,Better than Whitney,"The so far last album of Meli'sa that I know of. I always liked her verymuch. She has an intense, silky voice, and she really can sing! The singles""Still in love with you"" (written by Al Green) and ""Through the tears""aren't really convincing, which is why noone has heard much of this album.But it's a very good album! The production is fine (Louie Vega, Attala ZaneGiles), the song quality is good and the voice is great. The lyrics areabout love, honesty and charity. Melodies like ""Let's be real"" and ""Now Ihave someone"" would make Whitney Houston jealous. My favourite is ""Whatchange have you made lately"" that features a big choir and has a boombasticsound"
1,What were they thinking!,"Although the Beastie's, Nirvana, Green Day, and even Hole are on present this album, where is Rage, Queen, Page and Puffy, or anyone else besides the washed-up, one-hit wonders Arrested Development? Save your money and buy something with a little bit more thought and effort put into it."
1,"FIRE THE CLOWN, THAT DID THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","NO FEAR, NO SPECIALS, NO DEVO, NO LEON REDBONE, NO ZAPPA, NO B-52's, NO PRESERVATION JAZZ HALL, NO FULL BOWIE COVERAGE, NO BLUES BROTHERS!!!!!RAP & OTHER WATERED DOWN CRAP FROM THE LATE 80's can take a flying LEAP!!!WE WANT the AVANTE-GARDE/DADA PUNK/NEW WAVE of L.A./N.Y. during the reagun dictataorship!!!!(...)JUST ANOTHER CASE WHERE SOMEBODY WHO DOESN""T DESERVE TO BE IN THE POSTION THEY ARE IN, IS GIVEN AN OPP TO DO SOMETHING THEY HAVE NO IDEA of WHATS GOING ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Sad selection,I'd like to give this cd credit for having Green Day and the Beastie Boys on it but just the fact that Alanis Morissette is on there and not Queen means this cd isn't worth buying.
4,"Don't like Postmodernism, but great explanation of what it is.","I believe the Bible is a propositional book and disagree with many (aka most) of postmodernism ideas. However, this is the first book I've read that has helped me understand how postermodernism is effecting theology. In general, nobody in the postmodern movement wants to define it because, well, that is not very postmodern! Tony has done a very good job articulating his point of view.4 Stars for a well written book, not so many starts for a not so good theological movement."
2,My humble opinion...,"Well I bought both the chocolate chip and the oatmeal raisin. I can tolerate the chocolate chip, it's the only flavor I can stand. It's a dry, unappetizing cookies, BUT it does do the trick, I'm not hungry. I eat one for breakfast, lunch, and mid afternoon snack and a small meal of mostly protein. I have lost weight (10 pounds) in about 2 months. I DO NOT recommend the oatmeal raisin. I think it tastes absolutely vile. I had to spit out the one I had, kinda bummed as I have a full box just sitting on my counter. Overall it does the trick, it's not an amazing tasting cookie, remember that, but it gets you through the day without starving. Remember to drink a lot of water with it. But stay away from the oatmeal (YUCK!)"
5,Love them!,"I have been consuming these for two months as part of a reduced calorie diet and exercise program. I have lost significant weight. This is not a miracle diet, I have put in considerable time and effort and ignored my cravings, but it is a good base. The chocolate chip is just sweet enough, but is still not a normal cookie. I alternate these with the oatmeal raisin cookies depending on what I am in the mood for."
2,"SERVES IT'S PURPOSE, BUT..................................","It does what it is supposed to do, BUT it is so very uncomfortable under the arms! Just need to be made less bulky & of a softer, less stiff material."
5,"Man, wow!","I have always loved this CD, with very listenable tunes, you will love this CD too... Two twin brothers from Scotland can definetaly pull of a nice soundtrack!! ""I'm On My Way"", is also feautured in the ""Screk"" soundtrack... A definate best buy!"
4,"Fine, but please look for ""This is the Story"".","""Sunshine on Leath"", the Proclaimers second record is worth owning for the soaring ""Sean"" alone. In contradistinction to their exuberant and incisive first record, ""This is the Story"", the songs here are mostly concerned with love, the humor is less sophisticated, the production is slicker, the music and vocal arrangements are more conventional, less original. In other words, on ""Sunshine on Leath"" you're only getting a taste of what the Proclaimers are all about. Why? Sad to say, because this is their commercial bid. If you've not heard ""This is the Story"", you're missing a great lot: your life could be richer.Recommended: The Proclaimers's ""This is the Story"" (and, by the bye, Jeff Burns's ""Pentatonic Scales for the Jazz Rock Keyboardist"")."
2,Politics and Bad Music,"A few politically-oriented songs combined with poor musical skills make for an all-round funny album. Good for a laugh, but not much else."
3,Great but awkward,"The stand does everything it says it does. However, even thou the double legs makes the stand sturdy it also creates very little room for legs when you sit in front of it playing."
3,A Mixed Bag,"The plot sounded interesting, so I picked it up. Gina and Mike were subject to one antic after another. If you like that sort of thig, this is for you. If not, think twice. I thought Blaze books were supposed to be steamy. This read more like a comedy with some sensual awareness between Gina and Mike. Mike is a good guy, a little up tight. His wanting to be a part of Gina's big Italian family made sense except toward the end when he seemed to willing to go a little too far to please people who didn't consider him family. My bigger beef was with Gina. I realize she was from a different country and had a different upbringing than your average American girl. But she acted a bit like she was from another planet. The wide-eyed innocence stuff was a little over the top. Still, it was harmless and enjoyable for an afternoon."
4,Great phone system!,"Great add-on to the 1000N and 1050N bases. As small as a larger cell phone, belt clip is great to keep the phone on your hip while you use the headset. Range is great -- in the city/suburbs I can go a block or two away from my place and it still works fine. Only complaint is that you can not edit any names stored in memory (just the numbers!) so you have to delete the entry and then re-enter it.ALSO -- the reason I went with this phone is because it does NOT interfere with 802.11b as some of the others, especially Panasonics, do (the Gigarange Extreme interferes)."
1,No effect,"First, I put it as it's indicated, on the outside of the lips. I pass it over at least five times because I can't see nor feel whether it came on. I've worn the lipsticks and glosses that usually give me trouble (bleeding) but this liner hasn't helped, the gloss doesn't stay in place and neither does the lipstick.I find no use for it since it doesn't even have color.Waste of money.Plus, it's an international purchase, so I had to pay an additional $10.29 for it to deliver within my country. Not worth it."
3,Bittersweet,The idea of the story is very interesting. id say its safe to assume one of the authors has a medical background as well. However the spelling and grammar errors made the story appear written by a child. Im not even talking typical typographical errors im talking random words used in wrong places. example it would he awhile before she returned and he was ahout time he arrived. REALLY annoyed me. if those errors had not been present i would have given four stars.
1,Predictable and poor,"I found this book to be very shallow , the characters where not believable and reminded me of the type of B rate TV movie that you may stop and watch on a rainy Sunday when you have nothing better to do. The characters had no depth and I really struggled to empathise with them. The quality of the writing was questionable and one line for me sums it up and I quote ""the rain fell from the clouds"", this was the description of a storm and unfortunatley the descriptive prose did not get much better than that. The plot was predictable and you could see the ending virtually from the beginning. Unfortunately not my type of book... obviously others have enjoyed it much more than me."
3,cheap,"i still use it.its not an item you would ""save the money for a better one"" because it's so cheap, i bought it for school and still works fine. the only complaint is the leads, those were the first ones to snap"
1,Do you feel lucky?,"By buying this rubbish you're simply sending a message to whatever manufacturer in China is pumping these things out by the millions, that we're all so stupid that we'll buy anything they make if it's cheap enough.These multi meters are sold under a myriad of brand names, and in several cases, from yellow, black, grey and red, with or with out a fancy rubber condom, for prices starting at a few dollars, up to $30 or $40. Yet they all have exactly the same circuit board. They are cheaply made junk, and verge on being dangerous.They can be identified by the range scale, the three probe ports on the right side, and the hFE socket on the left. Regardless of brand or case colour, it's the same meter. The same rubbish circuit board, the same inaccurate dangerous junk. They are usually labeled 830B, which helps identify them.You're measuring electricity, your life is worth more than this."
2,Good product.. But the wire Jacks with it aren't good.,Good product.. But the wire Jacks with it aren't good... For loose connection of wire jacks it gives wrong/unstable readings
1,You get what you pay for,"I only needed an inexpensive pocket meter to keep on the jobsite to check for live wires during reconstruction. This one looked right so I bought it.[...]. It worked fine...but only once! After that first reading, it would never again read voltage. If a circuit was live, the numbers jumped all around so I knew there was voltage but it will not lock on to 120 or 220 or anything else for that matter.IMHO...JUNK"
3,Worked alright for measuring resistance,"I bought this to diagnose my dryer once it died on me. I was supposed to read the resistance over various components to check for continuity. The continuity check didn't work so well unless I turned up the range to the maximum for ohms. Overall, not bad for a little $5 multimeter as it did what I ultimately needed it to do."
1,Piece of junk,"Device just gave crazy readings. I threw it away and went to Radio Shack. Pay a few dollars more and avoid this piece of junk.It is cheap, but it doesn't work."
4,HAHAHA Yes i still have this vacuum!,"Best price I could find for the bags for my vacuum that won't die LOL! Wish they held more, but hey, that's not the bags fault...."
4,Ain't nothing like the real thing. ... But these are good,Great fitting vac bags at a really good price. Thinner that the real ones. ... However that made the suction better on the vac
5,Just what I needed,This product is exactly what I needed. It was a great price and very convenient to order on-line. I'm completely satisfied!!
1,This product is not good for Electrolux,"Don't let price fool you these bags are not genuine Electrolux, made that mistake once never again these bags tend to unseal and can mess up the motor... buy at your discretion... I have owned my vacuum and shampooer for 35 yrs now"
2,Hum....,"Dear Reader,Okay I must admit when I read the back cover I thought it would be something more along the lines of a person wrongly convicted of a crime and this girl would help him prove it. But it turned to be something way different. Both star characters are really messed up and the story has a really bad end. I might be weird liking the old fashioned 'happily ever after' end but that's the way I am. I wont tell you what happens if you are planning on reading it but check it out at a library first.No disrespect to the author, I mean I hope some day I will be able to publish a book but though you will probably never read this I do abmire the fact that you published a book I just dont like it as much as many others I have read."
5,Tenderness,Tenderness explores the possible outcome that could occur if a young girl fascinated with a teen serial killer ends up meeting him. Lori Cranston is somehow able to penetrate the heart of a monster and yet her fate is as disasterous as the girls he killed before. Eric Poole does not want to kill Lori but death has a way of following him around. The story was gripping as it described the thoughts of a serial killer and yet persuaded the reader to like him. The ending was both climatic and ironic; a perfect fit for a great novel.
4,It's Pretty Good/Weird,"I liked this book overall, as I do of most Robert Cormier books. It gets very strange in certain spots, (ie; the hitchhiking and the rock star obssesion) but the writing is good, the characters are well developed, and the story is creative, unlike a lot of books I have read lately. I will remember this book because of it's strangeness and journey into a psychopath's mind."
5,Worked perfectly,I purchased 6 of these memory cards for a trip to Asia. They worked perfectly. I didn't have any problems with data loss or card failures. I suggest SanDisk for all your memory card uses. They are very reliable.
2,"can't rate, it was a gift",I can't say if the socks work as hoped. They were a gift and he won't be using them until later this week. I will say the dealer sent them immediately & I am pleased with the service.
4,trippy as hell,"1st off, this is not a movie. it is trippy visuals. i put this on at a party i went to. people were just looking at it like WOW. its ok but not for everyone"
1,Terribly slow boring visuals and music is no better.,"Sold by all the five star reviews. I could not believe it started in black and in white normal TV square screen format. I can download better 'Kaleidoscope videos' for free, I wasted my time and money on something not worthy of my HD 65"" Toshiba TV. You can have my 'Spotworks' for $1 plus p&p."
3,NOT LED!,"Great for what they are. I was under the impression that they were led based upon my search. Other than that, just like regular Christmas lights, but constructed to outline your gazebo. Comes with clips, VERY easy to install."
1,Not Happy,"I am disappointed with the low quality circuit boards. The trails are taped on, not etched. On the plus side, the instructions are easy to follow."
4,Billfromthenexis,I enjoyed the read. I would recommend the Micheal Whitman books as a nice complement to this book.
5,Ultimate Drummer,"Tired of drummers who flake out? Pick up this little fellow to round out your band. This smurf is ready to pound out those beats 'til he's blue in the face (oh wait, he already is). The drum kit includes a bass drum, snare, hi-hat, 2 toms, 1 cymbal & the hardware to assemble it. The details on the kit is better than I expected - it even comes with a kick pedal and drum throne. The parts are small and not attached to the base, so keep this away from curious wee ones and voracious pets."
2,I was unfortunately disappointed.,"As someone who ""gobbles"" up anything related to timetravel/speculation/inconsistencies and so on, I was drawn to this book from the synopsis and the marketing premise that I considered (after reading) to be misleading. While the book does offer investigations into possible evidence of timetravel; it is only thrown in periodically throughout an otherwise boring read. In fact, I've read hundreds of books in the speculative nature and sadly, this is the ONLY ONE I haven't enjoyed."
1,Rubbish,"While the author puts forth some interesting theories regarding time travel, as well as some strange stories, he is basically showing readers how to ""make-believe"" they are in another time period. That's all well and good, but I really DO want to travel to 1975 England.If you want some solid information about time travel, don't bother with this rubbish. If you want a guide to pretending you're in 500 BC Egypt, go ahead and buy a copy."
1,not good,"The suppliers of this book are terrific - the book arrived in great condition, fast and courtious.. however, the book itself is NOT worth the purchase. It is full of misinformation. Sorry."
1,Phone does not hold its own - degrades quickly,"This phone started out as a great (rated 5) phone. Now after 3 months, it does not work even 3 feet from the stand. I would not recommend it and will not go with a Panasonic cordless phone again."
3,For the most part...,"I do like this phone. I have the unusual circumstance nowdays to have an older house with plaster/wire mesh walls throughout the house. I get great reception outside up to almost a block away, but there is one particular deadspot inside that is killing me. It is only about 25 feet from the base, and I get no reception.I have another panasonic that is a bit older with features that are better, such as programming your area code so that local calls will come through locally w/caller id, so you dont have to scroll through a menu to call back a local number.Another problem w/ both phones is that after a while you have to fiddle w/ the phone and base unit contacts to get it to charge correctly.If I had a wooden house, Im sure this would get a five-star rating, but you know how it is.I also think think this phone is identical to some uniden brand, you will get the same results out of other brands as well"
1,Terrible Phone,"We bought this phone at a department store. The base unit and one extension. The features of the phones were cool, everything we wanted. The biggest problem was the static on the line and when we turned the volume up to max it was still hard to hear. Since this is the basic function of a phone we decided to return them."
5,madeline,this doll is so cute! my daughter loved it. i would recommend her to everyone. very well made doll.
5,Really nice - but it is definitely jumbo!,"I have to say I did not read the description when I ordered this and was expecting a regular sized pencil cup. I'm glad I have it though, because I'm using it for art supplies and it will hold a lot. For example, I have 2 regular pencils, 3 Micron pens, a water pen, 2 blending stumps and 24 colored pencils in mine already and there's plenty of room for more. It looks kind of empty even with all that in it. So, if you are just looking for a pencil cup for your average desk supplies, this might not be what you want. But for art supplies, it's perfect."
2,No such prophesy,"There is not going to be a rapture like this book leads people to believe. The elect will not be taken during the tribulation. As the bible tells us that the days of the tribulation will be shortened for the sake of the elect, therefore there will be no rapture. I really wish people would read the bible in context."
5,The best Fondue,This is the best fondue set that I have used to date. The clean up is easy. The pot heats evenly and quickly due to the aluminum. There is a life time warranty. The only downside was I wish the unit came with more forks.
3,No instructions,"While the Calphalon Fondue Set looks like it will be fun to use, I haven't been able to start yet because the set does not come with any instructions. Unlike Calphalon's other products, the alcohol burner's use is not intuitive. The summary on the Amazon page is the most information I have been able to find regarding this product(i.e...get fondues started on the stove top). I have tried to contact Calphalon 4 times (both e-mail and phone) for instructions and have not received any reply."
5,Wonderful book!,"Really good reading for boys or girls, men or women -- anyone! The author weaves personal stories into excellent and memorable life lessons."
5,Read it!,"If you have boys then they need to read this book with you! We are made for work, it is a blessing and a joy to do work. Our culture has made 'me time' the ultimate goal and sells it as the most fulfilling time, but it is a lie! We are created to work and this book challenges young boys to rise to the occasion."
3,"Great illustrations, but okay story.","While this book has beautiful colorful illustrations for any cat lover, such as my daughter and I, the story is okay. We were a little disappointed by the ending. It felt like there should be a little more to it.However, the artwok is wonderful and fun for any child to look at."
2,Not satisfied at all!!,"Ordered book to replace one lost in hurricane ""IKE"" because it was my daughters favorite when she was a child. Confirmation was sent to me that all was good with order but the seller said that he did not receive the order and that he no longer had the book. I lost thousands of childrens books in the storm that can not be replaced but I was hopeful that this one would. I have not been able to find it anywhere. My daughter had asked after the storm if Where's Goldie was still OK and I thought that replacing it for her to give her for her 25th birthday would be a good surprise. I was sorry to find out that would not happen."
2,BCR Strangers In The Wind,This was not one of my favorites by them. Found some of the songs a little bit hokey. Maybe a bit to mellow sounding-not really their style.
4,"So far, so good...","I've had the fan installed for about a month, and it works as it should. I called a Hunter CSR before purchasing to inquire about the fan, and I was told the only common problem is a component that can burn up from turning the power on & off with a wall switch; in other words, use the remote only, keep constant power to the fan.Positives: Very quiet, looks great, performs perfectly, ease of use with remote, easy to install.Negatives: No manual controls (remote is the only way to control the fan), light is too dim.For the price, it seems to be an excellent buy."
5,Paris Accordeon,I purchased this recording years ago and was so pleased to find it again on Amazon. A great collection of old standards.
4,A must-read for any writer.,The title of this book is a little mis-leading as it contains more than just selling strategies for your manuscript. The authors take you step by step through the writing process with insight that comes from their own experience as writers. I found the chapter on creating believable dialogue invaluable. This book is a must-read for any aspiring author.
2,Deceptive Sensationalism at it's Best,Sensationalism at it's best. The cave diving filming is deceptive. The gorgeous stalagmites are not in Florida caves. Those shots are in Mexico or Bahamas. It is deceptive to make people believe that Ben went in to see this magnitude of beauty that simply is not there. .
1,trash it,I just finished throwing this book in the trash. I started noticing a trend in many of the articles - bash the Catholic Church. They blame some sinister church conspiracy for almost every strange happening that occurs. It seems that was their agenda in compiling this book.
1,QUESTION : WHAT IS THIS?,"ANSWER : The Complete title is :[TEEN ISSUES (PARENTS GUIDE TO GROWING PAINS)]This is NOT, nor is it based on the Situation Comedy :""GROWING PAINS ""!!!"
1,cheating item,"I wanted to get the DVD of ""growing pains""-a TV show. And when i searched, it showed in AMAZON. So i ordered. But the true name of DVD i got from AMAZON is ""a guide for parents to growing pains"", not the one i wanted. Why the item did not show its true name in AMAZON? It is cheating!"
4,Great Joseph!,"I think this and the Original Broadway versions are the best. I agree with others, the new updated techno stuff is awful. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. I saw it first around 1983 on Broadway (David Cassady - I thought he did a great job), and fell in love with it. This version has a great Joseph, like I remember David Cassady being. The male narrator is different, but you get used to that. There are other things about this version I like better as well as things about the Original Broadway version I like better. I don't like the Joseph as well on the Broadway, but I do love the narrator. So, it's a give and take, but I've seen Joseph again twice in recent years and it doesn't compare to the 80's. Happy listening."
5,Let's hear it for Gary Bond,"Well done those who stand up for the late great Gary Bond. He was the original Joseph and for some of us will always be the only one. I agree that we'd rather have the original cast LP as a CD but this almost the cast and for me will be the definitive. Let us not forget that Gary was a superb Che in ""Evita"" - better than David Essex. ITV surely still have footage of a studio version of the stage show specially done for TV. It's truncated and lasts about 30 minutes but if it were made available I'm sure it would be very popular. On a sort of related topic, when are we going to get the CD of the original London cast of ""Godspell""."
4,Voice recognition,"Dragon naturally speaking takes some time to learn and to get your pronunciations recognized, but is well worth it; I can dictate long paragraphs, then go back and edit with ease. I dictated this review."
1,BOO HISS - PREFER OLDER VERSION,"Bought this and actually ended up exchanging for Version 10 neither of which works any better than the earlier versions. These guys keep saying they are making it better, but keep selling the same old product just to make money as far as I can tell. Get a new life or product, dragon people!"
1,Didn't get the product,"The vendor never sent the item. It's been over a month since the order was made and confirmed and my credit card charged, but the item never arrived. Amazon DID get my money refunded. Thanks for that!!!"
2,slow and inaccurate,"Although I have only tried the software a few times, I was disappointed with the accuracy and speed which it translated my speech."
3,Dragon problem,Product would not allow me to register. seller indicated this had happended several times. She was quick to refund all costs.
3,Product = Ten; Customer Service/Tech Aid = One,"The product seems to be fine, but I inquired before I purshased about creating macros, and was told it was explained in the instruction manual. Well, it isn't, or at least I can't find it. You get one phone call for free, but thereafter calls are $6.99, and on line help, I think, is $16.99. I contacted tech aid two or three times on line, and never got a response (this was before I knew about the fee) and finally had to go back to the sales rep to explain my situation. He responded and explained the system to me, but should it be this difficult?"
1,I refuse to be ripped off!,"I will definitely NOT buy this product. I refuse to be RIPPED OFF $10 for EACH AND EVERY time you e-maill or call customer service. This is totally ludicrous, and the support service should be included with the purchase of the product. Apparent Nuance Dragon Naturally Speaking is trying to squeeze every nickle and dime out of their customers. I refuse to by any product by a company that will do that to their customers. I think this is about the ONLY company that charges for their support. Try to find an alternative voice recognition software company who will support their product free of charge. SHAME ON YOU, NUANCE DRAGON NATURALLY SPEAKING."
3,Dragon Naturallly Speaking difficult to train,"I purchased the program for use dictating common conversational information into my new electronic medical record (I am an Internist). I have been going through the tutorials repeatedly and, though I feel like I am being consistant, will sometimes get the commands to work and sometimes get them typed into my note. It does get most of my dictation correctly the first pass but the editing functions need work"
1,Does not work,"The program runs much slower than I type, and once it finally lays down the text, it is full of mistakes. The investment was a total waste of money."
1,they should pay me for training the product,This product reminds me that purchase price is not always important. The time I spent on that product cost me 100 times the purchase price....
3,Dragon is helpful but. . .,"Dragon Naturally speaking is a helpful but less than perfect product for speech to text purposes. (The supplied headphone microphone is too small for most heads.) When Dragon does get the translation correct it is very useful in preserving a thought without getting bogged down in the logistics of typing. However, after several weeks of use it continues to make repeated errors which lead to frustration."
2,Disappointed,"I tried the built-in voice recognition software included in Vista and decided I liked the concept. After reading some (not enough) reviews about Dragon's product I decided to buy it. Is it faster than typing? Certainly, but it produces so many mistakes that I find myself taking far longer making corrections, repeating commands, and spelling words outloud than if I had just typed the document manually. The software is expensive relative to the results it produces. The headset they included with the software is uncomfortable and even painful to use. I bought a better USB microphone but cannot get the Dragon software to recognize the device.If you only want to write occasional, simple, emails or documents the built-in Vista product does fine. If you want to write more sophisticated documents or something as complex as a novel using the Dragon product I fear you will be greatly frustrated and annoyed."
1,Pure Garbage,"Not at all what I expected...no sympathy to the plight of poor oppressed and enslaved women everywhere, nothing more than a badly written S/M letter to Penthouse...Disgusting exploitation of women sexually enslaved...horrible dreck...waste of my time...porn trash...ZERO STARS!"
3,Reasonable for the price.,"We were looking for a quality phone from a name brandcompany. We wanted a phone that had some weight, sincewe were concerned about it being knocked around on thetable. This phone fits the bill. The soundis ok, but not always crystal-clear...however, there is a possibilitythat our lines are causing the problem. For what its worth....we boughtone a few months ago and bought another for another room in the house."
2,"too thick, but works",this is an emergency phone that works..but it is so thick and uncomfortable to hold....good enough to do the trick
4,As advertised,"You just need to plug it an it is ready to go. It can be used if the power is off.Be aware that the dial numbers are at the ear piece, so you can dial the numbers and listen to the tones to check if you are dialling the correct numbers. Besides that. Good phone for emergencies (power outages)."
4,Fuctional,"The AT&T; 210 corded phone arrived today and was tested for functionality and sound clarity. Both were adequate. This phone is a decent value considering what our dollar is worth today. This same phone is offered at one of the local department stores for $15.00. I purchased this phone as a backup when the power goes down and is kept nearby the phone plug. I do not know how long this phone would last if used on a regular basis but if used this way I would not get one if kids will use it all the time. It does not appear to be that sturdy. A few drops on a hard surface may do it in. That is just my opinion however. I do not plan to test it that way to find out.This phone is NOT the quality of the old Slimline phones of days gone by. They are no longer made. If you wish to acquire one, I have seen several used ones on Ebay for $25. and up."
1,Totally unusable,"Don't buy this phone. Everyone I spoke to said I was nearly unintelligible. The ""monitor"" of my own voice in the earpiece was far too loud, and I have a quiet voice. It's a simple phone -- it's supposed to make phone calls and it utterly fails at that."
1,Ratcheting Swivel Belt Holster for Samsung x427,I was disappointed with the performance of this phone accessory. My Samsung x427 repeatedly fell out of the holder when I had it clipped to my belt. Not very secure! The clip now resides in a junk drawer.
4,Worth a Laugh,"Taken as a work of humor rather than the work of a serious logician, this book is worth a laugh or two. Perkins is right on the money when he points out Limbaugh's logical errors, but Limbaugh is just too easy a target to form the basis of a serious introduction to the subject of logic. I mean, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to recognize that Limbaugh's ad hominem statements are fallacious and lack intellecutal reasoning.Hmm, but then given the lock-step mentality of Limbaugh's dittoheads, maybe it does take a rocket scientist.Buy the book! Read it, enjoy it! You won't be sorry."
5,Fun and educating at the same time!,This is one of those rare books which is fun and educating at the same time.
3,CALPHALON PAN EVALUATION,THE PAN NEEDS A LID FOR SURE AND YOU CAN'T LIFT IT OFF THE STOVE WITHOUT BURNING YOUR FINGERS. WHY DID THEY MAKE THIS PAN SO THAT WHEN ITS COOKING ON THE STOVE THE HANDLES TO LIFT THE PAN ARE BURNING HOT???? VERY DISSAPOINTED ON ITS CONSTRUCTION I AM SORRY I PURCHASED IT WITH MY GIFT CERTIFICATE. I SHOULD HAVE MADE A BETTER PURCHASE WITH MY GIFT. SOMEONE NEEDS TO IMPROVE ON THIS ITEM!!! ...
4,"Rare classic, but not enough","This mini-album came out during Tricky's heyday and went surprisingly unheard by most people. A shame, since there are excellent songs on here that rflect heavily his hip-hop roots, probably moreso than he would pay homage to until the not-so-great ""Juxtapose"" record. This one catches him riding high off of the acclaim of his glorious debut, ""Maxinquaye"", and well within the top of his form. If you can find it, get it. Leaves you wishing it had more songs though."
2,Outdated,"This volume should be retired. While the cover might imply things of a ""Zulu"" nature, the book is a rather mundane & boring history of the regiment from inception to modern times. Pass it by unless you are a glutton for punishment. I assume most readers are searching for Zulu era info....if you are one of these, save your money and buy a different book."
1,ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!!,"The worst movie I have ever seen in my life, bar none. The people writing 5-star reviews MUST be the actors or producers of the movie. A group of highschool kids could have made a better film over summer vacation; oh, and if you are hoping for some redeeming nudity because of the NR rating, forget it."
2,Reader,"I found this book disturbing. The author defines alcoholism most narrowly: basically one must be completely out of control and not functioning on any level to qualify. This book will provide refuge for the functioning alcoholic who is looking for a source to support his denial. The author takes ""problem drinking"" very lightly, suggesting that it can and does cure itself at the drinker's will. Much of this book contradicts everything I have read or heard from all other sources (and certainly my own experience with a ""problem drinker."") The author also seems somewhat hostile to AA, a bias he should have disclosed in the preface. It is hard to believe that this book represents ""the facts,"" any more than it represents the author's perspective. Readers should not assume that the author's MD makes him anything more than a human with an opinion; and in this case, one that is not broadly accepted."
2,Suckered,"All sizzle and no steak. I am a fan of Senge's initial work. This one falls short of making a mark. Maybe I expected too much. In any regard, I felt suckered after getting half-way thru this thing and I quit. Hope you have a different experience."
5,MUST READ for all CEO/MANAGERS,This is the best most comprhensible book on the future of business and evolution I have ever read. I can not explain in words how this book has changed my life and the way I am compeled to make a diffirence in the world... I feel this book is the power of now meets donald trump.... times 100... if you want to make a diffirence in something you do or somewhere you work you must read this book.
3,"Good stereo, missing remote","I bought this one before Christmas in 2001 at a local Wal-Mart. I thought that this was a good one. But it sounds like a cheap radio. I had thought about burning CDs upon ownership and it didn't have a built-in CD recorder. I bought another stereo and it had a built-in CD recorder so I can burn CDs. I think it's an OK stereo, but the remote control is missing. I now use the latter because I haven't been using this one."
5,Found book very helpful and informative,I think this diet may be easiest to follow for Type O blood types. I found the diet to be very similar to what I am eating now with a few changes. Actually small changes. I think one of the greatest challenges for the Type O blood types is the need to eat meat and the aversion to it for some during pregnancy. I like many of the recipes and plan to incorporate them into my diet. As with anything and any book you read take what you can from it and use the info that helps you. Each person is different no matter what type blood they may have. I even read a comment from someone regarding pregnancy and eating according to blood types and although Type 0 - while pregnant she was more drawn to the foods of the child she was carrying's blood type. I really think our bodies guide us to what's best and what's most needed. This was a book I borrowed from the library but then wound up getting my own copy.
5,The Secrets of Wildflowers,This is an essential read for those that want to further explore in an in-depth manner wildflowers of all types. The story telling format blends science and folklore and flows in a pace that is most pleasing to the reader. Highly recommended for those that have any interest in this topic.
1,Non-warming footies,Do not mistake that these footies will warm your feet. They will not. The only thing that gets warm in the microwave are fragrance packets inside the footies which release a not so pleasing odor.This product description is deceptive.
1,Misleading advertising,"The ad says ""one size fits all"" which is completely false. I am size 12 and these footies are about size 9. As you might imagine, they are totally useless to me. When purchasing a similar article, make sure foot sizes are specified."
3,My feet swim in these,"I knew they were big. I bought them for a friend with larger feet than mine. But I'm glad they're not for me. I'm women's size 8 and they dangled off my feet. I could scuffle around in them but they won't hold up if you walk all over. The inserts feel like rice. I feel like you could just as easily make your own rice bag, throw in some cloves and cinnamon, and sew it all up and have something just as useful since you can't move around much while using them. If you have extra room in the feet, you could add your own inserts to warm the tops of your feet too. I think they'd fall off if you used them in bed.Still, they're perfect for cold feet and they smell very nice. Not too strong for me. I would never take the time to bother removing the inserts for heating if I used them all the time. I'd probably throw the whole things in the microwave."
4,My roommate loves them!,"I gave these to my roommate as a christmas gift and she loves them. Her feet are always cold and she will soon be moving to an even colder climate. They are a little big on her, but the fact that they are warm is good."
2,would not reccomend,"they say these will fit most people well they don't, they are really tight around the ankles, one of them is bigger then the other, only good thing is the bean bags can be taken out and i use them inside my mothers slippers instead of inside the sock they give you. not worth the money"
4,My wife likes hers,"However, One of my order for 4 more as gifts, was shorted by three (3).The shipper indicated they are sending the remaining 3.I have NOT RECEVED the missing 3 of my order.....:-("
3,"Some parts of my feet get warm, some parts not so much","Two problems with these: first, you really can't walk around in them. That's what I think most people mean when they say they're too big. I don't fault the product for that - they're ""footies"", not slippers. If you want slippers you can walk around in, then you're looking at the wrong product.The bigger problem is the location of the heated inserts: below the foot, only. So if the tops of your feet get cold, these won't help."
3,Present for Gma,"It took forever to get in the mail, but thankfully it arrived before Christmas. I am not sure about the product itself it was a present for my grandmother."
2,Sub-Par and digressive,Poorly written and badly organized. A vociferous NO for beginners and almost useless for anyone with some experience
3,Identity crisis,"This might have been a great novel if the author had chosen to keep the elements simple. Martin Harris, an unassuming botanist, learns that somebody has stolen his identity. In his quest to prove himself, Harris discovers more about his own past than he ever imagined. While this is an interesting premise, the author complicates the story by introducing too many details that go nowhere. Cauwelaart could have composed a surrealistic piece, but instead he introduces an unnecessary twist into the last quarter of the text."
4,"rest in peace, beautiful chanteuse","So glad this was finally made available on cd...along w/ the bonus Rosa Yemen stuff (previously unknown to me). Can't understand why the end of Torso Corso was abbreviated (i.e. edited). However, great to hear the mission impossible theme and jim on the move w/ lyrics not found on the original (both from the tv soundtrack by lalo schifrin-cheers rick for turning me on to this). The Rosa Yemen version of the MI theme is about 3x faster and cool too...as is Morning High in which Patti Smith and Lizzy's poetic cadences dance around one another. Exquisite! C'est magnifique!99.9% of the female rappers/singers du jour cannot touch Lizzy in terms of the effortless sexiness of her delivery."
2,Don't buy these if you have a wireless network,"I have a set of three of these phones (my mistake to buy all at once). They have had problems from Day One. I have had to return them to Siemens -- only to get the same problems back. None of their recommended fixes have worked. And worst of all, customer support has been atrocious. I recommend not buying these. I bought two other 2.4 Ghz phones from AT&T, and they have been flawless in the exact same environment."
1,WARNING NOT AS PICTURED!,"This company substitutes parts and gets away with it! You will not get the items that are photographed! Amazon will gladly refund your money, but when your 11 year old has been waiting for the skateboard to arrive, it is a difficult decision for him to send it back and wait longer to order another. We received the Flip deck that was photographed. All of the other parts were unacceptable. The trucks assembled on the skateboard are cheap silver, not black as photographed. The wheels are black and yellow, not black and red. Also, the hardware used to assemble the skateboard does not match on top. 4 of the bolts are black and 2 are red! So...this is a good deal if you do not care too much about what you will actually receive. If it matters, you should stick with a more reputable company."
5,Learn Chess,I am really enjoying the exercises he has in the book. I have not finished it yet but so far it is very informative.
5,THANK YOU BROTHER!!!,"Thanks for the long over due documentary about the men I love, respect and admire!!! Thank you!! I am making it my business to make sure the young women, men and boys in my life see it. It is well worth the $20 spent.D. EdwardsLouisiana"
5,Must see video,Invite a group of people to your home to see this video. I am not black and I totally got it!
5,Who Turned Out the Lights?,"Anna Pigeon is asked to help rescue a seriously injured friend from deep caverns, not a prospect our clautrophobic heorine relishes. But tingling with terror, Anna plunges down, and we as readers feel every sensation that terrorizes her. Once above ground again, Anna looks into a couple of murders, and her snooping draws a rifle bead to her forehead. Anna must return to the cavern depths to find the solution and in doing so, she must find and escape the murderer. This is suspense to the limit.As a longtime spelunker, I was delighted to see a mystery thriller set in a cave, and Nevada Barr does an exemplary job with the setting, explaining the effects of sensory deprivation and the suspense and fear of exploring the deep dark unknowns of caverns, all wrapped around an gripping mystery that keeps the reader guessing until the end. I tore through this book like flood waters through a canyon. Just couldn't put it down."
3,Unique...and sometimes even enjoyable,"There's no question that Neil Finn is a talented man; and if you find his songwriting and vocals in this record to be the only upside, then you should definitely check out his recent solo release. On to the matter of this CD--the best songs (by far) on this collection are the latter tracks from the band's later years...the years when, not coincidentally, Finn's influence took center stage (in tracks 11-16). These also happen to be their greatest hits."
1,the best book that I've ever read,"I would not recommend this book. It is an amazingly sad book. I would never read this book again. It's so sad because there is a lot of dying. But I will tell you about this book. First of all, there is Chizuko. She is Sadako's best friend and she supplied Sadako with her first crane. Chizuko figured out how to get Sadoko better by making a thousand cranes. Her brother, Masahiro, promised to hang every crane she made. Will she make a thousand? You must read this book to find out."
1,Boring,"I didn't like this book because it was boring, too sad and it isn't interesting to read about folding paper cranes."
1,Sadako book review,"I disliked this book by Eleanor Coerr because I only like adventure books. Another reason that I didn&#65533;t like it is because it was sad and short. This book is a true, but slow book so don&#65533;t read it. I can&#65533;t tell you the ending, so read the book to find out what happens."
4,sadako and the thondsand paper cranes,"It was a good book it was sad at the end .IT was an ok book understand the picture. the font was ok .The Theme were ok she get batter and then dies the charaeters ""sadako ,bo chen"" she get leukaemia and she dies she make thounsand paper crains it was one of the good book and really cool i cry in the middle she was adout my age.so read this book you will start to cry read it read it ."
4,SADAKO,"This is an extraordinary book, but if you're not into a mournful books thisis not the kind of story you'll like. Sadako is really brave about hersickness the couraged to make 1000 cranes to makeher goal so the gods can heal her. I would not highly recomend thisbook for not all readers, but I recommend for everyone to read."
3,Sadako,"I thought this book was an okay book. I would recommend this book to people who like sad books.This book is about a Japanese girl named Sadako who found out that she had a terrible disease called leukemia, an atom bomb disease. To save herself, she finds a cure.The cure is to fold a thousand paper cranes and the gods will make her healthy again. This book tells about hardships and deadly things that can happen to an average family."
2,sadako,"I dislike the book Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes. In the story,Sadako liked to run and she got dizzy and then she got leukemia and at the end she died.From reading the story, I learned that there was an atomic bomb and it gets you sick.After reading the story , I felt sad because everybody that got the diease died from it.I would recommend this book to be more interesting because it's not really that interesting and then it would be better."
4,A Good Start,I think this story would be a very good starting point in teaching children about Hiroshima. I do not think it provided all the information children need to know. The story was a very well-written for children. It was sensitive so children would not be scared by the story. I think that if the Japanese teach their children about the bomb peacefully we should also. I think a story like this is a very good way to start off teaching children about the bomb. I think this story should be followed up with some history about what happened. The story does not give a lot of facts about what happened. I think this would be a good start but not the only story to be used.
4,sadako,"in the story, sadako qualiflied for the relay team on field day.then she felt dizzy and found out she had leukemia. she heard an old saying that if you make 1,000 paper cranes, you get one wish.will she make 1,000?i learned about the atom bomb. i felt a little sad because she was only 3 when the bomb dropped.i recomend this book to everyone because its a tear-- jerker i liked this book and you will too!!!!! the bomb dropped on 8/6/45"
4,"Excellent Phone System - Excellent range, and features","Well, first to the reviewer ""m_night2"" from Savannah, who said you can use ""regular"" AA batteries in this phone... that is NOT true. The manual explicitly says that you CANNOT do that, and that the batteries must be NiCD or NiMH rechargeables. This is probably the reason he had trouble with his phone, because regular AA alkaline batteries are different voltage and milliamps than NiMH rechargeables. Use the right batteries and these phones work great.The features are well thought out - everything is controllable from the handset. One nice thing is that you can pick up your messages from ANY handset. And you can set options from any handset. One of the dissapointments is that the phones do not replicate the directory from handset to handset, so you have to reenter all the names and numbers in every handset. (I really didn't expect that to work, but I was hoping.)Great buy overall."
1,Did not Play at all,This CD which came packaged in the plastic wrapper did not play at all. I did not contact the seller because I only spend about $5 but I was not happy with the purchase either.
1,Pages of nothing,"This book didn't hold my attention at all. I felt the author droned on about nothing. I am a avid reader of this genre, and feel this is the worst book of it's type that I have ever read."
2,"Nice try, Mr Olsen","hate to be rude, but the book was pretty terrible. the author talks about how the guy gets all these beautiful women, but never makes him seem the least bit appealing. he stated the facts, sure, but never made it seem believable. more like a bad thriller than a true crime."
5,good stories and good humor,"No one tells stories like Mr.Clower.I saw him at fair a few months before he passed away and I got to meet him and even have his autograph.His stories are great,and funny.This is a good introduction to Jerry Clower.Only flaw is the sound quality of the disc isn't that great."
2,Insomniac's creation RUINED,"Spyro used to be such a fun game, that is when Insomniac still made them ( I could safely say the old Spyros were some of the funnest games I've ever played). After the last Spyro game (Spyro Enter the Dragonfly by Universal) things have certaintly gone down hill, There were so many glitches, gameplay was HORRIBLE, and the story was STUPID. So I urge you, innocent buyer, do not be fooled by apperences."
3,Suffers on CD,"This was an excellent LP, but suffers aurally inexplicably on CD. Go for the 20-track ""Very Best of"" for single-disc buyers or the much-recommended mondo ""Celebrate"" set for committed fans. Leave this one in the land of fond memories."
4,What's here is good,"This collection is getting a bad rap. It is a good, but incomplete collection. It is a re-issue of the vinyl lp from 1976, so it only includes 14 songs. 13 of which were big hits, the only miss being ""I Be So Happy"" from the Hard Labor album. But I would recommend you pass on this and buy ""Complete Hit Singles"" which includes all 21 top 40 hits on a single CD."
1,No pictures for critical steps,"I purchased this book to learn HOW TO ATTACH CLASPS. Well, there are NO PICTURES to go along with the step by step instructions. I am a total NOVICE at this, and with all the great reviews I figured this would be the ONE BOOK to get ... no. I still have no idea how to modify a necklace on a leather cord to attach a clasp. If anyone can offer any help, I would appreciate it. But I would not buy this book if you don't know how to attach clasps."
5,Great Book,"I am new to beading and found this book to be extremely helpful and informative. It takes you through basics, explains all the terms and what the different components are that are used in beading. This was well worth the money!"
3,A lot of features,"I was trying to find a good cordless phone from the internet.I have received the 4210 phone yesterday but i couldn't use it outside the house ... it can only be used in an area of 70 feedsThe phone has lots of features that made it desirable to me. Its small size, appearance, and voice quality are all excellent. The phone has many features and requires the user to spend some time reading the manual to figure them out. The voice dialing and voice announcement are excellent.In my opinion the only disadvatage is the signal ... I live in Cyprus and i don't know why i can only use it on one floor only ..."
1,"We say it can, but we couldn't do it...","This phone is a technical nightmare. It has so many features that it is overly complicated. Just picking it up could send it off to some menu that takes a rocket scientist to figure out how to get out so that you can use the phone. The most frustrating part is the one simple thing that I wanted it to do, announce the caller from the base station. I checked the manual to make sure it would do this before I bought it and it states very plainly that it can. But after two hours of trying to make it work, I called Siemens customer service and they said, ""It was supposed to do that, but we couldn't make it work."" I wanted a phone to work as a phone, not this techno-nightmare that does way more that needed, and not what is needed. Also, the phone's voice dialing feature failed after I used it three times. Rubic's Cube has nothing on this phone."
3,No wall mounting capability!,"If you need to hang your phone on the wall, save yourself some trouble and buy another brand - I had to return it. Otherwise it looks like a great unit, probably one of the best on the market. It is just frustrating to see such a basic flaw in an otherwise very good product."
1,"Poorly thought out, and numerous bugs","We owned the Gigaset 2400 and liked it quite a bit. Since that phone went out of production, we decided to ""upgrade"" to the 4210 (and we bought 3 extra handsets, too!).We really wish we hadn't. The phone user interface is very poorly thought out, and seemingly simple tasks often are exceedingly time consuming. Worse, we've found numerous bugs in the phone - the time-clock loses about 3 minutes/day and is NOT reset by the caller-id time; transfering phone #s from one handset to another is buggy; reception is clear 90% of the time, but 10% of the time there is much ""clicking"" interference; placing a call on hold usually hangs up instead; and interactions with voicemail systems is mind-bogglingly bad."
3,"good quality, poor UI","I was looking for a very clear, reliable cordless as I've always had back luck in the past. The Siemens has far surpassed all other cordless phones I've tried over the years (probably 5 others of various makes, etc.) But the menu system, phone book and overall UI is cumbersome, slow to use and sometimes counterintuitive. Sometimes I seem to get stuck in some mode where I have to hit End before I'm able to press 'talk' and dial. The user interface seems to be a sad knockoff of the Nokia cell phones. Stealing the Nokia UI would have been a much better idea. Overall the signal and sound quality of this phone is very good."
3,a very essentiall book for the scholars,"When I first began writing my MA thesis on The Flower and the Leaf and The Assembly of Ladies,I had difficulty in obtaining the original book prepared and edited by Pearsall in 1962. I got it by chance from an american scholar who recently studied on the texts and finally I had the 1990 edition.In this respect, it is an essential book for the academic studies on the texts but I should admit that comments and the background information by Pearsall are much detailed and valuable in 1962 edition whereas the introductions to each poems are only 2 pages in the 1990 edition. The background information and the traditions should be expanded in my point of view. The Isle of Ladies is an asset in the recent edition but it is still vital for lovers and scholars of medieval literature"
1,Score Pad for Chicken Foot and Mexican Train,"Be smarter than I was if you order this score pad!! My family loves the Chicken Foot and Mexican Train games, and we had used up our score pads. I thought it would be a fun little thing to add on to another purchase I was making on Amazon, so 'splurged' on the $4.88 score pad. I was astonished when UPS pulled up with a good sized box from the game company. The box was 12 x 12 x 5, stuffed with paper, and lost inside all that space was the little pack of 5 x 7 score cards. I *should* have not been in a hurry that night and taken more time to notice it was not included in my free shipping items. So just be smarter and know that it will cost you $9.12 to have this item, with shipping almost equal to the cost of the pad itself. With 50 sheets on the pad, it is almost 20 cents per sheet of score card. Not very 'green' to have UPS come deliver a box for an item that weighs just 3 ounces and could easily fit in an envelope. Won't make this mistake again!"
3,Ford maintenance manual,"I have used chiltons books for many years for different model cars and motorcycles. Do you also provide a CD with maintenance manuel type information. At our local auto parts dealer I've seen CDs maintenance information. I understand from the store employee that the CD is much more comprehensive and has better pictorial details. I'd like to get some more information on the CD. Thanks, Eli Elias"
3,Better than a sharp stick in the eye,"I spend all winter reading gardening books. This book was disapointing. Its format is small. I like a nice big gardening book. Its information was sufficient, but it was not impressive. I am not sure I would have bought this book if I held it in my hands before I purchased it."
1,funny indeed,"Wrote Joe Nye : ""Alexa led me to the bed in the middle of the enormous room and pulled me down beside her. I kissed her breasts and ran my hand between her thighs. She gripped my shoulders tightly. Unlike the first time I made love to Alexa, when the ecstasy had been eroded by a sense of anxiety and uncertainty, I was sucked into this moment as quickly and completely as if I had placed my feet in quicksand. Memories from years ago blended with intense physical excitement in a driving, pounding torrent of passion.""Ridicule does not kill, but it can definitely lighten up your day!"
3,Fun Fluff,"If you are looking for something to stimulate your brain, this isn't it. However, if you are just looking for a good laugh, you'll enjoy The Bad Girl's Guide. It's funny and light, and definitely a good way to pass a little bit of time."
5,amazing!,"great advice for all ages, definately worth reading! it really is the bad girl's bible, and can be applied to every aspect of life."
1,OK I giggled....,TWICE in the whole book. It is a cute book but not really funny nor usefull in anyway...unless your 18 then you might get away with some of the stunts in here. I think I found 3 fairly good tips other than that I was done with the book in under an hour and can't wait to get rid of it.
4,Laugh Out Loud Funny,"Belleluv had it right. Hilarious if you get and enjoy Cameron Tuttle's sense of humor. This book never fails to make me laugh.Just the chapter on being bad at work alone is worth its price.Just thinking of doing some of these things to my boss makes the stress melt away.Every girl whether she acts on it or not. Can be a ""bad girl"" at heart and celebrate the power of being Baaaaad!"
4,Great Flash Drive,"This flash drive is very good, it is a solid and nice sized flash drive. I bough one of these a while ago and am very happy with it. The only problem I've had with it is that the plastic drive, came out of the rubber casing when I was pulling on it one time. It stays in nicely, and doesn't ever come out unless I really pull hard. I use this flash drive on windows and mac and never had any problems with the drive. It's not the fastest, but its cheaper than many others so I can't really argue with the speed. Want faster speed, then buy a different drive."
1,UUUGLY!,"If you dont mind the appearance, its a big capacity, though time will tell if centon has gotten any better, they used to be bad"
1,Garbage,"These drives are a total waste of you money, run as fast as you can from them. Mine went out in the GARBAGE!"
1,Data Sport Stick 32 GB,"This product is an absolute rip off. I would not recommend this product to anyone the 32GB, 128 GB, or any other product made by Centon. The product should not even be sold on Amazon. If you want to get ripped off please buy this product. I have paid for two of the sticks and neither one worked. The data I transferred was all kinds of screwed up.Centon 32 GB DataStick Sport Waterproof USB 2.0 Flash Drive DSW32GB-003Centon Electronics DataStick 128 GB USB 2.0 Waterproof Flash Drive, Black (RCDSW128GB-001)Centon 32 GB DataStick Pro USB 2.0 Flash Drive DSP32GB-001"
2,Nice design but very slow,"Seems like a good solid external design, but painfully slow device. Unacceptable quality in a pretty package."
5,Awesome is an understament,"How I came to know of Mending Point is kind of funny. I was a roommate in college with one of the band mate's brother. We were discussing music and how I liked Alternative. He then asked me did I know of a group called ""Mending Point."" I didn't, but to save face I said I did. He knew I was obviously lying. He then continued to drill me with questions until I cracked and admitted that I didn't. He explained that it was his brother's band and that they were fairly new to the music circuit. He played me their self-entitled debut album ""Mending Point."" I found it to be awesome. The vocals are rich with meaning, blending wonderfully with the percussions and acoustics. I love this album immensely. I have a mind to get there other album ""Sincerely"" which is currently on sale at there site www.mendingpoint.com. Thanks Jeffy B."
4,ONLY CERTAIN CD-R BRANDS!!!!!,"Well, I'm only 23 but I agree that the display is too small, but industry-typical. I actually can't find the manual, and I never read it so I have no idea whether it was useful! However, the seller I dealt with gave me this hint: This recorder ONLY works with Maxell, TDK or FUJI medias, and the other brands will not work. Who knows why. That might explain the wasted time/CDRs of the other reviewers. I have no idea if it is stated somewhere in the manual, or if it is insider-music-people common knowledge, or what. Personally, I've only used Maxell CD-Rs and they've worked just fine, every time. I haven't had to deal with RCA, but the factory warranty is there for reassurance. This machine does the job (when I use an acceptable brand of media) and I doubt you'll find anything closer to a pro-quality recorder at such a good price. I've had no durability problems. The plastic makes it light and more portable ... Heck, most of my car is plastic anyway!"
1,Junk,"I don't remember where I bought it or how long ago, but it worked fine when it was new. A short time later it would only work some times and after that I was lucky to get it to work. To bad, because I really liked it. I finally threw it away and I just use my computer to make CDs now. I'll be glad when CDs and DVDs are obsolete."
4,"I like for the author, not so much the designs","Anne Orr was a great designer who moved the women's movement forward in a fairly pedestrian but important way: she was one of the vanguard of needlework designers who finally wrested control from the men. She was Good Housekeeping's editor for 21 years and created thousands of designs. This book has over 200 of them. She was really big on filet crochet but any counted work can incorporate her designs. See the very similar Dover book:Favorite Charted Designs of Anne Orr, Including 119 in Full Color (Dover Needlework)They would go well together"
1,Bad product,"This is an extremely poor product - especially considering the high cost. Every time we lose power (electrical storm, etc), the unit stops working and it takes forever to get the connection back. I would not recommend this product at all."
3,Invader,"This was a science-fiction story that was boy and girl break up, alien finds girl, girl saves alien race and boy gets back girl.It was a very nice story with unexpected twists and turns. It was very well written, recognizable leads, and nice special effects. At a few places it actually made me cry. I liked it!"
4,Great stand,"Nice stand, very expandable with adjustable length. top shelf could use to adjust a bit higher but is ok if youre sitting down. We use ours for keyboard on bottom and syn on top."
4,GREAT!... except...,"This stand is super great. Very sturdy! One minor thing that almost went wrong though. Before I bought it I read the reviews and I came across a complaint that the tier arm holder was warped so it wouldn't fit. I thought that that was one in a million so I made the purchase anyway. One tier fit right in. The 2nd tier not so much. Though eventually I got it in, I had to bang and wiggle the thing for a good 5 minutes because it was slightly warped. Then I barely made it fit. So buying this, you are taking a bit of a chance. I hope the customer service is good."
2,Not recommended,"This book is NOT a good book for an advanced violinist, as the othr reviewer suggested. Mr. Bronstein dictates how these masterworks should be performed by tediously describing each measure of the music. It is impossible to teach music of this level by explaining how to play each note. Ridiculous!"
4,Great for back sleepers,"This pillow is wonderful esp if you are trying to sleep on your back. Definitely not the best for a side sleeper, but it has helped me be a better back sleeper. Yay!"
1,Poor quality,The recorder that comes with this book is of very poor quality and can never be played fully in tune. A student would have trouble distinguishing a dissonant from a harmonic tone.
3,Not like the pc game,"I love to play the age of empire games on the computer so i was really excited when i got age of empires age of th kings on ds. Sadly it is nothing like the age of empires for the computer. The game itself is...ok, as long as you dont expect it to be like the computer verisons. The graphics of the game where bad and in the begining the game was very compilcated and annoying. But once you learn how to play it could be fun i guess. The game is very hard to get into and could have some inprovements."
5,Love this stuff!,"Vigo does a good job of balancing spices with the beans and rice. I could eat this stuff every day. I feel it's also good for me, giving me protein without a meat product. Try it, you'll like it."
5,Help ideas for getting back into nature,Very useful book on practicing mental discipline in a fun adventurous way! Many ideas of how to practice this great mental discipline without it being drudgery!
3,Who sends you only one wristband??,"I've got no problem with the wristband. In fact, I'm wearing it right now, and it is as advertised. The only thing is I was expecting to get TWO wristbands. It's a good thing that I only wear one at a time, but I was expecting to have a backup. It's almost like sending someone just one sock. BEWARE, they don't send a pair, just one wristband!!! So, if you want two, you've got to double your order."
1,"Disappointing, to Put It Mildly","This novel, like (alas!) so much Christian fiction, simply doesn't ring true, specifically in the areas of realistic dialogue and situations. Some church friends of mine recommended books by this author, and being an avid reader of science fiction and books on current technology, I thought this would be the right book to start with. Sorry, but this just didn't click for me, maybe because I never really connected with the main character at all, and, as already noted. the author has a problem creating realistic dialogue for her characters."
5,Breaking the sedentary Inertia,"Hi Fellow Readers!I'm currently reading this book now, but I would like to share some initial thoughts with you.First of all the fact Dr. Colberg mentions, that you can be overweight and fit. This is very interesting because you set your focus to having a better Blood Glucose control and being healthy not just losing pounds.I have always been a very sedentary person and the approach she has on step 2 ""Get up and Get Moving"" and afterwards on Step 3 ""Become even more fit"" is a natural way to begin and increase your activity levels.I'm an avid searcher for better ways to take charge of my diabetes, to live a good life, and enjoy the love of my family!!This book seems to fit me perfectly as a ring, on all the important issues ""empowered people"" can do to personally collaborate with our Health Team."
4,Informative,Lots of information that is useful to anyone who has or is interested in the needs of a diabetic.
4,Beware of using glue,"This was a great alternative to stainless and a lot less expensive. They did cut easy, but was a lot more time consuming to put up than I thought.I word of warning though........ I put them up with constuction glue like a lot of the reviews said, but I discovered that after they dried the glue had shrunk and dented the tiles. I put a dab in the corners and one in the middle, and you can see every spot. The remaining tiles I filled in with glue and they seemed okay when they dried.If you are going to use the glue I would suggest all or nothing."
5,Awesome stuff!!!,"I was skeptical about this product, but it is utterly awesome!!!!! I used mastic and liquid nails to ensure it wouldn't budge. It looks fantastic in our large kitchen, and it compliments our 1x1 mosaic backsplash beautifully. Don't be fooled by the low price... It looks like a million bucks!!! I would highly recommend!"
1,The Art of Dreaming,"Reader, BEWARE of Castenada and his suggestions. He is a sorcerer. It is imperative that readers of this book balance the content against other compelling perspectives, e.g., DREAMS by KALLMYER is an excellent book which provides a scholarly, yet practical view that is sure to challenge the reader."
4,Watch Chest,I haad to upgrade from a ten watch and this one has a very good finish on the cabinet and the see thru lid is the perfect touch.
5,Burlwood watch storage chest box,"The Burlwood watch storage chest box that hold 20 watches was absolutely beautiful. My husband loved it. Thank you very much. I will be watching more items to do business with you again in the future.Thanks,Veronica"
4,Nicer than it looks!,Very attractive with a nice finish. I ordered two different watch boxes and my husband chose the other one with a better key lock and sturdier craftsmanship. I would still recommend this one if saving money.
4,Odd flaw,"Disc number one of this release had a really strange flaw: depending on how I accessed the cuts, sometimes there would be no audio. It was like the audio file just didn't load correctly or something. At any rate, there was no problem in returning the DVD, but because it was from a private seller, I couldn't get an automatic replacement. I did get credited for purchase, but because to get it replaced, I would have had to order from the same dealer, I opted instead to buy directly from Bonamassa's site.Great DVD, great performances though."
5,"Awesome, my favorite.","I chose this because my wife and i are flying to New York in May to see Joe at the Beacon, i would recommend this to any music lover."
5,great,Saw this on GPBS and bought it for a mutual acquaintence. Wish I would have kept it. Joe is a great blues guitarist.
4,Good concert,But live from royal albert hall i much better. nice to have in my collection but not my favorit blu ray
2,Disappointing,"Joe is obviously an excellent musician, his guitar pyrotechnics are only matched by a very few. That said, I expected much, much more from this DVD than I got. First, the audio was slightly muddy, an inexcusable happening with the technology available today. Then the video was fuzzy and colors washed in strange ways, probably because of stage lights, so I'd give that one except I've seen many with colored lights on stage that didn't mess up the video. Finally, Joe himself. When he sticks to the guitar, he's fantastic, but you can't watch a couple hours of that without songs attached. There are about 3-5 good songs on this DVD, and 2 of those are by his guests! His vocals are slurred, muffed, and unfathomable. The songs themselves, other than the handful mentioned, are just plain boring. If he'd hire a songwriter and a singer, he'd be much better off."
3,Not that great,"The manager mode is pretty cool, but the overall gameplay is not good. The AI in this game is very bad, with your players often doing nothing to try and control the ball unless you control them yourself. The goalies are also terrible. The menus are also not very good in the game, as you will often have to click on a button several times before it responds. If you just want to use the manager mode and simulate the games, this is the game for you. Otherwise, don't waste your time."
2,Run Through The Jungle!...,"WOMEN IN CELL BLOCK 9 is Jess Franco's soft-core film for sadists. Women are captured as ""terrorists"", stripped, tortured, and escape to run naked through jungles and swamps. Actually, it's all fairly dull stuff, unless certain orifices gushing fake blood is your thing. Yes, there are some beautiful women in this movie. No, I probably won't watch it again..."
2,good...for a while,"I bought my stereo in 2001. It worked fine (noisey when disks change as noted by other reviewers). I used it fairly regularly until 2003 when it went into storage. I recently pulled it out and within a couple weeks it is no longer working. I can only play disk 3. I can't change disks, I can't eject disks. If I power the unit down it still only likes disk three when I power it back up. This is most disappointing since the size/look of the stero is so great with the location for it in my home. Also, I have no idea how I'm going to get my CDs out. Now that I've decided that the stero is truely broken I've tried prying it open to get my disks but no luck so far."
3,Made in China ...,"Set is beautiful.Sound is good.But, my CD player broke down, it just does not change the discs, makes a lot of noise but no useful action.Looked for RCA assistance and did not found.I was not able to find repair parts or a substitute unit.Can anyone help with indication of RCA assistance? I live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and have a daughter living in Mexico City."
1,Too simple for those who know!,"If you know anything about computers, software and peripherals, i.e., what they look like and what they do - don't buy this. This book has nice illustrations but very little text. If you wanna' learn about pc's, buy books with detailed info, better yet, use a computer. You don't need this book to tell you the advantages of portable computers - easy to carry around. Or the difference between a single-sided and doubled-sided disk - self explanatory. This is for someone who knows nothing about computers. It's really simple."
1,Don't Buy this phone!,I've bought two of these phones and the base is defective. Both times the base went dead and Siemens would not fix stating that it was and act of god(power fluctuations). The second time I purchased I owned the phone less than 60 days!Siemens customer service Sucks!
2,Not a better handset than the 4000 for the 4015 base station,If you have a 4010 or 4015 base station you can't use voice dialing. The Screen is harder to read than the 4000 because they chose to use white characters on black background for some of the text. It doesn't have a headset jack. The buttons are smaller.The only reason to buy this handset for a 4000 series base station is if you need a compatible speaker phone. Otherwise save some money and stick with the 4000.
3,More for the amateur than the pro. Flawed but useful.,"I think I can simply sum this one up like this:If you think the Photoshop ""wow"" books are absolutely your cup of tea and are great, then this book is a clear sure-fire winner for you.If you think the Photoshop ""wow"" books are trickery and contain a few things worth picking out of a bunch of stuff you'll never use, and maybe you think you'd like to get deeper into the art of retouching instead of a quick-tip book, then skip this one entirely.Personally, I got a few good pointers out of here, but I'd take Katrin Eismans book on PS Restoration & Retouching over this one. But again, I prefer that type of approach, some of you might prefer Scott Kelbys, especially is you are more the amateur to advanced amateur and not really interested in the finer points of this subject. It really does depend on what exactly your intent is (whether to just get quick tips or actually learn how to retouch.)Somewhat recommended, dependent on goals."
5,"Brother_Ike , You're a moron!","One of the best hip hop albums, EVER! Don't read bad reviews from haters like Ike, have a listen for yourself."
5,Gangstarr is the best,"This is a great CD. Premier comes out strong and Guru puts out great lyrics. The beats are hard and Guru and Premier keep it together throughout the entire CD. There are strong guest appearances as well (Most notably, Big Sug). If you like rap, buy this today."
2,Slippery when wet (or dry)!,These shoes are comfortable for new shoes but man are they slippery! I nearly killed myself walking in my kitchen and bathroom. They are EXTREMELY slippery on linoleum and other similar surfaces. BE CAREFUL!!!
2,better than cardboard,"For a real pianist, the keyboard offered limited help as a practice tool on the road. Hard to negotiate without the elevated black keys. Would be better if shifted down an octave, since those highest notes are not so useful and sound progressively more electronic/less real as they go up.In addition, the seller did not respond when I emailed immediately after receipt to let them know that one note was not sounding."
1,"Two books, one ISBN","Unfortunately, ""Speed and Politics"" shares an identical ISBN with ""Remarks on Marx"" by Michel Foucault, from the same publisher. Hence, the confusion in the customer reviews."
4,Perfect little weekend read,"I enjoyed this one and will probably pick up the other two as well. Light reading, but not light on intrigue, suspense, and availability of suspects."
3,Have to have it to network my printer.,"This is the second one of these I've had. My HP 1220C (heavy duty color inkjet with 11x17 capacity) won't work properly with any other printserver I've tried.This server works, but seems to lose its settings 2-4x/year as did its predecessor which simply died on me one day.So am I a happy customer? Mmmm well it does manage to work, and nothing else does, so captive audience."
4,Beautiful Scent,Ordered Today a few months back after recieving a sample of it.I loved it and I ordered it and it is a beautiful scent.What I like is that you can really smell the gardenia in it.Scent lasts all day.Bottle is very pretty and the style fits the scent.
3,Not worth the money,I purchased this bag one month ago when my baby was born and the zipper broke so I took it back. After replacing the bag with another of the same kind the stiching is beginning to come out of this bag. Your only paying for the Bauer name however it does compliment the travel system nicely.
3,New Mommy from Texas,"I got this bag as a gift when we packed for the hospital the zipper broke on it so we went back and exchanged for another one and it did the same thing so we got another bag and it has done great so far.It is just an hassle to go and get a new bag everytime it happens you pay money to get good qaulity and it does not even stay together,But it is a good bag to take on trips it holds alot of things that you need for the baby."
4,Excellent product,I bought this product based the reviews of Amazon customers. This product works great from anywhere we play within the TV room. It is truly a great purchase that allows you freedom to move around and play cordless. I see no advantage to playing with a corded controller and I am going to buy another wavebird. I highly recommend this product.
5,Good controller,I bought this so I could keep my gamecube behind a glass door. It works great (as long as you don't accidently move the channel dial on the controller during play). Works just like a standard contoller sans rumble. Glad I bought it.
4,The Connection,"You wouldn't know it from the cover (which makes it look like a strictly music video), but this is the 1962 Shirley Clarke film based on the Living Theater's production of ""The Connection,"" with a screenplay by the playwright, Jack Gelber. Not only did Gelber write the screenplay, but actors from the original stage production include Warren Finnerty, Jerome Raphel, Garry Goodrow, Carl Lee, Henry Proach, and Barbara Winchester, as well as original musicians Freddie Redd (composer, piano), Jackie McLean (alto sax), Michael Mattos (bass), and Larry Ritchie (drums). So I imagine that this is a pretty authentic adaptation of the play.I think it is a fine, interesting film, but have only given 4 instead of 5 stars because the video and audio quality is just ok. For those just interested in the music, the CD would be a better choice. However, watching the film is definitely worthwhile. Recommended."
4,Not bad,"This was a pretty quick read, though the story drug a bit here and there. It's really about a woman scorned, learning from a friend how those in the ""know"" can conspire to cheat you in a divorce. A lot of unnecessary/undeveloped characters but the overall story is clever. The author needs to read a few more Sue Grafton mysteries, but she's not bad, either. I'd like to see this character tackle a few more mysteries: she's likable and vulnerable, with the right amount of sassiness."
4,Another excellent Thompson novel,"4.5/5Although the plot of A Swell-Looking Babe is weaker and less dynamic than the plots of his best books, it still contains some of his most powerful writing. It's a tragic, Oedipal tale that totally immerses you in the bleak lives of its characters. They're people who remain sympathetic not despite their personal evils, but because they recognize the evil within them and hope to change. Because it's a Jim Thompson novel, change either comes too late or in the form of bullet to the head. If you haven't read any Jim Thompson, pick up Savage Night or The Killer Inside Me first. If you're already familiar with his work, there's no reason to hold out on A Swell-Looking Babe."
4,Save our Springs,"Good narrative, it seems a bit long in places but is very informative. I would like to see more movies like thison similar themes. MB"
2,Pritchard quicker to find fault than see benefits,"Pritchard leans a little bit towards being an armchair quarterback who sits back and criticizes the efforts and motivation of a church that has served America well. He does do a good job of explaining the technical side of how Willow Creek produces a service, but the book is dated and not entirely objective. I felt that at times he missed the heart of the leaders at Willow Creek. Don't judege Willow Creek by this book."
3,Triangle Metal Wall Tiles,Fun to do some undates with. Put them on your walls and ad a bit of new look to a room. Good product for decorating.
2,Not the best stainless steel wall tile,"I thought it would come in 3x3 foot sheets instead it comes in little triangles that make it very time consuming to install on the wall then it doesn't stick well to the wall. You find yourself constantly pressing the wall to make it stick. It looks nice once you are done, but they keep falling off the wall. Also since they come in little half triangles it is difficult to wipe down without either cutting yourself or having the tile pop off the wall. I don't think this product will last long as my kitchen back splash. I am just too tired and it cost too much to change it now. Maybe someone can tell me how to wipe it down without it falling off the wall or cutting yourself on a corner edge that keeps popping up and sticking out or how to keep it on the wall."
4,"Nice, But...","I received these tiles and they were cut down the center, dd anyone else receive them this way or was it just me? I bought double side 3M command tape and they still came off the wall after applying them. I ordered some more 3M tape, I'm hoping that this time around they stick on my semi gloss kitchen walls. Very pretty tiles never the less!! If applying to freshly painted semi gloss walls, please get some 3M tape that applies to walls or semi gloss walls otherwise you will have the same problem as me."
3,Not what I had hoped for,"This rocker seems like a great buy. The colors are very cute not too gaudy like some of the bouncers out there, and it seems to have some great features for a good price... However, It's on sale for a reason. The first one I received; the rocker did not work. I got another one hoping for the best. It seems to function okay but it is rather loud. It also sits up too high. My 6 week old still slumps over too much to see or interact with the activity arm. He's pretty fussy within ten minutes of being put in this bouncer. I'm keeping my hopes up that he'll learn to like it before he's outgrown it but he's already 13 pounds and this is only intended for up to 20 pounds, versus 25 like most other bouncers! Don't waste your money."
1,don't waste your money,"I was a bit disappointed with the chair because it sat too upright so we couldn't use it for the first 3 months. Also, every time he hit the bar, it would go out of his reach and he'd cry. Not a worthwhile investment."
5,love it!!,"I have been really happy with this product. The seat itself is very soft and it feels like it would be warm for her when she sits in it. The vibration works really well, and the arm is great. She is happy when she watches the stars light up and the music plays for a long time. The only thing that I do not really care for is how the seat rocks back and forth. It does not seem to calm or entertain her at all. She loves to reach for the mirror and play with the moon. She started sitting in this seat when she was just a newborn. It does sit up pretty tall, but it has never been a problem for her. I bought it because it goes with her nursery theme and I love it."
3,It's okay...,"I am a new Mum to twins and bought this bouncer, as an alternate to the two we already had, because we thought it would be soothing to our ""fussy"" daughter. Well, she didn't seem to care either way, but our son thought it was great. That was, until he couldn't activate the lights/music bar, once it stopped.He is three months old and pretty strong, but he can't activate the toy bar, and even I had to really hit it to get it going again. Additionally, 10 seconds of play before the child has to activate it seems very short.As others have posted, the rocking motion isn't the best (mine tends to rock more to the left), but we haven't noticed it eating up batteries."
2,sits too upright for newborns,"I didn't notice how much more upright the Delightful Dream Bouncer was than other bouncers until we assembled it, tossed the box away & attempted to use it. In other words, too late to return to the store. It was totally useless until our daughter was around 2 months old. I then realized that all the activity stuff comes up from the left side, and my daughter couldn't reach the play things with her right hand at all, which she tends to favor. Unless you have a left-handed newborn who can sit upright soon after they are born, this bouncer isn't a good choice. I highly recommend buying the Fisher Price Aquarium bouncer instead. My daughter LOVES it! You can use it right after your baby is born and it will definitely keep their interest!"
2,Not bouncing happy,"My husband and I purchased this bouncy seat for our newborn daughter. From day one, it has been a tremendous dissapointment. It has not worked properly ever since we bought it, only rocking to one side. The light/toy bar was too high for my daughter to see up until she was 10 weeks old or so.This product also eats up the batteries. I was not satisfied by any means and if I lived closer to Babies R Us, would have returned this product immediately."
1,don't waste your money,"ladies don't waste your money on this product. I am a large frame woman, I ordered the large sling and had a hard time getting it over my head. my husband who is 200 lbs also had a hard time getting it over his head. not to mention the pouch that is large enough to hold twins. do your homework!"
1,Very uncomfortable!,"Strains your neck. Can't breastfeed with it, akward with a newborn. Returned it a week later."
3,Hmm..what adjective to use?,"It was not.....riveting......I was not....mesmorized...I COULD put it down...But it was good....I am not sure how to explain. The story line was good, at times the story held me but I would not say it was like a MUST read....That said, a friend is passing me the rest of the books and I surely will read them..I mean they are not BAD...."
3,A great mystery with an ecological twist,"The first novel of the series - I don't know if this is Barr's first novel. A bit hard to get into at first, and I was confused who was who at the beginning (perhaps due to the author's sometimes using the characters first name in one paragraph, then switching to the last name in the next).BUT it was well worth it. Anna Pigeon is definitely an interesting character - I can't wait to race through the series to see how she develops!Plus it was definitely a break from the typical whodunit - Barr is a ranger and all the background info on the National Park Service is fascinating!"
4,Good!,"Nevada Barr is really the first mystery writer I've ever looked at, and ""The Track of the Cat"" is the first book I've read of hers. It's very good, and maybe a little old now since it was published in 1994. However, the time of publication does not matter in this case, for I loved the stark description of the national park where Anna Pigeon works. I enjoy her relationship with her psychologist sister who still lives in New York, and the unravelling mysteries surrounding the death of fellow ranger Sheila Drury and the disappearance of another male ranger. Unfortunately, the copy I had might have been missing some pages right near the end, so I don't know if I went through the entire story. Once again, read this and be enthralled with Nevada Barr's debut novel!"
4,Pretty Good Book,"I enjoyed this book, and love the Anna Pigeon books all of them, but I have a problem in that Anna is painted as such a strong and clear-headed woman, but then she's always attacked and when she is she turns into a senseless and weak idiot. She can't seem to figure out how to fight back till she's almost dead. She doesn't seem to have that ""fight or flight"" instinct ingrained in us all. But the story lines are always entertaining and i still love Anna :)"
4,Mountain lion framed,"A mountain lion is wrongly accused of murder in a Southwestern national park, and Anna Pigeon is a park ranger who sets out to prove who really did it. Great scenery and nature writing - very little humor (except for some banter with her Manhattan-dwelling sister). No more violence than is necessary to carry the story (but graphic descriptions of what wild creatures do to dead bodies in the wilderness). The best suspense scene involves Pigeon alone in a fall down a mountain slope to the edge of a precipice. Mild sex (M-F and F-F). There is political agenda ( females and tree-huggers are good guys, ranchers and hunters are bad guys, Christians are silly) but I didn't find it too intrusive. The final showdown action scene with the murderer was unconvincing, but these scenes almost always are."
4,"Quiet, Deadly Suspense.","Track of the Cat by Nevada Barr is unusual for a mystery because so much of story builds around Anna's introspection. Her thoughts set the rhythm and mood of this story as much as the desert landscape where it all takes place. Anna doesn't see things quite the way others do. They see two accidental deaths and a near miss. She sees murder and since nobody else sees things her way she's on her own. There are plenty of clues and even more suspects that leave you leaning one way, then another. The suspense is quiet and deadly and the ending a satisfying surprise."
1,Using Greek letters and acronyms does not make you a scientist.,"This book is typical of the more ""advanced"" literature on theoretical syntax - it's full of acronyms where a simple English word would suffice for what are in fact simple concepts if you get beyond the incessant jargon. Please can syntacticians stop thinking using Greek letters sounds cool. It doesn't. The book is certainly not ""core syntax"", and it is certainly not for beginners - not because the syntactic phenomena it does cover are inherently difficult, but because its is only more advanced students who would ever be able to realise ""oh he's talking about THAT when he says the theta-criterion EPP little v movement Merge whatever matrix theory"". Please. If this is Minimalism, then Minimalism is just another way of saying the SAME THINGS but using different Greek letters and a different type of tree diagram. If this gets you salivating then go ahead and buy this book and keep people in their ""jobs"". If not, don't."
2,Not a good introduction to Minimalism,"I am now a M.A. student of linguistics.This is the textbook we've used before and I think it is nota good idea to try to comprehend Minimalism well with thisone. A lot of details are missing and simply explained ina few words. Exercises in each chapter are also not clearlywritten. If you try to learn Minimalism well, JUST find someone better else."
1,This book is terribley written,"This book is definitely not for students with no linguistics background. The contents are not only difficult to understand but also are written without any organization. To be honest, the more you read, the more confused you are.I am also a MA student of linguistics and i found this book extremely recondite and full of tons of typos. Anyway, whoever has no background in syntax and is about to start with the latest minimalist program, this book is abosulately a BIG NO-NO!"
2,"Spacious, but poor quality","I bought this bag as well to match my stroller (Laura Ashley Canterbury - why didn't she make a matching bag?) anyway, I have used it now for 4 months...and there are stains all over it...I also use the Dr. Brown bottles and they leak. so now it looks about 2 years old the bag..also the lining inside the bag as well as one of the outside pockets is ripping right across...so I would not purchase this bag again..it does have its up side its very spacious, I can fit all the necessities and then some..I have the big tote and the small bag...the small is good to run to the store and that is about it..can't fit much more than a diaper wipes and bottle in it."
2,Not What I Expected!!!,"Pretty small bag. Looked substantially bigger in the picture. Bag measures in at a mere 11.5x11x6. Spent a great deal of time reviewing tons of bags. Bag's reviewers stated ample room for misc. items such as extra change of clothes, wallet,& cell phone, only to find out that's simply not the case. Specifically sought a messenger style(carry across chest)bag that my husband would feel comfortable carrying around and the strap is not long enough to go across your chest without it hugging your armpit. Quite the let down to say the very least!"
4,"Outstanding Material, Poor Delivery","I bought the VHS version of this dvd a long time ago. I had wanted a DVD version and am glad that I finally have it. When I bought the DVD, I didn't realize that it was the same because of the title. With the DVD, I am able advance to the shots I want to study more about.I gave this a 4 star rating because the production quality is poor. If the presentation and quality of the video were better, I would have given it 5 stars.The shots are advanced and many of them are useful. I am always amazed to watch the shots being executed."
2,Borrow a friend's copy,"Good for a couple of laughs but essentially one funny idea stretched into a hardcover. Something to page through on a plane, in the bathroom , or while waiting for the dentist but not much substance. Better yet - pick it up at your local bookstore read it over a latte and return it to the shelf 20 minutes later and you'll have the idea."
4,A Short Laugh,"A perfectly funny bathroom book. Enjoy it in parts, in whole, or in any order. Some of the chaptes are downright hilarious, others cute.After you put it down, you can ask yourself the following: ""I paid for this?"" You could have read it while standing in the aisle at Borders.Please don't get me wrong. Stanley Bing is brilliant and his Fortune columns are must-reads, its just that you need to accept this book for what it is. Its cute and cuddly. A potato chip of a book, not a whole meal."
1,Unfunny Scott Adams Clone,"You may get a few chuckles from this author, but to me he comes across more as an idiot than comedian. At least Scott Adams is funny as a ""self-proclaimed idiot"" who rips corporate America via his Dilbert cartoons and books. This book is somewhat like The Dilbert Principle with the funny parts removed."
2,ventilogquist doll,This was a Christmas gift requested by my 12 year old son. The doll is difficult & he picked it up once & has not played with it again.
5,Very Sexy!,"This bodystocking fits very nicely, hugging every curve. I have a small chest so it doesn't fit entirely correctly on top, but it still looks good and makes me feel sexy. Good quality for an inexpensive price."
1,Product not as described,I ordered these twice and both times they are the wrong size. I need to finish a backsplash and need the 4x4 tiles.
5,Loving my metal tiles,"My condo originally had the metal tiles, but they were scratched and old. Just by replacing them, my kitchen looks new. I love them because they are simple yet they look sort of retro. The project was so easy and took no time. If you like ""stainless steel"" theme in your kitchen, this will be the perfect addition, too. They come with two sided adhesive stickers. (The stickers may get old and may need replacement after a few decades.)"
4,Saramago Does it Again,"This book has a slow start, but the half-magical/half-practical world Saramago creates in this book is once again amazing."
1,It was awful!!!!!!,"Well, I found the style hideously annoying, Trying as I may to become immersed in the foul tyrades of peculiar literary structure, The proportions of which the monotonous, humdrum plot struggled along, only to frustrate, thwart, and impede the reader to derangement, Oh, if only I had wanted to read prose, and not the psychological, even metaphysical thriller as advertised and greatly anticipated, then by God I would have roamed the posey section of Borders Books, Anticipating sumptious amounts of long-winded, well read wordage,"
1,I got took alright,"From the previews this movie looks like it is an action packed thriller with a semi decent cast. Not the case. This movie is a major snore fest. There is action at the beginning and at the end. The whole middle and story builder part of the movie is boring as can be. This is supposed to be a story of revenge, but by the time you actually get to the revenge you are fighting to keep your eyes open. Watching Leguizamo have mood swings for 40 minutes straight does not make for a good movie. Also the glue on beard that Tyrese wears in the movie looks utterly ridiculous (LOL). The story is poorly written and never really develops. I guess they put the best parts of the movie in the trailer to fool the viewers. This is a really really slow movie. I would not recommend this movie at all."
4,All-natural relief from itchiness!,"I'm currently 39 weeks pregnant with my first and in the past three weeks I finally developed the dreaded stretch marks around my belly button. My sweet husband says they look like cat whiskers. :-) I had been lazy about using stretch mark products which I now regret. I actually rush ordered the Earth Mama stretch oil (which I never do) because I didn't want the marks to get worse and also because they are super itchy and uncomfortable. The 100% cocoa butter I was smearing on didn't really relieve the itchy ouch-factor. This product does! It glides on, smells earthy but nice, and gives a nice sheen to your skin without being excessively oily. And my stomach feels much better! I want to give the product 5 stars, but I haven't used it long enough to find out if it will prevent more stretch marks or help fade the ones I do have. Fingers crossed that it will. It also works great as a general moisturizer. I definitely recommend it!"
3,not great for morning sickness sufferers,"i have had morning sickness since i was five weeks pregnant (i'm currently 25 weeks). i started off using the burt's bees mama bee oil, but the lemony smell made me sick. when i found this, i was excited because i loved the smell - kind of citrusy and herbal. however..i can't explain why, but after only about a month of using it the smell of it started to make me sick, too. i wouldn't describe the fragrance as light at all, it's actually pretty strong, and i think that's why it started to make me sick. afterwards my clothes would smell and it made me feel very nauseated.i didn't notice a discernible difference in my skin's elasticity, either.maybe this is good for less sensitive mamas-to-be, but not for the morning sickness crowd!i've started using cocoa butter instead which has a much lighter scent."
5,a truely natural product that does what it says,"i used this with my first pregnancy and i didn't get stretch marks UNTIL i was in my ninth month, i was devastated, i really thought it was the end of my tummy skin. but i continued to use it faithfully and even still after my son was born. i had so many people say ""welp, there's the end of your bikini life!"" and all that other unfunny stuff that people with horrible stretch marks say cuz they want you to hop in their defeated boat. well, guess what? PRACTICALLY ALL OF THEM DISAPPEARED! yes, to my amazement, after only a few months, i could barely even see them aside from a little bit around my belly button, but they were so minor it didn't even matter to me. i am using this with my second pregnancy, headed towards my ninth month and i still don't have any. we'll see if they stay away, but even if i get some, i will continue to use it just like i did before."
5,Great,"I bought this product in my 7th month of pregnancy and already had a few stretch marks, so I can't say that it prevents stretchmarks. However, I can say that using this oil makes my skin feel really smooth and hydrated and I even think it evens my skintone. I apply it to my stomach before bed and leave my belly exposed to air to allow the oil to sink in. It relieves itchy skin that often comes along with pregnancy and in the morning my skin feels baby soft! I would highly recommend this product and wish I would have known about it sooner."
5,Best Stretchmark Oil!!,This stuff is awesome. I have been using ever since I found out I was expecting. I am due in 2 weeks and no stretch marks in sight! For being an all natural product you cannot beat the price. The smell is very soothing as well. I will be using this for my next pregnancy and I definitely recommend!
4,Wonderful,"this stretch mark oil smells so good. It lasts all day, even under my clothes. My skin is so soft. It isn't super oily. Just waiting to see what it does for stretch marks."
5,"Bought for my honey, and she loves it!","I found a similar product from CVS and found this better Strech Oil with less price, so why not buy on Amazon?My wife loves it very much and one bottle is enough for her entire pregnancy period, and what's more, she has no stretches at all! I am not sure whether this results from the oil but at least it can't do harm with stretch avoiding..."
2,Mama stretch oil,"The oil is nice, but the practically pornographic picture on the bottle is not nice! I will not be buying again for that reason. (Nor sharing with others) I would appreciate a ""family friendly"" advertisement. It took a while to get that sticker off."
2,unpleasant odor,"this smells like stale cigarette smoke. like an old, smoking-permitted hotel room. a smell i hated before i was pregnant, but with a sensitive pregnancy nose even more unpleasant. i don't want to waste it, so i use this on days where i don't feel nausea, and even then i have to breathe through my mouth while applying."
4,The Dark Side Of Football,"For Anyone Who Loves Football And Everything About It Knows Their Is Also A Dark Side Of The Game. Where Players Take Illegal Drugs To Help Out Their Game,Where Owners Will Do Anything For Their Team To Win. This Game Is Alot Like Any Given Sunday. Remember Win At Any Cost"
4,the colest thing,I like the game alot when I play It is like I'm the player.I think it showed have more than four stars.This Is the best game I'v played In my life
2,"Fun, if you can deal with waiting 12 minutes to start the game","The title says it all, this game takes 12 minutes to load and get to the point where you can play one player campaign mode. Havent timed the two player mode load time yet, but i expect it to be very close."
1,This game is not about football...it is novelty,"This is a novelty game. It you want a football game don't buy this one. There is no strategy involved in this one. It's all about the clash mode. You just go back and forth with one play touchdowns, boring. This game is more about the claps, which involves drugs, money and women. Oh, I forgot the cuss words. The use of foul language adds to the novelty of the game but adds nothing to the sport of football. I was hoping to find a game that could be substituted for Madden, but this was nothing more than a waste of money."
4,"The ""real"" NFL","Let me begin by saying this is NOT a game for children. What makes this game unique, and separates it from the Madden series, is the training camp option. Train your players, use steroids, and x-ray those bone crushing injuries.Overall, a pretty good sports game."
3,well......its ok,"To start off ive played all the blitz games before and Blitz;the league well... I though it was going to be better than what it was hyped up to be. If you have seen the videos for this game, the graphics look awesome. But the graphics arent as good as they look in the videos. The game takes about 2mins to load/save just for a simple thing. Theres no point for some of the cursing in this game and the clash mode is pretty cheap. If you want a fun blitz game get the blitz pro...thanks for listening"
1,No redeeming value,"This film is disgusting and has no redeeming value. Its not entertainment and there is nothing to learn here. The acting is mediocre at best and the story doesn't fully make sense and is morally bankrupt. Mostly I dislike this film because it uses for its own attraction value the very thing it proposes to demonize. All involved with this waste of resources should be deeply ashamed that they hadn't used their time, energy and money doing something better for the film viewing public. Skip it."
3,Nightmare Low on Extrapolation and Tension,"Novel in its approach, 'Untraceable' asks interesting moral questions about a plausible technological nightmare. A disgruntled man kidnaps select victims to torture and kill, adding more of a given hazard as the numbers of people log into his website. As his online broadcast is made known, FBI agents (headed by Jennifer Marsh [Diane Lane]) try to keep the situation under the radar and bloggers off the website. Savvy for obtaining a Russian domain for his website, the perpetrator renders the crew unable to pinpoint much less stop the website until they can locate him at his hideout. Sometimes a grizly update of Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Pit and the Pendulum,"" the film is often reminiscent of 'Silence of the Lambs' with eerie surveillance scenes. Somewhat cynical and far less tense, 'Untraceable' often remains more educational than entertaining. (2.5 *'s)"
2,So Disturbing,It seemed like an interesting concept for a movie but it was very disturbing. So intensely disturbing in fact that I had difficulties falling asleep after watching the movie!
2,Another dose of poison for our society,"This movie provides a look into the world of a very disturbed person who tortures people and displays this over the internet. Is this really something we all need to watch? Don't we have quite enough real life tortures of the human body and spirit going on in our world? Why is this considered ""entertainment""? It is sad to see in one generation how we have gone from the Turner Classic type movies (Clark Gable, etc, etc,) to movies where watching someone slowly tortured on a website is a possibility. Sure torture has been around forever, but it was never in my home and in my mind like this movie delivers. I regret having seen it."
4,Untraceable,A good thriller that is not for the whole family. I like it that there was actually a story to this movie. There was a reason for the killing and it wasn't just some crazy with a hacksaw buzzing through bodies!! Diane Lane does a good job with her acting. Everyone in Media should be given a copy of this film. There is quite a bit of foul language and some grusome scenes.
1,Horrible,"This item did not play well; it played like a bootleg dvd. I had to ask the seller for a refund. She responded quickly, and I was refunded in a matter of days. That is the only up-side to this transaction!"
5,it brings me back to junior high,"i have been a fan of pat benatar since her first debut and decided to get a colletion of her work. i picked up heartbreaker 16 classic performances and it is truly remarkable. a taste of her hits that brought me back about 15 years. if you ever go into a store and look at some CD's, be sure not to overlook Pat Benatar, a true legend and a must have."
1,theres only 1 devante,"how can anyone call this guy the real devante when devante swing of jodeci is the real deal devante. thats the problem today. the pioneers like devante swing, teddy riley, etc. get disrespected like there music didn't change the face of music today."
4,Great read for Boston area naturalists,"Landscape With Reptile gave me insight into the history of the relationship between rattlesnakes and New Englanders. As predators that pose a threat to humans teeter on the brink of extinction, its helpful to read a book like this and think about quality of life in a world without wildness, and how we can coexist with spectacular but potentially dangerous wildlife."
1,goated by Amazon.com,"I feel your pain Jose. I pre-ordered the game which was to include a free headset....got the package yesterday, and inside the BF2 box was just the head set, no damn cd's. Now i gotta return the friggin thing, and not get the head set. bang up job amazon...the 1 star is for them, not the game...i'm sure it rocks. will not pre-order through these gimps again."
2,Not a solitary game,"The graphics in this game are very impressive yes, as is the interface. I love being able to run buy double tapping forward. But the have left out game play for lan parties. I loved the original in Coopertive mode. 2 to 6 players could be involved in a great game, now you are limited to only online play with no bots availible in multiplayer (although there are bots in single player the single player mode is quite restricted). They teased you with a pull down menu for game play mode that contains only one type (conquest). If you are an avid online game player you will love this game. If you enjoy small lan parties your best bet is not to buy this game untill they patch it."
2,Ranking system sucks,"Graphics, details, vehicles, etc. are great.You start off with basic weapons on all classes.. you can unlock a weapon for each class starting at Lance Corporal. You start at Private, 0 points. Private First Class is 500 points, LCpl is 1000 points, Corporal 10,000 and it goes up insanely from there. You can expect on average 10-50 points per round although it's possible to make 100-200 if you're the scoreboard leader. Each round is about 15-20min. You do the math on gaining ranks. ;)You can only gain ranks on ""Ranked"" Servers which are hard enough to get into due to the lack of them (Host has to pay $5.50 per slot, so a 32 player server would cost the host $176/mo).If you're expecting to have everything available to you right out of the box, be forewarned that's not the way they designed this game."
4,I Change My Mind,"I previously criticized this game, but now that I had a chance to play Battlefield 2 for quite sometime, I agree that this is a fantastic game with enduring qualities. I still say their multiplayer interface is mediocre at best, but once you're hooked, it's a small price to pay. The best part of this game is that you can track your progress online to see how you match up against the world. There's great goals to obtain, including unlocking new weapons, receiving medals, and getting promoted. I earlier criticized the large map, but they have improve it since BF1942 in that you can re-spawn where your squad leader is so as long as he's not waiting to be spawned himself. This keeps you where the action is. The initial complexity of the game actually give great depth in ensuring not just hours of playing time, but months on end. Highly recommended!"
4,bf2,"ok so all iv seen is old reviews so ill post one. but at 8 bucks this was a easy choice for me to make. bf2 is one of the best games iv ever played. and its so old! lol. yeah its gets annoying sometimes when all you do is get raped by jets but overall its a pretty cool game to play. graphics actually impressed me quite a bit. again, there amazing for the age of the game! all i got is a 9600gso and i wouldent ask for any more."
5,Tenis 2K2 - Awesome,"A big improvement over Virtua Tennis. This has smother graphics and better playbility with swinging volleys, and trick shots between the legs. Starting out the world tour has a training mode where you create your own player. You can pick the look, hair style everything. My player looks just like me and I get to name him. You have a calender and you decide whether you play a tournament or train. You have to earn your ranking to get into a tournament. The playing is awesome. The negatives are the women are weak and not as fun to play as men. The whole women side is a waste. The second thing is that the ranking of a man player is based on singles, doubles, and mixed doubles. So You have to play all three to move up in the rankings. Training and playing slow matches with the women is sufferingOther than that the playability is awesome. I can't imagine a better tennis game on any console unless it had a better ranking set up on the world tour mode."
4,A Psalm For Falconer,"This is one of the best in the series! Access to some rare texts of Aristotle tempts Master William Falconer away from the petty intrigues of Oxford to Furness Abbey, near the shifting sands of Lancaster Bay. As usual, Falconer stumbles onto a twenty year old mystery that, to his dismay takes up his time that he feels could be more usefully spent reading Aristotle.I enjoy mysteries that allow the reader to appreciate the history and culture of the times; and this mystery is rich in both. The mystery is intriguing and the description of the treacherous shifting sands and the remote abbey adds to the fearful atmosphere. A truly enjoyable read."
5,"It is light, looks cute, and glides softly","It's lightweight, and thanks to its lightness and small rollers, it glides very softly on the road. It looks luxurious, but it's still as cheap as simple plastic rings. It's wonderful!"
5,I Bought the Couch!,"I remain an avid Bianchi fan, and this color photographic collection, Volume Two, goes one step further than Volume One. It is beautiful, but it is what some might call ""pornographic,"" as Bianchi has taken his photography up another notch. The collection is definitely not child's fair or a coffee table book, but it is a mature adult look at gay male sexuality for the bedroom bookcase. All of Bianchi's fotos are stunning and highly charged, erotic visual treats. I loved the leather couch and Tom's decorating choices so much that I now own a couch just like in the book. Weird huh? Now I can psychologically enhance the fantasies Bianchi has created. If only the men came with the couch!"
4,Definitive Donkey,I found this book very helpful. Iam a horse owner who recently became the proud owner of a baby donkey. This book was extremely helpful in teaching me how to care for this wonderful animal. It is simple and easy to understand. I would highly recommend it for anyone who has a donkey.
5,God is happiness itself,"The origin and ground and destiny of all human life is happiness itself. We live for happiness. This book shows how beauty is the indispensable guide and light to happiness.There is no human achievement or excellence that has not been motivated by the inspiration of beauty in one form or another.Within all the joy-giving experiences of beauty we know something of Happiness itself, or God.God is happiness itself.This book is great; and it makes me happy! It made me see how God is Beauty and Happiness itself. Wonderful."
4,CLASSY,This tuxedo shirt was to be a backup for my pleated wing-collar shirt but I loved the textured look so much I switched to it. This shirt fit and looked absolutely great with my Tux and I will default to it next time. It was a great choice!
4,Could you survive?,"I am sorry to see Phoenix Island is currently out of print. I have an old, worn copy that I have read at least five times. It's a story of survival by people who have nothing in common but their plight. A respected scientist and his wife, a criminal, an artist, a lawyer, and several other characters find themselves stranded on an island after a nuclear blast triggers a tidal wave. Their survival depends on them working together, to remember everything they may have forgotten they ever knew. It's an adventure, a romance, and a survival guide all in one. I've always felt this book would make a great movie. Stephen Spielberg where are you?"
4,Abolishing God to redeem the six million,"The book very vividly portrays the Holocaust, and juxtaposes the question: How can Jews go on believing in God after such an event? ""The Future Jew"" is extremely valuable for the very cogent manner in which it puts that question, but it is even MORE valuable for the document that lives and breathes at its center, namely the chapter entitled ""Holocaust Haggadah."" The Holocaust Haggadah tells the story of the extermination of the six million, and does so in the context of a Holocaust ""seder."" Marvellously written!"
1,cable does not fit GB advance,This cable does not fit the gameboy advance. We tried several times to contact the seller with no response. We went and bought another cable for our gameboy advances at the store. This cable listed does not have the right portals for gameboy advance.
3,Scent is too strong,"I bought this shampoo along with the matching conditioner and curl amplifier. My hair seems softer, but I don't know that my curls are any more defined than normal. And I am very sensitive to smells. The scent of all three products is very perfumy for my taste and sometimes gives me a headache. I'm going to finish the bottles because I can't return them, but I will be trying other curl products in the future."
3,Works ok,"I got some of this stuff and put in the trunk of my 2000 Honda Accord, with much exposed metal to be covered. It did improve the sound quality of my subwoofers, cutting down on that metallic sound it had before. It stayed on for about a year, but it fell off in the summer heat! I guess it is asking alot to expect adhesive to stay on bare metal, exposed to sun and probably heated to 120 degrees F. It also tends to dry out over time, but I guess that doesn't affect its acoustic properties. Overall its good at improving sound quality, not so good at sticking to hot metal!"
1,Dont believe the hype !,"My brother came home from school and rented this game. I was expecting something real good from all of the reviews I have seen. But I was very disappointed. The graphics look just like a dreamcast game, not up the PS2 expectations. The gameplay is really horrible, you can't even make a shot! If you have a Nintendo Gamecube like myself, go out and buy NBA Courtside 2002. it is much better than this game in every way. the only thing that i like in this game is the different street courts. this game is definately only a rent, not even a rent. dont waste your time and money."
4,Great game,"In my opinion, this is one of the best basketball games I have ever played if not the best. The graphics are amazing and the control play is a little difficult at first but you quickly get used to it. The only problem I had with the game was when it came to the season mode. I personally didn't like the way the game didn't save your season stats once you enter the playoffs which is a little disappointing after playing 82 games and having nothin to show for it. It also didn't give out awards for mvp,defensive player of the year,etc. This might not be important to you but it's just one of my little gripes. By all means don't let this information prevent you for buying this game because this is definatly the best basketball game of the year and a must have for any basketball game lover."
3,"Predictable, but enjoyable","Dr Mac Lloyd hates the idea of men cheating after marriage, and she's about to do something about it. To prevent her future husband from straying, she did research on male sexual fantasies. But the next step of her plan was to test her research and with the help of her best friend, Mac had a test partner in Lucas Wainright. There's only one goal for the both of them, to test the research without falling in love. But are feelings really that easy to manipulate?Knowing that this book is a Harlequin novel, I expected it to be poorly written with cheesy romance and no plot or character development. I was pleasantly surprised when near the end of the novel, there was little bit of an action subplot. If this book was published by some more credible publisher, I wouldn't give it 3 stars (maybe 1 star) but since this is Harlequin, and they aren't known for publishing bestsellers, I did give this book some credit for actually holding my attention until the end of the book."
5,YES ITS TRULY SILKY,Yes I love this product I order 2 at a time I love the combo pack that includes the shampoo!
4,Great new find for an old fan,"I've been a fan of Spirit since I first heard ""Dr Sardonicus"" back in the 70's but I dismissed this album because of Randy's absence. It was my loss! I'm older now and I've reached a point in my collection where I'm getting some of the music I left behind (I make more money now than I did when I was 18!) and truthfully I've picked up a lot of....well, not good albums. Feedback though is a great album. It's good rock, it's a believable direction for Spirit and SOUNDS-like a Spirit album. It isn't ""Sardonicus"" but if you are a fan of 70's-style rock/progressive rock and a fan of Spirit then this is an album worth taking a risk on; enjoy!"
1,Where are the love scenes??,"I struggled through this book waiting for the first love scene because all the reviews I read said that after the two main characters get together romantically, the book actually takes off. Great character development. Great interaction between the two main characters. But when they finally decided to get down and dirty (not until page 258, I might add), the whole scene was 4 lines long.I found NO character development in this book. I never even got the gist of main characters. To much conversation, not enough action. A very dull book."
4,Corbin Review,"Dear Mr. Matzner,I would like to commend you for your film ""Margaret Corbin, America's First Heroine,"" which I consider to be outstanding work. As a woman, I found it particularly interesting to learn about such a remarkable figure in our history, of whom I was not previously aware. Well done.Best Wishes,Allison Carhart"
1,No Contest...,"This game cant even tie John Madden's shoelaces. Graphically speaking, this game is slightly better at best (I like the replays on it though). Gameplay wise, this game [stinks]. In Madden you at least have to work to score and stop people from scoring, in this game you can seem to do either with your eyes closed (maybe I just got lucky in the games I played). Thankfully I only rented this game, and better yet it cost me nothing (I work at a video store)...if I had bought this game, I would have to take myself outside and jump out of a tree...P.S. - Seems as though this game lives up to the model set up by its coverman (Randy Moss), it cant make the play when it needs it most...LONG LIVE MADDEN, LONG LIVE EA SPORTS!!!!"
1,More Southern Whining,"This is yet another one of those one-sided crybaby Confedarate writings attempting to rewrite history and ignore facts. Did you know Davis was one of the most hated Confedarate leaders, and many Southerners blamed him for losing the war? No? Well, you wont learn that fact in this ridiculous piece of pro-slavery propaganda."
1,Selective quotation instead of facts again,"Anyone who's bothered to read the Federalist Papers or other documentation on early US constitutional history will notice that the Kennedys have presented a very odd view on the entire process. Any notion that states had more power than the federal government is mistaken. The central problem with the Articles of Confederation was an overly weak central government.I could go on for paragraphs but why bother? The Kennedys write books that have no relation to anything remotely resembling historical reality.Ignore the Kennedys, read the original documents and judge for yourself."
5,Justice for Jefferson Davis,"History has not been kind to Jefferson Davis. This is especially true now with the current wave of politically correct motivated attacks on him. The Kennedy brothers seek to rectify this by placing him under a mock trial charged with treason against the United States government. Incidentally, Davis repeatly asked for this trial which the U.S. government refused based on recommendation of their legal counsel.Most Davis critics know very little about him. An excellent biography introduces him to the reader. The Kennedy's present the questioning and motives of his federal accusers and offer a stalwart defense in his behalf. Decide for yourself if he was guilty or innocent of treason.Also, included in addendum are informative documents relative to the period and subject.When Jefferson Davis died in 1889 the South mourned. Thousands upon thousands of people of all races and walks of life attended his funeral and processions. The South still loved and respected their president."
5,More than a Clinical Review of Medication Options,"This book provides both the pros and cons of the many medications that a parent may be asked to consider for a child's mental condition--and also does an excellent job addressing the family and school dynamics of medicating a child's mind. Very sensitively written, a welcome feature after reading several other books that were far more ""cut and dried."" Roberts raises a number of points of which we were previously unaware."
4,Stunning album by a band that should have made it big.,"I recently dug out my SBM CDs after fifteen plus years and what a treat they are--powerful guitar work, pounding drums, chunky rhythms all layered with Bill Carter's apocalyptic lyrics. Totally Religious is the SBMs strongest album--and that's saying a lot as the others are well worth owning as well--with at least four knockout songs that stay with you: Four Engines Burning, Mega City 1, Wall of Shame and Big Big Sky. Any one of these tracks could have made the album stand out. Think Clash meet guitar rock with a hint of rockabilly. Terrific production, full and loud but not overdone. This is great stuff.""All we did was live and die, underneath the big, big sky."""
5,"BUY THIS FOR ""GRIPS, GRUNTS, AND GROANS""!!!!",PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER!!!! LUCHA LIBRE!!!! ITS AWESOME TO SEE THREE STOOGES INVOLVED IN IT!!!! SEE FOR YOURSELF!!!! YOU'LL JUST LOVE IT!!!!
3,buyer beware,Disc two has 20 minutes of advertising garbage at the beginning that cannot be skipped as the menu is disabled. Even fast forwarding takes several minute to get through all this garbage. And you have to do this EASH TIME you turn the disc player off. Very annoying and frustrating. The ads are for junk movies like Meatballs that have nothing to do with stooges.
5,Thank you Amazon.com!!,"This particular CD by Ryo Kawasaki is my favorite! When I finally found the original one I have, it was a little scratched and it skipped alot! I went from place to place requesting if it can be ordered..to no available..my daughter told me to try Amazon.com. I did and I received it and now I listen to it whenever I need to quiet moment for myself..Thank you Amazon!!"
4,Don't want to land in no Buzzard's Bay,Another great Jimmy Buffett album that's perfect for the backyard Barbeque.
2,Not the classic EWF sound,"I'm a huge EWF fan, but have been disappointed in the EWF albums with outside artists. It always seems to take away from the EWF sound that I know and love. If I wanted to listen to hip/hop or rap, I would buy it, but I don't. Any how many of the songs on this album have to refer to partying? The tradtional EWF lyrics have some depth and meaning."
4,The Better Thought-Out Passion,"Anyone who saw the Broadway production of this musical would have been amazed at the West End production with Michael Ball and Maria Friedman. This is actually a concert recording done after the West End run, but the voices soar!! While I remember the Bway production in shades of gray, with no color to speak of, The London production was filled with Light and energy, it was like watching a different show! And all that comes out on this cd! Buy it, please, buy it and experience the difference!"
3,Nice But Not As Effective As Original,"While the London cast does an admirable job, they just cannot compare to the triple threat of Jere Shea, Marin Mazzie and Donna Murphy on Broadway. Even though Maria Freidman is an amazing performer, she seems to be missing the desperation, passion, and particularly, the sense of doom that permeated every word and note Murphy spoke or sang. The same may be said of Shea, there was always a sense of tragedy about him. That just doesn't quite come across on the CD in Ball's performance.Nonetheless, there is still the wonderful Sondheim music, but I prefer the OBC."
2,London cast recording sucks !,"Vastly inferior to the wonderful Broadway cast recording. Both of the female leads in the London cast are not up to par as vocalists or as actors. Michael Ball gives a rather one-note performance with nowhere near the ""passion"" of Jere Shea. A travesty of a brilliant score."
5,I would recommend this CD,"I purchased two IVF cds and I like the voice of the woman on the this CD just a bit better, she has a very soothing voice. The CD has been great in helping me to relax through my IVF cycle, she uses some great methods that you can utilize even when you aren't listing to the CD to help with stress around the IVF cycle and in everyday life. I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone going through IVF and I plan on buying her other CDs when I get pregnant. This is my 3rd IVF cycle, 1st one using guided meditation. I hope it makes a difference, I will know in a couple weeks.Update, while I didn't get pregnant with my 3rd cycle either, I feel that this CD really helped to to relax and feel better during the entire cycle. I liked how there were different tracks for each phase of my IVF cycle."
5,A Graphic Novel for the Critic,"I remember first buying this in its first printing andthinking ""I've never seen anything like this in my life"".I went on a tear and bought as much Sienkiewicz art as Icould, from New Mutants to portfolios to a signed Moon Knightprint (yep, I met him too).Frank Miller of course is arguably the finest writer that comics have ever had. The combination didn't disappoint methen; news of a reissue means I don't have to risk openingmy original to re-read a classic.About the novel itself, I can only agree that as a story Millerhas written better, but placed in its context I believe it'sworthy of special merit. And again, to amplify earliercomments, Bill Sienkiewicz does something in this book thatshook comic artists at the time, breaking huge ground forthose that followed, and then... nothing. Inexplicably,Bill's presence went off the map. This stands as his finestwork in comics."
1,Definitely NOT the Good Book!,"This isn't the cartoonist's bible, its a nightmare straight from the pits of hell! An awful book. The author's style is horrible, and his ideas are worse than amateurish. There are so many good books on cartooning out there, to waste your money on this one would be an unpardonable sin!"
3,"Beautiful text, a bit confusing","I am using this text for a French class I am taking. When I first received the book, I was impressed with the beautiful illustrations and the information about France. Now that I am using it in a class I find that the speakers on the audiotapes go so rapidly that I often have to listen two or three times and then still do not always get what they are saying. I am not totally new to the language and can usually understand simple French if not too rapid. I also find the approach to grammar a bit confusing as it is not as systematic as I had thought it might be. Fortunately our intructor fills in the gaps for us in class. Without her guidance, I would not be getting that important information and would be a bit lost. If there were such a rating as 3 1/2 stars, that would be more what I would give this book."
1,"Battery died in 3 months, not covered under warranty","I purchased this watch for my mother and the battery died in 3 months. I am not sure if amazon had these watches for a while and therefore old stock, but Timex wants $10.00 to replace the battery and says it is not covered under any warranty. It will cost me more to send it for service. Overall a waste of $35.00. Next time I will purchase a watch from a company that will guarantee the ""entire"" watch including battery for at least the first year."
1,This was most likely written by the fool himself,"Rumsfeld is not only a disgrace to the American Nation, rather he is a disgrace to humanity and all that it stands for. Apparently the author fails to confront any actual news sources, instead taking tiny tidbits that the idiot Rumsfeld had accomplished (believe it or not, he was able to ""assassinate a terrorist""), and blows them to epic proportions, portraying Rumsfeld as some sort of mythical god. This book is a digrace to the American Nation. If the crap this author wrote is considered ""factual"", than apparently the War in Iraq is going just as planned, and believe it or not, the Iraqi insurgents love us! This book is absolutely disgusting. Resign Rumsfeld, resign now."
5,A great book about a great man,Rowan Scarborough does a great job. Don Rumsfeld is a tough old U.S. Navy aviator who does not suffer fools. He was one of the first people on scene at the Pentagon helping the injured on 9-11 after Islamic fanatics crashed the plane into the Pentagon.The negative reviewers from the UK and dead beat debtor Argentina are crazed lefties who would rather America allow Kofi Annan to protect are citizens. Rumsfeld does not want to negotiate with murderers like Bill Clinton & John F. Kerry-Fonda. Rumsfeld realizes this approach is a waste of time. Thank goodness America still has leaders like Rumsfeld.
4,I LOVED IT,I love the series what better way then to watch it on my kindle fire i just wished it was widescreen
4,Good item does the job right,"For the longest time, my car would squeak constantly whenever I had the air conditioning running or when making hard left or right hand turns. I replaced the tensioner and the belt twice to no avail, then I noticed my crankshaft pulley wobbling badly - the rubber between the inner and outer hubs was failing. After getting a repair shop price of $199.97 (yeah sure) I came to Amazon and found this item for 25% of the price. Fits perfectly, looks exactly like the original, and after so long the squeaking has stopped. One caveat on this item - the only reason it gets 4 stars rather than 5- is that the description says all bolts and washers are included. The crankshaft bolt is a Torque to Yield bolt, meaning it gets stretched when you torque it to its recommended tightness, and it should be replaced when you change out the pulley. No new bolt was included, just a warning for you to spend $5 and get a replacement if you buy this item, very easy to find."
2,"2 stars for really being ""clear""","I have used a number of different skins ranging in price and while this one is one of the cheapest, it's also the worst. The adhesive is not strong enough to remain stuck to the surface so even if you do remove any air bubbles, the overlay just pulls away after resting for a bit. I tried reapplying it a number of times with equal results.I wish amazon sold the Power Support Crystal Film cover set, that's the one i had the best results with."
1,Don't Waste your Money,"My little sister insisted that I read this book because she though it was ""cute."" So I decided to humor her and got through this vapid book in less than 2 hours. If you are looking for something light, fluffy, and unsubstantial, this is the book for you. The quixotic Carly Martin seems like a ""too good to be true"" sap and Max Giordano is depicted as the stereo-typical successful businessman. This book has reconfirmed my belief that romance novels, especially one of this low caliber is a waste of my time and my brain cells. I looked up the author and saw that she has a successful businessman as a boyfriend and I can't help to wonder if he paid someone to publish this book for her."
4,Long missing piece from the cd collection of an artist at the top of his craft,"At this point of his career, Zevon seemed incapable of releasing anything less than outstanding. If he were a basketball player, he'd be ""in the zone"". This album continued the irresistible mix of pop, rock, and quirkiness of ""Excitable Boy"" and ""Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School"" and became the bridge to the excellent ""Sentimental Hygiene"". One of the reviewers above referred to this as his third album. By my count, it's the fifth: 1) ""Dead or Alive"" 2)""Warren Zevon"" 3)""Excitable Boy"" 4) ""Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School"" and 5)""The Envoy""."
2,Too scenario based to learn anything,"I had to buy this book for a class and I do not recommend you purchase this book if you want to learn just the basics. It makes you go through scenarios and they do not always build on each other so there is a lot of rework. Also, you must read a lot before you get to actual instruction. Don't buy the book if you don't have to!"
1,Too scary for toddlers,"Thought this book would be cute for my little girl who loves the intro of Disneys Lion King movie. I don't allow her to watch the whole movie because it is too violent - she only watches the intro. However, just like the movie, this book contains images that are not suitable for young children. I really didn't expect such graphic images in a children's book, so this book will not be read to my toddler."
