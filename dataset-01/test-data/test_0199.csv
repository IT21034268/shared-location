4,Excellent quick tips and system for using Outlook,"This book is a very quick read and very useable. You can either read in detail and really understand Linenberger's overall system (based on GTD) or just dip in and get outlook optimally set up.The hardest thing I found about it is to implement this system when you have an executive assistant who also accesses your email. In this instance using Personal Folders as Linenberger suggests doesn't work since the other user will not see them or be able to file to them. Many of the tips in the book seem to assume that you are a lone user.However, overall I found the book very useful as a GTD fan and a new Outlook user. Quick and easy results."
4,I'm definitely More Efficient,I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning how to use Outlook to make your workday more efficient. It provides a great foundation for other ides to grow from as well. Finding past e-mails is a breeze so I don't print as many for filing as I had in the past.
5,Well-written and useful,"This is an excellent book. I appreciated the first edition, but, as with most of the task management systems I've investigated, it really didn't work for me on a practical, day-by-day basis. I found myself beating myself up for not following the system...one more task that I wasn't getting to.What he lays out in the second edition is a very different approach, one that works well for me. It seems to match the way my brain approaches daily and longer-term tasks. Highly recommended!!"
5,Heroic,Great collection of both albums. Incredible music that influnced generations afterwards. Excellent liner notes about the creation and effect of the release.
3,"Good, but not great","This is a great collection of songs. I specifically bought if for A Boy Named Sue, but while live, this version sounds hollow. (it echos) There is a better version out there."
4,Great book!,Loved this book! Very easy and fast read. Lots of information to make sound judgements and decisions. Highly recommend it.
3,HA,Bought this and it doesn't work. What a waste of time. It offers no insight in to anything. I am so sad for wasting money on this.
1,Poorly formatted DVD,"just so you know, it's impossible to click on ""p.m. callanetics"" without fast-forwarding through the a.m.i know, it sounds impossible. how could they do such a thing? but it's true. and i tried. and it gets REALLY frustrating.thanks to previous commenters, i expected that would happen. i would highly discourage purchasing this item UNLESS a new version is released with a better-formatted DVD."
5,This CD gets me going on my drive to work,"What a bunch of animals! This cd will get you going - I've had my copy for almost eight years and I still listen to it often. Very, very intelligent and talented musicians set this apart from the high school bands that don't cut it these days."
3,better in picture,"Good for what it is but due to issues would not buy it or from manufacturer again. My first review and I can't give it a good rating. The metal was scrapped as it was loose (not packed or wrapped) and rolling around in box. I believe it was returned and new bolts put in, the metal itself has rust dust all over it and had to be wiped off, which indicates rusting of the metal itself later on to come. Directions left out some particulars and made it confusing to assemble. Picture was some what misleading. Shelving is not that strong-heavy weighted plants will eventually cause wire shelving to pull away from frame and there goes the plants & your stand probably. Should be anchored, not sturdy, if any larger plants on top since that is the tallest area, one might put larger plants there."
5,Wonderful Green House A Must Have,I've had this greenhouse for over a year and I must say i is an excellent buy. Not only is it easy to move but its also easy to augment (one can remove or add rows) leading to variability in the type of plants grown and the stage of plant development desired. As I said before I've had this greenhouse for over a year and even during the dead of winter (when interior temperatures in my apt were 55-60 F) it kept my warm weather plants plants healthy and vibrant. I recommend it tripple fold to any serious gadener. Good quality low price.
4,Absolute Monotony. Been done too many times!!!!,I just had to write this to contradict a previous longwinded review. (Most likely written by the manufactured themselves. They DO write reviews for their own games!) This game absolutely stinks!!!! There is nothing origional about it. It's the same monotony over and over again. Don't waste the money. Use it to buy an old Simon game at a garage sale instead. (...) dont waste your money buying this piece of boring garbage. Lame from the very beginning-- even to a toddler.
4,A fun album...,"...especially if you like anachronistic covers. Okay, they're not covers per se, they're rerecordings by the original artists, acoustic-style. Still, mellow hair metal has its charm, mainly as a guilty pleasure."
3,Another fun adventure.,"Rene Goscinny, Asterix and the Goths (Dargaud, 1963)One of the earlier Asterix adventures that I somehow never managed to get round to till now. The Goths are invading Gaul. Well, a few of them, anyway. They want to kidnap Gaul's best druid to help them invade and conquer Gaul. Needless to say, you know who Gaul's best Druid is. Asterix and Obelix to the rescue! Goscinny takes a rather comedy-of-errors approach to this one, and it comes off quite nicely. Another of the better books in the series. ***"
4,Next Best Thing,"I played with GI Joes as a kid, so when I found Action Man in Hamley's, a London toy store, I had to buy one for my then 5 year old son. It's not the same one as here - the one I bought has alpine gear with skis, snowshoes, parka, and a rucksack. At first he liked it then it hit the toy bin for a year, but now he's been resurrected and I'd like to find more. The one I bought appeared to be part of an anniversary collection and limited production run. I've been back once or twice since and they were still being sold but never here in the states. I would definitely buy another and the options in the UK are fantastic, so I hope this reseller will carry more. Build quality isn't as good as the old GI Joes of the same size, but still decent enough."
5,KMFDM's best so far,"KMFDM has managed to release a large number of albums, with each having its own distinct style. Edging out ANGST by only a little, NIHIL is by far their best. Terror is probably the best song they've ever made. Worth getting without a doubt"
3,Overdone,"In my opinion this album's just too noisy. A few of the simpler songs are cool, for example ""Trust"", ""Beast"", and ""Revolution"", but then the others are just plain bad. Overall it's certainly not their best album- for that try Money, Adios, or Naive/Hell To Go."
5,Springy Mistletoe,Work in retail and hate to admit that wearing this headband was a big highlight of my Christmas season. Kinda Cindy Lou Hoo-ish but cute and customers (those that understood the whole Mistletoe/Kiss concept) got a chuckle out of my wearing it too.
5,collect this,"it's early miles on prestige remastered. round midnight and in your own sweet way, young dewey before he was cooking, working and sweating. a nice addition to your collection for sunday morning jazz brunch or just sitting home. for those who know jazz do the names trane, monk, and philly joe mean anything, paul chambers? kook clarke?"
1,Why bother?,"Why bother even listing a book that ships in ""4-6 weeks"" --grow up! it isn't 1950 anymore!"
4,Not the best but well above average,"When I upgraded from an Athlon 1800 to a 3200 64,new mb, SATA drive, DVD burner, I wanted to step up the gpu, from the old TNT 32Mbit card. On the recomendation of the clerk at Fry's I bought a BFG 5700le (254Mb)-- a bad choice--memory doesn't overcome a limited design. But I liked the no questions warranty and the easy oc features. I checked a lot of reviews on line and decided that for $100 more,the 6600GT was the right price/performance point. Its oc right out of the box, but can be bumped some more. Handles DoomIII at an average 60-63fps. Now I am not hard core, but this seems like a decent card, well layed out w/a quiet fan when compared to some others."
3,Geared to US,"Probably a nice book to use if you live in America but some of the ingredients are often impossible to come by in Australia (Yukon Gold Potatoes, for example). I miss the photos but I can live with that. Generally I think the recipes are a bit 70's and pretty uninspiring but the sausage section looks good. The 5 things I have made all worked well and instructions are easy to follow, but the final result has really been a bit bland. I'll keep working through the book, I might hit gold eventually( but not yukon potatoes)."
2,Not happy with this book at all,This book has really crappy recipes and only like 5 pictures in it. Half of the stuff i didn't even know what it was so i had to Google it.
4,Fun!,This book is a lot of fun! It's short but entertaining and the spider one really creeped me out!
4,María La Del Barrio (US Edition),This single from Thalía (U.S. version) was released in 1996. It contains the following tracks:1. Maria La Del Barrio;2. Piel Morena (Remix);3. Piel Morena (Karaoke);4. Entrevista con ThalíaScarce and indicated especially for collectors and fans.
2,A disappointing CD from a talented jazz singer,"It's not Lorez Alexandria's fault. Her voice is the same strong yet supple instrument familiar to her fans from other recordings. But on this CD, her distinctive style is submerged beneath the weight of overly busy arrangements, blaring horns, and a less than stellar choice of material.The one exception--and even here, Alexandria has to work overtime to be heard through the band's pyrotechnics--is the first cut, the quirky and challenging ""You're My Thrill,"" which a singer of Alexandria's caliber should have been able to make into a classic. It's interesting but, sadly, no more than that.As with the vastly superior ""Lorez Sings Pres,"" another King label reissue from the 1950s, this CD comes with no liner notes and no identification of the personnel (though in this case, that's probably a wise omission).I'm sorry to have to report that this CD is for diehard fans only."
5,Great Toy!,I got this for my 5 year old for Christmas and it's definitely one of his favorite gifts. He's very interested in music and this was the perfect solution to try a trumpet without buying a real metal one. He plays with it everyday.
4,Easier to play than the Sax,"My 5-year old son got this one and the saxxophone for Christmas and he is happy with them. For the price, they are decent quality and easy for him to use. The trumpet is a little easier to play than the sax but he likes them both."
4,It'll restore your faith in live jams!,"For a long time this great set wasn't available on compact disc, and now that it is, they've gone and added stuff unavailable on the older versions (I actually owned the two-record set). There's just something about an 18-minute version of Mandrake Root that really can't be beat. Gillan's voice isn't always in the best shape here (check out Child in Time), but even his bad days are good rock and roll. Lord's keyboard washes and Blackmore's noodlings sound better than ever (this is a better album than Made In Japan -- even the remastered version). If you like Deep Purple, there's no excuse for not owning this; if you are just curious, it's a great place to start; if you don't like artful heavy metal, why are you reading these reviews? Just buy the album."
5,I love it,I love this tape because it is very authentic the instructor takes thing slow so you can understand the exercises. I also bought 2 more to give as gifts.
4,Raggedy Ann is quite a doll,"I ordered this Raggedy Ann doll for my grand daughter's first birthday. It is quite large at 30"" for a one year old, and she was mesmerized by it. I use to hand make small Raggedy Ann dolls and so I was really surprised to find how well made this doll is. My only disappointment is it does not come in it's own box for wrapping only in the brown shipping box. But it is a good choice for a little one and the price is reasonable."
3,Its cute but too deep,"Its a cute product easy to wash but my cat doesn't like it too hard to get wet food out of it, he always goes to the other cats bowls to eat,they are much shallower, will probably use for dry food or as a water bowl."
3,"Shakira Blew Us Away (Whenever, Wherever)","We happened to catch Shakira's 'Whenever, Wherever' music video for the first time on Much Music this afternoon, and were very pleasantly surprised by her exiting voice and Latin influances (not to mention the lively visuals on the video).I can only offer the above rating as a rough '3' stars, since we only heard that one song from her latest album. I doubt her ratings will go anywhere but up as her music becomes more popular in Canada. Way to go Shakira! Her latest album is a definite 'buy' for our family."
4,Good Variety,I think that she is very talented.. and has the ability to make all types of diffrent sounding music.. you go girl!
4,WINNER!!!,"This Latin lady is definitely going to take the world by storm...or at least, the musically refined world by storm :)This is a brilliant album. Full stop. My favourite tracks are 'Fool' (sentimental, but rocky), 'Objection' (One word: tango), 'Whenever, Wherever' (One word: flutes), and 'Ojos Asi' (the Middle Eastern style is fantastic). I haven't heard any of her earlier albums, so I don't really know if she lost anything in the crossover. But that makes me impartial, and this impartial reviewer says this album is HOT."
2,Q Poca ! 8 canciones en INGLES!,"Sooooo disappointed.I'M A HUUUUUUUUUUUGE SHAKIRA FAN, have been for the past six years. I don't want to say this BRUNETTE sold out: her hair looks as good now as it did when it was red, but her songs just aren't poetic when they're translated word by word. And her voice sounds much better in spanish because she's not struggling with the pronunciation in the same way.Fool is OK. The words are understandable. It's not that easy to sing in another language, so kudos. The one's in spanish are GREAT! reminds me of what we're missing out on.I'd recommend buying her Unplugged album, Piez Descalzos, or Donde estan los Ladrones (and maybe a dictionary)...Shakira, te deseo lo mejor. Me encanta tu musica, y tus canciones, he comprado todos tus CD (este tambien) pero no dejes de cantar en espa~ol. Q no se te olvide quienes son tus fans."
3,"Good album, but don't forget about the others","Laundry Service shows Shakira's incredible songwriting talent, and I was amazed at how quickly she has mastered English to the point of writing her own lyrics in English. In my opinion, the best songs on the album are ""Whenever, Wherever"" and its Spanish equal ""Suerte"" along with ""Eyes Like Yours"" and ""The One"". I think the unique qualities of her voice and her singing are most evident on these songs. But I wouldn't say this is Shakira's best album, which is made even more clear when you listen to previous successes like Dónde están los ladrones. However, Shakira has made a bold move into the English-language market and I think that Laundry Service is a great first step which shows off her personality, style, and her extraordinary skill."
1,Sorry but I guess the Laundry was closed when she went,"WHAT IN THE WORLD IS HER PROBLEM ,I need a volunteer to go and to tell SHAKI that her voice is so bad and that because she is skinny doen't makes her a SINGER. PLEASE Shaki Open your eyes , you are making a fool of yourself , and that last video OBJECTION was S T U P I D.Honey someone is lying to you , you have a talent , of writing songs but Siging MMM... I DON'T THINK SO , so please make us a favor , make yourself a favor and stop singing , we want to keep the forest alive you know.And for you outhere DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT, UNLESS YOU LIKE TO SPEND YOUR MONEY IN GARGABE."
5,Taking the world by storm!!!!,Shakira is wonderful!!!!. She's trandsending Latin music to a whole new level. She's one of the greatest Latin pop/rock stars out there. I am so happy of her crossing over. We get to see this beautiful Latin artist do her thing. She's reminds me of Selena when she was getting ready to record her English album. I hope Shakira suceeds in EVERYTHING she does!!!!!!.
4,Refreshing,"I did not like this album after the first time I listened. However, the second and the third time - well, it kind of grows on you!Songs are not monotone or same as everything else out there.I believe this is a good buy and would recommend it.Also recommend ""ESCAPE"" if you're buying this album."
5,the entire album is great but one song stands out,"""Underneath Your Clothes"" is one of the most beautiful love songs I've ever heard. There are no songs on this album which can't stand on their own. Never mind about any language barriors. This one is a winner! Very highly recommended. If you have a passion for beautiful music with a Latin flair also check out Raul Malo (formerly of the Maverics) ""Today"". It's not his best work but again, there are some love songs on it which just can't be topped."
2,Livin' la vida loca revisited.,"This is the long awaited English CD from Shakira. Finalmente! The CD is a big let down; is more Ricky Martin and his kind than Shakira. Though, the CD boast that it was produced entirely by her, the sound and lyrics belies that.But, her voice does shines through and only that is worthwhile; and that is a big thing nonetheless.The English version of ""Ojos así"" is pathetic, is silly and it is quite obvious that the voice and the music don't go together.Es una gran pena, la musica es como la de Ricky Martin no suena como la auténtica Shakira."
3,So cliche,Shakira's past CDs have been an amazing mix of latin - oriental-mid eastern beats. This cd just goes to show you that when you mix pop with anything you lose your identity.Whenever and Wherever is the only song on this cd that takes you back to the old shakira sound.
2,Lost in the translation.,This release is a disappointment compared to the spanish language albums. The production tried too hard to sound like a lot of the fabricated teen artists of today. And even though Shakira wrote a lot of the material it is easy to hear that someone held her hand on LAUNDRY SERVICE. It just sounds bland and could be mixed in with a lot of homogenized pop artists.But this is her first English album. Maybe if the sales are high for this one she'll be able to put in her own signiture for the next one. But when you're on TRL you have to mesh in with that sound some how. Let's hope that Shakira doesn't get lost in the soon-to-be teen pop rejects or too late in being a part of the latin craze.
2,what?,I can barely understand the english??? She definately has the talent to be a star here in the US but she has to do her own work. Obviously on this album she had to mimic the way too old teen style instead of her own style. Her music is much better in spanish
4,strange confluence,"The first time i heard ""underneath your clothes"" was on the music video without looking at the screen. didn't know jack about the ""latin pop dancing diva."" 'captivated by the sound but could have sworn it was a ""new country"" song, ala Shania Twain, with all the formulaic voice trills and drops, even the words gave me a faith hill-like hit. and then i look at the screen and realize who it is, doin' the slut look far beyond mariah. good set of songs, great voice, eerie mix of country ideoms, celinesque middle notes, alanis/mariah jumps and pops. I just can't reconcile the song/words/sound/video/repuation of her cross-over cd. can't wait to see who she turns into on her next cd."
1,She is such a bad singer,"Horrible Voice, Stupid Lyrics, compare to Alanis Morisette and Dolores from the cranberries, she must be the worst clone ever made from recycle pop artists factory imported directly from colombia.The only reason why she is singing is because of Emilio EstefanDid you know that shakira wish to sing a duo with Bono from U2I think I'm gonna have nigthmares just like when Sting and Puf Daddy sang together in the MTV Music awardsDo Not use this Laundry Service, please wash your clothes by yourself"
3,Great songs ; bad English,"Nowadays when you hear Shakira, you can tell that her English has improved greatly since she first hit it big in the U.S.But that doesn't help when it comes to this album. The songs have great Latin beats, but her broken English really destroys the beauty of the songs.I think Shakira should have waited until she knew English better before she tried recording songs in our language. It's just like U.S. singers who don't know a word of Spanish but run to release a Spanish album. To them, they might not sound that bad, but every Spanish listener will surely cringe at their horrible lyrics.Shakira does have a great voice so if you can get over the fact that many of her songs make no sense and are filled with broken English, you might enjoy this album."
3,E for effort,"OK, so my baby didn't do so well on her first attempt at a crossover album...worse things have happened. She really gave it a good try, but it just isn't the same.What next Shakira?(I still give her 5 stars for her looks)"
2,Hate it,"If you have read anything else I have reviewed, I have tried to be fair (I don't know many people who have actually given a good rating to a Metallica album on the grounds of its artistic merit, event though he hates it) but I think I hate Shakira.Her songs aren't terrible, in fact it could be good. However, I can't stand her voice! It is awful. Credit where credit is due; this is her first English speaking album and perhaps in the future she will produce a far better effort."
4,A good start,"This CD is certainly worth buying, but for old-time Shakira fans, don't expect the same quality of lyrics as those in""Donde estan los ladrones?"". For me, the only track that really dissapointed was ""Eyes like yours"" (""Ojos asi""). I doesn't flow so well as the Spanish version.The best songs for me are: Fool, Poem to a horse and Underneath your clothes."
2,"Matoladado, que pena...","I had the pleasure of seeing Shakira record her MTV Unplugged CD about two years ago. I then had the agony of watching her perform in English on SNL. She has been, Tony Matoled & Emilio Estefaned right out of her charm and genuine appeal. They even tried to make her look like Mariah Carrie!! For me, Laundry List belongs in the bargin bin. Que lastima!FF"
1,Warning: incompatible new Sony format,"Want to listen to this CD on your computer, car CD player, or MP3 player? Then think carefully before purchasing this disc, since this disc was purposely manufactured to NOT WORK in those players."
2,IT ALMOST SUCKS,"I was a huge Shakira's fun, i liked her first cd ""Pies descalzos"" even though it was more simple, and ""Dónde están los ladrones?"" was cool too, the mtv umplugged had really weird singles like ""Donde estas corazon?"" it just freaked me out.But this album is just so annoying for me!, i hope the best to Shakira, but now she is so different!, she belongs to an industry, and every single is so commercial, and her image, now she is blond, more american maybe..."
3,you better start taking spanish classes,read the title anyway nothing too exciting here just another pop diva in the britney-christina tradition trying to cash in.
2,A little disappointed...,"I have to be honest, I was a little disappointed with this album. Shakira is just bombshell. I mean, she's so pretty and it's so brave of her to learn English and make an English album and everything. I just don't really like her style of singing. This is just my personal opinion, but the voice-cracking thing she does gets just a tad annoying. However, you know, maybe that's the common style of singing in her country. I definitely respect that. So, would I recommend Laundry Service? No. However, if you have an extensive CD collection and would like to add some exotic flavor, go for it."
1,No wonder she had only sold 63 copies! Her family bought it,"Just to support her not to because they like it, I mean can somebody please tell me what languague was used to record this cd.'cause it does not sounds like English to me. It is more like a crying goat.Anyways, people if you like good music, with good lyrics and a good voice , DON'T BUY THIS CD, is really bad and YOU CAN't UNDERSTAND A WORD SHE SAYS or SINGS.And for Shaki All I have to say is no le pases por alto a tus problemas COMPRA INGLES SIN BARRERAS , NO OFENSE!"
1,insane price,$20 for 12 taco shells? you can buy 20 tacos at taco bell for that price (including tax in most locales)
3,a good book,"I enjoyed reading this book and was delighted to find out its a sequel. I'll go back and read the first book just as soon as I can order it.This is a time travel book that has the hero traveling back in time to the time of Charlemagne. The hero is a modern day man who is trying to stop a scientist from sending people back in time. Mike accidentaly falls into the machine and ends up inn the 8th century and has no idea who he is or where he is. He is found by the beautiful young, by modern standards, Danise. She nurses him back to health and they fall for each other. But even though they have fallen in love they have serveral obsticals to overcome before they can be together. Enemies in both time periods try and rip them from each other.This book has very tender love scenes and an interesting plot. I enjoyed this book quite a bit and I would highly recommend it."
4,khaa review don't kil me,"Damn good book, this book is realy in debt with these 5 latino's. However there a alot of important latino's in america. It will be wonderful if the author wrote about equally important but less known Hispanic Americans."
5,Lost world,"They have destroied everything , have redused to black square and have gone out... You can like Kandinsky or not.His mysteries reflect Russia , epoch of silver century .You can feel the puls of time. Deep penetrating in one's heart of hearts,skill to see in fine its livng connect with epoch,with people,that all fascinate a notprejudice reader of this book."
4,How to train your dragon: Gift of the Night Fury,"A book that any age can read with an enjoyable story, you would need to have read the first book of the serries to get what this book is about"
1,DO NOT BUY ALONE. RIP OFF,ok i was soo excited to see this at walmart thinkin it was a full length dvd. and yes it pick up right where the other left off. so i got it and watched it and hey guess what....?? 22 mins after it was over.!!! not even 50 min long and sooo wasn't worth the 10 bucks i wasted on it.
3,You Gotta Be Mediocre.,"I have all four Des'ree cds and the one thing that's common across them all is mediocrity. Every single time Des'ree has to ruin her albums with drudgery. Each disc, including ""Dream Warrior"" has half an album's worth of great music. On this disc it would be ""It's Okay (Stargate Radio Edit)"", ""Why"" ""Righteous Night"", ""Doesn't Matter"" and ""Human"". The rest is just plain boring. The overall feeling I was left with after listening to ""Dream Warrior"" was that ""I Ain't Movin'"" (1994) still remains her best cd to date."
4,Replacing a previous game,This was a replacement for the same game. I wore the other one out and wanted a replacement because I enjoy playing it when I am waiting. It's a good way to fill in time slots because i can put it down in an instant and come back to it later.
1,too bad it broke in 2 weeks - don't buy this,"This broke within two weeks. The person (an adult) to whom I gave it, loved it! But that's not a lot of good if it breaks."
1,Buy A Laptop,"I imagine this gadget may be adequate for the UltraHardcore Freecell Junkies among us. However, even as big a Freecell Zombie as I am I think this hand held ""version"" is a useless POS. I find it impossible to differentiate the four suits in any useful way. Yeah, you can see them by squinting but, since there's no color involved to distinguish hearts and diamonds from clubs and spades, it's almost impossible to figure out which card should go where. In addition, and, I think, a problem with all these solitare games, is the fact that you cannot see the entire field of cards so you have no idea where the aces are, e.g., without constantly using the ""up"" and ""down"" buttons.In short, this game is pretty much for those who are desperate to play Freecell in the WORST way, because this is truly the worst way I can imagine. If you are totally jonesing for a hit of Freecell and you're dependant on your desktop, then get yourself a small laptop. Don't waste your money, as I did, on this toy."
4,Great Chairs Though Smaller Than Originally Thought,I love my new chairs but was surprised they were smaller than I imagined they would be. Not that this was Amazon's fault. Probably should of read the specifics more carefully. In any case I still would of bought them. I am very glad to have chairs now that do not have the back and back legs connected into one piece. The price was good considering they came already made. No more fearing to let anyone (or ourselves) seat on our chairs!
4,Sturdy and good looking chairs,"UPDATE: These chairs were $69 when I initially purchased them. Since then, the price has gone up significantly. My *inexpensive* comment may not apply, but the rest of the review stands.These are inexpensive, very sturdy and good looking chairs. I selected 4 of these chairs to match a table that I have. After searching locally, I was unable to find a set of chairs to match the table. My goto website, Amazon.com., has yet to fail me in hard-to-find items, and with a few keywords, I found the exact chairs that matched my table. Free Shipping with Amazon Prime is great.These chairs are well built, and I am not a small person. The paint and finish appear very durable for mass production chairs.One of the chairs I ordered was damaged by the shipper. Returning the chair to Amazon was a cinch; I set up the return online, and I had my replacement BEFORE I had shipped the damaged chair back to Amazon (and at no cost to me other than a little packing tape). How awesome is that?"
3,Little Black Chairs,"Chairs sufficed for the purpose intended. They are made of sturdy wood, but they are not perfect in their finishes. I had to return two of the four for really rough patches. Even with the return the four I purchased are okay, but not of high quality."
4,Exactly what we wanted!,"We bought our kirchen set 15 years ago. The table is still in great shape but over the years the chairs have just worn out. We've been replacing them one or two at a time at a place here in Houston called ""Garden Ridge Pottery."" The problem is we buy 1 or 2 chairs and they last a couple months and then we're back buying the same chairs again. The chairs that we just purchased through you seem to be reinforced better.It's only been a few weeks since we've had them, but they do seem to be built stronger."
2,Too drawn out.,I think parts of this book were too drawn out and actually got quite boring. It hasn't even been a month since I read it and I can't even remember what it was about.
5,GREAT SOUND,A small unit that delivers great sound. A great price also. Best Buy had it for $150.00 Thank You Amazon!
4,"Good value, nice design","I don't own these yet but I compared them in the Apple Store and the only thing I felt was significantly better was Apple's own iPod HiFi which of course in its brick-like format is luggable but not really portable. These make for a better overall compromise on sound than Bose's $300 product (which is too bass-biased for my taste), and they decisively beat anything else in the $100 to $200 price range and certainly anything else that actually qualifies as genuinely portable.The design is also very good -- other posters have noted how convenient the shape is, but I'd like to add the way it supports the iPod from the back so that pressing on the iPod controls doesn't excessively strain the plug. You either use it in its raw state for the 60GB iPod or insert the included liner for the 30GB or nano."
5,Logitech970173-0403mm50 portable speakers/iPod,"This was the best thing we could have given our daughter for christmas. She takes it everywhere she goes. It travels well,and the sound it puts out is trully awesome. I couldn't believe it when she started plying it. And with the earplugs she can listen to her music in the car and we can hear ours. It charges her iPod much easier than the last iPod charging base and the cost was much less. I would recommend this product to anyone over all the other charger/portable speakers that I've had in the past. Plus, we were told it would'nt arrive until close to the 24th of December. We received it a week sooner. I definitely would buy logitech in the future. Karla Andrie"
4,Logitech portable speakers,great small speakers. Love that it comes with a carrying case and battery back up. Use it regularly at home but have also brought it with me when traveling.
5,amazing,"i love the logitech mm5 portable speakers. my older sister has a video ipod and i have a nano. we share a room and have the speakers sitting on our dresser. i listen to it all the time.at first my parents weren't to sure about the whole ipod idea, but now the totally think it is a great idea.they even listen to it."
3,Just Okay,"Several people have said in reviews that these speakers don't get that loud, but I didn't expect that it would be a problem for me because I typically don't listen to music that loud anyway. However after purchasing these I would have to stress to any potential buyers that these speakers REALLY don't get very loud at all. In fact their lack of volume has been a real disappointment in certain cases. For example: I like to listen to some news podcasts while I'm in the shower, the volume is so low I can't hear the thing well enough to understand the dialog even though the mm50 is only 5 feet away from me. The lack of sound coming from the speakers makes you think you're doing something wrong and there must be a way to make them louder...there's not.Also the battery does NOT last as long as they say, I only get three or so hours out of a full charge.On the plus side it does have nice well balanced sound."
1,After few years of using it...its useless.,"I've been using it for several years until the rechargeable battery died, so I can't use it anymore without plugging in at the AC socket. I sent an email to Logitech support but they told me that they cannot replace the battery nor repair the unit because they no longer supported it and its already out of warranty. So I vowed that I will never buy another logitech product again."
4,Great,"This speaker system is great for traveling, has exceptional sound quality, and was recommended to us by a friend who does alot of research on everything before buying. I loved the case that makes it so easy to pack it no matter where you're heading. Once the rechargeable battery is dead, it cannot be replaced and is not as portable - only disadvantage. Liked the fact that it recharges the iphone while you're playing it. Makes a great gift too."
3,Running out of Batteries!!!,"I love these speakers-- for the price, the sound is great, and the battery life is decent. The problem occurs when you put these in their case, and try to take them somewhere. The ""on"" button is extremely sensitive, and I'll often open up the travel case to find that it's been on for who knows how long. As a result, I never know whether it is fully charged, or has any juice at all. I have ended up carrying the cord everywhere (it doesn't fit in the case) because several times I have planned on using it, only to find that I can't even turn it on!"
5,Get Serious Pet Stain Remover,"The problem with some other stain removers (Nature's Miracle) is that some yellowing can occur but for product to be effective, carpeting must fully dry. This is not always practical. I could not wait a few days much less a week for treated area to not be an ""attractor"" for future accidents. With Get Serious, apply, brush, & blot, thats all. I find that after blotting, I rinse the area will warm water & shop vac to speed up the drying time."
4,Simple basic watch!,"For the money, this watch is worth it. Stainless steel case, mineral glass, nylon strap, quartz movement. Nothing more. The face is easy to read. (no backlight or glow in the dark features.) Below each number is the military equivilant for anyone working on the 24hour clock. No day date features, which are the common points of failure on cheaper watches, just less to go wrong on this model.I took one star off for the VERY cheap nylon stap. It was uncomfortable, and the notches stop for wrists larger than mine. I replaced them with some old leather Timex straps that literally took 30sec to do.I selected this watch for something very basic for business travel. My work has me constantly flying from one time zone to the other. I needed something that didn't have a day/date feature to constantly move back and forth while traveling. And I will not have to worry about wear and tear for a 15 dollar watch. I gladly would re-buy this over a Timex if I had to do it all over again."
2,Face inside watch not secure,The size is smaller than i was hoping for but kept excellent time.The piece that has the hours printed on it have shifted and then 11 is where the 12 should be.Good water Resistance.
2,Not the quality I expected,"--Proscheapdecent mechanismlightweighteasy to read face--Cons.strap is CRAP. Very cheap nylon. Just get a different one.the ""dial"" on the side to adjust the time is so hard to pull out. feels very fragile..The face is really small. I dont need a huge face, but this is for teens/womenI dont recomend this. pay more for a better watch."
4,A read for tikling those with humorous wits,"Though the book deals with Science Fiction, its purpose is entertainment. Entartain it does. Dickson mixes up the wits of a married couple that serve as Earth's representatives with the rest of the galaxy. He creates a new genrea called Humor Sci-fi. It's surely a pleasant read for any sci-fi fan."
3,good for a beginner,"I've been a Solaris admin for a while and am recently moving towards linux. The book looked fairly complete on a quick view at the book store. After owning it for a few months I find I can't find the answer to my more advanced questions in this book. So I'd say it is a good book for beginners, but not for someone that is looking for an advanced linux reference."
4,"Good Debut, Great Cover Design, Not Remastered.","This is a very expensive version of a disc that you can get remastered for a better sound at a much cheaper price unless you really must have the mini-lp sleeve packaging. Admittedly, the album cover is a great work of art though but if you already have the unremastered version of this disc, you are better off getting the cheaper remastered version that's out there. Overall though, this is a good debut for the quirky but very talented female version of Bob Dylan; a modern-day poet disguised as a pop singer. Recommended."
2,Fact or Fiction? You Decide,"Just read this book and if we are to believe everything in it we have to believe:1- FDR was in bed with the Chicago Mob2- Ditto for Harry Truman3- Ditto for Nixon as Vice President4- President Kennedy was killed by the Chicago Mob AND the CIA with the FBI knowing but not doing anything about it.5- Lee Harvey Oswald was a trained CIA agent6- Jack Ruby who killed Lee Harvey Oswald was a the Chicago Mobs man in Dallas7- Chuck Giancana was in no way a member of the Chicago Mob and never committed any crimes for them.8- Sam Giancanna murders another Kennedy. This time Robert Kennedy.If you dissect this book and pick out what you can see is actual fact there isn't much to the book. What is left is mob murders, betrayals, corruption and the like. Not much to the book otherwise. Save your money see if you can get a copy from the library."
4,Very Informative (If True),"Conversational and easy reading first-person narrative. Very informative if true (and rings true). Vividly sadistic descriptions are ""off-putting."""
4,Is there Anything about Sam's Wedding....,"OK So I know this really isn't the best way to go asking questions, but it seems that It's a good start.Is there anything in the book about the marriage of Sam Giancana and Angeline, primarily any photos taken during the wedding? (Moderne Studios). Reason being.. I belive that I might have Angeline's wedding dress..."
4,"Soup to nuts on Sam ""Mooney"" Giancana","I must admit, being from New York City, I'm not too savvy on the mobsters from Chicago. (Al Capone and Johnny Torrio were both from Brooklyn).However, this book gave me as much background as possible about the inner working of the Chicago mob, going back to the Roaring Twenties. Giancana was not a nice guy, and that is graphically shown by the authors: his brother Chuck and his nephew Sam. Chuck alternately loves then hates his brother, and in fact doesn't see him for many years from the point of their unamicable breakup until Mooney Giancana's wake.According to this book, Mooney Giancana truly thought he was bulletproof until someone close to him put a few bullets in his head.Nice read and highly recommended."
1,Dysfunctional phone,"Well I had hoped to replace my separate caller id and voice mail flashing light boxes with the built-in functions of this phone, but... the caller id function does not work. It will not scroll through all the calls received, and I found the new call light failed to flash when I had voice mail to receive, and it was impossible to turn off the new call light, I thought the phone was a defect and Amazon exchanged it, but the new one failed the same way. AT+T/Lucent 800 number in the manual was of no help either..."
4,sticking keys,"I have only one problem with this phone. The dialing buttons with numbers tend to stick and I have to hit them really hard and sometimes have to redial because a key may not connect.Otherwise I have no sound, scrolling or caller Id problems."
5,Very nice,I actually bought this for 29.99 - it's cheaper now. Looks fantastic on display on my desk. The other logos are good too.
3,More of the same,"I've debated with myself about writing this review for a while. I'm a big fan of Eddi - I own all her solo albums and I've seen her in concert 3 times. I even wrote a laudatory review for Angels & Electricity.But I find this album to be disappointing. There is nothing new and I don't feel she is progressing much as an artist. I thought the writing combination of her and Boo Hewerdine was extremely gifted. Now I think maybe she needs to broaden her horizons and seek out new writing partners and material. Otherwise this will be my last Eddi Reader cd.If you are new to Eddi I would suggest one of her stronger cd's - any of the first three will do. My personal favourite is the second one - Eddi Reader.Her voice is magical, her sensitivity and emotion remains. But the songs just aren't very memorable.What do you think?"
2,Not what I expected.,"The Bobbie pins I received are not the ones that are pictured, so I was disappointed. The ones that came are better than what you can get in the store, but not what I was looking for."
5,Lynch hit it on this one,"I'll be honest, when I bought this CD I knew it would be sick. If you think you never heard Doc before and you listen to any Black Market/Siccmade then your wrong cause he's all over it with Lynch, rappin verses here and there. If you like rap from Sacramento you have to have this CD, this one is in the record books with season, no doubt gotta cop it."
3,It's kinda flat...,"I owned this one ages ago when I first started to get into electronic/gothic/industrial music... I bought this, Symbols, Kraftwerk's ""Computer World,"" and The Cure's ""Pornography"" all on the same day. Half the songs are the same as the original, which I now have... but I could always tell that this one wasn't quite as awesome. I loved ""Naive,"" ""Disgust,"" ""Achtung,"" and ""Friede (Remix)"" is my favorite KMFDM song EVER. I grew up on George Clinton, so that one was waaay up my alley! But the only remix that I really liked on this album was ""Virus-Pestilence."" Until I bought the Virus single. ""Piggybank"" owns, though."
4,Good Value,Good Value for under $10. Advantage over cordless phone is no need to find a plug for the darn A/C adapter. I have three throughout the house and the only drawback that I've experienced is that the info-packed LED display may be be difficult to read depending on the room's ambient light sorce during the course of the day.
1,I was fooled,"I purchased this phone for the Caller ID feature, it seemed a good buy for the price and compact. But after only one week, I pick up the phone to dial and the buttons go wacko, blinking, and hanging up any calls I may be lucky to get through! I was very disappointed b/c of the usually reliable brand name. I will definitely NOT keep this one or recommend it!"
4,Mortal's finest hour,"I'm the furthest thing from a Christian, but I don't care if you write music about Jesus or Satan or agnosticism - just make me feel something. This is a great industrial rock album with inventive loops, samples, and nice melodies. There's some great energy, and the lyrics aren't half bad either. They never again made anything like it. This is their peak."
2,Runs VERY small! Order ONLY from Amazon.com,"This shoe was impossibly small, about a full size, which was an expensive shock to me. I had heard that MBT sometimes ran small but since I do not wear socks with sandals, I thought purchasing to the upper end of my normal size would be about right. I wanted these sandals for a vacation trip and was very disappointed to send them back. Also, as I had purchased them from an ""Amazon partner"" not Amazon.com, it was an expensive mistake. It cost me $13 to return the item to the storefront seller, ""Heart & Sole."" Beware of dealing with storefront sellers when purchasing a ""fit item."" The delivery was ridiculously SLOW, and then the return was costly. Only Amazon.com and Amazon Prime delivery for me."
2,Poor Technical Support,"The machine worked great for the money (we'll see how the durability of the wheel and machine holds up). However, I was very dissatisfied w/ the tech support. I wanted to run it on DC power w/ a generator or inverter. When I went the inverter route I went up to inverters w/ surge up to 2400W. It blew the inverter. Then I tried a neighbors 600CW generator w/ 3000 surge. It blew that as well. Their support offered no help other than it shouldn't have done that. They quote no surge or return phone calls. I would move on past ATEC for all athletic training needs."
4,Great literature and painful lesson,"While this tragedy is set almost 100 years ago the lessons ring even more true today - follow your passion, have a strong moral compass around your vocation and listen to a smart woman. The Harder they Fall is an incredibly well written, perfectly paced piece of fiction. I highly recommend it, especially if you like Hemingway or Fitzgerald."
3,Red Krayola - 'Indroduction' (Drag City),"Even though this Red Krayola CD is considered by some to be the band's 'most accessible' effort to date, I thought it was decent. Not great but good. On 'Introduction', founder Mayo Thompson had pulled in past Krayola members - Stephen Prina, Tom Watson and John McEntire (Sea & Cake, Tortoise). Tunes here I got the most out of were the hypnotic ""Psy Ops"", ""It Will Be (Delivered)"", the upbeat ""Greasy Street"" and ""When She Went Swimming"". This disc will eventually grow on you."
2,Confusion,"Although Goodman is generally attributed as on of the leaders of the Anti-Realist position, Ways of Worldmaking does not provide a good argument for that position. Goodman's talk is highly open to interpretation, but most interpretations lead to trivial truth or outlandishly bizarre scenarios. The lack of detailed argument makes refutation difficult, but still it is a must read for those interested in what Anti-Realism is."
5,Saknussemm won me over ...,"This is not the kind of book I would normally pick up. But I did pick it up, and once I was into it I could not put it down. This is a book for a thinker who loves humor, wit, and having his perceptions of the world challenged.The main character, Clearfather, was engaging and intriguing, and I enjoyed finding out more about him as he found out more about himself. The supporting cast were funny and odd and endearing and ... well, very enjoyable.The multitude of cultural and political references is amazing - and the genius of how Saknussemm did it was that I could not really tell whether I didn't `get' something because I was simply ignorant of it, or because he made it up. He weaves fantasy and reality together so skillfully that I was completely taken in, in a way - I felt as if I just had to keep reading to see if I could figure it out.I'll definitely be reading this again - it made me think in such an enjoyable way!"
5,very absorbant,"These pads really work better than the puppy wee wee pads. Thought because we have a small dog, the puppy pads were good enough. I got tired of using paper towels to pick up pee because it rolled right off the pad. Very absorbent and very happy with my purchase."
2,Just like paper,Each pad is so thin that it can barely take one sqeezing. Paper towels are more absorbant than this product.
5,Happy Puppy,"I have been ordering this product from this company for almost a year now and I have to say I am completely satisfied. The delivery is within days of the order being placed, the pads work very well, no leakage what so ever, and they are the cheapest. They are cheaper and better than Petsmart, Petco and Pet Supermarket. I have already recommended this product to friends."
1,Not absorbent,This item was stated to be much more absorbent than the puppy wee-wee pads. I have purchased the puppy pads and they are much more absorbent the the adult ones. Do not waste your money on this product. Get the extra large wee-wee pads for puppy training for your adult dog.
2,Interesting,This book was poorly written but I lived in the area back in the day and knew one of the people on the periphery of this story so I found it very interesting. The end gets much better if you can work your way through!
5,Great Monitor,"Love it. Would buy another if I needed one. It is the 2nd monitor of this brand that I have in my office. Never heard of them before, but find them to be of high quality."
4,Feels incredibly play-like but still intriguing,"An all-dialogue movie. Baseball. Theater. Downey Jr in make-up with a black-eye, meditating, carrying a gun. Keaton going about his day, also armed, speaking in snappy one-liners. Don DeLillo has written a very witty, slow-burning film with great performances and little action. The dialogue sounds very, very, very much like a play. It should have been a play. This doesn't detract from it, I guess, though it won't appeal to many people, especially those expecting a movie movie, if that makes sense. Yes-sir-re-bob."
3,"Still needs work, better than the first","This video does have a lot of good music, my favorite being Exodous, but suffocation and shadows fall are also descent bands. The interviews are slightly less disruptive than the first volume of this, but Jasmine does interupt the artist with sensless rebellion phrases, and her style of interview is still very superficial, and crude at some points. Not attractive. As for worst part, Black Dahlia Murders interview, they are all just stoned. Pointless to film. Either way, pick this up for cheap if you must, but do not go out of your way for."
3,Ummm...,"This is the third book I have read in this series. The first book was really good and I was looking forward to the book with Kil in it. But, I am very disappointed to say the least. I pictured Kil as a real alpha male and at first he is. The main female character Marty was unrealistic at first she is this strong woman and I expected some real tension between the two but that fell flat. This book could of been wonderful and parts of it is that is why I give it 3 stars."
3,Aliens....,"Yeah alien erotica. What can I say. If you want to read about hot alien sex ,then get this book."
5,Awsome thriller!! Emotional seesaw!! Cliff Hanger.,"Trust me on this i HATE books!! H-A-T-E books. book are my enemy. But some how this book became my favorite by coincidence im a gemini. This book go to worse to really worse. and freaky to really freaky. This is my favorite book of all times, i also love every other zodiac chiller. i also recomend my 2nd favorite book Pices Drowning. I read this book in 2 days thats a record for me! My last record before this was 1 month. Please read this book if youre into freaky book. If your into gory books like me try stephen King!"
1,If anything - it deserves negative stars,"I usually am excited for a Teo Leo album, but this...this is just unreal. Noise, backwards stuff, more noise, sound effects, tape loops, even more noise, and when there IS music, it sounds like it was played on cheap amateur instruments and recorded with a cassette recorder using those 99 cent tapes from the drug store with radio interference, talking and traffic noises in the background. Just really really awful. There is no excuse for this. Really."
4,Not as good as there 1st album,This album is allot different than there 1st album. this album is more trance like and allot calmer. I prefer the harder techno-industrial style of the 1st album. I do enjoy this album though and it's too bad this band is no longer around.
3,Needs a little help...and honesty!,"First of all, you are guaranteed a genuine emerald by Educational Insights...what did we get? A green BEAD. With a hole in it and everything. That's no emerald, folks...Also, the plastic knife is fairly useless against this tough material. I finally took out my dissecting kit and helped my son out, but then we finally decided to do what others have suggested, and soften the ""rock"" up with water - instead of spraying, we actually put it in a tub of water and let it soften a little at a time. This makes things fairly messy, but if you prepare with old clothes, a washcloth, and lots of newspaper it's not too much of a problem.So be prepared to work hard or compromise the approach...and don't necessarily expect a real emerald in there! That was the most disappointing thing for us, because it seems dishonest and my son was so excited to be looking for a genuine, valuable gemstone."
4,fun but a little expensive for what you get,"Our 7 year old daughter had a blast with this. It was something we worked on together. Very educational and probably something she will remember for the rest of her life. It takes patience but its fun. The only thing is, two of the stones or gems that are included in the 9 that you get are teeny tiny little beads. They should at least tell you that beforehand. I think its overpriced. But the experience was great."
3,I would actually give it 2 1/2 stars but I can't so I'll just give it 3 stars to be nice,"BacK when I was in 3rd and 4th grade, these books were my favorite books in the world. I was so sad in the first one that I actually cried and left tear marks on my book. However, since then, I have realized that these books are not actually that wonderful. They're sad, yes, but in a soap-opera kind of way. Personally, I like books that are sad but not so corny. In the sixth book (I think that's the one) when something happens between Ty and Amy, I was just like ""oh please"" because it was kind of annoying. Oh well, the books are OK."
1,Don't waste your money...,"What, like, a waste of time ! I'll admit it; I read Black Lace novels for the graphic sex; a story line I can get in a Nora Roberts book. This book had potential with the protaganist torn between her staid, vanilla sex fiance and hot, mind-blowing sex with a studly construction worker. But, I didn't expect the 'fade-to-black' sex romps. Boring, boring, boring. It was also hard to tell what was real and what she was making up. All in all a very disappointing read. I gave it 1 star for potential only."
5,Brand New,"The book was brand new, the shipping was very fast, It was very different story line from the anime. First book of a new collection"
1,"Don't buy for a Dodge RAM 1500, though it's listed as compatible.","This part is listed as compatible with a Dodge RAM 1500. ""This product fits your 2005 Dodge Ram 1500Engine: 5.7L V8 Gas OHV Distributorless Naturally Aspirated SFI Electronic FI MFI""By no stretch of the imagination is it a valid replacement. 1/6 of the size of the original part and the diameter of the pipes is about 1/2 that of the hoses it should connect to. Not a chance of fitting without major modification to existing hoses and connectors, which would cost you more than an original part and drop the performance of the cooling to a ridiculous level. Skip it."
1,Incredibly Slow,No Information on where it is.... i think they are in Alaska and are walking the product... I'll change it if i actually ever hear anything regarding where this is.. or we will cancel... Order it elsewhere
4,3030 Innova Code Reader - Works Great!,Bought this product to reset codes and diagnose issues with my personal vehicles. It works great and is a wonderful add to my tool kit. I think I will start to charg everyone at work who wants me to read their OBDII codes!
1,useless,Bought for 2002 Subaru Impreza. Did not communicate with car computer. Even though it includes a disc and USB cable this device has to be returned to the manufacturer to update the firmware. Waste of money.
2,"Reader ok, but software a bust!","Reads ok, but so would the cheaper readers sold here on Amazon. I was expecting a lot from the included software cd, but like another reviewer said, the software is a rip! Just a was to sell you something on their website. Not sure why you even connect the usb cable except to register the product. You go their website, register and enter in your VIN, so they can track you and probably send you spam galore. Their software may even send info without you knowing it, but who knows! The manual sucks. If connecting the usb cable does anything useful, they don't tell you. No where are the code explanations listed in it. You have to go online to their website to get the damn codes, or on the internet! I gave it two stars because of the needless waste of time that they put you through and the useless software."
3,"Decent product, horrible company!","I purchased this scanner at approximately $80 before the discount went into effect. At the time, I had a 2004 BMW 530i and a 2004 Dodge Viper SRT-10. The scanner read OBDII codes flawlessly for both cars, and was extremely easy to use. However, the ""erase"" function was completely broken -- it just said ""FAIL"" on the screen when trying to erase codes.I wrote the company for a resolution, but was unable to receive one. They wanted a receipt, which I understand, but refused to accept a duplicate receipt printed from the point of sale register. Now, I have a half-working scanner."
4,EQUUS 3030 INNOVA CODE READER,"The unit works fine, but it takes a lot of reading and thinking before you can understanding it and then it gets easier."
4,Easy to use with a lot of information,"Though without all the bells and whistles of other, more expensive code readers, this Equus 3030 Innova does the job perfectly. All codes appear with indication as to what systems might have issues. A nice feature is the indicator lights on the front that inform you if there can be an emissions issue for state inspections.I have only been using it for a month so far but it has saved me a lot of money by telling what the issues are with my cars that caused the check engine lights to come on so I could fix them myself."
5,Great Buy,I bought this tool because I have a 2002 dodge stratus that has some electrical problems and the check engine light is always coming on. Since it costs about 60 dollars at the dealer just to reset the check engine light this tool has already paid for itself since I have reset the light 5 times since I bought it. It is also very easy to use and the codes are detailed enough even for the weekend mechanic. This tool has also helped me identify 2 problems with my car that i was able to repair immedietly. This really was a good buy.
1,Won't Turn Off Check Engine Light on 2002 Subaru Forester,"Have tried two of these units, and neither one will turn off the check engine light on my 2002 Subaru Forester. I called Innova tech support, and while they were helpful and polite, they only could suggest trying the reader with the engine running (which I did, with no success). I have ordered an Actron brand unit now and returned both of the 3030's to Amazon.So if you're a Subaru owner, you might want to look elsewhere, or at least keep all your packaging to make sure you can make a return."
5,Good Product,"Great product. Removed ""Service Engine Soon"" light and gave me the code that caused light to go on in the first place."
3,Here's What I think,I think I haven't heard this set and I'm not familiar with a lot of the tracks on it. Not surprising seeing as I'm not Dutch. Still it sure would be nice if someone who has this CD can let us know how it sounds. Are the tracks from master tapes or from vinyl?I'm most interested in the track Window Shopping by R Dean Taylor. I found it funny that the set is called ONE Hit Wonders and there are TWO tracks by R Dean Taylor.
2,Too small for it's own good,"We thought that a small cordless phone would be a great idea. Boy were we wrong. It's like having to talk on your cell-phone at home. The phone is unomfortable to hold for long periods of time and it has that same tin-can like sound-quality that you get from the tiny speakers they put in cell phones. Also, for a products that cost $100 it looks and feels cheap."
1,Short usable life,"About a year after purchasing this phone, it started showing symptoms that the battery was going bad because the handset would stop functioning after 30 minutes of use despite letting it sit in the base for hours. Replaced it with a new battery, and it worked for about a week or so, but then it went completely dead. We don't spend a lot of time on the phone, so it's not like we overused it to death in a matter of weeks. Very disappointed with this phone. I'd rate it 0 stars if that option were available"
1,Great phone - if you want to sound like you are talking in a,"This is the worse piece of junk I have ever bought, AT&T should be ashamed of themselves!!!!! The battery life is really short, it disconnects the call when you answer but worse than all that I feel like I am talking in a tunnel. I am now searching to replace this phone!"
2,ATT&T the low end,"When I ordered this phone I put too much trust in the ATT&T brand. It feels so light it's like a toy and slippery to hold. It doesn't easy sit in the base and as a result when it's hung up it often doesn't sit in the cradle to recharge correctly. I revisted the site, carefully read customer reviews and found them very insightful. Amazon provided excellent service and allowed me to return it and order a new phone which I am very pleased with."
4,Annette Ultimate Collection,I like the CD. One disappointment for me was that O Dio Mio is sung in Italian and not English. It's still a timeless beautiful melody.
5,Purchased for someone else,"The book was purchased through my account for a co-worker. She had the library's book, so when I showed her the price, she wanted her own. She gives the book glowing reviews and says it is wonderful and easy to understand."
3,"Not really good, not really bad...","Last year I was a beginner on the topic of AS/400 and I bought this book, because it was the only AS/400 book I could find in Denmark. What I need was a exact description, telling me precisely what to do, when I had to do something on the AS/400. I could use the book for that, because I didn't want to read manuals or take a course in computer operations systems. The book has only 490 pages, not 600 pages!"
2,Left much to be desired,"I bought this book because no others were avalable in Australia and I regreted it. It was poorly designed and structured. The concepts are not clearly explained. After reading half of the book, all I've learn are a few commands and menu ... What I need is understanding the operating system at least at the basic level, not just ""if you want to do this, type this at the command line then press Enter ..."""
1,"Shame on MA bell, what happened to Western Electric?","The worst cordless phone I have ever owned. It buzzed. Its sound quality sounded like the PA system on a comercial jet. And to add insult to injury, when you dial it makes this ridiculously loud chirping sound, which cannot be defeated, anouncing to everyone in the house that you are making a call! A piece of crap I returned it promply."
4,Very good features with one annoyance,"PROS:1) Lots of features and easy to use.2) Good sound (for a cordless) on the phone and better than average sound (for digital) on the answering machine.CONS:I've only discovered one serious one, which many others here have mentioned: there is a delay of one or two seconds for a dial tone or when answering a call.Another complaint several people here have made is that both the base and the handset ring (alternately) by default, and this is indeed *very* annoying. However, what no one so far has mentioned is that you can *turn off* the base ringer leaving only the handset ringer on, thereby eliminating this problem completely."
3,Book for a new start,"I really enjoyed reading Tanenbaums' books. He rally has a way to teach things. For the comment, this book is a starters book; To understand what is what in the networking world. I advise to people read this book before they sleep so that they will learn after a week, how interesting this Networking World is. For the intermediate readers this book could revive their lack of knowledge on some specific fields.. But as for the Advanced I do not recommend this book"
3,Decent introductionary level network book,The book covers most widespread network configurations on an introductionary level. Unfortunatly Mr. Tanenbaums personal oppinion shines through and give the book a hint of subjectivity. The book even contains errors due to poor research
2,Should improve the spray,"I bought the face water because the product doesn't have a toner. Good to know that the product has no chemical. It has gentle scent that I like. Unfortunately, it's not so comfortable to be used as a hydrating water cause the spray is too strong. It doesn't come out fine and misty which I'd expect and once you spray it, the water trickles down your face. I guess the best way is to spray it on your palm and pat it on your face.In terms of hydrating capability, I'd say it's just a temporary relief."
5,The ultimate gerbil book !!,"If you are looking for the best gerbil care book, look no further.This is the ultimate gerbil care book. It is very easy to read, full of reliable information and great pictures. The best of all, throughout the book you feel Donna's love for gerbils. I strongly recommend this book for all gerbil lovers young and old."
3,Adult Story of Spiritual Struggle,"Imaginative and brutally realistic, this novel surprised me. The spiritual struggle of the individual is thoughtfully depicted and the realistic description of the End Times is totally honest. This is a troubling, hard-edged, hard-to-take story, for adult readers who are prepared for a challenge. The author has written a book that has made me reflect on my own faith and stop and seriously think. In that way, this flawed but powerful novel is very worthwhile. Disturbing, realistic, and quite interesting."
3,Fakebook serves up fake pop,"If your favorite band of the 90's is Weezer then you'll love Ultimate Fakebook. This NYC trio playfully serves up the same brand of faux-pop confections. Unfortunately, these guys lack the genius of Rivers Cuomo so instead of instant classics you get generic-sounding but still radio-friendly variations on classic pop themes - the lonely-boy-wants-a-girlfriend ballad, the harmony-laden Beach Boys surf-pop ditty, the New Wavey bubblegum pop tune. Ultimate Fakebook doesn't quality as ultimate anything but a whole of what they play sure sounds fake."
2,Not Sturdy Enough for Nearly Everyday Usage,"Given the location of our mailbox, I wanted a key chain where I could detach part of it so I could keep the car running while I step out and get the mail. I bought this one mostly for it's size. I didn't want anything too big. Even with some of the bad reviews, I decided to take a chance. I would only be detaching it four to five days a week, I would make a point of being gentle, and figured with only a small mailbox key it wouldn't see a lot of wear-and-tear. Unfortunately after only two months of use the release mechanism fell apart. One of the ball bearings was dislodged and lost. It instantly became useless to me because it would no longer hold together.It's a good idea, but just not sturdy enough for such use. It might work for those that aren't using the release mechanism as much, maybe a couple of times a month or so."
1,Don't waste your money on this book,"This book is very poorly written with numerous technical errors. The illustrations are poorly done and the photographs are fuzzy and grainy.I repair electric motors as a hobby, and could find nothing of value in this book. One would be much better off buying Rosenbergs ""Electric Motor Repair"" through a used book store or online."
5,Not only for beginners,"This is a very good book for those just beginning on the road to being a great cook, but it has a lot of little thoughts and reminders for everyone. Enjoying this one immensely."
1,NOT BPA-free!,I was disappointed to have purchased this water bottle with the understanding that it was BPA-free but recently SIGG has come out with a statement saying it is not. You havee to look at the color of the lining to determine if it is the old or new lining. This one has the old lining.
1,An absolute ripoff,The book is very good and deserves five stars. However the audio version is extremely abridged and in only 4 hours long where the audio version of the book is almost fifty hours long. The video version is over 6 hours so this little audio version contains 1/10 of the story.
4,Other ending?,"I very much enjoyed this book, as have the other reviewers. But I just wonder what the original ending was? From what I understand, this ending was created for a later publication than the original. If you've read the other version, please contact me.I did learn a lot from this book, including the practice of suttee, geography of the India peninsula. I give it 4 stars because I think a map would have greatly enhanced my understanding. I referred to my globe, but the times have changed."
5,Best Novel Ever,"What Gone with the Wind: (is to) USA; The Far Pavilions: (is to) India. Ashton and Anjuli are characters which speak to us. The narrative is easy to understand and makes this book a must-read.What further encapsulates us is the fact that it is not fiction. And is based on actual events which M.M.Kaye first heard from one of her servants (while she was visiting India) and came across the story in an English armymen's diary.A beautiful saga, it will leave you wanting more."
5,The Buffalo Wolf,"I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever heard a wolf howl or to anyone who has ever dreamed of hearing a wolf howl! Lu Carbyn is a man of science who writes with a poet's skill. His knowledge paired with his compassion takes us to the mysterious and ever-changing world of the Buffalo Wolf National Park, one of our world's treasures. The predator/prey interactions, the politics of wildlife management, the basic and sometimes cruel ways of nature -- Lu presents these issues and challenges us to ask the question, ""How much management is too much?"" Truly a spectacular book!"
3,makes one think,"I bought this book out of curiosity, and while I'm not sure I buy everything in it, the story (or set of circumstances) makes one think about life after death and the possiblility of a different exsistance than what the religions would teach. If nothing else, this book lends to discussions and deeper thinking - whether you accept her 'truths' or not. My only crit. is that the same story could've been told without using Princess Diana as reference - but then again, Auntie M's story wouldn't have sold as many copies as Di's"
4,A Superbly Taut Mystery from one of Today's Best Writers,"At first, I had my doubts about the mundane setting of a Bronx nursing home, but S.J. Rozan surprised me in the end. His old mentor has asked Bill Smith for a favor--to look into the murder of a security guard at the home. After including his partner, Lydia Chin, and some poking around, another murder occurs, much like the first one, with the victim being beaten to death. The characters that Bill Smith meets in his investigation of two murders are well-written and play an instrumental role in the solution of the case. The plot is well honed, and Rozan's dialogue is equally compelling. But it is the ending of this mystery where Rozan shines. She not only neatly wraps up the case but also the fragments of Bill Smith's life that have unraveled since the start of the investigation."
5,I couldn't stop thinking about the characters...,"I stayed up late to finish this book, and woke up the next morning still thinking about the characters- the gang leader ""Snake"" and the bitter cop, in particular. Rozan has successfully pulled off a rather difficult trick- changing the point of view in the middle of a series. Much to my surprise, I liked Bill Smith as a protaganist just as well- perhaps even a bit better than Lydia Chin. I've enjoyed them all so far, however. But Concourse soars above the average mystery in its superb character development. I'm looking forward to more from S.J. Rozan!"
5,Like nothing I have ever read before,"I had the honor of hearing Mr. Salsitz speak recently. I was amazed by his story and I wanted to know more so I bought this book. He has a keen memory, and he paints a clear picture of life during his childhood in the backwards town of Kolbuszowa. The book is always interesting and the story it tells is fascinating. I encourage everyone to read this first-hand account of this little slice of life as it existed before the Holocaust."
2,Too many songs repeating themselves...,"His songs are ok, but they are all almost exactly alike. There are only 3 truly good songs on this CD: 'It Wasn't Me', 'Angel', and 'Dance and Shout'. Unless you want to hear a lot of repetition, don't buy it. And, on my CD I have a bonus track...'Chica Bonita'...skip right past it, please."
1,A total loser of an album,"My wife had this album as she felt that she needed it to be cool. Honey let me tell you owning this album doesn't make you cool. It's mindless ska rhythms, and a warbling voice to go with it. None of the songs on here are good. I'd give this a zero, but there's no rating for zero. I heard some of these songs on the radio like ""It Wasn't Me"", and ""Angel"", and I'm like ""What's music coming to?"" From the late 90's up till today music just hasn't been the same. This will definitely in my opinion go down as the worst album of this decade. I know that Shaggy was a Marine, so I just want to say ""Semper Fi"", but this album is horrible."
5,The wait was worth it!,Shaggy comes back strong with Hot Shot. This CD is for the lovers as well as the friends. This CD is so diverse and yet so appealing to everyone. I loved the way he talks about life situations in his songs. This CD is wonderful. I recommend it to everyone who loves just to listen to music.
4,great album,"I totally underestimated this album right before I got it. Great beats, lyrics, and unlike most of my cds, it's actually made clean. Best songs are 1,2,3,5,7,9,10,11, and 13."
4,Great love music,"Yeah, my girlfriend loves this too. We mack to this non stop. Not Fair is the coolest song on the CD, but most others are very good."
4,A very high quality medical tape!,"3M Transpore medical tape is a very high quality product that holds well, is water resistant, and tears cleanly without scissors. In exchange for these benefits, there is a small issue. After the tape is removed, there is some residue of the adhesive that remains behind. The only way I was able to remove this cleanly was with nail polish remover. Overall, recommended."
1,very bad reaction,"I got a spider bite on my ankle and was covering it with honey-soaked cotton held in place with Johnson & Johnson First Aid Paper Tape. The bite was getting better and then I ran out of paper tape. So I stated using a roll of 3M Transpore tape. After a day or two, I got a huge, horrible skin reaction everywhere (and only) where the tape contacted my skin. Massive irritation and severe sores, which eventually scabbed over and left major scars which are still extremely prominent six months later. It was the worst skin reaction I've ever gotten from contact with anything. Obviously my reaction is rare, but should be mentioned because it did happen and the Transpore tape was the obvious culprit. I got some more paper tape and experienced no further irritation with it."
5,Better value. Not individually wrapped.,"I bought this bulk box of tape since it was only a few bucks more expensive than a retail package of 2 rolls. I used them to protect against nipple chaffing while training for and running a half-marathon.Pros: strong hold, stays in place despite sweat and moisture, comes off cleanly without any sticky residue.Cons: Since there's no non-adhesive center like small circular band-aids or nip-guards, the removal process is a little uncomfortable"
1,"Hamsun raves about ""ignorant America""","This really isn't a book, when you consider the literary masterpieces Knut Hamsun has penned. It's just a collection of ravings about how culturally ignorant America is. Later in life, Hamsun regretted writing it & apologised for the mean-spirited vindictiveness of the work. If you're like me, & want to read everything Hamsun has written, sure, go for it. Love America bashing? You'll love it. If neither of those situations apply, I'd strongly suggest not wasting the money on this work when there are so many other quality works available for purchase."
1,"Bad movie, unfunny.","Since I'm a fan of American Pie, I thought this was going to be similar, but, it's pathetic, I forced my way to watch it. The plot, the script, the performance and all the execution is lousy! Waste of time."
4,Unexpectedly Funny,I caught bits of this movie on late night TV which of course was edited. Each time it went to commercial I flipped to something else but would eventually come back to it and each time found myself laughing out loud. I had to search it out and watch the entire unrated version and wasn't disappointed. This movie won't change your life or solve the worlds problems but if you need a good laugh and are not bothered by somewhat gross and/or suggestive humor I highly recommend it.
2,"What You Get Is Good, But....","This is a very misleading item. First, I received four filters(solid blue, yellow, red and green?) No grey-ish one that softens the edges, which I was hoping for. In the picture you see a little clear circle in the center, but I got solid-color filters. I'm not hugely disappointed because all in all they work and are basically what I wanted but not exactly. Kinda peeved about the grey filter. Also, I'm surprised there aren't more reviews like mine. Maybe it's a fluke?"
2,Doesn't come with the holder!?,"The filters seem nice enough, if you can find the attachment that you need to purchase (SEPARATELY!) in order to actually use them!Oh well, next time I'll be more careful than to assume that the piece that you NEED will come with the filters."
5,Drove Me Buggy (but that's a good thing)!,"I loved it. I'm sure I didn't understand all Vollmann wanted me to. The writing style, while difficult, is extraordinary.I do not have the literary background to do justice to any deep analysis, so I'll just give you a reader's appraisal. The closest comparison I can make is to David Foster Wallace's ""Infinite Jest"". The method of writing and the characters reminded me of ""IJ"" within a very few pages. I feel safe in saying that if you do not care for DFW, you will not care for this book.We are taken on a journey in an unrecognizable USA (and world). There is a bare bones description of what is happening to people and places other than that necessary for us to follow the characters through their travails. The list of characters at the beginning is of benefit so you can remind yourself of who is on what team.To put it in a nutshell - I had fun reading this, which is my goal with any book I read."
2,I have seen better,"If you want a ""good"" digital camera, dont buy this one. Its ok for close ups only. You can play with taking different pictures like: negative, sepia, black & white, solarized, plastel, regular and sketch photos. If you scrapbook and want a different look for your layouts, this is ok. But this is about all I use it for. The buttons and dials are so small and very easy to hit something else because there so sensative. It says digital zoom is 4X but then its so grainy you cant see well. And make sure what-ever you are taking pics of is really well lit or that wont work either. Better yet, just take outside pics.You are better off getting the Kodak Easyshare Z740 which is much better and alot easier to use."
2,Not worth buying yet,"What if?They included an FM radio with preset stationsAn optical view finderSome 4X level of optical zoomingEnsured constant production quality (early production line was crap)Then it would be worth buying, even at a higher price.Hope Mustek engineering read this, and act on it for the announced revamp of the product in August 2005."
1,MUSTEK GARBAGE,"The DV5500 is a piece of garbage _ the day I got it it wouldn't focus right and I called for help and they told me I was shaking and that's why pictures weren't clear, I used the tripod and took a video and it did improve somewhat, I put the camera in it's docking station and about 5 months later tried to use it again and found out it WAS NOT FOCUSING AT ALL so I called them again, the FIRST thing they asked was WHEN I bought it and since it was over a year, they said it was OUT OF WARRANTY and they DID NOT FIX any out of warrantry cameras, in other words THROW it AWAY because no one else does either. I wouldn't buy another MUSTEK product if they gave it away"
1,Unwatchable,The format for this product is not supported by any DVD or Blu-Ray player that I or any of my family members or friends own.So frustrating; especially since I gave it to my father as a Christmas gift!
4,Get the job done,"These are.. alright. They bend out of shape REALLY easily, but with so many in the package you can just discard the bent ones. They hold in place well, if you know how to secure them properly. The paint on the pins is pretty great, with my dark hair they go un-noticeable."
4,Sherlock Holmes,This item was a gift for my brother. He watched the movies and really enjoyed them. The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because I didn't watch it and can't accurately rate the item.
5,Young Godfather,"This dvd is one of the earliest live shows of James that I've seen so far. If only this technology was available back in 1963 when James in his prime. But The Godfather has gone through so many transformations, only a true fan would know what period WAS his prime! Just imagine this...this dvd of his performance is only a small part of a show that he use to put on. Much more dancing, more dynamics with the band and a much better band! But for JB fans who have only recently been converted in the last 20 years! LOL! This is still a great dvd! BUY IT! And then search for more!"
1,BRAIN DEAD,Your brain will work just fine with out this mumbo-jumbo --- don't waste your money ---- buy one of Enya's CD'S instead!
5,Excellent historical fiction,"The paths of a Mescalero Apache boy and an Anglo settler girl cross in New Mexico territory in 1881 when both lay claim to a beautiful black-and-white horse. This horse story, survival story, and early-day settler story is historically and geographically accurate. The contrast in points of view of the boy and the girl makes this novel above average. Representation of the American Indian boys as realistic characters with differing personalities and varying reactions to their miserable treatment on the reservation is outstanding. Recommended for readers of all ages."
3,Not too original,"It seems harder and harder for bands these days to find their own sound. Acceptance is no exception, seeing as they sound almost identical to The Get Up Kids and Jimmy Eat World. Basically, these songs sound like B sides for ""Something to Write Home About"". So why the three stars for a band that so obviously is jumping on the emo pop bandwagon? Well, I'm a sucker for good pop rock, and ""I Believe"" and ""December"" are good songs that stand on their own. As this band matures, they'll probably be awesome. But as for this album, there are twenty better discs out there that do the same thing better."
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing. The book seemed to plod along with no emotion whether the main character was falling in love or being raped. The descriptions of the landscape, food, clothes, and everything else seemed very clear but I felt no connection to the people. Perhaps it was a problem with the translation."
3,Possible great story ruined by underdeveloped characters...,"Although I really enjoyed this sort of ""third party"" take on the story of Noah's Ark and found the tale in general an interesting one, I cannot bring myself to give this novel more than three stars.Personally, I felt as if the characters were either undeveloped or not developed at all. Re Jana, being the main character, did not awaken much feeling in me, and I did not feel as if Ham was given any personalization at all. Neelata simply confused me. I found myself wondering if something was lost in the translation of this book, because how could an author come up with such a good plot line and yet not awaken any feeling for her characters? Unfortunately, I can't read Dutch, and I'm pretty sure that's the original language this book was published in."
2,Didn't Hold Up,Got this pillow in October of 2011. It was fine for awhile but then lost its form within about 6 months. I would not recommend it.
4,Seems to work,"I haven't yet gone through a 'detox' regimen with this product yet, but I must say that it definitely has an impact on the digestive system. I wouldn't use it for an extremely prolonged period of time due to the warnings on the back of one of the bottles, but for what it's worth, I'm glad I bought it."
2,Gave me bad acne,"I've been on this product for over a week and all it's done is give me really bad breakouts, so bad, I haven't left my house all week. I only go to the restroom once a day vs. the two before this product. I guess it's not for everyone and not only am I disappointed, my week was ruined due to bad skin, which is just now beginning to get slightly better."
2,Did not work for me.,"I hate to give this product a bad review because it seems like a good company with good prices and environmentally-responsible practices. But this product just didn't work for me, even at the maximum dosage of 6 pills twice a day. All I got was bad gas cramps. In fact I may have been a little more constipated than usual (sorry to be so graphic, but hey it's a colon cleanser!) The instructions say some people just have ""sluggish colons"" and they need to use the company's Super Cleanse product, but since UC didn't work even slightly, I'm reluctant to try any more of their products. The 2 stars is for the good value price for quantity of pills and the large variety of natural ingredients. I bought another herbal product called Colon Clenz at Wal-Mart that works much better, although it's just for 1- or 2-day use, not meant to be a whole-body detoxifier like UC."
2,Just Starting,"I have been researching hard to find helpful reviews or before and after pics but apparently this product actually is a secret. Day one went well, although I did have 2 laxatives the night before , I had 4 poops. Day 2 nothing after 5 hours so I took some MOM and 4 movements. Maybe I should boost my intake to 3 of each...."
4,Very Helpful,"After signing up for a Latin class at our local Junior College, I was sad to be informed by the professor that Latin is considered a dead language. I was sorry to hear that as it was really fun to listen to the tapes and follow along in the booklet. That was the easy part.Latin itself is a very complicated language in my opinion and makes Mandarin look like a piece of cake!I would definately recommend this material for anyone intersested in learning a little about Latin including every day phrases and some useful quotes to spring on your friends!"
4,Good basic introduction to music theory,"This is a simple, straightforward introduction to the language and concepts of music theory, including topics such as musical notation, scales, intervals, modes, and chords. It's suitable for reading straight through as an overview of the subject, and useful to keep on hand for quick reference. Explanations are clear, concise, and easy to understand, and thorough index and table of contents listings make it easy to find information on any of the topics covered. Its compact size (63 pp. and about 6.5 in./17 cm. tall) is another plus. Recommended for beginning musicians or anyone else who wants to understand music theory concepts and/or learn to read music."
1,Wouldn't even give 1/2 star,"I don't believe this thing ... I just been to Benny Hinn crusade last night (January 23, 2004) in Orlando, Florida at T.D Waterhouse Centre ... I saw people getting healed and I felt the presence of the Holy Spirit ...Pastor Benny Hinn was given gift from God according to the 1Corinthians 12:8-11, those people who wrote this book won't believe the miracle of healing or miracle from God, Holy Spirit, and Jesus Christ?!?!?All things are possible with God (Matthew 19:26) ... how could Pastor Benny Hinn heal people without God? Without God it would be Impossible for him. (Matthew 19:26)RECOMMENDED READING: Good Morning Holy Spirit, and Welcome Holy Spirit by Pastor Benny Hinn then this book and recommended you to visit Benny Hinn crusade ... I've been blessed A LOT ... I could feel the Holy Spirit in the Crusade"
3,two out of three ain't bad,"At first listening, the songs on this new album sounded very flat and failed to expand as the songs progressed, as one would expect listening to previous Underworld.Overall, i was disappointed the first time simply because it wasn't something i'm used to. Underworld has an uncanny ability to grow on its listeners, but they definitely have a long way to go with this new sound."
2,tedious...,"what a disappointment this is. unfortunately it doesnt get better with time either. after a few listens it loses the initial catchiness distinguished by ""two months off"" and ""mo move"" and after 2 weeks i dont want to play it again at all.""little speaker"", a track with a very Steve Reich inspired sound, would be pleasant enough without the annoying female voice. ""trim"" is truly awful - underworld does dallas,whatever!the rest i barely recall. I have everything else Underworld have released and play them all over and over so I defintiely agree with those who think this isnt up to scratch."
3,Could go either way on this.,"I have a feeling I'm going to have to listen to AHDO a few times before I finally figure out if I like it or not. I'm a huge Underworld fan (I must have had Second Toughest of the Infants in my cd player for five months straight after I bought it) and maybe listening to Everything, Everything for so long has left me wanting for something more......alive, I guess. Don't get me wrong, AHDO is as solid as any of their earlier efforts, but so far, it's leaving me a bit ""eh."" There doesn't seem to be much progression at all from Beaucoup Fish, but while it is good stuff, and I will listen to this album as much as their earlier ones, I still feel let down. I think I just got too excited about a new Underworld album, and built it up too much internally."
3,Good but not the best,"As an avid listener of Underworld I was slightly disappointed by ""A Hundred Days Off"". The album seemed to lack the spark and drive which had prevailed in both ""Beaucoup Fish"" and ""Dubnobasswithmyheadman"". Underworld uses repetitive qualities in their albums to maintain a cohesive rhythm in the songs and to hold the listener's attention. In most cases, they are extremely sucessful in creating tension and climax as well as pumping the listener full of adrenaline. While ""A Hundred Days Off"" employs catchy beats, it's repetitive qualites become rather annoying at times, rather than exciting. If you're a newcomer to Underworld I would recommend ""Dubnobasswithmyheadman"" first as opposed to this album. But if you're a die hard Underworld fan this is still a must for the collection."
2,Blech,"I have the biggest crush on Darren Emerson and as far as I am concerned, he IS UNDERWORLD. Sorry, but its true... this album is only the tip of the iceberg that the UNDERWORLD used to be Besides... giving Karl Hyde more creative control shows through in this album.... Darren COME BACK!I guess I will be buying more Darren Emerson CDS from now on then."
1,A dud,"Another ""it's all about me"" mystery detective. Too much about the main character and not enough about the crime in this book. Bretta is snobbish and smug - full of herself throughout the book. Everybody likes her, she's the only one in the book who ""knows"" things, the only one people confide in, the only one who can communicate effectively with the Amish, and so on. She constantly takes offense when people notice she's lost weight, but, let's face it - you don't loose 100 pounds overnight and surely some of these people have noticed it by now? I never felt any emotion for the character who gets killed even though he left behind a widow and some children and all the dialogue seems stilted and forced. That's why I gave it a one."
4,GARDENING MYSTERY #1,Fun Start of a series - the Gardening Mysteries. Bretta Solomon is a force to be reckoned with. She owns a flower shop where Lois works. This story is about the death of Isaac an Amish man that she has known for many years who is in the flower growing business.
2,"2.5 stars, actually","This is a decent volume from Hugh McDonald. It's a ""good read"" but, factually, it's 'erratic.' That said, some interesting info. on Saul and especially the concept of Oswald believing the assassination (attempt) in Dallas was a Secret Service security test (echoes of what is also said in Farewell America and my book...)[...]"
1,:/ Not a good read,"Thought I was buying a Philippa Gregory novel as it was lumped in with her books. Bought this by mistake and I regretted it. VERY dry and (in my opinion), not entertaining at all."
2,Not for the homeowner,"If like me you're a homeowner looking for advice how to tune up your oil burner, don't waste your time with this book. It's some sort of study guide for tradesmen and did not answer my questions."
1,Doesn't work,"I was looking for something besides saline spray which doesnt seem to me to work at all, plus saline dries my nose out. I tried this Seagate Olive Leaf. I really tried to give it a go, but it just doesnt work. My nose is just as stuffy as it was. At this point I really dont think there are any natural cures for a stuffy nose other than time and patience, but when my nose is blocked I am in the mood for neither. I want relief. The only real relief is probably Rhinocort or Nasacort."
3,Does not seem to do much for me.,"I have a pretty serious sinus problem. Had sinusitis for over 10 years before I had the frontal sinus surgery to clear out the chambers beneath the eyes. As a result, I have allergies ever since. The doctor warned me beforehand. But it is a trade off that I was willing to take. Anad very rarely, I have flare ups.I bought it during one of those flare ups. I used it in conjunction with salt water rinse, not the same time. Did not feel much difference. Then I used it during Spring, heavy allergy, did not help me much either.Does it really work? I have no clue. I felt better spraying it into my nose. Placebo effect? Mabye. But I found that having a regular and healthy lifestyle is far superior to all these sprays. Your body's natural defense still better."
2,Didn't work for me.,Pretty expensive product especially since it didn't work. Used it for a week with no results.Complete waste of money.
3,just ok,"It didnt smell, like other products I have tried. But It didnt work for me. It made the spots not so itchy but didnt stop them from spreading."
1,Does not work!!,"I have used that, but not seen any benefit.. Waste of money for me.. Everybody has different skin, it may work you.."
2,Really not our taste,I ordered this book based on a review by Violet Blue thinking it was something my wife and I would enjoy reading together. Other than one or two stories it really doesn't appeal to our taste. The stories are diverse enough that a review based on one or two stories does not give a very accurate overview of the content.
1,Terrible...,"Ridiculously difficult to use. I bought it to use RPN, and 3D graphing, which it does, but for everything else it is a waste. Unless you know someone who knows how to use it and can show you how, don't buy it. The manual is inadequate, the online .pdf is 900 pages and still doesn't tell you how to do simple things, like solve a linear system of equations. Buy a TI-89."
4,HP 50g,HP 50g Graphing Calculator (F2229AA#ABA)The # 9 key didn't work. HP was out of stock and no known date for receiving more. Amazon took it back and within a couple of days I had a new one!
4,Great value with a great deal of potential,"This calculator is a value. Documentation on how to interface this calculator to the home computer could be improved. However, documentation for an versital tool of a machine like this is a challenge."
5,Much better,"I have used HP calulators since 1973. I own a 49G and a 49G+. The keyboards of these products left a lot to be desired. Even though the 50g is virtully identical to the 49G+, the keyboard and display are much improved. The 50g also has a better look and feel than th 49G+. It reminds me of the old HP quality."
5,"Love the RPN mode, even as a new user!","For the longest time, I could not decide on this or a TI for my mechanical engineering degree, but my friend talked me into this based on the advanced functions. After he showed me how to use the RPN mode I was blown away and am very happy with this calculator. Many options and small learning curve. I owned a TI-83 plus for years but it broke last year and I'm glad I replaced it with this beast."
1,Bummer,"My HP48 from 1990 just died and I bought the 50g thinking 20 years of upgrade must be in it. Not the case. The biggest bummer is the enter key is moved to the lower right corner and made small which makes this a one handed calculator. The previous 48 layout I could input calculations as fast as I could think, with two hands. This is slow and cumbersome ergonomics, I guess for doing slow and cumbersome calculations."
4,It is what I expected,"Simply match the expectations I had on this, but I thought the screen looked better..."
4,excelente para los estudiantes de ingeniería,"Muy buen producto, para los estudiantes de ingeniería, excelente para graficar y calcular. Cumplió con las expectativas de mi hermana"
3,Robben Fleming's Tempests into Rainbows,"Robben Fleming's autobiography is well-done and well-written. It is interesting to read the personal history of one who has lived most of this century and who certainly has been an influential university president.The Tempests part relates primarily to the time in the late fifties and sixties, when there were student riots, black rights movement, sit-down strikes and the like. Mr. Fleming takes credit for alleviating the impact of the rioting & the unrest on the campus.This publication is recommended for those who enjoy reading biographies, for those who are interested in the sixties (particularly from the non-student point of view), and for those who are interested in the history of Michigan universities."
5,"I cant wait for No way Out, Jana, Dari an Kari stories.","Freaking great books. Okay, the seduction, big man, small girls, capturing from earth and such are the same. But, the plots, the characters, the development of what could be very repetitive is just so great. She can make erotic to become funny. She can make erotic to be very hot. She can write about people that are very interesting. I am hooked I may say and I I saw on her web page that the next book is no way out: Jana, then No Way Out: Dari, then No way Out: Kari and then No way out: Armageddon and I can't help but to hope she will release them all in a large book so I can read it soon.:D :D"
3,So-So,"I love this series, but this book left me cold.After all that build up,then nothing.Cam and Kara's conflict was so anticlimactic that I was left wondering what Jaid Black was thinking.Kara kisses Cam's feet, then they kinda talk, and then everythings better.Huh?I don't know about you but I'm not buying it.Than there was Jek's story.Funny, yes anything after that, no.The whole story was almost a waste.If it wasn't for the parts about the family I would have skiped it.All in all the sex was hot, but more of the same.It was all very disappointing."
1,I'm am so diapointed!!!!!!!!!,Let me start but saying that i love Jaid Black and I love a lot of her books. But this book I did not like at all. I have two other of her trek books so I do know that i would be missing book three so I know there would be a jump. but this one. In both books she jump from the main story to subplots and simed to focus more on them than on the main story (I think she was tring to set up the final book which so far five years later she has not written) Me I am going to wait (maybe I don't think she is going to) for the final book.
5,Best work KMFDM has done in years,"This is one of my favorite CDs. My others are Adios and MDFMK's debut album both of which I would recommend. First of all the whole CD is great but my favorite songs are Anarchy, Megalomaniac, Spit Sperm, and Waste. The whole KMFDM crew collaborating with Raymond Watts from PIG, Ogre from Skinny Puppy, and Bill Rieflin from Ministry is pure genius and how could I forget Tim Skold's KMFDM debut with Anarchy. I would definitely recommend that everyone buy this CD."
2,Hate to admit it was disappointing . . .,"I was looking forward to Toby's new album but was sort of disappointed after hearing it. I agree with Mr. Ryan Staples as most of the songs do sound ""forced and redundant, like he had a deadline."" It's not like his old stuff at all and absolutely nothing compared to DC Talk when Toby was at his best. 'Lose My Soul' was pretty good and is worth a listen, but he's changed his style too much for an old Tobymac fan to enjoy."
5,"Watch it yourself, encourage others to watch it",Returning American veterans struggle to find within themselves the courage and the clarity to challenge a corrupt political system. Very inspiring movie for our troubled times.
5,Watch & see why we must always have the Second Ammendment !!!!,A great movie about a real life story. Well done. A must watch for anyone not believing in the Second Ammendnent to the Constitution! I will pass it on to my friends and family . It brought tears to these 69 year old eyes !!!I don't think you will be disappointed .
3,Terrific book but where is the index!,"I found the information and recipes in this book terrific but was very frustrated by the lack of an index which can make locating information or recipes very difficult! WE NEED AN INDEX!On the other hand, the information and recipes are 5-star. This is an ""easy to live with"" 40-30-30 plan. Recipes are delicious and easy to make."
1,"moronic writing, misleading advice","I was profoundly disappointed by this book, which reads as if it were written by a bad artificial intelligence program. The entire CONTENT of the book could have taken up about ten pages -- the rest of it consists of the SAME tired sentences, repeated (I kid you not) WORD FOR WORD -- like a dense seventh grader trying to fill up the required pages in a book report. But that's not all: the diet plan itself is needlessly complex and misleading. Any weight you lose on this plan will be lost because the diet is VERY low in calories -- not because of the wacky combination of foods the Daousts (or the AI programs behind them) suggest. Save your money; save your time."
1,nothing new here!!!!!!!!!,you can find these same shows on other collections and they will look better and have more shows than this sad little set!!!!!
1,Stay away from this table!,"Beware this table is highly unstable! After spending hours of diligent attention to every detail of the assembly instructions, we witnessed the table support literally fall out from under the table. The thin metal-like hinges that form the foundation for the thin legs are much too fragile and appear to be made of tin. If you can believe it, the instructions provided with the table expect you to assemble the table upside down and then lift and flip the entire assembled table onto its legs without bending the table halves themselves or any of the flimsy legs/struts! We ended up salvaging the table tops and purchasing 4 very stable saw-horses that when placed strategically, provide an excellent support for the table (I spent $160 extra for the saw-horses)."
4,"Carlos Kleiber ""Traces to nowhere""","Carlos Kleiber (and also his father Eric) were absolutely great conductors and I always enjoy very much Carlos' recordings (DVD and CD). There is,for me, one unanswered question:Why did he conduct and record so little? Maybe the answer would be similar to the same question about Glenn Gould. Did ""we"" not always understand their ""souls""? Both biographical DVD about Carlos Kleiber (Traces to nowhere and I am lost to the world) are very good but somewhat repetitive. And their prices are steep if we consider there is relatively little music."
3,Necessary Purchase,"This book will not only teach you everything you need to know, and reinforce what you may already be doing... but will do it in a fun way that will convey the point humorously. A must-read for EVERYONE in the sales or recruitment field. Fabulously written, and extremely knowledgeable. This book also includes a fantastic questionaire section that will teach you how to properly interview, select and retain excellent salespeople!"
3,nothing special.......,"autechre's complete body of works is amazing, but this release tends to remain as their most unintresting piece. All their other albums jump out and grab me, this one has not as of yet, and I doubt it will.I personally believe this album has been hinded by autechre's other works, had it been by another artist it would be amazing, but comparing it to other auetchre albums it's not impressive.Check out Amber, LP5, Chiastic slide and EP7 for a better indication of what autechre are about....."
3,Think Aphex Twin Sedated,"This isn't bad IDM music, but it just doesn't keep my interest. Unlike Aphex Twin, where you listen to one of his CD's 1000 times and still don't know what to expect. This CD is just to predictable and to forgettable. You sit and wait for something to happen and it never does. Looks like I have to disagree with all these Autechre nuts. This albums not bad, it's just to bland for my taste. It's got the nice sounds of thrilling IDM music, but it never lives up to it's true potential. Try their self-titled CD instead, and only buy this if you are a Autechre lover that can't live without this release."
2,Pretty Boring,"I imagine anyone who ""raved"" about this stopped listening to it soon after (6 months, a year) while those of us who rememeber the release of Eno's On Land Still listen 20+ years later (yeah, I'm pretty old but you'll understand how fleeting enthusiasms can be someday). This will will not stand the test of time. I'm getting rid of it to make space for something interesting. Sure its better than whatever pop music is hot now but not by much."
2,Same as the Brady Text,This book is not much better than having the Brady text. The answers are not explained and you can argue many of them
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this DVD, thinking it would be a professional TV program about the Anglo-Saxons. Instead, it is a home-video type production, simply showing the named presenter making a PowerPoint presentation to a small audience. Not recommended."
4,a better textbook,"The chapters are short, which was a wise decision to allow for students to be able to learn the subject, while not boring them to death."
1,Mind Numbingly Boring and Elementary,"I used this text for a university general education requirement. Unfortunately, I had already learned how to read graphs in grade school. The chi-squared test introduced almost last in the text is taught the during the first week in any genetics course. This is a book not worthy to be purchased and I hope college professors avoid this text."
4,salads,Great sald dressing. I would liked a longer than 6 month (use by) because there are only 2 of us.
4,Marianna Butterfly Clamps Large 12-pk,"My only problem was the colors were different of the clips versus the picture. However, they refunded me in full and let me keep the clips so no complaint here after that was done. However, in the future the picture should match what your selling or at least state that colors may vary from what is shown just so there is no confusion in the future.Thanks"
3,Wrong Color. Great Product,"I am pleased with the quality of these clips. They're durable and good quality. I was not shipped the colors featured on the Amazon page, but fortunately I like the colors they sent me better than the colors on the product page. I do think they should alert customers that color could vary, as someone may be ordering this product for these specific colors. The product description says ""assorted colors"" but it does not specify that you will get colors other than the ones featured on the page. I got translucent pink, purple, orange, and green."
4,Happy,"I've been looking for these for a while, glad when I saw them on her and got them in good time."
3,Major Motion Picture Actres,"This book has been finding it's way at some Hollywood parties and is quite entertaining with alot of ""stars"" and producers. A certain respected actor who shall remain nameless, said after reading Gutierrez book, ""We all knew what was happening, but reading the details was quite interesting."" It's pulp style can only be regarded as LULU'esque. Maybe some more stories will find thier way to back to Jaque von Wasabee and a script will emerge from the green color. See how many read Victor Come Home Campaign, and dont forget to check out ""where's my money MF?"" Just Kidding. and dont forget to talk about these recent topics.I also found ""If you were GOOD!, you could have some"", by Victor Gutierrez to be facinating."
1,A WORK OF FICTION,"I should point out that this books was not written by nor in co-operation with Jordie Chandler and is a re-hash of the lies and rumors which were carried by the media at the time of the false allegations made against Michael Jackson. The author is a tabloid journalist of the lowest calibre - a colleague of Diane Dimond who worked alongside him at Hard Copy - who is well know as being anti-Jackson and was involved in fabricating ""evidence"" against him in 1993. Don't waste your money on this book as it is more or less a work of fiction and sets out to discredit and defame Michael Jackson rather than expose the truth - which was that he was the victim of an extortion attempt by the boy's father. To find out what really happened I suggest reading ""Redemption"" by Geraldine Hughes, who worked for the legal team involved at the time and reveals how Jackson was well and truly set up."
1,Unreadable,"So what? Who cares? That was the basic impression I was left with after reading about two thirds of this sophomoric, self-congratulatory ego fest. I could not finish the book. The combination of his cliche-ridden style, his bursts of self-promotion, and his unchecked rants against his ""friend"" Garth was more than I could stomach. Any emotional capital he may have earned (his sister's death, the all-nighters to finish the boat) was just squandered. This would have made a great magazine article, but it makes a terrible book."
3,Italian Grammar in Practice - Purchased through Amazon,The book parallels and adds to the textbook and workbook Italian Espresso. It expands on the grammar in the textbook in a very helpful way. The copy I received had many of the exercises in the first 72 pages written in - which I don't recall being identified in the offering.
3,no discount given,"i was offered a $30 discount if i applied fot an amazon credit card when buying this product.however, it never came up again after i applied and was approved.there was no code given or any place to ask for the discount...or any further mention of it and it was not taken when i paid.what happened to my $30 discount?"
4,Zalman CNPS7700-Cu Cooler for Intel/AMD Motherboards and CPUs (Pure Copper),Fan and heatsink installed fine but the speed control did not work. I did an RMA to the company and they acknowledged they would replace the speed control. Area that is greatest concern is distance from edge of heatsink to the power supply. Most cabinets do not allow enought clearance for this large heatsink especially in the mid size units.I had to look at cabinets and find one that had an unusually wide spacing from the motherboard to the power supply to get the motherboard with the heatsink installed in the cabinet. Recommend you check this closely or you will may need a new cabinet if you want to install this heatsink.
3,Only fun the first couple times,"I bought this for my 6 year old because he loved the water toys at the dentist's office. He played with it the first day for a while, but it got boring fast. It's not very challenging even for him and the balls often get stuck under the frog."
3,It is not just another book,"about Argentine cinema. For the first time you can read a serious treatise. On the second volume, on the other hand, the old thesis about Argentinian foreign policy and the lack of celluloide during the Second World War is carefully pulled down-Highly recommended for all those who want to see beyond the traditional mumbo jambo of well-mannered books.Cynthia Udaondo"
4,It's quite worth,"to have this book at home, provided you are interested in Latin American cinema. I think the authors have scored what they aimed. It's a book for college students. Hope the second volume is as good as this one"
4,"Paper folding, an interesting approach to teaching math",Children will love the hands-on approach offered in this book. Paper folding is a cheap way to give kids a hands-on experience with math. The book is very good for geometry and fractions. It is pertinent to all age levels.
2,1st time reader,"This is the first book I've read by this author. If they changed the main charactor's name to Agatha Prune and made her 12 years old, it might make more sense. I have another book by this author from the library, that I've yet to read. Maybe she'll grow on me."
3,Swizz's Showcase of Superstars,"DMX, Jay-Z and the Lox: some of the hottest names in hip-hop. Drag-On, Infa Red, Parle? Virtual unknowns in the rap game. Eve is hot and on the rise but the star of this cd is the man behind the music: Swizz, the super producer. His dirty beats are laced over dirty tracks and heart pounding hooks. DMX doesn't rap enough on this album and the LOX only make a few scattered appearances. Its good, but don't jump out of your seat to go and get it."
3,I THINK IT WAS WORTH THE MONEY,"I WOULD JUST LIKE TO COMMENT ON THE RUFF RYDER'S COMPILATION I REALL THINK THAT THE C.D. WAS UP TO PAR ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARED TO THE MAJORTY OF C.D.'S COMING OUT NOW. TO HAVE 15 CUTS AND I COULD EASILY LISTEN TO 9 OF THE SONGS I BELIEVE THAT IS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT. DONT YOU. MOST PEOPLE ARE VIBIN OFF OF JIGGA BUT IT'S NOT THE TIGHTEST SONG ON THE ALBUM IT'S JUST THE CATCHIEST PHRASE TO SAY WHICH A LOT OF TIMES SALES A SONG. BUT THE SONG WITH THE BEST LYRICS AND I REALLY DON'T LIKE THEM AS A WHOLE BUT THE LOX'S SONG IS THE STANDOUT I BELIEVE ON THE C.D. FOR SHEAR LYRICS THAT IS. BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO GET PUMPED UP YOU GOTTA BUMP DMX,S SOME X SHIT. THEY COULD HAVE LEFT OFF THE J.D AND MASE CUT AND NO ONE WOULD HAVE MISSED IT. THAT'S MY REVIEW HOPE YOU AGREE AND IF NOT KEWL."
1,licks badddddddd,the worst beats & rhymes all the features of a crappppy record. i made the mistake of buying this junk. if you want a record with perfect beats & rhymes buy yourself Busta flex & the red rat.
2,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE,"Man, this CD isn't even CLOSE to what it's proclaimed to be. I like the artists on the CD but they didn't do their best job. Overall, this CD is not worth the MONEY$$$. Get Death Row's greatest hits or The Chronic 2000:Still Smokin, they're much better.!"
2,RYDE OR DIE - DIE...,"Without DMX and Eve this would be a total disaster.I wonder what was DMX thinking when he joined ""Puff Ryders"".It's a shame to do with The Lox and Ma$e."
4,RR,"This is definately the best RR CD they have made. This CD can take us all back to a time where we were chillin, or driving in our car, bumpin this...in the summer, pumpin gas, trying to flex. I love this...even Juvi ripped it."
2,Not so good for rice milk,"I don't drink soy milk, I'm allergic to soy but I bought this unit to make rice milk. I followed the directions to the letter and the thing bubbled over and scolded the milk. I thought maybe I did something wrong and tried again, and again. I tried three times total and was not able to make rice milk comparable to Rice Dream - which was my goal, nor unscolded milk. If you're after a soy milk maker, this is probably a great unit, but it doesn't do so great if you want rice milk.Kitchen's Best are a good company to buy from, they used to offer a great money back guarantee, not sure if they still do, so if you're after rice milk, maybe you could try it and if it doesn't work well, I think you would have no trouble returning it. It's possible my unit was just a lemon."
1,Boring,"I spotted this book in the library, saw the cover art, and thought, ""Oh boy, an action-packed sci-fi novel about spaceships!"" I had never heard of Modesitt but the quotes on the back cover seemed to lend some credibility to the book.As the chapters went by, I kept trying to convince myself I was engaged in an interesting book, but you know what? It's just plain boring. In a future galaxy of spaceships and planet colonization, the main character seems to spend all his time leisurely strolling around from embassy office to embassy office, mildly contemplating something. Modesitt made a grand effort but the overall effect is soporific and tepid. 500 pages of gentle boredom. Sorry."
5,Best Modesitt Book,Read this one with the Parafaith War - two sides of the same question.How far do you go for what you believe?
2,Average .. !,"The first half of this book was fantastic. It was really heading somewhere but the second half was just a big flunk, total let down. I cant believe the last part of the book was like this. Very disapointed."
5,wonderfull,"I just want to let you know that I loved this series when I have one of V.C. Andrews books I can't put it down until it is finished. I love and own every book V.C. Andrews has writen, people want to borrow them but I don't lend them to anyone. every couple of years I reread a series because I just like reading them. The next is the orphan series Thank you for listening to me. Keep up the good writingTerry Rainville"
5,This is the best story i have read yet!!!,"Just like alot of others every time I got to a real good part I just couldn't put it down,not even for a second. This story will keep anyone who reads it in suspence.Though some parts made me want to cry this book is great!!!!"
3,this book was ok but ...,i thought that this book was going to be told at least HALF by melody . i was very upset to learn that they expected me to drop my intrest in learning about cary and melodys married life at the end of the third book in logan series . i think that the book should have been about melody reading lauras diary . that would have made this book ten times better .
3,Another VC Andrews page turner - yet disappointing,"Learning of Laura and how her tragedy came to be was indeed interesting. I hope this is not the final in the Logan series. There is still much open from Melody's story! What will happen to her! In addition, whatever finally becomes of Haile. Writers...we need to finish this series completely!!"
3,AVATAR THE LAST AIRBENDER,"IT WAS OKAY. BUT IT LOOKED USED, AND LIKE SOMEONE DID SOMETHING TO IT. STILL I WAS SURPRISED THAT THEY MADE ONE IT."
3,Good purchase,"I bought this item twice. This first time, i received the complete wrong order, and Amazon was great in helping me get my money back. Nothing from the seller regarding the mishap and no follow up... in any case, i always lose bobby pins so i decided to go ahead and try to purchase AGAIN. This time, i received the right item. The box is smaller than you would think, about 2"" x 3"". The bobby pins themselves are really nice and the curve helps adhere the pin to your head. They stay really well and have been a great addition to my hair styling products. The one con about this product is that after you used them maybe twice, the little balls that help protect your head from the sharp ends fall off and you end up stabbing yourself with the bobby pin or throwing it out. Kind of a waste in my opinion. Overall though i'm pleased and hopefully i wont be buying bobby pins for a while to come."
4,"Very, very, excellent","I just got this CD today and I've listened to it three times already. It's very good indeed.Originality- 6/10: This CD expands greatly on the industrial genre, and is tried and true.Lyrics- 8/10: This CD contains one of the Columbine killers favorite songs, ""Son of a Gun"", which is a nice song. The lyrics in this CD are on par with intellectual theming as well as typical emotions of the human.Musical Ability- 9/10: Sascha does a very good job and yet expands his talents in this CD. You can hear the musical talents entwined with this CD.Special Guests- 7/10: Ahh, this CD includes encores from the frontman of Revolting Cocks, Chris Connelly, and many beautiful women chorus singers also.Overall Rating- 8/10: This is a must buy CD for any industrial fan or listener to the genre. This will further inspire your Rivetheadom..."
4,"After a few listens, you'll love it.","Bought it and put in it. And i'll admit. It's different and didn't know what to really think. Had already heard a few songs a while back. Downloads and Retro (something else new KMFDM fans should ponder). Standout tracks. Of course it's obvious that the drums on Ikons are the exact same on Jihad off of WWIII. But it's safe to say both are completely different and great. A bit surpized with the fact that En Esch only did one solo. And only one song. No vocals. No backuup. Just a solo. Better than nothing. But at least he did a favorite of my on symbols. Leid und elend. Also a bit disappointed with the absece of Raymond Watts. One, who in my opinion made Nihil what it was. Huge factor, at least.This is a huge departure from everything in the past. Much like a final album with symbols being a new beginning with more electronics and synths. Definately a must have for any person who calls themselves KMFDM fans. Definately one of their best. And harder than the rest."
5,It Truly IS a Miracle!,"Now, I really really like mayonaise--there's almost nothing better--but sometimes I feel like something a liitle more whimsical. At first I used to add corn syrup and lemon juice to regular mayonaise but it really didn't do the trick. Then I discovered Miracle Whip! I couldn't believe it. Since then, I always make sure to keep a bottle on hand. Thank you Kraft Foods, you guys are my hero!"
2,So terrible I couldn't finish,I truly don't understand the possitive reviews. I've seen better animation from high school kids as youtube videos... for free. This movie has some of the worst animation ever. Like whenever several people are walking they just did the animation for one person walking and copy pasted it. The story might have been ok but I'll never know because the art direction was so awful I couldn't force myself to watch it. Not worth the price unless you're just a dragonage completeist.
5,Wonderful for teaching Spanish and English learners....concepts and music.,Good for teaching concepts in Spanish as well as having fun with music. His pronunciation is very clear and singing voice delightful.
5,An Awesome Read For Everyone,"As a writer, public speaker and philanthropist, Leigh practices what he preaches and his ""life lessons"" in WINNING WITH INTEGRITY are the positive lessons many of us can use, learn and live more productive lives with. I know I will."
3,Useful but Style a Bit Sloppy,"I'm just getting into this book, and it definitely is very useful for me, but the artist's work often looks a bit sloppy. I haven't sketched up many things -- I've only had the book a few days -- but sometimes I find myself fine-tuning the piece [i.e., using a paper stump to blend] and I wish he had included areas that show the reader material more broad than just the New England area.That said, I'd certainly recommend the book at a 3-star level -- I am finding it useful -- but sometimes I look at the author's ""finished drawing"" and it doesn't look finished to me at all.If you love New England beaches, lobster boats, and fishing shacks, you'll be really happy with this. I just wanted a broader focus than the book provides."
3,Good but a little hard to relax too,"This Cd is good but for me it was kind of hard to relax to because it kind of has the same tone pattern throughout the cd which made my mind wander. I really want to try one that has speaking on it. I think it would provide a better guide for me. But all in all I use this occasionally when I need to just try to chill, but I like yoga better!hehe :) Hope this was helpful."
3,"It's Not ""Heresy""","I expect bands to evolve, that is what makes music so great. Paradox, however, evolved light years form this album to ""Heresy."" It has a its moments, you can definitely hear where the ripping will commence with a little time to develop, but I can't say I want to listen to it repeatedly. It was hard to top ""heresy"" once I heard it. I think it kind of ruined anything else they did for me, past and present. It's great thrash, though!"
1,don't waste your money,"I seriously doubt that anybody tested these recipes before they wrote this book. A couple of the recipes I really love, but some I have tried repeatedly and they never turn out. Don't bother with any of the bread recipes and most of the cake recipes. Very disappointed. I threw it away and then dug it back out for the couple of recipes I do like."
1,unreliable recipes,"The photos in this book are so seductive that I keep on trying new recipes from it even though they never turn out right. I am not a novice baker, yet I could not produce anything acceptable using this book. The ingredients quantities are often incorrect; the instructions are neither detailed nor precise enough. Some of the recipes call for very delicate and advanced techniques, but in this book they are simplified or ignored completely so it is impossible to achieve success.I do not recommend this book, even though it might be very hard to resist the tempting photography."
3,Heartfelt,Started out very sad. I had to remember this was a Christian fiction and it would not get into gory details.
5,Absolutely Amazing,"I am not a huge book reader, but my friend convinced me of reading ""Redeeming Love."" At first I sighed, thinking about how long it was. However, once I started I couldn't put it down and read it in 3 days. I read it everywhere, every chance I got. I even read it while waiting in the drive-thru.I can't even explain how amazing it is. Michael's unconditional love for Sarah and his faith in God assured me that the right man is out there I just need to pray and I will surely find him. I loved the bible references and how although it was a romance novel, it also showed the love of God.I believe that everyone woman, no matter where they are in their lives and where they are in their relationship with the Lord should read this book. Its an incredible book that you will never put down."
4,Loved the plot,It was easy to identify with the main character. Beautifully written. Good book to read while curled up next to a fire!
5,BEST BOOK EVER!!!,"Although I am a Christian, I'd never read any Christian books until this one. Now that's all I read. This book was recommended by a young man at my church and boy, was I impressed. I've read all my life, I love it, but I'd never read a book that was as great as this one. This is a must for anyone who needs to know what it means to really have a relationship with God & what it needs to be between husbands & wives. Men should read this book also, it'll give them a new perspective on women, marriage and God. I've read 3 or 4 Francine Rivers books now & they are all really, really good, but this one has been the best so far. SERIOUSLY!!! A MUST READ for EVERYONE!!! Thank you Mrs. Rivers for putting the story of Gomer & Hosea into a story everyone could relate to."
5,her best book,"in the theme of Hosea, this is the author's best book. characters are well developed and bibilical theme is carried out."
4,Ok but like her other works better.,"I liked this book but not nearly as Francine's ""Mark of the Lion"" series. I found most of it pretty engaging but there were some parts that I found somewhat repetitive and a bit slow going. I won't need to read this one again and may not even recommend it to the people that I did recommend her other works that I have read to."
5,Redeeming Love has lots of redeeming qualities,Thisi book helped me to move from non-reader to reader. Captivated me from the very beginning. Romance done tastefully. Intriguing Christian stories that touched me on several levels of my Christian walk. We will use this book at the subject of our Christian bible study book of the month. I would recommend it to anyone.
5,An Excellent Book!,This book captured my interest from the first page. I could hardly put it down. A definite must-read!
5,Love this book!,This book is so hard to put down. This is the second time I have read it and enjoyed it just as much the second time. It is a beautiful description of God's redeeming love!
5,Life changing,Best book I have ever read. Absolutely life changing. I will be buying it as a gift for all the women I love.
5,Not only women read this book.,"After the first 2 chapters i was hooked. It's a powerful book. So amazing I couldn't put it down. I would get mad, i would get sad i would even weep. Its amazing. I recommend it to a lot of people who i feel will enjoy it. Great book though!"
1,Redeeming Love,"Our church book club selected this book based on the reviews from Amazon. This is the first time I have felt let down by Amazon. The way our book club works, we give a book a rating on a scale of 1-10 before we discuss the book. The book received mostly a 3 with one member refusing to finish the book.This is basically an OK romance novel. It became quite preachy and predictable-except the end which was over the top. Would not recommend it anyone."
2,Redeeming Love,"Just my opinion, but not one of her better works. Very redundant as if to take up space. Not very enjoyable. However, her other Christian Novels are fantastic."
5,My First Christian Romance,"The only Christian books that I ever read were non-fiction ""how to"" books. I got tired of trying to fix myself so now I just let God do that. I have read fiction with faith interjected throughout the story before but this is my first real Christian fiction let alone a Christian romance novel. It was my first kindle ebook as well and I hated to put it down. Rivers took me through an array of emotions and reminders of God's love for me. Reading this book also came in a timely manner. God was preparing my heart and mind to receive less than happy news from a friend. My first reaction was to judge her like Paul judged Angel but through this book God gave me the understanding to extend grace, love and compassion to her. I want to be that unconditional love to my friend as Michael was to Angel. The revelation of faith, obedience, love, commitment, sacrifice and grace that I received through reading this story will stay with me forever."
5,Good read,This historical fiction piece was a page turner. I enjoyed the book which is loosely based on a biblical figure.
4,Redeeming Love,The quality of the book itself was terrific! The story line became a little tedious-too long in coming to a conclusion. Perhaps it is because I don't have the kind of love expressed again and again in this book! Over all it was a great story!
4,Redeeming Love: Francine Rivers,I enjoy Francine's books on Old Tesatament prophets - this one was excellent. Just wish I could find her copy of 'The Prophet' which I would dearly love to read!
5,"Awesome, Must Read Story",This is the second time that I have read this book now. First as a library book and now on my kindle. Both times it was fantastic. I think Francine Rivers does an incredible job developing her characters and creating a story line that has you hanging on every word. I had a hard time putting this book down both times that I read it. (Even though I knew what was going to happen the second time!) I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a true love story. Enjoy!
5,An instant favorite!,I enjoyed this book so much! Read the whole thing in 3 days! I could not put it down. Such a beautiful story! Truly a must read!
4,Christian adult romance,"This is a Christian romance with lots of preaching and teaching of God and his love. This is also a very tough book with lots of emotion and hard subjects. These books are for adults with adult situations but are kept clean, like a pg13 level. I liked Angel she was a good character. The way they came to be married was a little far fetched and there was a little more drama then was necessary. But overall I liked it and it was a good read."
1,child porn,"This book is a disgusting example of child rape that leads to a life of prostitution that the women cannot get out of. Don't read it on a full stomach, b/c it will make you vomit."
5,Very inspirational!,This love story is very well written and vivid. This is a good reminder of how God's forgiving and persistent love can change our lives.
5,"Wonderful book, Awesome gift. :o )","I enjoyed this book so much that I actually felt guilty, keeping it all for myself. This would be a wonderful book to not only buy, but to buy as gifts."
5,A breathtaking look at the redemption of God's love! Tied in with a romance theme,"I started reading and couldn't put it down!! I, being married , found it to be romantic. Not in the typical ""romance"" way! (An, I am all in, forever, no use in running, we are meant to be together cause God says so, kind of way.) It will take you on an emotional rollercoaster and I just wanted to shake Angel , as did Michael in the book. But toward the end it all comes together and it all made sense why she kept running. We can all love something or someone that it (or they) become our idols, instead of putting our all and giving our all to God! Very eye opening on what a marriage should be to. Always loving, slow to anger, and always forgiving! GREAT READ"
2,Love story disguised with redemption,"This was nothing more than a poor rendition of a love story that focuses on sex but has God speaking to the main characters. Can you imagine Hosea as super man? This is so formulaic that it was difficult to read; you knew early on the outcome. No surprises; everyone lives happily ever after. Psychologically, there are some flaws in this but she did get it right on some level and that is ""Angel"" needed to be set free. I only read it because of a friend who wanted us to read it for book club, but all of us are laughing and worrying how to tell her how bad it was. Please, there is better literature out there that has God interspersed in it. If you want redemption, then read the Christian Bible and you will understand how to be redeemed!"
5,Thank you Lord!,God alone led me to this book. This book has touched my heart in places that I never knew existed. I found myself falling in love with my Lord and Saviour. Well written and a great read! God and His love is threaded throughout this book. I am recommending this to every woman in my life!
5,loved it!,"A friend gave this book to me and I put off reading it because I thought it sounded boring. Once I started reading it, actually within the first 4-5 pages, I was already hooked on it, and it just got better from there. I thought that it would be sappy and mushy, but it definately is NOT, and Angel, is NO angel, and I found that I really liked her for that. I would love to find more books by this author that I would like just as well!"
4,Great Novel!,I really enjoyed this book! It was very well written. The book kept me engaged from the beginning to the end. Some scenes kept me mesmerized and under the spell--just a few scenes felt unrealistic and out of place for me. I was maybe expecting more from the reviews. But I would recommend this book to everyone.
5,This is my favorite book!,"I have recommended this book to everyone I know. Everyone who reads it cannot put it down. Francine Rivers transports you into a place where the people are real, and the struggles they experience reflect reality, rather than a cushy ""Christian-land."""
5,Reedeming Love,"This book is amazing! It actually seems to come alive as your reading it, almost as if your watching a movie unfold! The first time I finished reading it, I actually went online and bought one for all of my friends and family and they were ALL touched by it as well!"
3,"Enjoyable, But Predictable","I enjoyed this book, but it was quite predictable (especially if you know your Bible stories). The characters were well drawn, but it all was a bit melodramatic for me. It bogged down a bit in the middle to end, but was an incredibly fast read up until then. I enjoyed the journey to God and redemption that is played out in the novel and would recommend the book for that reason."
3,dvi freezeup,i also discovered this problem after picking up an hdmi upconvert dvd player. audio feeds fine but video will freeze at random. also discovered that the tv doesn't recognize the upconverted signal. play a dvd an go into menu. shows 480p at 60hz. that blows when hdmi-dvi cable is $100. very disappointed with this!
1,Hokey and pitiful plot disguised by lyrical descriptions,"Love it or hate it...I guess. What was the point to this story? Three women in varying states of coherent thought hold a priest hostage, abuse him and then when, convieniently, one of the women happens to be able to solve the issue at hand, they let him go? The plot was lame and obvious, the use of myth and story interesting at first and then it got really old, the mixing of pagan and religious story quite compelling but then rather overdone. I've never seen anything masquerade as a literary gem the way this seems to be. Send this book off to a remote island, please!"
3,just about ok,"This is a basic light tent. There are no instructions, but it is fairly easy to pop it open. Folding it completely back is another story. I just keep it folded flat, so I can move it to storage. Description still says 4, but there are only 2 backdrops - one white and one black. The drops are folded and the creases are sharp and appear in pictures, even if you used wide apertures to blur the background. I am not sure how the other reviewers ironed this (comments on this would be much appreciated) - I tried quite a bit, but they won't go because you can only apply so much heat before running the risk of burning a hole through them.The material of the tent seems to be decent, but the product is definitely over-priced."
5,great product - no so great service,"I put in an order for this and it took 3 whole days for UPS to pick it up from seller. So, this pushed the delivery date from the initial estimate. It finally came, BUT WITHOUT the backdrops (white and black cloths) that are IN the picture, but not listed under ""Technical Details"". Something smells fishy."
1,Serious heath warning on wood burning pen!!!,"I did not know that a wood burning pen has some chemical in it or can be created from it that can cause cancer, birth defects or fertility problems. I feel that this kind of information should be explained more, like what is the chemical that causes it. Does it come from the plastic around the pen or is it caused by fumes from the pen and wood. the warning on the pen is confusing and alarming. I wont let my child or anyone else use the pen, but the wooden bird house can still be put together and painted on."
4,Great late night listen,"I listened to all of the N.O.W albums and bought this one and Carboot Soul. I really like both but I would say that I marginally prefer Carboot Soul.The music is mainly instrumental with varied low key drum/beats- it is a nice relaxed late night listen if you want something that has some soul and rhythm to it and yet is fairly laid back. There are no stand out tracks .... but the album is good overall and just hangs together nicely. I am not a ""smoker"" but if you were then this might be a fitting background music as suggested by it's not very subtle album title.I have some ""pure"" ambient music that I also listen to at night ..... the N.O.W albums are a nice and slightly more upbeat alternative to that."
3,Electronica Enya!,"I liked Enya. When she came along, I was entranced; then, a more sophisticated realization of the world of 'world music' opened up to me and I bid her adieu. The same goes for this disc. Maybe in 1995 it was cool, laid-back listening; now, though, it's just all right...somewhat corny here and there and overall not very engaging for the ear. If your collection is slim, this will be a great disc, but as your collection grows and becomes more discerning, you will leave this one behind."
5,Cool out with the MB's,I heard these cats way back in '97 and i heard the track Galaxies in '98 and i was hoping praying that they would put out an album or 2 in the future..then came Self vol 1. instantly love at first listen..CHOPS is a dope beatminer..and he produces a great ablum..fresh beats for all to enjoy..this is true under ground hip-hop..too bad more people dont know about these guys..BUt i do see a number of reviews besides mine and that good..if you love hip-hop then you'll love this joint..they can flow and they gots stlye..Kudos to ya'll MB's keep it up..bonis...
2,undeveloped and overrated,"I heard this CD after it was recommended to me as being original and funny. The only thing funny was the weak-a** rhymes: ""I was raised by Amazon women on the moon/ now I live in a balloon/ sometimes swim in a lagoon."" True underground heads should pick up everything by groups like hiero, the coup, and black star, not these over-hyped imposters. Oh, and any producers out there... jack the tight beat from ""fluids"" and put it to better use. peace."
2,Disappointed,"Was hoping this fruit fly trap was a cheaper alternative to the much more expensive trap sold by Gardener's Supply Company. Cheaper is all I got...requires you to add water. Yes, the trap worked for a couple (3) weeks, but the trap itself started smell'n funky, so in the trash it went. Stink is not a problem with the more expensive ""dry"" type, lasts for 1 month, but mine worked for 2 months or more."
3,"Cute idea, maybe too fragile...?","I got this as a gift for my nephews and they loved it!When an adult tried to assemble it, however, a small piece snapped off and made it impossible to use."
3,The BAD Hand Buzzer,This buzzer does not shock at all. You wind it up and it vibrates. I bought 4 of them and none of them worked.
3,"Nostalgia, but not very good","I used to have one of these about 30 years ago as a child, so wanted to get one for my 6 year-old son, but it doesn't work very well, as the buzz lasts for less than a second, and doesn't vibrate much at all. I am surprised that no one has invented an improved one that is battery operated, and maybe includes a small motor. Anyway, it is a nice bit of nostalgia for very little money. Cheers."
2,Only got 1 and it was the wrong one,I ordered 2 only got 1 but that is ok they were very cheap. The wrong thing was sent anyway. it was supposed to be female to male; but it was Male to Female. Oh well I just kept and went on. This was to much of a hassle for an item that cost was less than a dollar. I would waste that much in gas and phone.
4,Great problem solving,I received the wrong item and notified the sender. They corrected the error very quickly and were very apologetic. I will shop with them again. Thanks for all of your help.
3,They Should stick to one type of sound.,"Randolph's Grin, I originally hear them on a Compilation album featuring various Industrial bands. The Album was called Awake the Machines Volume II or maybe I, anyways this album starts out like a very gothic Industrial sound which is very good if your into to that. I am and was compairing the sound to early 80's punk rock group called 45 Grave (which was of course a goth-punk band). I personally felt their talent lied in this area of sound cause the rest of the album then because slightly more industrial sound towards a washed out version of either Skinny Puppy or Ministry. Their industrial sound was not very good, it's to bad they didn't stick to the sound produced in the first two songs. Other then the first two songs I'd say there was 3 songs that were OK the rest was very experimental sounding Industrial at time but nothing to write home about. I'd recommend sticking with real industrial bands then this one."
5,Always Good,Zao is one of the best real band out right now and if you like there old stuff you will love this because it has a old school hardcore bets and I love it.Zao is a band that will keep you on your toes with each song the timing on each song is perfact you could not ask for then a better band.
4,Great Phone for Geeky Guys with a shallow pocket. The only bad thing is the size,"I bought the phone right after I got my annual bonus in the beginning of 2006. $160, a refurbished phone, sounds really expensive. However, the rich functions really told me that it is a super bargain. The $10 per month unlimited internet / email from Sprintpcs is just perfect. The avantgo also make my long journeys between NYC and DC a very enjoyable reading time. I bought a 512MB memory card for the phone and it stores various applications and data: mp3 songs, microsoft digi maps, Gameboy simulators...The size of the phone is the only shortcoming, which makes the phone impossible to carry with a big pocket in the jachet.Overall, it is the most impressive cell phone I have ever used. Compared to my dream phone, the 6700, it only lacks the wifi and added some 30% in size. Everything else, just perfect..... but $300 less......"
3,some good - some bad,"It is very big....awkwardly big at times and handily big at others. The thing that I really didn't like was my earrings hit the touch screen when I was talking on the phone and pushed the buttons...irritating. I don't like the fact you can't send text messages either. I really couldn't utilize the email feature because I have msn mail and so I couldn't use it. I did try to send email using my sprint PCS account and it wouldn't go through, it said it was sent but it was never received. I guess if you are a business person with business email and the need for all the great features, it would be a gem. For me it was just a pain. I traded it for a flip phone."
1,The Brain That Wouldn't Die,This movie is in the top 20 of worst movies ever made. It's so bad that free isn't a good enough price for this movie. Minus one star. Your time would better spent sleeping. Count Wolfenstein
2,Unhappy with this coffeemaker,"We bought this coffeemaker to replace our Mr. Coffee machine and we thought we were buying an ""upgrade"". This machine was more expensive, and made by Cuisinart, but we were disappointed when we received it. We thought we would give it a shot since it was expensive; however, we were still unhappy with it. We couldn't easily tell how much water we had added and if the coffee pot was not 100% in the correct position, it clogged the filter and ended up getting coffee and coffee grinds everywhere. This was not a one time occurrence, this happened several times. We finally gave up and repurchased another Mr. Coffee."
5,"love it, works perfect",Got it a month ago. So far has been working very well. User friendly. Like the ease of use of dial knob. Great Coffee!!
4,very good dependable coffeemaker,This coffeemaker is the second Cuisinart I have owned. The frist one was a refurbished one and worked great for several years and is the reason I purchased this one. They are very dependable and make very good coffee.
2,cold coffee,"this coffee maker just can't make the coffee hot. This is my second one, thinking the first one was broken. The machine produces luke warm coffee - YUCK!"
5,Great Java Maker,"Prompt delivery. Excellent condition. All as described. Works great. Easy to program and the coffee is brewed perfectly. Have several Cuisinart products and all them are far above average. You may pay a bit more, but you will get a quality product. I strongly, without reservations, recommend this product."
4,"It's a coffemaker - little more, nothing less","The coffeemaker works as it is advertised. The high temperature setting on the heater to keep the pot warm keeps it reasonably hot, but on the edge of not being hot enough. Overall easy to use."
5,Coffee Maker,We really like this coffee maker. The filters would constantly collapse in our old coffee maker and you had a pot full of coffee grounds when you were finished. The pot always spilled coffee no matter how carefully you poured out the coffee in the old pot. This pot has solved those problems. It keeps the coffee much hotter on the warming surface even on the low positions. We just love this coffee pot. Will always buy this brand.
4,Good coffee--quickly,I had already decided on what kind of coffee maker I was looking for and did a search to see where I could get the best deal. That was Amazon [...]The Cuisinart coffee maker arrived in good time and works like a champ. I especially appreciate the internal water filter and how quickly it makes a really good cup of coffee. Well done Amazon!
5,good hot coffee,"High brewing temperature up around 190 degrees. Plus the adjustable warming plate allows you to keep the coffee hot after it's brewed. My brother-in-law is a coffee snob, and he was impressed."
5,Just as Advertised,"I appreciated the 12 cup capacity. Seems larger than the Krup's coffee pot this replaced. Easy to clean. Great coffee. But what everyone raves about is how HOT the coffee is. Instructions tell you to stir the coffee and I do,it does make a difference."
1,Caught Fire,"After having had this coffeemaker for about a year and been reasonably happy with it, we were recently forced to replace it. I heard a sound from the kitchen one morning, thought perhaps it was rain on the skylight, or that my wife had put up eggs to boil. When I investigated, I found the coffee in the carafe boiling and smoke pouring from the unit. I unplugged it and removed the carafe. Dark smoke continued to stream from the machine for another thirty seconds or so, filling the house with it's acrid odor.I shudder to think what might have happened if I had not been home at the time. It seems to me that the electrical parts used in the construction of this coffee maker must not have been designed to safe enough tolerances and the quality control in the factory is insufficient.I would not risk buying another cuisinart coffee maker. I see that they are owned by Conair, the same people who make the cheap hair dryers."
3,Doesn't last,"I bought my Cuisinart DCC 1200 coffeemaker in January of 2008. It had worked just fine until last week, when it started to turn itself off before finishing brewing. No warning, no sound. I was unpleasantly surprised to find a pot of cold coffee waiting for me when I came back to the kitchen to check on the coffee. After talking with Cuisinart customer service, and cleaning the unit as they suggested, the same problem continued. Customer service and I agreed that the thermostat was probably shot, and since the maker was out of warranty, there was nothing more to do. Perhaps 4 years is about as much as one should expect for the lifetime of a coffeemaker, but I'm not convinced of that."
2,Worked great... for a while,"It's a nice looking coffe maker, with good, simple features. However, my product died in 4-mths... Didn't bother returning it, and went back to the trusty Mr. Coffee."
1,Coffee Pot lasted 8 Months!,"I purchased this coffee pot in August. By the following April it had quit brewing. I called the company several times reporting that my pot was shot and I needed to have it replaced. They told me for an entire week their system was down and I couldn't file a request for a return merchandise order. Finally one full week after I began calling I met with success! However, they told me I had to pay to have a replacement shipped to me and I also had to pay to ship my defective coffee pot back to Cuisinart. This is the very last Cuisinart product I will buy. I'm sure it was a fluke that it died in 8 months, however, a company that charges you to replace a defective item isn't a company I wish to deal with. This is a very loosely constructed limited three year warranty to be sure - order it if you wish, but, be prepared if it dies on you! The company is very difficult to deal with."
1,What a MESS!,"I love my Cuisinart Food Processor, so I thought the new Cuisinart DCC-1200 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker would be worth the $100.00 price tag. I was so wrong. When reading the directions, it did say that if your grind is too fine that basket overflow MAY occur. Since I usually do a medium grind on beans, I thought it would be fine. NOT! I end up have to clean the biggest messes. Now my grinder is set on the largest grind to try & resolve the problem. Don't even think about using Melita's fine grind. It will over flow on a regular grind from a can! You're safest only making 6 cups of coffee at a time in the 12 cup carafe. That way when the filter becomes clogged with grinds you don't get crunchy coffee."
3,Cuisinart Refurbished Coffeemaker,"If you're looking to save a few bucks by purchasing refurbished, take heed! We loved our coffeemaker. It made the best coffee we've ever home brewed. But after only 10 months it gave up the ghost. Just refused to brew. The little light would come on, and it would just sit there looking sad.I am afraid to buy another of this brand because the price is not worth it for only a few months of use."
4,quality coffee maker,"Looks good, works well, easy to use and clean. I wasn't sure about ordering this item on-line after looking at several other coffee makers in stores as some brands in this price range felt or looked cheap (loose knobs, parts that seemed flimsy, etc.)"
2,Condensastion on resevior lid drips on counter every time.,"Every day when you lift lid to add water or remove coffee grounds from day before and add new coffee grounds , condensation on lid will always drip on your counter, about a 1/8 cup of water BEHINE coffee maker.You will have to wipe it up every time you make your coffee. It makes good coffee and looks nice, but it will always drip water on your counter from condensation.It drips behine the machine.So always have a rag handy to wipe the water up when you make coffee,or you can just leave the water on your clean counter every day."
5,A Chef From Cincinnati,"After using a number of different automatic coffeemakers at home, I was losing hope of finding one that would produce a great cup of coffee. Not only did I not have to spend a fortune, I found one that looks great, produces great coffee, and has the special features I prefer(automatic brewing, makes 12 cups, operates quickly, yet produces a great tasting cup of coffee). I have recommended this coffeemaker to many of my friends . . . and recommend it to you."
1,Fire Danger,Coffee maker worked for a little more than two (2) years when it suddenly and unexpectedly started burning up. A pungent electrical burning smell continued to come from the unit even after it was unplugged from the electric outlet. The Consumer Product Safety Commission should issue a warning to consumers about the potential for a fire to occur even when the unit is being used correctly.
3,Great looks - weak design.,"I bought this coffeemaker after using two inexpensive Kenmore coffeemakers for the last eight years. I thought this would be much better than the others even at double the price - WRONG!Pros:*Coffee tastes great.*Cool looking - sleek.*Coffee is HOT.Cons:*Water tank is narrow and difficult to fill - I frequently miss and pour water all over the counter.*You must measure the water in the pot before filling the tank - the tank has a very lame water level indicator.*When the coffee is done brewing - an annoying series of beeps (5) indicates when it's ready to drink - it's loud at 5 A.M.!This coffeemaker looks great in the kitchen, but it's not the best design - the water tank BLOWS!"
2,Cuisinart coffee makler,It fills up with water when you don't want it to and holds coffee in the fill up contpration unnecessarily
3,The carafe breaks easily!!,"This does make good coffee, but the carafe is made of extremely fragile glass and breaks very easily. It can break just from setting it in the coffee maker or setting it on the counter, and it does not take an unusual amount of force to do so. i've talked to several friends who all have this machine and they have ALL had to buy several replacement carafes. I'm looking now for a stainless steel carafe for this.........."
3,Cuisinart DCC coffee maker,Makes good coffee. The water container is not as easy to use as in other coffee makers...narrow opening and measuring marks are on the inside and difficult to see.
4,Some like it hot ...,"If you like your coffee hot ... this would be a good buy. If you like a very quiet coffee maker ... this would not be the one for you, however, I have gotten used to the noise, and don't even think about it anymore."
3,"Ray, Willows","Coffeemaker was listed/advertised as having a brushed stainless finish. Delivered item is called ""brushed metal"" which looks like a painted surface finish. Very disappointed, nowhere near the finish/color of our other appliances. But, I'm suffering from coffee with-drawals, so I guess we'll keep it."
3,I've bought my last Cuisinart.,"This is my 3rd Cuisinart coffee maker, and shall be my last. This one lasted about 18 months before shutting down. None have lasted more than 2 years, which I find ridiculous. I am extra irritated because I just recently purchased new internal filters. The coffee it produces was just above average. I bought it on good reviews from here and other websites. I wonder how many of the glowing reports were written early in the Cuisinart's life, and how many of these are still functioning today."
1,Ours Failed Too - Less Than a Year,"We bought this last year as a 'new job' gift to ourselves to take advantage of the great deal AND the brew timer. It just stopped working one day. And that was it. I am not at all inclined to call customer service because I do not want a new one. It works great when it works. Then one day, it doesn't. It's a great deal, but cross this model off your list."
2,Too short-lived,"My husband purchased this pot for me last Christmas. I wasn't crazy about the design...small hole for pouring the water in...etc. So since I still had a working pot, I didn't use it until my old pot died. I thought the coffee it made was no better or worse than any other pot. I have now used it what...6-8 months...no where near a year since this is only Nov. 5. Yesterday it made coffee automatically, but failed to keep it hot and this morning it is totally dead. The light is on, but it does nothing. My old pots Mr. Coffee, Black & Decker, etc, whatever I have had, all lasted longer than this! This is too short of a life for such an expensive pot!"
1,Great coffee maker when it was working,Have had this model for less than 3 years and it has given up the ghost. Bought this coffee maker because of its standing on the consumer search website. It does make good coffee but to have died in less than 3 years is not very impressive. Not worth shipping to be fixed at a cost of at least $20. Will put that money toward buying a different and cheaper brand. Why spend between $80 and $120 on something that doesn't last? They sure don't make'em like they used to.(Update) Cuisinart sent us a replacement model and that model died in less than a year. Cuisinart does not make these coffeemakers to last. My advice would be to stay away from this model and Cuisinart in general.
3,Good coffee maker...could be better.,"I bought this coffee maker as a gift for my mother and father. They are both home throughout the day, and enjoy coffee throughout the day. I thought this would be great for them, as you can turn the temperature down to keep coffee warm, without scorching. It brews fine, but SHUTS ITSELF OFF after 4 hours. Auto shut-off was not a feature mentioned anywhere, even in the user's guide. We have also found the gold filter frustrating, as there are often fine grounds in the brew. Water fill reservoir is also a bit awkward to use...toward the back adn rather small for my elderly mother to negotiate well without spilling. We have tried to remedy this by putting the coffee maker on a glass tray so she can slide it out toward the edge of the counter to fill it. The tray also catches any ""mess"". A fair product, but not exactly what we had hoped for."
3,"Really good, if it lasted","I am not going to give a lengthy review as those have already been noted. This is a decent coffee machine that has worked well for us. The only problem is that is lasted about a year before the pump and heater died. Called Cuisinart and they gave me some troubleshooting steps to perform. They told me to fill it up with a 50/50 water/Vinegar solution. This was curious to me as I just told the the pump did not work and I would end up having to drain the solution manually (which I had to do). The told me it was still under a ""limited"" warrant which means I had to pay for shipping the unit back. They sent a replacement I shipped the broken one back, no fuss from them. Overall decent machine and I hope this second one lasts more than a year."
2,Stopped Brewing!,"Loved the coffee maker until it stopped brewing. Have cleaned regularly. Less than a year old. First it turned off early, next morning light wouldn't go on, thinking it was the electrical outlet, moved it, light went on but just sat there doing nothing. Tested outlet, it was fine but the coffee maker is not. I loved the 12 cup (which isn't really 12 cups unless you use expresso cups!)"
1,FIRE HAZARD!!!,Potentially deadly. The coffee maker burner became so hot it started smoking after the brew cycle stopped. The machine no longer works and the problem is documented but no recalls have been issued. I hope this helps save a life.
3,frustrating,"This coffeemaker makes great coffee. Unfortunately when it was less than two years old the ""on"" switch began to fail. The only way to get the maker to go on and stay on was to use the ""auto on"" setting and set the timer for a minute later than the current time. (We also had the option of sending the maker to Cuisinart for repair, which would have left us without a coffeemaker until the problem was resolved - not convienient.) Now at two-plus years this strategy is no longer working. The coffemaker just turns off at will leaving us with tepid coffee."
4,The brewer that starts our day,"This is the third Model 1200 brewer we've owned. No, it doesn't just quit, we use it continually. At some point we should probably find an industrial brewer to take its place. Good sides: accurate timer, i.e., the coffee's ready when I'm ready for it in the morning. The heating element doesn't overheat the water to ""burn"" the grounds. The grounds container uses either the gold mesh filter or the #4 cone filters and will hold the full measurement of grounds required for a decent cup of coffee.Negatives: This is the third unit in four years, however, different things have gone out with it, nothing consistent. Your job: be sure to clean it monthly, including replacing the filter. Every 2-3 months (before the warning light comes on) run it through its deep-cleaning/decalcification process. Enjoy your brew!"
1,The coffee maker that died...,"After 8 months, this piece of junk just died. I called Cuisinart and was told that I'd have to pay $10, plus return the broken coffee maker at my own expense, THEN wait 7-10 business days for a replacement!"
1,Whoever sells this item cannot ship on time,"I paid handsomely for this item to be delivered in 2-3 days. The shipper chose FedEx to ship it and they couldn't get it out on time even though it was going from Louisville KY to Indianapolis, IN-a four hour drive. Buy from a different seller."
5,Great Coffee Maker,This coffee maker is very reliable and works better than any coffee maker we've used. We purchased it based on it's high ratings in consumer reports and are very pleased with what we have.
1,Worst coffeemaker ever.,"Congratulations, this product sucks enough for me to break my Amazon review writing cherry. Makes weak coffee. Overflows a lot. Works slowly when it does. The only good thing I can say about it is that the carafe doesn't leak all over the place when you try to pour it."
5,"1 month, no problems","I purchased this coffee maker about 1 month ago, and have had zero problems with it. The controls are very intuitive, the design is very sturdy, and the coffee tastes great. I don't know if it's the electronics controlling the water temperature or the in-line charcoal filter, but this Cuisinart has continually produced high quality coffee even with lower-quality ground coffee. My background includes 5 or 6 years using basic Mr. Coffee 4-cup and 12-cup models. The Cuisinart is definitely a preferable machine if you can afford the price tag.My only complaint is the water tank measuring system, which is recessed within the tank, with no external viewing window. This can make it difficult to verify the water level in dimly lit conditions or for shorter individuals."
2,Not for 1-4 cup (1 Real Cup) Batches,"I'm usually the only one who drinks coffee so I choose this coffee maker primarily due to the 1-4 cup setting hoping that it would make a nice robust small batch of coffee.I must say that I'm very disappointed. When making a 4 ""coffee maker"" cup batch, the coffee maker fails to extract much flavor from the grinds. Instead you end up with a cup of hot water that vaguely tastes like coffee.I find that if a make a batch of 6 ""coffee maker"" sized cups or more, then it performs much better and I get a cup of decent tasting coffee.At $80, it should perform as advertised. I'd return it if I could."
2,Great while it worked; died after 2 years,"I really loved this coffeemaker while it worked - it made lovely pots of hot coffee and was relatively easy to clean. There was no problem in changing out the filter or any other maintenance. One day last week - without any warning - our coffeemaker decided it would not turn on again. Regardless of the many outlets we used, the coffeemaker will no longer power on. It hasn't even made it past the 3 year warranty deadline and customer service is also being a pain. It grieves me to say so - but I won't be purchasing this item again."
3,"Good for 3 years, but now...","This coffee maker leaks from the bottom of the unit. The machine worked pretty well for 3 years but recently developed a slow leak from the bottom of the unit...it still puts about 90 to 95 percent of the water in the pot as finished coffee, but I have to lift up the unit and wipe up a good sized puddle of fresh warm water from the counter top as well as wipe down the bottom of the maker. Kind of worried that it is leaking and it is electrical, seeing as water and electricity are a deadly combo. I did some research and it appears leaking from the bottom is being experienced by some other owners as well. One guy (an engineer) took his apart and found and aluminum water heating tube that developed a hole because it was clamped down too tight...not sure if I have the same problem, but I'm not going to take it apart to find out.In the recycle bin it goes, now I can tell my wife what to get me for X-mas this year."
1,"Water in, Water out.",I was unable to use the coffee maker because of a defect in the tank. The water came out the bottom almost as fast as I poured it in.
4,Good coffeemaker,"I like the looks and size of this coffeemaker, and the 1-4 cup function. I didn't find any difference in the temperature of the coffee when adjusting the warmer plate to high. I still need to nuke a cup to get it piping hot."
3,Clogged up within 6 months,"I had this coffee makers only 6 or 7 months and it totally clogged up. I tried running coffee maker cleaners and vinegar through it, with no luck. I have tried several times to contact Cuisinart by email, just asking what I could try, but they never returned my email. I'm pretty unhappy , considering the money I spent."
3,"Cool Machine, Cool Coffee","Someone else posted about cold coffee. I love this machine, but the coffee is tepid after I add my 1/2&1/2 which was not the case with my last, old, Krups coffeemaker. I like the Cuisinart so much though that I'll exchange it for a new one and see if that will do the trick because everything else on it is great. The flavor of my coffee is excellent, but it's hard to savor when it's at gulping temperature. I will update this post after I try another machine."
3,FOUR MONTHS OLD !,"GOT THIS IN BLACK/STAINLESS STEEL FOR MY NEW KITCHEN, IN JUNE. IT DOES NOT BREW ANYMORE. E-MAILED CUSINART'S CUSTOMER CARE, A FEWS DAYS AGO, THEY HAVE NOT RESPONDED YET. I LIKE IT, BUT NOT SURE IF I SHOULD ORDER ANOTHER. APPARENTLY, THERE IS SOME KIND OF ELECTRONICS PROBLEM. READ THAT IT WAS ADDRESSED, BUT I DON'T WANT ONE THAT DOES NOT HAVE THE FIX"
3,"Good coffee, but...","Hi...Purchased one of these about 3 weeks ago...just came back from looking for a new machine.The coffee is decent, actually good, but it's a pain to use...and even the quality of the java doesn't overcome that...as it's very difficult to fill the water tank and it does back up from time to time.Not sure what else is out there, but I'm looking for something that is both easy to use and makes a decent cup of joe!"
5,Very solid product,Wonderfully tasting coffee. Very easy to use. Nice features included as well as a very sleek look for a black or stainless kitchen!!!
1,Caution.,"I had this coffee maker for about 5 years and last week after I brewed my coffee, the hot plate got so hot that it was smoking and melting the plastic. Think goodness I was there to unplug it and run it outside before it burned my house down. I dont recommend this coffee maker it can start you house on fire!"
4,Good...not GREAT...but good....,"Bought the stainless steel+black version, mainly on the advice of Consumer Reports which rated this pot top. Looks great with our other stainless appliances. I would have to agree with other reviewers that the water-pouring area is a bit small - especially if you are bleary-eyed in the morning. The water-pouring area is only about an inch wide and maybe a couple inches long. Compared to my old Mr. Coffee, which was about 6 inches by 4 inches, at least. One feature that does not seem to be mentioned often is the ""auto clean"" feature, where the coffee maker must have some sensor that determines when the calcification buildup gets too thick. I have not had occasion to see it work yet, but it is a cool feature. I also like the ""gold tone filter"" - makes for filter conservation (not GOLD, just GOLD TONE - what is that all about?). All that said - this machine makes a decent cup of coffee."
5,A Good Pot Makes a Difference,"I have always purchased a $25 coffeemaker. They were fine. This coffeepot makes great coffee. Small space to put the water in. No shaky hands will make it. Spout pours cleanly so that helps a lot. I like the coffee my new coffeemaker makes, and I hope to get many good years of use out of it."
1,"Great coffee maker, poor lifespan","I purchased this coffee maker about 18 months ago based on all of the good reviews. I was happy with the coffee maker, it has a self cleaning option and it looks good too. It does not seem to make the coffee scalding hot if that is how you like it. The worst thing about it is it just died on me after 18 months. The heater element seems to have burned out, the coffee maker light comes on but it does not process the water. I smelled an electrical burning smell when it stopped working. Hopefully I just had a bad unit and this is not indicative of the product."
2,Broke,"Liked it until it quit after several months. Was returned. Maybe it needs to have the vinigar run through it once a week or so, but that seems like a bit much."
5,"For a coffee snob, perfect!","I am a self-proclaimed coffee snob. After having some cheaper coffeemakers, I chose this one. I have had it for about 3 years now and still love it! Being a cone filter brewer, it provides the best water to coffee path short of a press. One of my favorite features is the adjustable temperature for the hot plate. The hotter the plate, the faster the burnt taste occurs. I would highly recommend this coffeemaker!"
5,"Works perfectly, excellent coffee.",I suggest to those of you who enjoy coffee on a daily basis and are using a 20-40$ coffeemaker to buy this product. Taste will improve with whatever grade of coffee you use. Quality appears to be very good.
4,Pretty good coffee machine,"I have been using this machine for about a month now, and reckon it's pretty good.It's easy to use and makes a good cup.The lid to the reservior could use a little tweak in its design, as it drips condensation on the counter when you open it. You also need to be careful filling the reservoir, as there isn't a very large opening to aim for.I do like the features, being able to set how long the burner stays warm and how hot the burner gets is nice. The clock and auto start features are both easy to use.Let's hope that it has longer life than the last two coffee machines I bought."
1,Disappointment,"Barely lasted six months of weekend use before it died--water and coffee backed up through the machine, and after that, we could not get the machine to work at all. Who wants to mess with boxing up a coffee maker, taking time away from work to go to the post office, and paying to ship it back to the manufacturer? Next coffee maker will not be a Cuisinart."
4,Finally- consistant HOT coffee,"I have several tried several coffee makers. I couldn'd find one that made consistant hot coffee or one that didn't leak down the carafe when I poured it! I finally found a GOOD coffee maker, and one that will keep warm for up to 4 hours! (usually they all shut off after 2 hours, which didn't work for us, especially on weekends)This one is great, and I love the fact that it gives a low tone beeping when it is done brewing and when it is going to shut off.It's not too loud, but enough so I can hear it and I don't have to keep checking to see when it has completed its cycle! Thanks Cuisinart fro combining all the best features of a coffee maker into one fantastic product!"
5,Best coffee pot ever made,"I will probably never own a better, more reliable coffee pot in my life. I've owned all kinds of different brands, and this one is simply the best. I bought mine in 2004, and it is still working like the day I first plugged it in. When the price was cut in half in 2010, I bought one as a gift. I'm half tempted to buy another one in case the one I have ever wears out. Great value at this price."
2,"Worked Great for 1 Year, then Dangerous!","Bought this coffee maker after seeing over 2000 reviews, most of them positive. It worked great for a year. This morning, we noticed the coffee in the carafe was BOILING! Started to smell an electrical fire-type of smoke, so we turned it off.I have no regrets owning this for the first year. Brewed coffee great! But be prepared that this is not a model that will last for years."
3,Leaky mess!,"I bought the Cusinart DCC-120 because of great reviews, but my experience has been less than positive. It makes good coffee,but not piping hot. It leaks water as you're trying to put the water in the holding tank and the tank is inconvenient to fill especially if you are in a wheelchair and can't see in the top. The coffee carafe is a nice except for the lid which snaps on and off and if it isn't placed just right doesn't stay on. I wish I had never bought this machine and bought the electric Bodum Santos, even with the fact that the pot wears out in a year or two, it is a much better maker for anyone with handicaps! And the COFFEE IS GOOD & HOT!"
1,Makes good coffee but not reliable,I've had this coffeemaker for about a year and it completely stopped working. It did make good coffee when working though.
2,Looks nice but it leaks and has short life span,"I'm on my 2nd one. I liked the first one so well that when it finally wore out I bought another. The quality level is definitely different with this more recent buy (about 6 months ago). Both units leaked from the reservoir. That hasn't changed. But unlike my first one, this one died after just 6 months. The heating element (that boils the water) just stopped working all of a sudden. The red light is on so there is power to it, but nothing happens. Very bummed. For this reason, I don't have a lot of loyalty any more to this brand. The quality is definitely not as good as in years past. I'm going with a different brand for my replacement. Maybe Krups this time."
1,Cuisinart DCC-1200 coffeemaker,"In the past 5 years I have purchased 5 of these coffee makers (3 for my daughters and 2 for myself.(not from Amazon). As soon as the warranty date expires, something goes wrong: on/off switch doesn't work anymore.....coffee isn't hot enough when through brewing.... Only 1 was replaced because it was still under warranty. When it's working it makes good coffee! Cost more to have it repaired so I would purchase a new one. Never again!"
1,This coffee maker is a dud!,I purchased this coffee maker almost a year ago based on the strong reviews on Amazon. i was replacing a cheap old coffee maker and thought that by spending some extra money that I would get a better quality product. I was wrong. While the coffee maker works fine it is the so noisy while brewing that it wakes my children up in the morning! Do not buy this product of you want a quiet appliance!
4,Cuisinart DCC-1200 Brew Central,"This is the first coffee pot with an excellent pour spout that doesn't drip when pouring into your cup. A design feature that could be improved is the water fill level mark. A water fill level should be visible from outside. My wife, being short, has a difficult time too see water level mark inside of the water chamber."
4,Great for the price,I've always used the cheap Coffee Mate brewers in the past so this easily exceeded my expectations. The timer function and the setting for 1-4 cups are both useful. The issue with not being able to see the water level in the back isn't really a problem because the carafe has the measurements on it so you can measure water in there and then pour it into the back.
1,Never again,"I Just threw out my third one. We loved the styling, but basically they are not quality, more JUNK from CHINA. I have better things to do, besides buying new coffee brewer every 18-24 months. I have had other problems with Cuisinart products before (over priced crock-pot), which fries anything you put in it, so much for slow cooking. I am very brand loyal consumer, but I am done with this brand."
4,2nd purchase,"This is the second purchase of the very same pot for this household. Like many coffee pots the heating elements just gives up the ghost sooner or later. Although that is disappointing enough we still came back to this pot for its convenience, familiarity, and, for the number of cups it can make, its relatively small footprint. Also, the purchase price was excellent - $30 to $40 less than local big box retailers. If the heating element lasted longer than 3 years I might have thought about the 5th star."
4,Solid Performer,We have owned some version of this coffe maker for about 8 years. It is a reliable performer that consistently makes a great cup of coffee.I have broken the glass pot a few times and they are fairly expensive to replace so I have purchased a new coffee maker.The only complaint my wife has is that the coffee does not get hot enough but she likes her coffee really hot!
4,A step up from Mr. Coffee,"I bought this coffee pot a few weeks ago to replace an old Mr. Coffee machine that died on me. This machine is much sturdier and seems to just perform better than the last coffee maker. I like the temperature option for the pot. It keeps the coffee nice and hot. I also enjoy how I can pull the pot out in the middle of the brew cycle and the coffee doesn't drip all over the hot plate. This was a problem with my last coffee pot that just drove me nuts.The only down side I see with this machine is that the reservoir is hard to get to and to see how much water I'm pouring in. I've made a couple pots that were more than I intended because I couldn't see how much water I was putting in. Other than that, I do enjoy this coffee pot and look forward to using it for a long time to come."
2,It left dry coffee in the the filter!,"I based my purchase of this coffee maker on Consumer Reports' top rating. I had decent luck using the handy 1-4 cup setting for small batches. After a weak 12-cup batch, I decided to double the amount of ground coffee per cup, as per the coffee manufacturer's suggestion. I didn't use the 1-4 cup option since I was actually making six cups. The coffee again turned out weak. I was about to toss the grounds when I discovered that about 20-30% of them were untouched by water during the brewing process. No wonder it turned out weak. If results don't improve in the next few pots, this thing is going back to the store."
1,Didn't last a year!!,I received it in April and now it is Nov. and it leaks. I will buy my next coffeemaker in a store so I will be able to return or exchange item.
4,Makes great tasting coffee,I recently purchased the same coffee pot at Costco for 49.99!!! Extremely well made. I'm sure it will last a long time.
4,Cuisinart Coffee Maker,"This product is fuctionally excellent and is constructed well.I would consider purchasing a cuisinart product either this oneor a similar product again. There is one major problem, however,this product had an Amazon rebate attached for $10. I submittedthe rebate as instructed on the rebate form. I have not heardanything about my rebate. I have contacted Amazon customer serviceby telephone and email and I have not received any satisfactoryanswer to my request. It seems that my request have been completelyignored. When will Amazon decide to give the proper customer serviceon this rebate? If I have a choice, I will never purchase such a productfrom Amazon.com."
2,Great while it lasted,"What can I say? Lots of features and makes great coffee. But it was 3 years and done. Not really what you'd call built to last. I would recommend just buying a a cheap Mr. Coffee programmable maker at about 1/3 the price. Then even if it kicks the bucket after 3 years, you are still way ahead.Mr. Coffee DRX5 4-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Black"
4,Happy With It,I really like this coffeemaker. It makes great coffee. The only problem is trying to see the water level. You have to measure the water before you pour.
4,"Makes good coffee, like the features, not the controls so much","This model makes very good coffee and has the features I wanted: beeps when finished brewing, auto shut off and programmable start time. I don't like the internal cup measure, so I just watch how much I fill the carafe.I have a very similar, two-year old Cuisinart model that sprang a leak. I preferred the controls on that model; the markings are easier to read. Also, it uses a rotating/push know rather than the DCC-1200's cheap-looking toggle switch sticking out of the front. And it has a window showing how much water I have poured in the tank. (I have figured out how to fix the leak's cause -- a split hose on the bottom -- and I will put that one back in service). Cheers!"
1,Worthless,We could never get the coffee maker to work without getting water all over the cabinet.Don't waste your money get a Mr. Coffee
2,Undependable,"My first Cuisinart Brew Central lasted about six months and died. It would only make steam. I replaced it under warranty at a total cost to me of $20. The coffee maker sent under warranty is not covered for the full 3 year warranty, only for the remainder of the first coffeemaker's.My replacement(second) coffeemaker lasted about one and a half years and this morning finally died. It has been shutting off midbrew for a few months.I am shopping for a new coffeemaker, not another Cuisinart."
2,"looks good, but does not last",I am now on my second unit. They look good and make good WHEN they work. The first one lasted almost a year and then would not self clean and quit brewing. Got run around from service people on phone. NO HELP! Liked the taste of the coffee so I got another one.. SAME OLD STORY! went out in about 10 months. Service no help.Should have learned my lesson the first time. There will be no third time.
2,doesn't pass the test of time,Bought this unit about a year ago. Like others i was impressed with name and looks..... I didn't give creedance to the reviews i read here and elsewhere. One day i woke up to fix myself and wife a cup of hot coffee and nothing...lights come on but no hot coffee.
4,New Cuisinart DCC-1200,I recently purchased this Coffee Maker to replace another major name brand German coffee maker system that I had been using for the last 10 years. I have been pleased with the performance so far. I find the coffee is brewed well and the machine is quiet in comparison to my previous machine. The quality of the components are excellent and I like the retro style and brushed stainless steel look. The printing on the face of the machine is small; however all I need is the simple switch and the on-off light anyway.
3,"Made GREAT coffee, but only for less than 8 months.","Was VERY happy with this coffee maker for 8 months, it made consistent good coffee. It it is easy to use and appeared well constructed, the controls were easy to decipher and use.HOWEVER after only 8 months it went DEAD as Ceaser's ghost. Both the water heater AND the hotplate. Sad, I really liked it it has minimal counter foot print and did make really good coffee, and quickly."
5,Wonderful coffeemaker,Very happy with this coffeemaker. Easy to use. I didn't find it a problem to pour the water into the pot - the opening is adequate. Brews great-tasting coffee. I love the matte black finish - very sharp-looking. Very glad we chose this model.
5,Best Coffee Maker Ever,This Cuisinart DCC-1200 Coffeemaker is the best I have ever had. I am 77 years and its taken this long to find the perfect Brew Machine. The coffee stays hot just the way I like it. Thanks Amazon.
2,Quality Has Gone Downhill!,"We've had 3 of these coffeemakers. The first one lasted 5-6 years. The second one lasted 1 year. The third lasted 7 months. The coffee tastes great, the styling is nice. But the longevity is terrible. For $70, I should get at least a few years out of it. Cuisinart, you're harming your good name with an appliance like this!"
5,HOT HOT COFFEE,"Best coffee maker we have ever had. We have literally tried everything from really cheap ones to really expensive ones. We have had this one for over a year now. It is simple. The buttons are intuitive and utilitarian. There is no question what they are for or how to operate them. Although modern in its own way, the simplicity harkens the simplicity of the 1950s. It has a timer and clock and other fancy options. But, best of all, there is a big metal (yes, metal) switch dead-center for ""on"" and ""off"". So, if you just want to make a pot of coffee and turn it on, there you go. The other major thing about this coffee maker is that it makes very hot coffee and it stays hot. Several people have remarked about this. This is not a you'll-get-burned hot, but almost. Perfect really."
2,Caught fire!,This coffeemaker was doing great until this morning when it caught fire. We bought it a year ago in 10 days.
3,"Good coffee maker, reliability issues","I bought this just over a year ago, and has always made a great pot of coffee...until this morning.I woke up to popping/clicking noises coming from the burner - I'd thought maybe coffee or water had poured onto the burner, but the plate was dry and the 10 cups of water I'd put in the night before was fully accounted for in the carafe.On top of the noise, what I first thought was steam coming from the unit turned out to be smoke, and I could smell burning plastic.I've probably had five or six coffee makers over the last 20 years, and have never had one do this. I don't know how common issues like this are for your average coffee maker, but if you search around on this model, you'll find a surprising amount of complaints like mine. Cuisinart was very cooperative in honoring their warranty, at least.tldr; Makes great coffee. Doesn't immediately burst into flames when heating plate shorts out."
4,Good Product--Could Be Better!,"Received in good shape via UPS several business days in advance of Amazon's ""Estimated Delivery Date""--a pleasant surprise. Main negative for me is that the clock on front panel is somewhat hard to read (small, not lighted)--serves the purpose well enough for machine set-up times for brewing, hot plate length of warming, etc.--but don't count on it as a handy kitchen timepiece that you can read from a distance. Agree with most other reviewers that the internal water reservoir and its scale could be improved--have to stand right over the machine to fill and read the water level. Other than these small negatives, however, generally well pleased with this product."
4,Very good coffee; a few shortcomings,"Very good and hot coffee. I'm very particular about coffee and not so easy to please when it comes to a cup of Joe. Only two shortcomings--the clock area is very small, and not brightly lit so it is hard to read the time. Also a nice feature, which this is missing, is a water gauge on the outside of the coffeemaker. With this unit, you have to peer in over the top of the machine to look at an internal gauge to check the water level. But still would definitely recommend it and plan to keep it. Plus it was top rated in a recent Consumer Reports article. And the Amazon price was very good."
3,Makes good coffee but disppointed in design flaws,"I read rave reviews about what great tasting coffee this pot can brew, and I was not disappointed, but the design flaws are so annoying that I have developed a grudge against this coffee maker to the point that we are not on very friendly terms. I just don't understand how such simple things could have been overlooked in designing this coffee maker.Pro'sBrew quality1-4 cup brew optiontemperature control for burnergold mesh filter includedCon'sWater level gauge is worthless. One should not have to stand on a step stool with a flashlight to read the water level gauge! Water is extremely well camouflaged inside the very dark reservoir, you sort of have to give it a shake to see it.Clock display is also well camouflaged - gray on gray with only faint illumination making it nearly unreadable."
1,Agree with 04.25.2012 entry by Wii Fit Mii,"Until this morning I would have written a good review. However, this morning it started hissing, popping, and smoking. Unplugged in a hurry and opened the windows to vent the house before the smoke alarms went off!! I got an enjoyable year and a half...now it's back to the drawing boards. Agree with Wii Fit Mii...keep your fire insurance up to date..."
3,"Coffee is good, but it died within a year","I bought this a year ago and now it wont work anymore :( The coffee was great, but it just stopped working!!"
2,Never again!!,"My DCC 1200 lasted less than 6 months before it started dripping water all over the counter/floor and I pitched it. Decided it was a fluke and bought another Cuisinart...DCC 1100 this time, and after just TWO months encountered the same problem!! I decided to remove the bottom of the coffee maker this time to see just what was causing the problem and found a hairline crack in the hose leading from the heating element to the basket water feed. BAD HOSES, and this seems a common problem if you read the reviews (leaking) for all the Cuisinart models.I had no problems with the coffee taste or function of the machine, but a leak after just a couple of months on two separate machines is not a lark! I don't mind paying for a good coffee maker, but I expect it to last at least a year! No more Cuisinarts for me..."
2,Doesn't make the coffee hot enough,"First of all, this is a very nice-looking coffee maker with a restaurant-quality appearance and has really useful features, like the programmability and the variable auto-off, good coffee flavor, and the little beep that lets you know you can start pouring your first cup is really cool. However, I'm taking this unit back to the store tomorrow for a refund because, as another reviewer has stated here, this coffee maker does not make the coffee quite hot enough. At first I noticed the 3-way warming switch was factory-set on ""medium"", so I thought no problem, I'll just switch it to ""hot"" setting and that'll take care of the less-than-restaurant-temperature hot. No, I couldn't tell much difference. So, then I tried using the 1-4 cup button that is supposed to make the water twice as hot- still not hot as it should be, if any hotter at all. So, I decided that for a hundred bucks, I'm not happy with this discrepancy and back to the store it'll go."
5,Cuisinart 12 cup,Love my new Cuisinart 12 cup - great design - filter system is easy to change - coffee has a good bold taste.Would buy another one
3,"Pretty, but not husband-friendly","Admittedly, I got this coffee maker because it is pretty. It does make great coffee, too! I would like to keep it, but my husband isn't very careful when putting the carafe in, which causes a malfunction in the release thing-y and leads to water back-up and coffee grounds everywhere. He's making me return it! I'm thinking of going for the Keurig."
3,Looking beyond the facade...,"Like many other reviews of this Cuisinart coffee maker, I will agree that it is good on looks, and most importantly, brews a really good pot of coffee. But beyond those aspects lie some fundamental design flaws. The charcoal filtering helps, but only a certain extent, depending on your tap source. After a brew cycle, there is quite a collection of condensation on the water reservoir lid, so if you do not shroud the back of the machine with a towel of some sort when lifting the lid, you will be drying the entire back and underneath of the machine, not to mention your countertop. Last, but certainly not least is the toggle on/off switch. I got about a years' use of the DCC-1200 before the toggle switch contacts decided to go kaput. Once that happens, you are left with a very good looking coffee maker that can no longer make coffee. Contacting Cuisinart got me no further than the explanation that there is no part replacement for the toggle switch. Buyer beware..."
2,Watch out for smoke.,"Looks very nice and worked perfectly for almost 5 months. Yesterday it was used and it started to smoke and it burned out, clearly there's something wrong going on with the manufacturing of the product since it appears this is not the first time this product has produced this specific problem. I would pick something else!"
2,Only good for a year,"Brews a good cuppa, but not a quality product. Woke up, flipped switch, light came on, but nothing got hot. I expected better."
4,Excellent Coffee Every Time,"Lots of nice features and settings. Looks attractive and blends in with my stainless steel appliances. Sometimes it is a little hard to see the cup quantity markings in the fill reservoir when you are making a small pot, however, the markings on the caraf are accurate. When programming, the digital numbers are a little difficult to read but otherwise a very good coffee maker."
4,"Quick brewing, Fair price","We originally got this coffee maker as a wedding gift and functioned flawlessly for 2 years, then the on/off switch just stopped working. We purchased a cheaper Mr. Coffee alternative to fill the gap and noticed a difference immediately.The Cuisinart brews 5 cups in what seems like less than 5 minutes, temperature is good and the charcoal/water filters make a big difference in flavor. The replacement Mr. Coffee machine took forever to brew, almost 15 minutes for 2 mugs full of coffee that didn't taste as good.My wife and I found the black chrome Cuisinart on sale at Amazon and purchased it immediately. Very happy again, not too expensive, but well worth the price.4 stars because it didn't last more than 2 years last time."
2,Great coffee - poor machine - poor customer service,"My machine lasted exactly 2.5 years & Cuisinart will not stand behind their warranty. They will send me a new machine but not until I ship back the old one along with a $10 check (so I can plan on around $30 to get a new machine that will probably crap out again in 2-3 years, based on other reviews). Additionally, the new machine will not have a warranty on it. My old Braun coffee maker lasted 10+ years and cost 1/2 of what this machine did. As long as you don't mind replacing the unit every 2-3 years, it makes great coffee. I do not recommend this brand."
2,Disappointed,"I have owned a Cuisinart Coffeemaker (other style) before and thought this would be a nice change (look, style, etc). From the first brew it has not worked efficiently... the water 'spray' gets coffee grounds all over the inside, the temp. of the coffee is not as hot when first brewed as my other model, the decanter has to be extremely carefully placed on the plate or the coffee does not flow into it well. It is simply disappointing and I would like to return it if possible for my ""old"" model. Sorry, Cuisinart!"
4,Cuisinart 1200 makes a good cup of coffee.,"Purchased this unit about a month ago and have been quite happy with it. It has a small charcoal filter in it and a 1 to 4 cup setting that heats the water more for a complete brew. I found by using my Brita pitcher filter that it helps take out the ""city"" water taste and results in a good cup of coffee. It appears to be well made and has functional controls."
4,Does what it says,I've used Cuisinart appliances before. This is basic coffee maker with a timer and shut off. It uses a triangle kind of mesh cone. I like the kind with a flatter bottom so it can stand. It makes good coffee fairly quickly and hot. I am not into those little pre measured single cup deals that seem so popular. I like to make a pot and have it hot for a couple of hours.It's a hundred bucks and in my opinion that is about twenty too high
2,Too loud for too long,"Makes coffee fine and I want the grinder-in-one coffee maker feature, but can't it make a grinder that does'nt wake the entire neighborhood. It's not only really loud, but keeps going and going .... can't Cuisinart make a vresion that takes care of this?"
2,disappointed,"Purchased 9/14/2010. Best coffee maker I had ever owned. BUT 2/21/2012 .... made coffee as usual. Waited for final beep and coffee maker started steaming and had a terrible odor, like plastic melting. I unplugged it and waited for it to cool down. Coffee tasted strange. Tried to make more coffee and nothing happened. I went out and purchased a Cuisinart DCC1100. Could not afford the 1200 at store prices. Hope this one lasts longer. Don't remember if I registered 1200 coffeemaker but I will register this one on line."
3,Let me know what you think in a year or so...,"We loved our coffee maker...atleast until we had it a year or so. What was once a terrific coffee maker now makes bitter coffee no matter what we do. We've replaced the charcoal filter twice, cleaned the maker several times, switched coffees, etc. and nothing worked. Still tasted bitter.Now, to add to all that, the automatic timer no longer works. We set it for the correct time, etc. but it shuts itself off.My advice: look around before deciding on this one. It's also not made very well, despite it's looks."
1,Quit working after 14 months,"I should have followed the advice of the one star reviewers. Shame on me. We purchased this coffee maker in February of 2010. Loved it while it worked, but this morning, fourteen months later, it died. Yesterday I noticed the coffee was not as hot, this morning it won't even run the water through. My cheap coffee makers lasted longer than this. I'll never buy Cuisinart again. Good luck if this ends up being your choice."
5,Great coffee maker,"I really like this coffee maker. Makes great coffee, is attractive and easy to clean. Love it! I like that it has different temperature settings and a filter for the water. I like that there are numbers in the water reservoir that tell you how many cups you've put in it. I have never used the auto-on/timer feature. I assume it must work well too, but I don't know for sure. No regrets! I recommend this coffee maker and would buy again!"
1,Design flaw,"This is a beautiful coffee pot and the brew was terrific. No complaints there. My problem was with the design and layout of the clock. When the coffee was brewing, excessive steam would rise and completely disable the clock. The steam would get inside the mechanism which could only shorten the life of the timer I so desperately needed. It would take an hour to regain visibility and after a week, I returned it as defective. The second pot did exactly the same thing and I decided there must be better out there. I can't recommend this great looking coffee pot, even though it made a really good cup of coffee."
4,Brews good coffee,The features of this coffee maker make it more versitile than most others in its price range. It does take a little doing to get it set up but it brews a good cup of coffee.
4,Good coffee maker at an excellent price.,We selected this model based on Consumers Reports and it is a very good product at a reasonable price. The only downside we've found is that it is slightly difficult to pour the water into.
3,Poor Design,I bought this coffeemaker after carefully researching and reading the reviews. It's disappointing however....The water reservoir is tiny and in the back - I spilled several times when trying to fill it for the initial cleaning. The knobs are not intuitive and the whole machine gets quite warm when brewing coffee. I'm sending it back.
4,Nice coffee maker,"This is a nice coffee maker. The only issue I have with it is not so much that you can't see how much water is in the machine, but rather that the area where you pour it is on the small side. So water sometimes gets spilled. Other than that, looks nice, quiet, accurate (put 4 cups of water in, got 4 cups of coffee out). Unless you need really scorching hot coffee, the temperature is good. My coffee has had varying tastes to it, but that is more a result of using left over coffee beans that I've had for a while. I would definitely recommend this machine."
4,Have had for 2 years and only 1 problem,"I've had this coffee maker for 2 years now and for the most part, love it!I especially love that i can set it for a smaller amount of coffee, and has a timer on it so i don't have to do anything in the morning!The only thing is that i would keep the lid open so that it could dry out after making coffee. It seems that this has done something to the lid and for a while wouldn't shut all the way. So for the past month or two i've just been putting a bowl on top of it to weigh it down. Now it seems to shut properly with out the bowl though. Not a huge problem but it's not perfect either."
3,"Nice, until it stops working","I have now had two of these machines, each for about a year, and then they just stop working. They are great while they last, but I think a one year lifespan is too short for the price. Also, i'd prefer a window to show the water level; looking into a black reservoir to see how much water you're pouring is not ideal."
2,Loved it for a year,"We bought this coffee maker a year ago and really liked it. I loved the setting for making 1-4 cups, which it was only set at. We don't drink coffee every day, so I am very disappointed that it broke after such minimal use. I've had coffee pots from the dollar store last longer. I won't pay this much again!"
1,melting lid on Cuisinart coffee maker,"melting lid on Cuisinart coffee makerI've owned Cuisinart brew central 12-cup programmable coffee maker about 6 months. The lid is melting and I'm struggling to open the top.Cuisinart DCC-1200 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker, Black and Stainless SteelModel DCC-1200.[..]"
5,Best Coffee Maker. Made My Wife So Happy!,"This coffee make was a replacement for a Mr. Coffee. It is so easy to use. No mess. Keeps the coffee at the right temperature. And, It comes with a re-usable coffee filter that works as well as a paper one."
4,awkward cup measuring location,"This is an excellent coffeemaker, makes wonderful coffee, is easy to use, and is almost a perfect daily device. It's only ""handicap"" is that the location of the measuring device is inside the tiny ""well"" on the back corner where water is poured into the coffeemaker. One must literally look down into the well to detect the water level. With the coffeemaker on the kitchen counter, my wife is not tall enough to look down the pouring well. All things considered, I would not purchase this coffeemaker again, but instead get a Cuisinart (or whatever) that permits one to see the water level from the sides."
5,Great cuppa coffee,"Second day for my new coffee maker--this replaced my Bunn (of which I had 3 and thought would never own anything else) WOW I am converted---the only disappoint I had was filling the water reservoir--The first time i had water everywhere--This morning I used an inexpensive plastic funnel and VOILA no splash and not inconvenient step to add. I had priced this coffeemaker at Kohls--$99.99--while there, another potential customer, who got online to Amazon and saw that we could save practically $40.00 purchasing here---Went to Amazon and got the coffeemaker and 2 years of water filters for $97.00--plus free shipping!!Another great saving is I use much less coffee due to the filter design--I have no need to have water filter pitcher as this machine has it's own filter---Cuisinart DCC-1200 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker, Black and Brushed Metal"
2,Looks nice but not worth cost,"A real pain to operate, will flood if coffee basket is not precisely seated, basket handle broke off in less than 2 months. Old cheap Mr. Coffee worked better."
5,Our first one lasted 12 years!,"We love Cuisinart products and this coffee pot is no exception. In fact, the one we are replacing still *works*, but the coffee is tasting rather bitter (no matter what coffee/brand we use). We clean it and replace the charcoal filters regularly. The back of the pot (not the glass carafe, the actual machine) feels quite warm to the touch as well. Just think it's old and tired;)The new one is functioning equally as well as our old one so far. Love the auto on/off. We use it every single day. Weekends included. Goes off faithfully at 6:00 a.m. My only complaint about this machine, is the color. We chose black chrome. Our old one was brushed metal (I don't think it was chrome). The black chrome is super sharp, however, being so shiny (shinier than it appears in the photo), it really shows finger prints. It seems that I am constantly wiping it down due to that reason. Other than that...we love our Cuisinart Brew Central."
5,Exceeds expectations,We are very pleased with our new coffee maker. You cannot beat the price and could spend a lot more for a lot less.
5,perfect cup of coffee,I bught this coffee maker for 67.99 on a different site but it is the best coffee maker ever. I also went back and got one for my daughter. I have never tasted coffee like it I thought all makers were the same boy ws I wrong. The filters really make a difference. I would however recommend shopping around.You can get it retail at Mervyns or May Co. for 99.00 so you really aren't saving any money buying it with amazon. I have really been doing some shopping lately and amazon prices are so far off the mark I am wondering why everyone is still buying from them. It isn't just one or two items it has been 20 different items that I have shopped since Christmas.Please get out and go shopping.
5,"Bought in 2004. In 2012, 8 years later, still works like a charm!","This coffeemaker is phenomenal! A solid, solid, appliance. I bought it during my first year of law school in 2004 and have brewed gallons upon gallons upon gallons of coffee in it since then. Now, 8-years later, it still works like a charm and I've had no problems with it. Wish I could say the same for its matching coffee grinder, but I cannot. I only wish that this model came with that amazing, stainless steel, thermal carafe that accompanies some of the other Cuisinart models. Now, that carafe keeps coffee hot forever. Wouldn't recommend using the stainless steel carafe with this model, though, since this model has a hot plate base that might burn the other carafe."
1,Loved it--don't trust it,Loved the coffee maker UNTIL two years and four months later it started an electrical fire. Now I don't trust buying another.
3,Good coffee maker but overflows if I want 12 cups,"What I like: makes great coffee, start timer, auto offWhat I don't like: limited to 15 TBS of coffee grounds or it will overflow, so if you like strong coffee you cannot brew more than 10 cups; the coffee maker the water level is not visible from outside the water reservoir and it is difficult to see how much water you have poured when you only want to make 4-5 cups.I like the coffeemaker otherwise and am resigned to making 10 or less cups at a time. I have marked water levels on a water pitcher so I don't have to look inside the reservoir to measure my water."
1,Broke in less than 3 months,"Very disappointed. I have only had the this coffee maker three months and the on/off switch has broke. Now, to get it fixed I have to pay shipping costs back to Cuisinart just to get a replacement. Not what I would expect from a reputed higher end item. Not to mention that my wife, a big coffee drinker liked her old reliable coffee maker and I talked her into upgrading to this nicer one. Things are not happy here this morning. After the fact I'm sorry that I just didn't go to a local merchant and let them deal with replacements, etc, if necessary."
1,Not worth the money!,I bought this same modle in white a year ago. It have been okay to make coffee but the clean up is horrible it will always look dirty! you can clean the water tank andd it get loaded with coffee grounds.I would not buy this again!
1,Dangerous,"I bought this only a year and a half ago and it has worked fine- until this morning. While it was brewing I smelled plastic burning, went into the kitchen and saw that the machine was smoking from the bottom. I unplugged it and put it on the porch. Needless to say, it goes in the trash. I'm thankful it didn't start a fire. It had a shamefully short life esp. considering the expense. NOT recommended."
2,Stopped working after 1 year,"I was happy enough with the coffee maker, then one morning nothing.I bought another one one Amazon and noticed it had only been 1 year.I am used to the machine and like the 12 cup carafe, this way I have as second carafe around.Still,the heating element should last more than one year."
1,Junk,"I received my Cuisinart DCC-1200 as a gift for Christmas, 2009. It died today, the day after Christmas, 2011.This morning the On/Off button does nothing. This unit lasted exactly two years of weekend only use - so about 200 pots.I will not be buying another of these."
1,Originally loved it ... until it caught fire.,"DEFECTIVE!I bought my coffemaker six months ago on Amazon. I was pleased with it until today when it started smoking and burning.I'm glad I was home at the time, otherwise I might have come home to a burning pile of rubble and a dead dog."
2,"Good coffeemaker, but continually shuts off","It looks good and has many features that make it a a five star unit. We failed to identify the shutoff problem until it was out of the warranty period. Would buy again, but closely monitor performance. Flushing with white wine is a marginal solution. Miss our Toshiba grind and brew coffee maker."
1,Not a very nice cup of coffee or experence!,"First, I have had good luck with this model in the past. I purchased another because of this and was looking forward to the same results. However, this coffee maker has scraped my kitchen counter, spilled coffee and water everywhere and has become a real hassle; And the place where you pour in water into is too small. If the filter holder it's pushed down completely, coffee grounds go everywhere inside the machine and out. I have had better luck with a Black and Decker ($20), then the more expensive coffee makers that are claiming they do so much better. I will not be buying another one anytime soon in the future until they fix some issues. At the moment, it is a high maintenance machine you get to wake up to frist thing in the morning."
2,Bad Packing,Poster was packed in such a way that it arrived wrinkled and folded. It should have been wrapped around a tube to protect it. (Dissatisfied)
4,(Early Assessment),"First of all, let me say that the four-star rating is only a ""holding place"" rating; I need more time to evaluate the album to give its true rating. So far, though, I like what I hear. There is quite a variety of styles here, from smooth r&b with female singing along with the raps, to raps backed by rock sounds (but not hard enough to be considered rapcore), to ""typical"" hiphop backdrops, to the unusual and very fun ""Revenge Of The Nerds."" This is one of my favorite tracks on the CD--perfect to get a party going. There is also a track here directed to Eminem--""Dear Slim."" KJ52 says people have compared him to Eminem, and at first, he didn't like that, but eventually he realized the good side of it--people who liked Eminem would discover his album and like it too...and of course KJ52's lyrics are far preferable to the filth Eminem spews out.Certainly a hiphop album worth checking out. For me, the whole album is worth ""Revenge of the Nerds"" alone."
5,Great for Creative People,"I have a few of these magnetic poetry kits and I love them all! They're great for putting on your fridge, unless you have a tendency to slam it in which case I would recommend using some other magnetic surface. This poetry kit is excellent for anyone who likes poetry."
2,Picnic Tote,"This was my first Amazon order and the item shipped in Green instead of Red that I ordered. My invoice said Red, the packing slip said Red, but the wrong color shipped. And when I took it to a 4th of July picnic it leaked through the outside of the tote. Very disappointing!"
5,Happy kayaker,"Great book. Really gives a sense of the Baja experience and makes it easy to plan a vacation. Although some info goes out of date much, such as what type of fish to expect off of which island, stays spot on."
4,Anyone interested in Baja needs this book,"This is a book that any true Baja enthusiast will spend hours reading. I can't go ten minutes without dying laughing at some of his stories (all of them 100% fact with no embelishment I'm sure! LOL). Peterson has to be a Baja legend - how did he have time to do it all? While I agree that it is invaluable for anyone planning a trip and I consider it to be one of the top 5 books on Baja, I do disagree with many other reviews that say it is a neccessity for taking along on a trip. I consider it much more of a pre-planning book or a fun read. It doesn't have enough current data to be a real guidebook in my opinion. That's not a criticism - just pointing out that it is not a true guidebook. For that I recommend the AAA Baja book - without a doubt the best!"
4,Excellent item.,"This noise suppressor allows you to run a loop of effects through a send receive setup. It performs a function of closing off final output when signal from the send receive loop drops below a certain level.I used this item, a compressor, and modifications to my bass to drastically reduce extra noise and hum in my rig.< Output Unit < Input< Send < ReceiveOutput to your amp.Send to your effects loop input.Input from your instrument.Receive from your effects loop output.Example;< To Amp < From guitar.< To Receive < Compressor < Wah Pedal < Fuzz < Equalizer < SendSend me a comment if you have a question about this unit."
2,no what i expected,they did not list the artist in there ad and when i saw secret ambitions i thought it would be michel w smith singing his sing. it was not and that was the only song i wanted on the cd so i was disappointed.
3,small but does the job,when they say small they mean small. I am short/smaller then average. It fits my hand but could see it being to small for most.
5,A Dynamic Recording,"Paula Robison's voice shines through once again on the reissue of Rio Days Rio Nights. The album is honest, joyful, and full of humanity. Listening to it, one gets the sense that she has lived in Brazil and played this music her entire life. Together with her three fabulous band members (Romero Lubambo on guitar, Cyro Baptista on percussion, and Sergio Brandao on bass and cavaquinho), Robison has created an album that is at once exciting, melancholy, and sensual. It is simply a dynamic recording that is impossible get enough of."
3,"That wacky,wacky,Williams!!",This is an excellant collection of Robert Willians art. However there are a few problems with the lay out of the book.The first 47 or so pages are black and white reproductions which I found kind of pointless and it also took the edge off of the art work.The last 32 pages or so are the color versions of the art work. All in all it is a good collection of Mr. Williams art work.
1,Way too complex. Need a skilled mechanic to install.,"The website just did not give enough information and made this look like you just plug it into the lighter socket and that was all. As soon as I got it and saw all the wires I knew I would have to return it. Just showed it to my mechanic and he said it would take about 6 hours and cost 10 times what I paid for just the device. May work well when installed, but I did not even get that far and sent it back."
1,Wouldn't know - never arrived,"The product may be great but the company is itself has terrible service. I placed an order for this product but didn't receive a confirmation from them for over a week. Then, two weeks later, my credit card was charged and notice sent that the product was being shipped the next day. THEN, a week after that, I got a notice that the product was on ""indefinite backorder"" and my money would be refunded. Needless to say I will never order from this company again."
4,A glimpse into the historical challanges of South Africa,"I like to read novels from other countries and I picked this up solely because the author was from South Africa. I was not disappointed. The story moves back and forth in time, touching on the Boer War, World War Two and contemporary South Africa. In doing so, the novel deals with war, racism, greed, and ultimately shows how we are all inescapably tied to the past, both our own past and that of our family, community and country. For Americans, many of the historical references will be only vaguely familiar but are so very important in that part of the world. There is also an element of magical realism in the novel, with characters that transcend all time periods, and some sort of angel-man who seems to guard and haunt the inhabitants of the town simultaneously. Overall, I liked the novel quite a bit and would recommend it."
5,Modern Medical Thriller,"Neiderman has hit a nerve here with Deficiency. He's cleverly exploited the health craze in America and developed a fast moving suspensful thriller that's a level above most because of the way he depicts the villain. I love the way he gets into this evil mind and more importantly shows how vulnerable we all are to our own hungers for youth, sex and good times. A winner!"
3,Too small for a hedgehog,"I got this for my hedgehog, Bo. When he was a baby everything was fine. As he grew to be a year old, not so much. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE PRODUCT, I just wasn't thinking ahead."
3,The piano creeps but Mary doesn't sing.,"This is not a review but a heads up for Mary Lorson fans. I bought this cd because I am quite fond of Mary's singing. Unfortunately, on this cd she sings on only one song."
4,Early Examples of That Sparkling Lubitsch Touch,"Strange thing about silent films -- to modern audiences, many seem as dated as a Hittite epic, while others are fresh as the day they were lensed. THE OYSTER PRINCESS, on delightful display here, is one of the latter. No wonder Hollywood couldn't wait to get the benefit of Lubitsch's sparkling comedy style -- much of this picture's laugh-out-loud funny. A dumpling of a comedienne, Ossi Oswalda's captivating in both pictures, but she's a particular hoot as the Oyster King's daughter, in a frenzy for a husband. The set and costume design are fascinating, the actors personable, the jokes good -- what's not to love? I DON'T WANT TO BE A MAN isn't quite up to that high standard -- a little slower -- but the sexual politics are fascinating, as are the glimpses of actual Berlin locations. Excellent restoration (thanks, Kino, for bringing us this series). Big fun!"
2,1985 and Counting,"Anyone who is thinking about buying this DVD and assuming that they cleaned up the film, digitally remastered the music and remade the experience for the Year 2000, think again. The DVD is grainy like a film, (you can actually see a hair(?) in part of an early shot) and was not really aligned properly with the frame. It is not in 8:5:1 format, so it shows like a television video. In other words, the format of the DVD was extremely disappointing for the price charged.Beyond that, it does serve the purpose I bought it for: watching something peaceful on my laptop while waiting, flying, etc. The snow shots don't hurt when you live in Dallas."
4,Headcleaner is great,"I downloaded this CD years ago, burned it, and lost but i have just recently boughtit! I think this cd is a very good buy. I think sounds vary from things like a greendayish sound to even a bad religionish sound. The only bad thing i can say is that the CD seems too short! I bought one, got it in three days and only paid like 4 bucks! Its worth checking out and i know you have 5 bucks!"
5,Best reference if you don't know,"it is really good to start Linux with this ONE book, as it covers every aspect of Linux. But if you want to dig deeper and find more helpful info, maybe you need to buy other books."
4,virus on the cd,The book is terrific but I found a virus on the CD. I notified Mr. Kabir but it is the publisher's responsibility and they did not provide an email address for complaints.virus is the Unix PSite virus and it is in the VetesCan-8-9-200.tar.gz file.Buyer beware!
4,"cypress hill - ""IV""",Great album by cypress hill....if i could i'd actually give it a 4 and a 1/2. Not a 5 because its not quite a classic but really close. DJ muggs really displays his skills as a producer on this album. The beats go hard!
5,Vintage Cypress Hill,"This is some classic Cypress Hill. There first 4 albums are all classics. Cypress Hill & Black Sunday are the 2 best, but this is probably my personal favorite. They come so hard here and do not sell out here. No commercial crap. You want commercial crap go to your 50cent's, your eminem's, your g-units, your d12s, your jay-z's. You aint gonna find it here. What you will find here is some REAL rap. They come out their hardest here, and stay underground, they keep this album the ""real"" cypress hill. On latter albums, they change their style too much. You want Cypress Hill at their best, then cop their first 4 albums, this is a good start. Best songs are Looking Through the Eye of a Pig, Dr Greenthumb, Tequila Sunrise, Nothin' To Lose, and the classic Checkmate, arguably one of their best songs ever. Every other song on this album are straight fire, the few i just listed are my favorites. Get this if u havent already, coz an essential classic for rap fans to own."
4,The most well-written book on the subject,"Tibet, Tibet is the best possible book to read for anyone interested in Tibet. It goes beyond being a travel guide in its capacity as travel journal. It goes beyond being a collection of biographies in its capacity as the vehicle for many people's life stories. It goes beyond being a historical treatise in its function as a relayer of events from Tibet's past. In truth, it is all these things, but improved with considerable humor, warmth, good writing, detail and any number of similar virtues. It is pleasant to read, entirely informative, moving and outlook-changing. It is excellent. Perhaps its most powerful and useful feature is its revision of the traditional view of Chairman Mao. The book reminds and awakens the reader to the truth of the 20th century's greatest mass-murderer.This book is admirable for its lack of false sentiment, its honesty without romanticizing. A true picture of Tibet, not an ideal.Buy it."
1,Am I listening to the same CD as these other people?,"This CD is trashbags. Period. Been a Tricky fan since Massive and I will tell you straight out that this voyage into the ""unknown"" really sucks. Anyone who says this tripe is better than Maxinquaye has tried too hard to live a rock & roll lifestyle...thus ingesting too much cocaine and heroin. This cd was better left in the studio on adat where no one would EVER find it. Juxtapose owns this CD. WHAT."
3,"Not what I expected, but still making rounds in my cd-player","Ok I was out one night with some money to burn, and I remebered this guy from the Chris Rock Show, and The Fifth Element. So I thought to myself why not give him a shot. Low and behold when I popped it in my CD player I was completly bored which is not a good thing since I was in My car driving. But it grew on me. It is like a mix between Pink Floyed, Miles Davis, and Rage Against The Machine. Fun backgorund music for parties or if you want to sit down cause your in a thinking mood. But not if you want to get roudy."
2,What happened?,"Did tricky start using more drugs than he normally does? This album has absolutley no strong point, it's on the verge of complete crap."
5,"Peak Vega, quality disc","This is one of my favorite music DVD's, and I have a lot.The song selection is terrific. ""Gypsy"" is probably my favorite, but a relatively obscure SV song. The sound is excellent. Suzanne was also at peak cuteness IMO at this point, and when she looks at the camera and smiles during ""Left of Center"" I'm just oh so happy about it.Unless you're very attached to Suzanne Vega songs after 2004, I see no reason why a fan of hers wouldn't love this DVD."
4,Great!,"This is the second movie in the J-Horror series - the third releases in January in Japan. And it's a Shimizu!Anyways, I thought that this was much much better than Infection. I thought the story was original and old/traditional in the way that it was a long time in the making. Anything else you need to know, you can find in SOIA1979's review which is detailed and pretty flawless- so not much else I can say!"
4,These wont let you down!,"Hey my name is trey miles, and i am a senior in high school. I have played on alot of different reed brands and types and i have found the rico royal reeds to be the best reeds because of response, tone, and to be good in various musical styles and playing situations."
3,Night of the Living Dead and The Evil Dead put together!,"This turned out to be a neat horror film with descent gruesome effects. Eric Larson and Francine Lapensee did a fairly good job in their roles. We also have good supporting roles by Sherry Bendorf (Who starred in a sick, gory, pointless, and disgusting teenage slasher flick ""Slaughterhouse"", and did a better job on this one)and Richard Gabai (Famous for his lame cheesy comedy flicks ""Assault of the Party Nerds "" and ""Virgin High""), who both did a fairly good job in this movie, which is ""Evil Dead"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"" in one, but alot better, with a better storyline!"
3,Fun Flick But Good?,"Demon Wind is a really entertaining fun, bad, Evil Dead type flick, but I wouldn't stretch the truth to say its ""good"".Its damn funny. If you like B horror with kitch, overdone fx, bad acting, and hot chicks you'll love it , but its not a horror masterpiece. I liked it enough to have bought a replacement copybut I like horror with kitch, overdone fx, bad acting, and hot chicks ;)"
1,Can't Play,When you need to get a Video graphics card and a memory card ( both cost over $30) what is the point in wasting all that money. No normal computer can play it.
2,weak,"I was excited to play this game and thought it might be pretty good when I started out. Graphics were good, sound effects and voice effects are good. but it doesn't take long to realize that it is just one new screen after another of fighting guys. That gets pretty old pretty fast."
1,Am I stupid or this book is too advance???,"This book doesn't clearify anything for you. No examples, No further explanation. It only keeps introduce various theories to you. It can compact theories that other books take 2-3 pages to explain it into 5 lines! I think you can imagine. Obviously, this book is not suitable to be your first book (not the second also). Buy it if you are sure that you are smart enough to understand it!"
4,Memory Lane,"How low key the festivals of this past era now seem. Audiences actually shut up and listened to the music and lyrics. The music makers cared about the world and influenced a generation, and changed history. A feast of talent presented in an honest and un flashy reality."
2,WHY?!,"No, no, no. Kern should have never been born. He is too dense, stupid, and his relationship with Listle was funny but grew dumb in the end. Phlan, a supposedly strong city, gets ruined 'cuz a damned hammer is lost. Gimme a break! Sirana is just another goof like her dad Marcus (see Pools of Darkness), even worse. Again, the extra star goes to Miltiades. This character is too cool, he should have been in another book! =D Seriously, I'm just glad there is no more sequels. Too lame for FR caliber."
3,BOOK DESCRIPTION,Description:DESCRITPION: THE HOLY HAMMER OF THE CHURCH OF TYR WAS CAPTURED BY THE EVIL GOD BANE TWO DECADES AGO. WHEN BANE WAS GESTROYED THE RELIC VANISHED. THE LEGACY OF RECOVERING THE LOST ITEM WAS GRANTED TO A PALADIN BEFORE HIS BIRTH. NOW THE YOUNG WARRIOR MUST FULLFILL HIS DESINTY.
4,Two glitches,"Very sad. Tracks 7 and 12 have quite obvious glitches, the first a squiggle, the second some static. Just two spots that I can tell, but unforgiveable on an otherwise fantastic album."
4,helpful,as a new manager of a store and 7 employees i was looking for some insightthis book has some really helpful tips
5,GREAT Service,The Brother Toner Cartridge was just what I wanted...even though I had ordered a generic. But the vendor decided since they were out of the generic they would send the Brother instead - AND in record time! Excellent service!
5,King of intense,"I copped the Fist n laurels double CD and I can't get enough! 2 CD's is just too little. For those who don't know Speedking is a NYC punk/thrash/kick [butt] band thats been tearing it up since mid 90s or so (maybe earlier?)so Fist and Laurel is a double CD with their unreleased album on the first CD and previously released 7"" singles on the 2nd. The album has a very beat pounding and progressive sound with some added moog embellishment from Matt Harmon and Justin Simon. There is also some songs updated by James Murphy who added a more electronic touch. Overall this creates a solid double set that rocks from top to botton,left to right. And while most of it is coming from recordings done it '97 it still sounds fresh and better than a lot of the so-called cutting edge stuff of today."
1,Build-A-Tan Face,"Was not happy with my purchase. Outdated merchandise. When using this product in the past I loved it. But with it being outdated, the fragrance was too strong. Not happy with my order."
1,"premier picture, generic sent","i received this today and it was not the premier pictured and clearly stated, but instead the generic yellow refill. blatant false advertising. very unhappy to have to deal with returning something now."
3,Didn't work on my STUBBORN Boston Terrier,I am sure this product works great for some people and their barking dogs. This didn't work on my very stubborn barking Boston. He would bark and then get blasted with the odor....then bark some more...he figured out to run the well dry multiple times a day! And my house smelled gross. I opted to use the water bottle to the face method instead and that is more effective on him. I am sure this will work on normal dogs though.
3,CITRONELLA PREMIER,THE SMELL WAS PRETTY GOOD TO PUT IN THE MACHINE SO IT WAS NOT BAD WHEN IT SQUIRTED AT THE DOG
5,terrific films make this a must have,"These are rare films and well worth adding to your Hammer collection, a Hammer collectors dream set you might say. It's just a pity that the case they come in wasn't thought out better. I'm tired of purchasing multi disc sets only to find it either darn near impossible to remove them from the holders (almost snapping the discs)or the hubs are broken and it's not always easy finding a multi disc case for a replacement. That is my only complaint with multi-disc sets.After all, it's hard enough to keep DVDs scratch free as it is.WE NEED BETTER MULTI CASES PLEASE."
5,how can you go wrong with a movie called the Snorkel?!?,"Strong stories, well defined driven characters, twists of fate and ironic endings are abundant in icons of suspense collection. All 6 films are worthwhile, running the gamut of suspense sci fi and crime dramas, with ""These are the damned"" and ""Cash on demand "" being especially memorable. The snorkel alone is worth the price of admission.The prints are real nice and the transfers are all great. Included are the trailers.Just when you thought you'd seen the bare minimum in multi dvd packaging from criterion and shaw brothers, here comes sony's icons of suspense collection in another ""experimental"" case.Oh well... great films, buy it."
5,"A ""Wise"" Approach to Leading and Managing","Patricia Yoder-Wise blends the attributes which nurses exhibit in their practice, care and compassion, knowledge and skill, and logically demonstrates their application in leadership and management areas of nursing. Throughout the book, whether discussing the management of people or resources, Yoder-Wise emphasizes the need for nurses to continue to learn, to care, and maintain their passion for nursing."
3,Non-Fiction,"Running with the Bulls by Luc Longley is one of those ghostwritten accounts, but interesting in that it gives some detail on one of the first Australians in modern times to play an important role on a National Basketball Association team.In particular, one that was good enough to win a championship. It also tells you about the importance and difficulty of obtaining emu oil."
1,Bizzare,"This book is one long run on sentence. It jumps from one idea to the next with out finishing much. Facts are wrong, places are wrong, if he can't get those correct, how likely is it that the rest of the facts got checked. A waste of money."
3,It Hurt My Head,"It was interesting stuff on the second listening, but the first time through was painful. Now I know why Bjork is such a space cadet."
2,No audio,"The TV has no audio. If you do not purchase the speakers, there will be no sound. I was extremely upset to have to connect external audio system. The image is fine."
4,Because They're Good For Ya!,"I like peanuts. And according to the medical folks, peanuts just might like me, too. So everyday I'll have a couple of handfuls of PLANTERS DRY ROASTED, LIGHTLY SALTED PEANUTS. And when you get the big 16-ounce jar that's a lot of handfuls.These goobers have 50% less sodium than the regular DRY ROASTED PEANUTS. As I (and most everyone else) need to cut back on my sodium intake, that's a big plus. Not only that, these oven-roasted nuts have zero cholesterol. So no wonder the medical people tell us snacks such as peanuts can be heart healthy; just don't overdo the snacking, as there are plenty of fat grams in a single serving. And the best thing about PLANTERS DRY ROASTED, LIGHTLY SALTED PEANUTS is the taste; they're a delcious snack (and your ticker will be thanking you).--D. Mikels, Esq."
1,Try a hand blender,"This frother does not work at all as claimed. It takes a lot of time to frothe just 1 oz of milk. And it never creates proper froth. I tried for full 5 minutes just for 1 cup and still did not get proper froth. It is just good for mixing protein or something. If you don't want to mix something with spoon, this is a good one, otherwise fro frothing please go to some other product."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"This was the biggest disapointment ever!! The chairs all arrived in smashed boxes, no packing inside to protect the chairs. All chairs were dammaged and even if they were perfect they were so wobbly I wouldn't let anyone sit on them. First time I have had a bad experiance from Amazon."
2,"Great idea, but they don't stick!","These are great for SMALL areas that you'd like not to appear to have a bandage applied, but they really don't stick. They hang on for about 30 minutes and then they're gone. I'm not sure why these bandages are not made with the same glue that they used to but something needs to be changed. If you can't go very long without reapplying it, what's the point? You're almost better off looking conspicuous and applying gauze and tape. At least you'll know that it will be there an hour from the time of application. It's a great idea but they really haven't figured out how to make it stick."
5,Just what I wanted for Christmas.....,"....and I got it! (Have faith, sometimes you do)What a lovely CD - I heard a radio programme about this band and resolved to find out more. But someone gave me the CD for a pressie and it was done for me. This CD just bounces with the enjoyment of music making - classical pieces played kwela (township?) style, and African folksongs in the style of Mozart etc. - it's great.A story for you - if you're wondering why there is birdsong on ""Songs my mother taught me""...there's a very famous recording of a (slightly eccentric) English 'cello player which begins ""I used to wander around the garden at night with my 'cello"". Anyway, upshot was, a friendly nightingale joined in (in perfect fifths) and coach parties from the East End (that's a poor part of London, or used to be)used to come to listen....An inspiration!"
2,poetic organization,"Though helpful, the book is not as well organized as one might want. It needs careful reading to extract the nuggets of publishers who would accept unknown poets."
5,great!,"this is probably one of the best soundtracks i have ever had the priviledge of buying. a beautiful array of artists ranging from the leaders of metal, rock, and soundtrack scoring with slayer, motorhead, and graeme revell.. all the way to lesser known bands who are amazing as well such as the kidneythieves and the screamin' cheetah wheelies. definitely 2 bands you should check out. in fact, kidneythieves just released their 3rd full length album ""live in chicago"" that is definitely worth checking out"
3,Not really my kinda music,"So why did I buy it then? Simply because during watching the absolutely brilliant film, one song stuck out. The fabulous version of Patsy Cline's ""Crazy"", by the Kidney Thieves, which was already a cover. This is a classic song, and the Kidney Thieves manage to put a new spin on it, with a husky voiced female, and a slow beginning, then it becomes really rocky towards the middle. This has always been a favourite song of mine, but now it's even better, so I've been playing it almost constantly. It really matches my mood at the moment too, and the lyrics are so appropriate for me right now. Just watch out when you play it, don't turn it up too loud to hear the beginning, cos believe me you'll be racing to turn it down when it hits the rocky middle.The rest of the music, is so not my kinda thing. For heavens sake, Motorhead are the music my dad actually likes. This soundtrack really isn't for a pop music fan (moi), but then it was never meant to be!"
3,it sounds pretty awful,Honestly this petal sounds pretty bad. It sucks a lot of tone from the guitar. It has potential for leads though. You get a lot of clarity from this thing when you solo really fast. It just has no tone.Get a dunlop mxr fullbore metal. It sounds way better for rythm guitar. Just not so good for leads though.It would be great of they came out with a petal that combined MT-2's fast action with mxr fullbore's excellent tone. It would make for one hell of a metal pedal.
3,Long winded,"This is a very long story for kids. My daughter, who delights in reading with me for up to an hour at a time, could not sit through even four pages of this book. I would have forced the issue if I had felt it was a great read and she was just not focused but I couldn't get into it either. Expect loooong wordy passages and little plot movement. I would maybe recommend it for an older elementary age child who needs some help with their creative writing (that's what the story is about)but I wouldn't really recommend it otherwise. There are so many other more interesting books out there!"
3,Not for Beginners,"The designs in this collection are beautiful and the photos are appealing, but they are not for beginning knitters. There are no diagrams of the pattern pieces to give a full view of each garment and the directions assume the knitter has experience with various shaping techniques."
3,Ditto to what others have said,"A more apt title might have been ""Yet More Bliss Baby Knits."" Since when is a long sleeved, tunic length sweater knit in moss stitch on size 3 needles quick? Even in baby sizes, a project like that takes time. There are many quicker Debbie Bliss baby sweaters in her other books. This might be a nice book to peruse at the library, but it probably wouldn't even make it home in my book bag."
1,Got wrong product - disgusting,"I ordered the BLUE, PLASTIC egg shaker for my 8 month old son's Easter basket. What arrived is a shaker egg that is made of what looks like rawhide. I did some research and it is the Meinl SKIN egg shaker. It doesn't specify what animal the skin comes from. Cow? Pig? Dog? Human? Who knows? I am horrified. Aside from being plain gross, it is a hazard, as my dog will immediately want to chew it, and could then get sick if he gets through the SKIN and releases the stones inside. I am angry that I wasn't sent the product that I ordered."
5,A guilty pleasure,"Alma Tadema is not nearly as well-regarded as others who painted in the same era, but there is something about his work that is compelling. This book is nicely done and a real value."
4,Good intro... however short-handed it is.,"I was assigned to read this first in a class on Self & Nature. It's a pretty good introduction to the question of personal identity and what it means to exist. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that it is slanted towards the modern, popular atheist-materialist camp. Worth it, regardless. He utilizes the Socratic style very well through the voice of the dying professor."
5,Informative and useful: still valid though published 1972,"I have used _Monastery and Cathedral_ as a teaching text and as a guidebook. It's worth lugging through France, even by train: photos are b/w but well chosen & informative, and follow the text well. Stoddard gives good contextual background and is clear in his description and explication of the most important medieval churches in France. Could do more with sculpture and symbolism: the main focus is architecture. But his section on treasures, manuscripts & stained glass is a good start. I'm about to use it as a text for an on-site summer course: it's a tried and true old friend."
4,"Less about the information, more about the tone","Let's face it - books on raising children tend to be pretty dry. Crouching Father, Hidden Toddler was good for a consistent laugh, and I can't tell you how nice that has been in the past few months. The whole zen approach is less important (and honestly feels a little tacked-on to me), but I legitimately enjoyed reading this book."
5,Dual recovery anonymous,This is an excellent book for those people suffering from dual disorders. It is self paced and can be used in conjunction with any other therapy the user is undergoing. The condition was as stated by the seller and the recipient has and is using it daily to help them in their quest for a better life.
4,Wonderful Book!,"This book is a wonderful story! All about a girl who is sent to school in a totally foreign country . On the way, she meets a boy and becomes casual friends. When she finds he lives near her boarding school, they become closer and gardually romance blooms! Also on the way you meet a bombshell with an attitude and a handsome hunk of a ski instructor. This book has been a favorite of mine for years."
1,Nothing special for this heavy price tag,I am very annoyed that this Baby Jogger stroller bar doesnt fit the said Baby Jogger City Series stroller model.
4,Spirit The Best Of Spirit,"I agree with most of the reviewers that this band was very underated.great singing electric and acoustic guitar playing and great songs.why were songs like Natures Way and I Got A Line not huge hits?I Got A Line made the top 40 I think.Natures Way was a great acoustic ballad.also Nothing To Hide has a nice acoustic/electric section.also Mister Skin could of been a hit catchy.this band was better than a lot of the crap that came out in the late 1960's all the bad hippie bands of that era.as for the whole album I think it would get five stars if it had some live tracks as bonus cuts,like a live I Got A line or Natures Way live hearing that live would of been fun. I heard samples on a live Spirit cd.a great unknown band that everyone should give a listen to and to remember what real musicians and songs were about in the old days."
2,did not stand the test of time,"We all dug Spirit in the 60s but unfortunately they don't translate very well today. But, to hear ""Fresh Garbage"" again,was a treat"
4,Spirit,"Not crazy about every track but lots of fun old hippie music, like Natures Way and I got a line on you. Nostalgic."
5,The Spirit is still there,"After many years of taking delicate care of my album version of Best of Spirit, I finally broke down and bought the CD. If you are any type of Rock & Roll fan, you should check this out. And I will be the first to admit that greatest hits albums don't always do the band justice. Much of this music was recorded in 1967 & 1968 and it really holds up. ""I Gotta Line On You"" is worth the cd by itself, but there are plenty of other great songs like ""Fresh Garbage,"" ""Mr. Skin"", and ""1984."" Two other interesting facts that speak to how great this band was is Led Zeppelin backed them up on an early tour, and Randy California the lead singer once played with Jimi Hendrix. Makes you want to go back to 1968 to see them live. Cool stuff."
5,Delightful DVD for toddlers,"My wife and I stumbled across our first Charlie & Lola DVD by accident while trolling the web for educational DVDs for our 2+ years son. What a delightful surprise! While there is no shortage of DVDs on letters, words and numbers, they often feel like a vitamin: good for you, but taste awful. The Charlie & Lola series instead teaches social lessons about getting along with others, taking responsibility, dealing with your emotions, etc. All of this is done in the context of a story that feels genuine and is entertaining for adults as well. Best of all, Charlie & Lola and their friends are all intelligent and sophisticated, yet unmistakably kids. The DVDs are based on a series of books that we have just begun to discover. Our son is delighted to read them all and laughs uproariously when he realizes that we are reading a book that is the same story as one of the DVDs we just watched: it makes him even more interested in reading."
5,20 years without bio...,"When I decided to go back to school for nursing! I really needed to prepare, in advance, before I got into a class where credit counted! I studied this book for the past 4 months in anticipation of a class I am taking in the Fall. I feel very prepared as a result of this book."
3,"Good, But Read With Caution!","As a physician recently diagnosed with prostate cancer, I found the book entertaining and easy to read in 2-3 hours due to the large text. I applaud him for encouraging men to have their prostates checked starting in their 40's. Unfortunately, the book is directed to Blacks more than to all men. The reader is cautioned that the author delays treatment and eventually chooses one form of therapy at a specific institution. The treatment option that has the greatest chance for cure is downplayed. Use this book as only one resource among several. Also, I would have liked more encouragement to let the diagnosis change your life for the better. Best wishes."
5,Martin Sexton on onelist,"Hello,I'm a fan of Marty's from Delaware. I've posted my opinions of The American and Black Sheep on Here. The American is very good. Black Sheep is the best record I've ever bought. Marty is a tremendously gifted singer, musician, songwriter, etc. His live shows are the best!!! I've seen Marty a little over 30 times in the past 3 years and I hope to see him 30 more in the next 3. Each and every show he blows me away. A discussion group has been started for Marty's fans at ONELIST. Check it out."
3,Yet another mediocre record,"This cd is so so,and once again includes some very commercialized songs such as plummets ""damaged"",hope that all the good dj's dont go mainstream,cuz that would suck.Songs worth the listen on this album are ""sorry ass dj""and ""back to the beat box""...this album doesnt showcase the true works of dj X,such as some of the earlier funky breaks or club experience albums."
5,"THE BEST ""TOY"" INVESTMENT",I PURCHASED THIS MTV KARAOKE MACHINE FOR MY 7 YEAR OLD. I MUST SAY THAT NOT ONLY DID SHE LOVE IT BUT EVERYONE WHO CAME TO VISIT ON CHRISTMAS HAD TO TRY IT OUT! I WAS VERY IMPRESSED. EVEN THOUGH MOST PEOPLE SAY IT IS NOT A LEARNING ACTIVITY I WOULD HAVE TO DISAGREE BECAUSE I THINK IT HELPS THEIR READING ABILITY. WITH SOME OF THE FAST SONGS MY DAUGHTER HAD TO READ FAST AND PRONOUNCE WORDS THAT WERE UNFAMILIAR. THEREFORE I THINK IT IS A GOOD LEARNING TOOL FOR READING. I READ ALOT OF REVIEWS ON ALL TYPES OF KARAOKE MACHINES AND THIS ONE HAD THE BEST REVIEWS AND I MUST ADMIT THE REVIEWS DID NOT LET ME DOWN SO FOR ANYONE OUT THERE CONTEMPLATING I SAY GO FOR IT!!!! IT'S FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY!! I ESPESIALLY LUV THE TV SCREEN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TRY TO HOOK UP ALL KINDS OF PLUGS TO ANOTHER TV...YOU CAN ALSO TAKE IT ANYWHERE AND HAVE A GREAT TIME....
1,What a let down!,It was okay for about 2 weeks until the TV completely stopped working (my daughter is VERY upset). Now I have to send it back to the manufacturer at my own expense (and cross my fingers that they'll fix it). The cost of sending it back will probably be close to the cost of the item. SAVE YOUR MONEY OR BUY IT AT A LOCAL STORE!!
5,Tending Roses,"I loved this book! While it is entertaining and a quick read, it also has a strong thread of spirtuality that runs through it without being overt. I've read several passages again and again because they were so truly pure and meaningful. It made me reconsider many issues in my own life. I highly recommend it!"
2,I really wanted to like this book . . .,"I really wanted to like this book. It was heartwarming, touching, the setting was nice, and the characters were believeable. But I just could not care about their problems. There just seemed to be too many problems, and they seemed too ordinary. In the end, the writing style and the plot, while nice, could not generate in me enough interest to get me to want to keep reading. It's a nice book for somebody, but the pace was just too slow for me."
5,My dogs LOVE these beds,"I have a 25 lb Jack Russel Terrier and a 14 pound Rat Terrier. Both of these poochies love this bed. I initially bought one thinking it would be big enough for both of them, but wound up buying a second as they both kept hogging it and not letting the other dog have ""the good spot"".Quality made, attractive, and the doggies love it, I would recommend it highly."
3,not their best work,"this album has a nice beat but not much else. all four mixes sound too much alike to be counted as different songs. i would really reccomend spending more money for a quality album, such as 6.0"
4,"great, lacks software",great handheld. excellent color screen. only problem is that it does not have documents to go software and that you need a memory stick to transfer fotos to the handheld
3,Disapointed w/ Clie SJ22,"Even though the Sony Clie SJ22 has a great color screen and the scroll button on the side is very handy, I am disapointed overall with this palm. Firstly, the sony doesn't allow you to jot notes directly on the screen for quick note taking. And not only do you have to buy the cradle and the owners manual seperatly, but you also have to buy a memory stick to hold photos. I was interested in this model initially because of the screen resoluting, but installing pictures is such a hassle it doesn't even seem worth the trouble."
1,Short on Software,"Just got the Sony PEG-SJ22 for Christmas and was very disappointed after several hours and mushing thru the Sony phone tree and a call center somewhere, that it will not sync with Microsoft Outlook-it will sync with email but not the calendar or address book. You have to purchase additional software for about $69.95. If you use Outlook and like keeping your calendar and contacts tied between your PDA and laptop--don't buy this Sony."
1,don't buy if you want to sync with Outlook,"I heard raves about the Clie products & was very excited that the price of the CJ22 (color) came down to <$.... However, not very happy to find out that the Intellisync software needed to hotsync with Microsoft Outlook was not included. The installation CD-ROM clearly says that it's there & the written instruction/installation documentation also shows steps how to select the hotsync software. Doesn't work when you try & install. I wasted an entire day trying to get this to work & the support staff at Sony have been less than helpful."
2,Old Technology but great on the computer,I have used the calender for years and thought the hand held would be even better but could not get it to work. Still trying and I think it is good but old technology
5,Finally a measuring cup that is easy to use!,"Tired of having to eyeball your measuring cup? Tired of guessing that it is ""just right?"" Well, you have to try this one. No more bending over, no more lifting the cup to eye level, no more putting the cup on a shelf to see if it really is the measurement you want. You can just look down into this cup and you can SEE!The only draw-back that I can notice on this measuring cup is that it is plastic and you won't want to put boiling water into it. But other then that...I LOVE it!"
3,Works as advertised.,"I like the angle measuring feature; it's what I bought it for. However, since it's plastic, I'm concerned about the durability, especially when compared to my Pyrex measuring cups. I find myself using the Pyrex cup when I'm not being so [obsessive] about the exact measure."
4,Great buy,"I bought 2 of these, one for me and one for my mother in law. She loves hers and the fact that she doesn't have to bend over to read where whatever she is pouring is at on the measuring cup. She uses it with fats and never has any trouble getting it clean - just throws it in the dishwasher - presto, clean!I also love mine. I don't have troubles getting it clean either. I do miss being able to stir in it easily or using it in the microwave. I still have my glass pyrex for anything requiring either of those, but most of the time I am grabbing this one for everyday use."
2,Hairline crack formed,"A hairline crack formed in a star formation, centered on the bottom of the cup.At this price expecting it to last longer than 2 yrs."
4,Good idea but needs tweaking.,"I love the idea of this cup and I use it all the time but the design does make it hard to scrape ingredients out. It is hard to tell from the pic but there is a ""ledge"" inside that makes it impossible to sweep a spatula around the inside. I would also greatly welcome a glass version."
4,great for liquid measuring... just wish I could nuke it,"This is a great measuring cup, as it accurately measures liquids. However, I wish that I could put it in the microwave. If someone designs a microwave, dishwasher, freezer safe liquid measuring cup, I might have to hand it 5 stars."
1,"SHOULD HAVE BEEN, NEEDS TO BE, GLASS","This measuring cup was a great idea, except for its plastic construction. Plastic gives it several major drawbacks:a.) You cannot put hot liquids into it.b.) You cannot put it into a microwave (a little known fact: NEVER put any plastic container into a microwave, as plastic outgasses when heated and contaminates the food).c.) It is too lightweight, top-heavy when filled and waaaay too easily knocked over.We've gone back to our old Pyrex measuring cup. This one went into the garage sale pile.OXO, build it out of glass, and we're there."
5,Good cup,"I can't add much to what has already been said, but i felt like saying something. This is a wonderful product. The quality expected from OXO and the ease of use of the slanted measurements. Definitely a good buy."
5,Mosby's First Responder Textbook is,Just completer a 60 hour corse on EMS/First Responder trainingand this was by far the book to study from. Covers all aspects of thefield to include AED's and lots of good pictures.
5,Wayman plays from the soul,"man...I can't say enough about this album. I've had this album for a few years now along with everything else released by Tisdale. I absolutely love this album. There are about 5 smooth jazz songs in my entire collection that can bring my hectic world to a soothing, fuzzy, warm, anesthetic, calm. ""Fell in Love"" is one of those. The Everette Harp/Tisdale collaboration is outstanding. By the way, ""Better Days"" the Harp/Tisdale collaboration on the title track of Harp's album is also one of the those magical five songs. Truly spirit-lifting music."
3,can he confirm he has made the right decision ?,"There is more than simply the anecdotical aspect that Wayman Tisdale played for more than 12 years in the NBA. It is a fact that Tisdale is a Marcus Miller disciple, and more than one track confirms it. Frenchman Marc Antoine also plays duo with Tisdale on a track. Not having heard ""in the zone"" or ""power forward"", it is hard for me to say if he's getting better or not, but it is an artist I will keep an eye on, because he DOES show he has more than average qualities and ability to become a great artist. In any case, I play it regularly on my show, on a Spanish F.M. radio."
3,"Good, if you like repitition","The mixes on this CD are quite similar to the original track. The original is even on the CD. The single from the Mortal Kombat Soundtrack is on it along with two tracks that are exactly the same except for length. The high point of this CD is the track Kraut. It is very close to the song Disobedience, but is still good. KMFDM fans must own, dance enthusiasts will enjoy, ANGST lovers won't really enjoy"
2,"Pretty poor single, 2 songs, 4 minute version of title track","""Be my, sister salvation; closer now - see the revelation."" The title track, Juke-Joint Jezebel is one good techno / industrial song, with a nice beat, good kicking bass for which make this song great to dance to. This version of Juke-Joint Jezebel is a 4 minute edit. Kraut is 5 minutes long and offers a completely different industrial beat, with a heavy guitar, a quick beat from a drum machine, a xylophone and a keyboard. This is not a very appealing song when compared to Juke-Joint Jezebel. With a review of two songs, its time to say, that there are only two songs! Which is why this single is selling new for around fifty cents. At least with that price, this makes it a worthwhile single to at least give a listen to. On the cover is a traditional KMFDM sketching of a woman with short hair and a large, singing into a microphone. The insert of the jewel case has the lyrics to Juke-Joint Jezebel, but not Kraut."
5,Great Movie,"I really enjoyed the movie. I thought the acting was well done, news faces. The lead role played by Erica Giles was done especially well, hoping to see her in future roles."
4,Pretty good PDA,"I know its pretty hard for you new pda buyers to choose the right pda. tg50 was my first pda and i thought it was a pretty good pick. it looks great. the flaws about this pda is that the keyboard button is a bit small but i got used to that. also another which isnt a big deal is the stylus is located on the bottom of the pda and it would slip out once in a long while. the good thing about this is that the color is great. the remote control feature is pretty cool too. look-wise this pda is very sexy. right now im trying to get online with my pda and im waiting for bluetooth dongle to come. if you guys dont need to go online with your pda, i suggest that you get the palm zire witht he camera, i think thats a pretty good palm at a great price."
1,Sony sucks!,"I was a fanatic of SONY for years. My land phone, my stereo, my tv, my laptop, my handheld, anything that could have the SONY logo in it. Anytime I needed support had to pay good money, but though worthwhile. During the years SONY faded; they didn't had the accessories I needed, until they didn't want to help my at all. This purchasing was the last I did as the loyal Chilean customer I always was. The Clie failed two months after I bought it and Sony didn't want to support me anyway possible for fixing it. I climbed the Customer Service tree until the Latin America office: didn't have even a reply. Since then, I sold all my SONY's devices and never have considered SONY for any of my purchasing."
2,Neither Good Fruit Nor Good Candy.,"Well, I'm not certain how these ""Fruit by the Roll"" thingies got into the house. I would never buy them. Perhaps they're something left over from our last Halloween Day give-aways. In any case, neither my wife nor I will eat them, and I'm hesitant to give them to the baby. They're neither good fruit nor are they good candy. They taste about as much like fruit as Kool-Aid does. I tried one and it stuck tightly to my teeth. Great, just what I need, some sugary stuff stuck to my teeth. I'm going to make certain all are out of the house this Halloween, but maybe I shouldn't do that to the neighborhood kids. Perhaps I should just throw them out.Gary Peterson"
5,Very good,"Easy to install and nice looking, just wish it would hold more utensils but can always buy a second one. Really like it."
5,Super product,"This tool rack was easy to mount. We keep it above our stove, so it is super convenient."
1,Very cheaply made,"These racks are very poor quality. The rods and wall attachments are made from very lightweight, thin metal, and almost feel like cheap plastic. The hooks themselves are also cheaply made, and sit unevenly on the rod.I sent these racks back for a refund, and made my own rack out of copper pipe and copper wire for the hooks. I'm glad I did."
3,A so-so sophomore effort,"While I enjoy Duncan Sheik's latest album, it lacks the intensity of his first album. None of the songs on ""Humming"" have the catchiness of ""Barely Breathing"" or ""She Runs Away"", although ""Bite Your Tongue"" comes close. I also miss the sense of closeness that the first album had, that peek into another person's private emotions. While ""Humming"" is certainly a worthy effort, I am left with an overall sense of fallen expectations. This isn't helped by the secret song at the end that seems to admit that the record isn't what it could be, and is just a ""foreshadowing of what's to come..."" Hmmmmm....I'll wait and see."
2,nice features - but not the best camera for a family with small children!,"I love the features that the camera offers. They're a bit redundant as they're the same types of things I use with my photo program anyway, but it's nice to have them available on the camera itself.My biggest complaint is that with a 2 year old and a 1 year old - trying to capture moments quickly is beyond frustrating with this camera. The half-press focus (hoping that it focuses on the area you're asking it to) seems to take a lifetime when you're trying to follow action! I've tried to just point and shoot - but the photos are never in focus.I've also found that the ""saving to memory"" time is rather long, even when you decrease the Megapixels.This would probably be a great camera for someone else, but for a mother of two - I would NOT recommend it. I've only had it 4 months and I'm online right now shopping for a new camera. :("
2,That Deceiving Title is a Matter of Opinion.,"Beware of marketing ploys like the title of this collection by various performers, because the only thing they share in these 18 tracks is their inherited ethnicity. This isn't so much an eclectic blend of various Irish musical culture as it is a collection of pop, blue-eyed soul, and country musicians who are most likely only well-known within their borders.I will give the label kudos for such gems as the two Wolfe Tones songs, ""My Heart is in Ireland"" and my personal fave on this disc, ""Streets of New York,"" ""The Green Fields of France"" by The Fureys, Meav's ""She Moved Through the Fair,"" and Clannad's ""Dulaman."" If you're looking for anything more ""Irish"" on the other baker's dozen tracks, you will come away disappointed unless you enjoy second rate songs from alternative genres. If this is the case, you will be better off purchasing individual albums by Sinead O'Connor, U2, and The Cranberries."
3,OK Rattle,"It does what it says it does - shake and makes a rattling noise. That said, my son quickly grew bored with it and only occasionally bothers to shake it - and that is typically within the context of another toy. These are probably great for younder kids but not so much for my 14-month-old."
4,more (or less) hits than you asked for,"Phil Collins has always been one of my favorite musical artists. When this album was released and True Colors hit the airwaves, it showed how remarkable this man's journey through stardom over the past 20 years was.Hits includes the songs that made Phil what he is; the slick tune with the drum solo In The Air Tonight; the best ballad ever written Against All Odds; the sentimental and dedicative Another Day In Paradise; the chilling I Wish It Would Rain Down; the fun pop grips of Easy Lover and You Can't Hurry Love; the groovy One More Night; and the incredible Take Me Home.However, many songs were left out; I Don't Care Anymore, Don't Lose My Number, Do You Remember?, Everyday, It's In Your Eyes, and my favorite Find A Way To My Heart from But Seriously.Still, the songs offered on Hits are worth having this album available to you...seriously!RecommendedB+"
5,EXCELLENT,"If you like Phil Collins in his solo career day's then you will love this cd , it has all of his greatest hits. a++++++++++++++"
4,"75 % excellent, 25% not","Phil Collins is a tough artist to put together a greatest hits collection for ... what do you put on it? This collection is very good. If you're a fan of all the big hits, they're all here. I can't really think of one major solo hit that's missing (maybe We Said Hello Goodbye?).Of course, there will be several songs that big fans will say are missing that were just album tracks that were popular with radio play (Inside Out, Find a Way to My Heart & I Don't Care Anymore come to mind quickly); to include everything would probably require 2 discs.While almost every song here is excellent, the ones that I don't like I so strongly dislike that unfortunately it brings down the rating for me. Seperate Lives & Both Sides? Yuck!!!This will not detract the casual or hardcore fan though from loving this collection. It sure did not detract me! Enjoy."
4,Great Collection....but missing some crucial songs,"This is a great collection but is missing 3 crucial songs: ""I don't Care Anymore,"" ""I Missed Again"" and ""Don't Lose My Number"" (most unfortunate since this is one of my favorite solo songs from him). Hopefully, a 2nd collection will eventually come out or they will release a 2-cd collection someday that corrects this problem."
4,Worth it,"I usually listen to R&B and Hip-Hop, but I've always liked Phil Collins. This CD is a great buy for those of us who just want to relax every now and then with a good CD. I was only a little disappointed that In Too Deep wasn't on there, but I guess now I'll just have to purchase Invisible Touch to get it. If you like Genesis, or just Phil Collins, this CD is definitely worth the money."
1,DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"We've had the MobiBlu for 6 months. Its a real neat product, however the battery life will progressively get worse. There is no way to replace battery at this time although the company says they'll have that information posted on their website soon and they've been saying that for months...and the tech support is NON EXISTENT. NO ONE REPLIES. So if you dont mind terrible support..then its a cool product."
3,A good start - but no finish,"OK, I'm a big Steve Martini fan also. In the beginning of this book it seems very promising. It almost seemed like after he had the malicious Zo Suade offed that he lost his train of thought. A rather air tight case of circumstancial evidence builds against Paul Madriani's client and you wait for a plausable explanation that it was really someone else. Suddenly he is off to Mexico and after a series of improbable events the mystery is solved...or is it? Borrowing heavily from Scott Thurow's Presumed Innocent, Martini throws in a little twist at the end. To my mind it was an unsatisfying finish to a book that showed promise. I hope this is an aberation and that his next one will find him returning to form."
3,Heavy Legal Thriller,"This is the 2nd Madriani novel I have read and I would rate them both as good. Not great; but a decent read. The book has a good story involving kidnapping, drug dealers, and a lot of courtroom activity.His books would be better if there was some more sarcasm or touches or humor. The characters need more depth where the reader can relate. After this second book, I can't even picture what Paul would look like or who would play him in a movie.The courtroom activity was a tad drawn out but what do you expect with a name like ""The Attorney""As many others have stated, I also find the ending to this and his other books to be transparent."
3,A Fast Read,"This is another Paul Madriani story. It flows fast, I read it in one day. The story starts out with him taking on a Lottery winnig client who is trying to regained his kidnapped grandchild. The clint ends up needing his help to fight off a murder charge that seems to be connected to the kidnapping. The story is fun but has a couple of holes, still fun. You are given a couple of clues, but I do not think you will figure out the end of the book until you read it...."
3,I'm a little confused,I have just finished reading The Attorney. The thing that just doesn't register with me is how did that cigar get on the body of the victim Suade. I liked the story and the way the author develops the characters. But if Ontaveroz was not in the car the ending doesn't add up. Maybe I am missing something but I did go back and read the ending chapters again.
2,Where oh where is an honest review these days?,"Chicago Tribune, said, ""Plenty of zigs and zags in the plotting make this another strong outing for Martini."" Their purpose is to sell. Remember that. I will always read Steve Martini's riveting tales, but this one, The Attorney, was ho-hum. Predictable, forced action. No surprizes. Same thing is happening to Grisham. I can barely get through Grisham's latest and I haven't found a hero yet."
1,"Boring, boring, boring, very disappointed",I was so looking forward to the new Martini book. What a disappointment. I could barely get thru it and couldn't wait to finish it. Have really liked all of his previous books.
1,Battery has internal fault after two days,"After installing the new battery in my APC unit, I let it charge.Two days later I came home and found the fault light blinking. Iconnected to the unit with the apc software and is said thebatter had an internal fault....Bummer."
2,No longer geniune APC. Received ExcessUPS branded.,Previous customers were receiving a genuine APC branded battery. That isn't the case anymore. Received an ExcessUPS branded battery. Purchased May 2012.
2,Poor life,"When I first purchased my battery backup, the original battery life was 3 years now I can barely get a year and and a half. Purchased this in April of 2010 now the replacement light is back on."
5,BUY GENUINE APC BATTERIES !!,"I had premature end of life with ""generic"" non-APC batteries and learned for best performance and LONGEST LIFE always BUY GENUINE APC BATTERIES !!"
1,EXCESSUPS (not APC),"That's what I got[...]and that's what was on the picture.[...]I was not ordering ""compatible"". i was ordering the real thing."
2,"Bad Quality, Leaks","APC used to make batteries that were outstanding quality. But my genuine APC battery went dead after only two years in my reliable BE650R. When I opened the power supply to replace the battery, I saw that the case of this battery had split open at the end and was leaking acid!One tech support call to APC later and I was told that the battery leakage was the fault of my APC product, and they offered to sell me a new UPC (no discount). Evidently APC feels that their products are useful only until they decide it's time to sell you a new one.I've now started using non-APC brand batteries."
2,Love the A-Team??,"Stephen Cannell created the televison series ""The A-Team"". If you loved that show with its implausible actions and its predictable results, you'll also love this novel.If you're not yet convinced, maybe the fact that Cannell constantly and repeatedly referred to ""Heidi Fleiss"" (the Hollywood madam) in the book to such an extent ..."
5,a truly great single,"This single contains three songs,1.Sweet Summer 2.Anjali and 3.Spoonfed(the album version),the first two songs are new,and being a huge fan of the full length Echobrain album I think the new songs are great.These songs continue to showcase the stellar songwriting,and musicianship of the band.In addition to the new songs,this is also an enhanced cd that contains a thirteen minute movie of studio and interview footage.This single is a must have if you liked the full length,it also comes in a digipak case with great artwork."
4,Good to keep the humor,"Whats up I thought this CD Prolonging the Magic was awsome. I totally disagree with the other guys view of growing up and stuff. The thing that attracted me most to your music was the humor of your lyrics. I do agree that this CD is great though, I can play some of the songs to my girlfreind when she is mad at me. Thanx, from a huge fan."
3,Good music but not as good as I've come to expect from Cake!,"I loved ""Fashion Nugget"" and ""Motorcade of Generosity"" - humor and musical talent, together at last! I liked this album, don't get me wrong, but it's not on the same level as FN or MOG. The songs are too depressing, it kind of feels like a bunch of songs that didn't make it onto the first two albums. Let's hope Cake got the blues out of their system, I still wanna see 'em in concert, and I'm looking forward to their next one."
5,"This Cd is just as great as the others, if not better!",I first got into Cake when my sister sat me down and played Motorcade of Generosity straight through from beginning to end. I fell in love with the music and I have all three of Cake's CDs. I listen to them all of the time. Cake is so unique and that is why I like the music so much! No other band can compare.
2,Dissapointing,"I picked this one up because i heard Never there, Hem of your Garment and Sheep go to Heaven. I loved all three of thos songs. When i bought the album hoever, Those are the only ones that were any good. There were a couple other songs that were mediore at best. Do yourself a favor, dowlnoad Never there off of napster or itunes and save yourself some cash. Either that or just pick up Fasion Nugget."
4,This c.d. is great!,"i recently purchased prolonging the magic i love it!A few of the songs are pretty strange but its ,overall,a great addition to my c.d. collection.Oh,and Never There is the BEST SONG in the world!!!!!!"
4,Great Music - Not Remastered,"While the music is the best, the recording is not. The people who released the CD did nothing to clean up the quality before release. That is disappointing. Also the cover leaves fails to mention that Ray McKinley is the drummer on the recording. Big oversight. The liner notes have some good information on the session. They were lifted from the book, ""Next to a Letter from Home,"" a story of the Army Airforce Orchestra during World War II."
5,Great Resource,"I found Mr. Lewis's approach to exploring multiracial issues down-to-earth and mindful of historical context, and this sets his book apart from some of the other works addressing the same subject matter. I used an entire pack of Post-Its marking pages containing uncommon insights and/or useful information. Thanks for a great read! -Louie Gong, MAVIN Foundation"
2,The Company Of Cats,"Marian Babson's The Company Of Cats turns a gossip column informant into an interior decorator for an eccentric multimillionaire. The subsequent murders and line up of suspects lacks the usual flair of Miss Babson's best work. The ingredients for a good light-hearted read are all there, but somehow the unexpected will, thoroughly unpleasant suspects, hidden money stash, missing cat and the subsequent parade of impostors just didn't jell. The only memorable characters were the three cats- Sally, Salvatore and Sassy. Unfortunately, this mystery just wasn't the ""cat's meow."""
1,Unreasonable price,"This is a really great book, but you can get it new for $64 from most speech and language catalogs (Fall 2012). Why would you pay twice that for a used copy?"
3,Good but exhausting...,"I know this book would have been better if I hadn't just finished The Pirate and the Pagan yesterday. If you have read that book you understand what an emotional rollercoaster it is. So today I am reading the Hawk and the Dove and finding myself enjoying the beginning...loving the characters, but as I was nearing the conclusion of the tale I found myself completely emotionally drained and wishing the damned thing would be over. Hence the 3 stars.The Plot, while good in the beginning, lost its progression during all the intrigues in the Elizabethian Court. I love that Hawk is so desperately in love with Sabre, and I love how hot tempered she is so I get all the intense sex scenes. But I definitely would have enjoyed the story more had she just fessed up about a hundred pages sooner."
3,where's the beef?,"Sorry, I was expecting the complete soundtrack from the movie. I must have misread the description. What I received was the incidental music, which is nice, but a bit repetitious. What happened to the hymns, the ones the ladies sang outside the Baby's house? Perhaps they were incorporated into the music and not credited? I love the movie nevertheless-AC"
4,mellow blues,This guy is no Jimi Hendrix but he knows his way around the blues. His style is laid back R&B and easy. Mainly original selections. I like this CD a lot.
2,Not worth the money.,According to the directions on the bottle this product has to be applied daily. But according to the advertisement this product last one week. No where on the bottle does it says that it will last one week. The product works but the bottle don't last for long. Not worth it!
3,smells horrible inside,another customer said it smelled like apples? Doesnt smell anything like that to me. Smells horrible! Also dosent seem to deter my cat.
3,Decent but not great.,"All these reviews are over-hyped. Dont get sucked in. Bloque is a decent album, but there are better rock en espanol albums out there."
4,Great stuff!!!,"This is great stuff for anyone who loves both rock and latin rhythms. Both the musicians and vocalists are excellent. If you are tired of the typical rock scene, as I am, you may find listening to this both refreshing and revitalizing."
5,Fantastic!!!,Bloque are the most innovative Latin alternative group I've heard in a long time. This record is definitely worth picking up - they're also amazing live.
5,Totally AWESOME!!,I've been a fan of Billy since One Voice came out and he has not disappoint me ever. No exception from this cd. This album is filled with beautiful and rich vocals with inspirational story behind every song. This album is bound to help you to get through the hard times. Very motivational and touching. One of the greatest album I ever heard ever. And his voice is one of the very finest voice i ever heard in my entire life.
5,Music Through Heartsongs,"Wonderful cd. What a voice Billy Gilman has! Truly a gift from God. We are so proud of him, not only in his singing but how he cares for others. Look forward to new cds from him. I think we have all the older ones."
4,A Good CD but no one of best one by Billy Gilman,"Billy Gilman is a great musical singers and how one of them most amazing shows, because he puts his heart into the show. This cd is good, but not great. It does really allow Billy Gilman to show is unbelievable talents. From the last shows I have seen in personal (after this cd came out), people at the show, including me, thought Billy Gilman's voice is even better than before. Better than this CD. Buys this cd and be sure to be the next one when it comes out becuase it will be unbelivable. Thanks Billy"
4,Music Through Heartsongs,"WOW!! i liked this cd since listening to the first track!! i told some billyheads that as long as Pizza has CHEESE i would be reviewing this cd on here!! the songs that stand out for me are: For our world, i am/shades of life, about things that matter, songs of the wind, possession, gift of color and about watches!! i like fast songs so thats a given that i like about things that matter, about watches and gift of color!! but i like the hawaiian ukelele strumming in songs of the wind, makes it seem like almost love from dare to dream!! BUT being that the songs are poems without rhymes sounds a little strange, i don't know if i could sing along with them that easy!! the reason why i give it 4 stars is because some songs are kinda lacking in true power like the songs there's a hero, my time on earth and God's Alive and Well!! looking forward to the next cd with more rhyming words in the songs and more twang in it!"
1,Bad camera!!!!,"I bought this camera in November 2004 and by April 2005 it was dead. The lens motor is defective and even though it is still under warranty, Sony will not repair it. Thay want to charge me $140 to fix something that is defective in their camera. I would not buy this camera or any in the DSC line. I have seen many other reviews by others who have bought this camera and had the same problem."
1,Poor customer service,"Screen has loose connection, will go blank so nothing can be seen, customer service says it si a 150 dollars to repair, owned camera for 3 months."
1,"Great, until it broke","Good camera, working fine until it...umm...stopped working. Lens does not fully extend, it clicks / whirs / retracts and then comes up with the hint of 'turn the power on and off'. I could make it work (through a combination of screwing the lens back in, removing the batteries etc) for a while, but now completely defunct. Hoping that my insurance agreement with Pixmania.com will entitle me to a new (non-Sony I hasten to add) camera.Not recommended."
3,A OK camera,"The pictures looked very good on the LCD, but after you uploaded them to the computer, their quality is just so-so. Even those taken in good light out-door conditions and using super fine are very blurry, after you zoom them to 100%. The camera is so.. slow in low light environment, and needs at least 5 seconds time to take one single picture.Overall, this camera's OK if you just want to print it out to 4x6. If you want a really good camera, turn to Canon powershot serial."
2,SUCKS the life out of batteries so you can have DULL PICTURES.,"i got this camera in 12/03 and i can't even remember how many months i struggled with battery issues, how many packs of rechargable NiMH batteries, and a battery charger purchase later before i read other reviews and found that it was a common issue for this thing to mass murder AA batteries. when it does decide to work, about 1/3 of the pictures come back blurry, even when the subject is standing still. sadly, i already invested in a nice memory stick for this garbage."
2,a word of caution,"If you are looking for a thermometer for an old oven that does not have an oven light, this thermometer is not for you. It relies mostly on the oven light to backlight the face for reading. Otherwise it is a accurate, and clips to the rack very well."
2,keep looking,"It might gauge the heat fine, but after a few uses the screen turned so dark I can barely make out the numbers. Normally I like the OXO brand, but on this one they failed. Too bad :("
2,not a stand up item,"I believe this oven thermometer is accurate. It does, however, have other problems. After about two uses the screen clouded up so much that I have to take it out of the oven to read it. I was not able to find anything that would clean the screen so I believe the greyness is internal rather than external. Also,no matter how I put it in the oven (hanging or standing on the shelf) it falls over."
1,do not buy this thermometer!,"This thermometer is junk. Yes it is easy to read because of the clear dial, however, it does not register the temperature for at least 30 minutes! You will be baking for half the day just waiting to see the thermometer register the correct temp. Do not buy it. Instead buy a probe thermometer with dual functions (one for oven temp and one for meat temp). I cannot express enough my disappointment with this product. This one is junk."
2,"Poor acting, predictable story, disappointing ending","This movie started with obvious sexual frustration, predictable nudity, and poor acting. I knew from the first 15 minutes I was going to regret watching this movie. It had the ability to be so much more but the it did not live up to the ""thriller"" claim. I became physically frustrated watching this movie due to the weak story line and the thriller movie cliches that involve girls in these types of movies. This is by all means NOT a slasher film. I would have liked to see either a twist or surprise to give the movie a little more power but it just never came.This won't stop me from discovering the hidden gems of the big screen, it's just too bad I can't label this as a ""hidden gem""."
2,Save your time,"Very slow and boring, unless your some guy looking for insight on dumb 17 year old girls, they were ""stoned"" up until the ""strange man""comes in and then its like they never drank that 1 beer and 1 joint, bad plot, no action, not a horror or really a thriller, and nowhere close to a slasher film, im amazed that this is the lowest rating thus far!!!!!! only reason i gave it 2 stars and not 1 was that it only wasted 85 minutes of my time."
5,even after 25 years,"It is surprising to me that there are no more recent publications dealing with the same topics. While there are always new books, this book covers basics which are as true in the 21st century as in the first. Even today, this book is a useful tool"
1,Illustrated Stand Magazine Sherlock Holmes,The book I received was not the book I ordered.I ordered the book with the facsimile printing of the original Illustrated Strand Magazine articles complete with illustrations. The book I received did not have any illustrations.
3,Another side to UW,This is a great example of what this group has done and can do--their appraoch to the craft of making electronic music is truly genius. The EP captures the band in a more experiemental mode.
4,LIVE A LITTLE LOVE A LOT,"I SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT THE SHORT STORIES CONCERNING DON CAMILLO(PRIEST)AND PEPPONE(MAYOR)DISPLAY HUMOUR AT IT'S SPONTANEOUS INTENSE AND HILARITYAND IN ACTUAL FACT EVEN THOUGH THEY DISPLAY THEIR IDEOLOGY(POLITICAL ATEXTREMES)THEY PORTRAY VULNERABILITY AND A CERTAIN FORM OF AMENABLESPIRIT TO EACH OTHER MIXED WITH UNDERSTANDINGWRITTEN REVIEW OF THE ENGLISH VERSION DVD ""LITTLE WORLD OF DON CAMILLO"" BY MR.W.J. JANIK"
3,All over the place,"I've read so many books on spiritual ways to attract money, affirmations, etc. This one is poor in comparison. The title drew me in, but it talks more about everything else rather than how to attract money. i think this is an example of a book where the publisher changed the title to get more sales. The author doesnt even practice what he preaches, he even adds plenty of limiting beliefs when he teaches you how to invest (like the real estate market is not as great as it used to be. WRONG there are still plenty of people making tons of money in RE all over the country), He shouldn't be talking about investments in the first place because he doesn't seem to have a firm grasp on the subject. This book is really all over the place, it did not help me to focus at all because it was itself a mess."
5,Really Cool CD,"I love Punk Rock and always loved the Vandals, and this totaly rocks the planet buy it."
4,A Taste of Carmel,"Christmas in Carmel is a charming story set in the picturesque backdrop of Northern California. Mr. Mahoney keeps the reader well entertained with a very colorful cast of characters and a storyline that will bring a laugh or smile at every turn of the page. Mr. Mahoney has quite a talent for richly capturing the flavor of Carmel. I highly recommend ""Christmas in Carmel"" to any reader any time of the year! Un travail bien fait, M. Mahoney!"
4,Mahoney is a comer!,"Mr Mahoney constructs hilarity with a practiced eye. He is clearly a student of human nature. Mahoney has the ability to mold his characters into a form that is at once outrageous, then farcical and finally steers his reader towards a delightful romp in a world of fun and adventure. The whacky world he portrays is as jubuliant and expansive as a Jackson Pollack painting and as restrained and pristine as the Mona Lisa. This is a very talented writer. There were times I thought of Ken Kesey's work while readng this book.Mr Mahoney is a comer and many, including me, are eagerly anticipating his next work. The sooner the better"
3,Calder Drawings,"It was fun to see the Calder drawings, I was much more familar with his sculpture and enjoyed these drawings. Calder's work always has attracted me and I was happy to find another facet."
5,Clark Terry is such a babe,"I don't usually find myself attarcted to older men, but he's hot for hsi age! And his playing is wonderful, thsi is a great jazz cd!!! Wow, he's just so cute!!!"
4,Flavorful Italian Import,Very flavorful and makes a great drink. Imported and you will not be disappointed in your purchase. Make that wonderfully refreshing drink on a hot day.
3,"Good, but not a Masterpiece","I bought this book about a year ago after reading Orwell's 1984 for the first time, some other reading got in the way (mostly school related - I'm a med student) but this spring break I decided to go for it.The first few chapters are truly captivating. There is something very active about the narrator's voice and how he establishes mood, describes the most inner details, hints on character relations, etc. This is lost as I continued on through the next chapters, and somewhat picked up near the end. Maybe I missed something throughout my reading, if anyone cares to point out flaws in my review.It is good reading and obviously highly influential in later publications by other authors, but I found 1984 and Fahrenheit 451 to be more shocking and controversial throughout the whole book. Next on my shelf is A Clockwork Orange."
4,a disturbing social mirror,"Written in the 1930s, he forecasts a dim future of only a few hundred years ahead (then updated to less than a century). A very good story of a good plan for society gone bad.Though written purely as a fiction, it's disturbing to see how much society has fallen into his idea of a ""petty, emotionless society""."
2,This book details the crimes of serial killer H. Glatman.,"The book seems repetitive three quarters of the way through and I was unable to complete the entire book. There are many other ""better"" true crime reads than this title."
4,high quality,"great product. cheapest price you can find.if I have to say something bad, a little bit heavy but still handy"
2,Sturdy & Not so comfy,"I had bought one office chair from Ikea for 69$ and it was not so good. Then based on the reviews I thought this should be very good chair. But I am dissapointed that the comfort from this chair is similar to Ikea chair, now the problem with Amazon would be you cant return if you dont like.. because you need to pay for shipping charges. So I will be living with this chair .."
3,Office Star Chair,The chair was not as comfortable as I expected. If I had a choice again I would not choose it.
4,Office star space proffessional,"This is a great chair for the price. Easy to assemble and very light. Comfortable to sit in for hours on end, which I do every day"
4,Great combo of price and comfort,We had been looking for mid back chair with an air grid back but most did not have the features that we wanted. This chair has a great combo of features at a reasonable price. The leather seating is great and we really like the lumbar support. Adjustments are easy and the assembly went very fast. This is a good value.
2,Not true Harley music,I bought this with great anticipation. I was quite disappointed when I got it. Billy Idol was never one of my favorites. I don't recommend this one. Save your money for something else.
1,I Didn't Laugh Once,"I'm glad other buyers found this DVD hilarious, but I thought it was relentlessly unfunny. I bought it for my brother-in-law for Christmas, since he loves Hawaii and all the reviews were positive. We tried to watch it last night. To start with, Rap's speech pattern is difficult to understand and the muddy soundtrack doesn't help. His ""jokes"" are terrible and his sketches look like something a failing student would produce with all his stoner buddies in a High School Audio/Visual class. There wasn't a single moment of wit or insight. You're better off spending ten minutes finding funny stuff on YouTube than wasting your money on this."
4,Great but won't open small pull top pet food cans,It took me a while to get good at using this can opener but I've got it down now. The description makes it sound as if using the tiny pliars to pull the lid off the can is optional but I find it is actually the ONLY way to remove the lid once it has been cut with the opener. My only complaint is that it will not work on the small sized pet food cans that have the pull top lids (like Fancy Feast) and that disappoints me because the pull top lids are the worst as far as cutting yourself - the can and the lid are both razor sharp so I would way rather be able to use the opener on this type of can. If it did work on these cans I would have given five stars.
2,Not worth the price,"Thought for twenty bucks you'd get something really great, dissapointed. It opens cans OK, but no better than the old fashioned openers. I liked the idea of not having the dirty can top in the food. The smooth edge is nice, but it uncovers some new crud that is withing the top can seem. You now have to be carefull this scum doesn't fall in the food."
5,Really easy to use,I'm a fan of Oxo products. They're all well built and just work. The nice thing about this is you don't have to squeeze hard for it to work. Wifey likes this - she's got small hands and isn't the strongest person around. She can use this with ease on canned goods. And you don't have to worry about any sharp edges.
3,"It works just ""ok""","It takes some balancing to line up the cutter on the can, the crank might be tough for individuals with strength issues with their hands. It is hit and miss. Some cans open easily; some take two turns. It depends on how much adhesive was used by the manufacturer of the can. These ""smooth edge"" openers are gauged to work better with ""thinner"" cans. And none of them ever last for very long."
4,It works,I bought this can opener for my older brother.He is extremely happy and grateful for the gift!He is recommending it
5,We're on our second one in 10 years...,I think we bought one of these about 10 years ago and it finally wore out. We'd have to make several revolutions around the can to get it to cut the lid. I ordered another from Amazon and it's working perfectly and will probably do so for 10 years and then I'll buy another one.
5,So far this is a Perfect Product,We have had various hand openers in the past but none that seem to work as well as this one!It is slik..Works easily and seems to be quite foolproof. Need a hand held opener. You can't go wrong with this one!..
5,Easy for people with difficult hands!,This is the first hand held can opener that my husband can use with ease! He raves over it!This is a great gift for someone with arthritis or other hand problems!Super buy!
2,Great Product - Doesn't Last,"This is a really amazing product. It works so well. But after a while it no longer opens a can. Takes many turns around the can to open... and then leaves areas not open so you have to pry open the can. I would expect a product of such apparently quality (and price) to last longer. After buying this, we threw away all our other can openers because this one is so much better. Now we regret that. Unless they figure out how to make it more durable, this product will die. I have contacted OXO to see what they will do. Their web site says 100% Customer Satisfaction."
2,not durable -- doesn't work well on very small cans like tomato paste.,"Am I asking for too much? I love the safe edge concept and was happy for a while. Bought it a couple of years ago -- If I pay $20 or so for a can opener I expect it to last until I don't remember buying it. Like my microplane graters which are going strong after 10 years... On this one, the cutting blade fell off, and for the last six months or so, the opener had been skipping or not cutting through without two passes. Will try the zyliss version this time for a replacement."
3,Good At First,"This can opener was very nice to have the first couple of years. No more sharp edges. But, two years later, it is ready for the trash can. It now leaves those tiny metal shards around the edges of the can. I even got one stuck in my finger-I certainly don't want any stuck in my mouth (or in my family's). Even when the can opener was operating properly, sometimes you still needed to go around the can a few times to finally break the seal. That was annoying, but tolerable in comparison to having a sharp edge to deal with.Time to go can opener shopping again."
2,Little metal slivers,True this can opener is easy to turn but I have found that it often doesn't work on the first time around the can. It also leaves little metal slivers (that I have had to pull out of my fingers)if you try to take the top of the can off with your hands. I may just have a defective version but I contacted customer service and never heard back. My sister hates hers for the same reason. Also when I drain tuna or something I like to do that by using the lid and pushing in to get the juices out and you can't do that with the way this one opens cans.
1,"Metal shards, always fun!","This was a major can-opening fail.I bought this can opener to replace an old one that stopped working. Surely, I thought, I'd be able to open my darn cans again! But no. This can opener worked well for a very, very brief period - maybe a month? Once it went downhill, it went there fast. First, it stopped cutting through the can and the glue around the can, meaning I had to go around and around to get the can open. Then, it started leaving a few little shards of metal sticking up from the can once the can was open. The day I finally threw it away, it left a large number of shards and bits of metal all over the top of the can, the opener, and the counter.This can opener is really pretty expensive, which means I'm extra cranky that it worked so poorly. I will grant that it is in fact quite comfortable to hold and the handle is easy to grip! But that's not worth much when it doesn't actually open cans."
2,in the trash after one year,Does not cut consistently through the can. Often requires several rotations to open can. Replacing with another can opener after one year.
4,Really great tool,"I bought this to replace my Pampered Chef can opener because the plastic handle broke, leaving only the metal frame. I'm used to the 'vertical' type can openers and have tried the 'horizontal' variety like this Oxo before, but to my dissappointment. I found them difficult to use. I bought the Oxo because I like the brand in general and read some good reviews about this product. It works great. My only problem, and perhaps it will resolve itself, is that I find it difficult to intially place the canopener on the can, and also I don't know when I'm done cutting - there's no change in feeling or no noise when you go all the way around the can. I'm still reccommending it though."
3,Only works on some cans,This can opener makes nice clean cuts on some wide cans without any jagged edges. But I have a lot of other cans that it won't open like my stock of Edens Organic Beans. I turn to a cheap model for that.
3,1st Disappointment with OXO,"It took a little while for me to figure out how to use this product. When I finally set it on the can and started to feel some resistance I didn't even realize I was opening the can. You have to actually ""pry"" the can top off. While it works ok for normal every day size cans, I busted every knuckle I have when I started opening up the large club or bulk size cans. The instead of moderate resistance, I found I had to practically force the crank to get the blade to cut through the lip on the larger cans. Because the lip is thicker on the large cans, I had to go around twice in some cases. I have always loved Good Grips and was so thrilled to move up from my less expensive, trusty original Good Grips $10 can opener. My recommendation? Just buy the cheaper one and save your knuckles. Between the hassle of a harder crank and the difficulty of use - it just isn't worth the trouble."
3,It's O.K.,Difficult to get to work. Hard to hold onto and turn and the same time. Would not buy again ever.
2,doesn't work on some cans,"My husband (a 14 year chef) and I both hate this can opener! It is awkward to use and friends helping me cook always have a hard time with it. Worst of all there are some cans we run across on a regular basis that it just does not work on! Looks pretty and sturdy, that's about all it has going for it."
3,Not what I had hoped....,"I loved this can opener at first. It is not hard to turn, and there is a clean edge. No worries about the ""ick"" on top of the can. This means you don't need to wash the opener and it doesn't rust. Love that part!BUT, it has been only 6 months, and it now does not work properly. I have to take 2 trips around the can to get it open.Still better than the original hand crank opener, but not as good as I initially thought."
2,Doesn't Last,"I agree with other reviewers of this product. It works wonderfully for a time, maybe a year, maybe more or less depending on how many cans you open. Then it will begin to only open cans partially. Then it will barely open any part of the can. We are at that point now.We just bought an old fashioned can opener that I know will work forever. Bummer. I liked the lids with no sharp edges."
4,Finishing Techniques,"The most beautiful knit fabric will make an awful sweater if the finishing techniques are not right. There is so much information to help make that perfect project in this small book. Only 144 pages, but they are packed with information. The books starts with Nancie's Finishing Secrets, 7 tips that only experience can teach.There are variety of cast-on methods, seven in all, and five bind-off methods. Also, increases, decreases and selvages. There are even eleven seam stitches explained! There are nice diagrams, photographs, or both for each of the techniques.Also covered is picking up stitches, borders, bands, finishes, which includes crochet edges, and so much more.This is a hard cover book with a heavy spiral binding. It has a lay-flat design for easy use so you will never lose your place.Two worksheets finish the book for planning the next project. This is a very nice reference book for hand knitters."
5,It's The Ultimate Pink Floyd Set.,"Though missing a few of their great recordings, Shine On is the ultimate Pink Floyd collection. If you averaged 13 dollars for a CD, buying this boxed set from Amazon.com is a reasonable price. It even comes with a book that isn't too lame. The Cd cases are interesting with the pyramid and all, but I personally like the song names and numbers on the case when I listen to it to know where the songs are. Having to take out the book just isn't very convenient. Despite it flaws, I beleive it is well worth the money. It quickly adds 8 albums to your Pink Floyd collection. If you are a Pink Floyd fan, get this boxed set before the price goes up."
5,Great music. Especially for starters.,"I got this box set when I first started listening to Pink Floyd. It is full of great music, especially the Early Singles. It is perfect if you are just starting your collection, because you get 8 albums all at once. And they are all grade A. Then you can get the rest as you go along."
3,good to have---okay to hold,"We find Raymond in a distinct place; neither as hilariously bad as he began, nor as astoundingly good as he became. I've been singing the Lard Lord's praises for almost a decade now, and buy this album used for your 'I love this guy' collection, but don't expect anything especially new, or even imitable."
4,Some of their best,"""Stripped,"" ""Enjoy the Silence,"" ""A Question of Time,"" ""It's No Good,"" ""Barrel of a Gun,"" and ""Policy of Truth"" are the best songs here, but this whole compilation of DM's singles since 1986's ""Black Celebration"" is a good collection for anybody not willing to buy the separate albums (god forbid). Most of DM's best is here, so what is really the problem. It is a great collection."
3,Violator still the best,"I bought Violator years ago and like it really well, so I decided to explore more Depeche Mode. Unfortunately, I didn't particularly like any of the stuff that wasn't from Violator. I guess I just got lucky with that one, since 4 of the songs from it are on the Singles 86-98 CD. That leaves me with 2 Depeche Mode albums and that's enough for me unless I can sell the Singles CD."
3,"If you're thinking of buying this, don't, get ""101"" instead.","This only applies to people who are new to DM. If you're looking for a quick DM fix because your musical taste is finally catching up to the know, then buy 101, Ultra and Violator before you buy this. Then get Music for the Masses, Songs of Faith... and work your ways backwards. Trust me."
5,Try to imagine life without Depeche Mode! AAAAAAAARRRGGGHH!,"This was my first exposure into Depeche Mode aside from occasionally hearing 'Enjoy the Silence' on the radio. I got this as a bargain from a pawnshop a year ago and was instantly addicted. I am at the end of my teenage years and my younger brother and girlfriend just didn't understand my DM addiction at first, but now, they are sorry they missed the recent concert because I have converted them. Reluctantly at first, I set out on an expensive campaign to get all of their material. I am extremely impressed by everything they have done. Tis cd is Depeche Mode for starters, because you will start your collection here! This cd includes better than original mixes of some of their best hits! The new transformations of 'Strangelove', 'In Your Room', and 'Useless', are by far much better! This is a must have!!!"
4,Good Stuff!,"I bought this pole for my 12 year old son so that we can go paddle fishing together, I would recommend this to anyone, it lasted through a season with a 12 year old, enough said..."
1,Mellancamps latest is truly dissapointing.,"From the heartless starting track of Fruit trader all the way to the goofy name of ""Chance Meeting of the Tarantula"", JM strikes out. Instead of this album, check out Neil Young or Eagle Eye Cherry for real good sound. The only good track here is the hit single, ""your life is now""."
5,good,my new smell. has a very unique blend of flavors that 2/3 sprays keeps around all day. thanks a lot
5,Makes life easier..lol,"This one would really save you time, trying to pour soap or oil to a cruet or soap dispenser with a small mouth takes forever and not to forget the mess it makes. These funnels make it so much easier. I use one for my oils and the other for soaps."
3,Good grips 3 piece funnel and strainer,Item arrived quickly and was what I ordered. It was new. I would not recommend this funnel and strainer to anyone. It is just a gimmick and not very useful or practical.
4,Great,This is a sturdy plastic funnel with a removable strainer. I bought it to make homemade limoncello. It shipped quickly and was as advertised.
5,It's a Nice Funnel,"Not really that much to rave about, it's a funnel. As funnels go, it's among the best I've seen. I am pleased I purchased this product, it stands up the the quality of the rest of the OXO GOOD GRIPS line.The little strainer insert is pretty worthless, it is hard to ""lock"" in place and usually pops out. Both funnels are conviniently sized and I use them both without problem. The soft rubber ""gripper"" ribs on the side are nice, but I dont know if I'd miss them if they werent there.If you get these with free shipping, I recomend them without hesitation. If you have to pay shipping on top of the purchase price I would recomend buying some of the cheap plastic ($1.99) automotive funnels instead, you probably wont notice any functional difference. The OXO are just nicer looking and a little easier to store as they nest together when stacked."
3,"Great Shoe, But Slightly USED! BEWARE OF SHOES.COM!!","The shoe is great. Fits like a glove. It is very comfortable. However, these shoes arrived in the box scratched in numerous places. These shoes must have been either returned or a display model. Very impressed with the shoe. Very disappointed with [...]. I HOPE AMAZON TAKES NOTE OF THIS MESSAGE."
2,Too flexible,"I know it sounds ridiculous, but this turner is so flexible, it is virtually impossible to lift anything with it. Even the weight of a cookie is too much for it. It can work OK if you can get at the food from the side and balance the weight in the middle, but that is not always easy. It is only $6.99, but I wish I had saved it."
5,Alvin is magic,"This is fantastic live album containing the best recorded version of ""I'm going home"" that is out. Old classics from his Ten Years After days and great new stuff, especially from his 1994 CD, which is the BEST CD out since 1994.So great to hear him with a excellent backup band instead of the old Ten Years After backup guys. It just brings new life to Alvin to have him play with some flexible, inspired musicians backing him up. Check this out and 1994, Zoom, The Alvin Lee Anthology and Pure Blues for starters.You got to hear his little classical ditty, he can play anything and everything.It is so cool to hear the master not limited by mediocre musicians anymore, like in Ten Years After."
4,Good CD!!!,"I thought this CD was good if you like more punk. It was definitely not as ska-ish as LTJ's previous CDs, which i like a lot more, but it was still a really good CD. Its not close to Losing Streak or Pezcore, but i still really enjoyed listening to it. SKANK ON!!!!!!!"
5,RAD,PROBLY ONE OF LTJ BEST CD'S I OWN IF U INTO THIS CD I RECOMMEND THAT U BUY THER CD PEZ COREIF UR INTO SKA AND PUNK FEEL FREE TO EMAIL ME AT SKAGRL90@AOL.COM
3,Nothing Special Here...,"Less Than Jake is a good band that has some awesome songs, However, it's impossible to listen to any of their albums all the way through because the vocals just get too annoying. Hello Rockview is a decent CD, with some great songs, but it ain't a classic. If you're into ska/punk it can't hurt to buy this CD, but there are a lot of bands out there that are better than Less Than Jake."
1,"Cute, but...","Really liked the Mobiblue 1500 cube at first - great sound, easy to use. But found there is a serious design flaw in the product within the first month - the plug for the earphones is on the top of the cube. When working out, a little sweat got in the unit and fried it. Completely unusable. To make matters worse, the support for Mobiblue was HORRIBLE! They took over a month to initially reply to my e-mails for help (there is no support line number to call), only to tell me what I had already read and tried from their on-line materials.If you want to use the MP3 player just for internal use, it's OK. But don't even think about it if you're looking to use it while walking, jogging, mowing the yard, etc. And don't even think you'll get any help if you contact their support group!"
1,The best Two Weeks You'll Ever Have,"This mp3 gets 5 stars for innovation, feature quality and sound but when it comes to reliability and quality it gets a Zero. Over the past 3 months I've bought and returned four of the 1 gig cubes. Each cube lasted exactly 2 weeks before the flash drive froze-up, the cube unable to boot past the logo screen. The last mobiblu I bought went directly from its box to my counter where it charged and then sat unused, and untouched. After two weeks of isolation I noticed the cube had turned on by itself and the logo screen had fozen-up yet again. Spooky but true. I tried resetting the cube but to no avail, it wouldn't boot. I truly liked this player and wanted to give it a fair chance to redeem itself, hence the 4 rebuys. But for all the pampering I gave it the mobiblu just wasn't made for the long haul. Once you get past the unique cuteness factor it revels itself to be just a $130 piece of junk."
2,Bad speaker,Very disappointed. This was my son's 13th birthday present. After about 1 week the left speaker quit working.
1,Filler ingredients not disclosed.,"This product has several filler ingredients not disclosed on the amazon page. These fillers are meant for ease of filling capsules by high speed machines( lubrication,etc,..) I don't like the accumulation of such additives in one's body. I specifically got this brand because of the absence of these chemicals as shown online; however this wasn't the case when I actually received the bottle. Please be accurate about what's in your product."
1,Fascinating - In A Car Wreck Sort Of Way,"This third-rate Maclolm McLaren rip-off band is perversely fascinating in a car-wreck sort of way. Somebody obviously heard Duck Rock and thought ""I can do that!"" Perhaps, but they didn't have Trevor Horn producing, did they? You'd be hard-pressed to listen to more than 2 of these songs in a row but the jaw-dropping ""John Wayne Is Big Leggy"" is the rare example of a song so bad, its good! Though I'd rather have a gun in my mouth than hear the extended version of that song ever again in my life, the short version is perversely compelling listening. Once heard, it will never be forgotten, I assure you. It just doesn't sound like anything a sane person would imagine existing. I'll admit, I own the 7"" single of it. But considering someone having to listen to the previous 8 tracks before they are ""rewarded"" with that song is just a step above Guantanamo treatment. One could imagine only Dick Cheney getting off on this album - as an instrument of torture!"
3,What is this all about?,"Allan Holdsworth is an extraordinary guitarist who plays extraordinarily boring music. The only composition on this compilation that make any senseis ""How deep is the ocean""."
4,It'll keep yo' head ringin'!!,Buy It! The reviews are pretty on it... It's a smoothe mix of funk and reggae with some pretty involved instrumentals...In my opinion: You'll lose yo' head!
5,well worth the money!,"I'd never really heard anything by these guys before I bought the CD, but once I listened to the whole thing, I loved it. If you listen to the Chemical Brothers, you will probably like this. I know I do."
4,mobiBLU Cube DAH-1500i 512 MB Digital Audio Player Silver,mobiBLU Cube DAH-1500i 512 MB Digital Audio Player Silver - Excellent. Met or exceeded all product specifications or expectations. Extremely satisfied.
2,Read the reviews instead - the book's not much longer,"Having looked forward to reading this book, I was rather disappointed. There's not much more to Spurling's brief story than what you'll gather from reading the editorial and/or customer reviews. In my opinion, it could all have been covered in her Matisse book, if not in a footnote, then in a two or three page appendix. If you continue to be curious, I'd recommend trying the public library before spending your money here."
5,Pyramid winner,"The game the $25,000 Pyramid arrived in perfect time. It was obviously an original, not a copy. It was only missing the hourglass timer, which is easily replaced. It brings back fond memories and will be used for years to come."
4,Pretty. Wish the clip was bigger.,"Franc Luxe has some lovely things, and the quality is very good. Way overpriced, but it's hard to find nice barrettes without rhinestones all over them, plus, this was a birthday splurge. I'd say my only complaint is that this is supposed to be one of their barrettes for thick hair, but it's a tight fit for me, and I don't think I have anything more than standard thick hair."
3,Good summer read.,"I felt this book was unique in it's story telling but the characters were a little hard to feel for. This book is not in the same league as ""Here on Earth"". Read it for fun but don't expect too much!"
3,Depressing Read,"I love Alice Hoffman and consider her a wonderful writer. I found Local Girls extremely depressing. Because of her skill as a writer, Hoffman creates a very real picture of a teenage girl who loses everyone. Not that I believe all books should have a happy ending, but I found Local Girls more depressing than necessary."
5,This Should Have Been A Full Novel,"Alice Hoffman proves (yet again) what a wonderful storyteller she is. Her novels are so full of power, plot, setting, movement and all the truly wonderful things that make a great book. ""Local Girls"" is a selection of closely woven short stories about four main characters. The stories are told threw the eyes of young Gretel who you just dearly love. You almost feel cheated that this is a full force novel. The characters that Hoffman created certainly have the power to have carried it. I found myself wanting more and more from each of them. I wanted to see the full arch of the story. But, it certainly didn't distract from how much I enjoyed this selection of stories. I found the struggle of older brother's rise and fall from success especially heartbreaking and readable.With each book Alice Hoffman shows her talent for any subject matter. I find her very talented and very entertaining. I love her stuff."
4,Wonder in ordinary lives,"Local Girls, Alice HoffmanA sad piece. There is Gretel, who tells the story, Jason her brother, Franny their divorced mother, and cousin Margot, and a few friends. There is illness, death, lives ruined and/or wasted. With every quick turn of the page you'll be fairly shouting, NO! Don't do that, do this! As always, Hoffman flashes us some hope: healthy children born to perhaps a more hopeful existence, and Gretel's great escape. Not a book to read if you are in a low mood already. Still, the writing is brilliant."
3,Galician Dictionary,"This dictionary is more of a large glossary than a dictionary in the proper sense. It is good for having a long list of vocabulary words in gallego, but it gives nothing beyond that. Most entries have only one word as the translation and there is little to nothing in the way of multiple meanings, grammatical/ colloquial uses or verb conjugations."
1,Pieces don't stay together,"I bought three of these and all of them fell apart within a week. The wood split on some as well. I bought 4Lixit Guinea Pig Igloo Small Pet Homeand have 4Lixit Critter Space Podand these work great instead. If you are looking for something natural and not plastic maybe you can figure out a way to keep these together. The wood is the only positive thing I can think of about them, although I believe they are made of pine which seems weird because we are not supposed to use pine or cedar bedding for our rats so why pine homes? I know a rat breeder who loves these and that's why I got them, but I was not happy with them at all."
2,Too small,"My Apollo is a little bit bigger than many chinchillas, but I would still say that this hut is pretty small for a chin to sleep in. I also have concerns about the safety of this product, but my chin hasn't really chewed on it. He enjoys sitting on it and somehow squeezing in through the door. I typically use it as a place to put his hay."
1,dont buy it.,The chinchilla hut is tiny. Way too small even for small chinchillas. The size is perfect for rats. There is no bottom piece and the only thing useful for chinchillas is that they can chew on it. My chinchilla is big and poofy and he wont even go in it even though he wants to because he might get stuck. the house doesnt seem like a long lasting product just basic pine wood. Do not buy this house because you will regret it. It is way too small for chinchillas and they might get cramped or break their backs. Order a customized or bigger size house with the same type of wood not this. Not for chinchillas. He cant even go in it.
3,E-Rock : Kliffhanger,"E-Rock's the ""Kliffhanger"" is a 9 track EP. E-Rock represents Oak Cliff (South Dallas). This CD is tight. Some of the tracks that stand out are No Worries, Demniggazdonome, and Kliffhanger.With E-Rock's super tight flow, and great production by GuGu this album is a must for any music listener who can't get enough of that down south flava.Also, check out his latest release entitled ""Southern Eclipse""."
1,johnston solo or nothin',"As a devote Johnston follower I have found that none of the CD records he has released compare to the Stress Record tapes he made thru out the 80's.It seems that whenever Daniel has a band behind him his material just sounds plain if not bar bandish. For the true beautiful agony and despair of his talent search for the Stress record tapes. In particular, ""The What of Whom"" tape/album will make your heart implode. These tapes are usually just Johnston playing piano or guitar, raw and uncontained by a band. Do yourself a favor."
5,Fantastic and easy read,"This book is fantastic. If you are the type of learner that needs a story, a demonstration to pick up topics, then you want to grab all of this author's books. It only took me one sitting to read and now I've read it three times. I highly recommend this for the seasoned CEO as well as the individual just starting a company and working in his garage by himself. I wish I had all these topics down prior to starting my company."
3,Book Worm,"I feel that everyone has something to gain from reading this book. It's concise, to the point and a quick read. The four disciplines are demonstrated with an easy to follow story. It looks great on paper, I can't wait until I get to put what I have learnt fron this book to practise. At this point in time, I am a bit sceptical, that these 4 extremely simple disciplines when practised consistently and diligently, can really work. I almost believe it. I want to believe it. Experience, will tel you that great things can be ahceived by teams that are aligned to the same purpose and goals."
4,Good solid Lencioni,"Liked the book - I had read ""5 dysfunctions of a Team"" first and saw the seeds of 5 dysfunctions in this book. I really like Lencioni's style of using the fable to introduce the material. It is engaging. I pastor a country church in Nebraska, and simply put, a lot of my farmers who are in leadership are intimidated by books and reading in general. Lencioni captures and engages them while introducing them to key concepts they can relate to. Good book as a complement to 5 Dysfunctions."
4,"Eerie basslines, apocalyptic wordplay","Mood's debut offering is a crafted mixture of deeply melodic beats with conscious uplifting rhymes which complement each other. Issues range from the new world order (""peddlers of doom"") to their hometown (""Cincinatti"") to their stagnant views on hiphop (""industry lies"") to various definitions of God (""peace infinity"", ""millenium""). DJ Hi-Tek does an excellent job on this album, and deserves recognition among hiphop heads, as a member of the ever decreasing group of dj's that offer pure unadulated beats virtually free of samples. My choice cuts on the album are ""millenium"", ""karma"", ""info for the streets"", ""the vision"", ""secrets of the sands"" and ""illuminated sunlight"" with sunz of man. Overall, this album is designed for heads who can appreciate well thought out philosophical rhymes with engaging consistent beats."
3,Small problem,First the good news: The finish is great. Love it. Size is perfect.Now the bad news: Put the organizer on my frig. and it was there 3 days and crash! The magnet on the back comes apart where it was attached (glued) to the organizer! I got out my superglue and glued the magnet back on the organizer and it's been doing just fine with no further failures. Maybe the manufacturer needs to upgrade the adhesive or re-train the applicator?
5,Mundial are excellent.,"I love Mundial products. They are always high quality and will never let you down. If you treat them properly, they will last a lifetime. You should feel very confident when buying Mundial knives."
4,great study,"He worked very hard to approach a difficult subject and made it very understandable. I may not agree with it all, but his explanations are fruitful."
4,San Francisco 90's Ambient Scene Document,"This is an interesting document from the early-mid nineties San Francisco Ambient Electronica scene. It contains Silent Records'owner Kim Cascone's Heavenly Music Corporation, Post New Age Proto Pre-paganist Spritual Alchemist and Intellect Richard Sun of ATOI and Embryonic Particle Evocation which was a production by KPFA Engineer Yarrow Sweningson, film special effects legend Chris Halsteàd and Justin Beck of the current underground electronica group BioUtopia. A weird and subtle jem of a CD that would prepare your pychology for an extraterrestrial encounter."
3,Limited Success,"I purchased this fairing in the hope of reducing|eliminating the loud whistle generated by putting a kayak in my Thule Helluvator. I had hoped that the fairing would redirect the airflow and affect the noise. No dice. The fairing had absolutely no impact and I still need to put something between the hull of the boat and the Helluvator cradle. We have noticed no reduction in noise when the system is not loaded. On the other hand, the fairing does look better than the cross-bars alone."
1,"Missing parts, item unusable","The item arrived with missing parts, the passenger's side wing was missing, and instead came with duplicated driver's side wings. The item can't be install in these condition. Will be ordering the missing part from the thule website (appears to be the best option). Really frustrating experience."
4,Solid workout,"I've been a fan of Kathy's for many years, so I was pleasantly surprised to see this video. I admire the fact that she keeps creating new videos for each stage of her life. As she gets older, she thinks about the fitness needs of an aging population.At the same time, however, I do think that she forgets that she's above most others her own age (and even younger) in the fitness department. Some of the moves may be difficult if you have bad backs and knees. Normally she's better at offering modifiers. I did like the fact that the workouts are broken up into 20 minute segments. It's a handy disk that will fit in nicely with your overall workout schedule."
3,Fair Video,"I received this as a Christmas present- I am also using Kathy Smith's Lift Weights to Lose Weight. I would caution anyone new to lifting weights to review the video first. My copy has a production error at the beginning with the dumb bell row- only the right side of the body is targeted and the pace of the video doesn't allow the user to sneak in the missing side. I don't know who does the quality assurance for Ms. Smith's videos but unfortunately this is not the first time I have had missing segments. Overall it is fast paced, will ramp up a calorie burn and I love working out with weights."
3,I might not be the target audience.,"I might not be the target audience for this one, but my mother certainly is. I picked it up because I'm a relatively in-shape guy, and my mom is well...not so much. She needs a little motivation to get up and move, and so I figured I could do this with her once or twice to get her started on the path to exercise.And like I said, I'm not the target audience. My mother is, and both of us, after doing the 60 minute exercise agreed: it's pretty easy. Dumbell curls, some basic pilates, lunges, and about 20 minutes of stretching. That's it. A 58-year-old woman who's only real workout during the day is walking to and from her car seems to think this is pretty basic. I think it's telling."
3,Didn't connect with Kathy,"I've done a lot of workout videos; some of my favorites are anything with Ellen Barrett because she's very charismatic and I love the workouts she puts together. I've also been doing the P90x videos and I like those as well. There have been plenty of workout videos I don't care for enough to do again and this falls in with those. I didn't love the exercises and I just didn't connect with the instructor.On the positive this workout was a bit more difficult than I expected; not P90x difficult but more than I thought it would be since it's advertised to older women. However, I just found the exercises to be boring. Nothing made me want to put this video back in when I was finished, especially having a large library of workout that I really enjoy."
3,You missed one...,"Of course the greatest hits has ""I Wanna Rock"" and ""We're Not Gonna Take It"", the two most popular songs. But how could they ignore ""Burn In Hell"" which was featured in the movie Pee Wee's Big Adventure? You can't ignore the ""pop rock"" songs no matter how bubble gum they may sound to hard rock fans."
2,Only for the brain damaged,"Hey,dude,you're 35 years old,5'6,285,balding,still live with mom and dad,and love Twisted Sister!Rock on my man!Love that haircut from SuperCuts."
2,No. LISTEN to the critics.,"This is your average Scyfy movie. No better, no worse. Judge for yourself. My own opinion is it is a subpar man in a rubber suit horror movie were the climax happened offscreen. It also has a kind of wussy monster since over a minute of slow motion pummeling didn't really affect the hero. You do get a little sleepy lesbian action but this movie really is nothing special. This review is also of the movie. I hope the DVD offers something else of interest to warrant a purchase (like deleted scenes, alternate scenes, ""How the heck we were able to get Sid Haig mini-feature, etc.)"
2,Bad plot,They really ruined this movie with a bad plot. Its hard to follow. So one of the kids is related to the weird swamp people? And one of the girls was his sister? And she gave him a lil somethin somethin? This movie would have been better off by just sticking to a much simpler storyline. It had some potential. The main actor was honestly not half bad. Everyone else besides Sid Haig were complete trash.
4,"Modern ""Prisoner""","Great show, blending sci-fi, horror, mystery, and drama. I like Nowhere Man for the same reason that I love The Prisoner, as both shows deal with oppressive forces at work in modern-day civilization. But where The Prisoner focuses on deliberate, thought-provoking, and highly symbolic social commentary, Nowhere Man focuses on entertainment. That makes The Prisoner edgier and more experimental (and better, to fringe viewers like me), but it also makes Nowhere Man far more approachable to a mainstream audience.Be seeing you."
1,Christian?,"I cannot imagine anything more fanciful than someone believing that the Simpson's in any way is a positive thing. This book is either a satire on the religiocity of the series or is a sorry work for something that is supposed to be Christian. This is not a book that can please God. For anyone who is Christian to find ""Christ Dyed Eggs For Our Sins"" funny is beyond belief and underscores the real problem in our Christian culture."
4,An amusing look at contemporary theology,I have enjoyed this book and ordered the companion Leader's Guide for Group Study. I am using this book along with the leader's guide with a church youth group. The idea that theology can be found in contemporary entertainment is a breath of fresh air to our teenagers.
4,Simplicity at its best,I remember these key rings from my childhood and I'm glad I found out they still make them. These are about as simple and light as a keyring can get. A half twist opens it up so you can add or remove keys yet the cable is rigid enough that it's highly unlikely it will come open on its own. Some have complained that you can't fit a lot of keys on this version and still be able to open and close it. I can see how that can happen. You have to have enough space to twist it so if it's more than 1/2 full you'll have a hard time. If you don't need to fill it up with keys I'd say this version might be better. I haven't tried the version that screws closed but my guess is that it's more likely to accidentally losen and come open.
1,Good concept but truly a piece of .......,"Whoever assembled mine botched it. The internal mechanism does not lock in a figure 8, but only about 10 degrees in so it does not stay locked....."
1,Are you kidding me???,"You have to twist the key ring into an 8 shape in order to open and close it - this doesn't leave much room for your keys!!! It is a cool way of opening and closing, but completely lacks functionality for the purpose you would guess it was designed for - holding keys. Paid $1.98 for product and $4.50 for shipping - what a waste of time and money."
1,Won't function,First I didn't receive this contacted the seller and they sent one out. I can't get this to open up it's a hassle to use. Not going to send it back though that's a hassle too. I'll just chalk up the loss of a couple of bucks.
3,"Great Start, Flat Ending","I must say that this book had a terrific kick-start and was moving and grooving throughout the middle. But, the ending seems way too rushed and just left me flat. A lot more could've been explored and explained at the end but it seemed like the author might've been coming up on her deadline and just ended it, leaving a bad taste in my mouth."
5,Fascinating and Terrifying,"As a fan of medical mysteries, adventures, and horrors, I find none as terrifying as those based on fact. Richard Preston came through again with one of the most fascinating and thought provoking books I have read in a long time. I was not sure what to expect, as I had bought the book some time ago. When it started with a revisit of 9/11 and the anthrax scare, I was fairly disappointed, as I was looking for something along the lines of Ebola or the other hemmoragic fevers. However, the book quickly did a history of the team charged with erradicating smallpox, their trials, triumphs, and I was just blown away. Call me odd for being fascinated by smallpox, and other books of this sort, but when one realizes that these diseases occurred, real people died, and real people sought and sometimes found a cure, nothing can make for more interesting reading. I recommend all Preston and Preston/Child collaborations as 'intelligent' reading."
5,You'll lose sleep if you read this,"If you wonder why rogue states with bio-war programs must be subdued, this book provides an answer. It begins as a fascinating, frightening history of smallpox - and ends by clearly delineating the threat of smallpox, anthrax and other biological weapons in our modern world.The ultimate threat of the combination of state weapon development and terrorist groups is driven home with stunning clarity. The threat described is one that must be destroyed at practically any cost if we are to live with a modicum of safety.Jerry"
3,not bad,"After reading the Hot Zone by Richard Preston I looked forward to getting my hands on Demon in the Freezer. While the book was not bad (it kept me interested enough to read it all the way through anyway), it wasn't as interesting to me as the Hot Zone was. This is peculiar because I generally find smallpox related stories to be fascinating, and there are a lot of good books available on smallpox. Perhaps I started this book with expectations that were too high, based on Preston's excellent work in writing the Hot Zone. Demon in the Freezer is not bad, but nothing really special either. I'd recommend it to those who like the genre and have run out of other titles to check out, but don't expect it to keep you on the edge of your seat."
3,Prototype debut,"Ushering in their fuzzed up alt/psych sound that would singularly define them, this is more of a distillation in their sleazy yet gorgeous, simple but elegant, style of that cooool rock then anything else they have worked on. This is the unadulterated foundation to which all their sucessive albums further experimented on, and for better and worse the album succeeds on those merits. Packing the largest direct punch from the bands most earnest delivery, songs do also tend to wear thin when they drone in the wrong areas. While their sound is based in repetition, and in particular the drone of the deep distorted electric guitar, the band only can accentuate that vibe about half the time that they try here. Other tracks that try harder at uptempo rocking detracts the band from finding their groove."
5,"A classic, and the next step from Kyuss","Kyuss dies and QOTSA was born. This was the album that started QOTSA up, and really halped to popularize the stoner rock genre. Up until then, for me at least, it was Kyuss, Nebula, and Fu Manchu with a nof to Clutch, one of my favorite bands, who kind of skirted the genre a bit. After this album, many, many great efforts came out in the genre from a multitude of bands. So really, if you love stoner rock, or just some straight forward driving music, and you havent heard this album, you need to buy it. A landmark, a classic, and an always welcome listen and addition to any collection.One further note. You know how you cant help but simply feel good listening to something like Steve Miller? This album has that same effect. You cant be upset jamming this. The music simply wont let you.Enjoy!"
4,a more mature desert rock,"the very first thing that grabs you from the opening track is that warm familiar guitar tone.yes people,josh hommes,(ex-kyuss),is back,and it's about time.still giving us great music,but with a little more maturity.the songs are shorter,but still as powerful as kyuss.josh also decided to sing in his new project,and proves more than capable of doing so.his voice is quite good sometimes sounding like john garcia,(ex-kyuss),and dave grohl of foo fighters fame.still desert rock though a little more psychedelic and a little more etheral in nature.standout tracks that caught my atention were ""avon"",""if only"",""you would know"",and""give the mule what he wants"".these songs are great examples of the eclectic nature of this album.it only gets a 4 rating because its too damn short.i really wanted more,but i hope josh finally gets some recognition of his talents on a grander scale."
2,"So, so",I was a bit disappointed with this. It simply lacked uniqueness. I already have Jazzmatazz albums so really the only other song on here with flavor is Joi. The rest of the records are rather unmemorable.
1,"Forget ""Blair Wich Project""...","...because if you're hoping for an improvement of that movie, ""Altered"" indeed will be a disappointment. All I was Hoping for was thriller of the same atmosphere that was ""Blair Wich"", but seriously now; Is ""Altered"" supposed to be a comedy or what? Whatever you'd call it I found it purely as a waste of time and expectation! Everything looks fake (even the trees in the forest), and I am actually seldom picky about special effects as long as the story functions. This was as far from ""Blair Wich"" as it could get. And I find it hard to believe it has the same director! Watch ""Signs"" once again instead, even ""E.T""!One star because of an unoriginal, predictable (there's no twist at the end here!) and self-ruining script that's become ""ALtered""... Certain scenes even made this turkey a parody of itself. It's actually a bit sad. Look what the filmmakers managed to do without the money."
4,Konus eyepiece,"Entry level telescopes most often have the 0.965"" eyepieces. The other common eyepieces are 1.25"" and 2.0"" sizes. Each offers greater light transfer from the main lens or mirror.This little eyepiece does a fine job on my smallest scope, and nicely replaces an eyepiece that was lost."
3,Fair Classical,"I did not like the mediocre playing of the music. Also, sound did not sound as clear as best digital can"
5,I've loved this family for years!,"The loving, lively Killilea family meant so much to me as a lonely child from a broken home. I would be so interested to find out what has happened to them over the years."
5,stunned,I read the books when I was 11 for the first time and many times after that. My babysitter gave them to me and she went on to become a physical therapist because of them. I just learned about the fire that killed Gloria's and Marie's daughters and can hardly imagine it. I also read one comment that suggested that Big Marie and Gloria were estranged @ the time of Big Marie's death. I hope there was no estrangement in the family but can only imagine what a loss like that would do even among a close family like that.
4,hopefully this will never be needed,This is the type of item that is useful only in very rare circumstances.. With the increased prevelance of electronic windows it now is less feasible to open the windows if the electonics are damaged.. I hope I never need this. I haven't actually used it yet as I like my midows the way they are.
4,Nice Product - I Hope It Is Never Used...,"I bought this for the wife's car (she loves pink anything). It's a bit smaller than I thought it would be, and I was a bit disappointed to find that it doesn't really come with an installation kit. It does come with instructions that recommend you seek a professional to install the device (eye roll).I'll figure out a way to stow it away somewhere.It loses one star for not providing a means of installing the device."
5,A real gem!,"In only 48 pages Clinard documents the power of truly listening and gives simple, precise steps to obtain the skill. This is a complete guide for anyone who wants to improve listening skills. I thought I was a good listener, but this book taught me that I have fallen into some bad habits -- and now I know how to correct them."
3,Combat DVD review-from Amazon,The item was a gift; I'm told one of the disks did not operate properly. I believe it was disk 2.
5,AWESOME!!,"The product is total high quality. The quality of the series, plus the packaging is excellent. Each Season is organized and arranged with names of each episode, special guests highlighted with pictures, and special features listed within each season. WONDERFUL experience for a Combat fan!"
4,"The definitive ""Hefty Tome""","If someone isn't persuaded by the arguments in The Resurrection of the Son of God you can still get your money's worth. Just use the book's 817 pages as a club to beat them into submission.I didn't read the whole thing, my life's just not long enough, and my need for persuasion deep enough. But I did read the introductory chapters and concluding chapters and dipped more or less deeply into the parts in between. Wright's got all his ducks mostly in a row, but in the end, this book is better suited to reconverting your favorite Schillebeeckxian or Liberal Protestant than for converting people in the first place. It is, however, very good for the first. I'll still be recommending G.K. Chesterton's Orthodoxy to them.One thing I didn't see addressed in the book, which would be interesting for Wright to tackle is some of the more modern Jewish messianic movements, like that around the Lubavitcher Rebbe, which, so far, has continued after their leader's death."
3,Incomplete,I received product earlier than expected. Beautiful but one missing salad plate. I contacted Amazon by email twice but did not get a response. I could not locate a telephone number to report problem with order. Very frustrating not able to resolve problem. I am still waiting on a response.
5,EXTRAORDINARIO,"EL CD DE BARBARA HIGUERA ME FASCINO. TIENE VARIEDAD DE CANCIONES, Y ELLA TIENE UNA VOS EXCELENTE. LO RECOMIENDO A TODO MUNDO. SI QUE VALE LA PENA COMPRARLO. GRACIAS, ELISSA TASSIN, MANDEVILLE, LA"
4,"Great easy ready, very good articulation of team work challenges","Great read, I love the story of new CEO taking over her executive team, and working through their dysfunctions, most of which they are completely oblivious to. The book is hard to put down, and that is hard to say for business books. I agree with the author's assesment of how important team work is, and the examples, and conversations and dialogues make it a very good read, with lots of lesson to learn. Highly recommend it."
2,"A leadership fable -- emphasis on the ""fable""","This book is making the rounds at the Silicon Valley company where I work. Last week I was asked to read it by one of our technical leaders. I have a couple of major issues with this book. First, as the title says, it's a ""fable"" -- the people are fictitious, and none of the situations in the book really happened. The author can make up anything he wants to. Second, the author states that the foundation of teamwork is trust. ""Trust"" is defined as being comfortable enough with your fellow team members to be vulnerable with them. The fictitious characters in the book begin to establish trust at an offsite when they reveal events from their childhoods. I guess this could work if we lived in a perfect world where people don't come from dysfunctional families and everyone you work with is trustworthy. That's just not reality. I'm giving this a 2-star rating because it's an entertaining read -- as fiction."
2,Five Team Dysfunctions,Mostly old news. Was hoping for fresh ideas. I would only recommend this book to someone new to being part of a work team.
4,Simple but insightful,Well worth your time and money if you lead teams. You can't help but take away a few ideas to make your team function more effectively.
4,Good read,"The book is formatted in an easy to read style with the Fable first and then followed up with some practical ""How To's"" to implement the changes. My first application of these techniques will be with a non-profit group that I volunteer with.I have long blasted meetings as being a tremendous ""non-value added"" activity at many companies. If not run correctly and efficiently, they truly are a waste of valuable time and can be a morale buster. This book gives some practical direction on how to identify issues with poorly conducted meetings and then address the problems.This is a good read for anyone in a position of leadership within a team setting."
4,The Five Disfunctions of a Team,It's all about TEAM WORK. It shows how disfunctional most companies are.It can be used in any situation. It makes sense all working together for the common good.
3,Five Dysfunctions - Mixed Review - Book GREAT; Amazon Pricing Not So Great,"The book, ""The Five Dysfunctions of a Team,"" is an excellent book in every respect. We've used it with our teams in Sub-Saharan Africa to help them work better together. It's an easy read and relatively easy to make connections between the theory in the book and reality with a team.However, Amazon's pricing seems outrageous. The price for the Kindle edition has gone from $4.49 in September 2011 to $9.99 in December 2011 to $13.72 today! Granted, the $4.49 price was probably a promotion. But even ignoring that price, the current price is almost 50% higher than the price just 5 months ago."
4,Savatage - 'Handful Of Rain' (Atlantic),"Always have felt that Savatage was truly an under appreciated metal band that never did get the recognition they deserved. Have seen them several times. Remember hanging out in a club's parking lot with guitarist Criss Oliva(R.I.P.)after a show trading off Three Stooges lines, calling one another a knucklehead, grape head, etc. This was like a month or so before he was killed in a car crash. Glad to see the group decided to carry on. 'Handful...' debuts the former Testament guitarist Alex Skolnick and he appears to fit in rather well, I thought. The band's recently-new vocalist Zach Stevens seems to do the same. What luck,huh? These guys STILL rock!Good tracks include the guitar ridden ""Taunting Cobras"", ""Nothin' Going On"", the instrumental ""Visions"" and ""Stare Into The Sun"". Wait a minute...what's with all the melodic keyboard playing? I mean, that CAN be a great thing, but in Savatage? Okay,so they're now changing. STILL a decent CD. Long live Savatage!!"
5,summertime and taco salad,"I bought this on sale cheaper than I could buy at the dollar store. And, no tax or shipping. I use a lot of this in the summer for my taco salad.1 Pk of soften cream cheese mixed with 1 Pk of taco seasoning. Spread thin on a large plate and top with lots of lettuce, shredded cheese, finely chopped onions, sliced black olives, and salsa. Serve with taco chips for scooping. It's great for a crowd and is always a hit."
2,Great story; awful writing,"It is incredible that this ever got published. The author cannot write for beans (his prose is a constant irritant) and no editor has ever looked at this thing. The writing gets in the way constantly. If you're interested in the subject, you'll get through the book, but it won't be easy."
4,Light & Soft.,"I like this scent, goes on real soft lasting time ,4-6 hours or more, it is not over powering, with amber and light musk notes, which blends to a soft powdery scent the longer you wear it."
1,???,"I can't say definitely because I am just a student, but this book wont get you far, it is full of Italianism (which may be current in Sicily, but so is Standard Italian) or maybe I began with an archaic dialect and that makes such impression."
4,TRACK LISTING:,You Don't Have to Love Me [LP Version]You Don't Have to Love Me [Instrumental]Nobody's Body [LP Version]Nobody's Body [Instrumental]
4,Hackensack - 'Up The Hardway' (SPM),"Initially put out in 1974, I believe this was the band's only proper release. Basically, just good '70's blues-based rock. Tunes here that I liked best were the title cut ""Up The Hardway"", the seven-minute ""Long Way To Go"" (reminds me of Joe Cocker), ""Angels Theme / Goodbye Badboy"", ""Northern Girl"" and ""Hot Damn Home-Made Wine"". Line-up: Nicke Moore (Samson) - vocals, Ray Smith - guitar, Paul Martinez (Robert Plant) and Simon Fox (Uli Jon Roth, Be Bop Deluxe) - drums. Might appeal to fans of (I'm second guessing here) Ten Years After, John Mayall and Titanic."
2,Pre-trib Propaganda,"Just more pre-trib propaganda. There is not a single verse in the Bible that says the Rapture will be before the Tribulation. In fact Jesus told us the very opposite (read Matthew 24:29-31 very carefully). Revelation 20:4,5 tells us that the saints martyred in the Tribulation will be in the First Resurrection. The First Resurrection is the RAPTURE! The Rapture is obviously after the Tribulation! It's time to wake up and accept the truth. Place your trust in Jesus Christ not in fictional escapism."
1,Grouchy Buyer,"I thought this book would have been a fun-filled, easily understood education in grammar. Instead, it has turned out to be a waste of my time, money and will be useless to me as a teacher. Mr. Parrish's presentation of the subject is done in such a way that one has to read and reread to get what he is attempting to say. This is not a good resource tool for those in search of such..."
1,Save yourself a lot of trouble.,"I ended up sending this pocket pc back five times and I had to replace it twice! The service is poor compared to other companies. The device is extremely fragile and takes up time on easy tasks with the hardware. I would stay away from this company and recommend ""hp."" If you want to buy a good priced Pocket PC that has Wi-Fi and has a high quantity of memory, purchase the hp 1945 Pocket PC. Other then the support from Toshiba, the operating system software (Windows 2003 Pocket PC Edition) is easy to use and gets my jobs done without working at my desk all day long."
3,A gift.,"My wife fell in love with Louie while watching him host Family Feud, so I got her this for Christmas. Combining humor with unflinching honesty, Anderson uses his own troubles and family history to try and understand how best to let go and let wounds heal. Easier said than done, but entertaining reading nonetheless."
3,An Amazing Life,"This biography has information about a woman who stuck by her beliefs about family, slavery, and obligations. She was firm in her beliefs, and truly lived them. Her determination to do the right thing ultimately influenced large numbers of people in this country.(Should be 5 stars )"
2,Shoddy shipping,"The product does what it says...I haven't had a problem with that. However, I got these as a gift, and all I received was an open package of 10 DVD+R discs and 4 cracked cases. I had to keep them for myself, which wasn't a big deal since I use them also, but it wasn't mentioned anywhere that the package would be tore open and the discs would just be thrown in there."
5,The inspiration is most enormous!,"Angle talk is a wonderful diet for a hungry soul it reaches the innermost subconcious of todays generation. It is a very effective ""tool"" for anyone who chooses to improve their spirital life as well as the physical existence. Religous denominations is not stressed."
2,sleeping with ne win,"Wendy Law-Yone is a Chinese/Burmese lady, daughter of a well-known journalist in Burma. This book describes the bizarre and at times brutal and lurid story of a woman in Burma (perhaps it is partially autobiographical!) who circulated in the higher echelons of burmese society in the 60's and 70's, got involved in politics, spent some time in jail and had an affair with the then top guy, the old dictator General Ne Win. I don't know how true the story is or whether it has anything to do with Wendy Law-Yone's own experiences, but it is interesting for me, as a burmese man (who used to read his father's editorials!), to find out what Wendy has to say about Burma. She writes well though (like her dad!). The book is worth the price!"
5,The Show That Really Was Saturday Night!,"I loved watching this show again. Some jokes I remembered verbatim as my friends and I repeated them to each other over and over again (I was in high school). The show was many things - musical, comedy and something other - sketches for contemplation and thought. The cast is perfect - Gilda Radner, John Belushi, Jane Curtain, Garrett Morris, Chevy Chase and Dan Ackroyd. It is impressive that most of the guests felt it was their show also. I found it really meaningful to see this show again and was pleased I received the box set for Christmas. The first 5 years of the show were incredible and not the hit and miss show of later years. Great memories. I also enjoyed watching the Chevy Chase impersonation of Gerald Ford and Dan Ackroyd's Nixon and Jimmy Carter. Watching the election campaign on Saturday Night Live is similar to experiencing it once again in the current election."
5,A Long Time Coming,"I have wated for someone to finally put this type of set together for a long time. I ordered it early this week, and it arrived today. I've not played a disc yet, but am VERY satisfied with the way they packaged it.Simply put, if you are a fan of SNL, especially the early years, order this set now. I've read blogs about bumpers missing, and less than perfect picture quality, and frankly, those don't bother me one bit. I have the complete shows I so enjoyed when they were first broadcast. That is more than enough for me."
2,Pretty slow start,"I guess I never saw the first few episodes. Boy were they lousy (except for an occasional appearance of Chevy Chase). They concentrated more on music than on humor. It's funny how you remember things being funnier in the past, and then you revisit them and...they're no longer funny.Well it got better as the season progressed. Expect it to start out slow and ... well... dumb."
1,Not Worth Your Time or Money,"I remember SNL as a funny show, this stuff is not funny in the least. It must have gotten funnier with season 2, 3 or 4 because season one is horrible. I have not yet been able to watch an entire episode, they are that bad. I was a Freshman in college in 1975 so maybe that had something to do with why I might have thought it was funny then but seriously, don't waster your time or money on the DVD set.Don't waste your money on this set. Mine will be up on eBay very soon."
4,Wonderful,"My dad was so happy. I've NEVER gotten him a Christmas gift he was so enthusiastic about. He's a difficult one to shop for. He watched it quite a bit for the next two days. The only thing I'd say would've improved the product is having a little paper booklet in the case describing which episodes and skits are on each disk. Most ""seasons"" of any series have a booklet."
5,I love powdered Guarana,I started using powdered guarana while I was deployed because I could just stir some into juice instead of trying to find decent coffee. Army coffee is disappointing at its best. It gives me a nice alert feeling without the jittery feeling of normal caffeine. It doesn't disolve into liquid so you need to keep stirring and it has a slight herbal taste so I wouldn't stir into water by itself except as a last resort. I'm going to try putting a spoonful on yogurt and I think that will turn out nicely. I usually use about a half of normal spoonful.If you would like to know something specific about this item just ask and I'll try to respond within a day or so.
3,"Interesting case, not interesting writing.","I had heard about the Marion Parker kidnapping/murder years ago in an old book about L.A. history. It was a short paragraph or two and I hadn't run into anything more about it until I saw this book. Michael Newton, the writer that brought us the disturbing ""Daddy was the Black Dahlia Killer"" is up to his old tricks in this book as well. Too much detail, too little editing in it. The story is worth the read but beware, there are way too many pages of history that matters little (imho) to the crime. Is Mr. Newton trying to explain why this young man would murder a little girl? Perhaps. I didn't buy it though. Anyway, worth a read to those, like myself, who love true crime and early Los Angeles."
1,Very weak,"I wanted to watch some of those propaganda movies from the Cultural Revolution era. That is a very sad chapter in Chinese history, but I wanted to see the propaganda unedited. This DVD is a documentary and contains snippets only. Actually quite useless."
3,"not bad, but not excellent","It is creative and full of imagination, but lacks historical and political depth. Without narration abd related information, how can later generations understand the meaning and background of Yang Ban Xi?"
1,very low quality,"When it arrived, it was full of tangles and hair keeps shedding all over the place. I suppose the cheap price was a bit too good to be true."
4,One of the most underrated albums of our times,"By all accounts, this album should have produced at least three huge singles in ""Love is All Around,"" ""Seeing is Believing,"" and ""Trippin."" But sadly, trends reign supreme in the music business and only a couple of exceptions to the rule can be made, and this year it was Maxwell and Erykah Badu. But Adriana's tunes are far superior to Erykah's, and the production and arrangements here are fresher and smoother than anything currently on the radio. ""Heaven,"" ""Swimming,"" and ""In the Sun"" are standouts and the whole album winningly bridges 70's attitudes about songwriting with a 90's attitude about grooves. If that formula sounds irresistible, there's good enough reason. But since radio and MTV obviously missed the boat, take it upon yourself to discover one of the brightest and well-crafted R&B albums of recent years."
5,Outstanding,"After appearing on Husband ; Dred Scott's 1994 classic ""Check The Vibe"", Adriana Evans finally dropped her long-awaited self-titled debut on Loud Records in 1997. The smooth, fresh & flawless vibes from Adriana against the phenomenally laid-back & refreshing production from Dred Scott (& co producer Rastine Calhoun)results in nothing less than a soul CLASSIC. Adriana has one of the most satisfying voices I have ever heard.This album is ridiculously slept on, by both soul & hiphop fans alike. Stop sleepin' & become enlightened by Adriana Evans' undoubtable talent & Jonathan Scott's unappreciated brilliance on the boards. One of the best albums of 1997, regardless of genre.P.S. Also check out Dred Scott's OOP 1994 Release ""Breakin' Combs""...mid 90's hiphop at its finest. PEACE"
4,"""Bloom"" maintains its quality from start to end","Billy Pilgrim's ""Bloom"" makes my 'short list' of albums I can pop in and let run without need to skip past poor tracks. Most of the album centers on pop-ish, rockabilly tunes with a positve emotional feel. I've owned the album since its debut in 1995 and it's still a favorite choice for long road trips. I can't compare the sound to any bigger-name artists because this album's sound is far simpler than most but still has a unique quality. It's not over-produced but it doesn't have a cheap ""basement studio"" sound, either -- just clear, clean, 'honest' music. This is a -very- enjoyable album that doesn't get old after the fifth (or tenth, or twentieth) listen."
2,for what ??,"The world's most respected pianists do the worst thing i have ever seen . It is not Music , It is just for fun"
1,Not clear specifications,Didn't realize that item could not be played on traditional CD player. Ended up returning.
1,A Disaster,"I bought this product locally and, after the first slice or two was made, I was immediately disappointed. I was slicing meat and the blade did not finish the cut. Instead the slices collected at the base of the machine in the back all connected like paper dolls. There is a space between the blade and the back of the machine that allows whatever you're slicing to fall through. I continued to use it, hoping it would get better or I would catch on to some secret trick. When I took it apart for cleaning - which it does clean up easily - I noticed the casing around the blade had burned or melted or rubbed to where it was noticeably marred. Luckily the store I bought it at let me exchange it for a different type of machine altogether."
2,cant slice jello,I bought this as a gift for my wife. It held up for one maybe two times before we started hearing grinding noises when the blade would stop during slicing. Now after maybe 6 to 8 uses the blade stops as soon as you start to slice anything. It has plastic geared teeth which is the problem. I strongly recommend NOT buying this product.
5,Excellent snack,"My whole family loves the Planters Trail Mix. Great for on the go. In the golfbag, office or in the car."
5,WOW,"I have always been a STYX and DEYOUNG fan, but I was not prepared for this cd. Showtunes, come on, that was my reaction when I heard that was what his new cd was about. But after hearing it, I was amazed. Sure it not your normal music from him, or STYX, but who cares. Dennnis' voice has never sounded better. People have complained about him changing this and that about the songs. Who cares, that's what its all about, your idea on someone else's song. And what he does is fantastic. Someone to Watch Over Me, Memory, On The Street Where You Live, Bring Him Home, and It's in Every One of Us, are some of the greatest songs I've ever heard. And rest of the songs are not far behind, almost makes you forget that Dennis has forgot how to rock."
1,Very disappointed.,"I have purchased these in the past at a local retailer, so I assumed that these would be of the same quality. They were not. After only 1 recording, 3 of the discs have errors and are unrecordable. I have not used the other 2 yet, but will not be ordering again."
4,wow!!,"If you have not yet started reading heartland books , you should start now!!! Even if your not into horses these are still awesome books! Heartland books teach you a lot about horses and about a better way of treating them. This book has a series of events that are very hard on the main character Amy who has just lost her mother in a car acccident. After her father left her mom, sis lou and amy they have looked after his old horse peaguses, but now peaguses is ill! This is a very emotional book! I certainly enjoyed and all the ones in the same series! hope you do too!!!"
5,A complex subject rendered simply and beautifully!,"I have read this book twice this year. The first time - I read it non-stop, captured by the sheer drama of the narrative. The second time - I took the time to savor the potraits Mr. Mattingly crafts so well. He is a master of his subject, and skillfully takes a complex and convoluted event and presents it in a way that is humorous, insightful, captivating and colorful. It is, in my mind, reflective of the highest standards of fine writing - be it historical or not. A thoroughly enjoyable book - this is one book that will be a recurrent read."
1,Lame,"Parker spends way too much time on the ridiculous relationship between Stone and Jenn, and nowhere near enough time on what's supposed to be the actual plot of the book--the murder. Is this a Danielle Steele romance or a murder mystery? It's hard to tell, and the Jenn subplot is ludicrous. And I'm just so sick of Parker's ""grown up"" ways the characters all seem to be so willing to just accept everyone's faults. And why Stone couldn't have just arrested the guy at the end is beyond me. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book."
2,A Laborious task to Read,"In this novel, High Profile, I thought that Mr. Parker had lost his abilities to create a decent story. In the past I considered him an excellent writer and read many of his books, but this novel was such a laborious task for me to finish that I couldn't believe I was reading a story by Mr. Parker.The plot itself was loose, but interesting enough to maintain my interest, but I kept waiting for the story to pull me into it, however that never happened. The characters were weak and not fully developed, although I found Sunny to be an interesting character. I'm glad the novel was given to me my neighbor. If you are a real Parker fan I would guess that you would enjoy this novel, however I was disappointed in it and I expected more from Mr. Parker."
1,Not a good book..,"I'm sorry. I'm a big Parker fan, both of his Spenser series and his Westerns.I read a few early Jesse Stone books and wasn't too impressed, but whnn I saw this at a discount store,I thought I'd give it a try.Not worth it. A salient feature of most good books is that you like or least can empathize with the character. Some character, anyway. But Jesse Stone is just a sucker, a total dope who is admittedly a decent cop. The minimalist dialogue seems draggy because you really don't like Stone the sucker much. Feel sorry for him, yes. Like him, no. Or anyone else in this slow and stupid book. OK, maybe Sonny Randall's dog. But that's not enough.A poor book. Even at a discount.."
2,High Profile,Lots of fun if you are a Parker fan. This Jesse Stone mystery is a light read that is great for the beach or the plane.
1,Juvenile Writing Effort,"I was out of things to listen to on my long commute to work and picked this up in a hurry. Now, I've read quite a few of Parker's other offerings because they usually are quick reads and don't take much concentration to keep on point. But LISTENING to this book was painful. All the dialogue is finished or started with ""he said"" or ""she said."" I don't think I realized it when READING his work, mainly because the eye will skip over those things easily. When I was LISTENING to this, it was like nails scraping on a blackboard. It was so completely annoying that I just couldn't get into the story at all!"
1,WHAT COULD BE WORSE THEN. . .????,This is a test----What could be worse than a really dumbJESSE STONE book??? a JESSE STONE book with SUNNY RANDALLas one of the characters!!! They are both pathetic to theextreme!!! I made it about half-way and started up-chucking!!WHERE IS SPENSER WHEN YOU NEED HIM???
2,"Jesse please get over that low life ex wife , or i am firing you!","This is enough! I love Parker, and i love Jesse Stone.He showed great promise in the beginning of the Stone series.However, i am tired of his hanging on to that low life, cheating, obviously disturbed ex wife. I also found Sunny's relationship with Jenn to be odd. If i had the opp to be with a great guy, no way would i condone the way his ex wife jerks him around. Geez, either add more plot or i am firing you Parker."
4,Typical Jesse Stone,"If you like Jesse Stone, you'll like this book. I like including Sunny Randall and mixing her with Jen. The story line doesn't tax you brain, but it is a quick enjoyable read."
4,silly fun!,"I thought this movie was fun! It is a bit over the top, and sometimes seems as though they are trying too hard to be goofy. But, overall it is a good family comedy!"
5,Sweet and Funny!,Anybody that likes dog stories or movies like Home Alone will like this one. It has a good story line with a sweet lovable dog that is being used to smuggle diamonds when a kid with a big heart steps in to help her and put away the diamond smugglers. Add in another kindred spirit that adds a lending hand and you get a feel good ending.
4,Almost everything you could ask for!,Like i said almost everything.....no ab fab because of red ....I purchased mine in canada but only had one disktoday at hmv i saw a 2 disk set and had the cashier open it and .....ONLY ONE DISK even though it said 2 on the frontWhat is the story dose anyone acually own the 2nd disk and what is on it !Great disk saw them in montreal this is almost as good!
3,Mic G FANS ONLY!!!,"For all fans of MIC G. or someone looking for a new MC, this ones for you. The beats were good and MIC G sounds equivalent to his first attempt. Its not a must have yet its still a great listen."
1,Rusted after first wash!,"These are very cute cutters, but first time I hand washed and air dried...they rusted. Each and every piece.I would recommend going with a better set unless you plan to dry each one by hand and there are some very small areas to get into.I've only used them once, so can't comment on the strength of the welds and overall constructions. However, just based on the rusting, I would not recommend these!"
2,Don't waste your money,"This album is supposed to be a soundtrack/greatest hits. But, look at it this way. If it was a greatest hits, it should have Back in Black, Shoot to Thrill, and many other very obvious ones. If it is supposed to be best of,I mean comon. It may have been just a compilation of Brian Johnson, so why is Ride on on here. Take my advise, this is a waste of time."
4,This rocks!,"Yo this is one of my favourite albums at the moment mainly because of Sink the Pink. Yea I know it ain't the best AC/DC song ever but man it rocks! All the tracks are good and the best part is not all the songs are new which means that the diamonds in the rough of the cruddy albums are in here! Sink the Pink is on of them and shake your foundations. I highly recomend this album for newbies to the band and die-hard fans 'cause its got a nice set of songs. Exept Ride On, don't get me wrong its a good song but its not Bon's best.Ride on Bon Ride On"
3,Only rated this 3 stars because it's a compilation album,"If it wasn't for the song Who Made Who, this would have been terrible but that song saves this from being a crappy cd. LOVE WHO MADE WHO. MY second fav AC/DC song, first being Shake Your Foundations. I'm only going to review the three songs on here that don't appear on their other cds.Who Made Who 100/5 - LOVE THIS SONG! Awesome! It's about how electronics are controlling people instead of people controlling electronics. This song was ahead of its time.D.T. 4/5 - An instrumental by them thats pretty good.Chase the Ace 3/5 - Another instrumental thats decent but gets repetitive.All in all not bad but just get it if your a casual fan or if you have a weakness for Who MAde Who like me."
4,Pulls together many of their hits,"This seems like a compilation album, though not titled, as these songs - hits for AC/DC, can be found on other albums or is it just that they got a bunch of great radio rock tunes on one album finally?"
2,Who Made Who,A movie soundtrack for Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive. A Fair mix of AC/DC tunes. For the hardcore AC/DC collector only.
5,Nice one.,"well, it is good, i used it for reinstalling the operating systems.The surface of the disk is so clean. No stains and scratches.No faults founded until now. Good choice for reusing purpose of disk..."
2,Unbelievably over-priced,"When I first bought this machine I thought it was wonderful. I liked the editing features and the TV Guide for setting record times, etc. Then later the unit would not get the TV Guide channel info, then weeks later it would, then later again it wouldn't. Don't know if this was the fault of the cable provider or the unit itself. However, suddenly now after two years it has gone hay-wire. First the DVD drive went bad, then it started giving error codes when trying to use the remote. It is totally useless now. I can't believe that they are asking $1600 for this now, when only two years ago I paid $455.00. I think anyone would be a fool to pay that kind of money for this machine."
2,DMR EH55s,"A nice unit with plenty of features, but I have a unit I have to return to base so I will be without it for a couple of weeks as it gets fixed. It could have been a very nice unit, the features are rich, the capacities are large the interfaces and media support are varied. The tech support from Panansonic was fair, but they tried the setup and it failed so its a straight retuirn to base... that's what lets it down."
2,Problem with Setup,Arrived quickly but in trying to get it set up in my config - I had to turn the unit off and on a couple of times trying to get it hooked up to my older TV via a RF Modulator. When I finally got all the connections correct - the setup program always hung on the TV Guide setup. Would never go into it. Unit would reboot. Returned for refund. Have a previous Panasonic DVR that I am very happy with.
4,Very Pleased!,"I purchased this Unit In January, I've used it for about 4 monthes now. I love the ease of this unit, and the amount of room on the hard drive. I have some issues with channel listing, but from what I can figure it's because of the fact the area I live in has differnt channel listings and it loads more than one, thus giving us 3 different listings for channel 5! Other than that I find that I love it!"
5,One the best cds I have!!!,"This whole cd is incrediable!! I almost never take it out of my cd player. I can't sit still when I listen to it!! She has an awesome voice, and her lyrics are so moving. And not to mention sexy! Everything about it is sexy. I get all my friends to listen to it. She rocks! Buy it, buy it, buy it!"
5,Gay life in the past,"I found this book to be absolutely delightful. Given the time, place and circumstances, I think Mr. Brown made the best of his situation and had a nice life. His experiences were ordinary but told so vividly I had a good idea of everyone and everything mentioned. To me he spoke not with disappointment and sadness but I think he maintained a sense of pride in himself and has fairly good memories of his young gay life in Minnesota that I am so glad he shared with us. Even though the book is short and rather expensive, don't miss out on reading this. If only Mr. Brown had lived to hear our comments and know his writing was published. I read a lot of biographies and this was one book where the person seemed well adjusted, not unhappy with themselves and made the best of life."
2,boring,There are only specious connections to U2's music in this book. Don't be fooled by the nice cover.
4,Arthur as he might really have been,"Wonderful retelling of Arthurian legend as it might have really happened. Told from the point of view of Bedwyn one of the last of the Roman Britains. He tells the story as he looks back from his later life and tries to answer the misconceptions and legends that are already sprouting up some 20 or so years after the death of Artyr. He gives an accurate description of life as lived at the close of Roman Britain and the early part of Anglo-Saxon Britain. If you'd like to see how the Arthur story might have been without magic or mystery, but just plain reality this is the book for you."
5,"Fantastic! Not just the drumming, but all the music!",I really love Vol.1 and Vol.2. The music is fantastic big band. I would recommend anyone who enjoys good big band music.
2,"Great Drummers of the 20th Century , Bad CD","This has most of the most important Jazz and Rock Drummers from the 20th century. We have Gadd,Peart,Bruford,Cobham , all Great drummers and great drumming on the albums. I have to say I love Jazz and Big Band stuff, but the music on this album is not that good. The best Big Band arrangement is done By Bill Bruford, who wrote His arrangement , most of the others sound Boring. I would get the DVD of the Making of this CD , ITS more entertaining. Also Try Phill Collins ""Live In Paris"" and the song ""LOS Endos"" for a Big Band arrangement done well."
4,Easy to put together,This was very easy to assemble and was good quality. The colors were vibrant and the bins were deep enough for the toys. Nice orangizer.
3,Sony Blank DVDs,"No problem with the DVDs, but not sure wh I bought it online. It's much cheaper walking down to a nearby electronics store and getting one. The cost + shipping adds upto charges for which I can actually buy 10 DVDS.Product- well no comparison, Sony is as good as you can get."
1,Bolt on leg broke after one week.,That about says it. Had to find my own hardware to fix it. Just waiting for the other two legs to go now.
2,a sure cure for insomnia!,"This is probably one of the most BORING autobiographies I have ever read. While Marianne Faithfull's autobiography is written almost as a novel, Bill writes as if just outlining the facts. All he talks about is how mean Mick and Keith were to him and how many women he slept with at the time (and bragging that that number was more than Mick and Keith combined). Poor Bill. Maybe if he had stood up for himself instead of sleeping with all those women, he might have gotten a say in the music once in a while! If you want riveting information about the Stones, read Marianne's book ""Faithfull"", if you want a cure for your insomnia, read ""Stone Alone""!"
5,Fantastic,This game is a lot of fun. Hours of fun for me and my friends and almost everyone knows how to play.
2,snowflake cookie cutters,"Was not crazy about this product. 2 of the cutters had super sharp metal burrs on them and can't be used safely and even the ones that can be used are not very useful. The detail gets lost as the cookie bakes and spreads out (even though my recipe spreads very little) so a lot of extra work is required when decorating to put the detail back in. Still if you enjoy doing elaborate designs with writing icing (use thinned royal icing with a small tip and a tiny hole), then the larger and less detailed cutters in this pack might work well for you. Even though they were a lot of work and I couldn't use 2 of the cutters the end result was beautiful. I used white icing then dusted with light blue glitter flakes (made from sugar) and then piped on the detailed design. I then added sugar pearls at the points and 1 in the middle and they were stunning in the finished cookie tins that I give as gifts every christmas. To me this was too much work though and I won't use them again."
4,LOUD hamster wheel,"This is a great starter hut, but you need to get tubes for them to run in right away. You also don't want this to be near any sleeping areas, as the hamster wheel rubs and squeaks VERY loudly."
5,A big fan,Well since im a big fan of the series i was most willing to give it an excellent review just because in almost every episode there is a battle no mistakes
5,Rev. James Cleveland At Carnegie Hall,This Album is just fantastic. It has always Blessed my soul Jame White
2,Less than Impressed,"She, much like other actors who act like musicians, needs to stick to the big or small screens. The overall quality of the songs is quite poor and the lyrics are relatively shallow.The one thing that I can't understand is that my friend Doug can't get enough of this album. I theorize that he likes to dream about associating the title of this album with his ""Party of Five""."
3,What were they thinking?,"All I have to say is who thought this was an appropriate title for her CD? I mean she was what 15, 16 when she made it. I can't believe somewhere along the line no one was like, ""Hey, maybe that's not the greatest title for a Cd 10 year olds are gonna listen to!""PS: Yes, I realize it's not meant ""that"" way, but it's pretty easy to mistake."
3,Jennifer made a bang with this CD,"JLH singing surprised me. This young girl is something to be heard. I love the album-titled song Let's Go Bang. It's edgy and completely nothing like what one would expect from JLH.I really enjoyed the saultry ballad 'You Make Me Smile'. My favourite slow song is 'Everywhere I Go'.The only problem with this CD, (like her second one) is that there is not enough musicality variety. Most of the songs are slow, and do not carry punch. She does excellent pop music, as demonstrated with 'Let's Go Bang', and I think she should experiment more with that type of music.Inexpensive and a great listen. Look for her 3rd album coming out soon."
1,"Boring, bland studio created R&B",I like Jennifer but this is faceless music. Producers galore making their music and she is trying to sing over it.Try Barenaked instead...at least she contributes to that one.
1,"not good, sorry","Sadly, I was horribly disappointed with this CD. I mean, everybody has different tastes in music, but as for me, I later regretted getting this CD."
1,Cheesy and Cliched Lyrics,"This recording contains some of the cheesies and most cliched lyrics ever. ""Let the beat take you over""? ""Sun shining""? Please, let's get something original next time, okay?"
2,Watch the Menu Screen -- It's Funnier and More Interesting Than the Extras,"I loved Gilbert Gottfried in ""The Aristocrats"", and have enjoyed him on radio. Here, he is basically the Henny Youngman of dirty jokes. Every joke is old and at least one I heard 25 years ago on a Bette Midler album. The jokes where I couldn't hit the punchline before Gilbert did, my wife could.The ""extras"" -- clips of Gottfried where he apparently turned a home video camera on himself, rambled for a few days and then edited -- are just terrible. He does a great Bela Lugosi impression and he's the first person I've ever seen do Alan King. All his other impressions suck.Unless you haven't heard the jokes before (and there's probably SOMEONE who hasn't), it's a waste of time."
4,Awesome stand up,Classic dirty jokes delivered by one of the best joke-style comics ever. Even if the joke isn't that funny- Gilbert has a way of making it hilarious!
2,One trick pony,"An hour long show of Gilbert Gottfried doing one liners, with a 20 minute Aristocrats joke at the end. Most of his jokes are somewhat funny, a couple are hilarious and many are just plain shocking. It's not really something you can watch twice though."
5,Great!,The best magnetic frames I've found. Full magnetic back so it won't fall off the fridge when you close the door. Sleeves so you don't have to worry about the picture falling out like some I've tried.
1,Bad recording job!,"The music in this album is alright. The problem is that it is a bad recording. Out of 30 songs, only 2 are complete. All other songs are cut short between 5 to 15 seconds so you never get the complete song. I do not think this was on purpose because the songs do not ""meld"" into the next. They just suddenly stop. The next one starts after a pause. I suggest you try another compilation."
4,Fireworks: a History and celebration,"This book is a Christmas gift. It looks good, but since I haven't given it yet, there isn't much to tell."
4,Based on a book,"Anyone complaining of the bad ending of the movie, should really try reading the book, Portrait of a Young Man Drowning, on which it was based. It's actually very well done, if you've read the book."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"This may have been the worst movie I have ever watched. Debbie Harry was miscast; the plot was immature and silly; the acting was wasted and the direction went nowhere. The movie couldn't decide if it was a ""black comedy"" or the escaped vision of a drug induced writer."
3,Not as described,"I bought this wire because it is described as having been made in the U.S.A. It is also supposed to be shipped from Parts Express. When it arrived, it was shipped from ANY-CABLE-N-MORE and the label stated that it was made in China. Apparently, you can't rely on the truth of product descriptions. The cable is alright, but it is not as it was described."
5,was greaat (book about Picasso),Great book. Was send in a perfect condition and on time although I live in Holland.Next time I will buy agaian using amazon. com
3,too many drumloops,"Being a long-time Freeman/Rippingtons fan, I have to say that this is not Freeman at his best. Don't get me wrong, his playing is exceptional but maybe he should have laid down the drum machines and used live drummers instead. I think this is what really prevents this cd from shining."
5,Wonderful book.,"This is a wonderful book on painting landscapes in watercolor. I went through this book copying each painting that appealed to me and now can paint landscapes, skies, water, trees, weather...everything that please me. I can't explain it. Magic."
3,"Good in some ways, but a horrible use of paint","This book is helpful in understanding how to develop a painting, but the author's color mixtures are surprisingly awful. Well over half the paintings in this book show us EXTREMELY dull and chalky skies and landscapes. The author appears to have no understanding that watercolor paints have different qualities--nonstaining, staining, and opaque. Mixing and glazing these colors without understanding these differences result in the mud paintings throughout most of this book. If you compare these paintings to other watercolor books, such as those by Dobie, Carbonnetti, Nechis, Speckman, and many others, you'll see a huge difference. Jim Kosvanec's ""Transparent Watercolor Wheel"" [this is a book, not just a color wheel] is extremely helful in bringing out the most in watercolor."
3,"Well developed, but a bit over-detailed","I don't have much to add to the recent reviews, other than that I loved the whole concept and implications of the book, but got bored and tired of all the detailed history. It was as if he would be disbelieved unless a mountain of evidence was provided. In a way I can't blame him, given the trashing that the left gives anything published by Regnery, regardless of content.Great concept, and worth pouring through it, but it could have been written in half the pages."
5,Great for steak and potato meals,Deep dished type skillet great for cooking meals on open flame. Great for camping or backyarding. Purchased several sizes to enjoy this spring/summer/fall.
5,Heartland Series,My daughter is a homeschooled 6th grader. Her passion is horses or anything that has to do with horses. I have her on a reading regimen with the Heartland series. She is really enjoying them. I am also excited that they are age appropiate with much detail. She is getting a lot out of them.
4,Vandenberg and his debut remains his best work,"Unfortunately, Adrian Vandenberg never did anything so good and fun to listen as his debut album (in my opinion). We must remember that he did not play on the mega-seller Whitesnake's 1987 album (John Sykes did the job).This debut is pure hard rock, driven with determination and no fillers. Yes, it has a certain ""hair metal atmosphere"", but at least the drum sound is not plagued by that electronic feel of the mid-eighties. The guitar solos are economical and cirgurgically placed, extremele well tastes. The vocals are also a hig point in the album."
5,I LOVE these boxes.,I have a small business and a professional office. For years I have stored every tax year's documents in these Oxford boxes. When I need a return or info I can easily go to the right place fast.
1,The poorest service I have ever received,"The 2nd hand Green Zone BD I got had a broken case, email seller for replacement but seller was very slow in response, took more almost 2 weeks to get a replacement. Then after reviewing details of my purchase, I realized that it wasn't what I ordered - I ordered the 2 disc limited edition with digital copy, but received only the single disc version without digital copy. So I contact seller again, and he said mail it back for a refund .... so here I returned it again, only it is more then 2 weeks after he received my returned BD but I am still waiting for the refund. Will definitely not buy from this seller again, and not recommend other customer to purchase from this seller!"
4,Enjoyable,"Regardless of the facts of the film, it still draws attention to the real fact that there were no WMDs in Iraq and that the U.S. people were lied to, repeatedly."
4,Not a Bourne movie by far.,"I like Matt Damon. This was a good movie to me in respect to all the other Iraqie war movies I have seen. I am still hoping for another Bourne movie. I am not sorry I bought this movie. For Matt Damon fans, I recommend this movie."
1,Not Enough Research,"For an action drama, this movie delivers. Well-written dialogue, talented actors, and a realistic depiction of the early mistakes in the aftermath of the Iraq War (not enough troops to provide security, failure to provide food and water to the population, etc.). However, the production should have done more research into the search for WMDs. If they had, this would have been a much different movie.Especially if this film had been made after the release of the Wikileak documents which give further evidence as to the existence of WMDs and provide documentation as to WMD caches which have never been reported before in the media.Sometimes timing is everything."
2,"""don't be naive""","Eh...It was an ok film, modern day Iraq w/ an army unit looking for WMDs, this film is also political. Damon did a good job acting. Interesting in that sometimes what the military wants and what the govt wants can be completely different things and the two sides can clash, and the resulting media spin to the public for what they want us to believe is happening. A few good chase scenes but that's about it. An ok rental, I wouldn't buy it though. I had to deduct a star due to the horrible shaky camera effect through this film, I get what they are trying to do- to make it seem more realistic, for me though it just doesnt make it enjoyable to watch."
2,"Saw it, lived it,","Saw it and lived it. Good action sequences. Fast paced. Decent story line but the movie is propaganda looking to make a political statement and as we see now, it turned out better than the left would have us believe. Iraq is ruling itself and we don't own their oil fields."
2,What is the point?,"The story is fictional. The whole reason we went to the war is due to a single faulty intel from a fictional character named Magellan? Give me a break. The movie is nothing more than a liberal's attempt to attack on Bush Administration and it turned out weak. They would make their case stronger if it was based on actual historial events.Iraq would have avoided the war if they allowed UN inspectors to come in and VERIFY there is no WMD like they claimed. Makes you think who is stupider, Bush Administration or Saddam Regime?"
5,green zone,this was a great movie and i enjoyed every minute of it and would like to keep it to watch it later
3,Matt Damon rocks in GZ.,"Matt Damon is okay, but the script is weak. So so watch. Not as good as the Bourne movies. Also, the action is brief. I would say rental."
1,More Liberal Claptrap,"No need to comment on the texture of the transfer or the sound; this is just another Hollywood example of getting another dig at President Bush. The script looked like it could have been written by that flunkey of our present President. Damon's acting? Didn't the armed forces learn some martial arts? He looked like a mountain man wrestling with a bear.If the liberals want to make a point, do it without me wasting $4.99. I'm still waiting for Hollywood to make a movie out of that glorious Jimmy Carter rescue or Clinton's attack on a small place to divert attention from his affairs and possible impeachment. So glad I didn't buy this video (btw, the grainy texture was terrible).WMDs? Not finding does mean non-existent. I've never seen a polar bear with my own two eyes, but I'm sure they're there nonetheless. We took out a dictator, and now the people in Iraq have a say over their own lives. Why don't you show that, Hollywood?"
1,BAD MOVIE.,"""Green Zone"" has a point in mind - that the U.S. government made up evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction to invade the country and impose an America-friendly democracy in the Middle East - and the perfect liberal, All-American actor to carry out the mission is Matt Damon."" Only the frist couple of minutes was mildly entertaining. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME ON THIS CRAP!"
4,"Fast-Paced, Well-Acted, and Thought-Provoking","The hand-held camera effects didn't bother me. I found the movie disturbing and its ending especially provocative. Matt Damon was terrific, as ever. Well worth watching -- and pondering."
2,Green Zone a loser for a usually winning team,"Green Zone is about the search for non-existent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq after the fall of the Hussein regime. Director Greengrass and Damon make the pace as frenetic as it was in Bourne three. They succeed with the pace, but the story just isn't there. The best thing about Green Zone is that maybe Damon will realize he should have gone ahead with Bourne Four. I bought the Blu-Ray version with the digital copy. I like the idea of the digital copy so I can watch movies on my computer while other family members use the T-V set and/or its DVD player. This is not the worst film ever made, not even the worst Damon film, but it's not in his top ten either. Only for real Damon or Iraq war filmGreen Zonefans."
1,propaganda,"not only is this movie terrorist-sympathizing propaganda, but my review from a few days ago has been removed, proving the forces behind this HORRIBLE MOVIE despise freedom of speech. so here i am again, to inform any fence-sitters, to avoid this movie at all costs."
3,"No WMDs, No Action Either","Another of Jocko's Short But Sweet Reviews:This thriller gave some good insight on the workings of the American government (CIA, Military, Government) but I was really expecting a summer popcorn movie.Good beginning, only to falter 1/2 hour into it.....Was hoping for a Jason Bourne Goes-to-War flick, but instead got a Jason Boring.....yawn.Show me the WMDs! At least make some up! Oh, I guess they did.... ""wink"""
2,Not a thriller like the Bourne series,"I was expecting much more from this movie. I guess I expected a lot of action similar to the Bourne movies in which Matt Damon has appeared, but I was sadly mistaken. It is an ok movie, too political and not enough action."
4,Classic,"Great perspective for the psychology of being happy and fulfilled. Frankl astutely points out that happiness is a relative condition and that having an inner sense of an all encompassing sense of purpose that has worth to you makes even the most horrible conditions and bad things that happen to you endurable. Refreshing respite from Freud, Jung, Skinner, Rogers, et al Belabored the introduction some."
4,Very good reference for key variations,"The Sveshnikov Sicillian is an extremely dynamic agressive opening which has been used by top grandmasters including Kramnik, Shirov and Nunn. Black sacrifices pawn structure for dynamic piece play, and the middle game strategies can be very rich and complex as a result. White usually tries to get a grip on the light squares, to try and reduce black's counterplay, whilst black will try and exploit piece play, usually by trying for a violent king attack. This book by Krasenkov who is a loyal exponent of this opening, provides up to date coverage of this defence, and can increase the black player's confidence in playing this opening. Indeed it is the possibility of such as razor sharp defences like this, that is prompting White players to chicken out with moves such as 2. c3 :-)"
5,summary of CD,I don't know who wrote the review saying that testement was an of-coulored Mettallica band but that person's crazy. Being a mettallica fan myself I can say that Testement does things just as well as Mettallica and even better when it comes to guitar solos. This is a great album for metal lovers.
3,Didn't live up to expectations.,"Mmmm... I have to say that I have trouble liking Testament. I heard a live a live bootleg of them playing in Dynamo, and I couldn't get Chuck Billy's amazing voice out of my head. Down For Life Was amazing. But then I bought this album...It's kinda strange really, since I'm a fan of Slayer, Anthrax, Metallica, Forbidden. The bootleg gave me high expectations about this album which it didn't live up to. I can't explain it - there's just something missing. I have to say that I do like Chuck Billy's vocals a lot, they sound quite unique compared to most bands. Other than that, I find this hard to get into. Some of the best Testament songs (D.N.R., Down For Life) aren't even on this CD which was released before they were.Perhaps it's 3.5 stars."
1,Fake product,I bought this for a present to impress my lady's mother. Her mother has a very keen eye in such products and can spot a fake product right away. One thing is that the bottle was not correct with the labeling and the smell of the product was not very strong at all. This disappointed her. So I had to go and buy something else of quality to replace this fake product that was sold to me.
4,Sumptuous indie film,"""Box of Moonlight"" is an impeccably charming movie, to say the least. It's refreshing, silly, and dramatic, while being ""classified"" as a comedy, when it should have been ""comedy/drama."" Anyway...The acting is first-rate, while the actors are more B-list than A-list, but that hardly matters. It's a free, flightful movie that'll you'll enjoy to see. But seems more PG-13 rated than R, due to some, but not graitutious, profanity, but frontal male nudity is plentiful. Sumptuous, free, silly, and charming, this makes for a summer movie lover's VHS/DVD collection.Rated R for language and for some nudity."
4,thumbs up!,"this movie is a little slow to start, but definitely gets much better. it is light and entertaining. the characters are well written."
2,The Agua Caliente Story: Remembering Mexico's Legendary Racetrack,It did not have a good account of the race track from the beginning. It skipped around too much. I probably could not have written a good book reeport with the information in the book. I would have been questioned regarding the track and not had sufficient answers.
4,Fun!,"This is a fun little container with a built-in magnifier to see the bugs better. My kids love to wear it while off searching for the next bug to examine. This doesn't get five stars because build quality could be better, but hey... for the price it works well! I recommend it and so do my kids!"
3,"Just a handful of hits, maybe a bit more.","Yes this is a pretty skimpy collection. On the grading scale I'd give it a D+. However it was released in the vinyl era when 9-12 tracks was the norm. What's here is all impressive stuff, but obviously there's bigger/better and more well-rounded collections out there at this point. Where this album does stand out though is the cover photo. I mean...is that a tight red sweater in a shower? Was this marketed towards men or what? Might as well be called Greatest T*ts."
5,Chayanne's songs,Their is a good variety of old songs mixed with new ones. It reminds you of all the songs you had forgoten. I really enjoy this collection of songs.
1,Very disappointing - Doesn't fit with the first two books.,This book feels like an early book the author had written and couldn't get published. A forced tie-in at the end does not make this a third Ember book. I'm not falling for another one. Too bad. Doon and Lina's adventures in the first two book were captivating. This one just lacks. - Sorry -
3,Ok... but not the book I would've wanted.,"The list. The first indicator that a book isn't going to be great. I let that go and let myself be absorbed into the fasinating world: the end of the world...However... I was biased because I read her other two books, which were simply amazing. This one did not live up to being the prequal, in fact, the book I wanted writen was hastily writen in the last 20 pages of the book! However, it get's my 3 stars because it was still well written, had interesting plot twists, and was a decent book. Buy it!"
1,Don't Even Bother!,"Has absolutely nuthin to do with books 1 and 2. Oh, except for like 5 page at the very end!! Sorry to say it, but i 'm dissapointed. I mean really, who puts a prequel in the middle of a series? And i'm sorry, could someone tell me what the albino bear is about? Cuz i dont understand. :("
2,Not sure how this fits with the first two,"After enjoying The City of Ember and The People of Sparks, I was really looking forward to some great background on the conflict that led to the creation of Ember and the destruction of the surface world. After all, the cover art is a falling bomb. Instead I got a character study, even though it was an interesting character study, that was only hastily connected to the Ember story at the very end. Maybe I expect to much from young adult fiction, but I really don't think there was enough information here for even the targeted age group to spark a discussion of how the disaster came to be. Will there be more in book four? I hope so, or else I fear I wasted some money this time. Big disappointment after the first two books."
1,Disappointing!!,"I read the first two books with my nephew and enjoyed them greatly. They were smart, interesting and suspenseful. There was so much detail and the action moved along at a very readable pace. This third book was truly disappointing. We kept waiting for something to happen, but nothing really interesting ever arose. It was repetitive and absolutely dragged in some places. It was an small idea that was stretched to fill too many pages. This idea could easily have been included as a chapter with one of the other books. At this point, we are not sure we really want to even bother reading the 4th book."
2,One of the worst prequels I ever read,"I was so fascinated by the first two novels I couldn't wait to get this one. Yet it is a prequel and really meanders around, then rushed the ending to try and make the connections back to the first two books."
3,I am a sixth grader,"This is the prequel to The City of Ember. It tells the story of an 11 year-old girl named Nickie, who goes to Yonwood, North Carolina to help her aunt sell her great-grandfather's house. While she is there, she finds out about a woman named Althea who had a vision of the world being destroyed. After this vision, Althea is only able to speak in short phrases. A woman named Brenda Beeson takes it upon herself to interpret what Althea says, and then has the whole town doing what she wants. Nickie stands up to Althea after Brenda states that Althea wants everyone to get rid of their dogs.I liked reading this book. It moved very quickly for me. I liked The City of Ember better. The only problem I had with the book was that the only time it tied into The City of Ember was in the very last chapter. I would have like this book better if it intertwined with The City of Ember more."
3,It's OK.,"As part 3 in this Ember series, Yonwood could be skipped. It's a long flashback, but the story really continues in part 4."
1,Weakest of the series,"I very much enjoyed City of Ember and the follow-up, The People of Sparks. The Prophet of Yonwood is not in the same class, however. It's neither a good read on its own, nor a reasonable set-up for the City of Ember."
1,WHAT HAPPENED?,"DuPrau has written The City of Ember and The People of Sparks two great books, but this is a complete downhill for me. I mean what the HECK, does an albino bear have anything to do with the City of Ember? You tell me cause I am clueless. No seriously tell me."
5,5th Grade Student,"I really liked this book. It might not be as good as Harry Potter, but I need something else to read and this was a good choice. I find it very interesting that this book actually is a prelude of the two other Ember books, even though this is the last one. All of the Ember books are good, though the first one, the City of Ember, was my favorite."
2,Prophet of Yonwood,"I seem to be a 40 year old kid when it comes to the Ember series. I loved the movie so much that I went and purchased the first and second book. I had no idea a third and fourth book was available until recently. I found the Prophet of Yonwood disappointing and, strangely, not in the same writing styleas the other three. This book adds very little background information to the series."
2,Unfulfilled Promises,"In the City of Ember we hear that in the past, there were 4 wars and 3 plagues. One would expect the book to be about those world altering events. Instead the book is much smaller and unconnected to the series except in the afterward. The book is about a small town led by a fear mongering holier-than-thou church lady who the author tries to make likable for longer than I could really stand. Also, some of the characters seem recycled with different names slapped on them. Grover for example seems like a less-brooding version of Doon who is interested in snakes instead of bugs.Skip this book. Or if you want to hear every bit of back-story about Ember, just read the afterward."
5,Some big complicated ideas made accessible for young minds,I was surprised at the depth of substance in this book. Our well meaning young heroine discovers that defining goodness is not a simple task of listening to others and doing what they say. Sometimes you have to think for yourself. This is a well told story- I actually read it fourth as it can stand on its own.
3,My Review on The Prophet of Yonwood,"It was a good book, but it wasn't what I expected. It didn't mention Lina or Doon once. But, I enjoyed the tale of Nickie."
5,"BLAZING, WELL DONE JOB CLASSIC","CLASSIC ,BUTTER, I CAN RELATE TO THIS ALBUM SO MUCH.HE GOT NICE FLOW. MANY HEADS SLEPT ON HIM.GOOD LUCK ON FUTURE. SEE YOU AROUND"
5,Awesome!,"I LOVE The Sims series! The Sims is a amazingly, fun game series as a whole, but I love the fact that this one has the matchmaker on it, it's one of the reasons I bought this game. If you love playing casual games, buy this one. This game will have entertained for hours. I'm so glad I bought it!"
3,Good Game,"Well this is a very well made game and it is alot of fun to play but you better have a top of the line computer to be able to play it smoothly. I built my own computer and I can barely run it. It also takes up A LOT of memory and you need a very big hard drive to install it I am talking like 80-120mb, Yea its that big of a game. But if you have the computer to run this game you will love it and you will stay busy with it for hours it is a very addicting game. I also like the fact that you can install other items from 3rd parties online, not to mention that you can also get them from EA. So thats really cool. So if you have the computer to run this game, then this is a great game to have you will never run out of things to do on it. You can also get Expansion games for it. So Good Luck and Happy Gaming!"
4,Fun!,"I thought this was an enjoyable movie - and I usually don't like modern vampire movies because they take themselves wayyyy too seriously. Eileen Daly (whom obscure movie fans will recognize as spokesvamp from the Redemption line of video releases) was perfect. It is no cinema masterpiece, but if you like sexy vampires in PVC catsuits and british accents this is a good time and has a good ending (even if the fight scenes are total cheese :)"
3,"Pretty Basic, not much depth.","It wasn't that great of a text book, it lacks information and seems more appropriate for a lower level introductory course. For those who are interested in learning Archaeology but have no prior background, this might work for you, but don't plan on using it if you are going to teach an upper level North American archaeology course. In my professors defense, the school misordered this book for his class, and since all the students had already bought it, he decided to utilize it. It is entirely a basic overview and lacks depth to really get deep into the subject. However, the cover feels amazing, so I'll give it points on that. (I'm not joking, I don't have a book with a better feeling cover)"
5,Linatone plus for dogs,"I have been using this product for the lifespan of 3 Lab/Shepherd mix dogs. They have always had wonderful coats and healthy appetites. The only drawback may be that they grow used to the flavor and if I forget to add it to his dry food, he will let me know by not eating!"
3,I don't really remember the book all that well...,"...but i do recall that it is obviously a rewrite of an outline or manuscript that the author originally did for the series of ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."" books, to which he contributed as ""John T. Phillifent""."
5,Best CD I ever bought!,"This CD is great! I can't stop listening to it...it's very addicting!The greatest thing about this CD is the variety it offers. Instead of a bunch of songs that sound the same, this CD has many different styles of music from hawaii. My favorite songs from this CD are ""Live a Little"", ""Pineapple Princess"", and ""I'll Remember You"".I would not think twice about buying this CD. It's definently a must-have."
4,Very Useful Book. Great for people training for their PPL,"This book has helped me immensely. Radio communication sounded like a completely different language to me when I first started, but this book helped changed that. Now, in order for the book to work, you have to not just read it, but study it. I highlighted things, ear-marked pages, and jumped around as needed. I gave it 4 stars only because it is very long and has too much information, if that is possible. I think it needs 2 volumes."
4,Excellent Aviation Communication Examples,Bob Gardner does an excellent job of explaining and demonstrating aviation radio communication. There's even a sample chart included to help describe specific situations and what should be said to the various agencies en route.The only thing that could make this book better would be an audio CD-ROM so one could hear real-world examples of things that are described in the book.
5,Great behind-the-scenes summary.,"This book is an excellent behind-the-scenes detailing of many of the major events that transpired during the Bush presidency. Find out what happend that did not make the newspapers. Find out how decisions were made, listen in on conversations. The book approaches each subject from a unique 3-way perspective. The President and Mr. Scowcroft each give their own unique view of what happened, along with a general summary. I couldn't put this book down."
4,Readable and attention grabbing,"President Bush and General Scowcroft give you a sense of the ""figure it out as we go"" excitement surrounding the events covered in the text: Russia, China, the Persian Gulf and Berlin. The Bush diary entries are heartfelt and moving adding a most personal dimension to the historical text. The interplay between President Bush's and General Scowcroft's entries also keeps the book very, very readable. The format makes the history come alive. Lastly, President Bush's humor comes through the page and adds a human touch to the activities of the principles. As important as were these events in our country's history, the principles working the issues were ""regular"" people serving the country as best they possibly could."
1,Run,"RUN,RUN,RUN...AWAY from this movie. someone has a tighty whitey fetish making this movie.nothing happened and no clear ending.is this the best we can do ? plus the most BORING movie I've seen in years.but I'm being very kind calling this thing a ""movie"""
4,Naked Without You (Remixes) Rock!,Naked Without You is one of the greatest dance hits to come along in awhile! The album itself is very good. Taylor Dayne is such a diverse artist with a style all her own. Keep it up Taylor!
5,Her best since You Can't Fight Fate!,"What a pity this CD did not get the same attention as say Madonna's ""Ray Of Light"" This is most certainly a 'Landmark' release...In fact, this title is not even listed in Australasia, record label's fault????If you like RRRRipppping belting DIVAs this is it!!!!!"
5,RELAXING MUSIC,I BOUGHT THE C.D. LAST MONTH. I THINK IT IS GREAT. IT IS VERY EASY LISTENING MUSIC. I LOVE TO HEAR IT WHEN I'VE FINISHED DOING MY CHORES AND ENJOY THE RELAXING SOOTHING MUSIC. SHE IS GREAT. I LOVE HER MUSIC. HAVE BEEN A FAN OF HER FOR YEARS.
4,Extremely Heavy Duty,"This strap is very heavy duty as the capacity rating states and appears to be very well made.However the picture did not clue me in just how large and heavy this item is. It would be great for very heavy vehicles or extreme use as the name suggests, but I ended up ordering the the 20' 20,000 lb version since this item would take up so much space behind the seat of the truck. Tightly coiled this item is 18"" x 6"" x 4.5"" in size."
3,Not kosher: materials are manmade.,"This tallis prayer shawl is a good price and looked fine, but if you are orthodox, be advised that this shawl is not kosher. It is made from manmade materials. This is fine for those who don't hold to the Torah commandments on materials: I'm guessing reform or perhaps conservative, or for Christians who desire a Hebraic prayer shawl."
3,"Great story on its own, but...","Prophecy was a great book on its own, but it fit in the Masquerade Cycle awkwardly, at best. It contains some vital plot advancement for the series (The Artifacts Cycle, Rath and Storm, and the Masquerade Cycle), but it seems to be tangled up in a relatively unrelated story. I'm hoping it all gets tied together in the upcoming Invasion Cycle, and this book doesn't prove to be relatively random..."
1,Bad Book,"This is one book that is just no good.What else can I say, I mean other than just beingnot well written it also had Rayne (who by the waywas a very cool character) killed off.*sigh*"
1,How can I not hate Prophecy?,"Prophecy is one of the lamest books I've ever read.Legends from the card series make cameos just to attractthe reader to the Magic World, not because there is anyreal good reason to have them around. This is such a wasteof paper I cannot imagine who would want to do this to readers."
1,Meh.,"I feel the story got completely sidetracked in this book. I found myself not really giving a rodent's behind about what happened to the main character - he's someone we don't know from previous books, don't know from the cards - why should we care? The ""Big Bad"" was introduced way too late, which is a shame because he was actually sort of interesting. And the fact that Jolrael's name was misspelled every time it appeared (as Jolreal) is just lousy editing.Overall? Decidedly unimpressed. Though it was good to see Teferi again."
1,KILLING THE ANIMALS,If you want to hear a singer destroy Eric Burton & the Animals songs get this DVD. You will hear Eric Burton himself destroy his own music. The worst. Don't waste you time or money.
3,It depends...,"If you've seen Eric live recently and want to relive the concert, I would suggest getting this DVD. If you've never seen him and expect the songs to be like the originals, don't get it. My feelings are really mixed about this DVD because I love seeing Eric in concert again, but I really want to hear the hits as I'm used to hearing them."
2,Soundtrack very soft,"As others have said, this is a fun workout even if the music/hair/outfits are somewhat dated. My biggest issue is that the sound quality is pretty awful - you can hardly hear the music behind the vocal instructions! And working out without music just isn't that much fun.Try the Hip-Hop Aerobics video instead, it may still be dated but at least the sound balance is right!"
2,kind of boring,This tape is alright but it doesn't exactly make you excited to exercise to it. The main instructor doesn't seem to have a lot of enthusiasm. The moves are kind of complicated adn they don't spend enough time explaining hem.
2,Very complicated,Very complicated dance video. Instructors are not good at demonstrating the steps and the steps are done very quickly. I had to keep rewinding the tape for weeks just to get the moves down.Instructors are in love with themselves.
5,Brighton Fink,"Curiously riveting low-budget crime caper from Blighty that segues seamlessly from droll domestic routines to sudden spurts of ultraviolence. Chronicling the implosion over two weeks of a minor family-run goon squad, Down Terrace plays like some new type of movie mutation where the mundane and the macabre are mixed to shockingly hilarious effect. Talk about getting under your skin! Plus the folk songs running through this bracing little flick add their own wayward wrinkle to the general sense of disequilibration. Utterly unpredictable and visceral, Down Terrace is Mister Wheatley's first feature film apparently and I gotta say I haven't been this impressed by a hitherto unknown quantity since getting an eyeful of Lenny Abrahamson's hypnotic and devastating Garage (2007)."
1,Insidepulse Movies - Mike Noyes,"Question: What do you get when you take a Guy Ritchie type crime story with the pacing of a Jim Jarmusch film and have it directed by Kevin Smith?Answer: You a get film about a bunch of criminal Brits who sit around the house talking about stuff.However, despite the talent of the influence and the quote on the DVD cover proclaiming the film to be ""profanely funny,"" Down Terrace is a boring blunder that fails almost every step of the way.Read the rest of my review here:It's also worth noting that the director contact me regarding my review. Despite my bad review he was a very nice guy."
2,Good Picture Book,"This is a good picture book and very technical. However, if you are interested in the philosophical foundations of Goju, it is not in this book. Since this was my prime interest, I was disappointed. Having said that, the pictures are very informative."
3,Good basic book,"This is a good beginner's book, as the name suggests, full of pictures of the stances and techniques. A few more on the history of the style would be nice. Some differences in nomenclature with the Okinawan schools must be taken into account. A fine basic book. Recommendable."
2,long term use,I've been useing one these for many months ... lately I've been seeing itermitent hangs of the machine ... today I took the covers off and one the SATA conectors fell off this thing ... cheap parts would be my guess be carefull ...
1,"Quite simply, a piece of junk.","If it weren't so frustrating, I'd almost say this device were a sinister practical joke played on the shoe-wearing public.This device is horrendously designed, with its flex-frame plastic body and ever-bending metal rods. The screws strip from the mounting door; if they don't strip, the plastic mounts through which the screws are to be installed simply tear from the constant flexing. The metal tubes on which the shoes rest bend, allowing the shoes to fall through. And there's nothing quite so scary in the middle of the night when you hear the horrendous, thundering rush of about 30 pairs of shoes crashing to the ground when the frame fails. My kids referred to it as a ""shoevalanche."" We tried to make this thing work, but ultimately, it was a joke.In a word, don't. Don't try to reinforce it. Don't try to fix it. This is a disastrous product, and if nothing else, salvage the $20 or so I paid for it by *not* making the same mistake yourself."
1,"If you only wear flip flops, disregard this review","This shoe rack fell apart under the weight of boots, sneakers and other shoes not made of foam and string. After a couple of weeks of full use two things happened: the plastic joints holding the three separate units of the rack loosened/slipped apart and the plastic tabs used to attach/screw the rack to the door ripped open. Duct tape can go a long way in fixing the joint problem but it's not a miracle. You can also use all sorts of extra hardware and/or adhesives to make sure the rack stays flush with the door at all times. But why put all that time and money into a cheap rack that ends up looking like Frankenstein (if Frankenstein were a shoe rack)? Just get a better one; it will last longer and look nicer. Plus, if you rent (as I do), going crazy with the super glue might be too permanent of a solution."
5,Widesread Rules!!,"I recently crushed my foot(broken in several places) and have been recooperating with the help of W.P. Although I have been heavily medicated most of the time this is still some of the greatest music I have ever heard. I've been a Widespread fan for a while, but until recently I have only owned 3 of their CD's. In the last month I've purchased every CD they have. They just get better and better. I can't wait til I break something else!"
5,"Great buy, great clarity","I will admit the built in speakers are tinny but I hadn't planned on using them anyway. That aside, the color and clarity is outstanding! I am so pleased with this purchase, and the price can't be beat."
3,"Good price for the size, but it has some flaws.","I bought this monitor primarily because of the price, which certainly is good. However, as others have noted, the speakers are terrible. The speakers in my laptop are much better. When set to 100% volume they're still low and very tinny. Very disappointing. Another problem I have with it is the stand. It's kind of light weight for a monitor this big. Whenever there is any movement of the table it sits on the monitor shakes noticeably. I think they should have dropped the speakers and beefed up the stand."
4,Value Kit but Not BSA approved,"This bulk kit is great for those who race within the den where the chairman is not too stringent of ""BSA approved"".The wood is identical but the nail and wheels are not. The wheel lack the ""BSA Pinewood Derby"" label.For $0.90 per kit difference for the label."
1,crappy crappy software and no mp3 support,"here's the quick and dirty on the sony net md walkman line... they work great and play great and the mini-discs are cool BUT their software absolutely sucks. you CANNOT just transfer mp3 files, you have to convert EVERYTHING to the sony proprietary format first and then transfer the files, and you have to do this all with the sony sonicstage software which is a major pain to use. on top of that the transfer rates are WAAAY slow. stay away unless you really love sony for some reason. had I known that you have to convert everything to ATRAC3 before it would transfer the files I would have never bought this thing."
2,OpenMG software would not work,"The sound from the nicely sized, small unit was great but the OpenMg software would not work for me on a Pentium 4 with XP Home. Spent over an hour on the phone with Sony tech support and still not fixed. Gave up on it and returned the unit."
2,No Mike Input????? Whose idea was that!,"In their eternal effort, it seems, to control customers, Sony has created the Net MD MA-N505. Looks cool, but if you want to take notes, record live music or interviews, FORGET IT. It will record LINE IN, but not MIC IN. And you can't tell from the packaging. Luckily, the store will take it back. Tomorrow. First thing. You betcha!"
1,Awful ~!,"This Book is complete waste of time. Most of the so called projects can be found online for FREE!@ The pictures and the steps are weak at best. The only reason I have not sent it back is because I'm working full time, going to college, and married with a small child. After opening the box and reading the book. It was stacked in the back of my closet and left there for a couple of weeks. The seller seems like they are good people. I feel NO ILL WILL TOWARDS THE SELLERS. BUT PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS BOOK."
3,Ductigami,"We purchased DUCTIGAMI for our 16 year old grandson. He wasn't all that enthusiastic about it, but then lots of 16 year olds are not enthusiastic about anything that isn't electronic."
5,Great!!,I bought this for my 15 year old son for Christmas and the first thing he made was a wallet. Its great! He is currently using it. He said it took him a little while to get the hang of things but once he did it was pretty easy. I would recommend it to anyone!
3,Adorable toy with some drawbacks,I really like this toy for my 18-month old. She loves putting the animals together and it's simple enough for her to play with by herself. The blocks are nice and sturdy as well. The downfall is that the noises are ridiculously quiet and they are not that clear. It has to be silent in the room for you to be able to hear if it is the cow or sheep making the noise.
5,a quality product,"my grandaughter is 20 months old and I wanted to give her something for Christmas that wasn't made in China so I went with the local-made-in-the-usa toy. To my surprise, she loved the colors and sounds but was a bit to young to fingure out how the blocks put together made the animal sounds. She keeps at it tho and brings it to ""mimi"" to play with her. I'm glad I purchased this quality product"
5,Great developmental puzzle,Great educational puzzle for young children. This is the only toy with batteries that we have in our house. This puzzle is sometimes used in evaluating kids.
2,Interesting if you know nothing about the adult industry,"Pornography and adult entertainment has truely grown within the last few years. Everything is pretty much accepted, so it's no surprise that more and more books are being written on topics such as these. My problem with this boko and many like it, is that they're all written along the same lines. There are hundreds of strip-clubs throughout the United States, Mexico and Canada. This book covers interviews with strippers to find out why they strip and how they feel about it. All the answers are the same, too bad. It should cover interviews on the men that visit these clubs. Why do they visit these clubs, what do they think about the strippers, how much are they willing to spend, etc. Since all these stripper books are the same, I was hoping someone would cover interviews with the patrons instead of the stripers. Overall, this book was not worth reading."
1,"""Season 4"" is just the last half of Season 3","Really disappointing if you purchase these expecting to see episodes of Saving Grace that would follow the episodes broadcast and available on DVD for Seasons 1, 2 and 3.These 9 episodes are simply the last (final) 9 episodes of Season 3, and are included on the 5-disk ""Final Season"" DVD set of Season 3 episodes. There was (is) no Season 4 of the show."
1,WARNING: This is an extension of Season 3.,"I purchased this so-called season 4 as a gift for my my wife because she so enjoyed watching the ""3"" full seasons listed on Netflix instant play. It was very disappointing when we started the first episode only to hear my wife say ""I've see this already."" Turns out these episodes are the last several of season three, according to Netflix and Amazon's policy is ""all sales are final"" on digital download material. Buyer beware."
2,Uninteresting and Improbable,"I have read approximated 20 novels by John Brunner (1934-95) and consider him to be one of finest writers of science fiction and one of the most unappreciated. It is with some regret that, in my opinion, this novel is not one of his better efforts. Frankly it was a chore to read to completion. It was not entertaining which has to be just about the worst thing you can say about a science-fiction novel. The story of a hunt for a kidnapped baby on Mars was just uninteresting and improbable for this reader."
1,Horrible,"This is a horrible album. I though C-Bo was good after hearing him on some of 2pac's stuff so I gave this a try. Its terrible. He has limited lyrical or flow ability, the production is terrible, and the album is just plain boring. I'm glad i bought it second hand fr $..."
2,A Misogynistic Bondage Fantasy,"The story of a man thrust into a foreign culture and place is often compelling, but what lies behind this story is the author's belief that women want to be owned and used like animals to be branded, beaten, enslaved, and used for the pleasure of men. This alternate world is a refuge of the author's making where the ""natural"" order of things can still exist, stripped of the emasculating mores of modern western culture."
2,Pretty Run of the Mill,"I really like dance movies even though the story lines are pretty much all the same and the acting is corny, but I like to see amazing dancing. This movie had a few great steps but not enough to warrant sitting through the same old tired parade of overly made up and accessorized girls, too perfect guys with puppy dog eyes and ripped t shirts, the inevitable hot and soulful good guy trying to win the heart of the reluctant and usually best dancer girl, and the bitterly smug bad guy. Really I don't expect any of these dance movies to be ground breaking in originality but once you've seen a few they do start to seem pretty much all the same, except for the dancing. And most of the dancing in this movie looked pretty high school."
1,The Man Only Has One Plot,"Evil, nasty, but stupid and inept bad guys get their hands on a superweapon that can destroy the universe, but the good guys rally around their innate goodness and sheer ginchiness and manage to defeat the bad guys and everyone lives happily ever after.If that's what you want, go for it. If you want complex and competent villains, heroes that actually do more than hold hands and focus on how good they are, and characters of all stripes that are intelligent, try Timothy Zahn or some other notables.And be very, very grateful Anderson hasn't tried his hand at Star Trek. We barely survived having Diane Carey as an editorial favorite."
4,4th time around,"Although the dB's lost some of their magic (as in originality) with Chris Stamey's departure, Peter Holsapple kept on deliverin' great songs. The most accessible of the 4 dB's albums in the 80's is still chock full of gems. Personal favourites are Change with the changing times, I lie, Bonneville, Any old thing, Workin' for somebody else, Never before and never again and Today could be the day. But you might as well pick others since all songs are fine."
5,Crazy In Love,"Have loved Michael Smotherman since I first heard him on Video Jukebox back in the 80's. This CD is great. ""Some People"" is so soulful it will make your heart hurt for love lost. Great CD!"
1,pro series charger doesn't work,"charger didn't work, tried on different sony products which use this adapter. didn't work on cameras, minidv player etc. cost more to ship back than product cost"
1,You get what you pay for!,"I recently purchased a ""NEW"" battery for my cell phone. Got a GREAT price. It was just under $6.00 shipped. The battery I recieved had no more life than the battery it replaced! You get what you pay for!"
1,Piece Of Crap,"Do not buy this crap the battery last for 2 months,Now it does not stay charged always plugging it in to charge it. Do not buy this jap crap."
4,Was late in arrival but works well,It took almost three weeks to receive it. Normally most of the orders arrive within a week. The battery fit the cell phone well. Charged up and has been working well for two weeks now. Holds the charge much longer than the previous 2 year old battery as you would expect. My original battery was BT50; but they sent me Model BT51 which fits my Motorola cell phone and working well! Satisfied overall.
3,Dogs of the world unite!,"I personally enjoyed the back third of the album. I expected too much from George on this one. ""I Ain't The Lady"" had that real old school (Funky worm) feel. ""All Sons of Bitches"" is still probably a little futuristic by today's standards, but is as funky as it wants to be. ""Sick 'em"" is pure genius. But there are definitely two to four songs that any eccleptic funkateer will enjoy on this one if you don't mind some of the language."
5,Beautiful Stones,"Turquoise Jasper Round Beads 8mm 15.5 Inch StrandTurquoise Jasper Round Beads 8mm 15.5 Inch StrandThe Chinese River Stone Beads are perfect. These are sound heavy beads with smooth ends and each bead has interesting color variations. They are bold enough to support intricate bead caps. I can combine my beads with pink, brown, grey moss green and black beads to make a necklace."
2,Not for dance moves,"I wasn't very impressed with this video. I was looking for dance moves to use in a high school pageant opening number. If videos would have been around when I was cheering in elementary school, this would have been perfect to learn a half-time routine...for 10 year olds. But the instructor standing there counting 1-8 all the time without actually performing the move is no help at all. I ended up using a video that had an instructor who counted and described each move as she performed it."
1,george adamski,"Be aware of the fake alien cults.I suspect, George Adamski, was apart of some kind of undercover nazi/russian project. I saw one of these ships in dec 31 2009. I've reported my experience to mufon and army core of engineers.(Currently, I have been unable to read his books. I will edit my review with statements from his books; when I read them. Maybe ancient alien theory is possible. But, if the aliens are white; take it with a grain of salt.)"
1,Not impressed,After using another type of foam that worked well but was much more expensive I decided that the reviews of this product sounded good. I had nothing but problems with the dispenser. The product itself is great and does what it says. If you can get it to dispense properly. I bought two cans which should have been plenty but with all the dispensing issues I now need more. I am going to get that nameless other brand this time. Very disappointed.
3,Loopy Guy Loops for laughs!!! and other jargon,"On the day when Tom Watson lost the Brittish Open in extra holes and a weekend when Tiger missed his second cut of his career - it is obvious to all that golf is not fair.Thus, this peek into the lives of professional golfers is fascinating. Golf is hard, very hard - and we know caddying is hard too - just not as hard - but this revealing book shows how tough it can be and how rewarding. Some of it reads like Greek tragedy - just shake that guy and tell him to stop that and do it THIS WAY...some is typical - ok billionaire guy, so your girl friend has real [...]...All in all it is a rare and sort of uncensored look into the real world of golf - a great read for those rainy days when you cannot get a tee time."
3,Good but not Great,"I loved John Feinstein's ""A Good Walk Spoiled"" (although I didn't like his follow-up all that much--""Open--Inside the Ropes at Bethpage) so I think that book set a very high standard for golf books. ""Who's Your Caddy"" has some terrific chapters but the book is spoiled by the author's use of a gimmick--he caddies for a blind golfer, a senior golfer, etc. Not sure why he came up with this gimmick when I would think what most readers really want is chapter after chapter of him golfing with great golfers. This lets you have the fun of his caddying with the added fun of getting to know people you want to get to know. So I only read half the book, picking the few chapters I liked, like the Lehman chapter."
1,Revolting,The chapter on John Daly and in other parts makes this the kind of book that is dis-tasteful. As the Amazon people know I read a winde range of books and books are my hobby and I will spend 600+ in a year and I will recommend books if I like them - this is the first book in a long while I was disapointed with. Says it is suposed to be humour - they mean TOILET houmor. Swearing and situations like John Daly.
1,Disappointing,"I love Reilly's work for the most part, but this is the same, tired joke, over and over. He repeats the same lines ad infinitum (just count how often he cites ""spam""). The only good essay was on Casey Martin. The rest was just repetition."
