2,A Round and Around,This cushion is just what I needed as I have arthritis in my neck.When I come to an intersection the cushion turns so I can see if cars are coming.Also like the idea that the cover is washable.Bertha
2,Too hard,Even though this had pretty thick padding it is very uncomfortable to sit on more than a few minutes. It won't fit in my car seats either. That is where we really waned to use it.
2,Doesn't work on a cushiony car seat,"I was hoping this would make it easier to get my elderly mom situated after getting in, and when getting out of, the car. It didn't help at all. The seats in a 2003 Buick LeSabre are too soft so the swivel seat sinks into the car seat too much and it then can't swivel at all. I tried using a silky pillow case on the car seat and that worked much better.I can't say for sure as I have not tested any other surfaces, but I think the swivel seat would likely work okay on a flat surface (e.g.: hard wood chair, metal bench)."
4,Good product.,Makes getting in and out of my car much easier. That is a big help for this little old lady!!
5,It is as described,"I took the risk of ordering this item, which promised to meet my needs. It did, nicely, and I'm grateful. Meeting a need is no small thing."
2,Deluxe Swivel Seat Cushion,"This product works great on a chair such as a dining room chair. However, it will not work in a bucket style car seat due to the contour of the bucket seat bottom thus preventing the cushion from swiveling. It's advertised to work in a car and it may work in a back seat but definitely not in a front seat."
1,A big disappointment,I ordered this product to ease my entry and exit from my car after hip replacement surgery. Perhaps it would work on top of a flat stool but it was a total bust on my curved car seat. I could not find a comfortable position that did not feel as if I were sitting on a board. The only reason I didn't return it was because of the shipping cost.
1,useless in car seat,I really needed this in our newer car but it did not fit in the seat. Too high and not very large.
2,It's OK - But Not For a Car,"I was expecting more from Duro-Med deluxe seat cushion. I bought this for our car to help my father-in-law, who has limited mobility, get in and out. The cushion adds nearly two inches of height. If he isn't careful (or rather us), he hits his head when getting in and out of the car. When he gets inside, his head now grazes the top, unless we put the seat back.The seat may be fine if not used in a car, but it does not work well in a car."
5,THIS TRAMPOLINE IS GREAT,... This is the biggest bouncing tramp ive ever been on. Its safe and high quality. It has lasted for ever. My parents were afraid that i might get hurt but it all ended up that i never have gotten hurt. GET THIS TRAMPOLINE. GREAT PRICE AND THE BEST!!!!!
3,Not recommended for Exam preparation.,"If you want to prepare for the MCSE exams, find a better book. I read the NT Server section and took the exam. I found out that there are a lot of ommisions on important test areas and subjects. You are are probably better off using one of the MS Approved Study Guides, which are, unlike this book, reviewed and approved by Microsoft before they are published. You may also want to use Microsoft's own training guides"
3,Too simplistci!,"I've only studied the Workstation section of this book, and it really is too simplistic for the exam. Yes, it's a good overall study guide, but without modest NT experience or additional study material, this book will not help you pass!! Beware of typos and incorrect responses to study questions!"
3,"Good book, if you already know something.","If you are going to read this book, you HAVE to read the NT workstation section first.. Otherwise you'll feel lost"
2,Suitable as a door-stop,This book rambled and contained many factual errors. I would recommend this book to no one who was attempting to study for a Microsoft exam. Total waste of time and money. Buy the Sybex books instead.
1,Wildly inaccurate,"I bought this product a year ago. There are times I think it is very accurate, and other times it is wildly inaccurate. I can measure the same ball twice and have two completely different readings. I have taken it to practices where other people have tried to use it for their balls. It will show a soccer ball that is blown up like a brick to be at 1/2 the correct pressure. Any more air, and the ball would blow up. If it had worked I would have loved it. Now I have to buy something else."
4,Worth the Money,I switched my 4 year old lab from another holistic brand because she was itching all the time and the vet suspected a food allergy. Two months later the itching has stopped...and there is about half as much loop to pick up. The auto-delivery feature is really convienent as well. No more hauling dog food home from the store or running out at the last minute.
5,Simply the BEST...,"I've used Norton's and PC-cillin and there is no contest. When my old computer refused to upgrade with Norton's antivirus program I came across PC-cillin via a magazine article. It had gotten good reviews and I had nothing to lose. I bought PC-cillin and it worked seamlessly. Updates, no problem. Scanning-thorough. To make a long story short- when I got my new computer I still bought PC-cillin 2003 because 1) it works easily, 2) it doesn't take over my computer like Norton's and 3) it came with a firewall at a better price than Norton's.- An overall good buy and they give you phone support if you don't mind calling California."
4,Good fun,"It's not as well written as some of the other Tenth Doctor episodes, but it's still entertaining."
1,Pitch Black rip...,"I'll keep this short and list the things I hated.1) The aliens - see pitch black2) Everyone knows the Doctor now - the Doctor being secret in his helping humans was what made his job thankless. Now everyone is cheering for him (like that scientist... I love this guy or whatever he said)3) Driving a flying bus looks like something out of Harry Potter.4) New sidekick doesn't even need the Doctor - she's so good on her own she could have her own show.5) I have a good suspension of disbelief but was this intended for kindergarten kids? You can't compare the seriousness of the danger in an episode like ""Blink"" to this one."
2,Dull rehash of prior episodes,"This was a very disappointing episode for sure. It was pretty much a rehash of several previous stories (the Doctor on the shuttle without Donna last year, and several others come to mind). The characters were not developed well and it was a very mediocre episode. I hope the final two of Tennant's specials will be better than this one. Tennant needs to go out with a bang, not a whimper."
3,I would rather have a box set with the extras,"This dvd release and the one for ""The Next Doctor"" in September is are what the BBC call the vanilla DVDs or used to call them that. With almost no special features they are sold so children and the less avid fans can afford them. This is not anything new it only looks that way as we here in North America are often so far behind the UK that the box sets are all we see and then the vanilla DVDs. So the there will probably be no commentary on these dvds,And the only reason that this dvd is coming out before ""The Next Doctor"" is that Planet of the Dead is the first episode recored in High-definition and they are releasing the blu-ray before the next Comic-Con"
4,"1888, A Visual Pleasure","1888 is a creative plot in which Jules Verne lived his own adventure in the Orinoco River in Venezuela and then he wrote ""The Mighty Orinoco"". The beauty of the landscapes and the powerful presence of the river as a character in the movie create a relaxed atmosphere that gives to the plot a perfect frameI really enjoy this movie!"
2,Not worth the price,"I bought this balsamic vinegar to try it, since I have previously bought the Gold version from the same company (La Piana Gold Quality Aged Balsamic Vinegar PGI) and loved it. This one does not come anywhere near the quality of the Gold. It is closer to the pricier balsamics from Trader Joe's (which are around $5 instead of $20) than to a nice balsamic. The Silver is fairly sour, the sweetness barely comes through. As for viscosity, it's very thin - if you're looking for the more syrupy kind of balsamic, this is not it.Given the small increase in price, it is completely worth it to go ahead and buy the Gold and not waste your time and money trying the Silver."
5,KELLIE PICKLER WALKIN AFTER MIDNIGHT IS THE BEST!!!,"I think the ppl bashing her are just bitter because she is obviously the best on this entire CD> She owned this song, I feel sorry for these idiots that think otherwise! PICK PICKLER!!"
5,Elliott is by far the true American Idol,"It's amazing to read all the reviews and how most of them pertain to Elliott Yamin. He came into the competition as the underdog and truly showed American what a gifted, talented, and humble human being he is. Elliott's rendition of Moody's Mood for Love brings tears to my eyes whenever I hit track #9 on the CD player. He truly has a beautiful voice. This song alone makes the CD worth the money. I fast forward through the majority of the songs or just skip the song entirely in a few cases. We can only hope that Elliott will continue on with his music career and put out more of his beautiful music for us true Elliott fans to listen to and enjoy. We Virginian truly know who is the season 5 real American Idol is."
2,Anything with Taylor...,"I think this CD would be a thousand times better if Taylor had sung all the songs on it, but whatever ;). I guess that Chris Daughtry and Mandisa are also good on this album, but when compared to Taylor, they all seem like Amateur-Karaoke singers. If you love Taylor, buy his single, 'cause this song is on it, and you won't have to deal with the rest of these Idols."
3,"Grow up, guys.","I just scratch my head whenever I read these childish reactions to the review. I FERVENTLY HOPE THAT AMAZON.COM DOESN'T BOW DOWN TO THESE STUPID, IMMATURE, SENSELESS REACTIONS OF THESE CRAZED FANS. A review is a review. With this one though, the reviewer is RIGHT. I know the sentiment is pretty strong but its time to GROW UP and MOVE ON. There is already a winner and runner ups. Another race is on- the one who will sell the most cd, this time however its not all about being cute and gimmicky on TV- its all about having a VOICE and great SONG MATERIAL.As for those threatening to boycott amazon.com- GROW UP!!!!Amazon.com will not go bankrupt for a few who can't take an honest review.The only reason to own this cd is ELLIOT YAMIN. Having said that, my ears are pretty clear by the way..."
4,Elliot fanclub has taken over amazon.com,"To review this CD - it has a lot of nice old songs for singing along in your car. To review the performances - I was never an Ace fan, but I think Father Figure is better than the original. I play Paris' Midnight Train over & over. And, Elliot - can't really sing along to this one. This one is just for the joy of listening. He is the true soul man of the season.This CD is fun, not to be taken seriously, but a reminder of a fun American Idol season.I look forward to Elliot's CD - and maybe he can talk Paris into doing an old Roberta Flack/Donnie Hathaway duet with him."
2,What a waste of money.,My friend just made me listen to it. My advice - Don't waste your money on this CD. You can go to your local clubs and karaoke bars to hear better singers. I gave it two stars because Elliott Yamin sounded rather brilliant on that James Moody song and Ace Young had one nice falsetto moment. The rest of them were either terrible or boring as hell.
3,Depends on what your type of music is,"It's pretty obvious that Tammy LaGorce isn't a Taylor Hicks fan. Such a shame that she can't appreciate him. Frankly, I've been pulling for him from the start and he is GREAT. The other songs are ok in my opinion...but quite frankly they bore me to some extent.As a proud Soul Patrol member, Tammy, YOU should hang your head in shame for such an obvious ""anti-Taylor"" review."
2,Not the Pictured Bag,I was disappointed since the bag I received was not the one in the picture which has the colorful design on the bottom. Mine came with the solid tan material on the whole bag with the embroidery as the only design. I was unable to return and get something else in time since this was a gift and the shipping took 5 days more than was estimated. Very disappointing.
2,Too much analysis of family dynamics,"Don't mix birding with complicated family dynamics. That's the take-away from this dreary, disjointed book. Koeppel basically sketches a biography of his father, one of the world's foremost ""birders."" While the two didn't share a very good relationship, Koeppel tries to be understanding and write sympathetically, to outline and explain his fractured interactions with his dad. He also writes about birding. All the stuff about Koeppel's father is maudlin drudgery. A lot of the birding stuff is enjoyable and interesting.It's not that Koeppel is a bad writer--he's not--but the topic was just too hard for him to write about without engaging in dismal reflection. He works hard to explain his father's avian mania. It's tough for us, however, to care about Richard Koeppel's psychology nearly as much as Dan does...because he's not our dad!"
5,Fascinating!,"When people come together, in the purest essence of love, with the intention to BE in the present moment and work as a community for the greater good of all, they are able to accomplish great things. This film proves that beautifully. I now consciously acknowledge there are so many more possibilities than anyone could ever imagine and I find myself living with this new perspective: What are the possibilities? We are indeed limitless. We are all able to get along as a society while protecting our planet and living happy, healthy, peaceful lives. Finding joy and bringing joy to others is our true purpose here on this earth. Fascinating in its scope, this must see film will touch you at a soul level, inspire your heart to open up to pure love and motivate your mind to think of all the possibilities so you will grow into your most authentic self."
3,A Fair Reference and Poor Lesson,"This book started out great. After some explanation, it guided me through a simple video editing project in the first chapter that worked and communicated some basic ideas. It got me excited about learning more and then it disappointed me bitterly.The rest of the book does not teach the way the first chapter does. It does do a systematic and fairly thorough job of explaining things in the interface but the usable examples are few and far between. This works well for some people but not for me. I learn better by doing along with the reading. This guide is woefully inadequate for that. Still, it is a handy reference. It's too bad I will have to further my training elsewhere."
5,Great Workout tunes,"I've always compiled my own workout music. Great beats and a smooth flow from one cut to the next are a must. I purchased this CD ona recomendation for just that purpose, a great solid background for working out. It is that in spades. Each and every cut is superb and I find it hard to believe I have a new favorite workout disk right off the shelf."
3,Sometimes a little boring,"This book was interesting--at times. I found the main character quite boring, but Francis seemed complex, and I found his tear tattoo fascinating. This is a rather typical ""coming-of-age"" story and did not do much to capture my interest. I basically struggled through the story, but I didn't find it unbearable. It was well-written, but simply wasn't attention-grabbing for me. I gave it three stars as it just didn't have what it takes to make a wonderful novel."
4,Puppy problems solved!,"My husband and I have a 10 month old puppy and one who is six weeks old. The oldest is housetrained, but now we are starting over with a puppy who will proceed to use our kitchen floor as his bathroom until he learns better. We bought this cleaner tonight at Target (sale right now where you can buy the Floormate for $129.99 and get a $30 Target gift card for Free!!) We debated this purchase for a while, but we are thrilled with the initial results... the water in the tank after we tried it in the kitchen was so horrifying that we immediately set about cleaning the wood foyer that we did not even think was dirty... think again!! We are very pleased and will update our review if our opinion changes. As of right now, I don't know how we ever got through the puppy stage without this last time!!! Quick note - We found that using half the amount of cleaner called for works well with no residue! Enjoy an easy mopping experience!!"
1,Waste of Time,"We bought one of these for Christmas and it went back within 2 days. After trying twice, it took me over an hour to ""clean"" my kitchen floors. Some spots I had to go over 7 or 8 times - and even then it didn't clean all of it up. Plus you have to go sooooo sloooowwwww. And it is loud. This machine loses suction at the slightest quick movement and you have to turn it off and back on again. Also, the water it does pick up is dirty so you have to handle it with your hands to dump it out. I have a 2 year old and infant - I don't have time for this ridiculous contraption. Try a steam mop instead, like the Reliable Steamboy. They're cheaper, faster (I can have my kitchen done in less than 5 minutes) and leave your floors ""white-sock"" clean and sanitized - without cleaners or chemicals."
5,A wealth of useful information in this book,Isle of Fantasies is a unique resource for self-discovery and enlightenment in your romantic life. You are provided with useful strategies to uncover the obstacles in your path and simple insightful ways to overcome them. Buy this book!
2,Missed the Mark,"This book was about 30 pages of interesting mystery surrounding the night that Isobel died. The other 330 pages were like watching other people's boring vacation slides, and present day drama that was ordinary and uninspired. (Teenage mother telling her mom that ""You just don't get me!"") I could have done without the irrelevant and LONG story of How I Spent My Summer at the Jersey Shore, since only a tiny part of it was even remotely relevant to the mystery itself, and the family drama and dynamics were completely different and also no longer really relevant to anything. This one was WAY off the mark for me."
4,A great read...,"I have read several of Diane Chamberlain's books in the past and have enjoyed them. This one was no exception. It was nice to read a book were the main characters were not in their mid thirties, but older with some life experience. Julie, Lucy and Maria were very interesting, realistic, well written characters. Even though I had pretty much figured out what happened half way through the book, it was interesting seeing how the story unfolded. If I have one complaint with the book, it was with the way the character of Shannon was written. Teenage girls written as selfish, brainless idiots in books have always been one of my major pet peeves. I wish she could have been written as a little bit more sympathetic. Regardless, this was a great read."
1,Not sure what book everyone else read....,"I generally love Diane Chamberlain, and own all of her books (and have re-read them multiple times). This book just did not hit the mark with me. I got about a quarter of the way through it and realized I just did not care AT ALL about these characters, about the mystery and about the book. Stopped reading immediately because I realized that my time was better spent elsewhere."
1,Disappointed with Fundamentals of Youth Football,"$30 bucks is way too much for what you get. Very short and general. If you can get it for under $10 it's a good way to kill 30 minutes, but besides that, it's a rip off."
5,great for small spaces,"I love to cook and especially bake. Having enough room for a project, even something simple like cookies, can be a challenge in the tiny kitchen in my 800 squar foot house. this rack is wonderful? I can fill a rack with cookies and put it on the stack. No my cookies can cool and stay crisp when they are supposed to, no problem. I got four grid-type cooling sheets to go with this rack and now I can bake enough cookies to take to work or to my daughter's class at school. I like very much that it folds flat. I had a little trouble getting the bottom loop to fold. I know that it needs to lock in to hold baked goods securely, but it is a challenge to work and the instructions about how to release it from the locked position aren't very specific. The rack is great in spite of this small complication."
2,"some parts very strong, other parts very weak","really great book concept. exceptional actually. lots of details that you really can't find anywhere else.but, as the previous reviewer said, what is up with the lack of diet info? i bought this to read to plan for our upcoming trip because my mom is going on a heavy diet, and this book was almost useless for that.but it does have a ton of great info on other things. i think it's aimed at people with more serious issues. surprised though that they did not capitalize on the diet craze and really do a run down of how to maintain a diet at disneyworld."
1,Really Horrible Item...,"Please do not purchase this item. It is not an appropriate or useful tool for soft contact lens removal. It is too thick and does not allow for easy use. I tried it and my eye was sore for days because I made so many attempts at grabbing the contact; the white part of my eye became red---and I was NOT applying lots of pressure!I gave the product ONE star because I understand what the developer was attempting to create. So, their intentions were good, however, it DOES NOT WORK well. I believe it ( because of the HARD PLASTIC) will cause more damage for contact lens wearers--over time, it will cause damage to the eye. Please beware...do not waste your money on this....PLEASE!"
3,book review,"This is a good book, but I think my expectations of it being special to my daughter exceeded her actual enjoyment of it. She rarely picks this book out for us to read to her :( I even wrote a special note in it when we gave it to her b/c I thought it would be special to her. I bought a second one as well to give to our younger daughter; I now wish I hadn't b/c I don't think she'll ""love"" it either. I like the book, but my girls are not huge fans."
4,Loosens earwax with ease!,"My child has a dry earwax that chuncks up in the ear canal and won't come out for anything. A couple drops in each ear, wait 10 min or so, and the wax loosens right up off the skin and can be coaxed or washed out easily.I would've given 5 stars, but I wonder if this is the same as olive oil, baby oil or mineral oil which I already have in the home? But I would've had to buy a dropper anyway. Either way, this is what I use in my child's ears, and we are both happy with the results. But when we run out I will research which of the above oils already in my home I can use."
5,romba pramaadam- double A - OK,"if u are a mallu or a south indian or north indian or any one who loves indian food and want to try a very authentic keralite malabar cuisine- this is the book- u can say AMMA's cuisine just like ur moms cooking tastes so good when u try these receipesthe appam the cardamom coffee,banana fritters.fish, avial etc etcthis book canbe recomended along with Maya""s other work curried flavoursfor those who are longing to eat like home in other countriesi would strongly recommend to buy this bookmaya has travelled to her ancesteral home to collect these reciepes for the mouths in United states and has done a excellent jobi do respect her as i do respect late Chef Raji Jalepalli of Memphis Tennesse, USA. Charlie trotter of Indian fusion cuisine"
2,Could be a Lott better,"A disappointing performance from Felicity Lott who, in other musical contexts, can be a delight. The tone is hard and too often shrill, with apparent effort at times in the upper range. The diction is poor, despite having a ""French"" sound to it; and the voice tends to forge on with little thought for finer nuances or text and phrasing. Maybe the setting is just too high for her. The accompanist, Graham Johnson, on the other hand, leaves little to desire."
1,Americans Who Do Nothing but Lie!,"Stay Away from this book. An honest objective teacher should be ashamed to have this book in their possession much less use it in class. It is nothing more than a veneration of hard leftist citizens save for several people like Eisenhower. It presents a very biased favorable view of each person listed. Many of these people are far outside the mainstream of political thinking. A partial list of those hard leftist covered are..Terrible book Rachel Carson -lied about DDT, Caesar Chavez, Howard Zinn- anti american socialist, Emma Goldman anarchist, Noah Chomsky, anarchist and socialist,WEB DuBois Marxist socialist admirer of Stalin, Wendell Berry anti industrailist, Molly Ivans lying liberal columnist, Jim Hightower another lying liberal columnist, Daniel Ellsberg,Paul ... See MoreWellstone,Eugene Debs, Bill Moyers, Malcolm X,Cindy Sheehan,Van Jones, Pete Seeger,Helen Thomas, Cynthia McKinney"
1,One more reason to send your child to a private or charter school - or even home school,"Your tax dollars are used to give this tripe to young, impressionable students (your kids). Noam Chomsky tells the truth? About what? More brainwashing from progressives and the left. Ideologically narrow and predictable. Is this really what you want your kid to believe? Good luck to you then."
2,doesn't come close to self-titled,"Not sure if I just don't like the songs they've chosen to redo here so much, or if the problem is that nothing interesting or new has been done with them. Either way, I only end up listening to ""killing moon"" ""Bela Lugosi's dead"" and a couple others. The self-titled album was great throughout."
2,Disappointing follow up to first album,"I am so in love with their first album, in fact it is one of the favorite cd's I own! I can't get enough of their first album, but I recently purchased this Bande A Part and was really disappointed! I really haven't listened to it that much, it just didn't capture my attention as their first album did. Now I don't know if I want to buy their latest cd or not."
3,Disk 2...,"I was waiting for a new Nouvelle Vague record, the first one was a rare, original and yet classic animal, and there are'nt that many gems like that.This disk has the same sonic qualities, but it lacks the edge the first one had, the songs are'nt as energetic and plane not as good."
3,The End Of Inspiration?,"Posle fenomenalnog debi albuma Nouvelle Vague su se sapleli.Jako bledunjave obrade sa samo par odlicnih obrada poput Fade To Gray koja zvuci mnogo bolje od orginala, Ever Fallen In Love ili Dance With Me. Ostatak albuma ili vas cini ravnodusnim ili vas jednostavno da prebacite na sledecu pesmu... Nazalost..."
4,"Good value, good quality","Well-made, sturdy bag that holds a lot of stuff, has good wheels and zippers, tough fabric. I paid less than $60 for it, and at that price it's a very good value."
3,Cute for some - just not me.,tank is cute for a 14 year old. XL is much smaller than I thought it was going to be. Not a bad thing cause it wasn't as cute as I thought it looked online as well.
4,For kitten-lovers,"If your children love cats, then this book will soon be one of their favorites. If not, then opt for one of the other ""Touch and Feel"" books, like Bathtime, Pets, or Farm, which include a variety of pictures. The textures in this book include fur, sandpaper (kitten's tongue), plastic (food bowl), and weaved basket."
4,Informing Us,"This book is very informative and enlightens us with the reality of TS. DeFlilippo has captured true to life events and used them to prepare adults in general about this disorder. I have placed one on my parents shelf and one on the teachers professional shelf to educate both about this disorder. I recommend all libraries stock it, because it gives information that is needed in our world to further understand persons with TS."
4,The most incredible vocalist for all times,"What can one say about a singer who Ella Fitzgerald described as the best voice of all time? What Sarah does is miraculous. Some of the songs are a bit weak, but, she makes them better and the great songs, she absolutely soars. Her phrasing and incredible range (some say 3 octaves, but, it sounds more like 5)make this album worth every penny. Dreamsville, Slow Hot Wind, Mr. Lucky are, for me, the highlights. There will never be another female singer with a voice like Sarah. This album is a good reminder."
3,Works good but after a few months i started having some issues,the mics sound great when they work.. after a couple of months of light use the sound gets choppy.. it seems to be when i have the power on for over an hour or so.. the mics sound crappy.. but for the 1st hour or so they are perfect..
2,Gimmick,"These are really gimmicky. I bought these quite a few years ago, and use them from time to time, but they work no better than any other bourbon glass, and don't enhance the nose or the flavor like a glenclairn glass.Unless you hate money, pass on these."
3,In Depth?,The only thing deep about this one is the snow you'll see in the footage. Beautiful scenes but that's about it. Don't get me wrong...I wasn't expecting to see Bigfoot in a snow condo somehow this one just missed it.
1,disappointed,"Bought this Barbie case for my daughter and am disappointed with it. There is nothing on it at all that says or shows Barbie, it is just blah pink. The handle fell off the first day and got lost. Inside, it is very deep and has slots for the barbies to stand up in and then just a deep wasted space. No way to organize the clothes at all. The top has very shallow compartments to keep small stuff in... but they are hard for little hands to open. We just don't like it and my daughter doesn't play with it at all. An expensive mistake. :("
3,Not as great as I had hoped...,I had big plans for this case to be the ultimate storage solutions for my daughters' Barbies and all the accessories. The product photo implies the Barbies are able to be stored standing up in the case. There are no individual compartments or dividers and the main compartment ultimately seems like a big pink bin to throw Barbies into. I think the top two compartments will store small parts well. Just hoping the girls remember to close it well before accessing the main compartment and it all flying everywhere! I've only had it a day so can't yet attest to the durability. Everyone of course loves pulling it around the house!
3,"Nice storage, but lid doesn't stay closed","This tote holds plenty of clothes, accessories and play sets if you are a fairly competent organizer. My only complaint is that the main lid does not stay shut and the accessories mini lids open with the impact of the main lid opening all the way back onto itself. And maybe we just received a dud, I don't know. Otherwise the design and capacity are great for its size. A bit pricey too."
1,piece of junk,"I bought this last Christmas for my little girl and it was hosed in a few months. It is not very durable. The pull handle broke off, and the top closure came off the hinges more times than I care to count. You're better off buying a clear Rubbermaid container."
4,***,"Overall I thought the product was great, but the handle was whimpy for the size of the storage box. My granddaughter did love it."
4,There is only one other product on the market that bets it,I have only used one other product that is better I have terrible allergies and it does not make me have a headache or make my scalp itch
5,"Margaret Mead Meets Capa, meets the Easter bunny","rented the movie then bought it on Amazon. This if certain documentaries were ediblestaples....this movie would be ""our daily bread."" Can't say enough about the directingand score. As for the subject, Bill Cunningham is margaret mead, robert capa, the easter bunnyand a jesuit priest all rolled up into one."
5,Even Sweeter Than the First,"After having read Ms. Ascher's first book I was looking forward to the second. I was not disappointed!! This was a ""hard to put down"" book full of great characters and an exciting plot. I recommend it to everyone. If you haven't read the first, read that one too. Can't wait for number three."
1,Very boring !,"""Succubus"" is incoherent, confusing, and, above all, very very boring. I mean i like weird, surreal movies, movies when it's very hard for the viewer to separate the reality from the dream, but this movie sucks big time!!And even though i thought it will be at least a horror movie, well i was wrong! In fact ""Succubus"" is NOT a horror movie at all.My advice is: Avoid this at all coasts!!!! Only recommended for those who suffer from insomnia!!!!"
1,BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I bought a copy of this product from a reseeler and it is not working right so i contacted panicware for some help and all i am getting is the run around about where i bought it, almost like they do not want to help because i did not buy it from them.in a e-mail i sent them i told them what it was doing and they responded by saying if you bought it enter the code, but i had told them that did not help so for 4days i have been dealing with them and I still am no further than i was. They are being no help at all."
2,"protects glasses, but very cheap looking.",It would do the job of protecting your glasses if that's all you care about. When I received this case I was very disappointed at how cheap it looked. Seemed to be constructed of cardboard.
2,Alice Cooper....What?,"This DVD gives credit to Alice Cooper, as a big fan of Alice, I bought it as soon as I seen it advertised. I haven't been this disappointed since I received socks for Christmas. Alice had a very small part in this DVD of short scary stories. Very disappointed. Some of the stories weren't too bad but buyer beware. If you do purchase don't buy it thinking it is about Alice Cooper."
3,"If you want a third or fourth book to learn kanji, you should consider this one","Learning kanji? This book has one thing going for it. On a page spread you get kanjis that are related to each other. This can help reinforce learning.I would not recommend this book to learn the kanji. Have written some reviews on which books I prefer. See my page. I would also not recommend this book to look up kanji. Using the web and Microsoft IME (or similar) is just so much quicker).So why three stars? Well, it has one unique feature. It all depends on how many book you want to by. I would personally not bother, but I do have the same book for Chinese Characters and it is helpful for memorisation to see related characters together on one page.Choice is yours."
5,a great find!,"I found this great talent at Itunes as a ""people who bought so & so also also bought..."" I've bought 2 of her cds & love them both! She has a beautiful voice & great lyrics. I'm looking forward to more from her."
1,SHOULD HAVE SAVED MY MONEY!!!,"If you are able to access this review on the internet, you probably know just about everything this book has to tell you. It is SOOOO basic that it is truly for the internet NOVICE. You might glean a few nuggets of information, but I found 99.8% of the book to cover stuff I already knew. I was looking for some good information on marketing an e-commerce site, but beyond suggesting registering with search engines and gently dropping your name in newsgroups, there was almost nothing!!Another minor problem: the book was written in Britain, which is okay, except that most of the examples of web sites given are for British lottery sites, etc.The only good thing to say is that the book is short, so if I was going to be wasting my time, the wasted time was limited!!I would spend my money elsewhere if I had to do it again. I finished reading the book in an hour, and was thoroughly unimpressed."
3,Cheap Book Quality.,"I was hoping for a quality of book that I can read and reread for practice for a long time. The paper was dry and dark, like a recycle quality. The print was light and small. It was not easy on the eyes."
3,California's best kept secret,"As with most great live bands, the true essence of Jackpot's music cannot be conveyed in a recorded format. However, their latest release ""weightless"" comes pretty close, especially on the slower numbers. A much more cohesive album than their last offering ""Boneville"", ""weightless"" is a collection of finely crafted American songs that readers of ""No Depression"" will love. ""Whiskey"" gets my vote for the best song of 1999-2000. Likes its namesake, that song is the sickness and the cure! However, the album as a whole tends to drag a bit. Rusty Miller is an incredible songwriter and the rest of the band is top-notch, but I just wish they would have produced a more diverse collection of songs that better represents their infectious live shows. Still, well worth the money and definitely a band to keep an eye on. If Jackpot is playing near your home, it is your duty as an American music lover to go ckeck them out."
5,marlene,This book was in better condition than I expected. It is of excellent quality and binding. I was very pleased with this selection and it was delivered within the exact delivery dates. I can add it to my library knowing that it has lasting quality.
5,Inventive and funny,"I'd like to throw in my two cents about Rick DeMarinis: he's a wonderful writer, has been a great influence on me, and many of his best books, sadly, have gone out of print. I highly recommend seeking out the collections many of these stories come from, and the terrific novels ""Year of the Zinc Penny"" and ""The Burning Women of Far Cry."" The new stories in here are as mordantly funny as his old stuff."
1,Waste of money...,"I bought this 13"" skillet about 2 and a half months ago and am very disappointed to find that there are nicks and chips in the inside surface of the pan. I never used any metal implements sharper than a table fork and didnt scrape hard with that, mostly only used a plastic spatula on it. Cleaned only with a Scotch-Brite pad as recommended by the manufacturer.Pan still works fine but I have stopped using it because of the damage to the cooking surface since I don't want to eat the advanced polymer. Plan to send it back to Calphalon with a letter of complaint.I thought these pans were my dream come true, a semi-nonstick pan that would stand up to everyday use without damage-- but it's really not much better than a cheap teflon nonstick counterpart. Don't waste your money!"
5,"""EXCELLENT"" BOOK for ALL!",The recipes are very straight forward and easy to use. The different sauces with multi flavors are excellent......and the Smoked Jambalaya Rice is unmatched! I hope you enjoy the multiflavors found in the book!
2,Looks better than it works,"Looks super cool, right?With bag cleaners, all you have to do is remove the bag and put in a new one. With this, you have to realize the suction isn't working (the barrel will not be close to full). Removing the barrel is easy, but you have to spill everything all over when you open it to dump it. Then, you have to remove & clean the sub filter...very dirty jobs.The brush head is too tight and doesn't drop down to the floor level properly, so the brush isn't even in contact with the floor most of the time.Avoid this until they get the kinks worked out.UPDATEMy wife called their customer service. They said that it wasn't supposed to be stiff and immediately shipped out a (refurb) replacement. It's working fine, though is does have a small bit of stiffness.I'd change to 3 Stars if I could..."
4,A great game for true fans!,"If you liked the movie and liked the books, then you will love this game. You start out in the Shire playing as Frodo. You get to help people in the Shire to keep your purity at it's best. The game features characters that didn't appear in the movie, but they are in the book. That helps with feeling like you're actually carrying the ring through middle earth. Not to give any suprises away, but you'll get to play as two other characters. One of which has the power of magic(Hint), where as the other uses his skills as a warrior(Hint). The game promises to entertain! I suggest it to any fan of adventure/action games."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Seriously. Do yourself a huge favor, rent the game first, and then realize that it must be made by the same people who made the ""Noah and the Ark"" Nintendo game that my father gave me for Cristmas one sad, sad year."
2,This is breaking and its NEW!,My daughter received this puzzle for Christmas from her grandmother. It is only Jan. 18th and the puzzle is breaking. The top of the plywood is breaking away from the bottom so I have had to glue one piece and looks like I will be gluing more very soon. Also the puzzle board is extremely warped. This all is of no surprise to me because I have had little luck with Melissa and Doug products. They either break or the paint chips badly. And all their wood is of poor quality! This will disappoint my child greatly when the puzzle is so damaged that it has to thrown away which will be sooner than later.
3,Not quite an unbiased view,"This book is not for you if you are looking for a basic reference material on Napoleone, as I was. After reading Tolstoy's ""War and Peace"" and Hugo's ""Les Miserables"", I was looking for something about Napoleone to put the whole thing in perspective. This book primarily focuses on the personality and psyche of Bonaparte. Barnett, the author seems to have assumed that the reader is already familiar with the events in Napoleone's life. Napoleone's celebrated military victories eg. at Jena, Austerlitz etc., Barnett attributes to the failings of his opposing commanders who fell to his trap and for all his military reverses he blames Napoleone's personal failings as a general and a commander.Not quite an unbiased view."
2,Not working!,"I wont never buy it again. Shipping an delivery was fine. Product is not good. Its so hard to use it, i would say it doesn't do anything. I used as described on the bottle, but it doesn't soft or remove cuticles."
5,"The main character of the novel,","Leona, is A SHINING REAL WOMAN ! A ferocious Patriot, a FEARLESS WARRIOR ! wife, mother, newspaper lady...The style is impecable, wrriten with such apparent simplicity, A PAGE TURNER, NOT FILLED WITH BORING HISTORICAL DATA BUT WITH FACTS, with battles, blood, guts !THE BEST NOVEL I HAVE READ IN YEARS !!!"
2,Aburrido,"Me costo trabajo terminar de leer este libro.. Lo encontre sumamente aburrido y pesado... La historia, a pesar de bien intencionada, se pierde y la protagonista en todo momento carece de fuerza y caracter.. Por igual, la narracion deja mucho que desear... El tema podria ser bastante interesante, pero la historia se pierde, los personajes son tan esporadicos y ligeros que no alcanzo a compenetrarme con ninguno."
4,people love it,"people love this, they all think its a watch, and a lot of people like it and ask were i got it from, plus it has the magnetic metal to help with the human body and i believe it helps and it looks good"
2,Blair & Lee just aren't Houston & Kane!,"One of the problems with this book is that when I read it I expected it to be as great as its counterpart: TWIN OF ICE. But it just isn't as good. I finished reading it just to see more about the characters from the first book. I suppose my biggest problem was that the heroine, Blair, slept with her sister's fiancee. Also, I was upset that the hero actually didn't know the difference between the sisters! Give me a break! I never felt the same feelings I had for Kane and Houston. Had the characters gotten together in a more honorable way, I could have possibly felt something for them."
3,Mexican Easter Bunnie's Review,"Julia one of the main characters in the story meets a boy named Patrick,one of her later friends, he comes over to her house. He likes the smell of Kechee, wich none of her other friends like. So now he comes over every week end. they decide to do a project for the fair. They buy silk worm eggs, and they buy special leaves for the silk worms to eat from Mr.Dixon. They raise the silk worms for a while. Right before the fair the worms make caccons. Their project is a poster decarated with silk. They only need a little more until they are done. All they have to do is kill one worm, but Julia doesn't want to kill a worm. Patrick and her argue for a while. Then Julia goes home. Patrick E-mails her a couple times about it. Julia gets around to thinking about killing a worm."
1,what happened,i wanted to get my swole on so i ordered 4 tubs for 5 bucks each but recieved an email from amazon saying it was cancelled. what gives? Son i am dissapoint
3,Err-ah I don't Know...,"It's Herbie playing solo piano! how could you not purchase this album? Add the fact that it was not released in the states 'till now and you might think this is a must have.However this is not an essential Herbie album. If you already have ""The New Standard"" and ""1+1"" then you have two better versions of two tunes on this perticular disc.Herbie's treatment of ""On Green Dolphin Street"" is a treat. But that's about it. Herbie's ""Blue Otani"" is definately a filler. If you want to hear good solo blues piano look for Donald Brown.Herbie is unstoppable in a group setting ,but if you want great ""group herbie"" qualities in a solo piano setting try John Hick's "" Live at Maybeck hall"" or any Hank Jones solo album. You'll find similar harmonic, rhythmic, and tone qualities."
3,My third purchase of this greenhouse.,"I need a temporary greenhouse to winter over several backyard plants and this fits the bill. It's the tallest portable I could find anywhere, so it works to cover several 8'+ ornamental trees. Stores well in the off season taking up little room in the garage once collapsed. One portable heater inside keeps it above 45* on all but the coldest Texas winter nights. It will start to breakdown after the 3rd or 4th season of use, but that's not unreasonable for the price."
1,Dome material disintegrates,"After 3 years of having the greenhouse up to protect plants in the mild Texas winters, the dome material is literally disintegrating. It isn't even strong enough to hold a patch. My greenhouse is frayed in 4 different spots, creating holes of a foot or more. The company does not offer replacement material and will not do anything about it since the product is only warrantied for one year. NOT a good buy for the expensive price!"
3,Genius and evil,The story of Myshkin's innocence and trust being confronted with the evil of Rogozhin as they pursue the beautiful Natassa is one of Dostoevsky's major novels. It has the usual Dostoevskyan mix of fascinating strange characters who endlessly dialogue about the meaning of their own lives. I have found it be a far weaker and less interesting book than either 'Crime and Punishment' or 'The Brothers Karamazov'.What disturbed me however in reading it was the anti- Semitic passages. Dostoevsky was a true xenophobic who had words of hatred for all those who were not Russian.This hatred is not however at the center of his work.It is an unfortunate insertion.
3,Cute tambourines!,"While looking for instruments, I came across these cute tambourines, suspicious of the quality, due to the cheap price. After looking at the reviews, I decided to take a risk and purchase 6 of these. I was apprehensive of these because manufacturers often make ""musical toys"" - meaning, they look like instruments, but sound horrible. Luckily, that was not the case with these tambourines. The jingles actually ring quite clear, and the head is loosely tuned. I plan on using these with little ones, because the quality still isn't the best, and the color is bright. However, due the head quality, I won't be surprised if it gets damaged quickly by heavy banging from kiddos! Overall, though, I think these are a great buy for the price."
3,Tambouren,My grand daughter plays with it some times. But to send this $ 2.00 toy and charge double the price to deliver. I want be going to your site again. Found the same item @ Walmart.
5,great price for a tambourine,"This is a great tambourine for children. It is sturdy, sometimes my daughter stands on it and it is fine. Also decent sound and intersting to children. Good addition to my home collection of musical instruments for my little one."
4,GREAT TASTING CEREAL,"I REALLY LIKE THE KASHI OATMEAL BETTER THAN ANY OTHER BRAND! TO ME, IT SEEMS MORE SUBSTANTIAL & I ESPECIALLY ENJOY THE RAISINS' IN IT... LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT. THE PRICE IS CHEAPER ON AMAZON.COM, TOO!"
1,Much bigger than described,"These glasses are described as holding 5-5/8 ounces. A serving of champagne is 4 ounces, so I was excited that I would be able to fill my guests' glasses most of the way while still giving them a reasonable portion.The glasses arrived this morning, and I could tell my looking that they were not 5-5/8 ounces. If you fill one to the brim, it is 8 ounces. I can't imagine how they arrived at the very specific (yet apparently arbitrary) 5.625 number.My two key criteria were that (1) I was looking for a glass that would hold around 6oz and (2) I wanted it to be tall and slender. So, I can only give this glass 1 star. It is tall and fat, and holds nearly 1.5 times as much as they say it does.Other than that, it is as described."
1,Mini door closer is junk.,"The mini door closer I bought is junk. It fell apart with 2 hours of use. It was mostly plastic and pooly made. It's copy of one you can buy at Home Depot for the same price, but the one at Home Depot in all metal and it's made USA. Stay away from this product if want something that will last."
5,Dazzling and instructive,"This book is for the serious jewelry student but even the casual reader could be caught by the amazingly beautiful jewelry in it. The collection consists of Etruscan, Greek and Roman gold jewelry reaching back to the 7th century B.C. and ending around the 3rd century A.D. The text is informative and succinct. The photos are superb. In particular, the technical virtuosity and design elegance of the ancient Etruscans are breathtaking."
4,"Larger than expected, but does what's needed","I think when we first took this out of the box, my wife and I thought it was a good bit bigger than expected (which is why I took off the one star). But now that we've got it set up, we're happy. It looks much neater and more professional than our previous setup, plus it has so many more outlets than the old surge protector did. We also have a cat, and now I think we feel a lot safer when he's wandering behind the TV stand. Overall, I think we're very satisfied."
4,power stripzilla,"This power strip is really big! I had to move my entertainment center foward a bit to get the power strip to fit behind it. Once you have everything plugged in it is really difficult to remove a plug. There is one side plug that is meant to solve this issue. The door retention mechanism is rather weak but if you use it as you should (plug everything in, forget about it) then it works as it should while cutting complexity. You would still need zip/twist ties to organize the cables that are coming out."
2,Good but not the best...,"I bought this item for my fiance' and the directions are very hard to understand we actually had to call the company to get further instructions. The remote sensor is not accurate most of the time, gives wrong temperture readings in and outdoors by a few degrees difference. The forecast display on the main indoor unit is sometimes opposite of what it is outside. Other than that the Atomic Clock works perfectly. If you want a better weather station look elsewhere."
3,3 AND A half,"my least favorite release by them, but still entirably worth owning, it includes several remixes of their recurrent pop song ........... forgot what its called and then the werfen sie auf dem fenster aalbum, or what ever it was called, thats probably incorrect, which came out in the late 80's , one of the last albums they made before they moved into more progresssive, less surreal, and ultimately more coherent territories, although still good. kind of an in between album"
5,one of the hidden treasures of the late 90's electronic,"if you can find a copy of this CD, do yourself a favor and buy it. what a beautiful piece of electronic music, but with interesting and sometimes a bit much guitar.if you like the orb, mixed with perhaps david gilmour of pink floyd, or projects like system 7.....find this CD"
3,Average,"I bought this for the Kindergarten rest time we have each day for Extended Care. It depends on the mood of the children as Roald Dahl since the kids were ""bored"" at first since Dahl's voice is actually not as animated as I thought it would be. However the kids have calmed down a bit and like to listen to him. It's nice to have since they do know the stories but I do wish it was more ""story"" like. If I recall correctly I don't think there is any music in the background either."
2,The first 20 minutes are good,The 4 first parts of this live album is very good. There you can find a mix of the revolutions album. It's almost better than revoulutions itself. Otherwise it is not a very inspiring Live-CD.
1,Lopsided,"I had to return the first set (big and small) and got a second set. They were great with the service, the the second ones were lopsided also."
1,"McDonnell Douglas good airplanes, bad book",Not a very well written book with disjointed and confusing text.Not well organized.I wonder if the writer and editor have any organizational skills at all?Probably a function of a writer/editor having too much self-confidence in there own abilities...
1,Awful,"Words just can't describe how much I hate this song. I like No Doubt, but this song just sucks. Tragic Kingdom is their best album to date. I bought the Return to Saturn cd, and I was very disappointed in it. I only liked 2 songs on that cd. I was going to buy Rock Steady, but somebody warned me not to buy it because it is just like Return to Saturn. I've liked Hey Baby and Hella Good, and I bet that will be the only two songs that I like if I did run out and buy Rock Steady. No Doubt, please return to your roots instead of cranking out this [rubbish]."
5,"Hot, steamy and utterly romantic","This book is the third in a series of fantasy erotic tales from the queens of female erotica. This book contains six short stories, each of which are fantastic in their setting, but including hot, steamy and utterly romantic sex. I love this book, and give it my highest recommendations.By the way, the six authors are Cheyenne McCray, Anya Bast, Diana Hunter, Mary Wine, Delilah Devlin and Sherri L. King. My favorite story is actually the first - Wolf's Law by Cheyenne McCray.(Review of Ellora's Cavemen: Tales From The Temple Iii)"
2,Newline Round Platform Contemporary Digital Bathroom Scale One Thumb Down,"The item came as promised (on time) but it does not weigh consistently. Every time you step on it you will get a different weight. I even used dumbbells to test it (carefully). It would show a 35 lb dumbell at 37.2, 38, 35.1, 36, etc.....you get the idea. It you are really, really fat, this is a great scale because you are probably going to lose a lot of weight if that is your goal, and the scale will reflect this massive weight loss. You aren't going to care about plus or minus five lbs. However, if you are a 5'8"" female and weight 155, you aren't going to know if you lost a few lbs last week because you won't be sure if it is a scale error or if you really lost the weight."
1,"Design flaw causes ""broken on arrival"" status",A poorly designed battery connection caused this scale to be broken on arrival; whether it was broken during manufacture or during shipping is unknown. We returned the product immediately.
3,OK but overprice for what you are getting,"Nothing really bad about the product, but nothing to wow either...just a stuff animal with not much realism or ""character"". It also does stand very well (1 leg not touching the floor), but it doesn't even matter that much since I bought it originally for my 6 lb dachshund as companion...but she took one look at it and could not be more disinterested...probably makes a good companion for lil kids if they like dogs."
1,"albums tracks only, whatta ripoff","Search discogs.com for a list of Schoolly's early, non-LP, non-CD singles. This compilation contains none of them.Such an important artist, such trashy compilations. You know what would be great? Schoolly's first album reissued, with all the early singles as bonus tracks. With the props this guy gets from the likes of Ice-T, and Schoolly's friends in the movie business, you'd think someone could make that happen."
2,I expected more,"I wrote in my review of their first album that Northern State had the same energy and enthusiasm as the Beastie Boys did with Licensed to Ill. Unfortunately, while the Beasties took a giant step forward with Paul's Boutique, the girls decided to maintain the status quo by putting out virtually the same album with a better producer. The songs now sound derivative and tiresome while the final track is downright annoying. I look forward to their next album, but I hope they actually decide to do something with their opportunity."
3,Are you people serious?,"Why would anyone review a band whose CD they didn't own simply because they saw them open up for another band. Once.I'm not trying to generalize, but I'm guessing that Cake fans are not hip-hop fans, so take their ""reviews"" with a grain of salt.I actually own both Northern State CDs and they are both completely enjoyable. I'm not saying they are the best, but they're definitely not nearly as bad as some of these reviewers are making them out to be."
1,Dr. Dre raps your favorite Bar Mitzvah and Chanukah tunes,"This CD is about as offensive as that one would be. There should be a separate category in music stores to put CD's like this one in. It would be alongside Alvin and the Chipmunks, William Hung and Weird Al. Somebody must have had mighty fine connections to get this made. These girls have badly and very pretentiously co-opted a genre of music that is totally alien to where they came from."
3,small toy,"a little bit smaller than i thought. my gf said, it's like a toy... for a 25$ item, it is good enough."
1,Look Elsewhere,"I have been using this poacher daily for a few months now, so I have grown to know all of its flaws. 1. The poacher is too shallow, so it is nearly impossible to get the right amount of water in the boiling pot. Too much water and it boils through the holes on the edge of the poacher, drowning your eggs in water. Too little water and it boils off quickly. 2. The poacher easily rusts, ruining whatever pot was used to boil the water. 3. The poacher increasingly loses its ""non-stick"" properties, leaving difficult to clean egg residue in the pan (spraying Pam does not even work).If you plan on occasionally poaching eggs and want a cheap solution, this should do alright, but if you poach eggs on a regular basis, I suggest getting a real poacher."
2,Makes Ugly-Shaped Eggs,I much prefer the Norpro Non Stick 4-Egg Poacher instead that makes round eggs and works great:See here:Norpro Non Stick 4-Egg Poacher
4,The Winner,"Two other much more expensive egg poacher pans bought recently could not compete with this inexpensive solution because they were so difficult to clean. This one cleans easily, plus it cooks the eggs in 3 minutes flat. A pleasure!"
3,Does an okay job.,"It does what it is supposed to do - sit inside a pan and hold some eggs while they poach. I was a little disappointed with how much the eggs stuck to this poacher, even though i had sprayed it with an olive oil spritzer ahead of time. Given the non-stick coating, it shouldn't need much oil, and I'd prefer not to add even more fat to an already cholesterol-laden food.There are no instructions with this poacher as to how long to steam the eggs, which was also a bit disappointing, so now I'm just playing around a bit to find the right amount of time. Note: 4 minutes gave me pretty solid yolks."
1,threw it away without using,"Direction of use would have helped. My system's probably slower, but guess at least it works."
5,Very Happy with Service and Delivery,I was very pleased with the product condition and the timely delivery of the CD
3,"Works, but needs some modifications","Overall, I like this smoker. I've had mine for approximately two years and it's still going strong.If there is one fault, it's the charcoal box. Simply put....it's terrible. As the other review said, the heat will be smothered by the ash from the charcoal. I put a grate on the bottom of mine and it improved it's performance greatly.I tend to use wood chunks as opposed to charcoal or use real charcoal (no clay fillers etc.) and have had good results. The commercial charcoals are, by and large, are made for use on a grill....not in a smoker.If you are a tinker you can certainly modify the charcoal pan and get good results. Get a grate so the ash will fall below the charcoal instead of smothering it. If you'd rather not bother with that, I understand the gas version works well."
4,"Good food, better price.","I ordered this smoker not too long ago and have used it a few times since i recieved it. it only took about a week to get here and set up took about an hour. obviousely this rig isnt for a professional, but if you are an amature into good smoked meats and BBQ this is definately for you. i only have two noteworthy complaints, but they are outweighed by the good.1. Since the smoker is made of a rather thin metal it doesnt hold the heat in very well. you can get an insulator cover for it, but i just refresh my coals every 2.5 hours or so.2. the charcoal pan eventually smothers the fire because it doesnt allow air to circulate under the coals. this is easily fixed by buying a grate to put over the pan and piling the coals on the grate. buying the grate is the inconvenience. also, a charcoal chimney might be a good buy too.other than those two things, i would recomend this to anyone who likes quality home smoked meats."
2,Misleading Picture,"I just received the smoker this evening, ordered and shipped in 2 days.However, the smoker pictured isn't the one that was sent. Not as many rack variations, water bowl is smaller."
1,the book has not yet reached me!,"The book has not yet reached me, after something like a month...so i give the lowest possible rating - one star."
2,Not the best Scale,"The scale does not come on very easily when you tap it. It is also off by 5 pounds. I have tried many different floors with same result.Looks nice, but not the best of scales."
4,its pretty! :),"works very well. little confused to how to turn it on, because i actually have to drop the end of mine from an inch up or so to turn it on... cant really just tilt it."
3,Turns on only with a healthy stomp,"This is a good looking product and goes well anywhere.However, it's big weakness is that you really have to pound on it to get it started.""Foot stomp"" is an accurate description of what you have to do to turn it on.Our experience is that it won't break, but you have to pound it."
1,Expensive Junk,"This is the worst printer we have ever owned. We have owned many and at times printed hundreds of thousands of pages per year. The red on this printer became disfunctional after the first cartridge. Despite cleaning etc., it never revived. Oh, but it uses plenty of red toner, it just does not come out red on the page. The cartridges are outrageously expensive, and the last time I bought them, the brand new color ones came only half full. Not acceptable for an $80 cartridge. The thing is loud and cycles repeatedly to clean, calibrate or whatever. Then throw in the HP nonsense with their continuous updating and screwy driver jig for more fun.Throw on top of all that that HP now has some of the worst service in the industry, and you have an expensive piece of junk. I am tossing mine when the toner runs out the next time rather than spend over $300 for cartridges. Throwing $1000 in 20s off a bridge would have been a lot more fun."
1,Piece of Junk!,"I have used this printer for 3,128 pages total! It is now rendered more expensive to fix than it is worth. Also, HP embedds microchips into the toner cartridges and they tell you how many prints you will print. After the chips cutt the toner off you may find anywhere from 10% - 40% toner left in the cartridges. I will NEVER BUY another HP Product."
3,It curls paper,"I read many, many reviews of this printer before buying it. I read reviews on Amazon, CNET, HP, and other places and none of them mentioned that it curls the paper when printing double-sided. If I had know that, I wouldn't have bought it. Other than that, it works as advertised."
1,Another HP printer DOA,"I was excited about being able to afford a color laser jet printer...until the HP 2650 printed a grand total of 6 pages and then died (a ""fuser"" problem).This is the second HP printer that has died a premature death on me in 14 months - the other a B&W; laserjet. Working with HP is a real nightmare. When I called I was put on hold for 15 minutes each with a series of customer service reps who could not help me. Finally they said they would ship out a replacement unit within 2 days. 10 days later no printer and I called to see what had happened (they did not ship because they had written down a wrong PHONE number for me!) They said the unit would be shipped out ASAP. It did not arrive until nearly another 10 days had passed. By then I had to buy another printer and just refused delivery on the HP. I would never buy another.My Apple laser printer lasted 8 YEARS with no problems..."
1,worst printer I've ever owned,"This printer is a piece of junk. I was only able to get through the first set of cartridges before problems began. It was a cheap printer, but I thought HP was better than this. They used to have a good reprutation, but this printer proves they've gone down the tubes.I got about 1500 sheets through, when all of a sudden the red cartidge starts not printing correctly. I've noticed on the web that this problem is not unusual. Also the yellow starts printing instead of the red. I tried to get answers from HP, but they are pretending like the problem doesn't exist. Customer service? What customer service? What a joke."
2,Printer with Short Life Span,"Love the duplex and network feature. I bought this printer 2 years ago and it worked great for about six months. Then suddenly it began to fade out on the red color and before long no red, just green and blue. Because of the expense, I waited until I needed a black refill - thinking the red was low though it showed a full red cartridge. Big mistake! I repaced the ink cartridges and expected the printer to work; it did not. So I called HP support and told them the problem. Because I had waited the warrantee was up so all they would do is replace the printer with a refurbished and no guarantee it would last any longer, at a cost of about $300. Now I use it as a B&W printer and that works okay."
2,Used HP Color LaserJet 2605dn Printer,"Printer will not print the color red. All other colors print very light, not dark and bold as with our old printer of this exact same model."
1,Don't Buy This Printer!,"After the warranty ran out a serious problem emerged. The magenta cartridge stopped printing properly. Virtually everything I print in color looks faded. I've replaced the cartridge twice, to no avail. I googled the problem and learned that many, many other people have the same problem. HP is aware of the problem but does nothing."
4,Compatibility description is misleading,"I just installed this printer and it works very well on the network. Installation was a snap. The information you can see in HP Toolbox FX is very comprehensive (compared to any other printer I used in the past).The only issue I have is that in the description, it says that the printer is compatible with Windows 98SE, but the installation software is only for Windows 2000/XP. HP Online did not have any Windows 98SE downloads either for this printer, so as far as I know, it is not Windows 98SE compatible (contrary to what is mentioned in the description). If anyone managed to install it on Win98SE, I would like to know how. Other than that, it's a great printer."
4,Finally - An Easy-to-Use Planning Tool,"Having been in business continuity for many years, I've been looking for easy-to-use tools for developing emergency plans and related documents. Typically these tools can range into the tens of thousands of dollars. Mr. Hiles' book presents real value for money. The product is well organized and provides a complete package for novice and professional alike. People seeking a cost-effective tool to help with developing a business continuity plan should consider this product."
2,"Wrong key, no one plays these songs on piano","This book is good for the lyrics and melody lines. However they are not in the key ofthe recordings and include chords that Mr. Cash never used dim chords.Also , in classic Hal Leonard style, the songs are written for piano. Who play's thesesongs on a piano? They should offer this book for guitar with tabs. Or maybe they have and I couldn't find it."
1,"No, no, no, a thousand times NO!","Customer Service is HORRID! Been two weeks and can't get them to replace the propane hoses which are too short to reach the tank. Looks nice, but... No rotisserie even made to fit this grill. Be prepared to wait on hold forever if you need to call them! Good quality Stainless Steel is NOT magnetic."
4,I WEAR THEM DAILY FOR WORK........,".....and they are very comfortable, Quality seems to be better than the last Unlisted shoe I purchased elsewhere. Haven't polished them yet so I can't say anything about that."
3,Too Creepy for Me,"I fell asleep with cable tv on and when I woke, this movie was on the screen, in oneof it's most horrific moments. I changed the channel FAST and then checked to see the title so that I would never inadvertently watch it.Creepy.....too creepy for me.So, if you're reading this, you're looking for horror. This might be right up your alley."
3,Decent,A nice little meditation CD. I've heard better but this does the job if you're just looking for something relaxing and subtle.
5,Great for a massage room,"My husband and I have a ""spa room"" with a massage table in our vacation home. This CD is great for massages! It's just like what you hear when you go for a massage. Very relaxing."
5,Great cd,I play this cd in my treatment room while I give my clients facials and they love it. It's very relaxing and soothing to listen to.
3,Sad Music,"I like the sounds of Asian instruments and also appreciate that it does not have digital sounds. Yes, the music is calming, but I also find it a little sad. I don't know; maybe it's just me (?)"
5,Otherworldly,This is a collection of poetry that inspires and frightens. Gwen is truly a magician and a mystic with words. She explores mysticism and the depths of the psyche in each poem. This is definately a must-have for any poetry buff.
4,Great book for middle school,"I purchased 2 copies of this book as my daughter had required reading for 7th grade. My intent was to be able to discuss the book with her, so we read the book 'together'. While I admittedly was not excited to be reading a teen book, the premise of the story was interesting and kept my attention. The books talks to friendship, values, and many things children in this age group encounter. It was an enjoyable, hard to put down book. My daughter has now asked for the second book in the series and I'll probably steal it after she has finished."
3,A little small,"I purchased this pack for day hiking in the mountains. It is well made and has ample pockets and storage for power bars, gps, phone, first aid kit, water and more. The only drawback for me is that I am large framed and it is a little small. Would be great for someone in the 5'-5"" to 5'-8"" and around 135-175 lbs."
4,Has worked well for me for 2 yrs now,"very inexpensive way to let me know someone has entered our driveway area. I live in the country and have a long driveway, I placed this sensor near my garage and it tells me when someone enters our driveway either by car, bike, or foot. I was worried that it wouldnt work as advertised due to the cheap price, but it has done well. Only reason why I do not give it 5 stars is that it does go off on windy days when a nearby tree moves in the wind."
1,Driveway sensor,After using this product for one year the lens is faded and obscured and is not sensitive to motion any longer. Batteries wear down quickly.
4,Judith does it again.,"I love listening to Judiths voice.I dont think i would pay much attention to these songs if anyone else sung them.She has an ability to reach out with true emotion in her voice.Here is a a very good CD.Some of the songs have been co-written by her late husband Ron Edgeworth.But most songs have been penned by herself.The Cd i have gives a description of each song and where she got the particular songs from.She appears to have put together a collection of songs from here and there and pieced it together,and forming an exceptional cd."
4,Worked great!,"I received it just before my trip, so I tested it on my Southwest flights. Southwest, for me, tends to have the loudest noises, always giving me a headache afterwards. The earphones fit perfectly - they do provide different sizes but the default one worked for me - and canceled out the plane noise, and for the first time, I didn't suffer from a headache. Also, it's lightweight and easier to carry compared to the headphone versions. Great performance for the price."
4,Good Quality for the Price,"These ear buds are good quality for the price. The quality is not diminished too much when the noise cancelling feature is turned on. I can still hear some outside noise, but when I use the ear buds to listen to an audiobook I do not notice the outside noise very much and it still will lull me to sleep at night. Yes, it is not as good as Boise, but who can afford Boise?When I do not use the noise cancelling feature the quality of music is excellent. With the noise cancelling feature there is some ambient noise, but soon you do not notice it and the quality of sound is still very good.I also appreciate that Sony include several sizes of ear plugs for the buds. It seems that I use a different size in each ear! Also if more than one person uses the ear buds, then they can put on their own clean plugs."
4,Surprisingly good,"I use these mostly for listening to talks and movies in planes and car trips (as well as other noisy places). Although, alot of noise canceling is passive, I do notice a significant change when I turn on the active noise canceling. Normally, I would have the computer (when watching a talk) at full volume, with these headphones I listen at 55-70%. I have used them at the gym listening to music, they sound good (not excellent). If you are an audiophil you would want something better. For me (and my use) they work great. Specifically, that I can listen to my dvds and other videos on my computer and iphone while traveling without blasting the sound."
3,Average,"I purchased these prior to a transatlantic trip. They are fairly average earbuds. I am not sure they are worth the extra cost. I can tell little difference when I turn on the noise canceling feature on the airplane. I did try it with the different size ear cushions. Another problem is losing the ear cushions. They have come off twice, even when carefully seated on the ear bud. I had trouble locating replacements, but good old Amazon came through. Another 14 bucks including shipping."
3,"Good Sound, but Hard to Store and Batteries Die Quickly","The sound quality for these earphones is very good. Two things to be aware of before you buy, both related to storage. 1) The earphones ship with a little pouch to store them in. Unlike other ear buds there is no way to wind-up or easily store the cord. As a result it will get easily tangeled when stored. 2) The on/off switch for the noise cancelling function is easily triggered when stored. As a result, the batteries run down. I frequently pull out the earphones to find the batteries dead and the noise cancelling function not working."
4,french virginia woolfe?,"I see huge similarities and would love to know what effect Woolfe had on Sarraute:But dry? Not on your life.Look at the thoughts of the aunt as she sits down to write: she takes on the whole world with each word.The young man at the party may be pompous, but his desire to lead his listeners ""into the forest"" with him, is touching: have you never tried to explain something that meant everything to you only to hear ""pass the chardonnay please"".The doorway described at the beginning of this book is a doorway to the psychologies of the characters, not the words they speak, but the .00001 second of motivation that CAUSES them to say what they do...and if you examine any character in this light they, we, will be dramatic.So I did find this book conducive to entertainment, just in a completely different way...."
5,Why Can You Give Only 5 Stars??,"This is a magnificent performance by singers the like of whom we will never see again. At the end of the performance, the ladies in the audience threw - not flowers - but their jewelry at Franco Corelli. When you hear this recording, you will know why. Bottom line - buy several."
3,Not a Real Reggae Album,"First of all, half of the songs on this album are barely even what I'd consider Reggae. All this album basically is made up of is hits that border on Reggae and overcommercialized hits. If you are a true fan of Reggae, save your money."
4,Good gut not that good,The entire sound track is in French with English subtitles. It's a movie about betrayal and murder. I'm only about half-way through so I'll finish my review later.The main reason that I bought this video is that Masha Gonska plays Catherine. She also played Greta in Good as Gold (AKA: the American Success Company with Jeff Bridges).
5,AT LAST!!!,This series is a great way to go from early contact through events that happened in relatively recent history. Don't miss this!
2,Cheaper not always the way to go,"Name brand items are sometimes just that, just a name but other times, it is worth the money.This is one time that I should have gone name brand or better quality. For the price, I know I was getting a bargain but it did not work out that way.The filters are sold in a case of 12 but you may have to use one a week because it is see through thin. I actually use 2 a month but know I should change more often. Spend the money!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I was sorely disappointed after tracking down this CD, and discovering that it's not even the right band! I was expecting that it would at least be categorized right on this site, and I would be receiveing an album by the INDUSTRIAL band Battery.On the other hand, to anyone who desperately needs a fix for some garage-band metal, this is your CD. Want to buy my copy?"
3,TOXIC MOLD LITIGATION,"This book is skimpy on legal analysis. It discusses seven cases in the eight pages devoted to legal analysis. There is no attempt to write an exposition of tort theories that have been applied, merely a brief of the cases. I exected more legal analysis than the book provides. The strength of the book is discussion of experts."
2,Seriouly Disappointed,"First off let me say when buying a video from BOOZ Ent you basically know what your going to see, a black version of girls gone wild. This is the kind of stuff BET should've had on BET uncut.There is only one way to describe this DVD, biggest let down ever. I decided to buy this Dvd after seeing a preview of it on another BOOZ Ent video, and thought it would be a little more explicit. To my surprise it was all censored. Nothing but blue dots and fuzzy shots. I spent most of my time fast forwarding.Most of BOOZ's movies I've seen aren't this censored, maybe there is a uncensored version somewhere, but if there is this is not it. Bottom line only get this DVD if you're certain it is uncut & uncensored."
4,Good value,"Nothing fancy, but good for every day wine glasses. If your wife breaks wine glasses as often as mine, these will work."
2,Overpriced,Ridiculously overpriced. The company doesn't respond to e-mail. Compare to Alcon Unisol or other lower priced brands.
1,"Doesn't work in urban areas, I keep getting static.","The low frequencies (<90 MHz) seem to be tied up in Seattle. I have a XM radio that can also transmit FM at the higher frequencies (106.5>), and that works much better. Stay away from this product, buy something that can do both the low and the high frequencies."
1,Lack of service parts,"I have been trying for several months to get service parts for my Alltrade compressor. I have a different model then this, but it is the same service department for all. They are good if they work, but good luck trying to fix an AllTrade compressor."
4,Pharmacy Practice and Law,"This is a fairly easy to read text that is helpful in preparing for the pharmacy boards. It provides essential coverage of pertinent information needed in the everyday practice of pharmacy.As a pharmacy intern I found this text not only excellent for board review but also as a continuing source for reference as a pharmacist. It is divided into varioius chapters with relavent and useful case studies. It also raises day-to-day ethical questions in the practice of pharamcy that you may encounter.If you're looking for a comprehensive, easy-to-follow book on pharmacy practice, both in hospital and retail based environments, then this is the book for you."
1,New cruchier formula tastes like burnt cardboard,"Awful!!! I used to love TLC crackers. This new formula had left the worst taste in mouth. These aren't crunchier, they just taste bitter, dusty and are hard to swallow. I'm so sad because these were our go-to crackers for everything. I'll never by another box of these unless they go back to the old formula. I wish I could get my money back."
3,Boosie?,If your lookin for a cd that only has two boosie tracks on it...Then you've found it! That's right only two songs with boosie...Save your money and buy bad azz when it hits stores.
2,How did Franz Kafka get so thin?,"This was a real disappointment. They have retained none of their charm, their too-clever-by-twice songkraft, and their compelling instrumentation. Dagmar's voice may still be Dagmar's voice, but that's about all that remains of the peak Slapp Happy of the early 70s. As a practicing allergist, I feel compelled to warn anyone allergic to unfocusedness and sweaty Limburger cheese: DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM. As for the rest of you, you wouldn't know the difference if it slapped you in the kisser with a sandshark..."
4,Very enjoyable.,"I read this book after visiting Cedar Rapids and Brucemore. I enjoy historical places and this book made Brucemore ""come to life"" for me. It gives the reader a good look at life of the upper class in the first half of the twentieth century. The author also has a good sense of humor and makes the reading fun and educational. I loved reading about all the modes of transportation available to those who could afford it. On the whole, I enjoyed this book very much."
5,Best treatment out there,This treatment is worth every penny. Easy to use applicator and the treatment starts working right away. I have been using this product for a few years now and won't use anything else.
4,All you wanted to know about Roswell....,"Fans of the TV show, Roswell,- formerly on the WB, now playing in syndication on Sci Fi channel, will not be disappointed in this book .It is an indepth viewer guide that has a list of actors/their bios, the history of the show and episode guide for all 3 seasons. A nice bonus is the chapter on the fans and how they impacted the show with their campaigns, letter writing and loyalty. Also included is a brief outline of the events of the real Roswell Incident that occured in 1947 in New Mexico.For fans of the show and those that have seen the episodes, this is a nice guidebook to give you more info."
3,"Great movie, if my copy wasn't damaged.",Recieved this DVD and popped it in to watch it. I was very happy with my purchase until I reached the end of the DVD and found out that two of the chapters wouldn't play. Each chapter is a different story. So I couldn't watch the entire movie. Very unpleased.
5,Sobering information,"So glad there are people who bravely fight against this terrible crime and human abuse. The film was professionally done, included many stars and famous people. Very touching and extremely informative. It will make you want to act in some way to help those who are caught in the human and sex trade."
3,The Book was better,This does not follow the book. I enjoyed the book much more. But it is interesting for those who don't read books.
3,Mildly Disappointing Game,"I really enjoyed BG2 but this expansion just did not have everything it should have. Mostly it lacked in story and dialouge, being just a hack and slash type of game, that did not take very long to beat.Experience cap is ridiculous, my best character was not even close to a cap when the expansions ended, also the last villain was not even half as challenging as Irenicus was.On a brighter note, I think Pool of Radiance and Neverwinter Nights will be incredible games of a higher quality than Baldurs Gate was.mt"
3,"A so so ending, to an incredible series","Let me start off by saying that Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn is the best game I've played in 8 years. Perhaps that is why this expansion pack is a little disappointing. It was a good expansion pack, but is a let down after BG2:SoA. The limitations of the D&D system can be seen in this game. There really isn't much to get you excited about when your characters are already of near god-like status (level 20+). You just keep getting more and more magic, abilities, and magic items - making them seem almost boring and commonplace, when they should be amazing and wondorous. If you loved BG2, then you should get this game, it is fun and worth the money - but don't expect the level of fun that BG2 gave."
3,I thought Icewind Dale was the Dungeon Crawl,"Ok, most of my gripes about this game come from me being a D&D player. First of all, the max levels you can get in D&D is 30, not 40, and if you're level 40 pretty much the only thing that can hurt you is a god. There were probably a couple hundred mortals in this who could beat you down. Where the heck did they come from? It seems like they gathered every mortal in the .0000005% of the population over level 10 and put them in one region!Now, a non-D&D gripe, the first 2 BG games were good because they offered a few multiple ways of solving quests. In ToB all there was was dungeon crawling and fighting. They turned the BG series into an action game! Its supposed to be an RPG!! Anyway, if you like hours of fighting unrealistic enemies go for it. If not, pass. Its still fun, just not even close to the first 2.Lets put it this way. All bhaalspawn have cool powers, its just that yours is to gain 60,000 experience for picking up a rock."
5,eat up!,"Romaine Parris lettuce is fantastic. It's so good you can actually eat it right out of the bag! Yes that's right- you don't always have to make a salad out of lettuce. There's no rule that says you have to eat lettuce with dressing and combine it with other vegetables. I've always believed that eating lettuce the way it's presented is the healthiest and most pleasurable way to enjoy it. Not that I don't like eating salads occasionally. I don't want to contradict myself here since I just wrote a review for Italian Robusto salad dressing. It's just that, you know, lettuce by itself is sometimes the perfect way to munch on a healthy food. Anyway sorry for the little ramble there. I tend to do that. Just make sure you get your fill by indulging in some fantastic lettuce. Romaine lettuce is the way to go for the best in nutrition, enjoyment and a perfect snack."
2,There are better options,"While my son enjoys looking at himself in this mirror, it really shouldn't be used on the floor since it's not very sturdy. It can be attached to a crib instead."
2,Less than pleased,"I ordered an extra large in this ""women's"" shirt. The shirt fits my 14 year old daughter with only a little growing room to spare. (My daughter wears a size 3.) I admit, it was too much trouble to return the item, so I will probably hang on to it until I find someone I can give it to."
5,Guitar looks like new!,This kit brought my Gibson Explorer back to life! I was very surprised how badly my guitars needed to be cleaned up and this stuff did a great job. Very satisfied with this product.
1,Trotskyite falsification of history,"Trotsky, objectively an enemy to socialism who allied with the Nazis against the USSR, apparently has no idea what he is talking about. Among all the lies and exaggerations are some facts too, but he interpretes them in an obviously tendentious manner and takes every mistake Stalin did as a proof of his counter-revolutionary character. For example. The 30's saw an increased productivity because of the need to prepare for the fascist war. Trotsky sees in this nothing else than an exploitation of the workers! I won't waste more of my time now, but it's also interesting to note that Trotsky actually says that under SOCIALISM, there will be no state! And also that the formula ""By each after ability, to each after work"" is NOT valid under socialism. A man who so completely has misunderstood the fundaments of Marxism can not be taken seriously."
3,Parts keep breaking,"I own a Ronco pasta maker . When I use it I love it. The only problem is the parts keep breaking. I think that I will start to look for a pasta maker with parts that may be stronger. Yes it is true that pasta is easy to make with the ronco, but that does not help me when I am in the middle of making pasta and it breaks again. Maybe Ronco should advise people to have a bag of store bought noodles for when parts crack and break. I would understand if I used the machine alot, but it might get used once a month.So I have used it a total of no more than 26 times and I need to replace a part for the second time. The parts are not cheap and I paid [quite a bit of money]. for the machine in Canadian funds. This breakage does not happen from wrong mixture of dough because it does come out easily. I guess I'm on the hunt for another pasta machine."
2,Should've known,"I purchased mine at a retail store at a typical ""as seen on tv"" discounted price and returned it within a couple days. The ""locking ring"" that held the mixer in its place broke in half after the first use. I could have purchased the part through Ronco's website for $7.00 + S/H (for a molded plastic ring!), but if it broke on my first use (and I followed the recipe in the booklet carefully), it'll surely break again - not very economical or convenient.Thankfully, the retailer was happy to give me a refund."
2,Broken Hearted Pasta Maker,"We love this machine, but it continually breaks down. The plastic parts are too brittle for the pressure that this pasta maker places on them. We have waited many times for parts, and we have waited too long on the service line needing help.Look for another machine that uses steel or metal parts that won't crack, chip or snap when making the machines pasta recipes. Best to you!"
1,Standard Headphone,I bought this exact model of headphone at the local drug store today cause my old JVC wide driver DJ style set where wore out. They're just standard small driver/speaker phones with a typical frequency response of 20-25000.My suggestion is spend a little more on something with a wider speaker for more frequency response; especially in the bass range. Turtle beach makes a DJ quality noise canceling headset for 80 bucks that has excellent frequency response and construction. Headphones like these are garbage quality with bold letter gimmicks; they are the same as the dollar store set.Sound quality is worth an investment for a heavy use item that will last some years.
2,deck cushion,Cannot not use on to protect cushions against rainy weather. It leaks & items inside get wet. Zipper seems poorly made. Would not purchase again.
3,Oversized,"I wasnt expecting these to be huge. These are huge and not suitable if you have small dining table / area to put them on. Too big, stores way too much product, I felt like I could fit a full size pepper can from Walmart into it. Serves the purpose though. One thing they do look expensive."
4,"A bit large, a bit slow","I like the look of these shakers. They are a bit larger than I imagined - heavier, too. I would prefer more holes since the salt seems to come out pretty slow compared to other shakers I have. Other than that I'm happy with them."
1,Chinese,"I bought a new FRAM G3802A in-line gasoline filter last year to replace a 12-year-old OEM gas filter on a 1996 Mercury Sable. The OEM filter was still working, but way past due for replacement, with 120,000+ miles on it.Well, the Fram gas filter only lasted 10 months and self-destructed, or collapsed inside of the metal filter casing blocking the flow of fuel.Since I have been buying Fram filters for years with good results, I was very puzzled.Checking further, and it is now stated as such on the boxes that the new Fram filters come in, I found that they are now manufactured IN China.That explains the collapse."
1,Do not buy from Pretec if you have WinXP,"I bought a Pretec DC - 800 from Amazon. The camera works fine. It even used to upload to my computer. It no longer does. I upgraded to WinXP and the camera is not compatible with WinXP. In fact, looking on the Pretec website I found not one single camera that said it was WinXP compatible.I have tried numerous times to contact Pretec and find if a WinXP driver is in the works, or if I will have to get a different camera. I have yet to receive a responce.That tells me that Pretec wants only to sell its wares and let the buyer beware.So, if you have WinXP or ae planing to upgrade to it, I would advise you to stay away from Pretec products."
4,Thumbs up for Berlinger & Sinofsky,"A very good documantery abot the perils of judging a book by it's cover and a legal justice system gone astray. The three films prove that human failure is everywhere possible, but that in certain fields it proves disastrous for all people involved. They also make you think about capital punishment (I'm pro, not against), but if the state ends a persons life, their should be no doubt about if his guilty or not. And as you can see in these movies, the circumstances under which the three were convicted where far from clear. So well done Mr. Berlinger and Mr. Sinofsky for helping these three individuals for getting, at long last, their well deseved freedom."
3,Decent survey/reference book,"I was greatly disappointed with the first edition of this book. There is nothing new herein that cannot be culled from the latest presentations/whitepapers posted on NVIDIA/ATI websites, from the standpoint of real time graphics.That being said, the book in conjunction with the book's online resources site is pretty much a stand alone reference on the state of the art in rendering techniques today."
5,Excellent Book,"This is a great book. It features in depth coverage of all areas of graphics programming of interest to game programmers,"
3,Don't expect too much....,"Well, this books covers almost all important chapters that are needed in an Algorithm course. However, detailed explainations of algorithm analysis is totally insufficient, only one or two pages are used to explain the algorithm/theory. You can always find this book too dry for large block of words printed on a whole page -- that's scaring"
2,I read it since i want to pass an exam :),"First,there are some mistakes in the code supplied with the book,i'm sure Prof. Weiss have already fixed these in the second edition. Second,there MUST be at least answers to the excercises ,i'm not begging for solutions.Third,i'd prefer some other book,like Knuth's,but this one is good enough to pass the exam :),and the thery is described in short and understandable way.To be improved in further editions."
3,Good show,As a teen I watched Absolutely Fabulous on tv. Now I am an adult. I looked up A.F. on Amazon. Didn't think I was going to find it. But there it is. I am now a proud owner of A.F.While watching the special features on A.F. they said first came French and Saunders. I never heard of French and Saunders before. I didn't watch BBC a lot here in America. I am a dvd collector. So before watching French and Saunders on tv I went ahead and ordered this collection.I just finished watching the collection and I thought it was funny. I enjoyed it. But there were some scene's I didn't find funny. Maybe because they made a joke of the BBC show's. Since I haven't seen many of them I didn't get the joke. This rating is how I feel about this show. You might feel different if you've seen a lot of BBC shows.
2,Recipe book only,"the first 90 pages are brief, and I mean BRIEF, descriptions of smoking BBQ but with no real directions on what or how to do it. Low and Slow is a much more informative book on the how-to's of smoking food.The rest of the book is basically a bunch of recipes so if that's what you're looking for its fine but skip the first 90 pages."
2,"Some good references, but not much for the beginner.","Not a good first book for smokers; this book provides precious little information for the beginning smoker. While the author starts off with basic information, he quickly skips to advanced recipes. There are very few basic recipes for the beginner found on these pages. I also find the author to be a bit jaded and unwilling to accept any methods of cooking other than his own.If you're a curious cook who likes to start with some basic guidelines and go from there, this book is not for you. If you are an experienced smoker looking to pick up a few new recipes, you may benefit from this book."
3,It is...OK,I was slightly dissapointed when I received this book. It was a gift for my son. I expeted it to be a bit larger; in size and thickness. The information does seem to be good which is most important.
1,Just as bad as his other book I read.,"This one was given to me to read. Just like one I had purchased, this book is also filled with typos and grammar errors.I would skip this author and pick just about any other book by any other author."
4,A book for the experienced,"This is a good book and some of his recipes are good to excellent, but it is for the experienced smoker, not for the beginner. He also mentions non-charcoal (electric, gas) smokers in passing but never talks about it in any detail.Yes, Dorothy there are serious non-charcoal smoke enthusiasts out there."
3,This is not Eric Avery's Band:this is just a jazz band,"This is not the Eric Avery's band called Polar Bear:this is just a jazz band with the same name,coming from UK.I gave three stars but I didn't listen this band."
4,Lovely luxury bath bubbles,Ordered this for my daughter's birthday. It is lovely and she was very pleased with it but it is a bit expensive for an 'every-day' bath product in my opinion.
4,Great Fun For Everyone!,"Charles Busch's roman a'clef novel is great, great fun. A theatrical backstage romp, similar in style to Armistead Maupin's ""Tales Of The City"" series. Though not as much fun as seeing one of Busch's incomperable live performances (He is a truely brilliant comic actor, one of the most skilled I've ever seen!) it is still a joy from begining to end, and surprisingly touching as well. You can't spend time better than in the company of Mr. Busch. I'm buying extra copies to give to my friends, becuse I'm sick of loaning out mine!"
1,Grinding more like it.,"I did get the ring on the 1st good job on that. Poor craftsman ship, fits my finger but as for my new kitchen sink bling. What a waist. Not really recommended. Well see what happens."
3,"I loved it, he hated it!","According to my hubby, the sizes feel small. He does say that since it's a spinner ring, you can't get a solid grip on it to twist it off (he likes his rings to fit snug). So it got stuck on his finger a couple times and he hasn't worn it since. I have owned spinner rings before and I never had the problem that he had, but I also have smaller fingers. I could see how, on chunkier fingers, it would be difficult to remove it."
5,Great Rpg,this game was made for the true rpg players that like to spend hours playing. this game also lets you create your party with unique characters. this game lets you play for months without stop. this game new personality settings are great i enjoy all of the comments the character provide.
4,I Love It!,"I love this game! In the beging of it, it seams tricky, but once you get used to the controls, it's really easy. Some things in the game, like jumps, seam imposibal. But actuly the game makes things look harder then it really is. It dosen't give you much direction, but you don't need it, because if you hit the sense botton (R2) it tells you were to go. I also love this game because Halle Berry's voice is in it. It goes with the story line Of the movie. Like who killed Pateince, and why."
3,Catwoman game,"My daughter told me recently that she didn't like this game, when I asked her why she said that the game didn't make sense. Maybe the game is just over her head....? Nothing against the game she just didn't care for it."
2,Too bright and too fast!,"As others have already commented, this clock is way too bright to keep lit in your bedroom while you sleep. Even on the lowest light setting it will light up your entire room. Yes, you can turn the light off, but if you do that you cannot see what time it is in the dark.I've tolerated this for the past few months because I like the idea of this clock - that is, being able to use with my ipod and I like the size and design, and the sound quality of the speakers are very good, but a new problem has occurred and that is the clock gains time at the rate of about one minute per week. I'm not sure if this is just a defect in the unit I have or if others are like this.I'm now on Amazon searching for a new clock. I'll keep this one and just use it as a speaker for my ipod, but definitely not in the bedroom."
3,Just OK,"This device is simply ""ok."" It lacks a lot of features found on better iPod alarm clocks. My daughter wanted something simple and loved the pink color, so I bought it for her. Works well for what it does. Sound quality is fairly bland."
1,No radio! Amazon search results are incorrect.,"It does NOT have a radio! I bought this after searching for an ""iPhone clock radio"". Although it comes up in Amazon's search results, it does not come with a radio. All you can use it for is your iPod/Phone."
1,Worked fine for 2 days then DEAD.,"Okay, so I was all excited about having an iPod docking station/alarm clock for the bedroom.... easy to set up, easy to program, came with all kinds of attachments for various iPods.Working fine for 2 days then just died. checked power outlets, ports, settings, troubleshooting manual, looked online for tips, etc... nothing worked. just dead in 48 hrs of use.just cant make a good recommendation on it, sorry!"
5,this was a gift,bought this for my niece and she loves it. i can't comment on sound quality but she has had no problems with it.
2,I Home,"Not a bad product, however the biggest complaint is the i pod does not sit well in the i home. We had to use a piece of paper wedged in behind the i pod to steady the i pod and keep it charging."
1,A complete waste of money.,"I bought this ihome clock radio for my daughter for Christmas. She used it less than a week before the speakers just stopped emitting sound. I have tried calling the ihome technical support line multiple times, but it always disconnects. After reading other reviews here, I am thinking I am better off just cutting my losses and starting with a more reliable product from a more reliable company."
5,Encompassing and probing,"A book of its time (60s-early 80s), but I'm glad I finally came to it. Generally it contrasts the theories and practices of western innovators (Stanislavski et. al., Brecht, Grotowski, Brooks) against the rituals and traditions of eastern institutions (Kathakali, Noh, Kabuki, ritual events of Bali, India, especially Ramlila). Fascinating diagrams accompany the discussion of performance theory. Loved the essays on performance in ""Restoration of Behavior,"" and ""Transported and Transformed."" And for both the actor and director, the argument that performance exists somewhere between the ""not-me and not-not-me"" is compelling."
1,PS1?,wow ps1 sucks! Go get ps2 then buy this game for the ps2. cuz the p21 has horrible graphics and i cant believe their still making games for the ps1.
4,Cuts like a knife,"Serated is the way to go. Be careful because you can chip it and if you slice things on top of a Correlle plate, the plate can mysteriously crack in half just like glass cutters cut glass."
2,If you read back issues of Automobile and Car and Driver ...,"I'm a fan, and the book was a welcome trip down memory lane. But I wouldn't recommend the book to someone who isn't a David E disciple like me. The Man edits terrific magazines, but his columns need the context of the rest of the magazine (i.e., they're not very interesting on their own). They don't make a great compilation. I also think the columns lose a lot by omitting graphics.If we could get Patrick Bedard or Peter Egan to produce a compilation (or put The Fastest Funny Car back in print)..."
2,Getting STRONGER with each release.,"With the inclusion of 'multiple projecting and internet viewing' MS has made some mojor advances. Two other needs are ""Backward Pass and Multiple Resource Calendars"". With these included MS Project will have achieved a ""strong contender"" status with some of the strongest and most expensive project management systems at a very affordable price structure."
2,Paisan,"Wait for a new transfer. The rating is for the mediocre HSV 1987 videotape of this powerful film. The print is contrasty, and the transfer so careless that the last half hour of the film is missing!"
2,Does Not Include Traditional Characters!!,"Hi-Nothing fundamentally wrong with this book or its contents, except it DOES NOT INCLUDE TRADITIONAL CHARACTERS.Unlike Schaum's Outlines, Chinese Grammar (which includes both simplified and traditional characters), this book does not.This is a serious shortcoming, which should be indicated plainly in the publisher's/Amazon's description of the book."
5,Great for building advanced vocabulary,"This book is an outstanding vocabulary builder for those studying Mandarin Chinese. It would be very helpful for intermediate students. It is not meant for beginners since it is assumed the student can read and understand basic Chinese sentences. It does not have a section on Chinese grammar, which would have to be learned from some other source.The book has many chapters, each dealing with a particular subject. Sample chapters include ""At the Restaurant"", ""The automobile"" with detailed vocabulary words for such things as the gas pedal, clutch, neutral gear, etc., a sports chapter with vocabulary for basketball, tennis,etc. and even a chapter on computers with words such as Pentium (Benteng), hard disk (yingpan) and floppy disk (ruanpan). There are exercises at the end of each chapter with the answers provided at the end of the book.I found this book very helpful for building vocabulary that goes beyond the usual basic beginning grammar book."
5,A Musician's Guide To The Work Of The Bee Gees,"Containing the music for piano, vocal and guitar for 43 songs to the year 1989, this is a must for any musician. All the biggest hits are here, including some lesser known, but worthy songs. All the Gibb Brothers make comments on each song and there is a bibliography at the end. Like their music? You'll enjoy this collection."
2,Great while they lasted,"I owned these ear buds for about 6 months when I started having problems. Before that, I was very happy with them. I have small ears and these were the first ear buds I've ever used that fit and stayed in my ears. The sound quality was great for the money, and I also liked that the cord was extra long and having the volume control on the cord. The case it came with was pretty useless as it took forever to get them inside of it and when you did, it never closed right. All in all, I was very happy with them until the left side stopped working. I believe one of the wires must have gotten loose since it will work if I hold the cord a certain way, but I shouldn't have to do that. I don't believe that I abused them in anyway, I only used them while sitting at a desk, so I can only fault the design."
2,Good at first but doesnt last,"I loved these ear buds when i first purchased themBut within 3 months they developed a short in the wires which resulted in frequent sound outagesI returned them to the company, but unfortunately the replacement pair also developed a short within a relatively short period of time"
3,yes they are !,"Yes Skullcandy headphone or earbuds are deffinatly one of the top of the line ! I have purchased 3 pairs of buds in the last 3 years, ( keep loosing them ) I have allways been pleased with this product. This certain set doesn't have the sound quality my last 3 had, but for the price you can't beat it ! If you want some awsome buds , I would look into the higher priced buds, but you don't have to pay top $ just find a good pair on sale ? Shipped very fast too !UNFORGIVEN"
5,Headphones,I love my little earbuds they sound great easy to carry great price Love all the colors I could pick from
1,i wish they would stay in my ears,"i'm listening to music on these right now (red + purple!)...i have tried all three ""attachments"" and these things only stay in for a short period of time and i feel i have to jam them in my ear canal.sorta ok for sitting in a cube but i will not attempt to use these while moving...like, say, snowboarding. forget it.glad these only set me back a paper lincoln."
1,why skull cany why????,i have bin using these headphones for like over a year now and everyone has the same problem with them like after the 3rd month one of the speakers on the headphone start to act up if skull candy does not fix this issue soon then they might lose alot of sales due to the bad reports that people will eventually put up online about these products....im now thinking about buying the studio edition of the skull candy headphones but if i see 1 thing talking about 1 of the speakers going bad im not buying it and if i should count ive bin through 6 of the regular ones so far
1,I've bought two pairs and they both shorted on me...wouldn't suggest buying again...,"I bought two pairs and they both shorted on me (thought the first problem was a fluke and bought a second pair to replace--then it too shorted!)...wouldn't buy Skullcandy again. Note: I used them primarily while running, so perhaps the sweat affected them--aren't for me if I can't exercise with them."
4,Good buy,"These headphones do what they say they will do- block out sound around you. I feel pretty hip wearing them. The only problem I've found is that sometimes when I'm running/working out, the sound from the cord hitting my chest is rather annoying (kind of a bass-y, tapping sound). Other than that, good buy."
2,Returned the same day,"Despite previous reviews I found that these earbuds fit my ears wonderfully and I was quite excited to finally have a set of comfortable headphones. As soon as I plugged them into my computer to listen to music though the sound transmitted was choppy and very digital sounding. If all you're planning to use these for is with your mp3 player than it's not a bad deal, otherwise go ahead and spend a little more to get better sound quality."
2,"It won't stay in my hears, and keep on dropping","I thought that earbud skullcandy headphone will be in my hears very comfortabe, and they are going to stay there. That was the reason, and I bought it. My hears are normal size. It won't stay in my hears, and it keep on dropping!!!"
4,"For the price, can't beat it!","This is a GREAT product for the money you pay. I'm sure there are better ones out there, but these are perfect for me! I have small ears and have had a lot of trouble finding earbuds that actually stay in my ears...these work the best so far!"
4,Good deal,"I had a pair ofAudio Outfitters ULTRAEARS In-Ear Earphonesbut they seemed to walk away from my desk one day. I stumbled upon the Smokin Bud while looking for replacements and thought I'd give them a shot. The only thing I didn't like about the UltraEars was how dirty they got, these seemed like a great alternative. Unfortunately, I don't have the UltraEars to do a side by side comparison, by my memory says that the lead wire for these is thinner than that of the SX-70, we'll see how they hold up. Also, these don't seem as efficient as the SX-70, although that is not really a problem becasue I had to listen at the lowest volume setting at work anyway. Sound quality seems comparable, although they don't seem as full sounding, but I could be imagining that, it is not a drastic difference. On the plus side, they are cheaper, come with a decent case, and the inline volume control is a nice touch. All in all, you can't go wrong for the price."
4,"Quality buds, suspect sleeves","Like the reviewer who gave the white ones 4 stars, i got these buds with etymotic sleeves in addition to the ones pictured above. The etymotic sleeves bring the best out of these buds as the quality and depth of the sound really comes out and the sleeves dont slip out. The ones that come with the product are alright, I found that the sound is a little louder than with the etymotic sleevs but the bass isnt the same. The packaged sleeves' tip is too short to get a good fit so they're likely to slip out without much impetus. You can get the ones with etymotic sleeves on ebay for around $25..."
5,super comfy ear buds,"These are really really comfortable, it comes with differant sizes so they can fit anyone. I love that they have a volume control on them. And who wouldn't love the awesome colors?! I highly reccomend these"
4,Average headphones...,"I haven't shopped for headphones for quite some time so I wasn't sure what to look for. I'm not a purist by any means so my intention was to find a good set of earbuds to replace by upgraded zune earbuds (BTW, horrible!).I liked the basic treble sound but the bass couldn't have been better on my SBB3 model. Since you can only change the settings sound settings on a laptop or pc, I would recommend going with a different company if you want more bass. I like a wide range of music and hearing deep bass is hard to get from most earbuds."
2,A little disappointed,"I had heard really good things about these, but when I got them and tried them out the sound was horrible. There was almost no base. My stock ipod ear buds sounded better than these. I was tempted to return them but I decided to give them another chance, but I still haven't. Really bummed about it."
2,Very Limited Life,"I bought the ear buds to replace the ones that came with my iPod. I used it for about fifteen minutes and then the left earbud would not transmit any sound. Sending these ones back. I must say that the earbuds kept outside sound out very well (Much to my Mom's dismay, she couldn't fuss at me :-P ). Oh well."
5,ADORABLE.,THEY ARE BY FAR THE CUTEST HEADPHONES I HAVE PURCHASED.VERY COMFORTABLE AND MOD LOOKING . I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE TO ANYONE
4,Good value,"These sound good, and are pretty nice for the pricepoint. Only problem is there's no microphone for calls, which i was unaware of. If you're looking for a set to make phone calls with, this isn't it. I use them while working out, and they block the sweat very well. I destroyed my OEM headphones with sweat, so it's nice to see these hold up to the abuse."
2,Bleh...,Probably the worst headphones investment I've made. These things literally fall out of your ears when you are sitting at a computer. Don't expect to do any activity while listening to music. The sound quality is average to slightly below. The main problem is the headphones' problem with staying in your ear. Don't waste you money.
1,Sounds fine but break easily at connector,"I bought a pair of these trying to find a pair of headphones that would fit and stay in my ear while running. I paid $35+ at a local store. They seemed to work better than most for my ears. But within a couple of months the right ear started cutting in and out (I always put them in with the lettering showing outward). I thought this was possibly due to something I may have done by mishandling them or maybe I just got a flukey bad pair - after all they were expensive right?So I bought a second pair exactly like the first. Yep, you guessed it. They started cutting out in the same ear and before I could get back to my bag to swap them out for another pair they completely stopped working. Both pair have some kind of issue with the connector where they connect to my ipod - the issue being a cheap connector or cheap solder joint! So now, $70+ later, I have no headphones. Imagine giving away your $30."
2,not that great,pretty good headpdones for the price. HURTS the ear and hard to find the right size. i wouldnt reccomend these to anyone
3,NOT as good as the Sony MDREX51LP,"OK, I am no hardcore music freak, but I got these skullcandy smokin buds. I like the design and I really really like having a volume adjuster on the cord. That is why I bought these. Now they are good headphones. But I have the Sony MDREX51LP also and the Sony's have a much deeper bass to them. Also the Sony cord is sturdier and I think it will not get kinked as easily."
1,Trust the BAD Reviews!,"I should have listened to the bad reviews before I bought a pair. DO NOT BUY THESE. Like everyone else, one side stopped working. Had I continued to use them, I'm sure the other side would have stopped as well. Very disappointed, and will not be buying from this company again. Yes they are comfortable, but it's not worth it if they break in just a few months."
4,Good product,I purchased these for two reasons. They fit comfortably and you have a separate volume control. They have not disappointed me.
1,Meh...,"For a low-priced earphone, the sound quality on these isn't all that bad. I've had mine for almost 2 months and haven't had any dropouts. That said, I'm surprised I haven't chucked them after that long: the fit on these is terrible! They come with 3 sets of silicone plugs, and none of them seem to create an acceptable seal. I can occasionally get a good seal, and thus good sound quality, but most of the time they work their way out and sometimes even fall out completely.Another complaint is that the cable lengths on the 'Y' portion are asymmetric - the left ear is much shorter than the right, so you have the double-annoyance of increased weight on your left ear and a dangly loop of wire constantly brushing against the front of your neck."
2,Flat sound,"I will confess I haven't found a decently valued set of earbuds. My Shure earbuds sounded great (for $200) and broke after only a year. I picked up a pair of skullcandy since they looked nice and my daughter liked them. I found the sound quality flat for the music I was listening to, even in comparison to the cheaper ipod ear pieces. My first set broke and figuring the first pair was a snafu of some sort I bought a second pair, same sound issues. I liked the fact they came with a carry case and they were comfortable to wear. These won't be my next earbud purchase."
4,"good earbuds, don't last long","so i got these earbuds about 2 days after i ordered, thank u amazon.they were awesome, completely sound blocking, great sound (atleast better than my apple headphones) the only problem was that i like to listen to my music loud sometimes, and these headphones wont handle it.my left earbud stopped making sound while the right was too quiet.luckily there is a great warranty...just goes to show you,dont throw away the warranty information =//////(real nice price too)"
3,Not for anyone active,"whats good: the accoustics are good, you can hear the symbles an higher frequncy. the ear peices come off easy, super glue fixes that.What sucks: if you move, the ear pieces pick up vibration, destorting the sound to the point of not hearing it. not buds of comfort, if you want comfort look some where else"
1,Unsuitable for high powered air rifles,"As others have mentioned, this product will not hold up to high powered air rifles. After about 200 shots with my Benjamin NP XL 1100 using 15gr .22 Crosman hollow points I had shredded the back ""baffle"" plate (redirects into bottom of receptacle in rear) and was about to start punching through the rear housing. I'd hate to see what an 18-21 gr pellet would do to it."
3,"Good price, but you get what you pay for","I am not unsatisfied with my dehydrator, but after several years of use the tray are starting to warp/melt. It dries things fairly quickly, and having a large garden (3/4 acre) I use it all year long.The only thing I don't like is the uneveness of the drying. Not haveing a fan makes this a problem. The stuff on the inside of the tray dries quicker than the stuff along the rim, and things on the bottom tray can sometimes burn in 8 hours (while I am at work) since it gets much warmer near the bottom than the top. Most of the time I use an empty tray on the bottom to act as a spacer between the food and element, which helps.If you are looking to dry a few things for snacks or camping this is a good starter model. But if you are perserving a harvest that you rely on for your winter food I would suggest looking for a higher end model with a fan and thermostatic control. which is what I am looking for now."
4,Great dehydrator!,"We have had one of these for years, and purchased this as an addition so we can dry twice as much beef jerky at a time. We tried one of those other dehydrators with the circulation fan in it, and hated it - this one works much better!"
4,Adam,"Excelent product. The auto darkener works very well. The helmet was an extremely good fit. It looks really cool too. Though I must say it was not as advanced as I would have hoped for the kind of money I spent. Though, all in all, a really good product"
4,wired,this is in my car for 2+ years and is still going strong thery is no leak so far. fast ship worth the money.accel good all around products.
2,Watching a mess being cleaned up,"Maybe it's because I'm a ""root cause"" person who asks why something happened to begin with, but watching this program was like watching a janitor cleaning up a mess in the cafeteria and blaming the janitor for the mess. By 2007, the damage had already been done with subprime mortgages being created for the last 10 years. Blame whoever you want, but rest assured that it was this feeding frenzy of low no documentation, interest only ""creative"" loans that broke the mold along with the credit default swaps that created this mess. It was also the reason for the housing bubble, now that the people who became eligible for a mortgage increased. It would have been more interesting to know more about the relationship between Freddie Mac and Barney Franks during the past 10 years. This problem is not over yet and when I hear the government and media saying the people are ""entitled"" to fair and affordable mortgages, it concerns me."
2,I dunno bout this,It worked perfectly for a while but then I noticed the controller wasn't lasting as long as it used to. It didn't give the controller any exra charge after 3 weeks. I took off the battery pack and the little plug that sticks out was crooked. I tried to move it back and it just broke off.
5,Great screenplay,"""I Shot Andy Warhol"" was an amazing movie with a great screenplay that swept the characters of the film through the surrealism and strangeness of the sixties, and this is the screenplay. It's great how the mental degeneration of the main character is depicted so subtly."
4,Great baby book!,"I love this baby book. I wanted something that was pretty, not too cutesie and really captured what I considered to be the big milestones. It's great because it has a lot of space for details about the birth and coming home, as well as places for birthday pics through about age 5. We're expecting another baby girl and will be purchasing the same book, just with a different cover.My only complaint is that some of the info is a little irrelevant - ie the section about childhood illnesses has a place to record things that are not common nowadays bc of vaccines. I'd rather see a place to record the first big stomach bug, or common childhood illnesses like hand, foot, mouth, roseola, etc. Otherwise it's perfect."
3,Could be better....,"I purchased this book as soon as it came out and couldn't wait to receive it because of all the insight and information that it's description promised. There are some interesting points made, but quite a bit of the book is cutesy and saccharine, as though it has been written by a 12 year old for a 12 year old All the smiley faces sprinkled throughout the text are distracting and annoying, and make the reader begin to feel as though they are reading a note being passed in study hall. As mentioned before, some of the information is interesting, however, some of the topics are picked to death to the point where the conclusions drawn are simply ridiculous. This book has it's ""okay"" points. If it's possible to pick it up used, do so. That way, you can still read the book, but not pay so much for the small amount of useful information you will get from reading it."
3,"A tasty tidbit, but don't take it too seriously","I enjoyed the synopsis of the stories and having all of the connections in one place. The writing style, while occasionally silly, is appropriate for a wide range of ages, and it was a fun read while waiting for The Order of the Phoenix.However, I feel the authors went way overboard on some of their predictions. They are fine when qualified with ""we think"" or ""is it possible?"" but to state certain beliefs as fact, especially when those beliefs are very tenuously rooted in the ""hints"" provided, is too much."
4,An interesting and in depth analysis,"I found this book very interesting and liked it very much. The background info on names, in specific, was wonderful. It opens up a whole new world of ideas for me as to what will happen in the next few books and gives interesting insights as to particular characters' actions. The book is actually rather accurate most of the time (I read it after I read OotP). Some fascinating septology clues are pointed out that I never would have found on my own, like references to other works that JKR might parallel.There were some things I didn't like. For example, parts of the Restricted Section in the back. I found it a bit far-fetched, though, certainly, what they say is possible. Then there's some things I thought that the solution/answer was obvious to, yet they couldn't figure it out. Overall, though, it was a fun book to read and was very insightful."
1,Vague and repetitive,Summary skips over significant clues in favor of those that support writer's hypotheses. Strangely homophobic in comments made about Flitwick and Lockhart. Almost useless.
3,An Interesting Book,"I like this book a lot, it is quite interesting and there were a LOT of things I didn't realize about the Harry Potter books. It really makes me appreciate JKR more and since reading this I have never payed attention to the people who claim the books are too long because of 'useless' (this book proves they're actually hints!) details.The problem with this book is that it's a bit too in-depth. They look at EVERYTHING, even considering repeated words or phrases clues, like the number 12. This can get boring and often I would put the book down in disgust because they thought the littlest things were big clues. But then I'd pick it up again and find out something like,""Wow, every 13th chapter you are introduced to the villain!"" and be interested again. This is a book best flipped through occaisonally."
3,What do you expect?,"Yes, these are cheapo router bits. They will go dull in a heartbeat. But there are a bunch of them, and I get to have the ""right"" bit for very little money. So I use them regularly, and save up for some whiteside bits."
4,Great starter kit,"I wanted a good selection of bits without spending 12-40 bucks a pop and find out I didn't need it. Now I can try different bits out and figure out which ones I need to spend the money on. These are all edging, groove, and straight bits. No face bits are included. I made a few picture frames so far and was pleased with the results. So far the bits I used are still sharp so they didn't go dull on the first pass."
4,Good product,"Great selection for the price. I've used these bits to route both pine and red oak with no problems. I am by no means a professional, but have used some of the bits over a dozen times. They still cut as well as they did their first time. I would have liked a better selection/assortment, but for the price, this set can't be beat."
2,Doesn't clean well,"Unfortunately the long bristles on this brush do not clean well. It is very difficult to get food off of dishes. I have owned several brands of ""soap dispensing dish brushes"" and this one by far is the worst. After using this for a few weeks, I am very disappointed in the product."
3,"It's Okay, but ...","This brush is a little hard to use ... I mean, it's okay ... but when you push the button that is suppose to dispense dish soap very little soap if at all squirts out or too much. But, after a little use, it functions okay but certainly no cigar!"
1,Broke in 3 Months!,"This brush is supposed to be refillable, unfortunately the soap squirt button broke within 3 months. I now have refills and no handle! I had another one of these that lasted much longer, but the design is much different on this one and the rubber cracks where the material is bonded to the hard plastic. It's not good."
2,"Works well, but not forever.","Works the way it is supposed to but as previously noted, the push button will develop a hole or crack, especially if you have longer nails. I've gone through about 3 of these brushes. In general, the brush body will last long enough for you to go through 2, maybe 3 brush heads.Still, it is a good idea, lets you use just enough soup without wasting. Just wish the rubber button was made out of something more durable, like silicone.Update 2/18/12 - They are on their third design change and have still not gotten it right. The button on the most recent change (this one you load the soap from a screw off handle) develops a split/crack even faster than previous designs, making the soap leak all over. Did not even get through one brush head.I've taken off a star for this. A good idea but very sloppy design. You'd think they would get it right after three tries. It's almost like they WANT it to fail so you have to buy a new one."
3,"Nice brush - leaks a bit, though.","I love Oxo stuff, but, this is the third one of these that I've gone through because they tend to leak soap if you actually use the built-in soap-dispensing feature."
1,"Don't waste your money, I've had two of these things fall apart on me.","In general, I like Oxo products, they have some very clever ideas, and they are usually well built. But this pile of crap does not last more than a few weeks. The first one I bought, lasted maybe a month before the large flat end where the brushes attach came unglued. Yes, it's only glued on, and the adhesive just gave up, so soap leaked out all over the place. I had purchased a bunch of the brushes and scrub pads that go on the thing, so I thought I would give them a second chance. The second one I bought lasted about three weeks before the hinge that the internal mechanism is mounted on just broke off. These two items were not abused, used heavily, or in the case of the second one, hardly even touched. Based on my experience with this thing, I will think twice, and look very closely, at any future Oxo products I think about buying."
3,Much ado about nothing,"I noticed another reviewer mention the triteness of this album; I tend to agree but not to such a degree. The music itself is great, of course, but this album is very much a muted effort. The first track, Mama Guela, is an all time-favourite song of mine and I think the Spanish Harlem Orquesta does it some justice, but overall I would call this album just a little bit flat. A decent addition to a DJ's collection but maybe not for the afficionado."
5,Amazing album,This is an amazing CD - the arrangements and compositions are just outstanding. The classics and new songs performed by these legendary artists are simply beautiful. *Every* song is great. Don't miss it!
4,Great biscotti!,"Having just purchased the Family Circle cookbook, I thought I'd make something for the holidays to share with family and friends. I decided to try both of the biscotti recipes in the book, and they were surprisingly quite simple, and turned out wonderfully. I have yet to try other recipes in the book, but if they turn out anything like my first trys I'll have to change my rating to 5 stars!"
3,prefer sombra warm therapy,"Container for the cool therapy is handy, but the warm sombra therapy works better for my arthritic knee."
5,It Works!,"This stuff works better than anything else I have tried. I have a spot on my back that gives me trouble, and Sombra worked like a charm the last flare-up I had."
5,Classic Harryhausen,Great storyline and acting. The highlight though is the special effects done by Harryhausen. Very good picture quality. I loved this movie as a kid and still love it now.
5,PEACE OF MIND,"I own a Computer store and I have security cameras where I can look in at the store from home. I have installed the Street Wise motion detector and connected it to my telephone line. If ever an intruder was to break into the store, the motion detector would call up to four numbers including my cellphone. All I would have to do is look at my monitor and I would see exactly whats happening. This device therefore gives me complete peace of mind and security 24 7.Its like having a security guard at your place permanently. I have this item for over two years and it continues to work. I sell these at my store, and do have satisfied customers."
1,bait and switch,"This item pictured is an ostrich skin (or simulated ostrich skin) magnetic money clip. What I received in the mail was a black bill fold sized fold over with a brass bar in the middle. It in no way resembled the item pictured. However, they did the return and refund process promptly."
5,Extraordinary Music by Celebrated and Innovative Composer,"Every music lover and library should own a copy of this CD. Composer-conductor Evgeni Kostitsyn is the Marco Polo of music; in his compositions and productions, daring to go where no one has gone before-- and he does so with superb results. Kostitsyn, the author of a new method for the organization of music called Synchronous Music, brings the form to life in his American Requiem I."
1,Dime Novel Trash!,"This was a trashy dime novel that could have told its relatively interesting ""mystery"" story in far fewer pages. The ""romance"" portion was so over the top that it became boring in the extreme.I read the Kindle edition and it was incredibly poorly edited. Misspellings, bad punctuation, and poor formatting were rampant."
1,Painful!!!,Anyone praising this product has obviously never accidentially gotten any EMT Gel on a paper cut of their own. Good grief I tried to put some of this on a small cut on my dogs paws years ago and holy cow! It got in an open wound I had and it was the most horrible pain ever. I liken the experience to pouring rubbing alcohol on a fresh road rash! It burns and I will NEVER use this on my dogs or any animal. I'm glad I accidentially got some in my cut. I wouldn't want to put my dog through that.
3,A whole lot of sex and not enough depth,"A great book if you want a novel filled with sex and heat, but I found the characters lacking in emotional depth and richness. The book spent a lot of time running around the desert and in bed, but not enough time developing the people in the story. I got no sence of who Jamal was, what makes him tick.It will not live on my bookshelf, but it was worth the price of the purchase."
4,Wonderful reminder of a time gone by,"I was a student at Clinton High School during some of those turbulent years, but was not aware that Mrs. Anderson had written this book until just recently. Of course, it's out of print, so I was thrilled to find it available on Amazon! It's a wonderful account of the events of that time period and those who were most affected by those events. I'm so happy to have it, and I'll pass it along to my children. By the way, I'm BigAl's wife. :-)"
1,Don't waste your money...,"I had nothing but problems with this printer. I called up HP and got some guy from India that I couldn't even understand. Needless to say, after hours and hours of frustration, the problem was never fixed. I had spent so much money replacing the printing heads and ink because every time that you run maintenance on it, it eats up half of your ink reservoir. Finally, I cut my losses and threw it in the dumpster. The best decision I made."
1,Brain Numbing,I couldn't get past page 2 and I am an English teacher very interested in the modern novel.
2,Not really useful,Just returned from a 10 day trip wandering around a variety of cities in Germany mostly in the southern part. I had taken the Marling Menu Master along with me because of how valuable it had been on a previous trip in the mid 1980's. Well on this trip it was basically useless. Here's why: #1 - the menu-master was originally written in 1971 and has not been updated since. Of course German cuisine has moved on since 1971. #2 - the menu master was basically useless for the regional cuisine I encountered in the southern region of Germany. Finally English is much more prevalent than what I had experienced on my last trip - of long ago. So I would have to say you'd be better off with a decent German dictionary than the menu master.
1,"Worst Product, Avoid This at All Costs","Purchased to paint some plastic covered shelves and one month later the shelves are still tacky, flaking where they managed to dry, and overall ruined what was supposed to be a great project for Christmas.Avoid this product at all costs, find something else that actually works."
2,Critical of Krylon,"Krylon paint ""especially for plastic"" is greatly over-rated and over-priced. It does not cover, does not adhere any better than any $1.00 can of spray paint. Big disappointment. Almost $40.00 down the drain."
5,This is real Turkish folk music...,"If you wanna listen some tunes from middle anatolia, you should get Bayram Bilge Tokel or Neet Erta from somewhere. I listen so many different music styles ranging from black metal to anatolian folk and i can honestly say this is one of the best recordings i have had... Get it before it lasts.."
4,"I don't read novels, especially romance","So I will preface this review with the fact that I almost never read novels, and really never read romance. However, a friend handed me this book and I decided to give it a chance. I do love literature, and to me this never fealt like another cheap paperback romance, of which an author might write 5 a year. I felt this book to be a true piece of literature, and completely worthy as such. So for those of your out there like me, you might want to give this a try.She creates complete atmospheres with word, and beautiful, sensual descriptions of her world both inside her mind, and outside of it. And my love for the European lifestyle only get me more excited about reading this. High Recomend, check it out."
3,So desperately close to greatness,"Lyrical, poignant and utterly honed perfection until somewhere in the middle where it sunk with the weight of artifice. I, more than most, did not want the genderless narrator to matter, because, yes, it shouldn't. But, unfortunately I found it an unnecessary, indulgent, clunky conceit. And Winterson came close to pulling it off, but ultimately the novel, that was destined to be winged, sunk swathed, adled in all its post-modern clothes. The anatomical descriptions are beautiful, achingly so, but redundant, unlikely. Ah, so desperately close to greatness, and it would have been had it not been for its ""experiential"" nature. Kudos for stylistic bravery though. But, damnation, with my hopes so soaring, the landing was a bruise."
5,Hooked on Marmalade Boy!,"I love shojo manga/anime--and so far, Marmalade Boy has to be one of my favorites. The story sets in high school, where a japanese girl by the name of Miki Koishikawa, has her life turned upside down when her parents decided to switch partners with a couple they met while vacationing in Hawaii. To top it all off, that couple has a son her age who is awfully cute. It's a cute teenage romantic soap opera. I like the anime better but the manga is good as well. This is a great buy if you're into romantic reads. The characters are cute as well."
1,Haynes Automotive Repair Manual Dodge Caravan 2003-2006,"I own at least 10 Haynes Repair manuals I have collected over the years yes, thats alot of junkers I have kept running. I have grown to trust the quality of information in these manuals. However, this manual disturbs me greatly, why? Trees had to die so this book could be printed. It is missing half of the schematics. It does not tell you anything about troubleshooting or testing or give you any test data to compare anything to. It does tell you how to take some things off/on. It does have an informative maintenence schedule at the beginning. They gave this book very little effort to compile and I am greatly dissappointed. I didn't need to buy the book to get the maintenence schedule. There is very very little information that is useful. I think this IS the worst attempt at writing a car repair maual I have ever seen. For the love of God and country...save your money..."
1,This is an answer book only! This is not the textbook!,This book is advertised as something it is not. Do not order this book if you want the textbook! This book offers answers to the questions in the text ONLY!
3,Logical Argumentative,"I read this book during my Class Apologetics. Especially I have quoted in my search work on title of Science and Miracle. NG is a finest scholar of our day. The vivid point I still have in mind is ""Science in within nature that have been perform by hunman brain, but miracle are supernatural which are above the nature. Miracle within reveals the existence of God. From Raj Kumar"
5,Lovely and fun little birdhouse!,"I purchased this for my 8 month old daughter... she played and played and played with it until she was about 18 months. Still in great shape (impressive, considering this was the go-to toy for 10 months or so) and am planning to pass it onto my niece. Beautiful colors, well made- a great purchase."
5,Great little toy,"My 9 month old baby loves this little toy, she will sit for quite some time undoing the little velcro closures on the roof and door and putting the birdies in the house and taking them out. All the birds look different and have different material on them which seems to be a tactile adventure for her since she is constantly stroking them and stuffing them in her mouth. My 3yr old also likes to jump in and play with this, acting out little play scenes with the birds. Very versitile toy! Durable too, our puppy has grabbed each piece a few times but his needle teeth haven't inflicted any lasting damage on it."
5,"Fun, stimulating toy","I bought this birdhouse for my seven-month-old daughter and she loves this toy! Since she's teething, she mostly loves to chew on the birds, as they are soft and colorful. Each of the four birds have different shapes, colors and textures and make a soft rattle sound. They are the perfect size for her to grasp in one hand. Some of them have little rope-like legs with a knot on the end, which she loves to put in her mouth. The birdhouse is stimulating and very colorful to look at, as well. She can glimpse in the clear part and see the birds inside. I like the fact that as she grows, she'll be able to put the birds in the hole in the roof or through the movable front door. It's nice it has a little carrying handle, which is textured - and she loves to chew on that, too. I'm very pleased with the purchase and hopefully this will be a toy she will play with for a long time!"
3,"Escape is Good, But the CD Could Use Work!!","Dj Escape does a fantastic job mixing in and out of every song on the track list. But if I would have known that every song on the Disc was going to be music that is played and heard everywhere, I would have held off and not even bothered! But, on the lighter side, Escape brings another overlooked and underrated groove, ""Punk::Ferry Corsten""!!!!!! Beautiful song, and I flipped when I heard it!! I set the CD Player on Repeat for at least two days! Wonderful uplifting Tech-Trance!!!! The rest of the CD is just plain 'ol Dance. :("
2,PICTURE AND DATA ARE NOT THE SAME,"The guage shows -15-0-+15 the text says -60-0+60 what am I getting? The text also does not show the rear, is it a single wire light or are there 2 wires so the meter can be grounded? If I knew I would have ordered 100 for a kit I was building"
4,A Greater Yes,This movie was good as it displayed truths we all must face in one way or another. I would definitely recommend it.
1,would not know,"had to send (2) smokers back due to damage during shipping. was not shippers fault. very bad packaging,would be suprized if anyone could get one in good shape."
4,A Breath of Fresh Air,"I bought this CD after hearing an exerpt while browsing through CDBaby. Her voice is pure and clear and the lyrics of the songs express feelings of real people living real lives that involve spouses, kids and responsibilities. This lady should be toward the top of the country charts. With some more creative backing, she is on her way."
4,My Review,"So far, I am very pleased.. My only complaint is that the sound quality of the first few tracks on the first cd are not very good."
5,My 3 yr old LOVED the movie so this book is perfect !!,"This book was what we wanted - the original book is not enough like the movie for us.My little girl LOVES the Brave Girl (as we call her), the Lonely boy, the ghost, and all the stuff that happenns on the train ride (skiing, Karaboo, the roller coaster effects etc). The original Book has NONE of those elements. So for us this book was PERFECT!The previous reviewer said the inconsistancies really bugged her. We felt the differences in the art were no big deal - most occur at a distance so they had little impact. As for it being ""dark"" the movie occurs at night. . . it's almost always dark!There are a bunch of pixs I wish they had included but this book had all the major elements that we were hoping would be there - we are quite pleased. I hope the movie releases a book with tons more pixs but if they never do this book does a nice job ."
5,"Outstanding pace, technically accessible, excellent read!","This story was truly inventive and thought provoking. At the intersection of science and religion, I found this genetic thriller wonderfully paced. It questioned the very essence of religious belief, and the potentially apocalyptic and extraordinary possibilites of scientific achievement. I could not put it down!!!! Bravo for a debut author."
4,A book that's hard to put down,I brought this book as something to read on my way back to the UK after a business trip to the States. Unfortunatly I made the mistake of starting the book one evening and now I have to buy another book for the return trip having finished it in three nights.The book has the qualities of Michael Crichton and Arthur C. Clark rolled into one. The result is a compelling read that questions many of your own beliefs and you find yourself debating it's content even after you've stopped reading.Looking forward to the next book from this new and talented author.
5,"So far, so good",It arrived quickly and was easy to set up with the help of a toll free call to DISH. It works my DVD player as well. I'm happy with my new remote control!
3,confirms again my high regard to this hero of rock and roll,"Well, the best place to start appreciating Mickey is to getJuppanese and seek out the hard to find Legend Albums.This is a hodge podge, but thanks very much Paul Moules and all the people involved for putting out these rarities.This man can sing and play and write as good as ANY old school rocker you've ever heard. And that includes some of the giants like Elvis and Chuck Berry.I dont think I have the patience yet to sit through the slower or the unplugged stuff on this disk when I know how to find 2 particular tracks and get my fix of rock and roll bliss:First time I heard this toe tapping version of Switchboard Susan and So Long by ""Mickey Jupp & the Cable Layers"" I was nuts with happiness. darn ya Mickey , I CANT STOP rockin out to these! Somebody pull the plug on my CD player or I'll never stop!"
1,Very poor,"Just a quick review to reinforce what's been said by many others. Compared to the old Waterpiks I've had for years (and for which I can no longer get parts -- hoses are the weak spot -- otherwise I'd gladly repair them; I could go on at length about our throw-it-away society, but I'll spare you), this is a vastly inferior product. As others have noted, the water pressure is very weak, and the reservoir doesn't hold enough water to clean your teeth properly. Save your money."
3,Interplak,Does not have the jet tips that were in the advertised photo.Only has 4 of the regular tips enclosed with unit.
1,Stay far away...,"Updating my prior review. The product generally works OK for a month or two and then it dies. I'm now on my 2nd unit and it has gone bad. Warrant service is great, but the product lasts only for a month or two of active use."
2,Conair made negative changes,"Had a Conair WJ7b water jet, excellent for years, changes in this new product bearing the same number degraded performance - it doesn't pump as smoothly, removed a cord storage compartment which makes it less convienent. Unfortunately I bought two of them!"
4,"Somewhat noisy, but works very well.","I purchased this to replace a 10 year old unit that failed. It works well, but seems to operate at a higher noise level than our first one.For the price, it does great and I get good reports from the dental hygenist."
1,Good machine but no critical replacement Hose,"I bought one of these as a back-up a couple of years agowent to use it today and you guessed it .. the hose hadapparently dried out and broke into pieces in my hand.When I called customer service to order a new one, theysaid Conair doesn't carry spare hoses and that there isno way that you can buy one, other than to buy anothernew unit.... the rest of the machine is fine..... Thisis a lousey way to run a business .... Don't waste youmoney on this product with planned obselescence quietobviously built in ."
1,Good until the warranty expires,"We have one of these, it worked fine for awhile, but now its hit or miss if it will actually pump water. Our water is filtered/softened - so I doubt that there is anything from our water that caused it fail."
4,Patience for the pressure,"I had a water pik and it died early on. I bought the Interplak WJ7 - old old model - and loved it for probably three years when the hose split. Repair was unsuccessful so I bought the later B version - the only one available. Disappointed in the pressure - yes, but I noticed the slow down when adding the fluid, adjusting the pressure knob and realized the lack of pressure is due to excessive drag on the piston.Solution - fill with water and put the handle back in the container to circulate the water and run for 5 minutes. After a few cycles the piston wears in and it works just like the old model. Lots of pressure. It might even blow out the hose like my old one after a couple of years.Oops - after about a month I still put the handle back in the container and let it run a few minutes till the pressure builds - then it's OK. Not great but OK."
1,Don't waste your money,"Really liked my old Interplak, but it finally died. Ordered a new Interplak that was the closest to my old Interplak. Big mistake. New water jet doesn't even have a fraction of the pressure of the old water jet and I have to prime it every time I want to use it. Just printed out the return label and it's going back to Amazon tomorrow."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This is a worthless product. It makes a lot of noise, but it doesn't do anything. Most of the time I cannot get the water to come out and the heads are easy to come off. Save your money!"
2,Not what I expected,"I love the first CD. I was really excited when I saw a new CD in the store. There was no listening booth like with the first CD so I bought it without hearing anything. Sorry to say it was not what I was hoping for. I'm not sure why but the songs all feel the same. Something about the tempos maybe. Some, ok most, of the lyrics are really silly too. The music is not as layered or exciting as the first CD. There are brief moments of ""this might be cool"" but it losses it either by awkward vocals or the music not moving on to something bigger. I would call this CD a well produced Demo. A test of ""new"" style. But do people really want to hear disco re-done? Or Trip-Hop held back? Not those that know what this band was capable of giving us. Maybe the next CD will show us better where this band is going. Until then I'm only a fan of disc #1.Just because I have to...personally everytime I hear ""freezer"" I crack up. It's ssooo funny when Gerri rap/sings ""turned to stone""...just silly."
4,Does the job,"I bought this after a similar one of a different brand I had disappeared. It works fine, but the grip is somewhat confusing. It feels like the thicker part should be on the opposite side."
5,Heaven,"I looked high and low for this brand and this scent, and couldn't find it anywhere. It made the nicest gift for my husband, and I thank you for having it for me."
5,Great book for every Harry Potter fan,New Clues to Harry Potter Book 5 is simply a must read for every Harry Potter fan.
5,Durable and Easy To Use!,"I received this as a gift almost 12 years ago, and it still works and has a permanent place on my kitchen counter. The bowls and accessories have yet to crack, break, or melt in the dishwasher, and I've never had to sharpen the blades or the shredder edges. It blends, purees, chops, shreds, and grates things with amazing speed, and everything comes out even -- no big chunks and tiny bits. My husband complains because he always locks the bowl on backwards, but it's just a matter of looking, in my opinion. The only problems I have is that it's hard to get stuff out of the inside of the pusher (because it's so deep) and that it's now too small for our family! But I wouldn't give it up... it's been too reliable and has worked fabulously over the years."
4,Always a spare,"Although I already have 2 random orbit sanders (1 DeWalt + 1 Porter Cable), I don't like to keep changing paper-grit sizes. I have no preference to either brand as both are dependable and perform well."
4,Simple and Solid,"Received this ROS a couple of weeks ago and I have been using it to sand down teak deck chairs that needed to be refinished. I am pleased with it so far. It is a little heavy for sanding that requires a lot of repositioning and odd-angle sanding but it performs solidly. The absence of variable speeds is a bit of a drawback but if the interest is to find a simple, solid performer at a good price, the PC343K fits the bill."
5,"Good value, does the job, great features.","Having used this sander for many hours in the last year, I can say it works well. Powerful, ergonomically well designed and sturdily built. I especially lke the dust port which easily hooks up to shop vac. This makes the sander virtually dust free, a very important feature for me."
1,avoid at all cost,"This sander is junk, and I only hope you have looked past the other high reviews and have read what other full time woodworkers have written. PC needs to spend less time trying to make ""cool"" looking tools and get back to making quality electric hand tools. I typically sand 450+ doors/drawers a year not to mention cabinets. I have been through several PC sanders. When my last 333 broke, I bought this newer version of what I though was a similar machine. Night and day. This sander wanders uncontrollably, leaves swirl marks everywhere, and eats through sandpaper. After 3 hours of sanding it went back in the box to be returned. Bring back the light grey workhorses you were once know for and scrap these dark grey POS's. PC will see no more of my hard earned dollars."
1,vexing to read,"Very poorly proof-read. It seemed to exchange ""appointment"" with ""dancing"".More than one word is incorrectly broken with a space. This was in Kindle format. It was simply not enjoyable to read. I didn't bother to finish it."
2,The Backup Plan,Summer reading that does not require much from the reader. I found the plot unbelievable ~ would a guy wait for you for 10 years? They had not even kept in touch as friends! The romance was too predictable. And treatment for PTSD is a far cry from what was described in this story. I skimmed through a good part of this book just to say I finished it. It simply did not hold my interest.
2,What a drive!,"I haven't finished the book, tho I am enjoying it & will surely finish it. I am listening to an audiobook, my favorite type of reading.Dinah decides on a whim in the middle of the morning to drive to Atlanta (from Charleston). She tries to find Bobby but, alas he has returned to Charleston for the night. Dinah then drives back to Charleston. She arrives the same day AND she gets home in time to watch 3 hrs of TV before her mother plots for her to go out with Cord that night. Now that is some day! No model of car was mentioned, but I'm thinking Formula One.I hate it when authors don't know the territory of which they write...and then editors don't catch geography errors. This isn't some typo, Charleston and Atlanta are over 300 miles apart by car. 600 miles in no time. What a drive!"
5,Easy to Understand,"This is the best book to start heading into calculus. Every subject in precalculus had been made very easy to understand with precise examples and answers to all examples in the appendix WITH detailed explanations. There was not one subject in this book that I could not understand. I used it primarily as a review since it has been 3 years since I touched calculus, but the material was presented very down to earth."
1,filters are too small!,"These filters are marked 20"" x 30"", but in reality they are 19 5/8"" x 29 1/2"". The flange around the edges of my filter enclosure is too narrow, these just fall through. I cannot understand how someone can get away with labeling something incorrectly like this. I wonder if all of there sizes are mislabeled?"
1,would not work with verizon card,I tried to get two of these to work with the Verizon pc5750 card without success even after updating the software. I ended up buying the Linksyswireless-g router for mobile broadband (wrt54g3g-vn)which works well and was priced less. The Linksys did require a software update from the Linksys website.
5,A great cookbook for food from Lancaster,"As a native of Lancaster all of my life, a shopper of Central Market, and a person who loves to cook, I highly recommend this cookbook. It has some great facts about the start of Central Market and TONS of wonderful recipes for local food. Scrapple, REAL pot pie, dips, caseroles, pasta dishes, cakes, and pies are all in this book. My copy is very dog eared, because there are so many great things to make! Buy this book if you like to cook great food!"
1,Boring stories,"I'm English trying to improve my French and although I like the layout of the pages, making it easy to check your translation for the words, the stories are very boring. I struggled to read them in English and so was unable to read more than a page or so at a time. I would like to see a similar book with stories that are more appealing."
3,dont know if it works,"Ive been using this product for a month now, but not sure if it works b/C we are still dealing with fleas, so I need to still use Frontlineplus. BUT my cats absolutely love it. They hear me take the bottle out and they come running."
4,Natural Flea Control,"I have never been a fan of topical flea control. The fact that I have to wear gloves to apply it make me wonder why it is ok for my dog's skin. I was so happy to find flea away. So far, so good; we have been using it for over 2 months and I have only detected one flea that jumped off my girl and onto the couch. We rarely come across ticks in our area, but we have mosquitos. To my knowledge, the topical applications do not claim to deter mosquitos, but Flea Away does. I would recommend this product."
2,Good for vitamins...not so good with fleas,"Yes my dog gobbled them up, yes the vitamins are good for him but I got the product to help keep fleas off of him and it didn't work."
1,Thank God for Blockbuster.,This game is totally not as good as it sounds I went to Blockbuster and considering the movie was one of my favorites I thought this game would be good well I got home and put it in to my XBOX and I discovered that I was the wrongest person on earth at that moment thank god I rented it but still I wasted 4.50 on a video game that should be removed from the shelf at every store that owns it I was in EB Games that day and asked the guy if they had Catwoman and he said yes but it was for PS2 the game console that I really want right now so I was really dissapointed that they didn't have it thank god they didnt cause I would of bought and returned so thank god for Blockbuster this game is just terrible and I would be shocked if no store knew that. My grade over all (F-)
2,no end in sight,Hmmmmm..... i rad tis to kill time while starting projectors. i've read Neil Gaiman before (American Gods) and wasn't able to finish that book. the reason : great story but no end in sight. the same thing with 1602.i love the idea and the concept of the characters in the 17th century. the story line is ok but fizzels out near the middle and you have to keep reminding there are only a few pages left.i had a hard time wanting to finish this book. besides the bad art work (some it is really cool) some of the faces of the characters look like they have been drawn by amateurs.the backbone to neil gaiman his ability to have and idea for a story. he can tell a story but the middle and end is where he needs help. the middle is drawn out and the end comes 50 or 60 pages to late.rent or borrow don't buy
3,Good for Marvel Fans,I had tried reading this in the book store one time and did not have good feel for it. I recently went to Wizard World Philly and saw it and decided to try it again. I thought maybe I would have enjoyed more at home and I was right.Now I am not a big comic book reader. Unless it is written by Joss Whedon and I then I read things here and there. I knew of some of the background story's of the X-men and Fantastic Four but I don't follow them religiously. I am also not a Neil Gaiman fan. My husband loves him but I have a hard understanding what some brit authors are talking about in their books. That aside I still thought it was an interesting story line to the Marvel Universe. Putting in the past made it seem more real.
4,Great Imagination,"Recasting the Marvel characters in a re-imagined Elizabethan court is a stroke of comic genius. Nick Fury as Elizabeth's head of intelligence; Dr Strange as the queen's magician and counsel; Thor in a surprise role -- and more! Best of all, though, is that the plot keeps moving. My only question is when can we get the next installment?"
4,They work,"caps for cans.. they work as advertisedWish i didn't have to buy on there own though, one of the down falls of purchasing online"
2,too big,The photo above shows the lids fitting on most canned items. The lids are too big to fit on any of my pet food or regular canned goods. :(
3,Flimsy,"These pet food cat can covers are on the flimsy side. They come out of the dishwasher malformed.Also, other pet food can covers I have, can fit 3-4 different sizes of cans. These ones can only fit 1 size."
2,work but with some effort,the plastic material is too stiff. i have to put a little more work to get them fit on the cans.
1,Food can covers,These covers are THE WORST! They are a struggle to use. Who would think a product so simple could be so unsatisfactory?
2,They work but....,These caps work but they feel pretty cheap and the plastic is so thin that they are very rigid. We also ordered one that was a bit more expensive but it has a softer rubbery feel to it and it's obvious that you get what you pay for.
4,Good product..but..,Great product..just took me FOREVER to get the sticky lables off the inside of the lids! Will recommend them though!
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I'm probably the biggest Rammstein fan there is, so this video was a must have for me.Watching them perform is a religious experience, at least for me!!!There just aren't words to describe them, so you'll have to see them for yourself!!!!!!"
5,Spiel Mit Rammstein,The uncensored VHS tape of Live Aus Berlin. Much better than the censored version of the DVD and we all know why. This VHS tape must be bought. Pop it in the VCR and go back in time!
5,Awesome performance by Germany's best industrial-metal band,"On Rammstein's first(?) DVD, they are playing in (guess where)Berlin in a super-high energy performance playing tracks from their first two CD's. I've watched this DVD multiple times, and I have to say that this is an exceptional concert. The band has great energy, Flake does a dance, and Till does somersaults in boots that shoot sparks. On the ending track, Seemann, Flake gets an inflatable boat and crowd-surfs on it. They didn't play a few songs I wanted them to play (Der Meister, Eifersucht), but overall it's an amazing show."
1,"Horrible Product, Horrible Customer Service","I have had many roll's of paper and never encountered anything like this. I purchased this paper, placed it on my background stand, barely pull to get some down, and the whole entire roll emptied out on the floor in less than a second. Nothing keeps this paper on the roll, and customer service was extremely rude when I called to complain about how the product handled. Never will buy from Calumet ever again!"
2,Never really gets going.,"Kind of depressing. Makes you want to smack someone! By the time it ends, you still have not really got a plot going,or s feel for it. Just goes nowhere."
5,crackers,"Very yummy! The product was well within date for freshness, tasty to eat...everyone in our family liked them!"
5,Excellent,Extremely well written and incredibly timely. Michelman does an excellent job laying out the facts and educating the reader. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is itnerested in the topic of abortion rights.
4,Pistol Case,"Item is as described, quality OK for price & fits my needs. But after reading another review about small case, I figured medium case would be enough for my compact 9mm. But gun just barely fits in, so reconsider with large case if in doubt."
2,pattern incorrect,The pattern key for the secret treasures bag on page 47 is wrong. It wasn't until I was almost finished that I realized that they have reversed the mc with the ccA on the key. The key has you making a mostly yellow bag instead of the orange bag that is shown in the book. This was frustrating because I really liked the way the colors muted after the felting. With yellow as the background color it is not as nice. I wish I could call someone and complain!!
3,Not crazy about it,Not many patterns that I find useful. I'll probably gift it. Maybe someone else will like it better.Had a few good tips.
1,bad bad bad,The plot had promise but after trying to read this book not once but twice I finally gave up. It was boring and was effective in putting me to sleep.
2,Wish I'd read the reviews on this one BEFORE buying it.,"As a former road warrior myself, who loves hotels, airports and the perks of airline rewards programs I love the general concept of this book - a man in pursuit of hitting the one million mile rewards mark. But, beyond that, this book just doesn't deliver.There's no real story behind it, just a man meandering around trying to overcome the guilt of his job helping fire people and trying to figure out how to do something else. It's written in a scattered way that's hard to follow, and even harder to care about the unsympathetic characters.I have to agree with all the other reviewers that say the movie was far better. In fact, other than the general concept the book and movie have very little in common. Normally, one would expect this to be a good thing. There's so many more opportunities with a novel to build a richer, more complex tale. But, it just doesn't happen in this case.BOTTOM LINE: Skip the book and rent the DVD instead."
1,"Non-sense, would give it zero stars !! Don't read it !!","Unfortunately I got this garbage book because of the movie version of it, but hated it. The book is totally, utterly nonsense and it got me thinking ""why did I do to deserve such piece of trash in my hands?"". I'd give it up were not for my obsession with books, even bad books I usually read till the end, otherwise I feel like I have not completed a journey (good or bad). Anyway, I hated the main character, hated his way, his behaviour, his thoughts, his stupid attitude towards sex and relationships. I hated having read this book. I don't understand how this stupid book turned out to be a movie."
4,A Believable Story About Post 9/11,"Wendy,the 13 year old heroine of this book,is a ""typical"" N.Y teenager with a loving mother and step-dad and younger half-brother. Then the tragic events of 9/11 unfold and her mother disappears while working in one of the Twin Towers.The book really makes you re-live the horror and loss of that day and the girl's grief is belivable,although at times she seems a bit too stoic. (...)In addtion,Wendy meets a lot of other people at a crossroads in their life and that's the main fault of the book,as it should focus more on Wendy and the tragedy of losing her mother at such a young age. The author does show that were not alone in our searching for family connection and a sense of closure,which she herself never truly has(...)A good book to both read and discuss."
4,Coming of Age When the Unthinkable Occurs,"A heartfelt look at the devastating effects of the World Trade Center attack, and its impact on a family.Wendy is 13 years old and living with her step father, younger step brother and mom in Brooklyn NY. On a beautiful day in September her mother leaves for work at the World Trade Center and never returns. We follow along as the family struggles for hope and sinks slowly into acceptance of the tragedy that has befallen them. When Wendy's biological father comes back into her life and takes her away with him to California, Wendy has to find a new set of rules for her life, since the usual rules no longer apply.I was very concerned about reading a book about 9/11, especially since I live right outside of NYC, and experienced first hand the horrors of those days. Ms. Maynard has done a brilliant job of not trivializing the experience, and making us feel so much for all the families left behind. A wonderful book."
5,Rustic Garden Architecture,If you like gardens and nature you will enjoy this book. My girl friend gave it to me and now I am buying a copy for a friend. I have already made one bench from ideas in the book. A must have for the creative gardener
3,You Can Still Fall In Love With Quebec,"""We Fell In Love With Quebec"" is the travel narrative written by a couple who traversed La Belle Province by boat in the late 1940s. Traveling up the Hudson and Lake Champlain they made their way to the St. Lawrence where the plied the waters along which sit the centers, big and small, of French Canada. As the reader floats along with them he partakes in the sights and sounds of Montreal, Trois Rivieres, Quebec and villages too numerous to mention. We read of scenery and people who inhabit this corner of our continent.This book is certainly dated and a contemporary trip along the St. Lawrence would be different from the authors'. Still, the small villages remain and this book gives an insight into the Quebec that was and which, under the surface, still exists. You too can still fall in love with Quebec."
3,Hidden Tahiti: Not all that hidden,"As a two time, three island visitor to the islands of Tahiti, I did not find this book helpful because it lacks prices and it focuses on upscale lodging/food. On both trips, I've found David Stanley's TAHITI (by Moon Pub.) to be the BEST guide, providing you purchase the most recent edition, as Tahiti's hotels change with the seasons. David Stanley's guides are full of detailed maps, reviews of hikes, beaches, accomodations (from hostels to resorts), food... His advice has never steered us wrong! We owe some great travel experiences to his guide book; TAHITI by D. Stanley is the only one that you will need."
5,Not Available?,This is one of the best musical videos ever created for children. How can it be unavailable? My 18 year old enjoyed watching it when my 10 year old was a baby. Now I want to purchase it for my developmentally challenged 15 year old and I can't find it. This is a great video for parents who hate to have to watch kids videos. The entire family will enjoy it.
3,nice,"lot's of information about different artists, but not what i was looking for under ""lace"" ""knitting"". this is a book about contemporary art."
3,manufactured bonzai,"I guess I expected this to not be a very high quality plant but it was a little disappointing to see the really dramatic pruning that was done at some point to get it to be more bonzai-ish. That said, its still very attractive, has a nice silhouette and was very inexpensive. The shipping was extra-awesome as well. It came overnight though I selected super-saver shipping and it was very carefully wrapped and cared for before being boxed."
4,Very Pleased,"This is a super cute book and very detailed. I love the descriptions you are asked to write like Mommy and Daddy's best friends and hobbys. I has a lot of space for pictures and extras, the only thing I wish it had were some pockets to store loose items. I figure I will make some on the many blank pages provided in the back of the book."
4,Some thing I would do,"I loved the book. Almost every mother that this has happened to would do this if they had the means and the chance.I would never allow anyone to take my child, even if a judge ruled it so."
5,Must-buy for string players not least for the bowingchapter,This is one of the great string-playing books. Please buy it and read it---you will not be disappointed.
5,A Five-Star Follow-Up to Her Debut Legal Thriller,"Rose Connor's second crime novel, ""Temporary Sanity,"" picks up where ""Absolute Certainty"" left up. Former ADA Marty Nickerson is now a criminal defense lawyer caught up in defending two accused murderers. The story grabs you from the first page and doesn't let go until the last. Nickerson is a strong, intelligent, and often wryly humorous protagonist who cares deeply about the law and justice. The main storyline, her defense of a father who has killed the murderer of his young son, is compelling and heart-wrenching. The characters are likable and believable, the courtroom scenes are well-drawn, and the threads of the storyline are neatly brought together in a slam-bang climax. Connor's books are a great addition to the legal thriller genre. If you like Perri O'Shaughnessy and Lisa Scottoline, you'll love Rose Connors."
4,Connors Keeps Up the Pace,"I have read both of Connor's books, and enjoyed them thoroughly. As a summer Cape dweller, I heard her speak at a literary event, and found her interesting, down-to-earth, and believable. This book, the second, continues with the main characters that were introduced in the first novel. The plots in both, work well for any mystery, and are not predictable. This is a pleasant suprise, as there are few Cape Cod set novels that avoid being simplistic. Entertaining and well-written summer or winter reading for any legal thriller fan!"
3,Know any cops?,"This is the second in the series & the second that I've read. I'll give it 3 stars for being fairly engaging. Very much like the characters - which is a must for me. BUT, I thought the development of the ""bad"" guy was very weak. The moment when ""all is revealed"" is rather a ""huh?"" moment. However, the two seriously bad scenes are when Marty - armed with her ladies 9mm handgun - follows the cops (1) into a house that may have a killer in it, and, (2) around the jail where the lights have gone out & the killer may be going after someone who is locked in a cell. HUH??? Yeah, right. Anyone with any familiarity with law enforcement knows that you don't do that - unless you have a death wish. So, I'll try the series again sometime - but only because I like the characters and am an audiobook addict."
1,Don't Waste Your Time on This Sequel,"This is the second Marty Nickerson legal mystery and it's no better than the first. There's just no spark here, not much that's original or interesting. The prose is dull, and the characters are unimaginatively drawn. For example, the African American judge, and D.A. J.Stanley Edgerton's relationship with the judge, are very similar to what we saw in Grisham's ""The Client,"" especially the Susan Sarandon movie version; and of course Grisham does it way better. The plot (father kills his young son's murderer) is transparently similar to an actual case where a father killed his daughter's rapist, a case that has been on TV shows like American Justice many times. The subplots, too, were trite and did not compel me to keep reading. I received this and the previous Nickerson novel as gifts: out of politeness I slogged through the first book but couldn't finish this one."
4,Review of Novak Smart Tray,"Works very well. Equalizes well and in a timely fashion. Very solid and durable. Excellent discharge tray at a very, very reasonable price. I would highly recommend it."
1,an ideal look at Bettelheim which is totally wrong,"As a former student at Dr. Bettelheim's school in Chicago, I found this book to be very inadaquate in its description of Dr. Bettelheim. This man did a great deal of harm to the students attending this school and was not the savior which Ms. Sutten would like him to be potrayed as. His methods of treatment can be compared with how the German Nazis treated their concentration camp victims. He did beat the students a great deal and fear was a common, shared, feeling which most of the kids felt towards him. His use of imtimadation towards the children, as well as the staff, was complete. Since Ms. Sutton was not a student at the Orthogenic School, of course she would not know the things that went on there. If Bettelheim was alive today, he would be arrested for child abuse, and this is a fact that Ms. Sutton doesn't want to admit."
3,"The movie was better, and so was Amanda Brown's other book","A huge fan of the Legally Blonde movies and Amanda Brown's other book, Family Trust, reading Legally Blonde the book was a letdown - the characters and the plot seemed much shallower in the book than in the movie."
4,"Good, but the movie is better","This is one of the rare cases where the movie is better than the book. The author states that the book is based on her experiences at Stanford law, but as a recent law school grad, I find the book unbelievable at some points. For example, Elle takes all of her classes pass/fail. As far as I know, the American Bar Association doesn't allow first year classes to be taken pass/fail. And as helpful as outlines are, they are no substitute for class attendance (which is required in law school, or you fail automatically) and studying!The movie portrays Elle as a smart girl who works hard to get what she wants, the book portrays her as more of a spoiled brat who gets lucky.... I much prefer the former! Movie Elle wants to help everyone, book Elle only wants to help herself and other blondes.If you have seen the movie, you don't need to read the book, the movie is better."
1,BOOOOOOOO! Horrible writing!,"Welcome to world of writing well, oh wait not so fast Amanda Brown. How they got the movie from this book is beyond me. The book was trite and poorly written. With dollar words thrown in to prove that Ms. Brown went to law school. Boring and pointless. I couldn't even finish it. The book which I assume was supposed to be funny was in fact not. So all of you save your pennies and don't buy this book. Go buy The Nanny Diaries, or something worthwhile that will challenge your mind with out trying to make you feel inferior. Stay out of the literary world Ms. Brown, and I'll stay out of the law world."
2,Could have been better,"This was an interesting book. The writing (and editing) weren't really that great, but I was expecting a bit more substance.The author gave an overview of mercenary operations over an extended period of history and then gave relatively short shrift to current operations, particulalry in Iraq, where PMC's (Private Military Companies) are making sinful amounts of money out of the ongoing debacle in Iraq.The author doesn't appear to have an agenda with this book, other than to get published and make money the sad thing is that with a little more homework and fact checking, he could have done something special."
1,Hack job,"This book is poorly researched, and in my opinion, poorly written.You would think that because of Fred Rosen's background as an investigative reporter he would have done an in depth investigation of his subject matter. This is not the case.His retelling of the war in Angola is so full of errors and omissions that I don't know why he bothered.Mr. Rosen - next time leave it to Anthony Mockler."
1,Lost Cause,"As with previous reviewers, I was a Quicken 99 user and it was a waste of time and money to do the upgrade. Intuit clearly has lost touch with their customer base and fails to incorporate any value into their new, updated products. One would wonder who actually is at the helm of their product development department. Obviously, customer satisfaction takes a serious backseat to corporate profits. Sadly, their consistant downslide and destruction of what was a superior product is an embarrassment to Intuit. As a corporate professional, I would wonder why no senior management officers haven't stepped in to stop the demise of product quality and image. Quicken 99 WAS excellent."
1,Waste of time,Been using quicken for a number of years. They have ruined a slick program... Buy MS MOney
3,"Help, Can't Register This Program!","Yes, it's a good product, but I simply cannot register this product! It keeps sending ""connection unsuccesful"" messages whenever I attempt to send my information. I figure it has to do with the fact that I have direct internet connection. Geez!"
1,Not true to its title,"I found this book very disappointing. Its title is 1001 more humorous Illustrations for Public Speaking.I found a lot of the content is not suitable for public speaking unless you are a preacher. A lot is in preaching. But I doubt whether many preachers would want to use it.I wanted to use it in my public speaking club. Much is not appropriate for that setting.I found it bemusing that quite a bit of the book is not appropriate for a preacher to use either.Although the book was only published in 1998, it had an old feel.I would not recommend this for public speaking."
1,WORST GAME EVER!!!,This game was so amazingly bad that i almost threw my computer out the window. Horrible graphics and bad multiplayer action if there was any. After about three levels you get stuck and can't go anywhere. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME you will be seriously dispointed in you're self and wish you hadn't wasted 15 bucks on it
5,Worked great!,"With a bad case of the flu, I ended up with Pink Eye. Per the doctor and all the reference books I checked, homeopathic ways were the best course of action. This eased and soothed the irritation and itching that accompanies pink eye in addition to warm cotton pads soaked in chamomile tea. I'd recommend to adults since I can't imagine kids sitting for an hour without touching irritated eyes."
5,better than expected,"My first experience with this product was when I ordered it at 5:00 in the morning one day and found it had been delivered by 3:00 the NEXT day! How great is that?! It was easy to install and it works beautifully. We cool about 800 sq feet with this one unit. I bought two different units, a 10000 and 5000 BTU, to cool that space and found this one unit is enough. (My daughter was happy as I gave her the other one!) It is quiet enough that we can hear the TV easily over it. I have a couple other Haier products and continue to be very pleased with them. For great quality and price this AC unit can't be beat."
4,Decisions,"Marty Nickerson is a dedicated prosecutor for the DA's office on Cape Cod. As this debut novel opens, she is wrapping up a murder case, with absolute certainty that the defendant is guilty. When a similar murder occurs the day after the trial ends, she's still certain that the state has its man. But public defender Harry Madigan, an attorney whom Mary admires, is convinced the opposite is true. The reader is privy to Ms. Nickerson's thought process as she sifts and resifts through evidence, considers and reconsiders, consulting privately with Harry as the situation grows more intense.It has become a trend in recent years to write about professional disillusionment. Author Connors does so with refreshing style, penning terse courtroom segments, office infighting, and family/personal scenes with skill. She needs more work with creating genuine suspense, but three out of four's not bad. Good first effort."
1,Very Dangerous: Very Out-Of-Date,"This book is from 2002...might as well be from another galaxy with the changes in the IT field since then.Many of the companies mentioned in this book are out of business or severely shrunk. Look at Interwoven (NASDAQ: IWOV), for example: book talks about people getting BMWs. Well, maybe when their stock was at nearly 200...not so much at 12.Amazon really shouldn't even list this book, it's so obsolete."
2,Failed Parody,"_The Swoop_ is a parody of invasion stories common in Britain at the turn of the twentieth century, but (like Wodehouse's earlier parody, _William Tell Told Again_) it fails completely. A parody is supposed to exaggerate some existing characteristic of its target to the point of absurdity; Wodehouse instead introduces a brand new absurdity, the peaceful but childish conduct of nine separate invading armies. Except for one brief joke about the London County Council which will resonate with modern residents of London, it fails completely to grip or to amuse. Wodehouse's very next book, _Mike_, was a turning point in his career, with its introduction of the character Psmith. The only interest in _The Swoop_ for modern readers is to accentuate the contrast with his vintage work."
1,Diversity Review,This book is good in giving an overview of the history but it falls short in balancing current thought with practical approaches to diversity. I would like to see proven techniques in creating diversity in organizations and achieve superior productivity in the marketplace.
5,The best book of its kind.,"As a former hospice chaplain, I appreciate Dunn's straighforward work. It is an invaluable resource for both professional caregivers and patients and their families. The ""hard choices"" are dealt with honestly and thoroughly. This is an informative guide that will provide the help people in crises need at a time when they are most ready to listen."
1,"all talk, no data",A couple of good articles on primer testing but otherwise this book was almost devoid of any data. It was just a few guys sitting around talking. I regret buying it.
4,They Whisper,"Beautiful language; slightly erotic. Interesting perspective on women from a male point of view. About two-thirds of the way through it becomes a bit boring, but continue reading. It has an interesting view at the end."
2,eh,"really not that interesting, neither one of my kids really cared for it much, not very stimulating."
2,Not Impressed,"I ordered this as a Christmas present for my 4 month old son. I am not impressed. I thought it would be a great toy because I love the Whoozit but it isn't that great. The ""tag"" fabric is the same as the fabric for the handles and it appears to be like very thin windbreaker fabric. It doesn't rattle or make any noises that are easy for an infant to initiate. The dangling star on the inside is on a very short string, about 1 inch, so unless you pull it out on the side it is sewn on it won't hang outside of the ball. You have to pull the Whoozit from the inside which is also on a short string to get it to vibrate. The whole ball doesn't vibrate, just the Whoozit. And it's not super easy to pull on either. On the opposite side of the vibrating Whoozit is a squeaker. I'm going to see how my son reacts to this toy but I'm pretty sure I'm just going to return it."
4,"It's cheap and it works, BUT .......","It saves me alot of time stripping 10-20 conductor cabling for wiring in controls panels, but I had to modify it first. Stripping along the length of the cable works fine but when you want to strip the jacket you have to thread the cable through a hole. I guess that's fine for 1/0 terminations of 1""-2"" but for controls cabling or lighting its anywhere for 2-6' depending on the customer guidelines, so it's tedious to thread it through then back out. I'll post pics later, I cut the front of the cable stripper guide hole so I could just slide the cables in and out of the tool. It it had came this way I would have given 5 stars, because now its a 5 star tool."
1,Don't buy this,This toy is a waste of time and a space taker upper. Not very user friendly. Jumpstart games for your computer are a much better buy.
5,"Great product, great price",I love shopping on Amazon. I can find hard to find items easily and at a great price. I've been wanting one of these but had no idea where to buy one. I could compare products and prices and love that I can see through the bag. Perfect size.
1,Compressor Broke within 5 months,"Less than 5 months ago I purchased one of these Jumpstart/Compressors at Kragen Auto Parts. It had a defective pressure gauge, so I immediately returned it and exchanged it for another. Today, after having only been used a few brief times to inflate tires, the compressor gave out. I also noted that one of the LED work lights was out.I just read the details of their 2 year warranty and discovered that I was required to ship the unit back to them at my expense along with a money order for $19.95.I will not be doing so."
4,Quality Ear-Buds and Case,"The wind-case and volume control make this compact set worth the small investment. The sound quality is equal to, or better than, any similar priced ear-buds. I like the equal length wires and the wind-up device is easy to use. I just ordered another for my wife's MP3. great for travel or going to the gym."
3,just okay,These headphones are pretty much on par with what you get with an ipod - they do have volume control but they pop out of your ears pretty easily. I don't use the wind up case at all - purchased an inexpensive set of Sony earbuds for my kids and they are much better!!
3,This is NOT a Taraf de Haidouks album,"Although the word ""Taraf"" appears in the title of this album, this is NOT an album by the band Taraf de Haidouks, nor does it claim to be. It is a compilation of Rom tunes by village musicians."
3,"Great writing in parts, overall as bloated as the main character","I should like this book more than I do. Shteyngart is a very funny writer and usually, Falstaffian/Gargantuan lead characters work for me big time. But ultimately, this book is all about asides and sight gags that get to be repititive after about 100 pages. There is no real plot or arc to the narrative. It just goes on and on and on and what seems funny at first starts to turn into a snooze.This book is really a bloated short story. As someone below noted, the short story that apparently was the basis for this book is much, much better. It was hilarious. Reading this book is like watching a mediocre comedy in a movie theater after seeing its two minute, joke-filled trailer. You feel a bit cheated.Mr. Shteyngart has a lot of talent. He just needed a better idea to sustain him for the length of a novel."
1,confederacy of dunces it's not,"Like many of the reviewers, I thought of Ignatius P. Riley when I first read the description of Misha, the lead character. However, as I read on, the similarity ended at the physical description. I struggled to decide if this character was bathetic or pathetic. Unfortunately, there was nothing at all sympathetic, likable or intelligible about this character or what passed for a plot, so he, and the book, were pathetic. I don't know if you have to be a Russian emigre to appreciate the purported humor, but being two generations removed from my Jewish Russian roots, I could not find the humor. The crude offense, however, was easy to find; rarely a page without some. I should have followed my instinct and quit on this book half-way through."
2,Colorful but Empty,"Okay, mad props for the author's wild imagination. He maps his own weird land where ethnic rivalries of the Caucusus collide with hiphop and Halliburton. But after a while, the comedy gets heavy-handed, and part of that is the sense of willed hilarity. It's as if someone sat down with friends and said, ""What if we updated Confederacy of Dunces? Dude, let's make him not just grossly fat and slobby and obnoxious, but Jewish! And Russian! And better than that, he likes hiphop! He even calls his sweetie Boo."" You get my drift. We travel many miles in this book, from the Bronx to St. Petersburg and back and to the shores of the Caspian, but while the world around him goes to pieces, nothing changes for the narrator, despite a half-hearted attempt at epiphany on the author's part. Lots of sound and fury here, but you know what that signifies. . . ."
2,interesting premise but only if you persist to the end of this sophomoric tome,"I had trouble making it through this silly book. Not nearly as political as the reviews had led me to believe.I've given it a ""2"" for the idea, but if you're going to pay full price, consider my review a ""1"" star."
2,Better read the New Yorker short story and save your money,To those intending to buy the book I recommend the short story by the author published in the New Yorker a couple of months ago as a teaser. It is 6 pages long and contains 95% of the good stuff of the book. I bought the book following the short story and was disappointed.
3,funny but....,"Although this author has a wonderful sense of humor and an amazing writing style, I never felt fully engaged with this book. The major point of the whole adventure remained obscure (aka the ""so what?"" factor). It is offensive to many, many different ethnic groups in a way that is both funny and painful. I don't recommend it."
3,Ignatius Reilly meets Alexander Portnoy,"I read this book eagerly after hearing amusing things about it on NPR. I finished it relatively quickly, so it must have been truly amusing. However, I caution that if you didn't sympathize with the protagonist of Portnoy's complaint, you're even less likely to find his modern Russian counterpart to be worthy of compassion. I enjoyed the book, and will remember certain sections of it as illustrations of post-Soviet chaos, but I didn't like the characters and I was not laughing at, or uplifted by the book's content."
1,Patheticstan,"Been a long time since I read a book so self-indulgent and sophomoric; the writing is ham-fisted at best. E.g., try this for a drinking game...have a shot of cheap Russian vodka everytime the word **khui** is mentioned.Basically, when a girl has to tell you she's pretty, she's not. As in, count the number of review blurbs and testimonials.A disappointing waste of time and $13.95. Buyer beware."
3,Sophomore slump,"I have to admit that I'm not sure how many books that Mr. Shteyngart has actually written but this is the second I've read, the other being The Russian Debutante's Handbook.Clearly a good writer, and one willing to take chances, in the first effort the reaches worked better, at least to my taste, and the cleverness was fresh. Absurdistan reaches into and across cultures and often rips the fabric in a way that borders on offensive. It is the temptation to be too clever at times that get in the way of the prose and characters, sometimes it makes you smile and others it makes you cringe, and maybe that is the goal.It is hard to stay the brash young voice, ask Capote or Easton Ellis, but my expectation is that Mr. Shteyngart will be back better than ever."
4,Whimsy farce,"""Absurdistan"" is absurd in many ways - it's an absurdly funny satire of an absurd, but realistic world. There's absurd narrative, an absurd protagonist, absurd characters, absurd dialogue --- all of that works but then there is the absurd plot and absurd ending that don't work very well at all. Greatness would have been achieved with a little more attention played to the storyline. Occasionally there are setups in the plot such as when Misha Vainberg, the protagonist, becomes the Minister of Multi-Cultural Affairs in Absurdistan, and you think, at last, he's been put in a position to do something that advances the story. But he doesn't really. He just stumbles from scene to scene, never moving from passive to active. But it's still a delight to read, because it's so hilarious."
2,GROSS-ly Overrated,"This book fails on at least two major levels.First, it tries for an over-the-top, in-your-face, cutting-edge quality. This is why Absurdistan is on many Ten-Best lists. However, the author is just not talented enough to pull it off - a John Irving wannabe.Second, depiction of the grotesque is risky business. As odd as it sounds, it must be done with finesse or it becomes virtually unreadable (which is the case here). For a positive example, check out Salinger.The only true appeal I could discern was the setting. Eastern Europe in the 21st century is a very interesting part of the world and it ALMOST makes this novel worth reading."
2,"Funny for the first 50 pages, painfully boring after that","The author's writing style is humorous at first. I was reminded of Confederacy of Dunces, and recommended the book to some friends. Now I'm ten pages away from finishing the book, and struggling to reach the end. The jokes have been recycled 100 times, the plot is completely uninteresting, and the political insinuations extremely cliched. Thus, I'm left with nothing to be gained from finishing this book. I've since retracted my recommendation to my friends to read it, but told them it's worth borrowing from me to read the first 50 pages."
2,Uneven,"Insufferably precious here, bold and assured there, this ends up a fairly middling read. Shteyngart pours on the provincialisms and cutesy characterizations, but his themes are strongly developed. A better editor would've cleft away the fat."
4,Gigabit Ethernet ExpressCard Review,The internal LAN card in my laptop was going bad and I needed a quick fix. The Belikn card has performed so much better than the internal card that I am not going to replace it. I will continue to use the Belkin for my business demo's.
2,Leaks water everywhere,"For the first few times a used this, it was great. However, after a few uses it began leaking water everywhere from the mouth piece. After a bike ride my left side will be completely soaked with water. It's not like it dumps water out, but its a very slow & steady leak. It's a waste of money."
3,Some Good Some Bad,"Some of these videos were great. However, two of them were older videos and I couldn't hear the commentary over the background music. It seemed that they mixed these improperly and someone reversed which sound should have been louder. They are still good for watching, but Warren Miller's humor is lost due to not being able to hear what he is saying."
5,"""Night of the Iguana""","I ordered the Iguana puppet for a play production of ""Night of the Iguana."" The actors who ""capture"" the iguana are loving the little fellow. The iguana is just the right size. Because he is a puppet, he can be manipulated to look ""real"" to the audience. After the play is over, the puppet will find a new home with my three little grandsons who are 7,5, and 3!"
2,Adoration or Aberration?,Not a big fan of this film. Very preachy and dull. It takes it's sweet time unveiling the story to you which is interesting until you realize it doesn't have much to offer in the first place. Strongly suggest renting before a purchase. I blind bought and lost.
2,Frozen Out,"This is not really a fair film review, since two of the middle scenes were frozen and unwatchable on the DVD I rented. From what I did manage to see, this is a convoluted mishmash of political correctness, societal preaching, surreality and child abuse. Can't really recommend it based on the unfortunately abbreviated version that I saw."
4,Great zombie flick,This is a great movie for the zombie buff. it's a serious movie and although I didn't like the end much i thought the ford brothers did an awesome job with it. Great quality production with the slower moving zombies like Romero.A must watch for the zombie fan.
4,"Surpringly, good","I was pleased by this film, enough zombies to keep one happy, and a good story. I have added it to my collection."
3,It's an average zombie film,"Honestly, I don't think there's anything special about this zombie flick. There isn't much action, it's more about the ""journey"" than anything else really. There are moments when I thoroughly enjoyed this movie but a majority of the time, there's nothing new.In conclusion, it's a decent film but nothing new that we haven't seen time and time again. Though it should be noted that it is a zombie film so there isn't much to diverge from, besides the typical running for your life and avoiding zombie hot spots."
2,I actually fell asleep,I read some reviews of this movie saying how great it was but I really should have read them all. After buying the Blu Ray last week I watched it last night along with a few friends. The general consensus was that this was one of the most boring Zombie flicks we have ever seen. The plot was pretty much non existent and it moved as slow as the zombies themselves. Which were slowest I think I have seen in any movies newer than the 70s. I wish I would have saved my money and got this from RedBox
3,Indeterminate Ending,"This move was satisfactory as zombie type movies go. My main criticism was the ending. Unlike the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"", we can clearly see that the survivors did not make it because the video camera captures their being over-run. In ""The Dead"" it seems that the writers weren't really sure what to do so they did nothing.The characters just stood there, expressionless. Good up to that point."
2,A little disappointed,"I have to say with all the garbage out there today this was refreshing as it is a fairly realistic look at what a zombie outbreak in Africa would resemble.That being said it was a bit on the boring side,slow moving. Its worth a look and if you're a die hard fan of the genre then its worth adding to your collection but for me it was a ""one time watch"" only"
1,No story whatsoever,"Some people go their whole lives and never figure out the difference between stuff happening, and actual story. These are those people. Providing movement on a screen and informing the audience that things are happening on that screen is not the same as providing plot, people."
4,Excellent film,"This is an excellent film, beautifully photographed with interesting characters, good acting and production values. and plenty of zombie gore and excitement. I was a little disappointed in the ending, but the endings to zombie movies are generally unsatisfying. It is nice to see an intelligent adult zombie film."
4,This film terrified me....,"because it was so somber and realistic. It's not a grab and bite zombie flick, although there's lots of that....it's a realistic look at how helpless most people are in the face of any emergency, even those with military training. It also makes you give deep and serious thought as to where you might be when a world changing event occurs. Not a cheap thrill film, but a thoughtful, thought provoking take on the zombie genre. A somehow lonely movie, as well."
2,long and boring,"I just kinda thought not much happened, there was no intensity. I always wonder in movies like this how people can't get away from slow moving zombies? I know a lot of people think it is refreshing to have some old school zombie action, I guess I prefer mine on steroids."
1,The Boring!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was really excited to see a new zombie movie coming out and with all the good reviews it was getting, I thought alright......finally one that might actually be good. But to my dismay, this movie was BORING....no plot, no character development, no NOTHING!!!!! The only good thing about the movie was the few really good special effects scenes in it. I couldn't believe I sat through an hour and forty-five minute movie that just literally bored the hell out of me!!!! Yes it was that bad!!!! I would not recommend buying this movie...if you want to see it, rent it through Redbox before you do, so you don't waste your hard earned money on this crap."
1,BAD BAD BAD,Please for the love of god just don't watch it. They were all black zombies that moved at the pace of a snail.
1,Incredibly overpriced,"($$$) for a compilation of back-catalog tracks? This is the most overpriced album I've seen yet.If you're a fan, you already have all the tracks. If you become a fan, you'll want to go buy all the albums anyway, for all the great tracks that aren't included here--like ""Kiss Me Son of God"", an all time favorite of the fans I know. And if you're not a big fan, why spend so much cash on a compilation?"
1,comes up short,"What trekstor doesn't tell you is that the MP3 player's chipset can administrate 480 files maximum. What this means is that even if you try to fill up this player with 1000 mp3 files at 64 kBit/s each (~2GB), you'll only be able to access less than 480. The number 480 seems to include all folders, sub-folders and files. My capacity was 371 files, even though when plugged into the PC, I had 500 songs."
5,only one thing to be said,I was pleased to see this book by an author from my home state of Oklahoma. It is as good as one could hope it might be. Oneness is a good title because there is truly only one thing to be said- that we can rest our awareness in the space of awareness which is the same in everyone. That space is without the needs or wants that drive us crazy with desire. All the contortions of spiritual discipline occurs because we either can't accept or ignore this simple truth.
2,Give this one a miss,"I will keep this short because there isn't a lot to say. This movie could be kind of interesting, well at least the premise ""could"" work. Unfortunately the script is awful and the acting is lame.The cast is actually quite good so I can only assume that the director, producer and everyone else are either incompetent or just didn't care.The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because Lucy Liu is so gorgeous."
2,Marginal rental material,"I watched this rental in a brain candy frame of mind. If not for my girlfriend and a Stinger or two, the basic 20 minute rule would have kicked in and despite some lush camera work and one or two well done scenes, the predictable dialogue and slow pace would have would have sent me to bed. 2 stars is a reasonable rating - unless you're a blood drinking fan."
1,Save your money! This movie SUCKS!!!!!,This movie was a waste of time...the only thing that made it watchable was Lucy Lui naked...that's it. And whats a Vampire movie with no fangs?
2,Movie Review,This is going to be the shortest review I have ever done!This film was a ...................... sleeper. It is so awful that I can remember NOTHING from it and I have suffered through it twice!
3,a gentle wind...,"His voice sounds great... the album sounds good... but it's just all a little too... soft around the edges. Yes, he throws a few mild political slogans in here....(""Let's get out of Iraq and get back on track, let's rebuild America first."") The band is solid. But it sounds so produced and slick that it has no... edge... especially remembering Hag's live show opening for Dylan here a while back... something seems to be missing in the studio. Hell, some of the songs even FADE OUT (ug!) However this is still a cut above the anemic Unforgettable and I think Merle has a few more good albums left in him... perhaps a live album would be a good next move..."
1,I'd be humiliated if I was the pilot in this book,The author gives a bad name to professional pilots. The antics of the characters in this book would only appeal to young guys who like to party and drink. Everyone has to start somewhere so maybe the author will improve as he goes along.
5,Great Item,Was well pleased with the item I purchased. I bought it as a gift and was well satisfied. Was shipped very fast.
2,Relaxation CD,"I haven't enjoyed this CD as much as I expected. I know it said that for relaxation it was best not to have any recurring melodies, but I find it a little too different for my tastes."
3,Dreams,"I purchased this CD for the same reason that most do...insomnia. I do not want to depend on pills or artificial means to sleep. I read the reviews of this CD on Amazon and decided that it sounded pretty good. The first night I listened to it, I did fall asleep and slept for a record 6 hours straight! But then the next night I fell asleep and woke up terrified by gruesome dreams. I thought it might be coincidence, so I listened the next night. Again, I fell asleep, but woke up with nightmares. And this time I could not get back to sleep...I stayed awake, feeling jittery...wired. I have gone back to one of my many meditation/guided imagery CDs. I know they are safe!"
2,Sleep Soundly,"Did not feel relaxed or sleepy. It is a lovely piece, but it did not relax me enough to put me into a sound sleep."
1,Brand New CD SKIPS,"I bought this CD to help me fall asleep at night, to help me relax. The music is exactly what I want but right after opening the CD and putting it into my CD player, it SKIPS! I listened to it maybe one night but it kept skipping so I tossed the thing. Not worth the money."
4,creativity at its best,"I really enjoyed this CD. Lately, the genre of salsa has been disappointing. The music has a commercial sound to it, most of it seems to be aimed to attract a certain age group. In that sense, this CD was refreshing. It is combined elements of cuban music i.e. mambo,guaguanco, son...add jazz elements to this mix and you get a unique and pleasing sound. I would recommend this CD to anyone."
1,waste of time,I watched the preview of this film and thought it looked interesting. It was far from what I expected. I watched very intently for the entire length of the film and expected that possibly the end may give some clue of the point they were trying to convey. I was sadly mistaken. Glad I didn't go to the theatre to see it. Should have waited for it to come out on netflix. This is where films this bad go to fade into obscurity. If you are going watch this film make sure you don't pay for it.
3,observation,"i was a little dissapointed in this book because i didn't want to read a biography, i wanted more technical information"
5,An excellent effort. Highly recommended.,The editor has brought together a good selection of articles from first class shooters. I haven't put it down since I bought it. The info on scopes taught me a lot more than I know. Not perhaps for the unambitious beginner. This will be a standard reference work in your library. Buy it.
4,A nice change of pace,Usually Harlequins have a bunch of characters that fall into the too stupid to live category. Most of the time the women are mentally challenged with a serious lack of maturity and the men are emotionally challenged bordering on abusive. This book was different. Everyone acted like adults and were examples of how good things can be if common sense is used. This book felt real to me and made me smile. You could see why the characters fell in love with each and looks had very little to do with it. They were good people and I felt this was a marriage destined to last unlike other Harlequins where it was a divorce waiting to happen.
5,Your Inner Doll,Loved it. Great for those who love to dance. A good challenge. Miss Antin does a wonderful job with cues. Buy it.
4,Fun!,"I was so excited for this DVD.I tried it yesterday, it did make me sweat! It's pretty good, I agree some changes can be made but overall it's fun flirty and I like the moves"
3,It's misleading,"It's called The Pussycat Dolls Workout and I saw the video promo and Nicole talks about the workout so I thought I would see the actual Pussycat Dolls and I didn't! It is the creator/choreographer of the Dolls and some other girls. Nicole is and invited guest and does one song with them.The workout is good, they do the actual choreography of the Dolls but it's only 3 songs which is disappointing. They do DON'T CHA, BUTTONS and some BURLESQUE-style dance."
2,"Fun and sexy, but useless","This video teaches the moves, but it is nothing close to a workout. I did the entire dvd and hardly broke a sweat. There are way better workout dvds out there, but this one ok for some fun sexy moves."
4,Feeling It!!!,"I have some weight to lose and used to dance all the time so this was an awesome buy for me. I know a lot of people don't like that they're short routines...but its so that you get it and so that you get good at it. If you're trying to learn the entire time instead of putting your energy into it, you're just not going to get the same benefits. Its fun, peppy, very sexy, and you can follow it. If you've never danced before, you should at least be able to get a lot of it down and you WILL be able to get it after a few times. Then you can really hit it and make it strong. I'll be throwing it into my rotation for those days when I don't want just ""cardio"" and I want to dance instead. Helps the workout go by a lot faster too!Also....this is my husband's account haha."
4,Cute but small,"The little pup is cute, but hardly big enough to really be as effective as I hoped. Very fast shipment! I gave it 4 stars just for cuteness. The lack of back legs kind of creeps me out though."
4,Wonderful and soothing,"This CD is for anyone who is love or wishes to be. I found the content of this music very sexy, although quite clean in delivery. It evokes the feeling of romance in it's purest form."
3,So Much Has Changed,"This book is a good start, but so much has changed in post 86 Fiesta... items, colors added and discontinued, prices. An update is desperately needed. Also a bit less ""filler"" as far as stories and dramatic exposition and more emphasis on actual introductions and discontinuations in the new line. Also, so many competing lines are similar... a back of the book section showing other contemporary dinnerware lines that currently compete with Fiesta.My biggest suggestion would be a chapter showing comparison of old versus new items to show the evolution of design...1.e. the old casserole versus the new one, old cup next to new one. Many collectors of the new do not appreciate where the design evolved fromAlso, the only decaled ware shown is...well.. the less said the better about what is shown... where are the artistic and popular patterns like Sunporch, Happy Pumpkin and Moon Over Miami?"
1,a bunch of overated sacriligious garbage,"South Park is a show that everyone seems to love. I love Family Guy with its ""adult humor"" but I seriously found no humor in South Park. I tried to get into it, but all the jokes were lame, stupid, and the characters were annoying with their weird shapes and annoying voices. On top of it, the humor in this show is way over the top and seriously sacriligious. Jesus in a boxing match against the devil getting his but kicked? Come on! The passion of the Jew? This is trash and I'm ashamed that our country enjoys it. So, you know what, give me 0 out of 800 helpful votes because all of you love it but at least, I spoke my thoughts on this awful show."
1,Got a disease and died,We don't like these Hawaiian umbrellas. We have had 3 and 2 (including this one) have caught some sticky fungus and died. We will not buy another.
5,Mark W. Smith Has Done it Again!,"Proving that he is becoming one of America's leading conservative voices, Smith's analysis addresses head-on the real dangers posed by the liberal courts. The book is clear, insightful, entertaining and leaves the reader with an arsenal of ideas to combat the judiciary's eroding of traditional American values. Smith has written a thought provoking and credible look at our courts today while providing a blueprint for proactive efforts to ""right"" American jurisprudence. Well done!"
3,not bad,"please remember it is automatic, therefore if left alone for long periods u will need to reset this watch, and might fool you in thinking the watch is not working. but not bad"
4,my father wears it all the time,i bought this jacket for my father a few years ago and he wears it all the time. it is warm and waterproof. he really likes it a lot. i only wish that it had a detachable hood.
3,Manga With A Message,"This is a slightly different type of manga in which the reader follows the adventures of a young man, named Rei, who rescues a puppy - only to discover that it can talk as it is a magical being that offers to train Rei.In the first book (simply titled ""Passage 1: Poverty - A Ray of Light""), Rei meets a young woman named Ayeesha whose husband was badly injured in a war and they do not have the money to feed their children. Rei's past of stealing the food he needs to survive on the streets begins to haunt him as he meets the family.This is a very short manga (the only real reason I gave it a low score), but it is also a good one. The story itself is only about 32 pages long with an addition 3 pages of info about poverty and how one can help.""1 World Manga"" is creation of Viz Media and The World Bank. While older manga fans might find its short tale a bit boring and lacking of entertainment, it will be more suited to the younger crowd (pre-High School)."
4,Hard to please Eater,"My ""hard to please"" eater has finally decided to eat her dog food and to stop begging at the table since I started giving her the new Evo small bite dog food. Plus it is rated as one of the top commercial dog foods."
5,Top Rated,"I found this dog food after reading the reviews a[...].This earned their top category - 6 stars, for Premium Dry Food. We have a very picky Pomeranian and she loves it"
1,Don't buy,"They give you a pack of three because you'll need them!! The first one broke the third day I used it. The second one broke three weeks later. The third one I kept strictly for travel and it lasted four days in to my trip. I had purchase a small non-folding hair brush from a local third world drug store, It works great and has not broke yet.. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!!"
1,Don't need it in PINK,It mentions it would be possible to get this in another color. IT DOES NOT SAY color is sellers choice.I love this type of brush to carry in my pocket for my long beard.. I really could do without the pink brushes that I was sent.
3,What?,"I thought that this was a good book. However,the ending left me hanging in the breeze. The begining and middle, were great, but the ending stopped just suddenly, with no follow up. I would have included what happend to her father. All in all, good book, bad ending."
5,A very inspirational story,"I rember reading this book when I was in the 5th grade. I was in the public libary, and I choose it because the cover was very interesting. But when I took it home, it took me to world war 2, where there was a war in Asia other than the one between Jpan, Europe, and America. It showed me what it was like for a young girl close to my age who had to survive through many disasters after another. Out of all the books I read when I was younger, this one stands out the most in my mind, and here I am 15. Yes, it was depressing but it was such a great book. I felt like I was Yoko. Then book was so emotional that I cried and rejoyced. Thanks to this book, it got me interested in the culture of Japan, and history. I now intend to live there at some point in my life, and am curently studing the language on my own time. I love this book, and I'd recomend it to any little girl, or boy."
1,Costly piece of Junk!!,"My daughter got this from her grandparents for a birthday present. I am not a seamstress, but I know how to set up a sewing machine properly. My daughter spent hours trying to figure this thing out. I managed to get everything set up except for the bobbin area. I managed to snap the thread 6 times and still have not been able to thread it effectively. This really isn't the best machine to be learning on, go to a thrift store and purchase one from there instead or try your local freecycle. I think her grandparents paid $50 CDN, total waste-o-money. We cant even send it back because we mangled the box trying to get to the machine. I give this 0 out of 5 stars, don't waste your money on this mess."
3,Help??,"I would love to tell you how this product works, but I can't for the life of me figure out how to thread the bobbin! If anyone can tell me, I would really appreciate it. I did find one manual online, but it said to flip up a lid, and my daughters machine doesn't appear to have a lid, just a little ""stopper"" that you pull off to reveal the bobbin (pin?) but I can't figure out how to get it to come up?"
2,Do not buy,I just bought this for my two daughters 5 and 6. I have been sewing for a hobby for over 20 years. I was skeptical when I bought this - it is terrible. The tension does not work. Threading the needle is extremely difficult - the hole is very small and it is in an very awkward position - took me over 1/2 hour to do it. The only thing that is cute about this machine is its looks - I am returning it after only having it one day - I saved my receipt. I think any other parent will have the same trouble with it.
2,A book about a book,"As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a book about a book (3:16). The last chapter and the panel discussion form the meat of the book. What is more, existence of God is an axiom, and words like ""God' will"", ""God's children"" are tossed around frequently. If you are uncomfortable with that and have come to this book hoping that a world reknowned computer scientist would share his thoughts on these fundamental questions (such as whether God exists and if He does, does he have a plan for us etc.), you would be disappointed."
5,A fantastic re-imagining of the Marvel Universe,"I was skeptical about the premise of this series. Marvel heroes in the age of Elizabeth? But this series really delivers. There are dozens of characters, so there's a good chance that your favorite character gets significant treatment, but more importantly, the story is fresh and exciting, with just the right combination of mystery and intrigue. I especially liked how the books focused on the characters, their relationship to each other and to their time, and not just on set fight-pieces, which, in my opinion, dominate too many superhero comics. The action sequences are there and they're good, but they don't distract from a terrific story. Highly recommended!"
4,Two are better than one,Purchased to be a desk monitor for a laptop. Works well has good color and clarity for a good price.
1,don't buy if you only own 64bit OS computers,"This game is fun, as I have played it before, but it will not work on my computer or laptop. All of my computers are Vista and Windows 7. This causes a major problem as the game simply will not work with these operating systems. So in order to play I will have to find an old version of windows, repartition my hard drive and dual boot my computer. The description should advise you of this."
5,Oishii!,"We love soba during the summer, and this sauce is delicious. It is the perfect companion for the soba noodles we love, and even our little one appreciates its tangy yumminess. Definitely recommended for those who love soba!"
5,Much More Mayhem!,"Great disc! Although a few more songs from ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" could have been included, this is a great disc for the family, or the grown-up who Grew Up with these songs."
1,listen to it when you get it ... might not get what you ordered,Bought this CD for my niece while I was out of town and when I got back I opened it. A few days later I put the CD in the CD player and thought it sounded strange but had to go to work. Thought maybe there was something wrong with my CD player but I tried it on 2 different players. By this time I had passed my 30day return time. I contacted the people I order it from and they said it was to late. I just wanted a replacement but no luck.Listen to it all before your 30days are up!!!
3,Interesting but analysis a bit glib,"As an economist with interest in (economic) history I was curious to read this book and compare with others that touch on this very fascinating subject of causes of long-term growth. There has been a spate of books on macro-socioeconomic history especially from late 70s onward (North, E. Jones, Gress etc) and this one fits in that series. I found the book well-written in journalistic style and sometimes funny. It gives a good and lively overview of economic and social history. The analysis I found less convincing and not very deep or penetrating, relying on cases or 'just-so' history. Some statements using economics (such as 'work is better than wealth') were frankly very puzzling to me. That said, as a popularizing book on history and economics is still has merit. But it is especially the style rather than content that earns it 3 stars."
5,Worth re-reading,"We have all seen the results of self-destructive culture on friends who fall in to the 'drug scene', or perhaps family members who become lost in a cult. What happens when destructive or backward cultures operate at a larger scale, at the scale of nations? The Wealth and Poverty of Nations examines in historical context this thesis in a brilliant fashion. I have just re-read it after many years and find it very current in a world where we hear Europeans today talk of a balanced budget as an 'austerity budget'!! Culture matters and cultures can and do change over time."
1,Very Misleading,"This is one of the most narrow analyses of history that I have ever read. The author deals with an extremely selective range of history and rather than seeking answers to the question posed, the book is a pulpit for the author's personal opinions which are passed of as historical inevitibility. It is the worst kind of history - result based and biased. The author seems to endorse every historian prior to 1940 - basically colonial, while dismissing any modern analysis as tainted by political correctness. Lots of facts, no analysis and a mere expression of opinion- a much better book on the topic is Jared Diamond's Guns Germs and Steel, which takes a much broader view and offers scientific fact based causes rather than vague ""culture"" for disparity in the world."
1,Very disappointed!,"I am extremely disappointed by this book. I wonder how a renowned scholar could write such a bad book. The book contains some interesting (anecdotal) facts but totally inadequate to support the author's grand theory about why some countries are so rich and some are so poor. Reading this book is a torture (if not an insult to your intelligence) - it is full of anecdotal facts, unsupported theories, unbearable conclusions, and, to make it worse, full of Eurocentric prejudice. I think the comments made by Faruk Ekmekci (March 30, 2005) sums it up very well -- this book is a science (I am not sure I can call it a science) of obsolescence... I would recommend those who are interested in this subject read the books recommended in Frank Ekmekci's comments instead."
4,"Engaging writing style, great breadth of coverage, well balanced","Landes is a great writer, and this book sheds light on the many complex and interacting causes of national economic situations. Landes doesn't seem to have any particular axe to grind. He is not out to convert liberals to conservatism or vice versa. He is mainly interesting in presenting the historical facts, and interpreting them in as fair a manner as possible. Of course, historical interpretation is largely subjective, and some assertions are made without strong evidence or argument. Nevertheless, it is thought-provoking, brings a great deal of information together in a coherent way, and provides a very readable introduction to the complex question of why some countries are rich and others are poor."
5,dark & depressing,"Well this is a very rare look at Ivan. Here is a character I didn't know much about but learned a great deal from this ballet & the description that comes with it. The dancing is like nothing I have seen. this is a fabulous dvd & ballet lovers will not be dissapointed, recommend this highly."
4,do-it,"Mind provokeing book, with insight to behind the life and family history of one of the countrys greatest Malcolm X, A must do read.F."
5,Not for students only!,"This book has the most important information condensed from the big CRC handbook. I am an environmental engineer not a chemist. I've had mine for over 10 years and I've not needed to look at another chemistry handbook. Useful features include diagrams of hundreds of organic chemicals and a good dictionary of terms. If you need a chemistry handbook but are not a chemist, save yourself a lot of money and a little shelf space with this useful text."
5,Excellent Buy!,The first thing we noticed after plugging everything into the powercenter was that the tv no longer got static lines when we turned on the vacuum cleaner. We have a lot of power variations in our neighborhood and I like having the display to show was is actually coming in. I feel the equipment is now protected.
5,Great analog meter,This multimeter has nice easy to read scales. It's rubberized case makes it comfortable to handle. Convenient zeroing control. The stand-up feature is a nice touch also and the red-led continuity indicator and buzzer works like a charm.
5,"Good, low cost Filter","This filter was a good deal on Amazon and I used it to fill out an order, so I have not installed it yet. However, I have used Fram filters for many years on several cars. I always drive my cars close to 200,000 miles and haven't had an internal engine problem for over thirty years (not the same car). In my earlier years, I changed oil every 5000 miles, but now I wait until the reminder light comes on, which is environmentally friendly."
2,tired rehash of father-son bonding scenario,"I'm sorry but there was just nothing original or noteworthy about this film about a father and son who learn to 'bond' while taking their family's tree to be planted in Washington DC. Along the way the boy meets up with his online girl 'friend' who decides to tag along, without Dad knowing... and gruff Dad starts having feelings for the go-getter PR woman (and vice-versa) traveling behind them arranging for media attention. The plot was predictable from the get-go, and the acting was uninspired.... about as 'wooden' as the tree they are carrying in the back of the big rig. Mediocre Hallmark viewing here; certainly NOT worth buying the dvd in my humble opinion."
5,Not your regular Christmas Movie.,"Yes this is a Christmas movie but, it is much more. The plot has several twists and turns that just pop up during the movie. It has something for everyone."
4,good value,"It's small, and doesn't look like much, but in the year I've had this TV there have been no complaints. The picture quality is good, though the sound could be better (I hooked it up to my modest home theater system). It's extremely durable. I transport it all the time (I bring it with me on long trips so I can play my ps3). Overall, this is a good bedroom TV, and cheap. This is an entry level HDTV, and for the price there can be no complaints."
1,Frustrating tv!,After about 2 years the tv audio would clip out. Then later the picture wouldn't show unless we warmed up the tv for about 5 minutes. When you first turn it on it you have to wait and turn it on and off for a while to finally get a picture. Won't buy another Polaroid tv as far as I can see.
2,Hard to digest,"I enjoy Dr. Mercola's newsletters, but this book was a bit disappointing. I thought it would let me know what to eat,etc. but I have to figure that out for myself by taking a quick quiz. Many of the questions were hard to answer,and every time I took the test, what kind of foods I should eat changed. (whether I should be on a protein, carbohydrate, or combination diet) Then he stated you really needed to take a more extensive online test to REALLY tell--of course it was costly. As I sayed before, it was disappointing. Glad I didn't spend very much on the book."
1,"Rehash of ""No Grain""","If you're only going to add in a couple pages more information to an existing book, release it as a new edition, not an entirely new book."
3,"Lone dissenter here, but wasn't that impressed.","This book certainly wasn't terrible or a waste of time to read but after all the 5 star reviews I guess I was expecting something better. The characters were basically likable, their romance worked well, I liked the medieval setting, but I didn't find the paranormal elements all that well integrated and I think this book would have worked better as a straight historical romance because the historical background was I think the best part of the story. This book was a pleasant enough read but not really a must-read."
3,"Not bad, but not a must-read.","atlantis_girl is no longer the only dissenter here. I agree with her that the paranormal hints just don't work in the story. The author must refer to Tamlyn as ""witchy"" a hundred times. There are paranormal hints there, but it never comes to a true head, so the references are just distracting. The power of Scotland can be used with being overused (or misused).I think the thing that bothered me most was the way Julian treats Tamlyn. I understand that ""in those days"" a man WAS the only power, and a woman was just a piece of property. However, that's not what I want in a romance novel. Julian is pigheaded and arrogant, just rude. It taints even the sexy parts.I'm new-ish to the romance genre. This is not an author I'll be reading more from. I'm just too worried all her male leads are like this."
5,A Hidden Gem,I was introduced to the words and music of Paul Brady over twenty years ago when this album came out and was completely bowled over by it. I can't believer he never caught on in the US. I was hooked then and remain so. Melodies and lyrics remain poignant and relevent today. Worth a listen. This is my favorite of Paul Brady's albums.
3,my opinion,can yall please put this on dvd 4 me. i just want this show on dvd lookin clear knowing i spend my money right thank amazon.
2,I wanted to love this but...,"I wanted to love this because of the pricing and my satisfaction with 3M's 1-inch foam squares. But... these are not the same dense foam. This is a much lighter, squishable foam. I use these for paper crafting (cards, etc.) to add dimension and you can hardly tell they are ""popped up"" at all. Sadly disappointed... going back to cutting 1"" squares into fours..."
4,Nice introduction,"A pleasant introduction to the subject, easy to read, covers many topics but won't get into too much depth. The author adds a touch of humour to some of the exercises, which is nice, and at the end you'll find answers to many of them."
2,not so believable,"This was a very silly book. I picked it up hoping for something a little more realistic. Instead of first-person accounts or facts, it was full of stories she had created using some of these things. The dialogue was contrived and often the stories didn't focus on real hauntings, but her made-up ones. Pretty much a big disappointment."
4,Nancy doing her thing!,"This is a really good read at night. Nancy has written some really good books in her time, this one included. She is also a Carolina girl at heart!"
1,Awkward,"This wok is heavy and unbalanced - it can tip while on the element.The long handle is thick and uncomfortable, and its solid weight is probably what unbalances the wok. Lifting it up is difficult with one hand and trying to shift the food to a plate is a dangerous task.The flat bottom isn't wide enough to really be stable or to capture enough heat for the high temperature required for stir-frying. If I wanted to sauté, I'd have gotten a sauté pan.The lid is also heavy and difficult to put anywhere. You need lots of counter space.As well, this wok just isn't large enough for stir-frying for more than two people."
1,How do you use this to teach Spanish?,"I borrowed this set from the library. After reading through the introduction and then listening to a couple of the tracks on the CD, I have no idea how you're supposed to use this to teach Spanish. If there was a picture for each phrase, then maybe I could understand, but there's not. Between high school and college, I took five years of Spanish, so my non-understanding is not from not knowing any Spanish. I'm going to keep looking."
4,Book and CD,"The book is good, it provides basic conversational Spanish. I expected the CD to be different, it is good in the sense that a child that already knows how to read can read the dialog in the book as the CD plays, but for my younger daughters that don't know how to read yet, the CD is not very helpful."
3,Great CD and Book,My kids sing the songs on the DVDs as they are quite catchy. Not bad at all to teach little one another language.
2,maybe my girl is too young...,My daughter 2 year old listened to other spanish cds and likes her spanish dvd but she didn't like this cd at all.
2,Not what I expected,"The ""songs"" are not really songs. It is more like a book on tape. The students can't sing along. It would be nice to have to read to a child one-on-one, but not for group singing and playing."
5,Excellent resource for families,"The authors take listeners through a day's activities in Spanish. With their two very distinct accents (Spain and Argentina), Marcela and Ana entertain children through mealtimes, playtime, and bedtime. They explore language within the context of real-life activities.As a preschool Spanish instructor, I find this text very useful and often recommend it to parents as an excellent resource. It's great for the car, and appeals to little princesses, pirates, tigers, and children with all kinds of creative energy and linguistic talent. Enjoy!"
4,Loved It!,"I thoroughly enjoyed the game. If you just wander through the house, nothing is going to happen. Look at everything! The only problem I had, was a little lag when going through doors. I even got a little spooked. Fortunately, I don't have a basement. The Last Visit was too short, but pretty cool as well."
3,pretty fun,Game was pretty fun ...the usualy point and click type game. It got a little spooky playing alone in the dark but then again im 24 and still sleep with a night light lol. Overall it was an ok game.
1,disappointing,"Kenwood is a great drummer and I love him with Maceo.This video, however, is quite bad. Both the video and sound quality are low. It looks and sounds as if you recorded yourself in a garage. He plays on his own with no track or anything. There is no usual feet angles so you can't see what his legs are doing. There is little or no explanation on what's going on. A very low budget video. Not very recommended."
5,The Priests,"Love the DVD! If you are a fan of The Priests, you will love watching this DVD. I'm glad I purchased it."
3,Good Bag,"I'm happy with the bag. For the price, it's more than I expected. The only part of the bag that I'm not happy with is that it's velcro-only to close up the bag, which makes it not very secure, and the strap is thin and uncomfortable."
5,Good Product,"Bought this for a friend, she is very happy with it. Its been a while and its still going strong. It holds a lot of stuff as well."
2,Don't buy this bag,The organizing section shown in the picture does not exist. There's no pen or pocket holders under the flap.
2,teacher aide,"This bag is ok, not exactly as I would have liked. It is lacking a zipper that would help keep your things in it. You get what you pay for."
2,messenger bag,"At first sight, this bag seems ideal. However, after actually using it for a few days I discovered that for my needs, it's actually uncomfortable to use. The flap closes tight with the velcro tape and it becomes an adventure to open it and retrieve or pack in an item inside while it still hangs from your shoulder, it is very soft, so it molds to your body, making things worse. Yes the flap is very safe, but you pay a price for it."
3,My favorite store ice cream but not my favorite book,"There is really only one thing that I don't like about this book but it is a pretty big one for me. They don't have a sweet cream base that uses eggs that are cooked (you need to use one of the bases to make each recipie). I am not a huge fan of bases without eggs (like their #2 base which is cream, half and half and sugar) since they don't freeze well and really should be eaten right away. I would only recommend this book if you already have a base that you have had success with that has eggs that are cooked (which produces a much creamier ice cream than the non egg version)."
4,Lots of great flavors,Just what I was looking for. A great book with lots of different flavors of ice cream. Also gives great advice on how to make fruit flavored ice creams. Best part is the recipes are quick with no cooking required for a great tasting ice cream.
4,Perfect Ice Cream,"I bought this along with a KitchenAid Ice Cream maker attachment, and I'm glad I did. The recipies are clearly written and easy to follow, and offer alternatives if you have issues with certain ingredients. It takes a little while to realize that there really aren't that many recipies in the book, but almost all of them are easily modified or adapted, something the authors frequently encourage.Recommended."
5,Great Ice-Cream,I bought this recipe book as a companion for my daughter's Christmas gift of a ice cream maker. We have made anything from plain chocolate to mocha almond to lemon sorbet. Everything has turned out great...our favorite being the vanilla with cookie dough that we made last night. My daughter is only 11 years old and she has been able to follow the directions and make the recipes on her own.
3,Raw eggs?,"Good book, lots of recipes. All of the recipes in this book use a sweet cream base. There are 3 recipes for the base and two of them use raw eggs and the third is only recommended (by the aurthors) if you can't make one of the other two.So, if you have young children or have a compormised immune system, you may want to try another book that uses recipes with cooked eggs. The Perfect Scoop has some really nice recipes and they cook their eggs."
4,Kind of strange...like a comic book with recipes?,"I couldn't wait for this book to arrive in the mail. It has lots of ice cream recipes and some introductory background information about ice cream info and making at the beginning which is great. What is peculiar about this book is the art work inside. They have chosen to use what I guess looks like a psychedelic motif in the back ground art om most pages.I expected a normal recipe book, you know, with titles and lists of things and instructions in there, and they are, but this book winds up looking much like a children's book. The pages have this odd art work, if you can call it that; when my wife opened it she immediately asked me where I got this children's book, said that her nice would like one.I am sure the recipes are just fine, others recommend this book and that was my basis for buying it, guess its about what you'd expect from a couple of old timers."
2,Interesting But Poor,"If one likes comic books, then the graphics and sub plot will be of interest. However, if one is interested in making ice cream, then this is NOT the book for you.Sure, it will provide an idea of the type of ingredients used in a variety of home made ice creams. However, all of the recipes appear to use whole eggs in place of other books that put emphasis on only using the yolk. The other scary part is that the mixes with raw eggs are not cooked. With no cooking, the possibility of Salmonella could occur.A much better book is ""The Perfect Scoop"" at 256 pages vs the 128 for Ben & Jerry's. Plus the cost of the ""The Perfect Scoop"" is about a dollar more making for a best buy rating. i.e. prices may varyIf a person is even more serious about making home made ice cream, then take a look at ""Ice Creams, Sorbets & Gelati - The Definitive Guide"" by Robin Weir."
5,EXCELLENT,"THIS BOOK WAS SO HELPFUL AND VERY DETAILED IN EXPLAINING HOW TO ACHIEVE THE MOST CREAMIEST ICE CREAM. IT WAS EXCELLENT, AWESOME, EASY, AND I LOVE IT. THIS ICE CREAM BOOK CONTAINS MANY FLAVORS THAT YOU DON'T USUALLY FIND IN STORES, AND I THINK THAT IS A GREAT THING! SOME RECIPES CONTAIN VERY SMALL QUANTITIES OF INGREDIENTS, BUT...HAVE A GIANT TASTE!! WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE WHO PURCHASES AN ICE CREAM MAKER."
3,Could be better...,The book could have better recipes once you get to know better books this one is passed on to the shelf's archive... Coul have an harcover and better layout...
5,WOW! A GREAT BOOK!!!,This book is awesome and well worth the money! YUM!! Buy one for yourself and your friends.
1,EGGS COULD BE A PROBLEM,THEY USE EGGS BUT DONT HEAT THEM WITH THE CREAM AND MILK TO OVER 170 DEGREES TO KILL ANY BACTERIA. THIS WORRIES ME AS OTHER RECIPES HEAT THE MIXTURE AND VERY FAMILAR WITH ICE CREAM FACTORY MIX WAS PASTEURIZED BEFORE FREEZING
3,Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream Book,"Good, basic, recipe book. I like that it gives the beginner a good foundation for marking ice cream. It's a step up from the book that comes with the ice cream makers."
2,Ben & Jerry's receipe book,The information in the book was for small batch ice cream. It requires to much improvision to apply to 4 & 6 quart ice cream makers. I was somewhat disapointed in the content.
4,Yum!,"This is a great book for the history of Ben and Jerry and of Ben and Jerry's ice cream business. The recipes that I have used so far are great, but I expected more recipes. I can't wait till spring and summer to use the fresh fruit in the ice cream. It is a great book for beginning ice cream makers, which I definitely am!"
4,Fun to read,"was fun to read, made excellent ice cream with it, everyone loves it and my kids keep pulling it out and letting their friends choose flavors. Fantastic coffee ice cream"
5,As Funny to read as it is Yummy to eat!,"Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield not only share their best recipes in this book. With dozens of delicious dessert instructions, that alone would have been enough. They also use this book to tell the Ben & Jerry's story, and it's a good story, told with a lot of wit and humor and illustrated in their familiar style. My family had as much fun laughing over the anecdotes filling this book as we did eating the ice cream we made."
2,Purchased as a gift,but I was not impressed with the packaging nor the quality of the box. I can't speak for the stuff on the inside since I didn't use it myself.
5,They don't come much better than this!,"All of the aviation books from this publisher are phenomenal, and are bargains even at the price offered. I highly recommend them to all miliary aviation enthusiasts."
4,"As always, a joy to read","It saddens me that Laurie McBain's books are no longer in print. I HAVE THEM ALL, but I'm always checking to see if there is another I've missed. The characters in ""When The Splendor Falls"", touch your heart, make you laugh, make you cry. Leigh and Neil are ""soul mates"", that will make you believe in the endurance of love. With the exception of the ""Moonstruck Madness"" Series, this was my favorite!!!"
5,Interesting slice of life portrait of a compelling actor,"Weiser's carefully crafted portrait reveals as much about one actor's method of preparing for a challenging role as it does about the soul of a major motion picture production. Weiser, an insider himself, is a very capable craftsman. His use of the language creates such vivid mental pictures that I was not conscious of reading at all. This is a fast, and quite fun read. I discovered an unexpected bonus as the author shares with us a charming glimpse of my favourite young actress, Gwyneth Paltrow. Buy it!"
5,Afflicted,"I met Mel in L.A. in October and talked to him about his book. As promised, I told him that I would read it when I got back home. As an actor, I was most interested in the techniques and preparation used by Nolte. I am amazed at the incredible amount of work he puts into his role research. He is a true inspiration! Mel, email me when you get a chance."
5,The Great Escape,"This book provides unique insights into some of the most important scientific and artistic accomplishments in the Western world from the 1930s to the present. kati Marton offers key information about the men who did so much to change our world, information new to me even though I thought I knew a great deal about each of the emigres portrayed here. She recreates brilliantly the world of ""Mitteleurope,"" now lost forever. If this book doesn't help you understand and appreciate genius, nothing will!"
5,supreme bel canto,"Eventhough Carreras does not sound great right now, this recording is a great portrait of the outstanding sound his voice had when he was younger. The supreme beauty of his voice was incredible. ""Una furtiva lagrima"" brings tears to my eyes and I am sure that it also brings tears to the eyes of many other fans. Thanks Mr. Carreras for making a tradition much more beautiful."
4,Divine sounds,"This is great music for relaxation and meditation or to recharge your psychic batteries. It's a compilation with similar-sounding tracks drawn from a wide variety of his albums, like Radiance, Inner Peace, Ancient Echoes and Spectrum Suite so it all hangs together nicely. There's lots of ethereal choirs and spacey melodies. My favorite by far is the uplifting, even rousing, Pachelbel's Canon and the delicate Eternally. Ideal for using as a soundtrack to the practices of holistic healing or just to destress and reclaim your inner piece."
5,So much joy and fun,I'm not quite sure how anyone can give the Brady Bunch a 1 star rating like the one reviewer but so be it.This is one of the campiest sitcoms ever but isn't that it's special quality? I mean how can you not love astroturf for lawn and windows without glass?The Brady home was about the coolest home ever and if I were a millionaire I'd build one just like it and be stuck in the 70's.This is Americana personified and will be known forever.I can't wait until every season is on DVD and we'll have our eternal 70's forever.
4,Very useful,This is one of the most useful reference books for those in nursing who are going to focus in psychiatric nursing. This is a great book but it can get wordy at times.
1,EuroPro Shark G1475,"I purchased this item from Target and was sold by the Auto Shut Off feature as well as the Anti-Calc and Anti-Drip statements on the box.Every time I have used the iron it SHUTS OFF while I am ironing; yes, while the iron is in motion! Then, as it is cooling down, it spews water from the sole plate all over the article I am ironing. It's a real mess.Even though I am diligent about emptying all the water when I am finished ironing, calcium deposits do form and white residue sprays out with the steam, which shows up on dark fabric I am ironing.All in all, I am very disatisfied with this product."
1,90 minutes has a cost...,"Understanding the basics of Kierkegaard in 90 minutes sounds promising. However, it's quite often that such exciting promises fall short. This good is a great example of this. Right now I am taking a graduate level Kierkegaard class. Having no background in Kierkegaard going into this class, I figured that this short book might help me get a general overview of Kierkegaard before I was thrown into such a hard class.This book gave some good biographical information about Kierkegaard's early life. But other than that this book was not very helpful at all. The author seems unwilling to accept that Kierkegaard was a Christian and therefore presents all of Kierkegaard's religious work as worthless. He lets his personal views get in the way his presentation of the real Kierkegaard. This is ridiculous... On top of that, the author only focuses on a couple of works - and even though he doesn't represent well.90 minutes has a cost..."
2,A waste of time and money,"If you are considering purchasing this thing to make copies of commercially made VHS tapes to DVD, don't waste your time or your money because it is essentially useless for that purpose, the resulting copies are horrible, grainy, and with jittery lines in the picture, etc. Some people say this thing will remove the Macrovision protection which is responsible for the wavy lines and such, but forget it, it will not, at least not to any kind of acceptable degree. As far as I know it is legal to make a backup copy of original tapes that you own, for your own personal use under the ""fair use"" provision, just as you can make an archival copy of computer software, as long as it is for your own use, and not to sell etc. The only reason I gave this thing 2 stars is that it might prove useful for transferring home videos to DVD although I have not tried that yet."
4,moscow music peace festival,"this was an album put together by all the bands who were kicking drugs and/or alcohol in 1989.there is a list of every musician who ever died from drugs or alcohol in the notes.it is extremely long.the money from the concert and album went to the make a difference foundation to combat substance abuse.the bands were asked to do thier favorite song by one of the dead people from the list.lets see,since i dont see a list here,i will have to resort to memory..............theres the scorpions,skid row,motley crue,ozzy osbourne,gorky park and many many more."
4,worthwhile read,"This book is specifically about building in Mexico. It does inform the reader at the same time, of many cultural issues and how to go accomplishing other goals accomplished in Mexico. I thought it was well written and entertaining both. We have purchased some books on the ""ex-pat"" subject that were totally off the wall and seemed like more personal venting of political views than anything else. ""Gringos in Paradise"" kept to the subject."
5,interlacing examples for the artist,"Only book on islamic art I know of that gives detailed examples of interlacing with construction details, as well as demonstrating the result. Text is minimal. Large plates showing how to construct with ruler and compass are cool, as are some colored examples, but the information on square roots is confusing for the math challenged.So the book fulfills a certain niche, some pattern construction details, no symmetry group info. but does have hard to find interlacing examples for the artist."
5,I am so happy these books are back in print!,"I loved these Three Investigator books as a child, and am so glad they are back in print. They are all wonderful (Arthur is the best author of the series) and I will buy these great mysteries for my children. My only regret is that I did not save my originals, many of which had the trio's original sponsor, Alfred Hitchcock, in the novels and on the title. I have only one of those left. By the way, I think The Secret of Terror Castle is the best of the many mysteries."
4,Great Trouble Light,This product lives up to it's claim. Built rugged as anything. Should last a very long time. Heavy duty. Would buy another one.
5,Good price,This is a better price than on the Epson site. I ordered two and got the free shipping. Only buy Epson ink--it doesn't pay to get a third party brand--they can screw up your printer
5,Black ink cartridges arrived immediately,Arrived immediately and in good shape. Only problem was Amazon.com divided order for 3 different color cartridges up and sent it to 3 different vendors. One vendor still hasn't got me the correct cartridges yet.
1,Not as advertised,These cartridges were listed as working with my Epson Photo RX595 but the printer did not recognize them. Waste of time and money.
2,Only oatmeal- no granola.,"This product is only sweetened oatmeal with varying amounts of blueberries, but there is absolutely NO GRANOLA in any of the the 4 boxes I've eaten so far. So when the box says Granola, read oatmeal and six dried blueberries. It tastes fine for what it is, just know that it is not granola (like the box says it is)."
3,Easy to follow.,"I was pleased with with this book. At the end of each chapter, a demonstration problem is provided with step by step instructions. Also available are template spreadsheet at the Southwestern website which are very helpful in understanding some end of chapter exercises."
4,Great beginner reference!!,"Dr.Saibil does a wonderful job writing to us--the general public. There are no huge scientific words. If unfamiliar words must be used, he is very careful to define them for the reader. For new sufferers, this is the starter reference for you!!"
2,Remanufactured is the key word.,The display died shortly after the warranty expired the display went out. It continued to work properly otherwise. The cost to repair the display was not justified.
2,Not close to the potential,"Popper could have done so much more with this CD. Did not live up to my expectations at all. Don't waste your money on this one, buy BT Travelers instead."
1,i can't believe anyone considers this 'music',"'miserable bastard' is the most adolescently conceived piece of trash i've ever heard - i can't believe the masses consume such irrelevant garbage - the song is void of any kind of development, any iterations or struggle - no palimpsets for john popper! god, this is awful. wretched in concept and worse in execution."
3,SLOWER THAN THE BLUES TRAVLER ALBUMS BUT STILL GOOD,THE ALBUM IS GOOD BUT POPPER IS TEN TIMES BETTER LIVE. I SAW HIM ON SEPT 13 IN BURLINGTON VERMONT AND THE SHOW WAS AMAZING. hE CAPPED IT OFF WITH A TRIBUTE TO HIS BASSIST BY SINGING SWEET PAIN. UNBELIEVABLE
3,Popper Expanding on His Artistic Abilities,"This album is, let's say different. Don't let people fool you, it takes a while to get used to this cd. Popper Has a few great songs on here but nothing that jumps out at you like in previous BT albums. I am afraid this won't be a very successful album"
2,san ten no kata,"i found it very hard to go from text book to physical application, i already train inShotokan so kata is not new"
3,Aiken does well in with serious novel.,"""Voices in an Empty House"" was a new direction from Joan Aiken. In it, Thomas Cook, a publisher with arthitis and frequent amnesia due to the pain meds tries to find his stepson, Gabriel Baird, the son of August ""Gus"" Baird, now-deceased genius and Nobel winner. Gabriel is hiding somewhere in New York City, and Thomas tries to find him so that Gabriel can have a life-saving heart operation. Also on the trail is Gabriel's mother, the extremely self-centered Bella and her brother Bo, who is dark, moody and may know more than he lets on. The book moves through flashbacks to the past, where Thomas has a dark secret, and the present as the climax goes to Staten Island and an old decrepit mill, where danger is closer than any realizes."
4,Well worth the money,"To love with the intensity of Domingo's Nessun Dorma! - Perhaps once in a lifetime - if we're so lucky, or when lost, so desolate. Wonderful aria's of love. My only complaint, some of the recordings (to my ear anyway) are somewhat muddy, although the voices of the lead performers (all great) are well miked. Well worth the money."
2,minor problems,"The ""egg"" opens envelopes well enough - the problem is that instead of slitting the envelopes on the top edge, it slits them about 1/8th of an inch _below_ the top edge. Which means that if a letter inside the envelope happens to be up that high, the letter can also be slit during the process of opening the letter. It has happened to me already (although I suspect it would probably be a relatively rare occurence).One other note: the surface of the ""egg"" is much more shiny than you might think from looking at the photo illustrating the product on Amazon. In the photo, it appears to have a slightly matte effect. In reality, it is a very shiny, mirror-like, chrome surface."
2,Wonderful Watch but.......,"This watch is GREAT! I took it to a jewelry store and had the band adjusted to fit and it hasn't lost a minute since then. I checked out some other reviews and websites about this brand and it seems to be a very reliable brand though relatively unknown. After having this watch for about six months, the movement started making an awful grinding noise. I sent it back and they polished it (outside) and replaced a gasket. The movement still had the same noise. I sent it back again and they replaced the movement. I got it back on 7/9/2010, eight months to the day after buying it and it ran for three hours and after that would not wind up or run. I would not recommend this brand at all."
2,Crackers are overcooked.,"This is my third purchase of these crackers and I was surprised to see that the first package had brown edges, the second package in case was more overcooked, and the third package, the crackers are brown on top. Very disappointing and has burned taste."
3,Solid but dated,"The Hosta Book is full of good basic information, but skip it if you want to know about newer cultivars and enjoy lots of pretty pictures. It has plenty of detail about the care and classification of hostas. It looks (and reads) like something out of the 1950's or 60's."
3,Not for the more advanced,The coverage text was broad based and general. Didn't devel into the more complicated issues I was looking for go. But it would be great for a beginner hosta fan.
3,Great product but not as described..,"This sport shield arrived very fast, looked great but has the wrong size clamps. According to the description, my 1992 GSX1100G was listed as a bike that it would fit using the universal mounting kit. My bike has stock 1"" bars and the kit came with 7/8"" clamps. I contacted the seller, to arrange a swap, but they said I had to buy a $20 1"" clamp kit. Check your bars to make sure yours are 7/8"" so it will work with the sellers ""universal"" 7/8"" clamps. Funny thing, my bike is the exact one shown in the product picture! LOL"
5,Works Great and Arrived Fast,I shopped around and picked this windshield. Very happy so far. Installation was easy and works great. I use my bike everyday for commuting.
4,its a bulb,"it works as it should, night light hasnt burnt out yet, im happy with the product, seems like a reasonable price"
2,Buy the straight stuff instead,"I first heard Jonathan and Darlene (or Jo and Paul) in the early 1970s. My first take was: these people are brilliant! My second take: after five minutes, they are also close to unlistenable. For anyone with a decent ear, it quickly becomes painful hearing Jo barely missing the notes and Weston messing up the tempo. I guess it might be fun to play ONCE at a party, but I think a much better investment would be to buy any of the Jo Stafford reissues (there are excellent and cheap boxed sets available) and marvel at her superb musicianship. Listen to Stafford and you'll understand what being really ""on pitch"" is all about."
2,"Bad ""Bad Music""","This record has its hilarious moments, but it duly becomes obvious that Jonathan and Darlene Edwards actually are talented musicians who are pretending to suck.Here, I think, is why it bothered me:Jenkins's struggles are funny because they are real. I'm sure that when the Edwardses are singing for real, they sound good. Once I figured out that the Edwardses were not bad singers but people making fun of bad singers, the joke was no longer funny. As a listener, I felt as if I were helping the Edwardses gang up on the Florence Foster Jenkinses of the world."
5,A touching yet humorous look one's Cuban-American roots.,This book made me come to terms with what being a Cuban born American means to me. Perez Firmat shares his own personal and sometimes painful experiences with the readers. In doing so he made it easier to define and understand my own experience as a Cuban-American who loves the United States yet has a yearning to gain a deeper understanding of his own Cuban roots.
5,Mr. freeze alarm clock,Received on time in a well packaged box. I would only suggest since I live in AZ that when sending put a warning on pacjage to not leave in extreme heat. It was 110 degrees outside and could have been damaged.
3,Disappointing after Wiggle Time,"We received Wiggle Time as a gift, we'd never seen the Wiggles before, and my daughter loves it! So I wanted to get her another dvd to give the other a little rest. She watches it but it doesn't have the fun dances that Wiggle Time has. It is so sweet to see her get excited and learn the dance moves, & that isn't happening with this particular dvd. And the Spanish songs are pretty bad. I preferred the more ""boring"" sets and the little kids dancing to this jazzed up stuff with adult dancers."
3,"Cute, but has some issues...","My daughter got the entire Bratz Kidz line for her 8th birthday. The dolls are very cute and she loves them. However, they have thick legs that are hard to get into the clothes (pants) and their hands are hard to fit in the long sleeve shirts. Translation: I have had to do a lot of the dressing...UGH!! The packaging is unbelievable! I spent over 1.5 hours getting everything out of their packages. I don't think I have ever seen so many rubber bands, twist ties and threads all individually blister packed. It took an exacto knife and some very sharp scissors to get the job done and I ended up accidentally cutting a hole in one of the little outfits. I think they could survive a nuclear attack! Give us parents and our landfills a break MGA!"
5,Fun read!,"Daisy Cox, ex-beauty queen is about to be an ex-bride...before the wedding even takes place. She's running away with the help of Rick Shane. But instead of just a hero...she finds someone to love. Unfortunately, Rick says he doesn't love her back. So Daisy's going back to her ex-groom, unless Rick finds the strength to confront his past and allow himself to love again.Crystal Green crafts a fun read that will warm your heart on a cold winter evening!"
4,Funny female amateur sleuth,"Brenda Midnight is a Greenwich Village hatmaker who gets robbed of a piece of beaded lace and then finds her best friend, who gave her the lace to work on, killed. From there on it's a comic mystery. The information about the Seventh Avenue and Greenwich Village fashion scene was interesting. There's a wonderful snooty law firm that presents a facade of upmarket efficiency but where nobody really knows what they're doing. (She fakes her way into a job there and pretends to be operating a computer). I was reminded of Sparkle Hayter by the downtown Manhatten milieu, and, to be honest, by the tendency to substitute eccentricity for characterization. (""Slaves of New York"" had another Greenwich Village hatmaker).The plot is fantastic but tight and logically coherent.I enjoyed this and will be looking for more. The missing star is only because Janet Evanovich and Sue Grafton write within this same category and something has to be reserved for them."
2,Dissapointed,"I made my first recipe from this book. Fresh Tuna and Zucchini Pasta Sauce. It called for quick sauteeing the tuna in hot olive oil, removing the tuna and then adding 1/4 cup of wine. When I did exactly that, the splattering all over the range, exhaust, floor was unbelievable. Surely the author or Susan Friedland the editor should have known better than to recommend this procedure.I am now afraid to try anything else."
1,Dress then mess,Dress pieces are hard to put on for 4 year old. Pieces are all over the place. Car doesn't fit both people easily. Trunk doesn't hold all pieces. Drive by this Covertible!!!
1,20 minutes was enough.,"Great book if you're interested in Kant's severe bouts of constipation in his later life..At the very worst, Strathern actually tries to discourage you from reading Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, exclaiming that it's over 800 pages then proceeding to quote a small portion to demonstrate how impenetrable the text is.He explains very little of Kant's thought but is very successful in telling more than I ever needed to know about Kant's non-eventful personal life.The philosophical equivalent of an E! True Hollywood Story."
3,"Gives a feel for Kant's life and mission, that's about it.","After reading this, I came away with a definite feeling for Kant's life, homeplace, and mission. I also had a feel for Kant's rather unusual personality and interests in life. However, in regards to Kant's actual ideas and philosophy, I was still quite unclear as to the real ""meat"" behind what thousands of other philosophy books have been written about. The only really clear concept was the ""categorical imperative"", and as alluded to by other reviewers, even this was not entirely correct. Hence I can't say this book delivers essentially on what Kant was about."
3,Progressive potential,"3 1/2Masque contains just enough schlock rock to keep it from brimming over with brilliance, but any lingering cheesiness factor is almost always overridden with complex engagement."
4,removing fleas from my dog one month use.,"It works pretty good. The fleas do get electrocufied, sometimes, they just get stunned, or just plainly caught. I use a small dish with soap to drop them from the comb. You do need to use the small plastic comb to remove the fleas that gets stuck between the comb teeth otherwise the electric zapping doesn't work any further. The downfall is that the zapper is cheaply built and I already had to put scotch tape to keep the battery from being disconnected from the unit. Otherwise I would say it works better than a regular flea comb."
3,"Good idea, poor implementation.","How this comb is supposed to work:The comb is two rows of tiny electrodes. When a flea gets between the rows a small voltage electrocutes it. The device makes a high-pitched sound that varies when the comb comes in contact with fur, fleas or fingers.Sounds simple, but in practice it doesn't work well.For one thing, the small voltage is detectable, though not harmful. Your pet is going to HATE you for zapping him.Also, there are plastic guides along the ends to try to keep the electrodes off your pet's sensitive flesh. Unfortunately, unless your pet has a thick or curly coat the guides actually hold the comb off the fur.The only plus to this device is that you can play it like a theramin."
2,I really tried to make it work,"It is a wonderful idea, but this model does not work. I tried it on 2 dogs and 7 cats all with different hair lengths. I got two fleas who were just stunned. I really really wanted it to work but it just didn't. Even when I touched the tines I felt nothing, not even a tingle. SAD"
3,its ok,i have the same experiences as the last guy. it works just ok and i have to put tape on the battery cover.
1,waste...,"Refused to work with my Australian shepherds hair. Was hoping tip at least use it as a basic comb, but no nothing. Waste of my money."
2,Kinda cheezy and R&B meets Africa,"Well, I listened to the track samples on Amazon.com and decided I wanted this CD. But I just got it for x-mas and decided that it's super cheezy. It's Afro pop meets disco meets R&B. That's not my thing. Some of the tracks are interesting but mostly I would be kind of embarrassed to share this music with anyone I know because I don't think it's very good."
5,BEST BOOK EVER!!!,"THIS BOOK IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST BOOK EVER!! ARLEN COHN WILL BE THE NEXT DR. SUESS!! THE PICTURES ARE WONDERFUL! IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? GO AHEAD, YOU'LL LOVE IT! :o)"
5,Christians and non-Christians must read,This book truley explaines where women fit in in the church.
4,It was real and intense!,I am not an avid book reader but I did stick with this one. Just trying to see more of my past it helped to open many of those areas that are still foggy. I would suggest all Veterans that were in Vietnam read this one. Airborne
1,"Print-type is way, way too small!","The book is way too small in size and therefore the print-type in this particular paperback is way, way too small! My eyesight is quite good howevcer I had to strain just to try to read a page ot two. I ended up not reading it because of this because it was just too difficult to read the small type. I would not recommend this particular paperback but would suggest the hardcover or another perhaps another publishing companies version."
1,Where is it,"I would LOVE to review this purchase however I have not received it yet. Every other Amazon.com purchase I have made has been fab, I hope this one shows up soon.Cynthia"
1,Item not yet received,I ordered this item more than two months ago and have still not received an issue.
5,love YJ but not the auto renewal,The subscription was a gift for a friend. I tried to stop the auto-renewal for 2013 year but the response indicated the current subscription would stop being delivered even though there were two more issues to come.I would prefer to make the decision to renew a gift or not. The options should be clearer to the user.
4,Almost Perfect,"I love every feature in this magazine except for one..... The recipes need a lot of work. Most issues that come out I try the recipes but I've only made a few that actually taste good. Other than that, I love this magazine. Great yoga poses, health info and emotional/spiritual (without any particular denomination) well being articles."
5,Captivating!,This CD is enjoyable for kids and grown-ups too. The songs have a playful sense of humor that appeals to all.
3,THE War With Grandpa,I think it was good because the book shows not to fight against your kin. I think you should read it because it's funny and it teaches you why not to fight against your kin.I liked the part that grandpa put's Peter's books in thesuitcases.Well that's it.I can't tell you more or it will ruinthe story.
4,The War With Grandpa,Grandpa Jack is moving with Peter's family.Grandpa Jack is having Peter's room.Peter is very mad and his friend said to go to war with Grandpa Jack.Peter had 3attacks.I iove the book.The funniest attack was the last one.Why dont you buy his book?
2,A little dull,"I had to read this for library class. It was alright. It wasn't as bad as Johnny Tremain, but it was no classic either. It could have been a better novel if the author put in more characters and made a more complex plot."
4,The War With Grandpa,Tammy. You should read this book! We just finished this book.It's amazing!This book is about a boy named Peter Stokes and his grandpa Jack.They get into a fight. In other words Peter calls it psycholgical warfare!You should read this book to find out what happens.
4,The War With Grandpa,"My Name is Ariel.I liked this book because Peter, and Grandpa keept playing tricks on each other. I also liked the book because Peter's parent'sdidn't know about the war. My favorite part of the book was when peter took Grandpa's false teeth, it was funny. My second favorite part was when Grandpa played all of those tricks on him like when all of his books were in suitcases. that made him so late he forgot something of his. I can't tell you the rest but I have to say it was a really funny book."
3,I thought the book was an OK book to do a unit in school on,This is a pretty good book with some funny parts as it is written in report format.I.E. the kid is writing the story as a report for his teacher.
5,The War With Grandpa,The War With Grandpa is a great book because it taught me that life is not always fair.It also taught me that life is real hard.I mean if you are smart and intelligent it probably wouldn't be so hard.For me some parts were hard to understand it.War With Grandpa is also a great book because it is funny.
5,The War With Grandpa,I liked this book because it was funny and it was really really cool! The book is about a fith grader Peter that goes to war to get his room back from his Grandpa. The best part that I like is when Peter does something to Grandpa`s teeth. My other best part is when Grandpa does 9 sneaky tricks to Peter. That`s as much as I can tell you because I don`t want to spoil the story.
4,Cipriano's Review,"I like this book because Peter and his Grandpa have a war so he could get his room back. This reminded me of my Grandfather in Mexico and when my grandfather came to visit. So, I could relate to Peter quite a bit.Review by Cipriano"
5,The War With Grandpa,I liked this book becuase it was funny. What the book is about is when Peter goes to war with Grandpa. Grandpa stole Peter's room. Grandpa played a trick on Peter. Peter got him back buy another trick. Read t
4,The War With Grandpa,Alex.My favorite part is when Jeney told Peter that Grandpa was moving in to their house because they think about everything hes going to do and still don't know where hes going to sleep or wonder what it is going to be like.My least favorite part is when Jeney almost finds out because the action will stop and they will both get in trouble.
1,Horrible...still pictures and limited-to-no narration,"Simply horrible. The instructor doesn't bother to instruct. Mostof the DVD looks like a SLIDE show of still pictures and text,limited ""movie"" (visual or audio instruction)This is by far the worst DVD of any kind I had the misfortune to own.I can't believe the high reviews other people gave this..."
5,A musical and dramatic masterpiece,"The instrumental interludes have become symphonic staples. The chorus parts are unsurpassed for their dramatic impact. This was one of John Vickers' signature roles, and he was one of the greatest dramatic tenors of his time. It is not background music. It is a powerful experience."
1,The mp3 album has little gaps between tracks which disrupt enjoyment of this recording. AMAZON TAKE NOTE,"Amazon ruins many of the best recordings it has available as MP3s by allowing there to be fading or gaps between tracks, which destroys operas and symphonies. Do not download this here."
4,Thumbs up,"I bought this at WMart and it was the only one that they had so the decision was made for me. I bought it to replace the thermo on my Old New Braunfels Okie Joe smoker that was pegged clockwise. From what I can determine, it is spot on although I haven't done the simmer/icewater tests. I really couldn't be happier with it and have no intentions of replacing it in the forseeable future. Are there better units out there- sure enough, but I needed a working themo ASAP so I grabbed it. After using it for about 2 years now this one fits my needs."
1,Temperature indication is not even close.,"I installed this gauge on my Weber grill to help with indirect cooking and smoking. After a couple of grilling sessions, I found my food was cooking too quickly and drying out. I became suspicious of this gauge and checked its accuracy against an accurate digital thermometer. The digital thermometer showed 275 deg., while this gauge indicated only 230 deg. That's a -45 deg error so I recommend that you avoid this product."
5,Totally Awesome! Latino Singer,I got this Cd for my mom for Christmas.I think he is Totally Awesome!I saw him in November on The Rosie O'Donell Show talking about his wife and the baby they were expcting.
5,latin appreciation,a wonderfully upbeat heart touching cd. all ages shouldenjoy this addition to theircollection.
2,Where's all the music you can dance to?,"If I had wanted sappy songs, I could have bought a Julio Inglesias CD. I bought this CD hoping the whole album would sound like ""I Need to Know"", but instead I just skipped my way through most of the songs, having to scour through a lot of ballads to get to the (Too Few) dance songs. I guess I'll just have to try his earlier albums."
1,When you purchase from a Junk Dealer,"The CD arrived in a torn brown bag, loosely taped on the outside - upon opening the brown wrapper I was surprised to find the case taped together -upon opening the broken case, I found a CD that has some kind of dried food or milk product on one side and the recorded side was scratched heavily. This is truly a junk dealer to send something in this deplorable condition. There are really no words to describe my thoughts when I opened this CD. I just hope I did not catch something by opening this nasty package."
2,"Incredible voice, but bland songs","Marc Anthony undoubtedly has one of the best male singing voices going today, and ""I Want to Know"" is a great single. However, most of his English language is composed of sound alike ballads. I've listened to it a number of times since it was released, and most of the songs do not really stick out or are particularly memorable. One exception is ""She's Been Good to Me,"" which was produced by Rodney Jerkins and is an uptempo salsa-flavored song. Of note, several of the songs were co-written and produced by Walter Afanasieff, who did many of Mariah Carey's early ballads. If you like that kind of material, you'll probably like this CD - otherwise beware. A disappointment...hopefully his new CD, which will be released soon, will be more interesting."
2,Most of album is slow and not latin-sounding,"His hit songs are great, but the rest of the album is disappointing and doesn't sound latin. It borders on sappy '80s music. Definitely listen to the samples of the non-hits before you buy. I recommend Santana's new CD over this one."
2,Single's good... but what happened to the album?,I Need To Know is obviously the more outstanding of the lot; what the rest sounded like was rather dampening to the mood after all the hype about the salsa-hot I Need To Know single.. but perhaps Marc Anthony was trying to bring out the other side of Latin pop?...
3,Too many ballads...,"I bought this album because ""I Need To Know"", which is one of my favorite latin tracks. I was expecting more danceable latin songs, but this album includes only few uptempo songs... that was really disappointing! The ballads are okay, but there are too many of them and some ballads are really boring. The production is good, and Marc sounds phenomenal.I like Marc Anthony very much, but this is only average album. If you aren't fan of Marc, buy his Greatest Hits album instead of this... and after that, buy ""I Need To Know"" single!"
3,"Nice, but hardly new","Why do so many critics focus on a singer's race rather than his music? Is it multiculturalism or simply racism? Whatever the reason, Marc Anthony has released a CD of standard adult contemporary music that's very pleasant, very romantic, but hardly ground-breaking. If he were white or African-American, this CD probably wouldn't have garnered a lot of attention. But because Latin music is the flavor of the month, performers like Anthony are getting a lot more press than they really deserve. A nice album - nothing more."
2,CD sells on Showbiz review,"Yes, Marc Anthony is good, BUT he is no Ricky Martin. The sells of this CD will come from Marc Anthony fans and the ShowBiz review. The music arrangments and lyrics are average. The music style would sell in the Philippine market , but not in the U.S. market as a whole. I look forward to his next CD in hopes that it's a five."
5,The Ultimate Vocalist,"Not a lot of people can sing and touch your heart. Not a lot of people can sing and make you hear them. Not a lot of people sing with the music so harmoniously.Marc Anthony is not one of those people. He is able to do this and more in his English album debut. His songs are flawless and timeless. His voice is crisp and you can feel it from the heart whenever he recites the lyrics.There are a great melee of songs and I have to say all of them have their own identity and tone. Miraculously, I Need to Know and You Sang to Me, which were the singles released are not even the greatest in this bag of gems. Songs like Love is All and Remember Me, stand out. The Spanish music blends with his voice in great harmony.In all, this is a solid classic album that stands out even though it's nearly been 6 years since its release. Unfortunately, none of today's musicians can sing and choose their music as this great Latin entertainer."
2,"Salsa King, but not King of Pop","With all this crossover business happening lately, Marc Anthony's should have been the best one. He truly is an extremely talented individual compared to the rest of them.His ballads in his crossover album, I think, are typical pop music standards that anyone could release. ""I Need to Know"" is a excellent song and misled us to think the rest of the album is as good. His Enlgish salsa song, ""That's OK"", is what Marc Anthony fans are used to. Salsa is his strength not pop. There really should have been more songs with that style.I noticed that Emilio Estefan wrote a song on this CD. I don't know who told the Estefans that they are the authority in Latin-Style music, but the song doesn't work on any level. I wanted to like it, but there are too many things wrong it. Musically and vocally, it doesn't work.A man with such incredible talent can do much better."
2,Lukewarm about the Wipe Warmer,"I purchased this wipes warmer thinking it would make diaper changes during the chilly winter months a little more comfortable for my baby. I chucked it after only a couple months of use. As other reviewers have stated, the wipes stay warm for an infinitesimal amount of time once removed from the warmer. My other, larger issue with it was that it ruined the top of my wooden dresser - the area immediately beneath the warmer became warped. I'm not sure if it was heat or moisture or both that ruined the wood, but the split second of warmth from the baby wipes wasn't worth the damage to the furniture. Since some other reviewers had wonderful experiences with the warm wipes making diaper changes less irritating, my suggestion is to purchase a wipes warmer at a second hand store - you'll pay a fraction of the price (around here they usually sell for about $5), there are usually plenty to choose from on the shelves, and if you hate it you're only out $5 or so."
1,Do not waste yourmoney,"You have a spilt second to get the wipey out and then it gets cold. Not to mention the warm moist environment is a breeding ground for bacteria, especially if you are wiping, then put your hands back in to get another wipey."
2,Would like bigger selection from Target/Target.com,"My husband and I purchased this warmer with gift cards we received for our second baby's birth. We don't really like it. Our wipes dry out down to about the third, sometimes fourth wipe. That's makes for a 6-8 wipe diaper change! (that's a lot of wasted money) Other reviewers are right about the wipes staying moist when it is not as full. But with a newborn, infant or even a toddler I prefer the convenience of opening a refill pack and placing all of the wipes into the warmer instead of half the wipes in and then finding something to keep the second half moist until it's time to refill with the other half. We had a wrap-around warmer with our first child. It wore out around the time we started potty training her. That's the style of wipe warmer I would recommend for new parents, not this one."
5,Works Great!,"I love this product. I have last year's model, same length of cord, but the color is blue. I mounted up high in my garage, so it is out of the way. When you need the cord, just grab it and pull it where you need. It swivels so you can pull it in any direction. When you are done, just give it a tug and it winds back up. No more coiling electrical cords around my arms and trying to figure out where to store them. This product is sturdy, and does everything i would expect. Perfect for a workshop!"
4,Not One Infused!,"Beware that this is mistakenly listed in the One Infused category, so don't buy this thinking it is One Infused."
3,Easy Read,"I might recommend this book for a plane ride or a vacation at the beach. Not too taxing. The characters are sweet and the book is difficult to put down but it is a bit on the amateurish side (almost seemed like a book for teens, although the sex scenes are bit on the lurid side for that!) If you like this subject, there are more finely crafted novels by Juliet Marillier or Jules Watson that are much better written (and there is no dragon!). I think it looks like a good first effort, but I can't really recommend it."
4,"comfortable, easy to wear","This is a super comfortable bra, and the straps don't slip! It feels like wearing nothing, but modest and supportive."
4,Great for layering and modesty at work,"I ordered these to wear over my normal bras, but to lend some modesty in the office - while beating the heat. I don't always want to wear a full layer/tank under my usual tops. These look nice and hide the girls. As for sizing, I wasn't sure what to order. Typically I would be a medium, and that is what I purchased. As a layer, a medium fit fine. However, the bottom band, that goes around my chest is not tight at all, and in fact rides up a bit. Since I'm layering, I don't mind. But, as for a sports bra, I would say definitely size down if you want a more secure fit/support. I think the other reviewers are correct on ordering smaller than you normally would. I have some other bras I can wear around as lounge wear that are much more supportive. This isn't much different than a tank top for support. I'm about 5/7, 140, 34 B/C. I would order a small if I ordered again, that or add a little stitch to take in the bottom."
2,Not a sports bra,"I returned this item. It is advertised as a sports bra however it does not have any support at all. If you want a little half shell to wear under something, this top is fine but, that's it,"
1,Stupid,"Ok...want to save lots of money?? Fill a spray bottle with water, add a squirt of dishwashing liquid and a teaspoon or two of liguid laundry detergent that contains ENZYMES. VOILA! CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP!!! Works just as good, trust me."
5,Excelente libro.,Lo recomiendo a toda persona que sepa leer. Muy buenos ejemplos que sirven para eliminar los desenfoques de la vida.
1,No Good Men,"Bought this on the recommendation of someone I met recently. She mentioned it under the genre of the blues and said it was great music. Little did I know she was clueless about the blues or great music.This might have been interesting thirty years ago, but I doubt it."
1,Historic but really really bad,"This movie's claim to fame was its director, Norodom Sihanouk, the ruler of Cambodia until Nixon's ill-fated invasion in 1970. Sihanouk spent his time filing his nails in Phnom Penh, indulging in directing the occasional film, and brokering the occasional Vietnam deal as the only neutral in southeast Asia. See Angkor and Die is unbelievably sappy, though it does have some nice atmospheric shots of Angkor Wat. Worth owning for the die hard Vietnam era buff or for somebody who will never see Angkor before dying."
4,What is up with moms?,"Moms are being stubborn. What is wrong with the boy being a doctor and the girls being other things. This toy is going to have very little affect on what your daugther is going to be when she grows up. And if you never buy Polly Pockets for your daugther again, like Cathirine Murpy, you may make you daugther very sad. Especialy if she likes Polly Pockets. As a fact, back in the early 20th century, girls weren't allowed to be things like Vets and Artists. Artists always used to be boys! And if you didn't notice, there is a doctor outfit for the girls. Just because it's a dress and is white doesn't mean anything. Girls can be anything they want to be. I won't disaprove this toy at all, in fact, I approve it. It gives girls an idea about thing they can be. And if you don't like the set, don't buy it. Buy a different Polly Pocket toy."
4,It works fine!,"I have a bottle of the SUPER costly stuff - with healing essential oils - and couldn't see paying the SAME amount for one tiny bottle of said goo - when I could have this GIGANTIC ENORMOUS tub of goo for the same price, including the shipping! And since I need a LOT of the stuff because I hurt so friggin much - this stuff is great. And it looks pretty sitting on the shelf, glowing radiant blue, too!One trick - pour it into the little bottle OVER your sink. It's kind of hard to do - and the cube is a bit unwieldy - practice for a few minutes holding it and thinking the process through. LOL!"
2,DON'T BUY,"AFTER LOOKING UP WORDS, YOU STILL DON'T KNOW HOW TO PRONOUN THEM. THEY SHOULD HAVE USED LONG AND SHORT VOWELS."
5,"If you need a heroine, Desiree's for you!","I've been a faithful reader of Ms. Eichler's books since their inception and this is one of the best. I love Desiree's sense of humor, her acceptance of self (she's not sylph-like and doesn't mind). She's an everywoman, who knows what's important: shopping, Hagen Daas(sic), oh yeah, and catching the bad guy/girl. At least now I know when her next book's coming out - February. HURRY UP, FEBRUARY!"
5,Cute Video,I purchased this video for my granddaughter. She loves Max and Ruby. She has really enjoyed watching this video over and over.
3,One day Ruby's gonna snap,"This is a cute show and my 3-year old enjoys it. But it's quite odd in that no parents are ever seen, and Ruby is basically Max's parent all the time. Max is always with her; she bathes him, fixes his boo-boo's, puts him to bed, includes him in all her activities and play dates (which he is constantly messing up), and teaches him how to do things... all while exercising the patience of Mother Theresa -- she's much more patient that even most parents could be expected to be all the time, much less big sisters. Max seems to be perpetually either antagonistic or clueless, and only ever says one word or phrase at a time. It's not something that would prevent me from wanting kids to watch it, but it is perplexing. I prefer the more realistic family dynamics like in the Berenstain Bears, Little Critter, and Frances."
3,great for viewing - not so good for replacing the novel,"This movie does a pretty good job at following the themes and ideas of the novel, but it seriously strays from the novel. As a teacher, I am constantly looking for video forms of the novels we read in my classes. I read a review that said that this version followed the novel very well. I was disapointed when I saw how much this movie actually strayed from the plot of the novel. The relationship between the creation and Frankenstein is incorrect, major events are wrong, sometimes the order of events is wrong. This movie can be used for educational purposes, but it comes nowhere near replacing the novel.However, if you are looking for a fun and new twist to the story, this is the movie for you. It was very entertaining, and I enjoyed watching it."
5,Excellent overview,"I bought this CD for the relatively hard to find ""American Dreamer"" and ""Outlaw Song"" tracks, but was pleased to find that it is a very enjoyable collection of Clark's work. While I haven't checked out other Gene Clark compilations, this would be a very good place to start to sample his work over the years. Once you're hooked, his Byrds (first three albums) and solo efforts (esp. White Light and Roadmaster) would follow."
5,"Pretty large, just perfect fit.","This case just barely fit my m9 it has just enough breathing room. Its 11.5"" L x 2.75"" W x 7.5"" H..hope those dimensions help, also when i put the gun in i can either leave the mag out or in the gun and it will still fit in the case. Its a regular mag not extended, if you have an extended mag it may not fit."
4,Nice case for a nice price,"Nothing fancy. This is a perfect case to meet the legal requirements of having a hand gun cased (and locked if needed). It is built strong enough to take some rough handling. For the price, you can't beat it."
2,Weak,The pistol case cracked in four places the first time it was used. It was packed in a suitcase and protected. It can't handle a 1911 size gun because the plastic is too thin.
1,[Misleading] Nonsense,"This book is pure [nonsense]. The authors promote a ""one shot kill"" theory that favors (surprise!) light weight high velocity specialty ammunition.The problem is that they cite fictional sources (such as the Strasbourg ""goat tests"") that have never been pubished or reviewed. They also mis-cite several other published studies out of context and wrongly. Oh, by the way, several professional statisticians who have reviewed their data have concluded that it is fabricated."
1,Did not get order--twice!,"I ordered 2 Epil-Stops. I got an e-mail saying order was shipped, but did not receive it. I complained and got refund. Company apologized. I tried again, giving the company the benefit of the doubt. Again, I received an e-mail saying the 2 Epil-stops were shipped. I did not receive them again. I complained and got my money back. I have used [...] many times, and these were the only times I had a problem."
5,Zorro rocks!,"I bought this collection as a Christmas gift for my daughter (now in her early 20's), who loved this show when she was a child. It's campy, good clean fun and a must for any real Zorro fan (as I was back in the Guy Williams Disney Zorro days!)The only disappointment is the bonus disk. I thought it would have behind the scenes/bloopers from this series but it's old BW footage and shorts of other Zorros and an 'original' pilot for this series with all different cast members (except for Victoria) that is really bad! Thank goodness they recast and started from scratch!!Love it!"
1,The Complete Zorro,"This complete set is a waste of money. Poor acting, poor plots poor action. Not worth the time to watch it"
5,Better show than I remembered.,"I hadn't seen this show since it first came out. I thought it was an hour long show, but its still a very good show. A little tongue in cheek but still a good show. This Zorro leans a little toward Batman with his knowledge of science and his cave lab. One episode even guest stars 1966 Batman Adam West. This show is good family entertainment in a time when that is hard to find. Its not the Guy Williams Zorro but its pretty close. Duncan Regehr is perfect casting for Zorro/Don Diego and does a very good job with the dual role. I've enjoyed watching the show again after all these years. Solid action entertainment with a little comedy thrown in."
3,not greatly helpful,"for anyone who has given any thought to getting or staying organized while conducting forensic services, they've already generated most of these forms. i didn't find all that much in the way of direct aids to the practice of forensics. probably worth the purchase, used."
2,Colonna for the fourth grade reader.,"An earlier reviewer remarked ""Fortunately Joscelyn Godwin didn't try to reproduce Francesco Colonna's difficult and idiosyncratic Italian in English, otherwise the book would have been as difficult to read as 'Ulysses' and needed another volume just for footnotes."" The correct word is unfortunately. The present translation is a lifeless, dumbed down document. I wasted my money."
3,Only for students of English as a second language.,I can see that this book would be helpful to someone trying to learn English. A native speaker will find very little of interest here.
3,Not as good as we hoped.,We love Robbie Coltrane but he was not right for this part.His humour and dark side just were not given any direction here. Okay story but he can do so much more.! But better than most of the usual tv stuff.
2,It's like a CD that hasn't finished completion,"Like in ""Departure"": 'Here it comes, bad' All R.E.M. songs are solid unities of pure listening enjoyment and I am a very big R.E.M.-fan. But this is a R.E.M. CD not made by R.E.M. And that's what is wrong. Even as only-instrumental music, it isn't as good as the originals. But I guess that in the end, it's nice to hear the nice tunes of these classic songs. But it's lacking Stipe and Mills beautiful voices, Buck's superb guitar technique's and Berry's drums. Only for die-hard R.E.M.-fans who want everything that's R.E.M.-related. Maybe it can be used in the elevator of the R.E.M.-clubhouse."
4,"Ignore Ellwood, most serious magicians do","Ignore as someone has already said, the pure comedy of a disgruntled writer whose ideas probably did not get into the book because they've already been done to death (darling, pop culture god forms and sub-Grant M is so 1990s) and deal with the fact that this a fantastic collection of good, new writing on magic. With so many views on offer, some of it is certain not to rock your boat, but on the whole, this book as the esteemed Phil Hines said, 'kicks major ass'."
5,"Wow, what a groovy collection!","Generation Hex gives any reader an insightful slice of the personal journeys of the 14 individual contributers. While each of us has own own path to follow, the glimpse into others experiences is always an interesting view. Highly reccomended.Durk Simmons author Strings of Connection Book One of the Witches in America Series"
4,Nice personal touch on a piece of history,"Some of the biggest and most important innovations in American history took place with GE and at the Riverworks Plant in Lynn, MA. It was there that the first jet engine in the US fired up in the 1940's. None of the workers knew what they were working on at the time. The conjecture on the floor was that it was a huge supercharger. However, the machinists thought it would have to be for an unimaginably big engine, perhaps for a huge ship. The plant also served as a secure storage facility for some of Britain's large diesel engine and ship components because of the plant's location. It's a nice history of a 20th century factory that helped make America great and a partial story of a truly great American company."
5,A good introduction to storm chasing.,"A fairly comprehensive guide to introductory storm chasing. A little more info on the forecasting would have been good, though much of it is covered in Vasquez's Weather Forecasting Handbook. After a one-week storm tour with Silver Lining Tours in 2003, this book really helped me to make sense of the things that I saw and springboarded me on a year of research so that I will be better prepared for my 2004 storm chase with SLT. The tips that were included gave me the goal of trying to see something other than a tornado (which we did not see on the tour last year). It made me realize the beauty of other storm structures to the point where now I just take delight in sitting and watching cumulus clouds rise and fade. Thank you, Tim Vasquez, for helping to ensure that this year's chase will be even more fulfilling than last year's!"
2,Not good at all,"_The Barsukov Triangle_ and other stories are excellent examples of ""socialist literature"" - stories written during the Soviet era, and with the supervision and examiniation of Soviet authorities. This is glaringly apparent in the shocking mediocrity and generally poor quality of the stories.The Barsukov Triangle, for example, is a rip-off of every book, script and story about the Beruda Triangle, with the exception that is it set in the Soviet Union. Characters are all stereotypes of the ""ideal"" Soviet man (and woman), in an idealized USSR where the shelves are stocked, there are no ques, and everyone is happy to be working towards socialism in one country. In other words, its bad. Really bad.However, I have to give it two stars precisely because it is such an excellent example of the literature that the Soviet Union produced for mass comsumption. But readers beware."
4,Decent product,"This is a very nice and light moisturizer, and very gentle on sensitive skin. However I'm not really sure if it helps too much with redness."
4,great as usual... but,"i really like hillsong, so it's kind of hard for me to mention any downside. this DVD is great, but the subtitles seem to be out of focus..."
5,THE GREATEST ELVIS COLLECTION,"I have been an Elvis fan since 9 or 10 years old, and now am 68. So of course I think anything Elvis is cool!"
4,Solid performance,"J. Steven York does a solid job on this book, i had heard of the Sandovals on the previous books, but J. Steven York does an extraordinary job with the characters, the plot is solid.Excelent work!!"
5,Wonderful hand cream,"I borrowed a touch of this hand cream from a friend and immediately found it creamy, moisturizing and fragrant. Hours later I was still enjoying it's light sweet scent. The next day, I made my way to the mall in search of Archipelago Soy Milk hand cream."
3,Just a recopilation,"I haven't listened to this new CD from Hart Rouge. So, I don't know if there are new versions from their two last CDs: Nouvelle France and Beaupre's Home, there is just one new song in it. I hardly recommend this group but, in this case, this new CD is just a recopilation of their last works."
5,Excellent resource,When it is impossible to find an explanation for a question about French grammar this book seems to always have the answer. The explanations are good and accompanied by a lot of examples. It doesn't have anything on pronunciation...it is just about grammar. I'm really thankful that a friend told me about this book!
3,Converts to Mono,"The biggest flaw with this product is that it seems to convert to mono from stereo audio sources. It's certainly not perfect, but what kind of solution for 9+ year old cars could be? This might not even b an issue for everyone who purchases it. The only other problem is that during the install finding a ground can be frustrating. The difficulty of the install is moderate, though special tools are required to remove the radio and getting the unit into a place where it fits is difficult without removing dash panels.Overall it gets the job done, but isn't a perfect product because of the stereo issue."
1,Don't Buy It. It Doesn't Work.,"The product arrived defective. It combined the stereo input into mono output. Even worse, it seemed to have some sort of phase reversal that wiped out any sounds originally ""centered"" in the stereo mix, e.g., the vocal and the bass.This problem was discovered only after paying over $150 to have the unit professionally installed. I also further verified the problem by routing around the pro installation, i.e., plugging my audio source directly into the defective unit. This alternate wiring produced the same result, showing that the problem is with the purchased part.I have since bought a different interface from Amazon that works perfectly with my wiring and installation.After submitting a return request, I was contacted by the seller and returned the part to them the next day. That is the last that I have heard from them. Now Amazon is saying that it will take them at least another two weeks to decide if I am worthy of a refund."
2,But Here's a Better Book For You,"The information in this book is vague, hazy and totally non-motivating. Please, before you spend $$$ on Eating Mindfully purchase The Seven Secrets of Slim People. It is focussed, dense with wisdom and EXCELLENT exercises that develop your sane sense of how, why and when you eat so that you can lose that obsessive relationship you now have with food. Eating Mindfully will leave you treading water with no shore in sight.The Seven Secrets of Slim People"
4,"She's okay,","But I like Sasha and Jade better. She's cute though. She has brown hair with blond highlights and big hazel eyes and her beauty mark looks so cute!Her first outfit is a pink tank top with a silver necklace design. Her skirt is a strange black, pink, and gold pattern. Her shoes are pink with small gold hearts and a yellow ""stone"" in the middle.Her second outfit is a black tank top with a silver chandelier design. Her jeans are light blue with flower designs and a silver and hot pink fringe over it. Her shoes are black mary janes with red designs on them.Thanks for reading my review! Hope you enjoy her!"
3,A large number of short selections,"I keep this book handy, but I rarely need to find anything in it. Marx had a lot of great ideas, and scholars have tried to put limits on his most important doctrines. But this book, with many short sections split into 8 parts by grand topic headings and also by year, gives us: Young Marx 1841-1843, Alienation 1844, Critique of the Philosophical Tradition (Hegel, Feuerbach) 1844-1846, The Materialist Conception of History 1845-1877, The Politics of Revolution 1844-1875, The Theoretical Analysis of Capitalism 1857-1883, Imperialism 1853-1882, and The Democratic Road to Socialism 1850-1880. The final section 57. Against ""Personality Cults"" is one of the shortest. Part of belonging to a secret society was the condition of Engels and Marx demanding ""that everything tending to a superstitious belief in authority was to be removed from the statutes."" (p. 502, from Marx to W. Blos, November 10, 1877). Read it and weep."
2,Liked it until it broke,"We bought this about 2 years ago. It looks great and we liked the fact that the jar is glass and the base has a clean stainless look. We use it often to make smoothies with juice, frozen fruit, etc.However, it started breaking down in the last 6 months. My husband keeps tightening the blades inside the blender, but it has broken down to the point where we can't use it anymore. We may try to get it repaired, but it would probably cost the same to buy another, less expensive blender. I don't know how long a blender should last, I just wish this one would have held up longer. I wouldn't buy another one; it doesn't seem worth the money."
2,Broke down after 2 months,"I bought this blender to make fruit smoothies (mostly strawberry) for my athletic husband and son. I bought a ""top-of-the-line"" because I knew it would get heavy use. It worked perfectly for about 2 months, and then I had to take it in to the authorized repair shop in our city for a new blade assembly because it no longer blended the frozen fruit; this was done under warranty at no cost to me. The repairman said to add the liquid first, and then add the fruit through the hole in the lid while the motor was running because the blades don't grind frozen fruit--they cause it to ""explode"". I took the repaired blender home, where it made 2 or 3 good fruit smoothies before going back to its old trick of not blending the frozen fruit again. It will still make shakes with ice cream and the like, but forget the fruit smoothies. So I guess I'll be going back to the repair shop and seeing what can be done--or asking for a replacement."
1,Junk,"Couldn't slice through warm butter. First time I used it, to make a smoothie, couldn't chop through frozen fruit. I'm returning this pile of junk! As with most things these days, the quality of previous years isn't there. I'd recommend looking for a vintage model on ebay."
5,Fascinating and Inspirational Reading,"A Different Kind of Strength: Rediscovering the Power of Being a Woman, is fascinating and inspirational reading that goes beyond the scriptures to bring five women of the Bible to life. You will thoroughly enjoy reading about Rahab, Tamar, Bathsheba, Ruth and Mary as you gain new insights into their lives. Once you have read A Different Kind of Strength, you will always remember how God used these ordinary women. You will be inspired to see how God can use each of us regardless of our own weaknesses. I highly recommend this book by two talented writers, Beverly LaHaye and Janice Shaw Crouse."
1,Tough book to learn from,"I have tried to wade through this book twice and haven't been able to get far. The explanations are either missing or opaque. The author has you typing commands that you don't understand, then he tells you not to worry if you don't understand what you are doing. Not very helpful! There really is no reason he can't explain what some of the commands mean. In short, this book is a frustrating waste of time and one learns little about game programming. I am now looking for a replacement."
1,Agree with the last review,"Ok, yes, 2005? VB6??? Are you aware that Microsoft has discontinued selling and supporting this software?? This software was first published in 1999!!! Find a book that is using a little bit more of state of the art technology. This one is a waste of time and money."
4,Don't settle for getting old,"Very interesting book. This book provides a very clear pronouncement that you don't have to settle for aging - that the primary age markers can be improved with a plan and action, both of which are explained in this book. It goes deeply into the science and explains itself completely. My only reservations about the information presented is that 1) the book is over 10 years old - I wish there was an updated edition and 2) giving checklists and worksheets on the actions required would be more helpful and 3) this book spends very little time on the nutritional aspects of improving biomarkers. But for the information it presents, it is a winner."
5,Review of Peasnt Families in Medieval England,The book arrived in good shape and I am enjoying reading it. The work heps round out my knowledge of medieval times.
4,Stoyanova steals the show!,"A generally fine modern Otello, drmatically convincing and well sung. Stoyanova, a new discovery for me, is in vocal league of her own among this bunch. Cura throws himself into the role, but shows some vocal fatigue and forced sound. Ataneli's Iago and other supporting roles are less well done."
5,"Good Clips, Good Service","As has already been mentioned, these are utility carabiners, not meant for climbing. Although I imagine that anyone that climbs would already know the difference. I bought them for general purpose use. I'm using one to clip my chalk bag to my harness, and the others get to share duties on my kayak, attaching various bits and pieces to the deck rigging. They're much higher quality than most keychain-style carabiners, so if those make you nervous for your purposes, then I'd recommend these. The price is good, and while they're not climbing grade, they are very strong. And for the price of 6, you can't even get one climbing grade carabiner.Oh, and service was excellent as well. I paid for standard shipping when I ordered on a Thursday afternoon, and the package was waiting for me at the house when I got home from work on Monday. That's quick!"
1,Could Not Watch at least 15 Minutes of the Movie,"I thought this movie was going to be a little funny. Boy was I wrong. I probably did not watch fifteen minutes of this mess of a movie. Too much profanity for starters. Cameron Diaz character from the jump start did not show much promise. They protrayed her as a gold digging foul mouthed user of men and people. The things some people do for money. Eventually, her foul mouth and acting made it hard for me to watch the movie any further.If I could, I would have given her 1/2 a star."
2,Horrible period!,Plot was lame.Bad acting! Gave it 2 stars cause thats about how many times I laughed.I dont recommened this movie. Wait til it comes out on cable.
1,How Much Longer Will Hollywood Put Out This Crap?,"If you like sophomoric, crude language sexual humor, go for it. Great movie for a bunch of high school reprobates with a 24 pack of beer, no hope of ever dating and no car to drive. But would you want to take your kid to this movie? I wouldn't even take a neighbor to this piece of trash. Even if they're the ones buying the 24 pack."
1,Horrible.,"If I could give this .01 of a star, I would. This was by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The characters had no personality, the story line had no point, the ending made no sense, skipping from one thing to another and I found it so boring I actually fell asleep about 45 minutes in. Cameron Diaz's character was so vulgar and such a B&$%# I found myself wanting to punch her in what seemed to be this movies center of attention,(her chest). Don't let the all star cast fool you. This isn't the product of bad acting, but bad writing. Very bad writing. This possibly could have been a good movie with a little more effort from the writer and director. Instead it just turned out to be 97 minutes of my life that I will never get back. The only character who actually got a smile out of me was Jason Segel's,(the gym teacher), but in the end it was just that, a smile. Huge disappointment...I'm really peeved I spent money on this."
1,worst movie ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this is the worst movie i have ever seen. it is just stupid, boring, tedious, no theme, no finale, no trama. please, dont waste your money like i did."
5,Cracked me up!,"This movie cracked me up! I wasn't really expecting to like the movie, maybe that is why I liked it so much! Phylllis smith from the show The Office was hilarious. Maybe it just caught me in a mood, but I really enjoyed it!"
3,"Boring Beginning, Entertaining Middle and End","If I could give this movie a ""pretty good"" 3.5 stars I would. I'm a fan of Cameron, Justin, and Jason and the previews made this one of those movies that I felt I absolutely HAD to see. The first half of the movie was honestly very disappointing. It was boring and the scenes were so choppy. It was like...here is scene 1. Now scene 2. Now scene 3 and none of the scenes flowed or came together. I barely laughed in the first half. The Christmas scene and onward is when things picked up and I began to enjoy the movie. There was much more humor and it was fun seeing what the bad teacher would do next. Nothing was off limits for her. For me, the awful beginning and awesome ending cancels out so it's an ""okay"" movie at worst and ""good"" at best."
5,Laugh a minute!,"Normally I am not a fan of Cameron Diaz, but here, in Bad Teacher, she shines. It may be her best work that she will ever accomplish. You want to hate her, but you can't. She's too funny. She's mean, and raunchy, and so unbelievably gorgeous it's disgusting, but she ROCKS this role. This movie reminds me of another one of my favorite, quirky high school themed movies, Election. Sit back, relax, watch this movie and prepare to be entertained! IT'S SO BAD TO BE GOOD!!!!!!!!"
3,it's an okay movie,there's nothing super special about this movie you pretty much know what's going to happen before it happens but it's worth a watch
1,?????????????????????????,BAD TEACHER (2011) Directed by Jake Kasdan.Starring Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake.An amoral golddigging drug taking woman takes a job as a middle school teacher where she causes general havoc and destroys the life of a fellow teacher before living happily ever after.A comedy?Crude. Obscene. Nihilistic. Unpleasant. There was not one moment where I found this an even moderately pleasant viewing experience. I have no idea what the intentions of the filmmakers were. I have no idea just who this thing was intended for. Consequently I can offer no critique of it. It is simply foreign to my experience.
3,Cute At Best,"I was wanting to enjoy this movie. Cameron Diaz was as good as ever but the writing just did not grab me. If you are in to romantic comedies and enjoy looking at Cameron Diaz, you might give this a try. If by chance you want to laugh out loud or expect quality in your movies, you might pass on this one."
1,Bad Teacher = Bad Movie,"I just finished watching this really bad movie and thought I'd jump over to Amazon and see what others thought of it. Not surprised that there are more 1 star ratings for this than 4 stars. Can't believe C Diaz actually read the script before shooting this and still continued. Her career is really in a tailspin after this kind of crap. There's the good part of Hollywood, and then there's this. If Amazon had a way to award 1/2 star that's what it's worth. Maybe not even that much. What's next for Diaz... a TV sitcom? Wouldn't be surprised."
4,A pleasant surprise.,"A reluctant teacher loses her wealthy fiancé' and thus has to return to the job she hates. Desiring breast implants, she pursues the bonus awarded to the teacher whose class has the highest test scores. Along the way she is pursed by a gym teacher, tries to connect with a rich substitute, and finds a rival in a fellow teacher, the funniest and most well-developed character in the film. This is a movie that I found funny and refreshing, in that it is not laced with vulgarities and profanity throughout. This is a movie that provides laughs while not seeking the lowest common denominator. A pleasant surprise."
2,"Could of, Should of not watched the whole moview",Very Slow at times with no plot and not very funny. There were plenty of opportunities for much better scenes and lines but the writers just missed it all.
2,Bad teacher and BAD Movie,I thought this was a stupid movie. It was boring and I fell asleep watching it the first time. Glad I did not waste my money and just rented it. I thought for sure it would be funny after seeing her star in Something about Mary.
1,BAD TEACHER - JUST BAD,"This movie isn't worth the first notion of putting this non-story on cellulose.The time is worth far too much to spend on this movie mistake.It will be hard to view another Carmen Diaz the same after seeing this bomb.This movie was so bad that I couldn't even give it a whole twenty minutes before turning it off and watching Sharktopus on the SyFy channel. Hey, at least Sharktopus was a real comedy. Wasn't it?If you want to break up with your girlfriend, take her to see this movie, get up to go to the restroom, and leave. This movie has even less class than that.Recommendation: Make yourself some popcorn, share it with your girlfriend, and watch Sharktopus instead."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"Bad Teacher is a bad movie. Billed as the raunchiest film since Bad Santa, my expectations were high. As far as I'm concerned, the raunchier the better, but seldom is a film that calls itself raunchy, actually raunchy. Cameron Diaz was terrific, but the story was extremely weak. There is zero character development, I wanted to punch most of the supporting cast, and as far as being funny, it's only good for a snicker here and there. It's a predictable story about a gold digger seeking money to get plastic surgery. Parts of it are painful and the rest of it is just really stupid. Honestly, if it wasn't for the use of the F word, this movie would be rated PG-13 at best. Diaz is a fantastic actress and the story had so many possibilities, but they were all overlooked. The result, another mediocre, overrated, comedy billing itself as raunchy."
1,Don't waste your money or time watching this movie!!!!!,"Bad plot, tiring to watch main charactor betray everyone and everything. Halfway though the movie we switched it off, we truly wasted out money."
2,Didn't Dig Digging,"I found this book rather boring. Every time I thought something interesting was going to happen, nothing did."
1,Such an Uninteresting Book,"Got (tediously) halfway through 'Digging to America' last night and am puzzled about its 'National Bestseller' status... I just can't relate to a character named Bitsy-ugh. The truth is, EVERY character was equally shallow. And now I'm irritated about this gross waste of my precious time! I wanted more insights about little Susan's personality, as she seemed the most interesting by far--but I am not going to finish this book to find out if she ever evolves. Even the pathetic attempts writing about foreign foods lacked description--so mundane."
1,Beyond painful,"i just kept thinking, what's the payoff? Will Arrival Day bring the arrival of a nuclear bomb? Or the bubonic plague, to wipe out the most tedious and irritating characters ever created? Will Piranahconda suddenly rise from the toilet and devour the entire freakishly extended clan... PLEASE?I read this because there was literally nothing else in the house I hadn't read, and I vaguely remembered enjoying an Anne Tyler novel years back...I should have dropped it after the first chapter, but I couldn't actually believe it was just going to meander along and then stop, for no apparent reason. The only note in the entire book that rang true was when there was something about one of the kids hating Arrival Day. Yeah, me too, kid."
4,Adoption - family versus culture,As a grandmother of three adopted children - one of whom is from a foreign country - I was quite interested in how these two families handled the assimulation of the child into the family. Also of interest was the reaction of grandparents and other family members to the new baby. I was delighted in the characters. This is one book that has much to teach us.
4,A Lovely Story,"This book was beautifully written and fun to read. The author captured what it is like to be a foreigner, being in but not of another culture. She also seems to understand how living in another culture changes a person so that she doesn't feel totally at home anywhere.The characters in the book, while sometimes seeming like ""types"" were certainly ""types"" I have seen and known and therefore they were real and believable.I would recommend this book."
2,What Happened to Anne Tyler?,"What a disappointment this book was! I certainly expected a lot more out of Tyler. The character's were shallow and the plot never really went any where. I love Tyler's other books, and kept expecting this one to go somewhere. It never did. In addition to this, about 2/3 of the way through some of the characters started being referred to in the third person. It was as though the book had changed authors. It was most aggravating. Don't waste you time reading this book."
3,Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah,"The book started out in a grand and exciting manner and ended with a flourish, but everything in between was too long and prolonged -- the plot dragged out and was almost as boring as one of those jello salads with bits of pineapple that some people always seem to bring to pot-lucks."
2,"What, another birthday????",I found this book very boring. Tyler does a good job on detailing the charictors but I kept waiting for something to happen. Poor Maryam never developed into a person she was so caught up in trying to be a properAmerican. I will read another of her books since she is so well thought of.
2,Nothing Happened,"I was so eager to get this book and received it as a Christmas present. I quickly got into the story but then nothing happened. You keep waiting for something to happen and it never does. The book ends with some of the story hanging, not knowing what happened to some of the characters. I felt very disappointed at the finish."
1,Where's my insulin?,A collection of nice pleasant songs of the sort found on soundtracks for any number of movies or TV shows based on coming of age or love in the mid to late 1960s. There are a number of well-known groups on the CD; The Association for example. That this was a follow-up to a similar product from the year before is shocking in that it implies the former was a financially successful endeavor. It's the sort of material whose sugar-coated gobbely-gook lyrics and production provided a catalyst for punk.
3,Disorganizaed but essential,"This read bills itself as a collection of Gnostic readings, which is to say the Gnostic Bible. But the title is deceiving as the book is in fact not a Bible at all, it is just a collection of disorganizaed poetry and documents, none of which seem to form a story or a biblical narrative. In some ways the setup mirrors the Qur'anic setup where seemingly unrelated passages are jumbled together but at least the Qur'an as reason(its longest to Shortest in Surah's), this `Bible' is not a bible but just a collection of unimportant little readings. The Gnostics and Gnosticism was a very important movement in the first centuries after Christ and this `Bible' does not do them justice. Their should be better sources for an actual Bible used by the Gnosts rather then just a collection of Gnostic and pseudo-Gnostic literature.Seth J. Frantzman"
1,Was given the wrong item,I am very disappointed by which book was sent to me. I had ordered the Gnostic Bible not some novel called Gnosis.
3,willing to try anything,"my mom recommended this to me for my oily/breakout prone skin... it really dries out my skin a lot, so I can't use it in the fall/winter. But for summer its great. The smell takes some getting used to but overall its a decent product and worth a try if you're struggling to find a solution for bad skin"
1,Not user friendly,"This item did not work well on my laptop computer. It ran slowly. I think this is because the item is out-dated. It is compatible with OS up to Windows NT. Besides being out-dated, it is totally not user friendly. It took me quite a while to figure out how to get to a concordance and then I still couldn't find the scripture that I was looking for. I am definitely not satisfied with this product. It's next destination is most likely the trash."
2,Buy it if you have to,"I had to use this book for a class at National University. What a coincidence it was written by a professor at NU! ... The book is biased and doesn't go in depth into anything. Most of us in my class figured we had to buy this book to line Ryan's pockets, none of us really cared for it much..."
5,A practial book,"I have read and been assigned numerous books to read during my credentialing program and beyond. As a young teacher I often sought resources to help whenever possible. In general I found that most books were full of theory but limited on practice and practical advice. I have to say that this book's approach was much more helpful in dealing with practical situations in the classrooms. When so many books on theory abound, there seems to be a significant disconnect in applications to the classroom. This book makes great connection to the classroom and it's approach is both great as a preparatory tool for teaching, and as a resources for teaching in increasingly diverse classrooms."
2,Woefully outdated book,"This book was written in 1999 in an age before ready access to health information and support through the Internet and has not been updated since then (don't go by the date next to the publisher's information). It is a VERY basic primer, a mere introduction for parents. Spend your money on a more current and in-depth book."
1,Thumbs down get his Anthology instead!,What a lousy collection to listen here. There's not enough song tracks covering Joe Cocker's entire rock music career major highpoints. So I prefer his two double-disc [BOX] set CD is much better to own for an investment buy!
5,This is the essential pregnancy book,"This is a wonderful book. I have read 3 pregnancy books, one of them the famous What to Expect, I like this one much better, it has a lot more information. I always come back to this book because it is so complete, realistic, precise, and easy to read. It has everything you need to have a good pregnancy. It is the book to get if you only want one book. I wish that William and Martha Sears were my doctors and I wish even more that Martha could be my labor assistant."
3,Ok book but confusing in its dating,"As some reviewers have mentioned, the way the book dates your pregnancy is always 2 weeks behind the doctor's so at times it gets confusing - and when you're pregnant, a lot of things become confusing!! It also doesn't talk too much about problems you may experience during pregnancy and what you can do about it."
2,Still Confused,I am an MBA student and ordered this book in the hopes that it would be more readable than the text assigned. It is not. I am no closer to grasping this subject than I was at the beginning of the semester and out an additional $13.56.If you are looking for a different perspective on the subject that makes it more understandable; this book is NOT for you.
2,Another boring book,"Based on the catchy title, I had hoped the book would be entertaining, like the ""How to Ace Calculus"" series. The title, alas, is a bait and switch, perhaps added as an afterthought by the publisher. I teach mathematics, and this book was no better or worse than the average dry textbook. It even has the usual incredibly boring chapter titles like ""Data Description- Numerical Measures of Variability for Ungrouped Univariant Data."" No wonder regular students find statistics so dry and confusing. Starving students would do better to buy a used statistics textbook at a ""Friends of the Library"" sale."
5,They laughed when I called up Excel ...,I'd read and digested the excellent Cartoon Book of Stats and was ready to move on to something heavier but not too professional. I'm running a customer service survey that needs knowledgeable slicing and dicing of the data and some convincing chatter to wow the top brass. This book empowers and informs.
3,"Pretty good, but not perfect","I bought this book to refresh my stale statistics knowledge. The explanations in the book are straightforward and everything, so far, seems to be explained fairly well. My one complaint is that the chapter headings are not on par with the way the rest of the book is written or focused. For example, Ch. 4 is titled ""Data Description - Numberical Measures of Position for Ungrouped Univariate Data"" huh? I just think for easier reference and understanding, the chapter titles could be more descriptive in layman's terms rather than in statistics jargon; which is what I thought the book was supposed to do in the first place."
1,Worst paper & printing quality ever,"Usually I wouldn't ""judge a book by it's cover"" but this really is a bridge too far.In the 70s and 80s I frequently received book presents from my East German relatives. I always thought that these had the worst printing and paper quality imaginable. Until I received my copy of this book: It is printed on the cheapest wood pulp I've ever seen and the printing quality is so bad that the pictures look like if they were ""stonewashed""."
4,A little to much...,"There was a little to much back and forth for my taste, but overall it was a great story =)"
1,Free Shipping Sucks,"I ordered this item February 1, 2010. I just received notification that this ""in stock"" item will arrive on January 16th.Looks like it is a deliberate ploy to encourage you to buy a faster method of shipping.Come on. 15 days for an ""in stock"" item?Ridiculous"
4,"No nonsense, high quality knife","I have this knife's bigger brothers: Models 110 and 112. Just had to complete the set with this smaller pocket version. It's well made and will last for a long time just like it's brothers. Buck makes a great knife and this one is a simple, no nonsence, quality knife that holds a great edge."
1,"Agree with previous review=Should have stayed ""Unreleased""(!)","I *love* Darin, but not this horrible CD. Capital was right not to release this material originally, and now they're cashing in by peddling crud.The songs are boring and monotonous, the arrangements are unimaginative yet they still manage to be too elaborate with background vocals way too intrusive and therefore overshadowing Darin's voice. And The Man's vocals are totally uninspired and flat - with (uncharacteristically) little personality or spark. He's really not stylizing or personalizing these songs. His voice doesn't even sound that great on the few tunes where the other vocalists don't drown him out.I think even the most definitive Darin music collection can do without this one. If this was the only Darin CD I ever heard I would have no idea why he is considered such a great singer and star by so many, myself included."
4,Hard-to-forget film; give it a chance!,"I am a fan of several of Atom Egoyan's films, and was curious about the milieu of this one. Since seeing it, I find my mind drifting back to it with some consistency; empirically speaking, I know it affected me on some levels that I'm only dimly aware of. I thought Kevin Bacon's take on a character meant to remind us of the older Jerry Lewis was rich and daring; Colin Firth made an indelible impression as his straight man, the repressed but debonair Brit standing in for Dean Martin's suave Italian-American. Alison Lohman seems not quite up to her key role, and I found myself wondering if Egoyan might have had someone more cerebral like Sarah Polley (he cast her so perfectly in The Sweet Hereafter) in mind instead. A classic whodunit dressed up in artsy chronology, you will find yourself changing your mind a few times about what really happened before the final scenes."
3,Professional relationship ruined by a secret,"Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon play two professional entertainers complementing each other's act. As a duo they can sustain each other and without mutual empowerment in their creative art they are just two lonely helpless men. They share everything, their professional life, women they meet, the butler, schedule that overlaps both their personal and professional life.It is at one moment when they believe that they have met an innocent, pretty hotel maid that their lives start to unravel. The experiences that unfold from that encouter ruin their lives irrevocably. 15 years later, they no longer perform together and it is a young journalist with desire to prove herself who decides to uncover truth that haunted them both for all those years.As a young journalist unfolds the truth, the lives of all involved drift apart at the point of no return."
3,Good information,"Having direct experience with this disorder, present in several members of my family, I was curious and sought more information. This video is told by people dealing with their own bipolar disorder, sharing how they've coped --- or not --- with past episodes. I found lots of insight listening to the stories. What was most hopeful was how these folks learned to see themselves slipping and how to ask for help. Some needed to have others see their changes and to intervene. The emphasis is on living a fairly normal life with the disorder and in spite of the disorder. It helps me better to understand. (It isn't an exciting or particularly slick production but it does offer good information. Not bad at all!)"
1,Advertised Package,"The Camera is supposed to come with a Camera Dock and bonus CF card, this is a big part of why I chose this camera. I did not get these. I am very disappointed. I am still trying to contact Amazon.com to get this resolved."
5,Great Camera! Great Price!,"I bought this camera about a month ago and I love it... Everybody that I show my printed pictures to can not believe that these pictures were printed from my computer... I just wished I had waited a little longer before I bough it since the price has gone down in price since I purchased it... I would highly recommend this camera to anyone... Did a lot of comparison shopping & I always ended up back to this camera for it's value, price and quality of pictures... Video is not that great but not horrible either... Pictures come out fantastic...Enjoy your new camera"
5,Digital Dandy,"Price to feature ratio great. Not too pretty, but easy to read instructions, easy to use, and takes great pictures. If a picture is not to your liking you can take it again or spruce it up with the easy to use software. You get the flash when you want it and the zoom features are more than adequate. It bounces off the kitchen floor as well as any of the more expensive cameras and keeps on clicking. Very satisfied with this unit, and with an extra $15 rechargeable battery pack it is all my wife and I need for a first point-and-shoot digital camera!"
3,You have to take what's available,"This is a decent representation of Rafferty's work from his early folk duo,The Humblebums (partnered with Billy Connolly, no less) to his early 80's solo work and the wonderful ""Baker Street."" There are a number of quality tunes here and the chatty liner notes proved to be an interesting retrospective of Rafferty's career, but as another reviewer noted, this package is lacking some key songs. At least try to collect all the singles from the time period. I am ofetn disappointed by the lack of completeness with these greatest hits sets, but sometimes you have to take what's available."
3,"Nice, but dont move it too much","I have owned this shower head for about four months. I liked it for the first month or so, there was a very noticeable change in feel of the way the water hit my body. There is a good amount of water that comes out and it feels soothing and very evenly spread, way better than the shower head I originally had.However, if you need to adjust it often, then the joints don't hold too well. In my house, we are short and tall, so it is constantly adjusted. Now water squirts out of the joint where it is moved higher or lower. Also, the holes where the water exits the shower head get clogged. I have to get a needle to unplug two or three of the holes every week or so."
2,It's a plain old showerhead,"There really isn't anything special about it. It's a cheap plastic showerhead with a small arm. There isn't anything called a ""rain"" setting, it's just jets of water."
4,got excatly as pictured,"As described, great product, got excatly as pictured. Would buy again. Quality is ok. What else need I say? I am satisfied. Using as a tackel box"
4,"Good, sturdy tool box.",Not a bad tool box at all. Definitely well worth the price. I'm using it basically as a catch-all for all my tools around the house and it is more than sufficient for the job.
2,Dumpster Diving,"There is a good bit of information between the covers of this title, but finding it is like diving for good stuff in a dumpster. One could do without the ad hominium remarks. I fell I must rewrite/organize it for it to be of much value."
1,Unreadable,"I just tried to read this book but I had to put it down. Unfortunately, the author, Joshua M. Greene is not a particularly good writer. The stilted prose reads like it was written for 11-year-olds.I wanted to learn more about George Harrison and his spirituality - honestly, I did. George Harrison was a huge influence on me when I was young, and he helped steer me onto a spirtual path.But I started reading this book and it opened with the same Beatles biographical information that I've already read 100 times. Paul met John and George met Paul and John thought George was a pain and he was young and he had big ears and John's mother was killed and he was raised by his Aunt Mimi and the music from America came to Liverpool before the rest of England...WHO NEEDS TO READ THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN???Not me. I don't have the time. I returned the book to the library."
5,An amazing read,"This book gives insight to George Harrison that is rarely talked about, much less written about. It is clear and concise and it gives one a flavor of the real person, with all his humanity, faults, and yet his loving spirit."
3,The silent Beatle,"Not a great book, drags quite a bit in places. But if you can stay on regardless, it does give you a good look into the life of the silent Beatle. More importantly, it throws light on how George musically influenced the Beatles songs we've all come to love and sing, when most of the credit has historically been given to the genius of John & Paul. If you're a Beatle fanatic, then its worth a one-time read."
1,Look elsewhere for good parking mat,This is made of plastic. It does not lay flat on the floor and slides easily. No adhesive came with product. Not useful unless secured to floor.
4,Awesome,"Picking up where New Beginnings left off, X-Force: The Final Chapter collects the final issues of the Peter Milligan/Mike Allred X-Force before it would be re-launched as X-Statix (which has sadly just ended). Continuing the idea of a commercial based mutant team brought together to pretty much make money, the group is joined by the appropriately named Dead Girl, and introduced to the Spike and Lacuna. The book is surprisingly action packed and Milligan's storytelling is simply awesome, and his Doop story is worth the price of admission alone. Those used to the other militaristic team X-Men books or the old X-Force books may have a hard time getting into Mike Allred's art or the sheer absurdity of the story, but it's sure worth a look, and once it would get re-launched as X-Statix would this become something really special."
3,Scope won't stay adjusted.,"Other than the screws working loose I find little falult with the rifle, however, the scope will not stay adjusted. There is a big difference in the quality of pellets. The best pellets I have found are Crossman Ultra Magnum 10.5g."
3,unknown,Too soon to determine if the red yeast has had any effect in lowering my cholesterol. It takes at least 120 days or more to determine if the red yeast rice has had any impact in lowering my cholesterol
4,Tasty licks by an old pro,"Fans of the instrumental side of Fairport Convention should dig this pair of recordings by their longtime fiddler, Dave Swarbrick. A bunch of his Fairport buddies, Richard Thompson among them, join him on this mostly-instrumental outing... Both albums were recorded at the same time in 1981, but released separately for whatever reason. It's nice stuff, though surprisingly heavy on standard-issue reels and such. For my personal tastes, there are too few numbers that really moved me (I tend to like aires and more melodically evocative tunes...) but I'm sure fans of fiddling in general and Fairport in particular will find plenty to enjoy here. A couple of songs do include vocals -- a rare opportunity to hear Swarbrick step up to take the mic..."
5,It was a good book!!!,My girlfriend enjoyed the book very much. She's a fan of Zane and this book is a reason why.
3,RAW SOUND!,"This is HEAVYSHIFT on an earlier outing and it is truly AWESOME!! While you may only be into the newer stuff this is where it began,LOUD,PROUD-FUNKED-UP-JAZZ'N.A VERY TOP ALBUM-OH YEAH BABY!! A TRUE BELTER!!!"
5,Australian nurse' reflection on a valuable text.,As I read Suzanne Gordon's account of nurses in todays world of cost cutting health care I could not help but admire her insight. While she is primarily a journalist her observations are so much of that of the nurse clinician trying to be there for the patient. Situation at my work place is identical to that of most hospitals Suzanne speaks of. This book is in the library at the university of which I am a graduate student. As an experienced nurse I would like to urge nurses entering the profession to read this volume and take heed before it is too late to make a difference.Susan BardyAdelaideSouth Australia
2,Waste of Money,"Unfortunately, Gordon, who is promoted by some as a champion of professional nursing, loses credibility through her obvious significant bias towards unionization of nurses and a national health system. These two ""solutions"" are presented as the answer to century-old challenges in heath care. Other countries with national health systems have the same if not greater issues with nurse-physician-administrator dynamics. Unionization solves no problems and in fact, inflames them - look to California for good examples. True nursing leaders like Tim Porter O'Grady are discredited by Gordon for supporting transition of RNs into higher level leadership roles in care coordination and health promotion. Interesting anecdotes are presented, but no real solutions."
1,Not his best writing,"After having read several of Scott's books, I was greatly disappointed with this one. There are so many quotes from too many people that the storyline gets lost in the process. In addition, the pages upon pages of interviews with murderer John Annible are scripted verbatum, instead of being summarized. This made the reading process even more tedious. Scott usually puts out good text. He was way off on this one."
2,zen,The book is very short and too personal and at times appears to be a plug for the author's other books and his rehab program.
3,great book,This is a great book and an easy read. It does give you plenty to think about and put into action.
5,Learn how to REALLY pray!,"The book expands upon ""The Lord's Prayer"" and gives us great understanding into ""fleshing-out"" the outline given in Matthew 6:9-13. Breaking it up into six parts, Dr. L. Lea examines and expands it and associates it to six ""laps"" of an indoor jogging track (and calls the parts 'demarcations'). The examples and short illustrative stories add much richness to the presentation.All in all, it was a highly iformative and enjoyable read. I am currently re-reading the book and gleaning more out of it than I thought possible.Anyone wishing to enhance their prayer life should have this in their library, it will be a regular 'friend.'"
1,Excrement,This is a positively terrible book. The artwork is by no means up to the standards of the first three books. I would not waste my money!
3,plenty of questions.,"all it has in it are questions, and answers no material to go over, I ended renting a booking from the library will let you know if it helps."
3,Many good examples for practice,I liked the book because you did not need to be an advanced programmer to use it. Everything was step by step and easy to follow. My only problem with the book were the occasional errors in the scripts. In a way this helped me because it made me problem solve myself.
2,Dissapointing figure for an awesome character,"Jazz was my favorite character in the movie. Unfortunitly, it seems the fate of his toy is on par with his fate in the 2007 movie. This sculpt makes Jazz look fat and dumpy. His ""hands"" are half-inch spikes of plastic that do nothing but fold out. On mine, the head would not fully pop out. The fold-down wheels at the feet just look silly. His telescoping sword is a cheap cop-out for a weapon, along with his spoiler supposedly doubling as a shield. The grey plastic looks horribly dull. Jazz is suppose to be about style and cool, not dull. Vehicle mode looks ok. I would pass on this guy."
5,a must get,"i was a little under excited about getting a dead robot p.s. he dies in the first movie, but he definitely transforms well and the planning for that was great i like how it all transforms. the only thing i didn't like at first was the hood, and shoulder joints i was hesitant because i thought i would break them, but it all opens up very nicely, and i love his gun/ sword, mechalive isn't very extensive but nifty for a last step transformation."
3,hard to open,"This was a Christmas present for my grandson. His mother said it was too hard for her to open, so she had her daughter open it for her brother. He's 5 and she's 12."
5,This book has it all!,"It is a powerful story that takes you through a series of poignant, unpredictable changes...overpowering emotions to a maddening fear and blind aversion. It's about rising from the depths of despair and hopelessness, to soar in triumph. I found it impossible to put this book down.I was glued to my seat from the first page until the very last one. I am looking forward to reading Patricia Lynndail's next novel!"
5,Excellent Dictionary!,"This is an exceptional book for new students of the Russian language, and for those who are already profficient in it, and just need a little help once in a while to find that one specific verb.Well put together, includes common verbs with all-encomassing usage examples, as well as less common yet very important verbs.A must for any student, teacher and interpreter of the Russian language.Highly recommend!"
3,Not enough of a heart shape,"I ordered these as a christmas gift for my mom because she loves hoop earrings. They look well made as hoops, but they barely look like hearts at all, if you want something that will stand out these are not it. They are a very subtle heart, too subtle for me."
1,Horrible Media Player,"I bought this Gameshark disk for the Media Player in hopes of playing MP3's on my PS2. After numerous attempts with each attempt ending in the Media Player just freezing up I finally gave up. I haven't looked at the other things on the disk, but as far as the Media Player, don't waste your money, it is junk. If it were possible I would give this product no stars based on the Media Player, but then I haven't looked at the other stuff on the disk."
4,Great for the Intermediate Spanish Speaker!,"If you already have a basic knowledge of Spanish then this will be of great use to you if you want to make the step up to Business level conversation. The cd and accompanying book is pretty comprehensive and if you don't have too much time to devote to a proper classroom setting, then this is a good idea as you can play the cd in the car while you are commuting or at home while you are doing the household chores and you can always go back to the book as a guide to see that you are on track. This is probably the next best thing to having an actual teacher by your side."
4,We all have to grow,"1961-1990: A Complete Career Anthology~ Del Shannon . There have been complaints concerning Del's career that were based on this compilation. Rather than stay stagnant, a la Chubby Checker, etc., Del experienced periods of growth and change. Instead of the teenage screamer of yesterday, the series ends with the gentle screamer of the later years. I found the later years, under the leadership of Tom Petty and other greats to be inspiring and interesting in the growth of a major representative of rock 'n' roll, whereas, some listeners preferred that he remain with the old and not venture into the new.That was the negative reaction that Ricky Nelson experienced in his advancement through the music genres and so it was with Del. I think that all of these pieces are necessary to experience the whole of the sound of Del Shannon."
2,Fell apart in under two weeks!,"The design has flaws. The tripod base was constantly unsteady, the whole thing lasted two weeks before one of the legs snapped."
1,Terrible Product!,"Full of cracks up and down the pole with one very large, structurally damaging crack at the bottom!!! You get what you pay for, I guess :-("
1,Broke on a whim,"I recently ordered this coat rack as a gift for a friend. The base surrounding one of the piece's feet broke shortly thereafter under very little stress. I've asked the supplier for a replacement piece, but the fact remains that THIS rack was not made of very solid materials. Otherwise it would have been an acceptable piece of furniture - nothing fancy - and a fair value for its price."
3,Nice while it lasts,"I have to admit I wasn't expecting much out of this rack. I only paid like $15 for it, I read reviews saying it was really cheap but it would be okay if you had some nails & wood glue to secure the feet better. It was great for about 4 months, then my roommate's 3 year old started playing with it, running past it knocking it down, and one of the feet came off. I used some wood glue & reattached it, and it held for a few more months, until finally 2 of the feet broke off, and the wood between them also came off.If you have some wood glue & nails, and no small kids, go ahead and buy this rack. If you've got kids, find a sturdier one, or better yet one that nails to the wall out of their reach."
3,Weigh the good and the bad..,"For the price this is amazing.. but there is many imperfections and peelings.. But like I said for the price, it's super sturdy and attractive.. if you fix or paint it.. which is what I planned to do when I picked it up for a bargain .. spray it for my childrens themed room :)"
1,Fell apart in the first week!,"I bought 2 of these, one for home, one for my husband's office. If you're hanging 2 suit jackets on it and nothing else, this is fine. For a family, not so much. One coat on each hook made 2 of the legs crack off. I got out the drill and drove some wood screws in, as a last ditch effort to salvage it, but the whole bottom fell apart again today. Sure it's $15 and has a nice wood look to it... But I wish I had read the other reviews first. DO NOT BUY!"
2,Don't Buy.,"Seemed fine at first. It was easy enough to assemble, however after two weeks or so the groove one of the 3 legs set in split under the weight of my coats (maybe 30lbs) and broke off. I tried and retried gluing, nailing, even duck-taping it to try keeping this thing together and standing. Nothing worked, so now its useless! Don't waste your money..."
2,Changes and Errors,"There are some gross errors in this book (especially in the artwork) that make me wonder as to the real accomplishments and attainments of the authors. The errors are such that I don't believe them to be intentional blinds. The Cicero's have removed nearly all traces of the Judeao-Christian Masonic themes from the Golden Dawn and have emphasized the Egyptian and Neo-Pagan. In doing so, key mystical truths have been omitted.I suggest using this book as a tool in combination with Regardie's version.The Cicero's book on Temple tools is very good however ""Secrets of a Golden Dawn Temple"""
1,Get Smart (1965 - 1970 Television Series),"A real BUST PLEASE Realize, this is a CD not DVD, Don adam's timing and delivery were one in the same...it really falls short without the visual. This rater makes you pick at least on star. I would buy the Get Smart DVD collection at the drop of a hat, this I would give no stars, I am sure it is posted with the DVD's so people like my self that are excited about finding another little gem will buy it before reading the fine print."
1,Had to be self published,Soprano's voice is shrill. Songs are atonal at best. I like a tune now and then. Even Barber couldn't save this CD.
3,O.K.,"The Product works very well. The construction does not SEEM strong, but does work well. Have not had a problem yet, and for the price range off the item I would recommend it. The hardware also could be a little stronger for the rail. I striped on of the nuts installing the rail. Easily fixable problem, and has worked fine down one screw."
3,You get what you pay for,"First of all, it does the trick - it works. It's cheap, it doesn't come with a remote. There is almost no application other than the one supplied with the product that will work with the device. The recording/pause features would have been nice had they been in a resolution that you could watch the recorded/paused content - I wouldn't use this device to record your favorite show - unless you're not planning on watching it.All in all, if you're looking for a cheap way to turn your laptop/old computer into a tv - it will do the job. if you're looking to make a ""vcr"" out of it - it's not the product for you.hope this helps."
5,Excellent device !,"I have it installed in a Dell portable pc (Inspiron 5100)Easy installation, almost plugn and play. Excellent signal even with a very simple antenna. Highly recomended."
3,Damned Good!,"I recommend that you read this book first before you read the Changing Land-which also features the adventures of Dilvish.The is a very uneven book, no doubt because it is a collection of short stories and fill-in chapters ranging from 1967 to 1982. Still, it has its moments particularly in the two longest chapters, Tower of Ice and Devil and the Dancer. Here, Zelazny was at full power, and I whipped through the book, which had been slow going up to that point. Dilvish is best enjoyed like Conan or Elric-- not for literary style or depth, but for sheer action, adventure and imagination. Of course, I came to like Black, the metal horse from Hell, best of all. He reminds me of Spock in a way. I usually end up saying that a Zelazny book leaves me wanting more, and that was the case this time. Luckily there is more-- The Changing Land."
4,Works as advertised.,"I wanted a simple shutter release, and I got it. Not as nice as the $200 one with the electronic timer, but at least you don't hae to hold the switch down in bulb mode on the 40D.You do, however, need to release it!Nice that it has a long (110""), flexible line.Other than that, nothing particularly striking about the product.:)"
5,"Good product, good price, prompt delivery","I bought this remote shutter switch for use with a Canon 50D. I don't have much to say other than that it does exactly what it's supposed to, was sent quickly (I got it two days after I ordered it) by Amazon's third-party vendor (Satechi), has a nice long cord, and is much better priced than Canon's unit. None of the remote switches I've looked at seem built to outlast rocks of ages or even my camera, but I don't worry about tossing this one in my camera bag for fear it will break when I drop a battery on top of it. A good product at a good price delivered quickly - what more can one ask?"
1,Happy meal toys have better quality,"Most of you are experienced with McDonald's plastic toys in the kids happy-meal. They usually work for a few days and then break.This product though, doesn't even work from the start. But otherwise the functionality of this product makes me directly think of the happy-meal toys.I am quite a tech person, so I doubt it is me that can't make this product to actually fire as it should in bulb mode (i.e. keeping the shutter open for as long as you hold the button down). If you don't need the bulb mode, it works (i.e. it can fire off a shot in A,CA,P,Tv,Av modes)....but then you don't need this product in the first place (use the timer).I will now take my plier and cut the 2' cable from the button-part and use it as my new shoe laces."
5,Excellent Product,"It's an excellent product, convenient for storage after backing, and easy to clean. Good for meatloaf fan."
1,not what I expected,"I thought I was ordering pilates exercise balls, but these are mainly used for back pain relief. They are virtually useless to me."
1,"Beware of Headliner, no balls come with this order","The balls work great if you can find them. Beware of this sellers false headliner,""The Miracle Ball Method: Relieve Your Pain, Reshape Your Body, Reduce Your Stress [2 Miracle Balls Included] [Paperback]""NO BALLS come with this order and then your are stuck with a book that is not worth sending back."
2,"Nice concept, but it stops there....","I got this after the reading some of the great reviews. Unfortunately, it didn't do any good to myself. Perhaps the biggest issue is the poor description of the excercises. Also the tiny size of the book makes it awkward to hold in your hand while on the balls trying to breathe and relax as instructed in it. Since breathing and relaxing are key components of the whole method, I found it a difficult task that someone could actually completely let go and relax on the balls while holding the book and your head up to actually be able to read the instructions.After a few tries with no success, I finally gave up. Now my ""miracle"" method is gathering dust in my covers."
5,Yes! I found something that really helps.,"My doctor suggested that I purchase the Miracle Ball. I have struggled with back and neck pain for over ten years. It' not a cure, but so beneficial to relax the pain away for awhile. It's great to use in the car for my neck."
5,nice,the balls are really a miracle..they have been a great asset to me... my back has never felt so good....thank you
4,Good Product,"I like these balls, but as someone elses review states it takes time for the balls to work. The balls DO work, but you have got to sit on the balls for a while and let ""gravity"" set in for the balls to truly do their job. If you can set aside I would say at least about an hour per day to lie on the balls then it would be worth it, if not then you may need to find another method."
3,Balls are different sizes,"The balls arrived in new packaging, but one ball was less inflated than the other. I don't want to use them together since they aren't in balance. I've been trying to re-inflate the smaller ball but can't figure out how to do it and there aren't instructions on Elaine's site. That being said, I use the exercises for one ball and love the results."
2,Not so sure....,"I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I can't seem to get the hand of using these things! I gave it a couple of trys and they actually made my back pain worse. Oh well, live and learn."
3,I don't think my Mom could use these,"I fit and healthy for the most part but have occasional hip/lower back onset arthritis flare-ups. I don't use them regularly and haven't actually used them during a flare-up so I cannot determine how helpful they will be at that time. When I do use them I find that they put too much pressure on my nerves and causes some numbing--maybe I don't have them placed properly?I think these balls would be a bit too hard, large and awkward to place under the arch of the back for someone older or heavy who can't arch their back very well.In summary, I would prefer to do yoga (flow) on a regular basis and when I have a flare-up, alternate with heat and ice pads under the arch of my back while doing subtle movements. If I feel the need to put something larger under my back and roll, I will use my rolled-up yoga mat."
3,Not quite a miracle,"The ""un-exercise"" approach to alleviating pain and reduce stress. Anytime you deepen your breathing, focus on a specific joint or movement you are going to alleviate or reduce some of your stress, so from that perspective the method is effective. Using the two balls to focus your movement is not bad, there is certainly no danger of injury; but I have not realized change in my posture or my flexibility. I do not have chronic back pain, so someone else with higher levels of physical pain might have a more dramatic impact but this product didn't help me much."
2,Miracle Balls,"did not work for me , i have back trouble and i cannot get down on the floor , no work for me"
5,Best single-CD collection of Hot Fives & Hot Sevens,"If you don't want to spring for a pricey box set, or your interest only goes as deep as the most essential sides, this is the best single-disc collection of the 1920's Hot Five and Hot Seven material. The most famous recordings are here - ""Heebie Jeebies"" (the first ""scat"" recording), ""West End Blues"", etc. - and the sound is fresh and spacious (the tracks are licensed from JSP, whose audio restoration of this material is unparalleled). Indescribably important music in a nice package. Should be in every collection of American music."
1,These are not real movies,"Nine movies all in one pack, packaged by a cheap DVD company. They are not worth the time or money, and since so few amazon reviewers write reviews of them, these films have a non existent audience."
4,"Informative, must read for those of us who love lighthouses.","Some people, myself included, love lightouses. This book should be an essenial part of our library. Not only does the authors give background info on history of the lighthouses in this book but also alerts the reader of nearby attractions and gives directions for those who like to see lighthouses. Perhaps one of the best things I like about this book is the pictures. They're beautiful. The book itself serves as a reference guide for lighthouse lovers everywhere."
5,as a gift idea,Gave this book to my fiancee' as a gift. She and her mother love it. It helps them with their vintage show. I would highly recommend it.
5,Great dress up,Its nice that it comes with the scrubs as well. Runs a bit small I thought. My 6 year old loves it.
4,A 300 page newspaper article,"I give the book 3.5 stars. The writing is pedestrian. Bland death scenes (and these are victims who were bludgeonedz; and/or shot; and/or chopped into bits.) Still, the reporting is objective and the overall story is interesting enough to where I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in 'cult' crimes."
2,This music requires an almost supernatural technique...,"Composer Godowsky has beautifully augmented the Etudes of Chopin, adding textures and even extra melody lines, with just two hands expected to somehow play it all. Carlo Grante is a very good pianist, but this music requires amazing dexterity. This is a noble attempt, but too often Grante is forced to break the rhythm and fluidity of the pieces in order to accomodate the extra material. Many of the pieces are simply played too slowly. Imagine Chopin etudes plodding like dinosaurs, like someone's got a thumb on the record! Marc-Andre Hamelin has the supernatural technique to play these pieces well. Grante plays some of the studies well enough. It's interesting to hear him attempt some of the most complex pieces ever written. But perhaps he needs another few years of practice. Someone wrote that Grante has re-recorded these pieces for release this year. It should be VERY interesting to see what eight extra years of practice has yielded!"
1,Nonsense.,"Grante has no idea at all of style appropriate to this idiom. Most of these are unrecognizable. No sense of texture, tone, legato, or anything else that would have meant anything to Godowsky. Check out Godowsky's American records, e.g. the Berceuse, (not the Columbias) to hear what I mean. As bad as I've heard since Szidon's hysterical Scriabin or Pollini's brutal Chopin. No bueno. Really no stars at all."
2,Difficult to confirm validity,"While interesting, it is difficult to prove the validity of the authors approach. I would recommend sticking to more traditional means of stock market analysis, i.e. Fundamentals or technicals or a combination of both."
4,Ronnie Raygun,"I was in my late teens and early twenties when Ronald Reagan was in power and despite liking him, he scared me, as he seemed out of touch with reality sometimes. I think Ronald Reagan was a genuine nice guy and overall a good President, but in the mid 1980's, I was resigned to the fact, that it was more likely that I was going to die in a Nuclear War, then in my own bed. This is a excellent documentary about Ronald Reagan from the cradle to the grave - warts and all."
1,Save your money.,"What a waste of money! Poorly recorded, terrible acoustics, a mixed selection of pieces but mostly a collection of noise, what more can I say. If I could give it less than one star I would. Save your money."
3,Warning - Fiction !,"There are several very good to excellent non-fiction books about this subject. Why read a made-up story, when the reality is just as interesting and more important to know? I suggest instead, ""The Stones Cry Out"", ""Cambodian Witness"", ""Year Zero"" and ""First They Killed My Father"".Here are excerpts from the 'prolog':""This book was inspired by the true story. . .numerous incidents have been embellished or invented. . .It is not intended that . . .all incidents depicted herein should be regarded as having actually occured."""
4,Nice book,"This is a nice book if you are interested in Schwinn bikes. Being new to the hobby, we wanted to read as much about Schwinn bikes as we could. There seems to be plenty of information on most of the models and variations. Lots of photos, but I kept asking myself why they weren't in color. That would have earned a 5-star review. A good addition to the bike library nonetheless."
4,Great for self instruction,"I have found this text excellent. We are a group of scientists (from several different fields) who used this text to teach ourselves the fundamentals of multivariate statistics. The Matlab scripts were essential in showing us how to perform some of these difficult computations correctly. The use of a simple data set example throughout the text (using 15 midges) was helpful. The theory chapters are difficult, and it helped that one of us is a mathematician. In the end, we have been able to understand and apply some of these tools well. In my opinion, some of the other standard textbooks, such as Johnson and Wichern, are less appealing in several of these respects."
4,ALPHA 3,"SFA3 is good. It has great graphics, it doesn't take forever to load, and theres lots of extra things and choices you can do and lots of characters. It is very hard but it's still a fun game! Get it, It's worth endless hours of fun."
5,Favorite Game,I've owned this game for over a year now and I have yet to get tired. Learning the characters and different abilities and finding the new characters is always a challenge. It's also quicker than your normal Street Fighter Game.
4,Pretty good,"I like the story of this book, but my son (who is 1) always just wants to skip to the end for the pop-up Elmo. I'm afraid he's going to rip it before long. It's a cute book."
5,Wonderful Elmo book,"My daughter LOVES Elmo and I was excited to find this book for her for C-mas. She thought the Elmo pop-up was the greatest thing she ever saw. She laughed and smiled and hugged and kissed him. We took this with us on a plane trip and it helped her settle down since she could not get down and play on the floor. The content is good for this age and now when we get to the page about the things Elmo says, she will repeat me. And she will point to the other things Elmo does on the other pages. She's almost 10 months and we let her pick out her own bedtime stories and it's almost always this book, or one of Roger Priddy's book. I higly recommend this book -- it was way too cute and babies love it!"
5,the only book my baby boy hands to me to read to him,My baby is 14 months old and will hand this book to us several times in a row to read to him - he doesn't do that with any other book he owns
1,I want 1.98 cents back !!!,"Just finished watching this film.... EPIC FAAAAIILLLLL !!! Acting was pretty terrible, plot was a joke.Not scared in the least, sadly made in 2006 ...horror movies from the 80's are way better than this garbage!!"
5,Saved a bunch on Kindle version,"Would be great if cheaper versions of most text books were available to college., This version just as good a physical version."
5,Hi. I'm Mat - door mat.,"Came in quick. Both receipients who they were purchased for loved it (both named Matt). Everyone who saw it got a kick out of it. Great, funny gift and good quality."
3,pathetic alright,"Very few really enjoyable stories in here. Sadly, people are just so self absorbed as teenagers that it was hard to be sympathetic with them"
5,SO FUNNY!,"I read this book over and over, laughing out loud the whole time! Then opted to pass it along to friends. I could not get enough of it! It brought back so many of my adolescent horror stories that created hours of conversation with my husband! Buy a few copies so that you can keep yours and give one to others 'cause you will want to!"
4,Mortified,"I enjoyed this book although I wish there were more information or background from the ""adult me says"" section. I guarantee you though, one of these snippets of high school-you will be able to relate to quite humorously. I also wish they printed the original letters instead of typing it out. Would have been better."
3,Not as interesting as it sounds,"This book's short vignettes of childhood embarrassment are pretty tame for the most part. There are a couple that will make you laugh out loud, but most will leave you saying ""Yeah, so?"""
2,Um....,"I got Good Cat! today in the mail and was surprised to find that it is 13% alcohol!! That's as much as a glass of wine! No wonder it claims to make ""finicky"" cats happy. It gets them tipsy! Honestly, I'm a little scared to give it to my cat..."
5,Don't judge it by the cover!,"Loved all 3 stories! Each time I thought I probably wouldn't get in to the next story as much, she proved me wrong and made me care about each new couple as much as the last. She wrapped it up with a good ending where all 3 are mentioned again, and feel mostly complete- I hate it when they leave you guessing. I read Bared to You first, which led to reading Seven Years to Sin, which led me to this book. I have to say, I haven't been disappointed yet! Can't wait to read more of her work. I was hesitant because of the title and cover art (which I personally find a little cheesy)but all three stories held my attention. If you liked Seven Years to Sin, you will like this book too."
1,piece of junk,"Bought this knife for my son for Christmas. It broke at the handle. What a shame. I have always thought Buck Knives were the best. I hate to admit it, but my cheap, Chinese made Winchester knife is much more durable. For the money I paid this is a discrase. I could return it for a new one, but I don't see the point. The broken blade looks like it was glued into the handle. I have owned a Buck folding knife for years, and I'll give credit where credit is due. They have made some great knives, but this is not one of them. So disapointed. What a shame!"
1,incredable JUNK!!!!!,"After owning this knife for about a year the hanle broke off this cheeseball piece of Buck trash! I paid alot for this unit just to have it break on me ,and if you repair there knife so you can use it that voids the Buck warranty, it costs Buck almost nothing to produce this cheeseball pile of drivle, up yours Buck,I would not take this with me into the woods or steelhead fishing, you want a knife you can depend on and buck is not it!! That is the first and last buck I will ever own or purchase, I have a cheap survival knife from China that I paid $8 for and it has really held up with no problems whatsoever and it holds an edge very well for what I paid for the CHEESEBALL buck trash knife I could buy six survival knives that would last several lifetimes, BUCK SUCKS, lets repeat that BUCK SUCKS, this is the worst company I have ever dealt with bad warranty extremely bad products, and you still suck the big one Buck!!!!"
4,A good place to start.,"Trying to find good information about the uniforms worn during the Mexican Adventure has never been easy, and some of the information in this very book can be argued as incorrect. Nevertheless, good color plates of the uniforms involved are too hard to find, and anyone interested in the Mexican Adventure should pick this book up. The book also provides an excellent overview of the events and history behind one of the most historically neglected colonial conflicts of the nineteenth century."
4,As good as the rest of the series (that's good!),"**NOTE, this review is based on the downloadable demo through X-Box Live Marketplace**I downloaded the demo and played it through and the first thing I noticed was the controls were not as responsive as the past PS2 versions. The controls seem loose and a little choppy. I'm hoping that they cleaned it up in the retail version of the game, but I think probably not. Everything else is great as expected from the Tenchu series. Customizing your character is a welcome addition to the game and although I haven't tried it yet, I'm guessing online co-op will be amazingly fun. So although I have only played the demo I'll have to use Ockam's Razor to predict that the rest of the game will be just as fun. 4 stars because of the loose controls for movement and non-stealthy fighting."
4,a must have for any big Yeah Yeah Yeahs fan,"This book covers the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and their adventures whilst touring around the world. It shows you the difference between fans in every country, and not only that but many more interesting pictures."
1,Nunca escuche un cd tan malo como este,"Ahora entiendo porque fue en Espana donde lanzo este cd, porque parece Camilo Sesto cantando. Me parece un cd tan malo que apenas lo oi lo devolvi al dia siguiente. Un trabajo que no parece echo por el. Echo sin ganas como obligado a tener que sacar un cd y cumplir con un contrato. Decadente y horrible !!!!!"
3,What do people see in him?,"I bought this CD after listening to ""Sol, Arena, Y Mar"". I like the song and also ""Tu Mirada"". But this is not the best Latin CD available. You have a real masterpice in ""Me Estoy Enamorando"" by Alejandro Fernandez (a better singer too), and other options on Christian Castro and Chayanne. Luis Miguel came out in the days where he was truly ""El Rey"", since he lacked competition, so he became an icon. But time has passed, and I only see in Luis Miguel a guy who give orders on how he wants the dishes, where he is going to eat washed!. This is just ridiculous!. He does it where ever he goes!. Talk about an ego!. I gave this CD two stars for the two songs, and the third star because I am in a good mood. Just wait until the ""Me Estoy Enamorando"" follow-up is released...which will be soon."
3,I expected a great album.,"This is a disappointing, uninspiring and blase rendition of Luis Miguel's talent. With two exceptions, there is little of his creative and talented compositions. His same-same orchestra drowns him out and he really should lose his percussionist. Go out there and find a new sound and get away from the orchestral arrangements. It is really a waste of his prodigious talent and such a shame. For me the real Luis Miguel with his incomparable love lyrics is Todo es Igual with beautiful love renditions sung with feeling, also there is a variation in his musical backgrounds. His wonderful classic renditions of oldies but goodies and an outstanding orchestral background remain his Romances and Segundo Romance. He needs to re-invent himself and really tap his potential - jaded perhaps with his financial success and love-life. Perhaps. Que Lastima, Luis Miguel - Superate, lo vales."
5,WOW!!! LUIS MIGUEL ERES EL MEJOR,"Luis Miguel demuestra una vez mas lo buena que es su musica. Este CD me dejo totalmente anonadada. Todo el CD es calidad 100% buena como todo lo que el hace. Felicidades LM nosotros tus fans, siempre estamos contigo. :)"
4,Growing Up Firstborn,"If you or the one you love was the firstborn son or daughter in your family, read this book. Otherwise read ""The Birth Order Book."" It is amazing how many things about our personalities seem to determined by the order in which we were born into the family.As I read this book, I was suprised at how well I was described in these pages as first born son. I have since also read the ""Birth Order Book"" and found it helpful as I sought to understand my siblings better. And both books are helpful now as I seek to be there for my boys."
5,Platnum series chrome nerf bars - 07 F150 Supercrew,"The bars fit perfectly and look great, I ordered a couple of other bars previous to these and they were on the short side. Very easy to install, a couple of type-o's in the instructions on bolt sizes, but nothing you can't figure out if you lay out the parts for each side. I haven't had them for winter time yet, but I heard other reviews saying that they won't rust. I'll have to see for myself. If they don't, it's definitely worth the extra money. I found the platnum series on Amazon for the same price as the signature series on other websites. I haven't seen any bad quality issues with the bars. Ordered with Ship Saver and still had the bars withing 2 days. Excellent price, excellent service."
2,Panasonis Cordless Reciprocating Saw,"I am very disappointed with this saw. I buy almost all my tools from amazon and try to research products in depth. This was supposed to be the best, I thought. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it comes in handy for very small projects or when you need to cut one or two items. For demo or large items I use my tiger saw (corded), it will smoke the Panasonic. I also purchased the panasonic cordless hammer drill, just as disapointed with it. I will stick with porter cable in the future."
4,Little-known New England Sea Serpent gets its story told.,"A detailed record of sightings of a sea serpent of the coast of New England. Easy to read, well-documented, and full of quotes from archival resources, a great introduction to this bit of Yankee lore."
1,No Book,"I ordered this ""book"" with CD based on the previous reviews. I received my shipment today with no book and just a CD in the box!The policies on the CD were of similar quality to those freely available in the web.Do not waste your money there are plenty of good policy resources out there and this is not one of them!"
3,Too much fluff,"This game is fun because it has the orginal Super Mario Bros in it. The nostalgia is there on the small Game Boy screen. The down part is the fluff, like images to print out. All this is a total waste of memory on the cartridge."
5,SMB Dx. totally awesome!!!!!,"i like this game because it has good graphics,lots of entertaining levels, and is very creative. it is definitely worth every last penny. i beat the original mode, and the Star Courses. if you get a score of 300,000 or more,you will unlockSMB for Super Players. I am on level 7-3 in that. HINTS & TIPS:on Map Screen, push Select to be LUIGI. if stuck on 7-4 or 4-4,you must go different routes otherwise it will keep repeating.try to find invisible blocks; they might be 1-UP mushrooms,YOSHIeggs(in CHALLENGE), vines, or get you up high.to unlock BOO races, get 100,000. there are various ways of getting lives. run over blocks only 1 space apart. BUY 2DAY!!!!! THIS GAME SURE BEATS POKEMON!!!!!"
2,This Game is very old!,This game is very old. You could buy it on the very old Nintendo system. It is not very fun and there are not many moves. I recommend you save your $$ and buy another game.
5,PERFECT!,"The graphics are cool.when i first bought it was bright,and lots of codes.theres no problem of keep playing the game because all the levels are long and cool.You could also play lots of bonus games,and make your own titles.theres even a calender."
2,Very Poor Excuse For Writing A Book--Who Cares About His Junk!,"I bought this book(cheaply thank goodness) thinking it would be an interesting memoir about selling on ebay. WRONG--it is nothing but photographs of the author's boring junk with small captions so we can all read the cutesy descriptions he wrote for ebay. About 60% of the items were purchased by his friends or people trying to help with this ""project"". Save your money--this is just pictures of dirty old clothes and canned food--not one interesting item--with very little commentary, most of which is self-conciously ""hip"" and cutesy.I'm really sorry I wasted my money, but you don't have to."
3,Substituting opinion for fact,"Mr. Harrison is probably a good mobile dj but he makes the mistake of assuming regional preferences (such as clients not wanting lighting) and that most weddings go 4 hours is true all over. More importantly, there are numerous occasions where he states his opinion as fact. If these were truly facts, there would be documentation to back them up. There is a lot of good advice in this book but it's mixed in with a lot of opinions and outdated information which the target audience would like have difficulty sifting through."
5,Exactly what I needed & a quick delivery.,It worked right out of the box. I had a burned out emachine computer with atleast 450 family pics on it sitting around for 4 years. I took the hard drive out connected it with the USB into my new laptop and there were all the pics (my wife was very pleased also). I also used it to connect an old Hp lap top that wouldn't go on. I used my current McAfee Virus scan on the drive and now the lap top works. It found 3-4 different trojan viruses cleaned them up and now the lap top works fine (I don't know if that was the problem but it works now). I used the recovery discs and now it's back to factory settings. Haven't used it for anything else yet.
1,did not work on my hitachi hard drive,"i was excited when i got this product b/c i had an essay i had to get off my hard drive to turn in tomorrow. i plugge din the power source to the wall, went to hook it onto the hard drive and there was no where to plug it. Maybe im an idiot but im pretty positive there is nowhere to plug it. My hard drive came out of an Acer notebook and was manufactured by Hitachi. but yes no lace to plug in power. Im currently looking for another time of adapter for the power with little luck"
1,VERY inaccurate!,"Having been involved in franchising, owned some of these franchises, and have friends and family that have either owned or been President of some of these franchises, I can honestly state you are totally inaccurate in your analysis! A good portion of these franchises have MANY failures, And never grow beyond 100 franchises. Do your research on the FRANCHISE, not the financials they purport to be accurate! If they have been in business 30 years and franchising for almost all of those years, why don't they have more units? It is because MANY franchisees have lost everything and gone out of business. They then Re-Franchise the territory, and charge a hefty fee. Remember: A press release that says they will open 250 units in the next 2 years will NEVER be followed up by one that tells you they didn't hit their goal. Research some of the Franchisee Only attorney sites and see who is listed as having been sued for failure to provide what was promised! You might be surprised!"
4,Very Good Source For Researching Franchise Opportunities,"As the President of Franchise Interviews, we have met and consulted with thousands of aspiring entrepreneurs looking to buy a franchise. Bonds is one source we recommend using to begin your search. The information is the book is very accurate and up to date."
5,Playing MonsterSeed,"I'm reviewing RPG, Adventure and Strategy games, this game is a mixture between Jade Cocoon and Final Fantasy 7.In this game you play the role of a character named Daniel,you're somebody called a Ruler,you can collect ""seeds"" and hatch and mix in ""solutions"" to make stronger monsters.This game was good because you can make your own monsters and carry as many as you want.It was also good because the game always has something good or bad happening.If they made it to where you cant get ""deformed"" monsters there would be a better variety of monsters.What would also make it better would be to make more ""seeds"".People who like Adveture,Drama,and making your own Monsters will like this game."
3,1/2 good,Ordered two.... one came broken with a small replacement piece needed...contacted RIO gearto get the replacement piece...which I was willing to PAY for.....got nowhere....way bigger hassle sending back to Amazon
4,"Pricey, But Worth It","This past summer, when my 3 year old daughter first developed a love of horses I bought her a few Schleich horses. By Christmas, horses turned into a mild obsession and the only thing she wanted from Santa was a stable.I looked at and researched many stables. This was the only one I felt comfortable buying. The construction is very good and extremely solid. It will last many years. Like I said, it's pricey, but worth it."
4,Blowing in the Wind - Will they return?,"Magnificent flute music to keep the cobwebs away, whether it is heard from the bustling kitchen or from the music room in a quiet moment. A pity it is no longer available."
3,You like this? Try McCartney' Fireman first 2 cds,"Not my favourite PT album, but a nice one if you need to relax and have a good ""climate"" time. Great to listen to in a room with lights down low. If you like this, you should try Paul McCartney's The Fireman albums, especially the one called RUSHES..."
5,For the eclectic listener,"Tired of the standard baroque; oversatiated with theme albums:'midnight favoritites"" etc. ; if so try Karl Jenkins and travel to a music space you've longed for but never visited for more than a few chords; vigorous yet sublime; martial yet peaceful and altogether beautiful. FPB ann arborMichigan USA"
5,Beautiful listening,Music to relax by. Music to cook by. All the same with THE ARMED MAN: A MASS FOR PEACE. I love the arrangement.
4,A Mass in the modern idiom,"This is a more homogeneous work than some of Karl Jenkins' other compositions but still it embraces a number of styles - as perhaps appropriate for a Mass which expresses such different sentiments. The second movement Call to Prayer by a Meuzzin is the movement that seemed to me not to fit into the work as a whole, though I understand the composer's desire to make the work as inclusive as possible, given its provenance. The fifth movement Sanctus is probably the best known and, as might be expected of a Mass, the Kyrie, Agnus Dei and Benedictus are the most reverent of the movements. Overall, this is a quite lovely and highly original work."
4,Interesting,"Like quite a lot of Karl Jenkins's work, this is somewhat derivative, with several passages recognisable from other composers' works. Despite that, however, it's very listenable (sic) and it's a good thing I have it on CD and not LP or it would be worn out by now."
4,Invisible Promise,"Richard Vahnil lives the good life with the perfect wife and near-perfect son. Emphasis on the top-of-the-line brand names for everything that touches their lives. He has everything a man could want, yet there seems to be something missing. This reader gets the impression what is missing is Richard Vahnil. The author gives an interesting picture of people whose focal point is having only the most expensive things in their homes, just so they can point them out as being there. Do they actually add to the enjoyment of living? This tale is enough to make you wonder. There seems to be a desperation lurking just beneath the veneer of the business and home life of Richard an Pam. They talk and share the same bed, but one has the impression they exist in two separate worlds without real communication. Invisible Promis consists of several subplots author Benjamin Prager successfully carries through to the end where things prove out - nothing is what it seems."
3,Grown-up Kid Toy,"I would like to say that this is second motorcycle toy I have bought from New Bright. And although the first cycle did sustain some damage from my 12 year old, I had decided to just put it up as a display instead of a toy to be played. Reason being, that without proper outrigger wheels to help maintain a vertical attitude on the cycle, the toy was bascally rendered useless except for the purpose of displaying it.The design and engineering that it took to build the toys, was absolutely wonderful. A great effort was taken to detail as well as looks.But again the toy is best used for displaying unless up dates on design are made.As mentioned before, I bought two units. One is Softtail Harley and the other is a Road King Harley."
2,Not a good Textbook at all,"I've used several astronomy textbooks for my classes and this is by far the worse. It doesn't explain concepts as well as other textbooks, the topics are scattered and it does not explain equations, or show how they are derived."
3,New but with marks,"The delivery was ok, but the book, selled as new, had a big mark on the side and the front cover was creased. Upon my request for explanation, the seller (after four days) agreed to either take the book back with full refund or to give me a 20% refund."
3,Vampire Viscount,"Vampire Viscount was an interesting book. I say interesting and not great because I was not able to immerse myself into the book. I was able to put it down and not worry too much about getting to that next page.I felt like the Author Karen Harbaugh could have spent more time developing the characters and the scenery, so that I could have become one with the story."
2,:(,"I bought this on a whim, and am glum. It is neither for adults, nor really for adolescents, it is neither about philosophy, nor really about scholarship or enligthenment. The stodgy-stereotypical mystical style doesnt help."
2,cheap but serve their purpose,"I purchased these for preschool co-op group to store individual student items (crayons, markers, scissors, glue, paper, etc) so each child had their own identical bag for class. They loved the bags BUT the zippers are cheap. The inside zippers came right off on the first zip :( for organizing what I need they are fine but I'd go with another bag in the future. Didn't attempt an exchange or return."
3,Middling approach to the Middle Pillar,"Pros:The ""Tree Walk"" visualization is brilliant; a really fresh way to approach the subject matter. It could be a play or a beautiful piece of performance art.Chic & Tabitha Cicero cover the bases on the requisite set of correspondences (names, angels, colors, concepts, precious metals, dieties, sitcoms and sportswear)Cons:The authors do not explain why someone would want to study the Kabbalah in the first place. There is, of course the posit that one will ""experience the divine"" but there is no further elaboration on what that is or what its supposed to feel like.The book is dated, showing its (new) age."
1,The content is about as thin as the paper it's printed on,"I have studied the Kabbalah for many years, and have read countless works of literature about this Divine path. Chic and Tabatha Cicero have written the most shamefully poor book that I have ever had the misfortune to read on the subject. This book is insultingly patronizing and very badly written, even by Llewellyn's standards. Their insights are so greatly lacking that I am forced to wonder just how competent the authors are on the subject. Moreover, their ""Tree Walk"" creation has all the depth and brilliance of a Saturday morning cartoon. Kabbalah is a Spiritual Path of Divine Enlightenment. This book not only shows little respect for this Sacred Path, it shows absolutely no respect for the reader who is being dealt with as if they were a 7 year old."
4,perfect match,Exactly what I was looking for and a great edition to my literature for teaching Deaf and Hard of hearing students.
3,A good story with some dark passages,While I only give this book a middle of the road rating I really liked it enough to order the next 2 in the series. This is the story of Lazar who is the exiled prince of Ascesion due to the coup that happened many years ago he is actually the last remaining member of his family. It is also the story of Allegra who is the daughter of the president who is put in power after the coup. Lazar is bent on revenge and part of the revenge is to kill Allegra before her father. But things take a huge turn of events when he saves her from her fiance and she can't believe it that she is rescued by a pirate especially one that looks like her fantasy prince. I didn't like how he treats her in parts of the book especially assuming that she will have no problems being his mistress etc... There is also a scene with some really evil drug lords etc... But overall a pretty good book!
2,"WARNING, INFERIOR BUILD QUALITY","I had a pair years ago, sounded great and built like a tank with Birch Plywood, Just got a pair and they are half the speaker they used to be, i.e. they still sound great, but they are built like crap using MDF and glue guns. Save your money and buy a speaker from a company that cares about build quality as much as they do sound. Also, dont buy the excuses that they use high quality MDF and it has tighter tolerances,better resins, blah-blah, crap material is crap material."
3,"Comfortable, but not good quality","I purchased two of these bras and after one wearing, one of them started to fall apart. The stitching came out. The bras are very comfortable, but where the stiching came out on the one, I cannot wear it at all now. The quality was disappointing."
2,Give me a break...,"Despite the fact that I thought the ideas were unusual, I found the reading rather dull and uninteresting. Nothing in the entire work kept me wanting to turn the pages.Harris seems to lack a distinct style all her own. It seems as though she borrows much from other writers, but not to the point that it's obvious, to her credit. For the most of it, I found this book no more entertainign than a campfire story, only without the frightening surprise ending.Having spent a great deal of my time growing up in Texas, I did not tend to much identify with any specific aspect of the work, as some critics have praised. It almost seemed mundane. Texas twists on others' styles do not, to me, constitute good works of literature. Perhaps a more colorful use of language could do Harris some good in future writings.But, to her further credit, her imagination does not seem to be a shortcoming. I expect more outlandish works from this author."
2,WanderLOST,"A lot of books seem to be taking the approach this one does in terms of writing - completing the whole story in the form of e-mail correspondence between the main characters. While it was a novel approach at first, it has started to wear thin and I kind of wish writers wouldn't use it so frequently. In nay case, this book lacks character depth because of how it is formatted (emails only) and it's hard to follow the thread of the story sometimes because of it. The central plot was a romance, a triangle romance, where the heroine is caught between 2 lovers. It wasn't a really good book and I wouldn't recommend it. The characters were not very interesting and the exploits of the main character were not as adventurous as the title and preview made it seem. I think the story would have actually worked much better if it had written in a traditional format."
4,Phenomenal bass work!,Awesome CD for Bassists to enjoy! I highly recommend this one as Steve Hunter uses nothing but the bass to make awesome music and well-crafted songs. Definite must for all bassists!
5,I think this is fun and easy to follow along. Great results ;-P,"Kimberly Spreen is fast becoming one of my favourite instructors. She knows her stuff and she's outgoing, encouraging and she cues well so that makes this fun to do.This is intense; it's hi/lo cardio and kickboxing too. The transitions from move to move are done well and so everything flows well. Your heart rate will be up the whole time and so you are pretty much guaranteed to be burning fat throughout. It's fun and it takes a lot of energy to get through this, but it's worth it. With all the kickboxing and large movements and the non-stop pace, you will be shedding weight quickly. At the end of the aerobic section you repeat all the moves in a 'let it all hang out' (as she says) series of moves. Then after that, there is regular lower body toning to finish off.She's a great instructor and encourages you in a friendly outgoing way, so it motivates you to stick to it. I'm glad I've got this workout in my collection."
1,this is junk don't buy it,"did not get what I was ordering even the picture is wrong.What was received was a 2 piece instead of 1 piece system. It is junk, it does not stay together or fit the ear well."
1,formulaic formalism,"The author appears to be terminally addicted toreams of calculation without much in the way ofmotivation. Take the section on celestial mechanics(please), which is one of the worst I have ever seen.He has page after page of relentless calculationswhich would leave the uninitiated reader utterlylost in this dense mess. Much more to the pointwould be an appropriate diagram to illustrate thishighly visual subject. Sadly, the author remainsstuck in his LH method of exposition and seems notto grasp when to bring in geometry to aid and abetthe raft of algebraic manipulations."
2,Hmmm,"It's too bad the item reviewed is given less stars than it deserves because the seller is of poor quality. (for the times I dont go in and read all the reviews...) wish there were two distinct star-oriented rating systems that appeared with each item listed in Amazon: 1) how you would rate this product AND 2) how you would rate this seller. anyway, thanks angela for the heads up on the seller!"
2,Clie Disappointment,"I was excited by the features on the PEG-TH55 when I bought it. No other device offered more for the price. But in less than a year, I have had two problems with it. First, the screen failed after three months, Sony said it must have dropped and charged over $100 to fix and return it, even though I'm sure it hadn't. Now the camera software doesn't work and I have to return it to Sony again, incurring more cost. To top it off I cannot setup the return online but must call to arrange it.Sorry but for me it's not worth the headache. My old Visor ran for years with no problems at all. Needless to say I won't be buying another Clie!"
1,10 Gauge or 10 AWG that is the question !,"I purchased this wire to supply my cerwin vega XLS 215 Dual 15"" 3-way speakers(500 watt max)when the wire arrived it was obvious that this was not 10 AWG(american wire gauge). I had some old radio shack Megacable that is 12 AWG and it was clearly thicker than this wire by about a third. So don't be fooled by the GAUGE rating of cheaper china made wires such as this .Make sure the wire is rated in AWG it will be about twice as thick as this wire rated in gauge. I had also tried the DB Link SW10G100Z 100 Feet 10 Gauge Speaker Wire with the same results. When I did find true 10 AWG wire the price was 100.00 for 100 foot roll so I went with GLS Audio Premium 12 Gauge 100 Feet Speaker Wire - True 12AWG Speaker Cable that is rated up to 600 watt for only 28.00"
2,Husband didn't like it,"I bought this for my husband to polish my car's headlights which are turning yellow. He said the fabric of the ball wasn't right for the job. It was taking him longer to polish the lights with this product than it took him to do it by hand. So now he uses the ball to clean my rims, but even then the ball is too big."
2,Time consuming projects!,"I love Volume 1 of this series. It has simple, easy to create products. This volume contains much more time intensive projects. Even my avid scrapbook buddies agree that this book is definately not as good as the first one."
1,A big waste of money,This had to be the biggest waste of money I ever spend on Amazon. No directions or instructions on how to play the games. The video quality isn't really that good and it's slow reacting to the keyboard. Into the wastebasket it goes.
3,Please don't buy untill you read this. . .!!,"First, these games are totally awesome! They are for the most part arcade perfect! Unfortunately, there's a down side. I bought this hoping it would run on my computor. It won't!! The game's freeze every few minutes! Digital leisure provides a download that's is supposed to fix the problem! It doesn't! My computor meets all specs for this game. And I'm running ""Windows XP"". Don't buy this version! Buy ""Dragon's Lair 20th Anniversary Edition DVD"". This version works perfectly! I tried contacting Digital Leisure and got no response. What a shame!!!"
1,Dearfoams need more quality control,Bought these slippers for my daughter and she loved them. Until the upper started separating from the sole. She only wore them 4 times before this happened ... so I returned them today and Amazon told me that they are no longer carrying that slipper. That's too bad -- Dearfoams should increase their quality control and tighten the stitching around the shoe so this doesn't happen again.
5,perfect !! good service.,All the compilation are perfect.I love all the track even I did heardsome of them but is good for the personal collection.
3,Book lacks important details,"This book has a lot of strong points, but the maps are poor and so are the driving directions. Basically I can't help thinking that the authors want to tantalize paddlers into coming to Costa Rica, but they do not want to empower them to put together their own trip. The other reviewer noted correctly above that one of the authors owns a rafting/kayaking tour company. Of course they don't want you to be able to put together your own trip."
2,Not fully developed.,"Although the format is indeed innovative; interspersing cartoon chapters with prose, neither type of chapter had enough substance to make it worth reading. The book had a very interesting premise (which made me buy it), but I was disappointed that it was so loosely tied together and undeveloped."
3,reduced quality,product quality has gone down recently. I have been buying these ribbons for several years but have had problems lately with reliability
5,Faster than expected!,This book was shipped earlier than expected which made me very happy. Delivered in excellent condition.
1,"not ""boyish man;"" should be ""boring man""","this can only be seen on a tv.saw him on comedy channel a few months ago, laughed myself silly!he talked about cookies cookies cookies, and it was a blast!he talked about school as a kid, and that was hilarous as well.everything he did was great.so i was eager to hear it again, and share it with friends.this was boring as could be. he used other comic's jokes, it seemed, too.i fell asleep about six times watching it, and i have a difficult time falling asleep,and it didn't have to do with eating turkey on thanksgiving, either.absolutely worthless video. boring as can be. i lost any excitement about this comic.can't understand how Last Comic Standing can stand and face the public after producing this video.waste of time. gonna see if i can return it to amazon."
1,Waste of Money,I watched Gary Gulman on Last Comic Standing and thought he was hilarious. My husband and I sat down to watch this with great expectations and then didn't laugh once during the entire show. The format or show or something just didn't work for him. My son says he saw the cookie routine on comedy central and it was much better. So something was off or else an hour is too long for him. I was very disappointed in this DVD.
2,Not Good at all. DO NOT BUY IT.,"The color is kind of right, but NOT what buyers might expect. It does not really look like aluminum.The texture is right, rubbery under the ""metallic"" fabric.The size of the mousepad is too small and it it does not work well with optical mouses. It makes the cursor ""jump"" or falter, it is not a good tracking surface.The wrist rest is the decent part of the deal, it works well and looks OK. But it is not special enough to justify the package's price.RAIN DESIGN IREST WRIST REST PAD SILVER (ACCESSORY)"
4,Loved it!,"Bought this game for my nieces to play, but the whole family ended up playing it with them. Sometimes you have to do karaoke and sometimes you have to do dance karaoke. It was hilarious...especially for the girls watching us dads and moms bust a move! It turns out this is a great family game!"
5,Productive Workplaces Revisited,This was one of the first books I've read on Organization Development. After reading a multitude of OD books since it is still the only one that I enjoyed and found useful information in an easy to use format from cover to cover. I still reference it today.
4,;0),Im so not into John Cena and i dont like his movies but this one was actually good i was loving the action and his acting isnt bad in this one.
1,Action packed but hard to enjoy,"It is the newest thing for hollywood directors to give you the moving camera action shot. To my knowledge the new James Bond Series does it most...and best. However there have been tons of other films that have attempted to emulate this technique and have failed..sadly 12 rounds is one of them. The moving camera is supposed to give the viewer the feeling of being in the action, or an actual by stander to it..and does work sometimes. The problem with 12 rounds is that there is barely a steady shot in the whole film. This film seems like it was directed by a first time director with no real concept of filming a movie. Instead of feeling like you are at the scene of the action, the busy camera is distracting and diminishes from what might have been a better film in the hands of a more competent director....and Mr. Cena..doesn't help..he's not the greatest lead...and needs better support in front of and behind the camera if he is going to shine."
2,Cheaply Made,"I have bought quite a few tongue rings from BodyCandy and they've all been great UNTIL I purchased this ""pink flexi whistle"". Horrible! The barbell had little to no flex and broke the day I received it. Save yourself the money and skip this one and buy a real Bioplast barbell offered by BodyCandy."
1,The title not is always in chord with the content,"Be careful the musicians, because this is not a book of musical harmony. But a book of ...religion. Warning to navigators, because the name swift to confusion!"
2,Does not fit,"It is advertized that if fits my Nokia 8801, but it is way too big, so beware of product!"
2,"If you like Koontz, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!","Being a longtime Dean Koontz fan, I was eagerly waiting for his next book to come out. I was completely disappointed after having read this book. I started the book and had a hard time really getting into it but wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt so I stuck with it. What started out as chapters of lengthy mediocre writing, turned into the worst plot I have ever encountered. Every time I thought I had figured it out, I said to myself, ""No, it can't be that, he wouldn't write something that predictable."" Well, I was wrong. It was predictable and boring and a huge disappointment. It was different from his normal style (much like From the Corner of His Eye which was a great book) but it did not live up to my expectations which turned out to be entirely too high. Maybe he'll get it with the next book? For his sake, and readers everywhere, I hope so."
4,Koontz at his almost best,This book had me enthralled in no time. A somewhat implausable story line is the only thing that keeps me from rating it 5 star. It is a very good read with sub plots that keep your interest going long after you should have gone to bed!!
2,lame,"OK, Mr. Koontz,Could you please write a book that is not about dogs and how they are proof of god's existence. This lame theme is more like preaching than entertainment. Leave your retarded religious beliefs out of your books and maybe your stories will be good again.Your novels used to be thriling page turners about survival...now they are just lame religious stories about god and dogs. What has happened to you, Mr. Koontz? Are you losing your mind?Have fun at church...and don't forget to donate another $1,000 to President Bush.I refuse to read any novel of yours that was written after '95 or so. That seems to be around the time that you became a kook."
2,I hear the school bell ringing.,"I typically buy Dean Koontz's new books without bothering to read the story summary, knowing that I'm in for a good, page turning read.This book started out wonderful. I was enjoying the characters and intrigued by the story's plot. About half way through the book, the story took a turn and I began to feel as though I were sitting in the lecture hall of Koontz Academy.I read his books for entertainment and a fun filled, exciting escape from the real world.This book turned into a lecture on the evil of Bio-Ethics. While Koontz has prompted me to learn more about Bio-Ethics and their agenda, this book was not a satisfying escape from reality.For true escape and great fun, I suggest Lightning or Watchers."
2,What has happened to the master storyteller?,"I have been a hardcore Koontz fan for over fifteen years, and I must say that it's tempting to give this book five stars simply because it was written by one of my favorite writers.The construction of the book was similar to ""From the Corner of His Eye."" There were several seemingly related subplots that Koontz attempts somewhat unsuccessfully to bring together.Some of the characters were reminiscent of other Koontz creations. The drug-crazed mother brings back memories of another drug-crazed mother in ""Intensity,"" and the wonderdog is back, bringing to mind the lovable Retriever in ""Watchers,"" who was much more believable than Ol' Yeller.Not a total disappointment; however, I long for the Koontz of ""Dragon Tears,"" ""Lightning,"" and Mr. Murder."" I want a novel, not a collection of short stories, which is how this book reads."
1,too long to be so dull!!,Uhhh I have a love/hate relationship with Dean Koontz and this book I hated. It was just over 600 pages and I think I enjoyed maybe the last 50 pages or so. The characters were unrelatable and I couldnt connect with anything or anyone in the book. For being such a long book I felt like there was little jolts of excitement but the amount of dullness surrounding it choked it out. The plot hops around between the different characters and you litterally have to wait til the book is almost over to understand how they connect and until then your kind of lost. What else can I say this book was just not for me
2,This one's kind of for the dogs,"This was a rather disappointing book from Koontz. I've read most of his books and have always enjoyed them. I found the characters in this book well written and interesting and it did keep me guessing as to where he was going with the plot. However once I got to the end and found out his destination I had a hard time not thinking I just read a 600 pages for this? I won't give away the ending for those who haven't yet read it, but I feel that though the outlook expressed in the ending is admirable it doesn't make for a very satisfying conclusion for a book of this length. If a sequel is in the offing, I sure hope he adds a few more twists."
2,Corny Dialog Dooms This Story From The Start,"I've read and ejoyed many of Dean Koontz books. This one, however seems to have been written by someone else. Koontz tries to make the characters of this story interesting by pouring on lots of colorful dialog. Unfortunately, the dialog is more corny than colorful. I listened to the audio version of this book and found myself turning it off time and time again. I just couldn't stand listening to the long-winded rants and multi-adjective descriptions that pepper much of the book. Koontz tries hard to make his characters ""hip"", but he does not succeed. One tip off to this is the unbelievably lame character names. Leilani Klonk?????? C&#65533;mon Dean... what were you thinking. I was very dissapointed in this offering from a writer who has proven he is capable of much, much better."
1,Major disappointment,"I have read EVERY one of Dean Koontz's novels and while I have taken exception with some he's written in the past few years, I've never been this disappointed before. His character development, as always, is outstanding but this is one of the worst stories he has ever come up with. Literally, almost nothing happens until you're almost 400 pages into this book and the action (what little there is) slowly (and predictably) begins to build. At 600 pages, this book is far too long and should have been 200 pages shorter. His descriptions of scenes, characters, and actions have become much too flowery and wordy and I often found myself saying ""Who cares?"" Keep it tighter next time, Dean."
2,Ugh! A labor to read and I'm a Koontz fan,"The book jumps chapter to chapter slowly describing the characters and does little to tie them together. I usually read Koontz's books so rapidly that I'm disappointed when they're over. This book has been a trudgingly slow and boorish read. In comparison to ""Ticktock"" or ""Watchers"" or a host of others, this one is a real sleeper. Sometimes I scan a chapter and see nothing, then go back to read it in detail and find the same. What a disappointment. Pick another one of Koontz's books. Not this one."
1,last chance,I love dean koontz but his work has been off a little bit butbeing such a loyal fan I thought I would give his work anothertry but with one step from heaven I must admit this will probably be my last book. This book was a big fat zereo from start to finish.The chacters were boring it has so many plots and so many boring under devloped charters in the book that i had to keep flipping back in the book just to rember who they were. and the end was a just nonsense. This book was just awfulit would have been a whole lot better if Dean would have went more into the mother life when she was young.And cut out a lot of the dog scences
2,Boring...plus,"Anyone who reads Koontz as I have read all, must think that he has lost it a bit..this book was without a doubt the most boring book he has written to date..I very much struggled trying to keep up and usually wound up falling asleep......save your time and go to Ludlums new book...much better"
2,Way too rambling.,"When Mr. Koontz is good, he is WAY GOOD! But here's another one with too much witty, wandering dialogue, way too many fabulous metaphors, and way too many pages. One of my favorite authors, Dean Koontz. But I'm skipping through this one just to get to the end. Instead of being able to savor each metaphorical gem and finely-tuned thought, they're all running together too closely. When you have a 16 cartons of chocolate, you begin to get sick of it."
1,Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z A Real Snooze,"A one star rating is too high for this book. Negative stars would be more like it. What would normally take me a week to read took me 5 and a half months of boring reading!! I'm a big fan of Koontz work and have read a bunch of his books. This book doesn't fit the Koontz style. It feels like it was written by someone else. I trudged through about half of this book, and put it down for about a month. I finally decided one day that it had to get better and picked it up again. It didn't get better. This is a lousy book with no real story. It starts bad, the middle is bad, it gets good about a hundred pages from the end and then the ending stinks. If Koontz was trying to make a social statement with this book he succeeded, if he was going for entertaining reading he completely missed the mark. I can't even say its ""not one of Koontz' better works"" because it's not even good enough to be classified as bad."
2,Long and boring,"Koontz has written a pretty good 250-300 page thriller, but unfortunately, it took him 600 pages to do it. Virtually nothing happens for the first 300 pages, and the book then picks up a little speed but still moves slowly, You almost get the feeling that Koontz is being paid by the word. That or he is trying to be ""artsy."" He goes into endless and tangential harangues on every person, object or animal that appears anywhere on the periphery of the book. The only way I could get through it was with lots of skimming."
2,"Different, not necessarily disappointing...","DK's latest wasn't disappointing, as much as it was different, in much the same way as From the Corner of His Eye. I enjoyed both these books, but nowhere near as much as some of his earlier thrillers. It seems Koontz is trying to explore different topics and genres as a writer, and his approach (IMHO), is still pretty flawed. I would love a return to the twisted, imaginative Koontz thriller days of old, but it seems with age, he's growing weary of that, and is testing his pen in other places. That's not a problem. Bob Dylan did the same thing, and so, it seems, is Stephen King. But I hope that Koontz can soon master this new direction, because I ... am already disillusioned and bored."
1,His worst by a long time fan,"This is Dean's worst book because he spends the most time preaching a silly new age Christianity based type belief (mixxed in with dog worship... I think he most not like cats or thinks we cat people most be perverted) while demonizing the ideas of others that don't come close to his. Of course all his characters agree with him, except the evil ones who he alludes are controlled by what I assume is the Devil. He does this while also making fun of New Age believers, people into health foods, and so on. Weird and hypocritical.The story becomes a vehicle to spew this nonsense while letting the story take a back seat. Those that agree with his selective logic and particular myths will enjoy the book. Those that don't will hope he gets back to telling stories or retiring before he ruins a career I have, up till recently, enjoyed."
1,A big let down after 600 + pages,I have been a big fan of Dean Koontz's books for over ten years and I nver thouhgt that I would rate a novel by Dean Koontz so poorly. The first book I read was Watchers. I thought it was fantastic!! After that I was hooked. To say that I was dissapointed in this book would be an understatement. It just didn't make much sense to me. As individuals the characters were not interesting. When they finally all came together they still were not interesting. Without giving too much away I will say that I can't buy the idea that the key to humankinds salvation and happiness can be found in a dog. When I usually read a Knootz novel I can't put it down. With this book I found it hard to mantain my interest and when I finished I thought IS THAT IT! AFTER OVER 6OO PAGES THIS IS HOW IT'S ENDS???????
1,Worst Porduct I've Ever Tried,"I just received this item today and headed straight to the tanning salon after work. I rubbed it all over my face and body before I realized that my whole face was on fire. I looked in the mirror and realized my whole body was red. I then ran to the bathroom and washed my face. I then threw on my cloths and ran home to shower this stuff off and cover myself in benadryl. I have never had an allergic reaction like this in my life. I never even got in the tanner, it was all from this lotion. I have been using another Satori Sol product at the salon and loved it. The one with cooling. This one has tingle, which I am apparently alleric too. Try a small packett (or don't) before you buy a whole bottle of this."
1,Where was it?,"Ordered Dec 7th, didn't arrive til Jan 8th 2009, as it was intended as a Christmas present, the service was extremely disappointing."
3,A little flimsy,"While I love caphalon, and only use capholon products I found this to be a bit flimsy. It tends to not stay aligned while in use. Ended up replacing with a different brand :("
5,Great Book for Anyone with a Singer Machine,I grew up sewing on my mother's Singer. I have since given her machine to my children. They both love to quilt. I bought this book from Amazon so they'd have something to help them. They really love using it.
1,Let's Keep It Real,"I haven't listened to this album since my freshman year of college (1999). I think I gave it away to someone. ""Whoa"" was the only tight track on the album, and the rest contains corny songs with corny beats and even cornier lyrics. I just had to drop a line because I saw the album had been so highly rated. Let's just keep it real....this album sucked."
4,"Bad Boy Rebirth, Part 1","I love eating my words. When Black Rob debuted on Puff Daddy's debut CD, I predicted he would be the first not to go gold or platinum, neither of his first couple of hits did it either, but with the long delayed release of ""Life Story"", Black Rob is definatley like ""Whoa!"". Unlike BIGGIE's ""Born Again"", this CD sounds like an actual Bad Boy album, complete with samples, cameos and the Madd Rapper. Standouts include ""Whoa!"", ""Muscle Game"", ""Jasmine"" and ""Life Story"". Puff's involvement was kept to a nimimum thankfully and his girlfriend didn't do as much damage as people think. By the way, all record labels have a down period, and name one arist on the roster who didn't go at least gold?(That was a trick question, there are none). True, the quality of Bad Boy releases has declined since the horrible Mase sophmore CD, but it happens. With Black Rob and newcommer Carl Thomas, Bad Boy may be picking up the pieces."
3,A little empowerring/A little insulting,"I'm on the fence about this one, there are times when I felt like putting it down and others when I just let go and soaked in the advice."
1,Not 100 ft only 70 ft,"I read the earlier reviews and was hoping that I would get lucky and get a full 100 ft of this wire. They really short you on the length. For what you receive I don't believe its worth the cost. I guess you get what you pay for. In this case NOT even close. I wish there was a way to contact the seller to let them know what a dis-service they are providing. The wire is great, The length is where they stick it to you. :o( Not happy."
1,Too Short!,"I bought this from E--y and ended up with the same problem, 90' 8"" almost 10 feetRaptor S14-100 100-Feet 14 Gauge Speaker Wire (Clear)short! When I received it the first thing I noticed ""Made in China"" that was a start. I immediately got out my tape measure and measured 90' 8"". What a pain! I don't care if it's metrics or whatever over there! If you market it for America, you make it to American specifications! If they don't or won't make it to American specs., don't buy it! I guess to answer another review of a review, I would say if it's to metric specs than it should be consistent reel to reel and it's not. The bottom line is when you're off 15' on one roll, 10' on another, 30' on another, etc... that's not right."
5,Versatile ring at a bargain price,"I try to avoid 10kt gold, but I got this on clearance for about sixty bucks so it was worth it as a trinket. Turns out to be much more high quality looking than I expected. The stones are all clear and bright. The variety of colors goes with so many outfits. And the size of the ring makes it striking without being horsey (I have smaller hands/shorter fingers so I have to be careful about that)."
3,looks like a fashion jewelery,"I agree with the opinion that this is a waste of gold. It looks like a fake fashion jewelery, and the design is cheap... Well, I only paid $60 for it."
2,It's ok but battery life is weak,"I bought this as a replacement to my Palm Tungsten C which has been returned for 3 replacement units and I've lost confidence with Palm.So far this Sony Clie is not as nice as the Tungsten C (when the Tungsten C works properly) and the battery life is much worse. I cannot go a weekend with moderate use (no WiFi) without recharging. WiFi makes it much worse. The recharging also takes much longer, 4+ hours if almost fully depleted.The Wifi setup is not nearly as intuitive as the Tungsten C. It also doesn't seem to work with my Netgear MR814 router while the Tungsten C had no issues with it.I like having a camera with me everywhere but I would easily give that up for more battery life and better WiFi support and intuitive WiFi configuration.I'll probably keep this until the next version(s) come out."
2,"Nothing new here; in fact, very little...","If you're a Van Damme fan, you've seen this stuff before. If you're not, it's best to just keep away. His earlier works, including the excellent ""Bloodsport,"" the timid ""Kickboxer,"" and the silly ""Death Warrant,"" all had the exact same elements this movie has. It's a by-the-numbers Van Damme flick that will probably interest only die-hard fans of his work. Director Sheldon Lettich and Van Damme have worked on another better film called, ""Double Impact."" See that one."
2,I didnt like it,"I think that the fight scenes were too slow and that the used a poor system to hide the blows. every time an actor gets hit it switches to another angle for a seacond. the only time this doesn't happen is the last fight scene because the big baddy knows his distance. the combat is slow and obvious. I give it two stars becuse van damn does show some unique athletisism in his moves. Not that doing the splits in mid air is useful in combat, but it is interesting."
4,he's the fastest fugitve and the best fighter.,"lionheart is a film which is mostly about family,when van-damme is in a french prison for drugs which he did not commit,he has to run away with a only six month sentance because his brother was burnt in a drug problem, when he escapes two french officers come to look for him in america where his other family is, when van-damme reaches america and meets his family he saw that they were in a very big money problem, van-damme decides to fight for money and becomes a trained fighter ,getting a lot of money after fight's and fight's he is nearly ready for his family to leave the bad neighbourd until the french officers are on his back. the last fight is amazing and the best scene in the film. In britain this film is called a.w.o.l which stands for absent without leave."
4,The Vandermark 4 take on Joe Harriott,"The premise of this disc is that Ken Vandermark figured out which Joe Harriott songs he liked the best, then recorded them with most of the Vandermark 5. Jeb Bishop plays trombone, Kent Kessler is on bass, and Tim Mulvenna plays drums. The songs are a mixture of straightforward and spacy. It's pretty good -- I rank it in the middle of Vandermark ouevre -- but not essential. I recommend it especially for Jeb Bishop fans. Without the knotty lines and rhythms of the average Vandermark 5 disc, Jeb Bishop has a chance to play in a more vocal and melodic style than usual."
2,Don't buy this if you are shopping for a diamond,"This book is an interesting read and it provides a lot of background industry information and makes veiled allussions to diamond smuggling and diamond trafficking and maybe this book would be helpful to someone who is buying rough diamonds on the black market in Zaire (I doubt that anyone doing this would need the tidbits of wisdom that this book has to offer, it all seems like pretty basic stuff), but if you are looking for a diamond for that special someone, this book is of almost no use to you.I bought this book thinking that it might contain a few tips on how I could buy diamonds at the insider price or maybe a few helpful hints on how to get a better deal or what sort of scams to look out for. I was wrong. Like I said -- an interesting read but ultimately not very useful."
4,An engaging journey through 30+ years,"Shostakovich's letters to Glikman show the personal side of the composer -- a man of humor, wit, intelligence, and an overall powerful mind. While keeping in mind his highly negative attitudes towards the Soviet government, the reader sees clearly Shostakovich's use of codified language, forms of reverse psychology, irony, parody, all of which he uses to keep the offical government censors off his (and Glikman's) back, and yet to deliver his true message, idea, opinion in a singularly and brilliantly effective way.My only reservation about the book is the one-sidedness of it. Glikman's letters, or simply more extensive commentary (although it is remarkably thorough, and an outstanding job for an old man 30 years later!). Shostakovich destroyed all the letters he received, so remedying this problem, alas, is virtually impossible.Highly, highly recommended despite this."
3,Not too bad.,"Castings are kinda rough and the oiling hole on top doesn't lead anywhere (must be the same casting used for a model with ball bearings), but for this price, it's hard to go wrong. I plan to use mine for low-speed non-precision applications on a CNC router I am building. Should work out just fine."
5,Useful Guide for all Honda Shadow 1100 owners,This is one the more comprehensive/technical books that I've read. Very useful if you intend to bring down the whole bike or just for the daily dose of maintenance needed to keep your bike in prime condition. Suitable for both beginners and experts. Even have parts codes so that you'll never get the wrong parts. It even has pictures and illustrations so that you'll not get lost. I think this book got more information than I need to handle my bike. It covers all VT1100s.
4,Pretty garnets,"These earrings are quite sturdy, and the contrast between the silver and gold gives them a spark. The garnets are a good size and a pretty wine color."
2,Payback is a mutha ?The thin line between reality and imagination,"This book was nothing special in my opinion ,the plot was ludacris and the end rushed.I like realistic books ,where the author knows how to blend reality with the most unrealistic situations, this book lacked of that.it touched issues such as drug dealing,hiv,greediness,cheating, however, the plot was not developed into something realistic and believable ,for thatI give it 2 stars ."
2,Not at all what I expected,"I was not satisfied with this book. Maybe it was because the Thugs and The Women who love them series was so good! I thought that the characters were so predicatble. We read about them and the same actions in every Urban Literature book. To me, and my circle of freinds who read just about every book that hits the shelf did not enjoy the read. However, I still think that Wahida Clark can write her behind off, and I know that I will still read all of her future books. It is hit and miss in life and this was a a 'miss'."
1,What happened Wahida??,"I read the book and at times I was confused on the story, dialect and following the author's lead.Wahilda was true to form with the drama - nice job, but the book seemed rushed for publication. Scenes and explanations of the story were a tossed presentation of events not necessarily in order.I enjoy Ms. Clarks's writings and although very disappointed with this book, I do plan to read her next book with hopes of a better book because she DOES have the talent.Star Rating:1.5 (Sorry Wahilda.)"
5,Still Waiting,"It took me a minute to actually read this book because I was expecting a follow-up to the other two. I pre-ordered this book in Feb. thinking I was gonna find out were Snake had been, who shot Trae, did Tash have twins and did Angel get married. The new book was very good, but I still want to know about the ending to Every Thugs Needs A Lady. I hope Ms. Clark does not leave her fans disappointed and come back with a follow-up very soon."
5,Element of Surprise,"This book was definitely a page turner. A lot of unexpected twists that i definitely did not expect. This book was the bomb. Its amazing how many real Brianna's are actually out there. Yes she had all the money and material things, but money cant buy happiness, and she truly found that out in the end. Never cross your true friends, because karma will come back to haunt you. Great read Wahida Clark, looking forward to the next one!!!!"
5,High Quality Cable!,"I didn't have high expectations because this cable costs significantly less than other brands. However, I am pleased to say that this is a great cable. Save your money! Buy this one instead of spending more!"
4,Great for Family Guy fans,"If you've seen the Simpsons episode guide series, you'll know exactly what you're getting here - and that's not a bad thing. Good episode synopses and quotes, and a few additional behind-the-scenes tidbits worth knowing."
1,MENS FOSSIL WATCH,"I bought this watch for a gift. Overall the watch is nice, but it doesn't work properly. We will have to send it to fossil for repair."
1,More of a Young adult fantasy novel,"The cover art sold me on this book and some of the written reviews were glowing. I was highly disappointed with this story as the writing and plot were adolescent at best.Pro- beautiful art coverCon- plot was very weak, dialogue was very monotone, each character sounded like each other. Descriptions were very brief and the text was choppy. No main character that you really felt for and the time frame was quick and generalized. Solutions were linear, A has a problem, B is the solution, C is the result.Definite pass on this book, especially if you are expecting the descriptive stories of c.s. lewis, robert jordan, george rr martin, steven erikson, raymond feist, r.a. salvatore, Goodkind, robin hobb, sara douglas, etc."
2,Dated material,"This book was recommended by my son's college counselor as being very informative. I purchased the book and found it to be incredibly verbose instead. In addition, the information provided is dated. Since Ms. Fedder is no longer at Stanford, the information she gives is no longer accurate. Specifically, she stated that they have a special catagory for those gifted in math (as for those gifted in the arts and sports) and they rely upon the recommendations of the math department to select the most gifted math student. Upon calling Stanford I was informed that that was no longer in effect.She also speaks of her low opinion of early admission/early action programs. However Stanford has had them for several years now.If I, a novice to the world of college admissions, could easily spot two significant errors, how accurate could this book be to a reader seeking information.It is also manages to say in a thousand words what couls have been said in a hundred."
5,WOW!!!,I was very surprised the size (HUGE) for the price!!! Product description is definitely accurate. I would highly recommend this purchase.
2,Too Technical and Wordy,This book is probably very appropriate for those people who want in-depth analysis. I prefer self-help books written in a conversational style.
3,the cover fits bad,"the cover fits bad, it's a little bit small compared the the glass.time wasting to put the cover on the glass."
1,Buyer Beware,Pyrex is a quality product. Nice bowls and fit tight lids.. but the box came missing a lid to one of the smaller bowls. Amazon was good enough to issue a partial (small) refund. But if I had purchased this item for a present I would have been mortified when the receiving party opened the box to find an imcomplete set. Buyer beware.
