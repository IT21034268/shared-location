5,Canon rocks in Digital Cameras,"If you are willing to ignore aesthetics of this camera then this is THE best camera in the price range. While buying a camera one must look for the CCD size (higher the better) and Optical Zoom (higher the better). Canon gives 1/1.8"" CCD size for this camera and all other 5 Mega Pixel Camera (even Canon's own SD400, S500, SD450) use 1/2.5"" CCD. Infact Canon uses the same size CCD (i.e. 1/1.8"") for its new 7 Mega Pixel Cameras.This is the second Canon digital Camera I bought for my family. The earlier one S500 is working perfectly for last one and half years and I expect this one will set new standards."
4,The best what you can get for this money!,"Excellent product, you can configure everything like in more expensive models. Only memory card is a misunderstanding 16Mb. If you decide to buy this camera order 1Gb memory card."
1,Never again,"I bought one and it ran great for 6 months. Loved it. Then suddenly it crashed. Now it cannot be accessed. Smart disk web sight offers data retrieval companies at owner expense and offers to fix the hard drive by reformatting it, but admits up front it will do nothing to retain your data. What a racket."
4,Good assortment of music,"The ""On the Line"" soundtrack is a definite must-have for NSync fans since it's not only from the movie featuring two guys from the group, but it also has two never-before-released songs from the group. In addition, the album contains music by other pop stars like Britney Spears and BB Mak. There's also a little country thrown in the the final song ""Ready to Fall"" sung by Meredith Edwards. Overall, the CD has a variety of musical genres respresented, but most of the songs are definitely love-oriented. There is a great mixture of tempo in that some songs are slow and romantic while others are upbeat and fun. Definitely a good buy though!!"
5,A Delightful Mix,"The On the Line soundtrack is a blend of everything - rock, R&B, dance, pop & country - that ranges from the guitar-driven stylings of Richie Sambora to the soulful crooning of Blaque. Standout tracks include 'N Sync's uptempo ""That Girl (Will Never Be Mine)"" and the gorgeous ballad ""Falling"", Robyn's haunting ""Say You'll Walk the Distance,"" BBMak's heartfelt ""Don't Look Down"", & both versions of ""Ready to Fall"", featuring Joey Fatone and Meredith Edwards respectively. If you're a fan of various genres of music, this is a great album to bring them altogether."
3,Second Rate Bio About a First-Rate Artist,"When published in '98 and '99, this book got some good reviews, but there wasn't much available to compare it to. Since we now have Julie Kavanagh's fantastic Nureyev biography, this is plainly a less serious undertaking. It's not very well researched, and is too gossipy and speculative. Furthermore, too many key people are missing from the narrative, so evidently they didn't want to work with the author. Their absence should alert readers that the writer wasn't sufficiently well regarded to get the Nureyev Foundations or his close friends to cooperate. It's possible that the book was being written too soon after Nureyev's death in '93, and people who really knew him just weren't up to talking about him yet, their perspective was too short, and they missed him too much.I strongly suggest opting for Kavanagh's book, it trumps all others, both in writing about the man, and his impact on the world of dance."
3,Adventures in Psycho-rock.,"From a musician's standpoint, I feel that some of the prose of this biography was a little hard to withstand. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely an interesting book. It's just that I wish the story contained MORE about Clapton's music throughout the years, lyrically and theoretically, his equipment and so on ... Clapton the musician. The author did express his opinions of his songs and his albums, which I disagreed with a lot. But opinions are just that: individual likes and dislikes, and everyone's are different. TOO MUCH stress was on Clapton's personality, love life, and inner demons ... the celebrity stuff."
5,FANtastic ! Hard-Hitting the HIGHS and Lows of EC,Definately one of the best books written about EC. Author pulls no punchs and gives a raw discription of the man and his times
3,not the best not the worst,its like this ja rule has not been the same since his debut on venni venni vetchi. This album has a few left over r&b jams from rule 336 so if u like rap music go get the 41'st side album. But if you want to here more r&b cuts get it
4,There's been worse..,"This is a good album and i guess you could say that 50 Cent bite Ja's formula. But hey, this is Ja at his best probably and has some good tunez depsite him tryna sound like Pac. Wit Ja you expect the ladies songs and singing in the chorus but he has he's gnagsta moments with Smokin' & Ridin' and So Much Pain. Ja Rule was never gonna make a classic but good album and worth gettin' even if u love 50. HahaTop 5:Smokin' & Ridin'Down Ass BitchLivin' It UpXSo Much Pain"
2,Who knew there was such a thing as manufactured rap?,"I'm sure Ja Rule was not the first to do so, but he is in the current lead as #1 manufactured, radio-friendly rapper (Jay-Z could be considered but at least he delves into underground beats once in a while). His debut was more focused on streetlife but Ja himself said that afterwards, he took a look at what sort of music sold, therefore he shaped his songs to be more appealing to the mass market. His second and now his third album have been more dependant on featured R&B singers, catchy hooks and beats, and even Ja Rule hmself singing them. Should we punish him for wanting to increase his record sales? No but some amount of substance always outweighs a load of glitter."
2,Y'all need a refresher course,"When considering how to approach this review, please realize that ""So Much Pain"" is not a Ja Rule song at all. The reason Ja sounds like 2Pac is because this is a remake of Pac's ""Pain"" off the ""Above the Rim"" soundtrack (cassette version; to get it on CD you had to buy ""More Songs from Above the Rim."") It's one of 2Pac's best songs if you ask me, and y'all need to be educated if you weren't already aware. The way Ja brought Pac in for the final verse was nice, but it only made me want to listen to the original version.Bottom line on this album is he needs to stop singing. Bring in more Lil' Mo or Christina Milian or whoever if you must be R&B, Ja, just don't try to handle the singing yourself. It doesn't come off."
3,"Ja, ja , ja oh my my oh yeah yeah","Well, i must say that this ja rule fellow could have done a little bit better on his first disc (worhtwhile) in a long time, yo. His roots are all hip hop, but he got a lotta pip pop! on his tracks. His rhymin is international stunt prop givin, but he seems to be veerin towards this jlo chick who is one of the many princesses of pop. I like it hard core, and racy. This album did not do that. but i i was feelin lost little girl, and pain is love. ja is very family oriented, and that shines thru in this album more than anything."
2,JA GETTIN TOO SLOW?,yeah he is losing his touch hes becoming too slow but LIVIN IT UP and WORLD WIDE GANGSTA are the best songs and so is IM REAL (MURDER REMIX)
1,What the..... ?,"Ja Rule lost a lot of my respect with this terrible album... Venni Vetti Vecci was his best... for all you so called Ja fans, go pick this up and listen to these songs ""Suicide Freestyle"", ""Only Begotten Son"", and ""Story To Tell"". Now, to the task at hand... I have only three songs I like... So Much Pain doesn't count because I've heard it before. Livin' It Up with Case (Ja and Case make really good songs together, see Suicide Freestyle from V V V), Lost Little Girl (powerful message, though he sings a lot), and Dial M for Murda. Wake up, Ja, and go back to Venni Vetti Vecci. Give us another ""Only Begotten Son"", PLEASE!!!!"
1,Ja Rule Sucks So Much D1ck,"Look Ja, 2Pac is the greatest rapper that ever lived. You, on the other hand, are nowhere near him. Pain is one of the best songs 2Pac ever recorded, COME UP WITH YOUR OWN LYRICS! He took 2Pacs lyrics and re-worded them just a little and is getting credit for them like he wrote them.If you want the real song, buy the cassette version of the Above The Rim soundtrack,Or Go To http://www.oldversion.com/program.php?n=kazaalite and download kazaa lite (it's better than the regular kazaa) if you don't already have it to get the song it'll be worth it and you can see how ja rule just copied 2Pac's Lyrics. The original is way better and has 2 2Pac Verses. If you know and appreciate real rap, then you wont buy this. You'll buy, 2Pac,Biggie Ice Cube Or Snoop Dogg."
1,read this,Pain is Love? Pain is Listening to that stupid album. Ja Rule is such a Dmx and Tupac rip-off. Get your own style fool. Stop taking other peoples styles and step your rap game up.
1,ANOTHER ALBUM THAT SUX,THIS GUY TO ME WENT FROM MAYBE ONE OF THE HOTTEST RAPPERS TODAY TO THE WORST. HE'S A RAPPER NOT A POP STAR. THIS IS LIKE A RAP/POP ALBUM. I DON'T LIKE IT.
1,Why the radio plays it so much,yup its me again. if the nelly album isn't bad this is worst. Ja Rule only good song on this album is probably the one that gets played tons of times a day on the radio. man i wish the radio was more like the early 90's. This album has boring songs which just kill your day. if you REALLY want some good hip hop and rap go out and get the old stuff like digital underground not this weak stuff!
3,Pain Is Love - Ja Rule (Clean) Review,"Ok, this is a pretty good album for those who aren't allowed to buy the explicit content one. You can still enjoy songs with words being blocked out."
4,Good but not the best by Ja,"Ja hasnt put out one bad album, and hasnt dissapointed his fans. This cd is good but not his best, better than rule 3:36, but venni vetti vechi is still his best album, he doesnt go as soft as he does in rule 3:36 but the album seems rushed. If ur a rule fan, buy it, otherwise you may not enjoy it so much."
2,PAIN IS LOVE,"JA RULE IS MY SECOND FAVORITE RAPPER INTHE WORLD ALL HIS CD'S IHAVE LISTEN TO ARE ALL THE BEST MUSIC I HAVE EVER HERD ASSPACIALYPAIN IS LOVE IT TOUCHES MY SOUL DEEPLY AND IT IS GRAET MUSIC. JA RULEIS VERY FAMOUS WERE I'M FROM IN SOUTH AFRIKA.I THINK EVERY PERSON SHOULD BUY THIS CD OF JA RULE BECAUSE HE IS JUTS THE BEST,PEOPLE THAT THINK THIS CD IS BORING SHOULD GO AND PLAY WITH THERE TOES BECAUSE THAN THAY RAE BORING.I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THIS NEW CD OF HIS ,AND IBET I WOULD PLAY IT AS SOON AS I GET HOME ANDLOUD TO.THATS ALL I HAVE TO SAY I MAEN WRITETO YOU PEOPLESO PAES OUT."
4,Pretty Good,"...I liked this CD a lot when I first received it, but now I don't listen to it as much, because in a way, I'm kind of bored with it. My favorite songs on here would have to be So Much Pain (the duet with 2Pac and it sounds just like 2Pac's Pain), X, Never Again, and Pain is Love. I would've named Down A** B****, Always on Time, Livin' It Up, and I'm Real as favorites, but all of these songs have been overplayed. I thought the Leo skit was very funny! I like the intro of the song Worldwide Gangsta, too. The CD is still worth getting, cuz it's still a tight album, and I think Ja Rule's a great rapper. Please, keep it up!"
2,From bad to worse,"Ja had the making to be a legend with Jay-z after his first album came out and I was hungry for his second. But something happend, he turned R&B. What?!? A rapper turning R&B, never! But it did happen. With ""Put it on me"" and ""I cry"". His hardcore ""edge"" exibited In ""Holla Holla"" of his first cd had dissappeared. Ja then went on to write several songs for r&b artists and even doing a raido friendly duet with J. Lo. Moving into this Lp. The hardcore edge is still nowhere to be seen and the soft Ja rule seems to be here to stay!"
5,Philosophy at its best.,"An insightful account of the cynical ""Zeitgeist."" Sloterdijk's book is-after 15 years-still a fresh wind in the grey landscape of Philosophy. He writes with ""verve,"" thinks wonderfully unsystematic, and says what we all (more or less) think. Highly recommendable to the flexible mind. Juergen Kleist, Plattsburgh, New York"
2,Incoherence hurts great theme,"Maybe I should not be reviewing this book, which I have only superficially skimmed -wanted to dig in but found it unreadable.Correct me if I missed Clow describing the actual ""channeling"" session? I guess lineality is antithetical, so there's no explaining about how much of the text is pure channeling or a combination of the author's expression and Sayta's. To add to my dilemma, I'm totally lost on Astrology, a very serious underpinning for this work. Yes, I think Universal Gravitation affects us in a personal way but I'll never be convinced that enough people could be studied to make it a science.Clow/Satya speak of nine dimensions - I still do not understand the first four. What makes a dimension? A part of space our sensoriums can't deal with? More depressing confusion.Why don't the Channelers ever ask the Chanelees how to cure cancer? Have they? Once again, I ask for guidance."
2,"Misconceptions at best, intentional trickery at worst!","I have always been open minded about all theories of reality and the existance of life. When I heard of the Photon Band, I was unbelievably enthused. This was something that felt like it might be real, and correspond with personal revelations that I've had in my life. When I began researching the Photon Belt, I came across the name of this book. I was so hopeful that this book would shed light on the true facts about the Photon Belt and its discovery; no luck. This book like all other sources on the Photon Belt states that ""The Photon Band was first detected in 1961 by means of satellite-borne instruments"". This is all the proof they have of its existence. (...) While you as a reader may be interested in such theories, you may be interested in some of the theories in the book. As a fellow human being, I implore you to keep your wits about you if you decide to read this book. Don't believe everything you read!"
1,Wannabe Sabatini,"I was quite looking forward to this ""star-spanning, swashbuckling, epic adventure"" which hinted at being a lovely combination of space opera and Rafael Sabatini. Unfortunately it's not much more than a tepid tale of betrayal and revenge with hardly any swashbuckling and little action. Too many tongue-twisting names, titles, and unnecessary tweaking of everyday words to make them more alien to the reader. Blah. Read ""Captain Blood"" instead."
3,Let Us Not Go As Far To Say...,"I was given this as an early Christmas present and I had no intention of buying it.I had heard all of the songs off it except for the Scatterbrain remix and after listening to this CD I pretty much got what I expected.Radiohead is my favourite band and all but this is hardly the calibre of material the fans expect from them.These are b-sides afterall but the OK Computer b-sides blow these away besides a few true gems on this CD (Paperbag Writer,I Will LA version and Four Tet's remix of Scatterbrain).Not to say this CD is terrible.If it wasn't for the lyrics this would be another Pablo Honey(a 2).I've noticed people on Amazon are very generous.I tell it how it is.Remyxomatosis and I Am Citizen Insane are the only bumps in the road.They are tolerable...first you'll think they are garbage but they should grow on you a bit.In closing,buy this if you have everything else."
2,poor,"These guys are interesting usually, but this was disappointing. I loved OK Computer and Kid A and I think these guys are definitely unique but this seemed to very sparse. This seemed more like a few studio experiments with electronic percussion and sound effects."
4,"Life in Crested Butte was not easy, but life was good!","The author's storytelling not only keeps the attention of the reader as he draws you into the past through his childhood memories, but also as he retells the stories that were told to him by those who have passed on to Avalon. It's remarkable to read of such poverty and hardship of the families in this town who really seemed to have all they needed; in the author's words, ""We had family, love, food, drink and a tingle in our toes that made us want to dance at the first sound of a polka."" You won't put this book down once you start it, (unless you run to the bakery for a potica), and when you finish, you'll wish he'd written more."
3,Shakiest camera work ever!,"I definately liked the film. Uwe boll did a good job with this film. But I almost had a seizure with all the shaky camera work. Its some of the worst I have ever encountered. 'The Sheild' did it well without going overboard with it. Rampage could have been alot better if were not for that one reason. Overall, I enjoyed all the action from start to finish. Did not expect this from the failure that is Uwe Boll. Hopefully next time he can do without the crazy shakes!"
2,Yeah right...,"This movie is fails at everything except at being gratuitously violent. It's unrealistic to the extreme (even grand theft auto is more realistic than this) and I never really understood why this seemingly normal young man with good parents decided to start killing people randomly. Okay, so they wanted him to get his own apartment but they were willing to help pay for most of it and they seemed really supportive. There wasn't much of anything that led up to him killing a bunch of people, nothing convincing anyway. If the directer was trying to say something with this film, I didn't get it."
1,dont buy,What a cruddy inflatable. It lasted exactly 10 minutes before it ripped and partially deflated. All we did was fill it with candy to use in a parade. Terrible quality!
3,Yawn!,"I picked this book up from the library after reading that Banville won the Booker Prize for ""The Sea"". Plus, I love reading history books about 16th and 17th century science. So I figured: How could I go wrong?Well, the good thing about ""Kepler"" is that it was short. If it had been more than 200 pages, I just wouldn't have made it through. I liked the beginning part of the book, when Kepler meets Tycho for the first time, but after that it went downhill. Simply put: The last half of the book was a snoozer. Nothing much happens. Which is a shame, because Kepler was an extraordinarily interesting historical figure. I was waiting to be riveted, and it just didn't happen.I really tried hard to like this book, but it just didn't do it for me."
3,Hard to believe...,"Okay...this is too detailed and specific to be believable...since when hypnotherapy became a proven scientific method? To me, they are just illusions/delusions/lies to make money off selling books."
2,"Questions, questions.....","It is a fascinating book and the uniformity of reports about the spirit world from his patients is compelling. Yet, we know very little of Mr. Newton himself. He claims to be a PhD but where was he educated? If you do a search you'll come up with nothing (or at least I came up with nothing). He's said to have been on the faculty of higher educational institutions as a teacher. Which institutions and in what capacity? Again, a blank.Why isn't there transparency here? It's not like this information is somehow confidential or sensitive. All this is suspicious to me and smacks of someone with something to hide. And this taints the legitimacy of his research which remains uncorroborated. Until there are answers to these questions, just two stars from me."
3,Between Lives,"This is a believable account of a souls experiences between lives. There are 25 case histories recorded by HypnotherapistMichael Newton. The accounts have a somewhat similar thread running through them, giving a sense of truth to the reader.However I would have liked more discriptions of the environmentand the different activities experienced by the soul, surely thirty or forty years which is apparently spent between lives is not totally taken up with examining the last life and planning for the next one. Just a mild criticism , otherwise I enjoyed the book very much."
3,"Not a really easy book to read, very clinical","Haven't been able to finish yet, because more complicated to understand than I thought it would be."
5,Journey of Souls,A mind-blowing account of life after death! This book cannot help but arouse and inform your conscious mind with details of the 'other side'. You start to look at your own life and connect the dots with the people around you who are connected in a more meaningful way than you could imagine. A definite - MUST READ for all those seeking answers.
5,Great look of life between lives,"Great book; a must read for others who are looking for answers about death; who we really are - Soul instead of just a physical body and mind, the meaning of life and reincarnation."
2,Great read but is it true?,"This book is a great read. Life after death, meaning in life, many lives many opportunities. Wouldn't it be great if it were all true! Nice story but not much proof here. Reminds me of the works of Carlos Castinada, although I think Castinada did a better job making his stories realistic."
2,far from reality,I thought I would read a book about some evidence based information/incidents but it's far from that. The basis of hypnosis is imagination and the hypnotist can guide the subject and gives him direction. During the hypnosis is the mind full of imagination and can create almost everything.This book is not about spirit world but the powerful human mind and IMAGINATION. Nothing more!
5,JOURNEY OF SOULS,I Love this book. Dr. Newtons findings agree with what I have learned and expanded on it.A real interesting read!
4,"Oh, Sweet Memories","I was 10 years old in 1974 and remember fondly watching this series and was sad when it was canceled prematurely.Watching them again on DVD is really fun and although the stories and plots are simplistic, to a child they are pure fantasy and fun.There seems to be some harmless racist undertones (especially in the episode ""The Deception"") , I just ignore them and enjoy the shows for what they are.Also excellent picture and sound !!"
5,At Last,"I have waited a long time for this series to be released. I grew up with the original movies, and used to watch the 5 edited t.v. movies of the series that used to be shown. Then when the Sci-fi channel showed all 14 episodes, I had a whole new outlook on the complete series. I think that the t.v. series has better characters, and helps broaden the planet of the apes universe. General Urko makes the whole series worth watching. I will now feel complete owning the whole planet of the apes movies on dvd."
3,To Slow and boring. Urko is good,"The shows are too slow. Barely anything happens. The astronauts are horrible actors. Urko is great. A gorilla is much stronger than a man, but always loses a fight with the lame astronauts. They have a horse race episode. You get to see the astronaut make a toy plane out of wood in another (I think they do that one in real time). The most intense part of the show is the opening credits; which are good. Better stories and better lead humans could have save the series."
1,A major miss-step when brought to weekly T.V.,"I was a big fan of the movies but even at 8 years old I could see that the series was not very good. The first mistake they made was letting all humans talk in the show(a mistake that they also made in the 2001 remake),as this makes the apes seem more cruel for hunting and killing talking animals. Even without this error the show was light on strong stories and long on poor action scenes. I know some like the show but as big a fan as i am i just can't recommend this one, even as a blast from the past."
3,"Great reader, awful text","I thought this book would have been a great source of information for personal use, however my professor used it as a text and it didn't work well for me. I think its too dense to use as a text, especially if it is the sole book being used in the class."
2,What About The Annual Gasket Replacement,"The use and care instructions say that the big ""O"" ring gasket should be replaced annually. Good Luck!!!!! You can't find it listed at [...] as a replacement part and when you call to order it it takes them 30 min to even find the part in the system. I ordered mine 3 weeks ago for $[...] each plus $[...] s&h; and they still have not been seen.I love the way the case works and you can't beat the access to the functions while underwater, however I think that Canon has blown it when it comes to the gasket maintenance.If I cant trust it to last more than 1 year and I can't get the gaskets from them even after I paid for them the product is not a good deal."
3,"Multi-dimensional, although a bit cold","This book operates on more than one level. The meaning behind supposed trivial activities that many of the characters undertake will not be lost on the observant reader. Best if read twice, first for the entertaining and light story of eco destruction, time travel and character portraits, afterwards for the subtlety of Benford's clever use of symbolism (his fascination with relative point of reference dominates). Book that works well for those looking for a light summer read as well as for deeper meaning, although ending is weak, Benford tries too hard and many episodes are irrelevant. No Orwell is he."
2,I cant believe that this managed to win the Nebula award,"The basic plot of this book is not that bad and could have been developed into something intereseting. But unfortunately Benford only devotes no more than 40 of the 400 pages to this. The rest of the space is filled up with garbage about the personal love/ sex lives of his characters. If he was trying to make them 'interesting', he failed miserably. Benford would have done much better sticking to the plot, without getting too much into the personalities. Over all it is a waste of time. The only reason I am giving two stars, is because I feel bad about giving one."
2,Disappointment,"I read the back of this book and was very attracted to the premise. However I felt that Benford fell short of my expectations on many counts. He spent a great deal of the book furnishing us with irrelevant aspects of the characters lives whilst neglecting to fully explain some of the more important aspects of the book, for example the 1998 ecological situation.His characters appeared very clichéd and I felt upon reading this novel that Benford is a complete misogynist under the impression that women will succumb to any man without a second thought. It seems he has a very over-inflated ego regarding his sexual prowess.This book was one I had to plough through and although I enjoyed the end I felt he did not fully develop or explain events and that this story would be better served as a short story eliminating a lot of the unnecessary rambling prose. The style of writing indicated someone trying desperately to impress with vocabulary however this only succeeded in excluding the reader."
4,I wanted at least a B- in Physics!,"I didn't read Professor Benford's book, but I'm rating it a 7.9/10 just because he gave me a C+ in Physics at UC Irvine. But I'm biased, so don't take my review seriously. I'm sure ""Timescape"" is a good book"
2,Timewaste,"Incredibly dull ""hard SF"" novel reads more like a soap opera set in the nail-bitingly-intense world of academia. Skip it."
3,Good...But...,"Gregory Benford's `Timescape' is a difficult book for me to review. I liked the idea of trying to communicate back into time to advert a present day ecological disaster. I also liked how Benford gave time to his characters (both present and past), making them real people and not cardboard characters (the problem with much of sci-fi). However, a problem cropped up while reading `Timescape'. I found myself skim-reading far too frequently. I'm not sure just why, but it might be that Benford's descriptive text was far too laboring (at least it was for this reader).I liked `Timescape' and I'm sure many out there will enjoy it. After reading so much science fiction without real-life characters, this novel was refreshing, however, I can't really recommend it as a must read. Between 1 and 10, `Timescape' gets a marginal 6."
2,This Book is Totally Boring,"OK. i may be only 14, but i've read alot of books. and this is not one of the best books i've read. The developement of the plot is too slow, and in some places the book seems to go nowhere. There's just too much writing, and not enough excitement. The story doesnt build up to a grand ending. Instead, it starts out as a great story, and just fades away at the end. One thing good, however, is the orginality of this book. The idea of a story about communicating with the past to change the future is, in my perspective, a very interesting concept. I recommend that you borrow the book and read the first 20 pages before you buy it, as half the people i know likes this book, and the other half doesnt."
5,I WAS A MIDDLE-AGED WEREWOLF!,"If there was one Highway To Heaven episode that many viewers remembered from season three the most, I Was A Middle-Aged Werewolf have to be the one. A spoof on the 1957 cult classic, ""I Was A Teenage Werewolf"" (Which lunched Michael Landon to stardom), it's what many to be concerised as THE most remembered Highway To Heaven episode ever!Thanks to A&E;, we now relived to see this, and all the other season three episodes."
1,Not Impressed with the writer,I was extremely disapointed in the quality of the writing of this book. The writer kept repeating herself over and over in each chapter to the point that it became very boring and frustrating also mundane. And I also felt that it was way too out there almost sci-fi. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
4,Pleiadian -Starseeds,"I got this book because I just found out I'm a ""Starseed"" a Year ago from Pleiadian, I'm doing my research, this book help explains the history of the Universe! its all in your DNA and the different races ET...I could go on, but to connect with other starseeds go to: [...] I think people are more open now and the truth is out there!"
1,deserves no stars,"Terrible.....So disapointed with the vocals on this album. No emotion whatsoever.....the guritaring is so mainstream and and boring. No unbelievable keyboarding, no dark melodic sounds....just plain ole bad music. It seems that evergrey wants to be played on american nu metal bands. How can one band take such a drastic turn for the worse when they have one of the greatest sounds in dark melodic metal today.....i'm crying right now but no one can see it because i'm on a computer!"
3,This album quickly goes stale.,"As much as I enjoyed hearing this album the first five times, due to its more straight forward approach which produces an immediate affect, another five spins has the music gowing a bit stale. In the Evergrey catalog I would actually place this release somewhere in the middle to lower-middle area far below ""Recreation Day"" and ""In Search of Truth"" which remain their finest efforts. I initially gave this album 4 stars, but since it has very little staying power it is really closer to 3 stars in the long run. I prefer albums that become more interesting with each spin, not ones that become more stagnant upon return visits. Hopefully, Evergrey will someday embrace those progressive elements from their earlier albums that made them so special and return to greatness. Thank you."
2,"Great idea, poor implementation","This goggles look good on the picture, but I'm not sure what kind of head was used when the original mold was created - apparently a flat one with a paper-thin nose. When I've tried them on, they hurt my nose and there were huge gaps on both sides of my temples. Making the elastic tighter made my nose hurt even more.They are might be OK for a Halloween costume, when goggles aren't worn the way they are intended, but on the top of the head, but any kind of practical application is out of the question."
3,"Better for fun and not for ""google"" activities","I bought these googles for Burning Man, which is an event that requires good, durable googles to prevent lots of desert dust from getting into your eyes. Not the right product. But, they are cute and would be fun for young kids to reinact Quidditch games."
5,Harry Potter Quidditch Goggles,"Very excited about these goggles! All we could find were swimming goggles, but we needed something to look like Amelia Earnhart's gear. This worked great! The adjustable strap let it be worn by a child or an adult. The padding around the eyes made it much more durable than I expected. The price made this an especially good find. With the Amazon Prime overnight shipping for $3.99, we got it in time for our classes. Can't say enough about how happy we are with this product for what we needed and the speed and ease of ordering and shipping."
4,found it cheaper,"I love the product. It's perfect for those of us who don't drink a pot of coffee a day and are watching our diets. One cup in the morning with fat free flavored creamer is wonderful. I also like the white chocolate flavor, however, I found it cheaper at Walmart. Not this flavor but all is good."
4,Beautiful!,I was really interested in the pendant from this purchase. It's my birthstone and my mom says that it matches my personality. A little devlish. The only thing I didn't like is the cheap chain. I'm on the search for a new one that holds that huge ruby up. Still very satisfied with my purchase and the price I paid.
2,Not what ud expect...,"i bought this necklace for a girl and when it came i was very disappointed. the picture they have displayed gives u a much different idea about the product. first off its very small and fragile looking,wats worse is it doesnt even lie flat when ur wearin it..."
4,great necklace for the price,"I got this for my girlfriend as a birthday gift, and she loves it. The design is perfect for her personality, and she loves gold jewelry. I only gave it 4 stars because it got tarnished while just sitting in my closet for the 3 months that I had it prior to her birthday (I bought it as soon as I found it because I know how amazon prices are subject to change on a daily basis). I'm a guy that doesn't really wear too much jewelry, so I had no clue how to get rid of the black tarnish and had to look it up, and invest a few hours in figuring out a solution. That frustration is the only reason this product got 4 stars. It is great quality so far as I am concerned, and it is well worth the investment if you have a little devil in your life that would appreciate the gift."
2,design flaw,chain is too thin and it tends to flip downward does not display right on neck to show the details of pendant...
4,What every woman thinks....,A great book for anyone who's ever visited Australia or just dreamed of doing so and wants to know how women on the other side of the world view topics like dating and child rearing. Ms. Killeen has the unique skill of saying just want women think with a comical 'Aussie' twist. Brush up on your Australian slang and dive in.
3,Lost in noise,"Reading the other reviews for this I hear a lot of high praise for the covers this artist performed of songs from Skyrim. Those covers are indeed wonderful songs and Judith De Los Santos has a beautiful singing voice. Unfortunately, those covers are not included on this album and I felt that that voice was mostly lost amidst the various pop and rock tones taking their place. There are moments of inspiration within, but all too often they seem drowned out by explosive electric guitar riffs and heavy drum beats. It's decent enough, but I do hope that in future releases she focuses more on her own voice and less on the background noise."
2,"Good idea, but newer better versions","I had these jump soles ten years ago and they were awkward to wear, but they do provide a good exercise. Since they attach to your shoe rather than being built into the shoe, they move around when you are running and jumping and you frequently have to adjust the straps. It is a great idea by putting body weight on your toes, but there are better options.The newer ATI jump training shoe is a better choice for ten dollars more. It has an actual shoe built in to the jump sole. If, for some reason you would rather use your own shoes with the jump sole attachment, you might want to get this. However, I don't see why you would want to unless you have a friend that has a close shoe size to you."
2,Pretty Disappointed - Skip this One,"This season is definitely my least favorite season of Survivor on DVD. Most of the people were very irritating most of the time. Boston Rob, John, Hunter and Cleopatra were the only interesting people in this one. Had to force myself to watch as opposed to enjoy watching it. A lot of over the top love-in, butt-kissing crap and way too much religious nonsense. I am definitely gun-shy now about buying Thailand but will likely buy Amazon. If I could go back I wouldn't have bought this one."
1,WON'T RUN IN OUR DVD PLAYER!!!,"Like another person posted, these do NOT come as a ""boxed set"" as pictured. They almost look like bootleg copies (reminds me of stuff I've received off eBay before)!! AND they won't run in our newer DVD player!! They WILL run on computers and in our OLD DVD player - but not our newer one hooked to our flat screen TV with sound system. VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING and surprised to receive such a product from Amazon!!!"
5,Best of the Survivor Series,"This season of Survivor is my personal favorite, and I hope to see it released on DVD soon, as well as all of the other seasons that have not yet been released. I'd like it even if they were bundled together in 2-season sets, something like this - (3)Africa & (4)Marquesas, (5)Thailand & (6)Amazon, (11)Guatemala & (12)Panama, (13)Cook Islands & (14)Fiji, and (15)China & (16)Micronesia."
1,Would not recommond buying this.,"I was very excited to be able to buy this season and since I wanted to keep, I paid extra for a new copy. When I got the dvds, they were really scratched and dirty. Some of them played with no problem while others skipped and froze. I contacted support about the problem and they sent a replacement saying it must have slipped through the cracks. Replacement came same problems. I also bought two other seasons of survivor that were Manufactured on Demand and had the same results. Don't waste your money on this. Hopefully CBS will release good copies in the near future."
2,Disappointed,When I received the item I wondered if it was real or a bootleg. All previous Survivor seasons came packaged in a nice box. This was three loose boxes in shrink wrap. The individual hard cases for the disks in previous seasons had different cast members on the cover. This one had the same people. A few of the episodes had very poor picture quality - reminded me of a copy of a copy of a copy of a vhs tape that was put on a dvd.I am extremely leary now of purchasing the other 2 Survivor seasons that are available here.
2,Doesn't hold up to the test of time,"I'm a big survivor fan. I've seen nearly every season at this point, and this was the second survivor season that I saw. I loved it at the time, and have been anxiously awaiting it's release. But now after viewing it again, it wasn't as good as I remembered. In fact, it really doesn't hold up to the newer seasons.There was so little strategy by these contestants, so little drama, so few heroics, and certainly no memorable villains. Neither of the final 2 really seemed very deserving (in terms of controlling the game or in terms of dominating challenges). The whole season was just very ""meh"" in hindsight. I'd be hard pressed to rank anything that happened in this season as one of the more memorable survivor moments, and the same could be said for the participants themselves. I guess it's a testament to how good the later seasons have become that this one seems to vanilla."
2,not the best survivor,I thought this was a pretty lame show for survivor. I own all the available series and this one was by far my least favorite.
4,finally here,"The only thing I am a little disappointed in is the packaging, all cd's in separate cases nothing to keep them together, but after the long wait, I am excited to have it."
1,Counterfeit,"Survivor AFRICA. This is a new copy for sure. Cheap, paper-covered discs dated 01/04/11 with incomplete etching on the play side. Shame. This purchase has RETURN written all over it."
4,For film and opera lovers,A film that deserves more viewers. The allegory on the european union is a bit dated but the conflicts in the orchestra rehearsing a Wagner Opera and the relationship of the diva with the conductor are timeless.
1,This book is wrong on all counts,"How anyone can truly believe Dick Morris would have anything to say of value is beyond me. What a complete waste of money - thankfully I charged it to the taxpayers - just like my New York trips. The book read like a self-promotion for the website. His comments on how Alan Keyes won the first debate are very far off, it only means Keyes made sure his supporters voted."
2,I wanted to like it...,"Believe me, when I picked up this book, I wanted to like it. I thought I surely would! I mean, it's set here in Chicago and revolves around the lives of identical twins (also quite applicable to me!). And while it was an engrossing story, it left me feeling unsatisfied and that the whole book was rather inconclusive.Also, and I am not quite sure why, the book oozed self-publication, and despite the author claiming to live in Chicago, it seemed as though some of the details were pretty off. I also didn't see the point in the focus being almost entirely sexual... it is hard to maintain, and Frangello definitely did not keep my interest. I also felt like all the characters were unattractive and unlikeable. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone other than my own sister, and even then just to see what she thinks of it.Maybe someday I will re-visit this book and see if my opinion has shifted, but I think it will be on the shelf a long while before that happens."
1,Lacks humility and irony,"Summary: Fundamentalism is a response to Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment and includes particularly religious people of all conservative stripes. Fundamentalists behave as if will-to-power is necessary to establish the regimes or the public space they feel is necessary for them to practice their faith. Individual Fundamentalists may not be stupid, but their behavior leads to stupid outcomes--""they are selfish, greedy and stupid"" (pg. 217). ""Protestant fundamentalism is a dangerous religion"" (ibid.) as are all other forms of fundamentalism.Malise Ruthven lacks any sense of epistemological or philosophical humility or irony. As far as I can tell, he is what he loathes in ""fundamentalists,"" only well-educated, sophisticated, and published by Oxford Press."
4,Llorando,"One of the most unforgettable scenes of the movie was the scene in Club Silencio where the music plays but ""no hay bando."" This scene was eerily haunting and heartbreaking at the same time. Who could forget Rebekah Del Rio's heartwrenching version of Roy Orbison's Crying sang in Spanish and a capella. This soundtrack will transport you inside David Lynch's film noir where everything is not what it seems."
1,tiny bags that are kinda silly,"All the bags in this book are very small. Also, None are good projects for adult sewers. All were kind of juvinile and not sturdily made. Most weren't sewn at all."
2,I'ts a book for girls,"This is a good book for arts and crafts for girls, useful for a middle school teacher.If you are looking for something advance or a pattern book, you are chosen the wrong one."
3,Fits description,"Clear bird calls, with a softer babbling brook in the background. I personally would have preferred a higher brook to bird ratio, as the bird calls can be a bit piercing at times :)"
3,"Take five, please","The upshot is that this orchestration, while nice enough, doesn't do anything good to the original piece (and I heard it live as well). If you're a fan of the original, I suggest you buy the digitally remastered version of ALS which includes a live version on the second CD.Unless you're a fan of orchestration from quartet to big band (and this is done far more frequently in the classical world), or have money to burn, I'd avoid this CD."
4,Let's be honest,"Let's be honest here guys, it's by no stretch of the imagination anything to the original. That's a given, but you have to look beyond that. A piece can be interpreted a thousand ways, one thing should not stay one thing forever. I thought Wynton did a good job at preserving a lot of the emotion from the original, while still adding his own interpretation. WHICH IS THE POINT. It's not supposed to be the original! I thought that a good 75% of the solos hit the nail right on the head, and some were even straight up transcriptions of the original solos! I thought that that ensemble work in Resolution was spectacular, and the same goes for Pursuance. My point is that lots of people reviewing this album are saying that it's not as good as the original, but that's not the point. No remake will ever be as good as the original, but this album is a good twist on the original, something that retains a lot of emotion, gets you into it, and it's something different. Worth the buy."
4,Concise and Handy,The Book of Common Worship - Pastoral Edition is one of my favourite tools for ministry. I love the fact that it has full orders of service as well as many selections of scriptures passages and prayers. It is wonderful to bring on visits to the hospital. I also like to use it at funerals and Communion Services. It's small size is handy to just place in my purse and take anywhere. Well worth the price.
3,in reality they look as cheap as they cost,"I bought this watches because they look great on a picture in reality the material looks very cheap,the box looks ugly, the mechanizme to setup watches is uncomfortable.The leather belt looks exteemly ugly."
1,old product not satisfied with quality,These both were outdated products that smelled terrible and rancid(have used fresh ones that smell fantastic)so am not satisfied with this source. Will be careful to avoid this one in the future
4,"Has the typical Fanclub repetitiveness, but a fine record","An alternative scene sensation some years ago, Teenage Fanclub never topped this CD although their others all have good moments. Alcoholiday is THE classic Fanclub track that everyone into this scene knows and loves. The Concept and December are well in the same league. Unfortunately What You Do To Me's laughable repetition stinks, an Satan is an unneccessary guitar solo. But overall enough class is here to make this a good buy at the price."
3,Spun it three times -- no more,"I bought this cd sometime in 2011 from the reject bin of my local second spin for cheap because I thought ""this is supposed to be good I guess I'll give it a shot"". After sorting through hundreds of other cds I hadn't had a chance to spin this one finally came up in the queue. I gave it one listen and thought ""hmm, I may never spin this again"".So...I forced myself to listen to it two more times to let it sink in and I can say with confidence I'll never reach for it off my cd shelf again. The last track was sorta cool and a couple others were decent scattered on the album but I wouldn't ever voluntarily put it on again.As an investment this didn't hold up. I see tons of other reviews from people who cherished this cd in their youth so many of their views are gonna be skewed in favor of the album. I'd give it a Neither (in Christgau parlance)."
5,Classic must have in every sense,"and quit already with the lame Big Star fodder. I've listened to #1 Record and Radio City countless times and neither can touch Bandwagonesque. Who cares if Chilton and co. had influence here, guess what they were influenced too. And last I checked the Fannies wrote these great pop rock tunes not Big Star. Anyways, this album truly is perfection. Great pop rock tunes galore, especially The Concept, December, and Alcoholiday. But what gives this album an edge is the two instrumental tracks, which shows the Fannies versatility."
4,"better than ""nevermind"" anyday...","really too bad that they are so underrated but then again such a band is best left as our personal secret, something we can listen to while everyone else ""rocks out"" to bon jovi, hopefully a higher entity WON'T spare their souls. but anyway bandwagonesque has one particular song, ""Alcoholiday"", that is easily worth the six bucks you'll pay for the cd. I'm quite aware of the significance of the song and it being the definite tennage fanclub song but no matter what tag the song comes with it is brillaint. The Concept and Guiding Star are also quite integral to the overall scope of the album. While most the songs are basic pop (most, not all) the way in which they formulate the songs makes this pop actually enjoyable to listen to without feeling that terrible guiltness, which I really wouldn't know anything about:) anyway its 6 bucks and for that much you can't really can't go wrong unless it's oasis or something..."
5,A MUST FOR M*A*S*H FANS,"Like it or hate it, this is a MUST for us M*A*S*H Completists. As far as I know, this series hasn't been seen since the Mid-80s when it originally aired. I personally have nothing but fond memories of it. (Although I hated it when they switched actresses playing Mildred Potter and made the character an idiot.)There is a whole generation of M*A*S*H fans who have NEVER seen the show & would probably LOVE to judge for themselves. NOTHING could ever follow-up the greatest TV series ever..... But ....I found this show a nice attempt.PLEASE FOX, FOLLOW UP THE FINAL M*A*S*H DVD RELEASE WITH THIS SINGLE ""COMPLETE SERIES"" BOX SET !!!!!!!!!And don't forget to include the RARELY seen RADAR TV pilot.... W*A*L*T*E*R !!!!!!!"
3,spin-off,"This was a series that aired one year after M*A*S*H ended. At the start of the last season of M*A*S*H, Harry Morgan (who played Col. Potter), Jamie Farr (who played Klinger), and William Christopher (who played the priest) voted for another season to happen. So, a spin-off was made.This show takes place in Potter's hometown. He works at a hospital with Klinger and the priest, Father Mulchay.The show lasted for one, one and a half seasons. It featured two guest appearances by Gary Burghoff (who played Radar)."
1,Try YouTube,"It wasn't the worst show ever on television, but that's about the nicest thing I can say about AfterMASH. As a M*A*S*H afficionado, I was curious about this show, so I googled it and actually found it on youtube. If you're interested, then check it out over there. I doubt you'll be able to get past the first episode. There's a reason they cancelled it in season 2. It reminds me of Joey, the not-quite-awful, but not-quite-good spin-off of Friends. It's not terrible, but it leaves you wondering why they bothered. You'll wonder why you bothered if you actually buy this show--that is if it ever comes out on DVD."
3,"Save your $$$$, Buy Vinnie Moore's ""The Maze""","I own all UFO and Vinnie Moore recording including imports. Imagine my excitement when I found out that Vinnie was on the new UFO. Boy was I mad when I heard recycled Vinnie riff/songs!Anything for a buck,huh, Mr. Record Executive? Well it sounds great but hey! I already loved these songs. Save your money. Buy Misdemeanor instead if you want non Schenker UFO. Atomik Tommy is a tasteful guitarist and the songs are good."
3,song query response,"Hey Jim, that song you were wondering about when he gets the car is ""Them Bones"" by Alice In Chains.Hope you get into it."
1,Blu-ray Review,BEWARE! Terrible video quality. Worse than the SDVD. Don't wast your money. Story starts off quite interesting but never really gets interesting or meaningful.
4,Great stuff but I'll be sleeping alone,"I really like this product. The smell is robust and doesn't smell frilly. If you're wondering how much this is, it's 100ml which is about the size of a bar of hotel soap. The bottle has a drip opening so it's meant to be shaken into your hands then wiped on your face. Try not to shake too vigorously or you'll end up with an overpowering amount on your face. It definitely burns my skin, but that lets me know it's working.The only reason I can't keep it is because my wife can't stand the smell. So into the donation box it goes. As a follow-on I've ordered a TOBS sample pack from another site. Do a web search for Taylors of Old Bond Street Sample Kit and find a product that works for you. Hopefully something in that sample kit will win points with my wife.If you purchase this through the Amazon seller ""FGP"" buyer beware they charge a 15% restocking fee that is not easily discernable."
2,Yawn.,"Ice skater Sonia Henje was one of Fox's big, big stars back in the Great Depression... Her particular charms don't hold up well over the years, though, and modern audiences may simply find her too cuddly and bland to hang with in films like this. Apparently this plot-heavy romantic comedy was meant to show her dramatic range, but it's a real snoozer... Henje had an elfin, Bjork-like quality to her... but this fluffy, uneventful film was certainly no ""Dancer In The Dark."""
5,Once Upon A Time,"I happen to own this album on an LP. signed personally on the jacket by Tony Bennett.... It has never been opened, or on a turntable...it will be priceless someday, as you can no longer buy this in an LP... ""ANY PLACE"".. I spent around twenty minutes visiting Tony Bennett at one of his Art Shows... What a special time with a ""LEGEND"" I din't wash my hands for a week after shaking his hand!!!! This album is timeless with Berlin Music"
1,What she didn't say is here,"Baumrind, Diana. The average expectable environment is not good enough: A response to Scarr. Child Development. Vol 64(5), Oct 1993, 1299-1317.The above reference is the other side of the coin. Ask your library to get a copy of it to see what Harris didn't tell you."
5,A smart book written by a smart woman...,"J Harris wrote probably one of the most interesting book in psychology in that end of century...I hope it will be translated in French (the country I am from...)It made me start to explore my relationships with my schoolmates during my childhood instead of being focused on those with my parents and I found very valuable things to explain some of the features of my personality...More over, it will be very helpful to raise my own kids in the future Anyway, it is a great book !"
3,He must be doing something right,"For the book having sold the quantity it has the author must be doing something right. However, I personally was disappointed by the contents of the book. It is not that it is not relevant but I have found other books that are more inspiring, like ""How to make a hell of a profit and still get to heaven""."
5,I can't believe this CD is out of print,"Steve Forbert has continued to be an outstanding songwriter & performer. Many came to Steve in the late 70's and after a mediocre 4th album, he largely disappeared for a few years, and from people's minds. Had the opportunity to see him Live in London in January 2008, and he is as sharp and talented as ever, sounding still as if he were in his 20's.This album, which I picked up just after that show, The American In Me, is great from start to finish. If you like Steve at all, grab this one - it won't easily leave your CD player.And see Steve perform live - he's playing great, small venues these days to enthusiastic crowds - outstanding stuff."
4,The best book yet by Laura Crum,"I discovered Laura Crum by accident and have read all her books. This new one is the best yet! The mystery is interesting and believeable right to the surprising twist at the end. A great read, especially for those who like horses and the high sierras."
4,Trail Riders Guide,"Being a trail rider myself I found Slickrock a guide of what to do and what not to do when riding and camping on the trail. Most horsepeople would not think of riding over some of the places that our heros did in the book. I found some of the places and events a little improbable but then doesn't that make a good novel. This book should appeal to both horse lovers and outdoors lovers. Thought I had the villian pegged right up to the end and then ""surprise""."
5,"This is amazing, otherworldly music","First things first. Olivier Messiaen was a 20th century composer. This is not Vivaldi. This is not this stuff you hear piped into Victoria's Secret stores. This is raw, powerful, atonal music. And I love it.I've only started to discover the amazing world of Messiaen, and in my opinion, solo piano is a good starting place for dissonant music. Instead of trying to interpret an entire orchestra's motives, you can concentrate on just one instrument.This particular piece is stunning in its scope (about two hours long) and subject matter (a musical interpretation of twenty different viewpoints on the infant Jesus). Messiaen's deep religious faith has produced a work of amazing clarity and focus.Pierre-Laurent Aimard, a former pupil of Messiaen's, tackles this daunting piece amazingly well. This is a beautiful piece of music that may be difficult to digest, but those with the patience to explore it fully will be greatly rewarded."
3,"Average tape, was hoping for excellent","It's hard to find a good cassette tape at a reasonable price anymore. The only two making them now seems to be Maxell and Sony. Been using Maxell for a couple years now and read several reviews that felt these 120 minute Sony's were the better of the two. I didn't find that to be the case. They are certainly no better. In fact the sound quality is not as good as Maxell and the Sony ""clicks and ticks"" while running. We do listen to a lot of soft, quiet music so it's more noticable and more of an annoyance for us. But the Maxell's do this also so that ""beef"" is just a wash. It's not a deck problem either as the clicking is still there whether it's being played in my JVC, Teac, Technics, or either of my Pioneers.So they are just OK and because we are so limited now as to brands to choose from, we must accept it.Thanks,MR"
2,Terrible story .-.;,"It's kind of hard to understand because it is written in like.. an old-timey sort of way..So I can't relate to it at all..The story sucks..I bought it brand new, though, and oh my god, the book itself--the design and pages and layout and fonts--are just brilliant!I want to be a designer when I get older, so I appreciate that quality of it. ^^It's a very slow moving story, though.. I'm about.. 150 pages into it out of 340, though..So what I say about the story being crap isn't like.. gospel or anything.. Just a so-far opinion."
3,It's OK,"it was ok , but not really my thing, i was loking for something romantic, but disappointed is what i found, too much blablabla that I almost fall asleep. :/."
3,Summer Flop,"I commend this book for its moral sense and recommend it in the study of dating practices during the 40s, but this is one of the most boring books I have ever read. I don't understand how it could hold anyone's attention, especially with our face-paced society the way it is. Interesting historically, but I did not enjoy it."
5,BEST book ever,This is my new favorite book and usually I don't even like to read. It kept me interested and I never knew what was going to happen next. I just wish I could unread it so I could experience it all over again!
3,Romantic...,It is a pretty good book not the best. It is a little slow for me though. It discribes imagines and scences very well. It is romantic but there really isn't a good story line. I would read another book. But this book isn't horrible. its just ok.
3,the good and bad,"I loved this story I thought it was a good book with a plot line that everyone could understand and relate to. What I did not like was the vagueness of the book. In some parts it would never say ""they kissed"" or ""she broke up with him"" it would just kind of end or tries to describe it using weird metaphors that made no sense. I think in other scenes of the book and less important ones their was too much description and made u lose the story. So I loved the plotline and idea but the way it was carried out was not the best."
1,Not at all like the picture.,"I ordered these light fixtures thinking that they were pretty. I was very disappointed when I opened the box. Not only was the color off but they also look cheaply made. If your looking for oil rubbed bronze, you will be disappointed. I sent these back."
5,A classic of South American literature,"El Tunel (The Tunnel) is a great novel written in that unique, surreal, style typical of many great South American authors. I've read it several times and never get bored with it. It's worth learning Spanish just to read this book. It's a definite must for anyone who is interested in Spanish and the culture of South America."
1,Spam needed?,"I recently received SPAM advertising this book. I do not know if it is just faked to make me believe it has been sent by the author of this book, i.e. somebody wants to harm the author by distributing SPAM in his name, or if the author thinks his book needs a push. Anyway, reason enough for me not to buy it."
3,"A commentary, not a translation","This work is intended by the author to contain the authoritative Jewish interpretation of the Torah, by including the rabbinic readings which guide Jewish law. However, the author is actually changing the traditional Jewish approach which distinguishes between the Oral Law and the Written Law. By ""translating"" the rabbinic rulings into the text , Kaplan perhaps did a service to Jews who just ""want the bottom line"" but obliterates some of the complexity and profundity of the Jewish tradition, in which what literally says A is actually applied as though it said B"
5,You are trusting your life to what you are wearing,"When I was riding Motorcycles many years ago and rode about twenty years or about 200,000 mile, I was using a Bell Helmet. You are trusting your life to what you are wearing. When I though I want to get a bicycle to partly relive my motorcycle days and partly for local transportation, I got a Bell bicycle helmet again. As usual the quality is very good. The color is molded in the plastic and you can adjust the liner inside the helmet with spare pad that come with it. The only thing I didn't like is the fact that Amazon dose not carry this type of helmet in a large white (I got a plane black one). Once you get the helmet adjusted to fit you head, you hardly know you are wearing it."
4,Great helmet,"The helmet is great. I looked at a few others while shopping for one and this one won out on price, comfort and safety. The only thing that annoys me is the ""Bell"" on front of the helmet but a sticker will take care of that."
5,Even in cuter in person!,"I was excited for this helmet because it doesn't make you look dorky - it's even cuter in person! What I LOVED about this helmet is the comfort and the fact it comes with interchangeable cushion/padding in it so you can get the PERFECT fit! I would recommend this helmet to ANYONE! It's just perfect and well worth the money!This was purchased on Amazon and surprisingly, they shipped to Canada! Shipping was very quick and I am very pleased with that as well."
3,seems safe but it's bulky,"looks kinda dumb. it's so huge an bulky. the shape is nice but the inner styrofoam layer is like an inch, plus the padding. You'll look like a ""charity case."""
4,This helmet is almost too cool looking to wear...,"I never cared much for the foam ""Ice Cooler"" type helmets and have only worn hard shell type helmets in the past.. I have been purchasing parts and accessories for an old beach cruiser I am putting a 35.5 cc motor kit on here at Amazon and found a good deal on this helmet and had to have it... I wear a size 7 3/8 hat and found that this large size helmet fit me perfectly right out of the box... If it hadn't there wouldn't have been any problem since it comes with thicker and thinner pads with hook and loop fasteners to be used for adjusting for a looser or tighter fit.. A plain helmet without the wild graphics are available at the local WallyWorld for a few dollars more but I hate going into the place... Once again I have gotten what I needed at a decent price on Amazon... It's become a habit but not a bad one."
2,I am 14 but not a user...anyway,Iommi is being disgraced when playing with Hughs Iommi and Osbourne is the real way to do it I think this album is ok so I give it a 2 dont buy this get Black Sabbath-Paranoid...thats if you want to hear Iommi at his best
2,Very short meditation overviews,This is an extremely brief overview of various meditations. I was expecting five guided meditations that would be about 20 minutes each. If you just want the overview then this is a great place to start but I would look for your meditations in other places.
3,The Book of Happiness,"This has been the first time that I ventured in the writtings of Nina Berberova. She has a haunting style and is a skilled narrator. The only problem remains in the heart of the matter, to say: is it interesting what she is narrating? Not to me. Such a masterfulness, what for? I don't find interesting the substance, or better: there is no substance at all. It is vague, ambigüous and nothing more. But, of course that ambigüosness is treated masterfully. So nothing for an Ah! really. You will remember the book for its style and you will not even remember what it was about, because there is nothing to remember really.It is a good lecture for an afternoon in a peaceful summer vacation."
1,This soundtrack is an Omen,"This must be one of Goldsimth's worst score ever, from my point of view. And if you think it's a bad score you are so right. Who wants to listen to terrifying music that makes you pee in your pants! . The thing I hate the most is ""Ave Satani"" I am always a Goldsimth fan, but this is the worst he's done. Buy something else, please. Try Along came a sipder or the mummy NOT this!. I only gave this CD one star because had too."
5,Fourth in the Green Knowe series,"Ping, one of the refugee children from the River at Green Knowe, returns to spend the summer with Tolly's grandmother at Green Knowe, as Tolly is on a vacation with his parents. Ida has written to Mrs. Oldknow, asking her to ask Ping to stay. The adventures this time center on an escaped gorilla who comes to stay in Toseland Thicket -- a tangle of woods across the moat from the Green Knowe garden. Also a wonderful book. Imaginative and sensitive and mysterious."
4,Director did a much better job with this installment,"This installment of the Twilight Saga was a vast improvement technically over the first installment. This director used much better, studio quality special effects, lighting choices, and overall editing."
5,for granddaughter,"Was very pleased with the price of this product, especia;;y since it also came with a necklace. could not believe how quickly we received this product. Granddaughter truly loved her gift"
1,even worse than twilight!,"The movie was hard to sit through. The acting and plot were so terrible and contrived that I found it impossible to enjoy anything. it was frustrating seeing Bella pine in her room for months after Edward ended their relationship. She should just have chosen Jacob and stuck with him, he was far better boyfriend material then Edward. he was a thoughtful and nice guy, and unlike Edward, he wasn't some sparkly pretty boy with a head of perpetually messy hair. This movie was even worse than Twilight. Some of the scenes had Bella staring off with some wistful expression almost as if she would cry, it was so terrible. Some of the camerawork and cuts done for scenes were just horrible and contrived. I didn't think it was possible to make a movie worse than Twilight, but I guess the producers sure proved me wrong!"
5,2nd time is the key,"The 2-disc set of Twilight: New Moon is well worth the price. The acting is much more natural and believable than the first film, Twilight. There is more chemistry between the actors, and more of the book is evident. Am anxious for the 3rd in the series to come on the market."
3,WARNING: Not All Extras Included!!!,"WARNING: This edition DOES NOT contain all the special features available with the New Moon release. Summit did an evil, evil, manipulative thing with this DVD release and divided up the special features among multiple retailers.On Amazon you have just the standard discs with a limited number of extras.If you buy your version at Target, you get an extra disc with Deleted Scenes, Interview with the Volturi, Fandimonium, The Beat Goes On: The Music of Twilight, and Frame by Frame: Storyboards to Screen.If you buy at Borders, you get extras including Extended Scenes.And if you buy at Walmart, you get a Sneak Peek at Eclipse (which includes an Eclipse scene), Team Edward v. Team Jacob, Becoming Jacob, Introducing the Wolfpack, Jacob Fast Forward, Edward Fast Forward, and Shooting in Italy.Summit's hoping you buy THREE copies so that you can get to see all the special features they divided up. Don't give them the satisfaction! Buy one and call it a day!"
1,very misleading,I was sad so see the version I received was a French copy. The movie is still in English but it's not what is being advertised. The only reason I have not returned the item is because it took so long to arrive in the first place
5,TWILIGHT SAGA,"I DID PURCHASE THIS ITEM, IT IS A VERY GOOD ENTERTAINING SET . I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO LIKES LOVE STORIES."
3,Great movie. Special features lacking on DVD,"I am sooooo disappointed in the special features section. All you get for special features on the Amazon version is a 6 part documentary on making and a director's commentary. There are not even any deleted scenes!!!! Then to find out that Target, Walmart, Barnes & Noble and Blockbuster and who knows else have different versions with more special features just makes me mad. If this is the best Amazon can do then I am NOT impressed. The movies itself is great. If that is all you are buying for then this is definately the ""no frills"" package. Not at all what I was after."
4,NO EXTRAS ON THESE 2 DISC,"When I originally pre-ordered this movie I was under the impression that there would be a disc that included deleted and extended scenes like ""Twilight Movie"". Was I sadly mistaken. Summit, at the last minute changed everything so that lovers of this movie would buy more than one copy to get what they wanted. That is so dirty in my opinion. Guess they figured they could get away with it because any true Twilight Saga lover wants a copy of the movies a.s.a.p. and Summit took advantage of that.My advice is to just shop around and make sure you get the disc set that has the extra features you want.Love the movie but really didn't care for the 2nd disc. I haven't even watched it because nothing on it appeals to me. Would've loved to had deleted and extended scenes but can't afford to buy a 2nd copy right now.Hope this review has helped someone."
3,Where is the extras?,This is not a review of the movie. I bought this for my wife who is a huge fan. Pre-ordered it and everything. So image my disappointment when when she was disappointed due to the lack of deleted scenes and other extra's that she expected to have on a Blu-ray. Buy another version if that is important too you.
5,The Twilight Saga,This was apurchase for Christmas to add to the other series of movies and books. My daughter loves it a lot.
3,OK,I never really liked the movies all that much. I find them really boring with the only good part of them being the werewolves. Too bad in these movies they are made super weak next to vampires. You would think they would be immune to their powers to make up for their suckiness.
2,"Sorry, boring.","I wanted to watch the series because I really enjoyed the 1st and would like to see the finalies, but it was not interesting."
2,Slow,"A movie this slow doesn't deserve to be called a ""movie"" but whoever heard of a ""slowie""? I had hoped to like the series but it fell flat."
5,Love the movie and love the sneak preview from Amazon!,"I pre-ordered this movie from Amazon and the night it was released, I got an email link to watch it on my computer while the actual dvd was being shipped to my house! It was awesome! So I still got to watch it as soon as it was available on dvd - just on my computer and my dvd came in the mail a few days later. LOVE IT!"
5,Great!,"My wife purchased this movie and I watched it with her. I thought the entire movie was great! She read all the books and I did not, however, I did enjoy the movie and she helped me a bit with the plot."
1,The Twilight Saga: New Moon (Blue -ray),"I purchased New Moon and Avatar, both blue ray. When we received the DVD's we put them into our blue ray playstation 3 to play them. Avatar plays beautifully and we are very happy. New moon on the otherhand won't play at all. We get a message that says it is incorrectly formatted. Is it possible we have been sent the wrong region disc. We are in Australia"
3,"Better than the last ""Twilight""","Thank god they dumped that gushing female who directed the last one. Chris Weitz did a much better job though per usual Bella and Edward talked like they had brain freeze between every four words and the accompanying grimmaces. Jake and the wolf pack were great, ditto Volturi.Music per usual was garbage and why they think the age group they are targeting for these movies demands someone yodeling some gawdawful song every scene is a mystery."
2,TEEN MOVIE,"TEEN MOVIE, BAD ACTING , WOLVES ARE BAD, NO PASSION BETWEEN BELLA AND EDWARD, RENT THIS MOVIE DONT BUY IT NEW ANYWAY."
3,Never Received!,This item has never been received. I emailed the seller but no response yet as I just sent it this week.
5,"I loved the movie, but when I watched it my Kindle kept buffering the scenes","I rented New Moon because I had not watched it yet and I wanted to catch up before I watch the last two movies. The only issue I had was that my kindle kept buffering the scenes and kept freezing up. My battery was fully charged before I started the movie. A two hour movie took almost three hours to watch because I kept having to go back and re-watch the scenes to unfreeze them. What is the deal? Again nothing wrong with the movie, just didn't like the experience of watching it on my Kindle."
5,a must bye,"the blue ray dvd was perfect, and the characters so believable and the special effects at the end amazing, good cliff hanger"
5,The Twilight Saga: New Moon,"I loved the books, I love the movie and all the Cullen family! What more can I say?"
4,A really good movie,"I have read the book that this movie was based upon and I thought that the movie was better than the book. This film has it all romance, angst, a love triangle and plenty of action. I love films that force me to suspend reality and really believe, for a little while, that actions and events could occur in real life! This film is for die hard Twilight Saga Fans!!!"
1,crap,do u know what all the stars in twilight have in common they can not act if there life depended on it. believe me every one. in vampire movie there has to be blood hunger. in these there is none it is just about a girl going from 1 to the other. what a SLUT.
4,cant wait for eclipse!,although i wouild say the acting isnt amazing...i do love these movies. i have also read all of the books so that is 97% of the reason why i love the movies. the other 3% is because i think robert pattinson is very good looking haha. oh and jacob of course!
1,Unhappy,I recieved this Blu-ray DVD and it wouldn't play the movie itself...played all the stupid previews etc. but the movie was sound and no picture and before you ask ...yes I do have a New Samsung Blu-ray DVD player and it plays all the others just fine...so unhappy. I had friends over to watch it....ugh
1,Yawnfest. The book still rocks though.,"This movie was terrible. The acting was bad, and I can't understand how anyone who read the book could actually like this. I feel like a lot of fans of the book support it blindly just so they can keep making more movies. I loved the book, but i can't support these films. I hate the films thus far. Why do fans accept mediocrity?"
3,It's Just Alright,"I have read the Twilight Saga and fell in love with the books. However, the movies leave something to be desired. I personally liked Twilight better, some of the acting just seemed off to me in New Moon. With this being said, New Moon was my least favorite book in the series so this may be why I didn't like the movie as much. I have not gotten the chance to watch any of the extra things on the disk so I can't say if it's good or bad. I would have to say the best thing about the movies are that they picked good looking people and I think that is what pulls a lot of the watchers in!"
4,"Neat toy, some pieces hard to put together and take apart","My children (4,4,3) really like this toy. They spend a lot of time with it but they do run into problems when trying to take some of the pieces apart."
3,Fun toy hard to set up,Th bases for this toy are very hard to put together. My children (ages 4 and 6) are unable to do it independently. They enjoy the gears and can easily put them together.
4,Good purchase and educational as well.,This toy really works well and it teaches children the basics of gear mechanics. My child's school has this exact set and all the kids in his class love it.
3,Not much of a building toy,"Some design shortfalls taint an otherwise wonderful idea. For one, the 6-way connectors create a practically permanent bond. I had to bring out the pliers to pull them apart - not a good thing for a two-and-a-half year old to try. Second, the design does not allow for up and over gear spinning. You can connect the horizontal gears on the green ""floor plates"" to a vertical column. You can also place the gears on top of the vertical column but it doesn't connect to the rest of the column so it won't spin. The picture on the box is somewhat misleading. If you try to build those designs, you immediately see not all the gears move. Third, there are not enough floor plates so it limits what you can build. But then again, this is the only gear set I could find."
5,Awesome!,Great for any little boy or girl. Keeps my kids really busy! So many different ways to build the gears and lets them be creative! My son is 4 and my daughter is 2.5 years old and they play well together with the gears. Check around for pricing because some stores are expensive:)
4,A Nice Getaway...,"Whenever I listen to 'Island Paradise' I am enchanted by the sound of the island surf, instrumentals and birds--I feel as if I'm on the island of Trinidad, absorbing the scenery and scent of the Earth and Water.What makes this album so interesting is that there's a beautiful storm that takes up 3 tracks--when you imagine yourself the observer of a thunder and rain show...with the accompaniments of bamboo crackling, winds howling, and the surf pounding.Far from being altogether disruptive, the storm regenerates you and heals you--as much as it causes the land to regenerate and sprout green anew.Why I give this album a ""4"" is because, while it is not the best album I've ever listened to, it is worth listening to for the experience of venturing into an island paradise--storm and all."
2,Kindle Version of Lonely Planet Bolivia,"In my understanding the use of a guide book is to help you orient yourself in an unknown surrounding with ease (and help you stay safe). Sadly, the maps do not work in the kindle version... they are too small to read and it is NOT possible to zoom in further, making an important part of this document obsolete. The ""sleep"", ""eat"" and ""get around"" sections of the book are useful some of the time although I have found the internet to be a more helpful resource.Two stars (instead of three) for the bad maps. Three stars because I find this LP guidebook (as all the others) impossibly dull to read and only semi-useful."
5,Information galore!,"An excellent resource for location, history and facts about lighthouses for the beginning student or the masters of the lighthouse!"
3,"OK book, priced for tourists","Ralph's Italian Restaurant book is OK read, but better @ a non-tourist price. Recipes not much more than basic stuff.It was a quick read, then on shelf or to good will."
3,"A good read, but not life altering","Moore makes Buddhism more accessible than any other book I've approached on the subject. I appreciate his research and frustration, his willingness to put himself out there. Unfortunately, it was a little bland. The reviews here on Amazon built the book up a lot. I liked it but wasn't blown away. Inspiring, nonetheless."
4,"Good read, an American journey into Buddhism","I enjoyed reading this book. It was the story of a Catholic visiting the Theravada, Tibetan, and Zen schools of Buddhism. He was going to write a book about American Buddhism but ended up as a Buddhist himself.I am a beginning Buddhist and learned a lot from this book. If you are looking for a fellow traveler into beginning Buddhism this is your guy."
3,Finding one's own identity,"A young couple of Algerian descent lives in Paris. One day, on the whim they decide to go to Algeria, on foot. In the course of the film we learn that young man's parents were killed in a car accedent when he was a child. Young woman's father was married to a French woman and never thought his daughter to speak Algerian. Both of these young people are damaged. But there weaknesses make them perfect for each other. On their trip through Spain, they meet brother and sister from Algeria who are on their way to Paris to find work. To them it is incomprehensible why these two lovers speak no language of their ancestry and why they are going into a place both brother and sister are trying to escape from.It is an interesting film about self-discovery, sexual awakening, national identity and spirituality strapped from religion. Differences in all its absurdity: language, the way we dress, interact with each other and treat each other."
1,I hated this film,"I got this from the library because I've always liked films with the actor Romain Duris. But I'm disappointed that he made this movie. The cover synopsis mentioned a great soundtrack and beautiful scenery, and I would have to disagree with both counts (see Himalaya if you want beautiful scenery). The story was as aimless as the two characters, who I never connected with, especially the woman. There was nothing for me to like about her - it seemed like the film went out of its way to make her look a mess and her inner self was also a mess. The wandering culminates in a long, unpleasant, loud, annoying frenetic dance that went on FAR too long. I was relieved when that scene, and the entire movie, was over. I can't say enough how stupid I thought this was. Watch L'Auberge Espagnole, Les Poupees Russes, or other Romain Duris films, but skip this one."
2,Did not portray the James Herriot that I had in my mind,"I was dissapointed in this book. Herriot could make you see a visual as you read his stories, whether true or fiction they were great. Graham Lord just sort of let the air out of the baloon."
3,SOPHISTRY,"Enjoyable read however, technically flawed, specifically the ending. It wraps up much too neatly, particulary the bizarre acceptance of the murderer's incorrigible behavior by Sorme, but particularly Gertrude. Her response to Sorme as well as her reaction to the truth is completely out of character.If you enjoy character development and philosphical discourse in layman's terms, you will appreciate this work. The plot however, is weak and slow moving. I actually like that aspect of it."
3,Short Game,"This game was fun to play but way too short...If you are a fan of DBZ then you will like this game as I did...between losing lives, attempting to gain all the powerups and such in the game, it took about 4 hours to beat...this game spans from Raditz to Cell sagas...they lack alot of details from the show causing the game to be really short and easy...it's a decent game for $20 but I wouldn't recommend paying more..."
2,WHAT HAPPENED,Man I don't know what happened I've been watching dragonballz and playing the games for ages and liked all of them.But this game is just plain stupid.It looked all tight on the comercials but all their doing is just taking images from the dragonballz cartoons and putting them on the game.They shoudl've used their own gameplay for the story line instead of using the cartoon.The gameplay SUCKS.The only people you win on their is broly and bardock and the rest of them is in different costumes.They should just stick to dragonballz budokai.
4,Good stuff and Bad stuff,"All Right, this game is fun. You don't have to agree with me but this game is like a DBZ version of Kingdom hearts, you walk around kill people. It is easy though, it took me a day to beat it. It starts out with Raditz and ends with the Gohan vs Cell fight. In a way its like budokai one. The two player action makes it even better. I give the grafics a 3.5 out of five for effort, their not TOO bad but they could have done better. So if your a DBZ fan, get this game, if you don't like DBZ but like VG's still buy this game. If you hate DBZ and everything about or don't like VG's, dont get this game."
2,Quite boring........,"This has to be the worst DBZ game in the past 3 years.Believe me if you are thinking of getting a DBZ game then get Budokai 2 or 3 which are really way,way better.This game is really too easy to beat(I finished it in 2 days)and it's not worth the money.The gameplay is definitely not what I expect and the graphics really are pathetic and definitely not upto the standard."
3,Hell No!,Trully this game does not live up to the name Sagas.It skips pretty much all the details the sagas really should have.The game is fun.It really is.BUT i beat the whole dame game within 2 hours.Pak man gave me more of a challenge.The graphic are alright.I didnt expect them to be great.Over all i regret paying what i did for the game.It's best to get the game used so the most you have to pay is ten bucks.Thats how much i sold mine.
2,Snow Miser: Yeah Without a Santa Claus,The look of the toys are awesome but there are problems with some of the toys being able to stand on their own. Snow Miser and his two little friends who look like him are unable to stand on their own. Plus Snow Miser leans too far making it very difficult to make him stand at all. I suggest leaving them in the box or finding something to put under their feet. Especially Snow Miser.
3,Interlink Navigator prone to interference,"Good product for the most part, however on two occasions the Presenter quit functioning in the middle of slide shows due to RF interference. We are looking at the 2.5 ghz model in the hopes that will be less prone to stray RFI. Next show we will have both an IR and a RF remote."
1,Point of error,"Point of Terror (1971) is a vomit throw back from way, way back.This movie bored the living hell out of me when I first saw it. I couldn't even go into the bathroom for a week without vomiting it out thoroughly.The villain is just boring and dull, played with bad intentions by Dyanne ""Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS"" Thorne but failing to incite any kind of terror or fear after you realize she doesn't even kill that many people and barely does anything besides have a pool nude scene (surprisingly good).This is a strong candidate in the most boring movie I've ever seen category.The story says nothing of terror; so the plot falls apart as soon as the blond Dyanne ""Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS"" Thorne becomes a suspect."
1,why people keep complaining,well for starters this sword is way over priced it use to be like $20 at Wal-Mart so it shouldn't be almost $80. Now for the adults that buy it for themselves stop acting like cry babies this is a childs toy if u want one then look for an adult one simple as that.
4,Great surreal drama,"Along with Deep End and Moonlighting, this is one of Jerzy Skolimowski's best films. Starting with a cricket game at a British mental institution, it moves back in time to tell the story of a strange drifter, played by Alan Bates, who comes upon the home of a young couple. The wife, pretty Susannah York, is intrigued with the handsome drifter; complications arise.But this is not the standard love triangle story at all. Bates' character claims to have a bizarre ability which should not be revealed here--which he learned while adrift in the Australian outback for several years. The final revelation of this ability and its consequences are a powerful climax to a riveting film that effectively puts the tale of the outsider in a startling context. The tension here is subtle and strong, giving this film a momentum that holds the viewer captive, just as Bates' character himself holds the couple psychological captives.Highly recommended; deserves much wider recognition."
2,Just OK,"I can't believe all the 5 star reviews of this cd. It is a strictly average rock album. It opens strongly for the first 5 miniutes and then just kinds of rocks along with no real peak. There are very nice parts on the cd but these are usually short and stopped with singing or pounding hard rock parts. My main problem with the cd is that good prog rock has complex and interesting instrumental passages and interplay among the musicians and this release lacks that. Bottom line is there is just too much singing on this one. The first Transatlantic is a gem but this one just doesn't go anywhere. Don't buy this one until you have the first Transatlantic, all of the Flower Kings and V and Darkness by Spocks Beard."
1,There is no 21`st century Yes,"After classic 70`s (Yes, Crimson, Genesis, Floyd etc.)this one sounds like .......you know what classic music made after Mozart,Beethoven etc. is .......So, please don`t hype it.......Fine print: Even worst Yes, Floyd etc. is way better than any new neo - prog bands best CD."
3,"Good music, however Morse isn't my favorite singer","I could never get into Neal Morse's voice. I like the Swedish guitarist's voice, Roine Stolt, much more. I also didn't like the title track; corny, and once again the vocals are all Morse. The rest of the songs are crafted pleasantly but nothing really outstanding. This album shouldn't be taken too seriously, the members of transatlantic should be proud that they were willing to try something new, but I think they should stick to their respective bands."
5,Great!!!,"Great addition the Thomas Wooden Railway collection. It was a much needed addition, as tracks do not always match up when building a route."
3,too much of a good thing?,"Owning this album is like having a pound of nutmeg in the cabinet; it's nice enough, but you don't use it all at once. It makes a good mix-in, though. (I was disappointed that it didn't have ""Coridinio"", which I still think is her best.)"
3,Jung: Interpreting your Dreams,"In this book, Author James A. Hall attempts to explain some of the key concepts of Jungian dream interpretation. I felt that he did an adequate job, with perhaps a bit too much emphasis on the history of Jung and Freud, and not enough insight as to dream interpretation. He did, however, explain the best way to determine what the symbols and motifs of dreams mean to you as an individual, as opposed to blatantly claiming, ""dreaming of a snake means loss of control"". I felt that, all and all, anyone wishing to learn propper dream interpretation could benefit from this book."
4,"Nice, simple tea biscuits","These are very basic, slightly bland little tea cracker-cookies. You can eat them as is or dress them up with some peanut butter and jam or that evil, addictive Nutella spread. A perfect little go-to snack when you don't want to commit to a full breakfast or lunch.These came well packaged and no broken cookies.Definitely will buy again!"
2,Caveat Emptor!,"Two (2) stars for the product but ZERO for the vendor, who sold us an expired item. Just a word to the wise consumer: Always double-check expiration dates for such products, but ESPECIALLY with THDV. We would not purchase from them again."
1,Clouds in freezer,"Product clouded in freezer, and largely solidified, as did another common product.Pharmaceutical grade product (prescription) remained unclouded, and flowed freely.Draw your own conclusions / do you own testing.There seems to be only one over-the-counter brand that doesn't cloud.This may still be a good product and good value."
3,Power Failure After 9 months,"I purchased this drive 9 months ago and used it every couple of weeks for backups -- in my opinion, light use. Last week, it failed to respond when I hit the start button. I called WD Tech Support (Level 2) and they immediately sent me a new power cord, hoping that would solve the problem. It didn't, and they offered to replace the drive immediately.I consider the service commendable but the equipment marginal."
3,"So far, so good","I have a WD Passport 120 GB that has worked well for about a year, but is too small for all the video files. This drive is huge, but I will keep a backup of my most important files, and hardest to replace, at least for the near term. I have had a couple issues using this with my laptop, a Dell Lat D800, which is a few years old. If I have this drive and the passport plugged in at the same time, I get a write failure and the files on My Book won't open. This didn't happen on a newer laptop I borrowed to copy the files over. It is a little slow to read files at times and is noisier than I expected."
3,"I give it 3 stars, and i'm being generous","Apparently Galactic Cowboys are one of those bands you either like or not so much. I happen to fall on the not so much side of the fence. While these guys did have a unique sound, they didn't really have much else.I'm not trying to poo poo on these guys. I honestly tried to like this record, it just seemed the more I listened, the worse it got. I mean, are these guys thrash? Are they Metal? I couldn't figure it out. For everybody who gave this album five-stars, God bless ya for it, I certainly didn't hear anything remotely close to five-stars, but to each their own. While I won't be buying any other of Galactic Cowboys records, a couple songs did stick out to me. ""If I Were A Killer"", ""I Do What I Do"", and ""You Make Me Smile"" were all decent enough.This is one of those hear it for yourself bands. You may love them, or you may want to cut your ears off after hearing them."
4,Showcasing composer's orginal thoughts,"Control, grace, precision, bravura, artistic freedom, are some of the words I would describe FK's interpretation of his repretiore he chooses to showcase. I find this CD with most of his other recordings to focus the orginal's composer's wishes rather highlighting the showmanship. It is refreshing to hear an instrumentalist's reservations of being indulgent."
1,Does not compare to Cuisinart,"Well, after 2 years of use I have ordered a Cuisinart w/pour spout to replace this Revere. I have only used this to boil water/milk every morning for cafe au lait (using a French press, n.o. style) and the bottom is brown and it is a real pain to clean, sticks horribly, I hate it. My Cuisinart non-stick purchased at the same time is still flawless. Now that Cuisinart comes with pour spouts, don't waste your time with this. It will not last. It is not an investment. I got a Cuisinart w/pour spout to replace this and it is wonderfully easy to clean up."
3,Didn't like the toe part,These sandals were comfortable enough as far as the sole but the portion that encloses your big toe felt like it was bearing down on the top of my toe. It was a bit uncomfortable and I didn't like feeling constantly aware of that while I was wearing them. I returned the sandals.
2,Nice looking but.....,"much larger than they appear in picture. I returned this product. Vendor, by the way, was great to deal with."
4,This CD proves to Rock fans that they can like Country also,"Rock-a-billy/blue grass twang rock with an alt pop sensibility.If you have a rock fan who thinks they could never like country music, this is the disc to prove them wrong. Great songs from the 1st cut to the last.Sure, hard core Old 97s fans think this is too commercial -- but if it turns you on to their great music (Too Far to Care, Wreck Your Life, Hitchhike To Rhome) then who cares?Old 97s vocalist Rhett Miller's also released a solo effort (The Instigator); The single -- Come Around -- was on an episode of Scrubs."
5,A fantastic album!,"This is what rock and roll is supposed to be! Old 97's bring a freshness and a spirit back that has all but vanished from today's fragmented and compartmentalized music scene. ""Satellite Rides"" is a FUN record! It showcases straight-ahead guitar rock and roll with elements of country and punk.I'm finding it hard to find a band to compare Old 97s to; maybe you could say they sound like Squeeze meets the Plimsouls meets early Tom Petty meets Elvis Costello meets Johnny Cash. But then again, why compare them to anyone? ""Satellite Rides"" is a fantastic disc that offers clever, insightful lyrics and catchy, danceable tunes. Listening to the songs, they instantly sound both familiar and new.Highly recommended!"
3,Some people are confused,"People are confused. This isn't the wonderful Rene LaLoux animated French film called ""Light Years"" in America. This is a film directed by Alain Tanner. I'm not sure much about it."
4,Creating Your Perfect Quilting Space,"Enjoyed the book and the pictures, which are worth a thousand words. The prices for doing these rooms, however, can be reduced with some thought and the thrift stores."
4,love it.,"I reallly enjoyed this album, a lot. I like this album because it kinda has a bluesy, old school vibe that you can kinda nod your head to and kinda dance to. My favorite song would have to be Take a Look at That Guy. It's very catchy and I just wanna dance around my room to this. The song I liked least would probably be Pressure Drop, this sounds kinda bothers me. not quite sure why...I think Izzy should be appreciated for more things besides the fact that he was a rhythm guitarist in Guns N' Roses."
1,bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i woke up next to this thing and hide in the basement for 9 hours
1,Out-dated,"With the corporate legal framework in China changing so rapidly, I am afraid that this book is now already hopelessly out of date. Do beware when reading and one has to check and see if things have been changed."
3,It's Ok,"I had heard nothing of this movie before I bought it. It's just ok. I was hoping for more. But some reviews I saw after I bought it, said that Franco and Isolde (not sure who she was) did not have chemistry. This seems to hold true. If you like this one, you'd really like King Arthur. Funny enough, it has Rufus Sewell same as this movie."
1,Pile of suck.,"This movie was boring. Gouge-my-eyes-out boring. Please-stop-the-pain boring. Make-it-end boring. Until the very end, when our hero manages to survive for half an hour after having his heart bisected by a broadsword. But, never fear, the boredom continues for a good ten minutes afterward. If your wife tries to tell you this is like ""Braveheart"", tell her, ""Look, honey, I rented Braveheart!"" Then you can both avoid the pain of her dirty, dirty lies. Baby arm."
4,Pretty and Worth Watching,"The film ""Tristan and Isolde"" combines aspects from the variations of the original folktale to present a story that is appealing at this day in age. The beautiful cinematography (except the annoying letters against the blue screen-- can't read those!) and rich costuming will appeal to any film enthusiast. The romance and plot may appeal most to adolescents, because they are characteristically likely to share the lovers' impulsiveness and passion. But anyone who has ever been in love will appreciate this story. I find it is a film that improves with each viewing."
4,The Lovelorns.,"Tristan and Isolde was quite beautiful to watch. The love story between the two is intense and heartbreaking. The stars of the film, James Franco and Sophia Mlyes did a wonderful job as the star-crossed lovers. This story screams Romeo and Juilet but this movie does have a mind of its own. Isolde is forced to marry Tristan's primary guardian and of course Isolde sneaks out in the middle of the night to join Tristan for a mid-night romp, a snitch notices their closeness during the day and tells Isolde's husband. As you can expect tradegy befalls one of them but still this movie is so much better than i thought it would be, I recommend checking this love story for all ages out."
1,worst movie ever,"It was terrible. Tristan was the greatest fighter around and had the most melancholy spirit. He spent most of the movie morose and scowling. yes, his family died, but EVERYONE'S family died at the beginning. as for Isolde, she she had an opportunity to not marry King Mark-when she first met him she could have been honest with him-, but she married him anyway, and then started sleeping around behind his back. i cant feel any sympathy for her because she chose to marry someone other than Tristan and then she chose to cheat and then she chose to run away from her problems which screwed up everyone else's lives."
5,"A love story, but so much more.","This movie is for those of us who still enjoy a great love story. For those of us who know love, have experienced it and understand it, even if we've lost it. However, this movie is so much more than a love story, with the history of war between Ireland and England. Its a complete package, beautifully done."
1,Disappointed ~ Rufus Sewall is the only Exception,"Boring, contrived, predictable and over-dressed for the poor writing. Romantic?? 'Getting it on' love scenes do not equate to romance. There is no subtle tension, no evolution, no surprise, and no chemistry whatsoever between Tristan and Isolde. They were not believeable or interesting together for one moment. I thought there was much more of a touch of romance and chemistry between Isolde and Lord Marc. I had to fast forward thru the over-gory fight scenes as I think much of the graphic violence serves as filler to make up for uninteresting dialogue and plot. I do not like the vacant, boyish, brooding Tristan; wrong casting choice there. The Isolde actor is unremarkable paired up with him. There is some good photography, but it does not compensate for the unengaging story. My one good comment is Rufus Sewall is very good; every scene he is in is a momentary relief from it's dullness."
4,Donna Richardson - 3 Day Rotation 2000,"This is a great motivational workout. The 3 segments keep you from getting bored. And when you're ready for a challenge there's the advanced version, which can be tricky. There's lots of fast footwork on the dance segment. The workout's are also fun... a plus! The kick-boxing segment has some quick moves...so if you don't know a jab from an upper-cut you might want to study up!"
5,The only workout I ever stuck to!,"Donna is my new best friend. She is so encouraging and perky, unlike some of the fake fitness gurus out there. She makes things fun, does some moves that are silly but fun. It does take a few times of doing the workout to really be able to keep up, but its just a small challenge, and worth it."
3,Fast Paced,"This is my first (and maybe last) Donna Richardson workout that I'll purchase. Donna does an excellent job at providing viewers with a complete body training program. With the 3 day rotation, viewers will receive a high energy cardio and strength training workout.I personally found the pace to be too fast and it took too long for me to learn the routine. I spent more time trying to learn the steps than focusing on the workout."
2,Just okay,"I don't know what it is exactly, but I just don't like this DVD. I mean, it isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't great. I have a few workout DVDs and haven't even used this one in months. There are a LOT better out there so I recommend getting something else. The workouts on this DVD are okay but nothing special and not very physically challenging. Ms. Richardson and her backup people are very irritating and overly perky. She says ""I got your back"" every two minutes."
2,Lame,"I didn't like this at all. Donna is like the cheerleader you hated in high school. I'm sure I got something out of the workout, but not much."
4,Great Cardio Workout,"Great cardio workout, but not for beginners who have no coordination. This DVD is good, but it does not offer a lot of introduction to knew moves. Also, the moves are executed too quickly and are not done for a long period of time. But I love the intensity. It really worked me through which is my goal. If I didn't get a move, I just kept moving. Overall, with more introduction and training of techniques prior to workout, this would be an excellent workout DVD."
4,I really like this DVD!,"This is a fun workout. I really like the fact that it's broken down into 3 20 minute sessions. I really like the circuit toning and the Kick and Jab sessions. The Kick and Jab session is a lot of fun, which makes me want to do it often. The Dance Aerobics has a lot of fast moves that I haven't quite picked up on yet, but the instructor cam makes learning all of the moves easier. Donna is very motivating and fun to listen to. The only complaint I have is that she says ""I've got your back"" way too much, but all in all she's very energetic and doesn't grate on your nerves.Another good feature is that once you've platued with the first workout she has a more advanced workout that seems very challenging. I would recommend this DVD for anyone who wants a workout that won't get boring quick."
2,Didn't Like It,I love Donna's book Let's Get Real but I just can't get into her workouts. I didn't find the workouts fun or motivating. Save your money.
2,Not Worth It,"I'm fat and relatively out of shape, and this video was so easy I think I actually yawned during one of the segments. Too much dancing and not enough sustained use of muscles. Donna Richardson's a good instructor, though. Not squeaky or stupid, and she cues well. Maybe her other videos are better."
1,MUTE,"The only way I could view this DVD was on MUTE!.. I can't even tell you what some of the moves were! I gave this DVD to a friend(?) There was too much sister girl stuff going on for me to do the workout. If you like your workout to resemble A NIGHT OUT AT THE NIGHTCLUB, then you will TOLERATE this video."
1,Disappointment,"Given the title ""Holiday Favorites: Christmas Soul"" I thought this CD would have added to my classic collection. However, this is not to be. The recordings were poor for the most part. I really hope that there will be better collections out there come xmas 2007."
4,Beautifully executed album,Myer's vocals perfectly reflect the emotions in the lyrics. The words themselves are introspective and offer great imagery without becoming cliched or trite.
4,Fab!,"Billie Myers has a somewhat unusual voice and you may find that it takes some getting used to, as did I. Once you do though, the unusual turns into a unique and simply beautiful sound. Myers sings with an untamed passion and every song is addictive. 'You send me flying' is top of the bill, as are 'Kiss the Rain' and 'Tell me'. Step aside from the ordinary and meet a lady with golden voice!"
3,Chick flick with a dumb premise and lacking a clear ending,"I am sorry but I must have had my 3D glasses off, I did not see the depth of thought some of the reviewers eluded to. This was a chick flick, which for a change of pace even men enjoy, but it centered around an absurd premise. It started off very slow and tried to build towards something, but got lost. I did not like the ending, too much info was given so you could not make it end the way ""many/most"" of us believing in true love would have liked. I wish it would have ended with true-love winning out over science. The parts assigned to the actors were somewhere between cold and nasty. Over all the video was interesting but I am glad I rented, I even disliked Michelle Borth hair style when she covered her right eye, it looked unkempt."
4,"""Solid""","If you are a poker player, then this is a good book to read. It has everything you need to become successful. If the book doesn't do it for you, then there is a DVD that could really help your game."
1,Worst effort to date.,"Monster Magnet have truly lost it. I was hoping that they would recover from that abomination God Says No. I was hoping it was just a little hicup and that Monolithic would bring back the sound and energy of the old Monster Magnet. I didn't think it was possible, but Monolithic is even worse than God Says No. It is an insult to their fans. Don't bother."
3,Good Intro to a Dying Movement,"While I found this book very readable and a goodsurvey of ideas from so called systems theory, Ioften wondered to what extent it was a subjectivelyrevised version of what could be more objectivelyportrayed. What I found most telling in this regardwas the fact that although he admits that systemsthinking has died as an academic movement, he failsto mention the significant community of scientists(many of them Nobel prize winners) that havegathered at the Sante Fe Institute to study complexadaptive systems. Capra even very selectivelymentions Kauffman's work without acknowledging thethriving academic community he is involved in(except in one sentence as a kind of afterthought).His intuitive synthesis is interesting but like mostsystems thinking an appealing guess that neverseems to amount to much without the science to backit up."
1,Do not buy this. It is a p.o.s.,"I ordered this product to do some ceiling painting for a property I was about to rent. I covered everything with plastic and tape, including the floors. It arrived, and the knob wouldn't even move. Stuck in place. It was as if it was a prop T.V. set with the knob only painted on. I returned it for a replacement thinking that this must be a fluke. When the new one arrived after the new tenant had already moved in, I opened it right away to make sure it looked alright. (The knob actually turned this time.) So I brought it upstairs (this was in a high rise condo.) I opened my can of paint attatched the nozzle, plugged it in and zip. They sent me another one that was completely dead. It never even tried to work. I bought the Wagner version which was actually quite a bit cheaper. It has worked fine on my last two projects."
1,Taking it to the repair shop.,"At least I got to spray my kitchen and drive gate. I probably have a total of 2 hours on the sprayer. During the cleaning cycle, the sprayer pump decided to stop working. Shortly after, I saw oil dripping form the motor. But I have to say it sprays well when it's working. Thankfully, it is still under warranty (1 year)."
5,Best Hair Product for Me.,"I love this product because it makes my short hairdo so styleable. Also leaves a great shine. Just a little bit rubbed between palms then work through your hair from the roots out and then style your hair however you want, curls, waves, straight, it's great. I've ordered four at a time from Amazon because I can no longer find it at Ulta or Essentials in the mall where I used to by it. I heard it was discontinued. I sure hope not and that I can at least get it on line."
1,very disappointing,it was clear from the beginning of the author's agenda. since she is family she definitely wanted to sanatize his reputation and deeds. she never really got into any of the details of his frontier life and the men he allegedly killed. she spent way too much time about his family and not enough about him in the west.
5,"Review of ""Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait""","I was very impressed with Ms. Tanner's work on Doc. Most peoplethink of Doc as being an assasin but this simply was not the case. Doc obtained his manners in Georgia, as well as his cardplaying ability, and unfortunately TB. Doc was a brilliant manwho proved himself in the world of Dentistry. Ms. Tanner usesa lot of information only she was privy to convey the transitionof this unusual man from being a Georgia Doctor to becoming a""sporting man."" Yes, Doc did kill some people. The times weremuch harsher back then. If you gambled, you better have a sixgun on standby and be ready to use it if a crooked player crawfished a bet and tried to throw down on you. In my view,Ms. Tanner also conveyed one of the most outstanding characteristics about Doc...his loyalty. He proved this time and time again with the Earps. I loved Ms. Tanner's book, and if Docwere still alive, he would be welcome around my campfire anytime."
3,"A fine small historical atlas, but much too pricey","This atlas has very clear pictures and covers most of the important places in world history. For the starting student it is quite helpful. But it shows no changes over time in any map, which the better historical atlases do. And, at 19.95, it is much too expensive. It's often bundled with a textbook, at no extra charge, and that way makes more sense."
5,Perfect for playing out the movie!,"If you are one of those kids that love to play out movies you have seen and liked, well this is the doll for you. I recently earned 200.99 because I gave up all chocolates and sweets for the past 3 years! The first thing I did was buy DOLLS!!! I think it must be a sickness or something, but I ADORE DOLLS!!! I also bought the Mermaidia DVD and I bought this doll to go with it when it was 1/2 price in Woolworths! I like this doll because I can take her and play with her in the sink and then if I just want to pretend she is a normal Barbie again, I detatch her tail. Sometimes I make her a fairy to go with that awesome butterfly Hue!!!Bye!Dolls forever!Barbie!"
5,Another great Clymer manual,"I have generally discovered Clymer manuals are basically as good but at a better price than a factory manual for my motorcycles, and this manual is more of the same high quality and high value I have come to expect."
3,Only okay,"I was pumped when I saw how many reviews talked about getting tangles out.I have fine, thick hair and this just doesn't work very well for me. While it does get the tangles out. it only gets the top layer of hair.If you have thinner fine hair, this brush would probably be really good. For fine, thicker hair, it's just okay."
5,Adele live,"It's Adele, what's not to like? The only problem is it has been ""cleansed"" of some of her colorful language."
5,adele,"Great concert by adele, she has one of the greatest voices around. Bought this for my parents as a gift, and she did not disappoint."
5,Adele Live At The Royal Albert Hall,this is an awesome buy. I love Adele. It is on my bucketlist to see her and this dvd made u feel like you were there. I absolutely loved it.
3,THE FLAVOR OF THE YEAR ... WILL SHE LAST ?,A TALENTED SINGER & PERFORMER ... BUT WILL SHE HAVE STAYING POWER OR BE A FLASH IN THE PAN ?
5,Adele Live At The Royal Albert Hall DVD/CD,Adele Live at Royal Albert Hall DVD/CD is Awesome. I watch it and listen to it over and over. It is a great buy for the money.
5,Outstanding,"I first started listening to Adele about a year ago. I saw this dvd around Christmastime, but didn't pick it up until recently. Her live performance is simply outstanding. Her studio work is great on its own, but seeing the live performance with how she presents her vocal talents and delivery with such ease, to me, is astounding. If you have a passion for music, and enjoy the melodic union of vocals and instrumentation, you will NOT be disappointed with this DVD. She is a grounded and inspired soul, who happens to have a very sassy way about her. She engages with fans and has a wicked sense of humor, which makes her even that much more enjoyable to watch. I can't wait to see her live some day myself because this woman was born to sing. Enjoy. I did. Very much so!"
5,ride the wave...,"I bought this on a whim having not really had that much exposure to Adele's music...other than than the occasional radio track in my car. She seemed pretty good but you need to experience her in a venue like this concert to catch the wave and power of Adele. I have never experienced a singer who could communicate the emotional essence of her music so powerfully. You feel like you just had the break up of your life! Her ability to pull you into her world is unmatched because she makes it so easy to see and feel.This is an amazing concert. There is nothing like it..so simple, so direct, so connected, so easy to ""get"". Watch it and ride the wave....."
3,Was waiting for something more...,"Ok, She's Adele, outstanding I Know, but the hits are mostly sang by the crowd, and in the high parts like in some like you she transposes it for lower tones, after all not a big deal!, however I gonna buy the studio album, She worths it!!!"
3,SHIMMERS,"THIS IS MIDDLE EASTERN VIOLIN MUSIC ON A CLASSICAL LABEL. CHALHOUB COVERS SATIE'S ""GNOSSIENNE"" AND IT IS HAUNTING. THE ENTIRE RECORDING IS CLOSE TO MESMERIZING, BUT IS NOT SO ATMOSPHERIC LIKE OMAR FARUK TEKBILIK."
4,Mesmerizing,"A friend turned me on to this Cd and I really do love it. I bellydance and I especially love violin taqsim, and Chalhoub provides several moody, hypnotic set-pieces ranging from dramatic ( Red Desert) to light-hearted ( Don't Wake Me Up). Don't Wake Me Up is my favourite, because in 4 short minutes it moves through a range of rhythm changes and layered intrumentals, including tabla and guitar. I dance to this one a lot. I hope Chalhoub is planing a new release... I'd also love to hear him live!"
1,A Big Hassle,"This pump is neither convenient nor easy to use. It does not fit a standard bike tire valve - I have no idea why. Followed the instructions and I am no dummy but the pump seemed way too big for the valve and the air wouldn't go in. Don't waste your money, go get a floor pump (that's what I did)."
2,Last Resort for Air Pressure,"PROS: price; light; mobile; self-contained schrader/presta adapterCONS: gauge reads +/- 20psi ; you can pump smoothly for a long time or quickly and risk breaking your valve off...your choiceNot your main pump. A mobile solution for those that do not want to use CO2 cans. If you use this pump enough to get good with it, you probably got the wrong pump or just need new tires."
3,slow but it works,it is small so it fits in a backpack or hooks onto your bike. it takes a while to pump bike tires up and the pressure gauge doesn't work so you have to have a pressure gauge with you.
2,Did not fit for 20'' wheel,The opening for the pump would not fit onto the tire because the pump does not have an extension. This may be because the tire is a relatively small tire to pump and so has less space to fit the pump.
3,Good For It's Size,"This is a cheap and small pump that does it's job. Don't expect it to do much more.It takes A LOT of manpower to pump it to where you need to get it, but you sacrifice the ease of use for it's portability and price.It's kind of annoying that it doesn't explain how to switch it from a Presta to a Schrader valve, so here's a Youtube video that explains it: [...]And here's a video if you don't know whether your valve is a Presta or a Schrader: [...]"
3,Don't buy it if you need more than 90psi / No compre se precisar de mais de 90psi,"Getting my tires to 90psi took quite a bit of work. The pump gets really hardy after 75 psi and requires lots muscle power to get it pass it. The pump and the gauge works great until 75 psi, after that you can get to 90 psi making a lot of enforce, after that just forget about, further the difficult the air start to come off the tire.A bomba funciona bem, o marcador de presso também, mais se voc tem uma bicicleta seed e precisa de alta presso no pneu procure outra opo, da pra encher tranqüilamente até 75 psi, após isso, com muito esforo consegui chegar em 90 psi, a partir dai é praticamente impossível, além do esforo muito grande o ar comea a vazar do pneu"
4,Tiny and it works!,"Atractively designed, and nearly weifghtless. I used it for the 1st time the other day, and found the PSI indicator a little hard to read (imposable) without my cheater glasses on. However, it pumped my soft tires up easily, while getting quite warm while doing the job. Considering it near weightless state, it will be interesting to see how it lasts.To reiterate, I was really impressed with the size, the sharp design, its effectiveness, and ease of install."
4,great pump for emergencies,"So after buying my first fixie with high pressure tires i needed a basic pump and i did not want to spend the money on a nice big floor pump so after reading the positive reviews on here i ordered it. took me a while to figure out how to switch it from schrader valve but a quick youtube search fixed that. the pump works great, but when u are getting up to about 90psi its hard to hold and pump and i can see how it would be easy to break off on the valve. i was just careful and got it up to about 110 and i am happy. i will be buying a decent floor pump soon but this will do in the mean time."
3,Too much info in too little space,"This book mentions almost every concept useful in computer graphics. This is actually where the book fails. There are so many concepts, it can't cover all of them adequately. Things like rendering primitives, scanline conversion, and shadows are explained in detail while other concepts like quaternion interpolation, environmental mapping, and image filtering are barely summarized. The choice of SPHIGS as the language of examples is also questionable at best."
1,"Big, bloated, and boring",Guess what? I DID understand all of the math/theory in this book and I still thought it wasn't very good. Foley's explanantions of even the easiest concepts are lengthy and confusing--a bane for anyone using this book as either an introductory computer graphics text or as a reference. Nice try though.
3,Interesting but complex,"I thought the book was well done, but I would like a full source code sample."
1,Hell-o,"There is such a thing as Hell, m`dears, its listening to the meanderings of two geezers who both think they`re God but can`t decide which it is."
4,Debugging Applications is a Must Have!,John Robbins book is clearly written and easy to follow. He has valuable insights and provides wonderful examples and utilities. His BugSlayerUtil has been extremely useful in tracking down bugs within my software. Such a useful tool should not go unheralded.John has taken some hits becasue he was not able to include several .lib and dll files on his CD. This is not his fault but rather Microsofts licensing agreement. He goes out of his way to explain this and point you in the right directions to obtain the files.This book is a must have among serious developers.ETH
2,Caveat Emptor,"The promotional material for this CD fails to warn potential buyers that it IS NOT a recording of Giuseppe Becce's score for 'Caligari.' According to the liner notes: ""Virtually nothing is known about Becce's score, which is lost."" In order to construct this recording, ""Becce's authenticated short pieces for the silent cinema were taken as a starting point and focus and were then combined with other film music by the same composer in the interests of stylistic authenticity.""The music is entertaining enough, but represents only ""Becce's spooky tunes,"" and not his intended soundtrack to 'Caligari.'"
3,"Good movie, but not my thing","I confess I didn't know much about the events and history behind ""Miral"", so perhaps I wasn't the target audience. I thought there were some great shots, good cinematography, and some pretty powerful scenes. Freida Pinto (of Slumdog Millionaire) as the title character puts forth a very good performance. However, I never really felt like the movie sucked me in. I usually love foreign language films, even ones that take place a world away, such as Turtles Can Fly and The Stoning of Soraya M. (But I suppose this isn't a true foreign film, since they spoke in English quite often). Julian Schanbel, the director of Miral, also directed The Diving Bell & the Butterfly, which was a phenomenal film. I expected to like ""Miral,"" just as much, but I simply did not. I'm not a big fan of vignette style or frequent jumps through time. Nevertheless, like I said... it was a well-made movie with good performances and some interesting camera work."
2,just not that good...,"This movie to me was like a docudrama. Slow to get going and I don't know that some of the beginning was even necessary. The main character, Miral, doesn't really develop. At first she is an idealistic young school girl who sees unfairness for Palestinians and is caught up in mini rebellious acts. A bit later her perspective changes as she matures. Footage of actual clashes between Israeli + Palestinians, some of the history of creation of Israel as a nation, The Oslo agreement which has yet to be honored.... this is a library/highschool movie rental at best, sorry."
2,Not engaging enough......,"A movie is quite similar to a book in some sense...it has to reach out and grab me, hold my attention and stay with me long after it's over. This movie didn't do that. When I'm thinking more about paying bills and what I need to put on my grocery list, I know this movie isn't for me.I don't often watch politically charged films because even though the actual message is important and educational, they generally lack a back story which makes it interesting enough to stick with....this one was no different. It's not that the performances were bad, but they weren't intriguing or special, just there. Even if you like this sort of political storytelling, it didn't flow well and was not inspirational enough to recommend."
3,"Quick, Clever Read","This is a short little jaunt that is very well written and sucks you in by the first few pages. Shute is a fine wordsmith who writes compellingly about relationships and the devastation that sometimes accompanies their dissolution.The problem with this book is that it's fairly boring. The reader can see that this relationship began as a farce and grew only in a stunted and deviant way. Both parties in the relationship should have known better, and it's somewhat tiresome to read page after page of their refusal to see sense until tragedy strikes."
4,"Intelligent, non-sensational study of a troubled mind","Shute is a very good writer who has done a masterful job at describing the downward spiral of a lonely, disaffected woman. The title is misleading in that many readers may expect a steamy chronicle of sexual carnage. In fact, the book focuses onthe mind, not the body. This is a good quick read. Shute's characters are interesting and likeable. She doesn't provide a glib answer to the question posed by this book. There isn't one."
4,A good book,"""Singing in the Comeback Choir"" is the second book I have read by Bebe Moore Campbell. I like her style of writing and her stories. This book started off a little slow, but picked up about 1/4 of the way in. Interesting characters and an uplifting story. Things are a little too neatly wrapped up at the end, but I guess Ms. Campbell didn't want to end this book on a depressing note."
4,"Overall, a good MP3 player","I've had this MP3 player for some time and am pretty happy with it. It's light, compact, and multi-functional (doubling as a USB drive without cables). The menu is generally very intuitive, making it easy to figure out without constantly referring to the manual. I also like the fact that it runs on a single AAA battery, eliminating the hassles of recharging or the expense of having to replace proprietary batteries. On the negative side, I've found that the battery loses power even when the player is not use. I keep it in the gym bag and find that the battery lasts a lot longer if I take it out of the player. On a related note, the battery cover is extremely flimsy (as others have pointed out here). The little hatch has already broken off and I can't seem to find a replacement for it. Overall, it's a good performer despite the few flaws."
4,A much-needed book,"Few people are as well-qualified to write such a book as Gearge Otis Jr. George Otis has travelled the world as few have and has met the who's who in the Evangelical world. Moreover, Mr. Otis is a man of integrity. Although some may become disillusioned by the shenanigans that go on in the name of the Lord but Jesus and other biblical writers warned about false prophets, false teachers and false apostles. George Otis coats his criticism with a love for the Body of Christ. He does not make his own biases a criterion for right belief or right behavior but is careful to use scripture as the standard.I highly recommend this book."
3,"Beautiful, but incomprehensible","The first impression of Ascend just left me breathless. Every single panel is gorgeous eye-candy, absolutely stunning artwork. But when you dig a little deeper, I'm sorry to say, but it's a little disappointing.I think there's a really cool story here somewhere, but unfortunately it's too unclear and underdeveloped, and the dialogue is so underwritten that it's nothing more than vague, cryptic ramblings.But the artwork is still worth the cost of this book though."
5,This Honest Age - An Honest CD !!,"This was the first CD I bought in 2005, and I will find it hard to better it.I bought it after hearing a snippet on another website and thought it was worth listening to the whole CD, and I don't regret it one bit.As stated in another review, all but one have been self penned by Jen. They are well crafted and sung with a fine voice. Jen cites Jonatha Brooke amongst her influences, and you can hear a bit of Jonatha in her songs, but she has her own distinctive sound, which again sets herself above many of the tired, over-produced singers that fill the charts.I can't recommend this highly enough. A new talent has arrived.Cheers, Dave."
2,Christian music,This was not what I had expected. It is nice music to Mother Teresa's ideas but there was very little of Mother Teresa's words in it.
1,let's hear from the author,"I agree that some people are being way too harsh,BUT it has been over a decade and I think Melanie Rawn owes it to her fans to let us know what is going on with this book. When reading a trilogy like this one you get so involved with the characters, they become your friends, your enemies etc and to wait so long to find out what is going to happen to them is frustrating. So please Melanie let us know one way or another what you plan on doing with this series. Oh and by the way the Dragon series books are the best books ever! :)"
5,The Night That Panicked America,"This film is one that I could watch over and over. It took the radio version of Orson Welles ""War of the Worlds"" and brought it to life. The panic that Vic Morrow showed when he was in the tunnel with his wife and child, uncertain as to what was going on but knowing that he had to save his family by ending thier lives!! What a rush!!!! I video taped it when it was on television years ago, and I no longer have a VCR. I have been looking for the DVD for years. Cannot wait for it to be released."
1,It doesn't work,A pump that doesn't rise pressure...I didn't return it since I live in Costa Rica and it would take too long
1,Stupid and bad film,I saw this movie two years ago and it's one the worst picturesi ever watched.The leading actor who played the role ofChristopher is unknown and the story is dull and confused.
5,Great book for school media specialists,"This book is well organized and covers subjects such as managing the library, teaching library skills, working with students and teachers,technology ideas and much much more. This book was a great help for me at the beginning of the school year. It gave me some new ideas and useful tips in running my media center smoothly."
5,Works!,This works just fine with my Graco carseat. I've been using it for 5 months and have had no problems!
4,not his best work,"chang-rae lee has proven again that he is by far one of the best writers of our time. however, it was impossible to like or develop a reading relationship with any of these characters...especially the main character, jerry. there didn't seem to be anything redeeming about this guy. although he tried at the end but by then it seemed too late! i'm not exactly sure if lee was trying to convey that the human race is extremely flawed or this book just simply lacked that connection that you could actually fall in love with or at least like one character in the entire story."
5,4.5 stars,"This book, the first I've read by Lee, is a delight. The prose is simply wonderful: it's the kind of writing that makes us aware of how beautiful language can be. In addition, Lee's narration contains sharp insights about human behavior and the world in general.Add to this a story that is engaging and you've got a great book.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of some cliches I saw, particularly in the character of ""Pop,"" a curmudgeonly old ""geezer.""Read this book for an engaging story with fine writing."
5,She Slays Me!,"I enjoy Evanovich's books because they make me laugh out loud. Or as my son would say, LOL,ROF. Stephanie Plum is a great character, and Evanovich's voice is easygoing and and flip, all at the same time. Love her books.Suggestion of Death"
5,The best Stephanie Plum book yet. Keep them coming!,"How can you not love a bounty hunter who is the only one, in a group of four, not to have a gun for a visit to Atlantic city? The laughs are endless, and if you're not careful, you just might miss out on a few from reading too fast. The story is paced perfectly, although the mystery portion is not as detailed as the previous books. I still think this is the best yet."
4,Four to Score,"Four to Score is a very unique book. Stephanie Plum is a Bounty hunter in her fourth book. This time she is hunting down a waitress who has skipped bail. With cars blowing-up, old ladies getting in the way, and a man named Sally, this book is sure to bring great excitment. I enjoyed this book more than any of the previous books. Every night i would stay up at late and read. I enjoyed this book very much."
5,Best and funniest I've read in years.,"I found these books in my local library by accident and its the best accident I've had in years. I too laughed out loud many times and have only read 3 and 4. So many of the situations Janet Evanovich describes are real to me that it seems that at time she must be reading my mind! As an example, her attitude to ironing!"
3,Might Not Be For Everyone,"I enjoyed all of Ms. Evanovich's previous novels, but I think she went a little overboard with the trashy language and raunchy sex in the first half of this one. The likable characters are here, as well as her trademark humor, but the story itself is unremarkable. I have been telling my sister what a wonderful author Janet Evanovich is and promised to send Four To Score to her as soon as I finished it, but I'm having second thoughts. I think I'll recommend the first three books to her instead."
5,One of the top series to listen while you walk,"I walk often, alone, at night. Need a story that keeps me motivated to get the tennis shoes on. This series does it! Four to Score made me want to move to Jersey, to meet the men and Grandma, if nothin' else. Keeps your interest. Not so gruesome that it requires company. I've listened to one other, and will go back and request each audio tape so I don't miss a one."
1,Well at least its not as bad as the black maid outfit!,"Well..do to her lack of understanding the true character of trenton...it has an quite BAD similarity to many of her real life friends...including the ones she was living a dubble life with...I must say it raises my level of confidence in her ability to stab with daggers! I remember all about her and hourse girl..the parties...the cheating. Just glad I am blind as well as deaf! My friends had to punch this book into brail so I could read it! Only selected this book due to its easy language and lack of her real passions in life. Thesewould include immaturity, insecurity, ""the mirror"", laying back with the head on the pillow with saltines, and the way she liked to constantly bash trentons head into the wall!"
3,Usual Cast of Crazies,"This one seemed to drag a bit for me. Even though Morelli was hotter than ever, the whole storyline was a bit slow.This time out Stephanie is tracking Maxine Nowicki, who's wanted for skipping out on a car-theft charge. But of course that is not the whole story and in walks the usual cast of crazies that usually inhabit Stephanie's life. Sally Sweet, a cross dressing drag queen, Sugar his kinda roommate, the wonderful Lula, hot Joe Morelli, the very mysterious Ranger, the pot selling vegetable guy, Grandma Mazur and Joyce who just never seems to disappear.Of course apartments are firebombed and of course another car is torched, but hey, this is Stephanie Plum and these things happen.The romance, or whatever you would call it, heats up between Stephanie and Joe is what kept me reading this book. Their ""relationship"" was more interesting than the mystery, if that is what you would call it."
3,A disappointing book in this fun series.,The fourth book in this series is a real disappointment. The language was unnecessarily rough. Why did Evanovich feel she needed to include such raw language in her book? It distracts from the story. The story was fine on its own; it was entertaining and adventuresome. Why ruin a great mystery with language that doesn't fit the series at all?
2,Not worth the time...,"Diplomacy of Wolves managed to achieve many of the things I hate about fantasy novels. First, we had brutality masquerading as ""reality""...The lurid details were merely disgusting; the author did not match this level of detail when describing scenes of beauty, friendship, or heroism. Secondly, the characters were stereotypical fantasy types: the earnest, beautiful young diplomat, the rogue captain, the bumbling fool who tries to flee the action but ends up in its midst. Thanks, I'll just pop in my Star Wars tape. And finally, we had the story stop right in the middle of the action! The best fantasy writers manage to conclude part of the action, while leaving enough strands of the plot to carry the reader to the next books in the trilogy..."
2,"Fascinating world, stupid characters","There is some very fine world building that has gone into DIPLOMACY OF WOLVES; the world, its history, and the cultures which inhabit it, are all well drawn, with many clever touches.The plot, unfortunately, is only kept moving by the characters making the most idiotic decisions possible. Everyone jumps to the most outrageous conclusions about other characters' actions and fates, never thinking about alternate possibilities. No one questions the information given to them by mysterious supernatural entities. The plot moves quickly, but at only by sacrificing any credibility or sympathy the characters might have.I managed to read all of DIPLOMACY OF WOLVES, but the last several chapters were a slog towards the painfully obvious conclusion (which nevertheless is a surprise to the characters). I have no desire to read any further in the series."
1,Can I give this product 0 stars?,Flat out P.O.S.These bags suck. The fabric is soft so the bags fold and buckle with every bump. This leads to them going into the spokes. The flimsy internal plastic reinforcement does not go to the bottom of the bags and is insufficient to keep the bags form. The bias cut in the the front of the bags does not leave enough room to peddle so my feet hit the bags! The shock-cord clips for fastening the lower part of the bags to the bike frame broke within a few months.These are better suited for kindling than commuting.
5,Help! There are conservatives IN your bedroom!,"The title of this book is just BEGGING to be mocked, considering that conservatives want to meddle in what you do in the bedroom.I gave it five stars because this book does a good job of illustrating the profound shallowness of conservatives political discourse. ""Conservatives are angels. Liberals are monsters."""
2,A curious book,"The author of this book exhibits a certain malevalent talent--writing hate literature on par with Mein Kampf...but for children. If you think I must be exaggerating, check this book out. Truly nauseating. Perhaps it was written as a gag and attempt to provoke ""liberals"". Because anyone who actually bought and read this to their children is not only politically brainwashed themselves, but (like the author) probably in desperate need of anti-psychotic medication.2 stars purely because of its humor value and the proud liberal tradition of compassion for the mentally ill. A fellow American beseeches you to seek help, Ms. DeBrecht. We don't need to be indoctrinating our children to despise their fellow citizens. A true conservative would know that."
3,Corrected Version,"A few weeks ago, Code Red recalled this title due to the audio being 3 seconds out of sync with the picture. I am pleased to report that having gotten this re-release today, I can verify that the audio is now properly in synch with the video.Everything else is the same with this release. Those who held off can now buy without fear. However, be sure to check the back of the DVD case, it should have a new UPC sticker placed over the original UPC code. If you see that, it is the corrected version."
1,Overblown,"Always a remarkable vocalist, Maria McKee really dropped the ball with this one. It isn't the absence of the country edged rock she made with her band Lone Justice (sort of Dolly Parton fronts the Blasters), nor is it that this one distances itself from the more polished sound of her first two solo efforts. The problem here is that few of the tracks on ""Life is Sweet"" can even be identified as songs. The production is far too overbearing that it drowns any melodic or lyrical interest that might have been present with a more comprehensive approach. The most die hard of McKee fans might want this to complete their collection, but newcomers should, without question, pass this one by."
5,One of the finest rock albums of the 1990's,"Maria McKee finally strikes out on her own and finds her place in rock history. This is an album that would make Kurt Cobain proud.At first listen, I was a little thrown and shocked by this record. But after a few months, the songs quickly creeped under my skin and I still sing them today after 7 years!This is McKee's masterpiece and if she quit the music business today she should be very proud of this work and feel extremely accomplished.Every track on the album is so hauntingly beautiful. Beg borrow and steal to find this out of print work of art."
5,Jack Anderson's view of the NRA,In this book Jack Anderson points out what he sees to be the fanatical side of the NRA. He appears to have some personal issues with members of the NRA leadership and relates some racial and class discrimination antecdotes to make his point. He does make a good case in reference to a second amendment rights issue where a man claimed to have the right to own any weapon that the Army had in its arsenal. He makes other solid arguments as well. As a moderate NRA member for several years I agreed with some and disagreed with other opinions. I own the HC edition and found it to be an good quick read. A well written book to help form your own opinion.
5,"One of the spunkier, more confident ladies of R&B in the 80s","A talented and charismatic singer, Cherrelle was at just about the right age in 1988 to make a broadly appealing album. Old enough to get adults in the mood, but young enough to appeal to the teen set as well, and this robust album offers the best of both sides, featuring the gorgeous hit ballad ""Everything I Miss At Home"" and the sneaky, percolating ""Discreet.""""Crazy (For Loving You)"" is another nice ballad, and there's also another catchy tune with ""Keep It Inside."" One of the artists to benefit from the superior production work of Jimmy ""Jam"" Harris and Terry Lewis, this album is filled with the signature hooks and robust production that would also serve Alexander O'Neal, Karyn White, and especially Janet Jackson well over the years."
2,DON'T BOTHER!,"WOW, what a waste of my money. Buy the WATCH IT MADE IN THE USA book if you want a great book on tours. 1. It dedicates 1 sentence to each tour. 2. No pictures. 3. Few Details. 4. It looks like someone looked up ""tours"" and compiled them.I will say that this book is heavy on wineries & breweries, so if you are into that, this is a better book for you since WATCH IT MADE doesn't include that in their book. This book is also heavy into Postal tours, Hatcheries,and Newspaper tours. It doesn't even mention the Crayola Factory in PA.The other book is much more nicely put together AND its cheaper."
2,Hard to apply and ineffective,"I purchased this product because it was all natural. It works initially, but not more than a couple of hours. It needs to be reapplied throughout the day. I work in an air conditioned office and I can smell odor at the end of the day. I have also used it when I am at the gym and it definitely does not work.As in previous review, it is very sticky and you need to add a little bit of water before it can be applied otherwise it is too tough to apply. I have used less than 10 times and threw it away because it does not do the job. Do yourself a favor and buy the all natural crystal type deodorants."
4,Sticky,"It's quite sticky and leaves an oily film throughout the day, however I haven't got any skin irritation like with many other products."
2,Below averageI wish I hadn't bought it,"I was disappointed with what I found between the covers of this book which looks, from the outside, very helpful and informative. I found the selection of names left something to be desired, and there was nothing very exciting with the names that were here. The format isn't the best, and I would not count on this book to look up accurate meanings. I do like the fact that the 500 most popular names have their popularity number after them in the meanings index, but this small fact can hardly compensate for the number of faults this book has.As an author as well as a baby-name enthusiast, I found it lacking the necessary elements for a good resource in character naming. Though it might look helpful, it wasn't in the end.My advice, if you're thinking about getting it: don't. You'll wish you didn't. Spend your money on something by Rosenkrantz and Satran, or Lansky."
5,Bandit,"This has to be the best arm band for a bowler who has tendonitis of the elbow. I could not lift a bowling ball as it hurt to much. I was told about this arm band through a friend and have tried 3 others with no results. After I purchased this from Amazon.com I tried it and the pain was gone, I was able to bowl pain free. It works great"
3,BandIT Therapeutic Forearm Band,"The band works as advertised. Works great for QB's but slips on pitcher's arm, actually flew off during a game.PS. Any time a player complains of any type of arm pain, go and get it checked, better safe than sorry."
1,Doesn't stay in place!,"Any bit of movement, such as taking a walk around the neighborhood, and this band will slowly move from its proper placement (just below the elbow) toward the wrist. By the time I finished my 5 mile walk, I had to put it around my water bottle because it kept ending up flailing around my wrist! No matter how tight I tried to make it (even to the point of nearly cutting off my circulation) it kept sliding down my arm. This product may work for those of you who sit at a desk and use a computer, but don't plan on going anywhere wearing this -- unless of course you think it's a worthy bracelet."
1,Waste of money!,"I had high hopes for these bands. I have tried every type of forearm bands for my tennis elbows. I used one of these and it kept slipping down my arm. I had it tightened as tight as it would go, but once I started sweating during my workout, this band kept slipping down to my wrist.I requested a return label from the seller, but he refused. I will be doing a chargeback on my credit card. These bands are absolutely useless since they dont stay on the forearm.I did find a great forearm band for tennis elbow that stays on through my sweaty workouts - The Futuro Sport bands. These are great - and they have a tension pad on the inside that hits right at the area that acts up."
1,POS,"I bought this to help with my golfer's elbow after my physical therapist told me to look for a forearm band that did not stretch. Well, I guess that is the one plus to this. It also offers a fair amount of positioning. However, it is extremely uncomfortable. It alternated between slipping down my forearm to cutting into it. The ""strap"" part is rough velcro-backed nylon that leans rub marks on the skin. Also, as noted in other reviews, the padding on the plastic plates are about a 1/4"" too small which allows the edges of plastic to also dig into skin. However they let this product get passed development is beyond me..."
3,Better Suggestion,"This is ok, but it does cause pinching at the edges of the support pads. They supposedly are bendable, but they return to their original shape very quickly, so you can't rely upon that. Additionally, after trying to bend it - just to the point where it was flat, the plastic began to tear.I tried several different bands for tennis elbow. The one I found to be best is the Mueller Hg80 Tennis Elbow Brace. It is available on Amazon."
1,it slides down my arm,I developed tennis elbow and thought this would help. Don't use this if you sweat. It is tight on your forearm like a tourniquet and the black velcro bands do not stretch. As you play and start sweating the Bandit slides down your arm which is narrower than the top portion you placed it on. It then becomes useless and a nuisance. The rubber against your arm does not absorb swet...it just makes it slide. I recently discovered a similar product that has elastic bands that stretch with your arm and prevents sliding down your arm....that name is Tennis Elbow Guard Rx. Works for me and it's half the price.
3,bands slip when prespiring,The bands do provide great support but when you sweat they start to slide off your arms. I'm constantly adjusting them while playing sports.
4,Nice for tennis elbow,"Bought this on a recommendation from a friend to treat a tennis elbow I got from cutting trees after the October snowstorm. Used it for some time now and it seems to work, i.e., I'm slowly on the mend. Beats other products tried before, and a trip to the doctor who would have to me to just take it easy. Would recommend to others in a similar situation."
5,Bandit,The Bandit works great. I use to have one & lost it. So when my tendonitis starting acting up again after trying different products in the past I went right back to Bandit
4,Good read but....,"I really like Gary Hardwick's books. His books are thrilling and raw, coming from a black mans' prospective. Cold Median did not disappoint. It was a page turner with a lot of action and hardcore violence. My only complaint is the multiple spelling errors or typo's. A little distracting, especially during some good moments of the book."
3,How to relieve your body of stress and heart disease.,"This is a nice little audio tape that shows people how to relax and get a handle on heart disease. In this hectic world of ours, everbody needs to relax and focus on what is most important--the health of themselves and their family. Collinge in this short audio tape shows listeners on how to focus their mind's stength on relaxing different parts of their bodies. A recent article in Newsweek seems to bear out what Collinge is saying. People who can relax and involve themselves in their health often lead longer lives.A nice little listen on those hectic days. It may not seem scientific, but it can show results on your health."
3,Dave Barry - 'nuff said ?,"No, not really... While not reaching the hilariosity of Michael Greene's ""course sex"" book, its still a fun read.I got my very fair amount of chuckles out of it."
1,Horrendus writing,"Although this was a fascinating story, the writing style makes it a painful, agonizing read. It should have taken a day to read this but it took me several. I'd read a few pages and get so frustrated that I'd have to put it down for a while. Also, there were too many stupid little details about the author and not enough about the crime."
4,Great EV Olive Oil!,"This is for the price THE best olive oil I've had. (I've had only one better EVOO than this, but it was a very expensive, boutique oil, that I can't remember the name of! Hence the 4 stars)I have done several oil tastings/flights and this smashes the competition. I bought it on a whim in a ""regular"" grocery store (Kroger) mainly out of curiosity. (My wife thought I was nuts)I was VERY impressed with the soft, buttery, mildly nutty flavor. This is how EVOO should taste! Not at all like the other 99% of EVOO that tastes so grassy and bitter you would swear it was made from lawn clippings! Buy it, you won't be disappointed."
4,Labor of love for Andy Garcia,"After WWI, Paris was the place to be for artists; Picasso was top dog, but the brash Modigliani (played very convincingly by Andy Garcia) is determined to earn his own fame his own way...though he is finally movitated to clean up his act (at least a little) for the sake of his child.A passionate and engaging film about a not-entirely-sympathetic lead character, whose raw talent does not quite make up for his drinking, disrespect, and general self-indulgence. Tremendously well-done atmosphere of 1920's Paris (not that I'd really know the difference), and clearly a labor of love for Andy Garcia.(Just wondering--does every movie star desire to make a movie about his favorite artist or musician? Clint Eastwood's Bird; Ed Harris's Pollock--about the painter, not the fish; Kevin Spacey's Beyond the Sea; etc.)"
4,British Pop Gets the Best of Me,"This CD is absolutely amazing for any British wannabe. I'd recommend it to anyone, and I'm the only girl in the Midwest who owns it, which makes it a hit at parties. Get it, you'll love it!"
1,So BAAAAD!,"Could not be worse. I hate it. I use it flip 6 months. Also I use it only because at office of another is not available. That it has earned every times is necessary to climb under a desk, to take out all 2 USB a connector and to insert them back. It kills my second computer. When it happens the manager is compelled will not only replace it but also to buy a new computer.If you like to climb often under a desk - buy not reflecting!"
5,Go Rhino,this is just the product my husband was looking for. He tried other shelves but they arrived dented twice! This holds everything he needs to detail his truck and looks great too.
5,A Book You Can Imagine Yourself In,"Can't Get There From Here is just...awesome. While reading it I imagined myself in the book and I smelled what they smelled, tasted what they tasted, saw what they saw, and actually felt what they felt. Usually I don't pick up these kinds of books. But after reading this book and actually REALIZING that this happens to my generation today, makes me think about doing everything I can to help the homeless because we teenagers don't know how blessed we really are unless we don't have anything or don't get what we want. So I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. This book was so good, it made me think that I was trying to survive, and I just couldn't put this book down!"
3,Can't get there from here,"I liked this book because i could related to some of the charecters and there situations with there families. How they are treated is not right because some times how they are homeless they cant help it. Being beat, and treated unfairly in there home is most of the reasons why they are on the street. This is why i like the book."
5,cant get there from here,"Cant get there from here was about a bunch of kids that had a bad home life, that ran away, had no where to go and ended up homeless. Along the way they made friends that basicly became all they had, there family.Not having any money and no where to go they depended on the people on the streets to feel bad for them and spare some extra change. Although many people looked down on them they realized that the kids were somewhat depending on them so they spare some change or buy some food for them. Throughout the book many of the friends have horrible accidents in horrible situations while the other kids deal with the feeling of losing a best friend or to them a family member.My opinion on this book is that I enjoyed it very much all the drama and such situations that i thought could never and would never happen did and now that ive opened my eyes a bit to see that todayy that stuff is probably going on and that something should be done to stop it."
5,Run away children,"Have you ever felt like running away? If so, then you should read Can`t Get There From Here by Todd Strasser. He gives you the down to truth reality about living on the streets of New York. Maybe is a young teenager that has runaway from her family because her mom has forgotten she existed, she would rather have her daughter running through the streets of New York instead of a safe home. Forming a street family, Maybe, along the her friends Rainbow and Maggot, face the cold bitter New York alone with no help from anybody and yet everybody telling them they should go home and that they could die out here. Even though they believe they should go home they don`t even try to help them. There hiding behind buildings, kicked-off of the side walks, barely hanging on for their lives. Read this book to find their future if it`s not too late, and think again before you run away."
1,stupid and offensive!,"This so called ""Movie"" not only is one of the stupidest things I have ever witnessed, It is extremely offensive to Africans, black people and the whole adoption process. If Pauly Shore ever visits African again he better hope some of it's citizens hasn't seen this movie or he may just not make it out alive. I do not see how anyone with half a brain thinks this movie is funny! I realize it is supposed to be a comedy. But this is ridiculous! The little paragraph at the end by Pauly explaining that even though he made fun of adoption, that adoption is a serious matter makes it even worse in my opinion. What a tasteless piece of Garbage! I will NEVER watch anything that has Pauly Shore in it again EVER! i had to give this one star in order to post and that is the ONLY reason I gave it 1 star!"
1,Save your money,"Don't bother with this book and save your money for better things. Dr. Berstein's Diabetes Solution is by far the best book on managing diabetes. It is better written, more complete, and easier to understand."
5,Control your diabetes,This book will really help you. Death to diabetes is a great book to start and beginning to good heath. Dewayne Mcculley tell his experience of his close to death ordeal. He also share how he was able to beat diabetes. Great information on how our body works when we have hign blood sugar and how to eats right foods and get the right suppement that we need to get healthy. Their are recipes you can use. If you want to get rid of your diabetes start with this book.
1,Garbage,"I am reviewing the 2004-2005 which I assume the 2005-2006 will have similiar content to its prior edition. Anyways, honestly, Wiley is overrated. The outline is an unorganized collection of gibberish. It seems the editor just basically quickly jolt down information that they ""assume"" to be important. As a result, the outline is incoherent, confusing, and basically garbage. I did not learn anything from using wiley books. After one week, I gave up on using Wiley, which is now collecting dust in my bookshelf.Instead, I suggest using Becker Conviser. There materials are waaay superior. The books are in ""plain English"" and you will actually learn the materials. No wonder Becker Conviser is known to be the very best way to prepare for CPA exam, not Wiley."
2,"Bel canto is not JUST ""beautiful singing.""","Yeah, sure, she has all the notes....But being able to sing the notes is just not enough. I mean, its like Brad Pitt trying to act shakespeare. Sure, he's gorgeous and he's got a great body, but going up on that stage and simply flexing your muscles JUST DOES NOT cut it. Where's the pathos? Where's the sense of drama? She sings her recitatives like she's reading a grocery list. If I wanted a list of arias, I wouldn't have bought the opera. And you know what? Her high notes arn't THAT great."
5,Great Ointment,"These are great for irritated skin. Great on our daughter's skin. But so was Triple Paste but Triple Paste can only be used on a short term basis. It dries out the skin. Therefore, Aquaphor is great for the long term and also as a preventive."
1,Dry And Boring,"How dry and boring can one book be? This book could have been less than half its size and still been too long. How many times can we hear the same story repeated over and over? Four times is four too many! I'll admit that the original idea was a good one, but Pears just wasn't able to carry it off. By the time I finished I was not only relieved, I wished all the characters would just drop dead and ESPECIALLY Sarah Blundy. When Pears finally did reveal the ""truth"" about this dubious woman, my only thought was ""Oh, come on! What a cop out! Finally, I have to agree with those reviewers who said The Name of the Rose is NOTHING AT ALL like An Instance of the Fingerpost. Rose is literature, while Fingerpost is pulp fiction!"
1,Sorry to spoil the fun,"I bought this book soley on the recommendation that it was a good companion to The Name of the Rose. Excited I dove right in, but I was quickly struck but the complete absence of resemblance to the the great book mentioned above. Other than historical fiction I did not find many similarities. The Name of the Rose is one of my favorite books because it is extremely well written story, erudite and informative, with great insight of the times. Moreover, the facinating puzzle that unfolds for the reader has been rarely equaled in my reading. I found none of these qualities in Insistance, the characters annoying and one dimensional, the plot meandering, and little if any information about the 16th century I could not get out of short History Channel episode.In a word this book was disappointing.To borrow from ""Rose,"" anyone suggesting a positive comparison between the two books should be guilty of heresy."
1,Verbose,"This may be a great book, but the wordiness (not length of story, but torrent of unneccessary words) was too much, after even 50 pages. I don't enjoy the verbosity of the book and wish the writer could have been more succinct and precise in his writing."
5,Mesmerizing -- the best historical fiction,"This book explores the reasons the characters act the way they do -- giving the reader an understanding of (an empathy with) the authentic intellectual life of another time and place. As a teacher, I made the mistake of picking this up just at the hectic end of the school year so I couldn't read it for long stretches -- but no matter. It was completely satisfying even two pages at a time! And it taught me a great deal and made me want to learn more about this period of time -- the highest praise I can give to a book. Everybody I know is going to get this book for Christmas (if I haven't convinced them to read it already!)"
4,An mostly excellent historical mystery.,"Pears' novel is an ambitious, suspenseful mystery set in 17th century England that succeeds on almost all counts: plotting, period detail and writing style. I have always been fascinated by this period in English history and was eagerly looking forward to it, especially after reading all the glowing reviews by other readers. The powerful ending almost had me cheering! The comparison with ""Name of the Rose"" is fairly apt, although I feel that Eco's novel is even more weighed down by philosophical digressions. Weaknesses? The appropriately baroque plot necessitated by multiple viewpoints skimps a little with period detail and renders some of the lesser characters a bit bland. But maybe that's just me being picky!"
3,"Surprising conclusion,but such a ponderous path to get there","I had read Pears' Dream of Scipio and loved it so I started Instance. I'll not comment on the plot; others have done that very well. A bit more than halfway through, I was ready to give up and go to other books on my list, because the writing seemed to be becoming increasingly ponderous and I have a life to live, filled with other activities. I sped through the third chapter and was rewarded by the final chapter with it's unexpected conclusion. My advice to prospective readers - read the first chapter, speed-read the second and third, and carefully read the finale, which cleverly wraps it up. Also, unless you can read this more or less continuously, don't bother. The characters are too numerous and details too complex to put it down for a while and then pick it up."
4,great.. but better if I'd know less about the period...,"It's hard reading a book like this, when my doctoral thesis is on the medical literature of the 1660s. I've read so much about the characters in this novel -- and the true stories upon which it is based -- that it's almost like reading a novel where my friends are the main characters....My gripes about the research: Thomas Willis doesn't get a mention. He supervised the dissection of Anne Greene, led the research into brain anatomy that Lower and Wren assisted with -- Willis's book, ""Cerebri anatome"" was published in 1663 -- and taught anatomy to John Locke. Any study of Oxford in the 1660s ought to mention him.That said, it's a cracking read. And it's good to know that I'm not the only one obsessed with the late seventeenth century's impact. With hope, it will guide more people towards the real stories of the period, which are just as fascinating as this fine modern novel."
4,Great read,"I almost didn't continue this book, after the first 20 pages because I had been misled by the marketing into thinking this was a historical mystery (emphasis on mystery). Rather, the emphasis is on the history. Pears takes you deeply into the time period, particularly the political, religious and scientific atmosphere of the times. It was fascinating and vivid enough that descriptions of then-current experimental practices caused me to feel a little green around the gills. By the end of the book, although I was moderately interested in whodunit, I realized that I was much more interested in why it was done in the context of the religio/political situation of the time. Wonderfully written, great characters, keeps you guessing about everything (who lied, why did they lie, who knows why they are lying, is _that_ person lying, can we really know the truth?!) Loved it. Gave it 4 stars because of the confusion over genre."
1,A Complete Waste of Time,"Or was my time completely wasted; or was what I wasted, time; or perhaps my waste of time was complete. In the time you would waste reading this enormous and enormously tedious book, you could read two or three really good ones. Do that."
1,AN INSTANCE OF THE FINGERPOST,"A POINT-OF-VIEW NOVEL THAT IS TOO CONFUSING TO FOLLOW IF YOU TEND TO NOT READ STRAIGHT THROUGH. ONE MUST BE THROUGHLY FAMILIAR WITH HISTORY OF THE RESTORATION PERIOD IN ORDER TO FOLLOW THIS STORY. I WOULDN'T REALLY RECOMMEND IT, AND I WAS SORRY TO BE LED TO IT BECAUSE OF MY OTHER CHOICES IN HISTORICAL FICTION. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE EXCEPT A EUROPEAN HISTORY MAJOR, AND I USED TO TEACH ENGLISH LITERATURE MYSELF!"
1,Boooooooorrrring,"Reduce this book by 50% and it would still be way too verbose. The first narative was able to maintain my interest from time to time, but the second two just overwhelmed me with needless boring nonsense. I was waiting for the blundy girl to be narrator, that may have spiced things up a bit. What an enormous waste of time. Fingerpost, I gladly give you the finger."
2,Boring,"I loved the Name of the Rose, going sofar as to read it both in italian and english to make sure I was catching all the language-play. This book is NOT the Name of the Rose. It is boring and difficult to get into. It picks up a little at the end, and I did skip around to see if it got any better, but it didn't. There is nothing particularly 'perverted' or offensive about the book, it's just boring, and the author confuses a 'complex' with 'interesting'."
4,Quick and fun read,Another good one from Iris! I really loved this book but thought it ended a little too abruptly.
4,Not bad,Was for a practical joke. Worked pretty well as a joke. Should have gotten one smaller. Will keep it handy for future joked
4,GREAT FOR THE MOTION GRAPHICS PROFESSIONAL,There aren't many great books on the market for Motion Graphics professionals and this one is a 'must have'. I love the storyboards and conceptualization surrounding each project. It's a really great collection of work that should inspire any designer.
4,The best,He can and spout work great. Nom dents or rust to worry with. Highly recommend the water can. Use it in my offload jeep adventures on a regular basis.
4,nice samurai version,"if you are into samurai anime, this was nicely done and it has very catchy tunes. it also has very good fight scenes and a cool concept of an American samurai."
3,Maybe the right book but definitely the wrong time,"On one hand, this book does a fine job of making the reader think : Why not leave a lousy job? Why not leave a unsatisfying relationship? On the other hand it fails to understand today's economic reality. There are a lot of folks out of work today and after begging their landlords to accept a partial payment or telling the bank that the mortgage check is NOT in the mail or having to go to the community food bank so their kids could have dinner these folks would love to have a ""safe"" but boring job. What the author calls a comfort trap millions of others would call peace of mind."
1,Absolutely awful yet enthralling,"Released as an ""artistic"" foreign film, this movie is disgustingly vile, unbelieveably violent and something that will not leave your memory soon. Yes there were set design awards...blah blah blah...at its core it appears to me to be the work of a creative and demented mind. I saw it 10 years ago and it is still one of the most horrific movies I have ever seen. Still, I cant not recommend it as it does have appeal to a widespread audience for some reason. View at your own risk is my suggestion."
2,More than a few scenes are too much to take,"I'm not squeamish or prudish by any means, but more than a few scenes in this movie forced me to turn away. If 'shock' is art, than this is artful. It's a movie that pushes your nose in it and forces you to deal with your feelings. My feelings were 1) revulsion 2) pity 3) titillation."
1,Excellent . . . if you're pathological,"Stylistically perfect and visually gorgeous, this is also one of the most unremittingly sadistic and gruesome movies ever made. If you can watch this one over and over, as the writer from Portland, Maine, confesses, you really do need to seek professional help. (But in the meantime, don't stop watching it -- that might be the only thing keeping you from doing something horrible.)"
1,Worst Film of All Time!!,"Take away the visual style, set pieces, production and direction and THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE, AND HER LOVER has no redeeming value. It is a film of excess, gore, humiliation, and decadence. This is a detestable movie with characters we don't care about and an ending that is so graphically sick it is beyond reproach. Why this film is hailed as great by some people defies explanation. To find out why by watching again wouldn't change this reviewers mind. This reviewer would rather watch JACKASS:THE MOVIE...at least there is some humor and comedy to all the decadence in that film."
5,Where's the Region 1 DVD?,"I saw this great movie in the theater when it came out. With all the crap movies out there available on DVD, why is this great flick not available on DVD in the USA? I certainly am NOT paying $90 for a used copy. Put this out on DVD!"
1,I wish I could give zero stars!,"The film ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover"" was an incredibly pretentious bit of ordure. While I like black humor, this was utterly sicko. Watch anything else, even ""Ishtar""!"
2,Doesn't live up to the title,"I got this book in hopes of learning more about the influence that ancient Persian culture (e.g., Zoroastrianism) may have had on postexilic Judaism -- unfortunately, I was quickly disappointed.While the author does a decent job of covering ancient Persian history, a surprisingly small portion of the book is actually devoted to discussing what religious/philosophical views may have passed from Persian culture into Judaism, and therefore the Bible. I was especially surprised at how sparse the (-single-) chapter on Zoroastrianism was!Since this book does not thoroughly address the subject that most people would be getting it for, based on its title, I wouldn't recommend spending money on it. It's a shame too. This is a very important topic and there is a real deficiency of serious books on the subject... I can only hope that someone will soon produce a book that does it justice."
5,A Christmas fantasy.,"I still enjoy animated films, the holiday ones are always my favorites, I think was a great idea for a holiday movie, 9 dogs have been kidnaped and exploted by this villian and they get accidentally rescued by this Elf, they are taken to the North Pole and help Santa Claus on Christmas Eve,I added this movie to my holiday collection and will watch it for years to come."
5,Good Tips,These guys know what they're doing. Lots of great tips and tricks. Very helpful if you are learning how to tie dye and want to take it to another level.
3,Good Info,"This book offers good information to become closer to your true self. If you really want to awaken the Shaman within, I would suggest training and initation from, www.holisticawareness.org, a shamanic institute offering powerful distance and in person initiations, founded by an indeginous african/native american woman."
4,Very encouraging!,"A friend turned me onto this book, and I will share it with others too! For parents who have prodigal children, this book is a great encouragement. It doesn't offer quick-and-easy steps, but it does offer hope and shows us how sometimes all we can do is to love them unconditionally and keep praying for their return."
4,knowledge is power!!!,"Very intresting book,, it explains the MEDICAL stand point about depression which involves diffrent parts of the brain,,also explains that a diet higer in protein lower in sugar is very beneficial to people who suffer from chemical imbalance! I learned a lot reading this book, and recommend it to anybody suffering from medical depression, because its not your fault! And you don't have to suffer alone anymore!!"
5,5 STARS for H2O,This one of a kind series can only be summed up in two words....5 STARS......because it has everything girls....and boys....like to see in a TV show! IT ROCKED! I will be watching it over and over again.
2,Horrible,"This book was used for test purposes in for our Sergeant's promotion. It was written really bad. It had run on sentences, and just awful grammar. I did not learn anything from the book that I did not already know. Much of it does not even pertain to a Sergeant's position in our department. It was a common sense book that choked the life out of you."
1,"Drawn out and boring, hard to understand","I found Supervision of Police Personnel (6TH) to be pretty much drawn out and boring. It is painfully evident that the same information could have been relayed in a lot less then 400 boring pages. It was difficult to follow and often repetitive. A lot of detail was focused on irrelevant material. This was a difficult book for me to swallow (as a 12 year LEO), but it certainly rated high as a sleep aid for me."
4,Supervision of Police Personnel,Same like the Criminal Investigation book. I needed it so that I can study for the Sergeant exam. And Amazon.com was the only place that I could've order the book from. Keep selling the special books.
2,ES8168 Vortex convex Shaver,"Comparing this unit to my current shaver (which is also a Panasonic Linear, model ES8068) the older model does a *much* better job, plus having an induction charger. On the Vortex, the automatic clean takes THREE hours and its better just to soap and rinse the blades than use the cleaning system. The Vortex is a disappointment as far as performance goes."
5,Outstanding,"I bought this to surprise my husband, whose old Norelco was finally worn out after years of good service. We were quite pleased with the close shave and ease of cleaning. An excellent value."
5,awesome!!,"This sign is just as I hoped!!!Its a good size, made of great material and I love what it says :)I cannot believe how fast it arrived also!"
3,I Think This One's OK,"This is my second JVC camcorder, and it isn't bad at all. I haven't had it for very long, but it was pretty easy to use. It is not feature-rich, but it has enough to keep me occupied. I am a beginner camcorder user, and I was shooting and playing tapes back with ease very quickly. The focusing isn't great, but on the upside, it does pretty well in darker environments. I was shooting in dim conditions and the picture was nice and clear. The sound is OK too. Playback was alright, but somewhat grainy. The appearance of the camera isn't all that sleek, but all in all it is a reliable, easy to use model."
4,Carefree Camcording!,"I am a fan of the VHS-C format, even though my previous camcorder, a Panasonic, was somewhat tempramental. No problems here, though, as what we have is a sturdy, inexpensive gem of a camera with enough features to satisfy the average user - not too many extarneous ones that you really don't need anyway! The zoom is just fine, the fade is a nice touch on a model of this size, and we're looking forward to creating our answer to Wallace & Gromit once we try the animation setting! Great value."
3,Good outline for billing business,"This book is a good general outline and business reference for anyone considering starting a business. The book focuses on sound general business information applicable to any business and it's owner. What to do and how to market a business, the tasks and research involved. The old adage of fail to plan - plan to fail, comes to mind. The book also has more information for transcription than claims (I think claims was an afterthought), but it discusses process for medical billing and some resources and references that may prove useful. A good general reference book for a claims biller or transcriptionist. However, this book will not give you the training or experience you will need to bill medical claims confidently."
3,Decent book but has some holes,"This book is a good start for you to get an idea for the transcription business. My wife wanted to start doing this as an at-home career. It was not until we began the business that we found out just how ignorant we were. Even reading this book cover to cover did nothing to prepare us for the actual work. This caused us to make many mistakes, not totally to blame for this book, however, there was not much that actually helped us.Overall I would recommend this book as just the first step to beginning then find many more books to read to augment your attempt at beginning this as an at-home profession.Thank you for reading my review."
2,Not detailed enough,"As founder and developer of a unique medical transcription company, EchoScribe Inc, I know what it takes to start a transcription company. This book comes short intoo many places. Details are lacking and not for the beginner nor the advanced transcriptionists that wants to start their own company. In fact, come to our website directly to see how we may help you start your own company. Our careers section www.echoscribe.com/careers.asp has many interesting options."
4,For Kurt V. fans only!,"If you like his other works, you'll love this book. However, for those not ""initimate"" with his style, flow, imagry, alter-ego Kilgore Trout, etc.. it may seem like a disjointed mess. It's a very unique premise, 100% Kurt. In short, I really enjoyed reading it, but would not recommend it to everyone."
4,Not average Vonnegut,"This book is not for all people. If you have not read this author before you won't want ot read this book. He talks of a fantasy world where everything repeats itelf from the previious ten years, but only a few people know when the rerun as Vonnegut likes to call it is over. The writing is like the storyline of the book, it repeats itself over and over again goinng nowhere but where it has been. I have red Vonnegut before and appreciate his style, but I fear that most won't. A bad introductory book to Vonnegut, but fans will love it."
2,disappointed,"Compared to his other stuff, this book was a disappointment. For devoted fans it is worth the read. However, I usually want to read his books again, and this one did not inspire that desire."
3,Entertaining but Forgettable,"TimeQuake seems like Kurt Vonnegut's farewell to his readers. It is not a proper novel at all, but a mish-mash of an idea for a novel, various short stories by his alter-ego, Kilgore Trout, and recollections of Vonnegut's extended family. I listened to the audio version of this book on a long car trip, which was perfect, because there was no long plot to get lost in, merely a series of amusing anecdotes."
2,I have never had as many problems reading a book,"OK, I'll probably get lynched for this, but...I think this is the most disjointed work Vonnegut ever produced. I have never had a hard time finishing a book. This one took a laborous six months to complete. In my opinion, the book should have died on the writers block. Unfortunatly, I must give credit for one line, which is the reason I bought the book in the first place. ""All people, living or dead, are purely coincidental"" sums up the way I feel about the world most days. I will always love his classic works, my favorite two being ""Slaughterhouse 5"" and his short story ""Harrison Bergeron"". Leave this book alone and read some of his better stuff."
3,Vonnegut's goodbye,"Timequake doesn't have much to offer as a novel for someone who isn't familiar with Vonnegut's work and his life experience. Neither does the book reveal much new about him. I can therefore see the disappointment of some previous reviewers. I thought Timequake was a very personal salute of Vonnegut to his readers, and I liked it like that."
4,Like a warm blanket on a cold wet day,"Granted, it's no Breakfast of Champions, but it's Vonnugut, and he still knows how to write love."
2,Mostly a Regurgitation of Breakfast,"This book has some nice moments, including, ""We are put here on Earth to fart around; don't let anyone tell you any different.""But it's really kind of a tired rehash of many of the innovative and catchy ideas in Breakfast of Champions.If you want a good Kurt Vonnegut book, read Breakfast of Champions. It's the fresh, interesting, hilarious version of Timequake."
3,Vonnegut gets darker as he gets older,"Mr. Vonnegut is beginning to show his age. Not one of his better books, but as always, entertaining. Vonnegut seems to be getting more pessimistic, prompting me to want to urge him what a reader of his said: ""Please don't kill yourself."" The ending saves the book. Barely."
3,Playful and entertaining WW2 propaganda flick,"Across the Pacific is an entertaining little propaganda picture from 1942 before the format became stale, reuniting Bogart, Greenstreet and Mary Astor with The Maltese Falcon's director John Huston for a playful shipboard thriller executed with enthusiasm and plenty of zippy dialogue. The Japanese stereotyping is kept in check until the last couple of reels of arrant nonsense when it roars into overdrive, but otherwise it holds up remarkably well as solid studio entertainment with a fine selection of DVD extras"
3,Lesser John Huston but quite entertaining,"This spy thriller uses plot 39a--you know, the one in which the hero deliberately gets drummed out of the army so he can pursue counter-espionage activity dealing with the enemy. A poltically incorrect, pre-Sony Humphrey Bogart foils Japanese attempts to sabotage the Panama Canal. Huston uses some deft touches in filming this well-worn, hokey plot. With Sydney Greenstreet as a Japanese-loving adversary, Mary Astor as Bogie's romantic interest and Victor Sen Yung as a smart-ass Japanese gunsel."
1,Wrong Battery!!!!!,"This is NOT the correct battery for the devices they list. And, they don't carry the correct one! So, now I have to return this one and can only hope that they refund my shipping, too!"
3,Not as good as Hanging Time or Burning Time,"Aside from the lame title (seems more appropriate for a sleazy romance), this book was less than appealing to me. The plot development was SLOW...not that I even cared what was going on. The characters didn't DO much, the sections focusing on April's mother and Sanchez's mother were seemingly pointless, and the ""crime"" was boring. Get it at the library or skip it altogether."
4,Great upgrade scanner,"The Epson 1640u is a great upgrade scanner from a 600x1200 dpi scanner. With the recent drop in price it costs as much as my original 600x1200 scanner. The color and detail is very good. While the scanner is slow for high resolution scans using a USB connection (though a SCSI-2 connection is also available if you buy the cable and card), it still is quicker than the 600x1200 dpi scanner it replaced for more detailed scans. It is highly recommended for photo albums that don't need 8x10 photos."
1,False List Price,"I would hope that Amazon takes action against this seller. The seller leads you into thinking that your are getting a great price for this item at $19.99, when IN FACT , the seller is asking almost 3 times the MSRP. IN FACT the seller has advertised the retail price as $43.99, when IN FACT the MSRP is $7.99, Check it out for yourself - go to Panasonic on line.Also, If you go to the sellers web site the product is listed for $19.99 without the misleading MSRP that the seller has giver to Amazon's customers."
3,O.K but...,"This is ok but a little bulky if you want to take it around places, so if you move around a lot while wearing headphones don't get these"
1,Already?!?!,"I've barely had these headphones one week and already the right earbud has gone out!I love the volume control and they are comfortable, but it defeats the purpose if you're only listening to the music in one ear!"
3,Slightly Shady is right,"I enjoy Amanda Quick's novel (aka Jayne Ann Krentz), but this one follows its name to the letter. I think Jayne is putting more emphasis on her contemporary romances then on her historical ones. This one left me less then thrilled.I look forward to her next Amanda Quick Novel...hopefully it will be better."
2,Slightly lacking,"The first 2 Amanda Quick books I read were the exact same story with different names (I forget which ones they were). I kept reading her books anyway because I like her writing style and most of the books have enough of a change that you don't get bored. This book is the first one of hers that I was disappointed in. It felt like she had a deadline to meet and didn't have time to do more than an outline. The characters of Lavinia and Tobias were very sketchy, I never got a good sense of them. Lavinia's niece and her boyfriend were much more interesting, but they were only secondary characters so we didn't really get their story. If you are a fan of Jayne Krentz's Amanda Quick books, don't worry if you miss this one. You've read it much better before. If you have to check it out, do so at the library."
3,Slightly....Disappointing,"As a devout Amanda Quick fan, I was excited to get hold of her latest novel. But I must confess that it was not as vintage a Quick book as I had hoped. The relationship between Lavinia and Tobias lacked the sparkle and passion of her earlier lovers and the denoument lacked closure. I agree with other reviewers that her Regencies of late have become plot driven - I miss the sigh-appeal of earlier heroes and the delightful eccentricities of previous heroines. It was almost as if Jayne owed her contract a book at this time - although well thought-out and crafted as always, the sparkle wasn't there. I would not recommend this as a starter Quick book to anybody - ""With this Ring"" or ""Mistress"" would top my list of passion at its best. I shall continue to buy anything by Amanda Quick but with lower expectations. She still writes a great book when compared to some other authors on the market."
1,"Affair, redux","Let's see, hero injured in prologue. Slightly short, red-haired female protagonist in charge of younger woman. Said protagonist supporting herself with an investigatory career. Flawed hero joins in her investigation, and he also happens to be charged with the upbringing of younger man, who falls for the aforementioned younger woman while the heroine and hero argue. Give up on this one and just read Affair, which is the first time Quick trotted out this EXACT plot and did it much better."
4,Somewhat Slow,"I have to admit I did like this story, although it was somewhat slow for my taste. Lavinia and Tobias did have a lot of tension between them, although it wasn't a terrible amount of sexual tension in the beginning - they really just seemed to aggravate each other immensely. The dialog was quite witty, the scenes were humorous in some areas. The mystery was there, right up to the very end, you were guessing - I didn't figure out the ending until quite near the end. I think this may turn into a very enjoyable series! Definitely worth the effort to read it!"
1,Very Dissappointed,I own all of Amanda Quick's earlier books. I love them and re-read them every chance I get. I could not finish this book. The two leading character's constant bickering was more than I could stand. This was terrible and very dissaapointing to say the least.
4,Slightly Shady,"I have been an avid fan of Amanda Quick every since I picked up my first historical romance and it was her Ravished. She hooked me with that book. I had never read one before and though they were all silly books. Harriet and Gideon are such great characters. Reading Ravished made me want to go out in search of anything else she had written. After scouring used book shops, books stores, etc. I have most of them and still reread them on a regular basis. When I need a really good read I pull out an Amanda Quick. Unfortunately, all of her books since Slightly Shady cannot compare to those older books - Surrender, Desire, Seduction, etc.... I hope she can find in her writing more characters with that fire, humour, etc... that make you want to keep on reading, keep you cheering for the heroine or hero. If you want a really good book - pick up anything Amanda Quick before Slightly Shady. You won't regret it."
5,"Molly and me in Boone, NC","The highlight of my undergraduate experience in Boone, NC was being an RA and watching this show every Saturday Night with my buddies in my dorm. Please bring this show to DVD. NBC, Lifetime, or whomever is in charge of the rights, please release them. The only other show of that era that even comes close in quality of writing and acting performances is Moonlighting and believe me, we lobbied hard to get that on DVD. Come on, lets get Molly on DVD!"
3,Missing Key!,"I ordered this game even after having read the previous reviews stating that there were missing keys. I hoped that maybe they had the issue fixed. I was wrong. They key for The Dark Crusade was fine, but the key for Winter Assault was missing the end set of characters. I attempted to contact THQ via e-mail and was unable to get an email through to support. I am not too worried about it though, as I really only need The Dark Crusade. Kinda chaps me that they ship a product short a key, but that is not Amazon's fault and I am sure that if I wanted to go through the hassle of trying to ship something back to Amazon from my post they would be happy to help. Alas, I would rather just play my games and go on with life. Looks like I will just get a key from the net."
5,DOW:Plat Pack,"Def a great gaming series, although i'm kinda pissed that DoW 2 hasn't yet been released, but hey who can complain the three of these games are absolutely phenominal. Combining some of the best storyline, and RTS to make one hell of a game."
4,Good and easy read.....,"This was a book that I waited a while to read. I was hooked instantly in the beginning of the story. Linc and Paige are awsome characters, and the heat from the two rolls of the pages. Although I prefer a little more descriptive form for intimate scenes but the message was conveyed all the same. I loved that they brought in the Native American culture here. Genius! Not often to see the traditional side of the NA culture. The suspense part was a little lackign as I figured the plot from the first few chapters. Still was an excellent book!!"
2,Disappointed,"The story line is very weak and the romance between the lead characters was unrealistic. If you have nothing else to do, it's okay but-- I wouldn't buy it. Get it from the library."
5,Best Ever,"I've got to be honest my rommate has had a 360 and he recently got Gears of War. I purchased the new nintendo Wii last weekend and just watching my roommate play Gears on one of our big screens made me go out on friday and buy a 360 and gears of war. I haven't touched the wii in days because of this game. It is by far the funnest game I've ever played. The story is fantastic! The game play is so suprisingly good, and the online has me more hooked than Halo 2. To put it simply my eyes are SO bloodshot from this long long weekend."
4,"A Great Book, But For The Advanced Artist.","The book ""Fantastic Figures: Ideas & Techniques Using the New Clays,"" by Susanna Oroyan is a great book on advanced techniques in clay. However, for a beginner like me it was a bit overwhelming. So I am placing it on my book shelf and hope to be skilled enough to use it some day. As the dolls in it are great examples of OOAKmanship!"
5,Were U-2 was headed,"Rhythm Corps debut album Common Ground is a desert island pick. It is a shame few people have ever heard of them or this album. First time I heard it 16 years ago, I thought it was U-2. It sounds like a Volume II of the Joshua Tree, solid lyrics, solid instruments and searing vocals. The album is full of energy and politcal protest, This band was a staple in Detroit and throughout Canada, a true one hit wonder, that deserved much better support. Anybody that enjoys politcally charged music needs to check out this album."
1,Ramsey Lewis' Sensitivity Is Sometimes His Problem,"Ramsey Lewis' ability to endure as a popular recording artist for nearly a half-century is due largely to sensitivity he has developed as to what kind of album stands the best chance for commercial success.Unfortunately,URBAN RENEWAL, released in 1989, draws upon this sensitivity in a manner that has more to do with popularity than artistry. When he sticks to jazz, Lewis is among the best, but his commercial successes too often tempt him out of the jazz genre. So when he strays too far outside jazz in the interest of making a hit album, the quality of jazz often suffers. Of the nine tracks on URBAN RENEWAL, by my definition, only two -- Berniece and Love Song -- qualify as jazz. The rest is what was in vogue around 1989.I've enjoyed hearing Ramsey live in many venues and own most of his recordings. He has produced many of my favorites. URBAN RENEWAL is not one of them. It barely rates one star."
5,they be tryin to catch me ridin dirty,These tires be fly. They were super easy to install unlike most which are too tight.and the gum walls look super dope on this old Schwinn
1,Poorly organized and written,"Soul Blade is my favorite game, and I found a great FAQ from Richard Uyeyama online that covered how to unlock all of the secret characters, endings, costumes, and weapons. The only thing I had trouble finding online was a moves list (I have since found one), so I bought this book.I usually allow for mistakes in books like these, but there are far too many. No index, poorly designed - hard to flip thru the book to find what you want. Secret codes listed in this book are wrong, or require you to press more keys than needed. It is nice to see all the moves - but they are not detailed (which is a float strike?). Also, the moves lists does not differentiate from ""press"" and ""press and hold"".I do refer to the book on occasion, but I refer to FAQs I have found online more often."
4,Excellent cap for all seasons,"This polyester cap is lightweight, non-deforming, and doesn't absorb as much odor as regular cotton caps. Great for year round use by people who sweat a lot or generate a lot of body heat."
3,"Sad World? No, Long World!","This double CD by Sad World is an interesting excursion into ambient music, but it is rough around the edges. The first CD is enough in itself (at 79 minutes) and is quite good. The opening and closing tracks are superb and my favorite is the 31 minute Glyan which starts with recorded voices echoing from the media (radio or TV?) and segues into long washes of sounds. The 2nd CD is somewhat forgettable with two songs of 40 and 20 minutes in length. The roughness I mentioned appears in some of the tunes in the form of sounds that should have been edited out. On the third song, there's too much background noise and on the fourth song, an unrelenting high-pitched tone is heard throughout--is it feedback? The fourth tune has the nicest melody. I always picture ghosts dancing about. I bought this way back in 1996 on a whim and I do listen to it occasionally, but only 3 of the 7 songs are worth listening to in my opinion."
4,Nicely priced and functional product.,I usely don't give reviews on instrucional type products but am in this case because it is well made and nicely thought out.I don't use it now but it did come in handy initialy when using the D200.The impact of this product is more evident when I look back on just the few specific images I would have not captured if I did not have this quick reference available during my first few days with the camea.It also comes in handy when showing someone else how to use the camera in a pinch.Nice clear type in a well laminated and creased format.Worth the ten bucks if used one time in my opinion.Good luck!
1,Look out!,"Do not purchase this item! Even though it clearly states guest book and pen set... they only send the guest book! Amazon didn't even know and resent me the ""set"" and once again I only received the book! Nightmare!"
3,Poor Customer Care,"I am an ardent online shopper but so far this vendor has proven to be the least realiable. In the first place, the item came much later than they said it would and had to be rescued by my neighbors. I was willing to overlook that but on opening the package to assemble the chair one of the front stretchers seemed to have a fault line and just broke without any pressure being applied. I informed the vendor twice by email and after more than a week have not even had an acknowledgement of having received the email."
1,Save your money!,"Although I did not buy this chair from Amazon, I wanted to leave my 2 cents.At first, I was very pleased with the chair. I bought it to use in my son's nursery to avoid having to walk him to sleep. It worked for about a week, no exaggeration. The bolts continue to fall out of the various holes (holding the arms, back and legs together); I had to add L-bracets at nearly every joint to avoid the pieces from popping out of each other. Worse than that, yes WORSE, it is so very noisy! Every time I sit, rock or try to move/get up it makes so much noise that my son instantly wakes up! I highly recommend that you invest a little more money in a good chair."
5,Switching careers,"Mr.Otterbourg has eloquently written a wonderful tool for all of us who contemplate a career change. It is a primer of practical advice, clearly outlining the challanges one faces in considering a particular career change, ranging from finances, time committment, impact on family and redefining established skills in a new profession. Each career move was illustrated by a profile of a person who actually succeeded in the change. These profiles offered inspiration and encouragement. My thanks to the author for writing such a valuable tool."
5,Fantastic Book!!!,"The author captures the experiences of career-changers across a broad spectrum. If you're a career-changer and looking for more information on the topic, start here! When I found the book in my library, I was feeling stalled in my career-change and felt like it was never going to happen. But, this book makes me feel comfortable in the fact that I *can* change careers and do it successfully as long as I stick to my plan and have a major support team behind me. (I was also comforted by the profiles because many of them changed careers 3-4 times! I'm not alone!)"
2,"OK, I guess","Joe Lynn Turner is a good singer, but there's not much on this one that jumps out at you. The guitar player is kind of back in the mix and sounds like he's playing through 8"" speakers. Not much excuse for a weak guitar sound these days. Fairly generic cd."
5,Feit Light Bulbs,"These bulbs do what bulbs do. Turn them on and they light up. Seriously, they are good bulbs. I have had no failures as to date. I will buy again."
4,Light Bulbs,"I have a good supply now, of 60W bulbs, which were getting more hard to find locally at a reasonable price. Will not need more for a few years."
5,Wonderful book. I highly recommend it!,"THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK FOR ALL ARTISTS WHETHER THEY ARE BEGINNERS OR PROFESSIONALS. THE AUTHOR INCLUDES INVALUABLE INFORMATION ON THE ANIMALS' ANATOMY, COLORING AND MARKINGS, EYE COLOR AND, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE DIRECTION THE HAIR GROWS. I WILL THIS USE THIS INFORMATION FOR PAINTING ON CANVAS, TOO."
5,We won't get fooled again!,"Once sammed, twice shy. Thanks to this book, I'm back on eBay. Well written, informative and an extremely useful yet easy read. Too bad the world needs a book like this, but if you ""eBay"", you better get one. Nuff said."
1,Wasted money,Had try to get this to work couple times - no luck (for all 5 gallons cans). Reached Customer Service and they provided same instructions what I have got from their web site before. Now waiting for replacements.
1,Scepter Eco gas container,"In 2008 or 2009, I purchased a 5 gal Scepter Eco container with a spring loaded pouring spout that is similar to the spout shown. Mine has a red stub that catches on the lip of the tractor gas filler opening. The spout came apart within a year and when I put it back together, the spout leaked. A replacement spout, at Tru-Value Hardware, costs over $5.Recently, the Scepter company agreed to send me a new spout at no charge.29 Sep 12That spout did not work for very long either.I bought another container with this mechanism in 2011 or 2012 and I couldn't get it to work after the first few times I used it. I am back to the reliable funnel now for diesel fuel. I have a small gas can with a slightly different design, that works well."
1,Sony's replacement turns to JUNK!,"We replaced a 10 year old Sony receiver with the Yamaha. It is a very good unit. I wish it had a programable function so the user could name his mp3 players etc. The sound is excellant.JULY 2012 NOT EVEN AFTER A YEAR AND A HALF,THE LEFT CHANNEL IS GONE. I GUESS THIS IS JUST MORE FOREIGN JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Pet cage,This cage is a life saver. It really is perfect for our sick kitty. I has ample room for him and his food and litter box. I would recommend this for anyone who has a small pet and for whatever reason needs too contain him or her.
5,Kodak 1096023 Premium Picture Paper (50 Sheets),This Kodak 1096023 Premium Picture Paper is the best photopaper.
2,mmmm...... not so good,"i was too geeked to get this and when i did it was a big bummer... was not what i expected it to be... i am so glad i didnt spend more than 10 dollars on it, thats for sure and i want that back haha... dnt waste the money"
1,An introduction of an introduction,"This book is intended for a young audience... Avoid buying it in case you take the subject seriously. On the other hand, if you just want to have an overall idea of what IA is, it's ok."
4,"So wonderful, but too short!!!!","This would have been a Five Star review, except (as the title says) there aren't enough tracks. Just as I was really getting into it, it was over. Which was incredibly frustrating, since I LOVED these tracks! Oh well.... I guess I've got to get some more D.I. releases to get my death rock fix."
1,A poor conclusion to a wonderful beginning,"For a series that started so promising, the ""end"" was quite a disapointment. PJF again makes a mockery of the characters which were established earlier, having them engage in completely non-sensical behavior given who they are and what they are doing. He kills off a bunch of characters to establish ""suspense"", introduce a bunch of new characters you couldn't care less about, and then has to make up a last-ditch obstacle to extract any action for a climax - which might have worked but for the fact he has to waste pages and pages extemporizing about the background which he apparently couldn't figure out who to reveal in any other way. PJF tries to set up a cliff-hanger ending, but I, t least, was so uninterested the characters, I really didn't care what happened to them. The first book in this series was wonderful, but the ending is almost insultingly bad..."
2,get what you pay for,"One month after the one year warranty ran out, so did my color tuner. I was Westing HOSED"
1,Lame,"The main character and his friend get drunk, break into a convenience store, and completely trash the place. This is all supposed to be hilarious good fun. Does any responsible adult actually vet this garbage before the filmmakers shovel it out?"
5,Enjoyable for all ages,"I bought this movie because I recently bought a new 3D LED TV and 3D Bly Ray home theater system and wanted some 3D content. I really enjoyed watching this. I think Martin Lawrence and Ashton Kutcher did a great job. The 3D was top notch, among the best I've seen."
1,Disappointing,This is a good example of an animation with a very superficail story line and 2 dimensional characters which you never connect with. It clearly shows the incredible difference between the quality of the releases pixar puts out compared to other studios. I seriously would not waste any money purchasing this DVD.
1,not a family movie,"I just saw this movie and was disgusted by the content in it. It was dreadfully slow, and I was NOT impressed with the scene where Elliot teaches Boog how to 'go' in the woods-GROSS!!!!! Despite the reviews I read this is NOT a good family movie and I strongly recommend that you be careful in who you let watch this movie."
3,Great 3D Experience of A Mediocre Movie,"I had never seen this movie until I bought it on Blu-ray 3D. While it's good for a few laughs, the film itself is not so great. What is great, though, is the 3D experience. The 3D effects are present throughout the whole film, so if that's the main (or only) reason you're considering buying this, you won't be disappointed."
2,"Decent film, but Copies Shrek","This movie is a good animated film, but it has a major flaw. The animation is great or at least on par with what is expected today. However, the film completely copied the relationship between Shrek and donkey. Their banter is nearly identical and copied so perfectly that I found it painful to listen to because it is suck a rip off of Shrek. I found it to be so similar that I could not finish watching the movie. This flaw ruined what could have otherwise been a good film."
5,An Excellent Companion!,"A must for any Christie fan, as it helps you sort out the often confusing array of books by summarizing each of them without giving the endings away, and includes all the title variations that can trip die hard fans up as they accidentally read or purchase the same book twice or more!This book doesn't hold anything back either! For one thing, it reveals that the original title of ""And Then There Were None"" (which can also be found as ""Ten Little Indians"") was actually ""Ten Little NIGGERS""! The poem in the book was the same thing, and there's actually cover art included. Now we have an older edition of this companion than the one pictured here, so it's possible that the publishers have cut back on some of the information available in it, but this is a FACT! Whether it changes your mind about Agatha Christie is up to you!"
3,Quantity Vs. Quality,"I looked at this book briefly at the bookstore before buying this book and I thought at the time, this book had lot of design examples for business cards and letterhead. (one of the reason why I decided to buy it)Well when I actually took time to look over every design. There weren¡t much innovative designs present in this book. Don¡t be fooled by the number of pages. I have to say this book is pretty thick and has lots of examples but not much attention grabbing designs, most design examples were simple and straightforward."
4,Real life,"I read this book the first time 10 years ago. It is neither the best-written nor most important novel I have read during that time but it sticks with me more than any other and I return to it again and again. I think this is because it speaks about how to learn that you are a grown-up when you perceive yourself as the younger, perhaps more adventurous and brave soul you were in the past. As a parent, wife, teacher one often feels consumed by roles that are not our ""essence"". Colwin has shown me that those parts of us can grow together and let us be as brave and as open as our past selves. The added plus is that all of us who imagined (?imagine) a life as a back-up singer for any musician can feel a little less crazy."
4,Hope for the marginal!,"Say you want to live a marginal life. What better than to be the only white chick in an otherwise all-black girl band, Ruby Shakely and the Shakettes?But imagine this: you eventually find yourself married and pregnant, resisting your family's all-out attempts to pull you into the mainstream where they feel you should be. Now that you've taken on such grown-up responsibilities, how do you keep your marginal dreams alive?Volunteer to research black music and make friends with the only mother you can find who isn't wearing a sweatshirt with puffy sheep on it! In fact, you may not believe it, but you can love parenting and still wear leopard-skin tights.This book rekindled my hope that getting older doesn't mean giving in. Somebody's got to support those makers of pink sweatshirts, but it ain't gonna be me! <P"
1,"paper cheap , postage is outrageous",i ordered the paper and i paid more for theshipping than the paper. and the post office wrinkeled it up to get in my mailbox. not happy
4,A bit inconsistent but otherwise great!,"This is a solo CD by famed rock producer Richie Zito who gathered a whole bunch of famous singers who he's worked with to put together a melodic rock super album. The concept is unreal with singers like Joseph Williams (Toto), Eric Martin (Mr Big), Danny Vaughn (Tyketto), Eddie Money (solo), and Phillip Bardowell (solo). The only problem is that some of the songs are out of this world while others are very average. The great songs are so great that they are definitely worth buying this CD but you will probably skip over the weaker tracks. Also the production could have been a little more solid on some songs! I know this sounds weird due to Zito actually producing it but it is true that some of the weaker songs suffer as a result of it. Definitely an album to get if you're a fan of any of the singers mentioned because they do a great job!"
4,Easy to Use,This is a great way to add a second monitor if you have onboard video and don't want to have to open up your computer and put in an additional video card. It's good for web surfing but not heavy applications or video. My TV tuner will not play on this adaptor. but if you just want some more desk space for general use this is a great product.
1,Junk - I woudn't recommend to my enemy,Poor quality video... Very poor... lots of lag and when pressing number keys the window I was working in would jump to another monitor.
3,"Lightweight, easy to use.....but quality of stitching not good.","Overall nice stroller. Lightweight and simple. Lacks anything to hold water bottle up top. But - has great pockets for keys, phone, etc. Easy to fold up and load. Stitching on top of stroller has started to come undone after only 1 month of use."
4,The book was really good.,"I thought this book was really good, although, I hated how Ruby just let everyone walk all over her. If I was her I would not let gisselle get away with everything she did. O.K. maybe I wouldn't act very mad, but I would get very even. I mean come on, almost everyone in this book other than Ruby, Miss Stevens, Abby, Louis, Beau and of course Daddy were total witches!! I do have to admit that I really liked Gisselle's character a lot and If they ever made it into a movie, I would love to play her part. But, has far as the ending went. I would not of gave Daphne the satisfaction of leaving"
5,Normalizes the issue.,"We were sent this book by our pediatrician and it was very helpful to our 8-year-old. The reading level was easier than she is used to but she was able to identify with Andrew. The book normalized her issues (hiding panties, accidents at school) since she feels like she's the only one, no matter how much we tell her she isn't. There's a book about it!"
3,"Blue, but only fluff","Normally, I enjoy the Alice Nestleton series. I love the cats and the mysteries. Other than the information about Russian Blues, this mystery really doesn't have that much to offer. The plot is thin, and the romance pretty unbelievable, and other than her neighbor, I really didn't care about the characters. This is a wonderful series, but I just didn't love this one."
5,Best moderately priced plant/garden problem solver book on the market,"I searched a long long time for a decent, yet reasonably priced problem solving book for plants/gardens. This book had the answers I was looking for; it really is three books in one. There is a section for basic plant maintanence and prevention, problems by plant types (blueberry, apples, roses, exc.), a flow sheet that shows what symptoms will manifest if (leaves, roots, bark, exc.) are being attacked by an invader, and an in depth section on damaging and beneficial creatures (with color photos). This book gives you everything you need to get started and problem solve your plant or garden. A solid book, and a good investment."
2,Don't Insult Bruce,"Why write a song like ""Cars & Girls"" which diminishes Bruce Springsteen who is five times the artist Paddy McAloon will ever be? In the years after Paddy wrote this song, Bruce wrote Streets Of Philadelphia, The Ballad Of Tom Joad, My Hometown and many other meaningful songs while Paddy was writing drivel like ""The Wedding March"". I do think Paddy has written some decent tunes,such as ""We Let The Stars Go Out"" and ""Appetite"". I just don't see the need for tearing down another musician--especially one with Bruce's talent and integrity. But, if you want to tear him down Paddy, I'll say I have to agree with the Amazon reviewer who said some find you pretentious. Some of your songs make me want to hurl."
4,Indepth coverage and understanding of Reflexology,This is a great book that fills in the gap on understanding reflexogy and how it heals the body along with detailed information on how to do reflexology sessions and correct methods. I'm a current student and was left with many questions after my classes and this book clearly filled in the gaps.
2,boring,I'm sure this book has a lot of info but I couldn't make it through the first chapter. I also felt it was outdated.
4,great book,"I would recommend this to anyone expecting their first child! It was a great read, not just for 1st time moms for anyone expecting."
4,raw and powerful,"This is totally unrefined Janes Addiction. The live arrangements are solid with tripping, 1% and pigs in zen soaring with excellent riffs by Navarro. Perrys wailing is solid and the acoustic versions of Lou Reeds Rock and Roll and the Stones Sympathy being real highlights. I wonder why these acoustic versions never get any airplay. This is a real glimpse at early Janes."
5,Wonderful Fiction,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Jacob's Ladder. The characters are very real and engaging, and the historical references - battles and home life - make you feel as if you are right there as they take place.If you like this book, you may also like Stonewall Jackson's Gold (sort of a Civil War Treasure Island, but a true story) and On the Occasion of My Last Afternoon (a postwar fictional memoir of a woman who lived a very interesting life during the war)."
2,Myths & Stereotypes,"I thought Mr. McCaig's writing was good and the book kept myinterest. But I was disappointed that he perpetuates the myth of evilSoutherners. His original title for the book was ""The Worst Cause"" and the book is written with that slant. From reading the book you would think that 96% of all Southerners owned slaves rather than the 6% which actually did."
2,Sally Hemmings meets Gone with the Wind.,"Well, in light of the fact that one of the fastest-growing past times in America is to beat up on the South by portraying all white Southerners as racist, conflicted, and pitiable creatures who had an insatiable appetite for ""brown sugar"", I'm not really suprised that people liked this book. It's well-written, but extremely unfair in its portrayal of Southerners and a little sketchy on some historic facts."
3,Compelling historical drama,"I was impressed by the way in which McCaig wove historical facts into a compelling human story. The battle scenes were particularly affecting. I was disappointed, however, in the superficial treatment of the characters. Their mortivations and choices were never well illuminated. It might have been more effective for the author to delve more deeply into the lives of fewer characters rather than try to include so many as important players in the story."
1,Cracked,This item has been shipped twice to us both times damaged. The glass on the middle dial is cracked! Continued replacement does not make it high on our list!
4,"Nice looking, good value",The barometer has been unreliable. I have adjusted the calibration 3 times but now just accept it as +/- 10 millibar
1,Cheap,We needed this to regulate the house so our solid Italian wood furnitune doesnt dry out too fast and become ruined. When we opend the box it was shifting loosly around from lack of proper packaging and was broken. Now we have to return it and wont be buying another one from Amazon. It was rather dissapointing.
1,merely decorative,"The barometer and hydrometer do not work. I've compared my readings to local weather stations on the net, and they are not even close. I've tried tuning the readings with a small screwdriver to no avail. The holes in the plastic case the manufacturer left in the gauges for tuning do not even fit a screwdriver.I wanted something simple and reliable that did not require batteries, but this is not it."
3,No real bonus,"My review for the no-bonus track version has also been used on this one. However, I should point out that the original version is superior to this one. Bonus tracks are generally a mixed bag, and with a live album probably more so. Thus, a once decent album is junked up with pretty disposable extra live tracks. I can't see anything to recommend this version, songs like ""Straighten Out"" and ""Peaches"" sound odd when out of their original late 70's context."
4,Great Cam,This camera is a great deal. I especially love its zooming capabilities since I bought it to tape my friends snowboarding. Another great feature is the high resolution lcd screen which cuts time off of the editing process. Also very durable.
1,NBKrap NUmber 2,"God these guys suck! Thank God they dont rep my state, id move. This cd is good for one thing a coaster for my drink."
4,nice 4 the price,"I've had ear phones be for, so I know how nice they can be. I also know that they become uncomfortable after wearing them for a while. The RP-H21 are pretty nice for the money I spent. Great sound - I forgot how nice they can be. I'm listening to the Holiday CD by Hans Zimmer now using the earphones - awesome. I am getting older, and have to admit that my hearing isn't what it used to be. The earphones bring quality to sound that I have not had for quite a while. Very clear, good right left sound separation (when the source has that), and great low sound range that I really didn't expect. Yea, they are a little uncomfortable after you wear them for a while, but the beautiful sound outweighs that aspect. Compared to the older earphones I used to have, the RP-H21s are much lighter and much more comfortable."
4,My Opinion of the Panasonic headphones,"They are great, except for one thing. I don't care much for the way the ear-pieces are made. They hurt my ears. I was hoping for some kind of padding on them. They sound fantastic. But they were just a little bit big on my head. Otherwise, I love them."
3,"Nice headset, great price!","This is a good headset at a very reasonable price! Not the most comfortable fit, but still a good bargain!"
3,Not good for kids,"These are perfectly decent cheap headphones. Fair sound quality, not bad at all for the price. Where they fall short, however is the size. Amazon returns these in a search for either kids or children's headphones, and they definitely are not. They're adjustable, but normal size. If you want a pair that fit a toddler, look for the Sony or Philips or others that are specifically sized smaller - there's definitely a difference."
1,Great for the 8 months that they were alive,"I was very pleased with my $5 headphones since the sound quality was actually pretty good, and thought that I'd beat the odds and gotten a good pair of quality headphones that would be with me for a while. Alas and alack, it was not meant to be. About 7 months of regular use led to the demise of the headphones, which apparently should be treated with great care and attention. The earpieces came off one at a time, and then the arm broke off.Until this happened, I would have sworn that they were not only a $5 cheap piece of &$&%^ but now, its clear that in this day and age there are no bargains...you just get what you pay for!"
1,Don't Do It,this is crap. after ONLY a month the right side has gone out. AND they don't even stay on your ears where they're supposed to be. i;m sorry i wasted my money. more like a crappy rental than a purchase. the ONLY reason this even has one star is because amazon doesn't accept no-star ratings.
4,Great cheap lightweight headphones,SOunds fine for the gym or for exercising. Lightweight. Won't replace $350 headphoens but at this price is good bang for the buck for a cheap pair to knock around in
5,A steal,"I was looking for some new headphones because the ones I have the ear pads were starting to come apart (if you own cheap headphones, you know what I'm talking about). I start looking around for some that I could get for a throwaway price and I come across these. I look at the description and I think it's too good to be true. But, it's less than five dollars (at least when I bought it) so I buy it. The first time I put them on, i don't believe what I'm hearing. I have never heard sound that good coming out of something this small and this cheap. Even my dad was impressed by it, and he's a professional mixer. If the price stays this good, I may get more of these the next time I need to replace my headphones."
5,Five stars for value,"1) These are not great headphones2) These ARE great headphones for the price3) Pretty good bass and high-end, but they lack mid-range presence and detail4) If you need a pair of headphones for casual listening that you don't have to worry about losing, these are a deal at $5 (you could buy several pairs!)5) Headband is easy to adjust and stays at the length you choose6) Cord is a good thickness and doesn't conduct sound if you're jostling it7) If you want open-air outside-of-ear phones that sound better (and cost more, but are good deals at 40/20/80 respectively) consider Koss Portapro/Sportapro or Grado 60s"
2,Good if ALL you want to hear is bass,"Based on reviews of the great sound quality, I foolishly ordered two pair. Such a low price, why not? THIS is why not -- if all you want to hear is bass, these might be ok. But they have very little range. The sound was tinny and I regret the purchase. Unfortunately shipping to return them will cost almost as much as the items, so in the junk drawer they go in case all my other headphones should break. Lesson learned once again -- you really do get what you pay for!"
2,Cheap item do not expect much from this,Cheap itemdo not expect much from this headphonesreally Does not deserve five starsBecause of the sound is not clear and easy to broke
1,Breaks easily,"Given that I paid only about $5 for these, they weren't bad for the 2 weeks or so that they were in use -- until today, when I was trying to adjust the leftside piece and it broke off in my hand. Cheap plastic!"
2,WIll not adjust small enough to be worn by youth (age 10),"Seem to be a decent value, but please note that these will NOT adjust small enough to fit an average 10 year old."
2,Great Sound but TOO BIG,"Great sound, very light, with little pressure on my ears, but they are TOO BIG for my female adult head. When I position these where I want them on my ears, there is about 1/2 inch between the top of my head and the band. If you have a smaller head, I would recommended looking elsewhere."
3,"Good headphones for the money, but doesn't work for us.","The sound is good, and it couldn't have been easier to use. Our only problem with it is that the cord is way too short for us."
4,Great Sound - Slightly Loose Fitting,"First of all please realize that these are only $5! Hard to beat that price. The sound quality is superb and the bass is where these headphones standout. For the price these cannot hardly be beat.. a real no-brainer. The only downside is that these headphones are the old style fitting over the head and they do not fit snug to the sweet spot of the ears if you are exercising hard. Anyone who has ever owned an older style knows what I am talking about. Maybe a headband or something when jogging will get these bad boys fitting snug right up to the ear consistently. Anyway, they are loud so this is by no means a deal breaker. If you are sitting down or moving casually about then the headphones will stay in the sweet spot of the ear with no problem. You can spend more money... but for what."
3,Good Sound,"Good Sound, but uncomfortable ear pieces. I had to put extra cushions over them and turn them upside down. Back up pair, not for long term use."
4,Not bad,I just wanted a pair of headphones I could use on my laptop and Kindle and on airplanes. Considering that I paid less than $5 for these headphones they are good value for money. The frequency range seems adequate for listening to classical music and the bass was better than I expected.
3,Non-adjustable fit is a problem,"I'm continuing to use these headphones with my iPod when I walk because they're lightweight and have very good sound, but they're not really comfortable because they're sized for a larger head and can't be adjusted."
5,Awesome headphone,I bought these headphones for my birthday on his birthday and it lasted 6 FULL MONTHS. so much better than those overpriced ones
4,Good bass but tight grabbing,"much better bass compared to smaller drive earphone. I wish that the head band has less pressure on ear. Not sure if this will reduce the quality of sound. The wire length is longer than my other headphones, I like it."
3,"Good product, but...","Good product, but the cord is way too short if you plan to use it with a computer that sits more than a couple feet from you. It would be nice to have an adjustable volume control on the cord, too."
2,Panasonic headphones,Not up to the standards of good headphones.For some reason sound clarity is not good.Not satisfied with the purchase done.
3,Not great for computers,"I bought this headset so I could listen to music on my computer. The sound was too quiet, much quieter than my older worn headset, which is nothing fancy (I wish I still had the packaging or specifications for that one.) So I plugged it into my Ipod, and it was acceptable. But the iPod is the only thing I can use it for. I had high hopes because of all the good reviews, but I guess I'll have to keep looking."
5,for the money they work great,very happy with the headphones for the price. they might be cheaper elsewhere but not by too much. sound is good overall.
5,"Great Headphones, Great Price","I use these headphones in my line of work, and I always buy them in twos, so as to keep an extra on hand. Great price and a quality product. I even bought a couple extra for my children to use in the car when listening to movies on their dvd device."
3,Too tight,"The headphones are a bit tight on the head. And by a bit I mean a lot. I might be able to stretch them out to a wearable level, but if I can't, they will be returned."
4,headphones for the Kindle Fire,"These headphones are just perfect for my use. I wanted them for the sound while watching movies on my Fire. Without them, the sound wasn't great, but using them has made a big difference. I can also watch a movie without disturbing anyone else. I don't think they would probably be the best for high fidelity music, but for my purposes they are great. For the price, you can't do better."
5,Great headphones!,"Use them in the gym. Suffered ear pain one too many times from earbud cord getting caught on something - ouch! So I'm revisiting the 80's with these comfortable, SAFE, headphones! Great price! Recommend them!"
3,Lightweight Panasonic headphones,"All I can say is you get what you pay for and these headphones were especially cheap ($4.92). They reminded me of the ones that came with the old portable CD players.My biggest complaint is that they don't fit snug on my head so the sound volume is very low. The earpiece is made of foam padding. If I press the ear cups to my ear, the sound is ample and very clear. But I wouldn't want to hold my hands in that position for very long.I plan to invest in a good full sized set of headphones to get the fit I want. I am not concerned too much about portability since I usually listen to music in my recliner. If I were into aerobics I would probably stick to ear buds. For my listening pleasure, I would prefer padded ear cups that surround the ear and keep out noise."
2,Good for kids or people with small heads,"As it says in the title, they were to small and therefore uncomfortable for a man's size head. They would probably be okay for a kid especially for the price."
2,No volume control,"After I bought it I realized how volume control feature is important for me, won't buy it again. I use it at work and I need instant volume adjustment."
2,Could nave been better,"SILVER CITY could have and should have been better. As a political satire it works well. However, this single element can not carry this film. It fails in every other department. What's worse, is that the script asks the viewer to remember a host of character's names in order to follow the story. This does not work at all and is unfortunate because I felt this film had all the makings of another sleeper hit like LA CONFIDENTIAL."
5,A book to devour like a Hork-Bajir,"This is a cool book. But sadly, I lost mine. You see, I hidit. I did that because every time I saw it I had to read it. So oneday I decided to hide it. I put it under my matress. My family and I were in the process of moving and it got lost with everything else. I couldn't find it. I hope I find it, because it's a book that you don't need to see it to need to read it."
5,couldnt put it down!,"This book was great!I recomend this book to everyone who likes to read about aliens and outerspace.Before you read another ""Animorph"" book you should read this book.I recomend this book to people from 12 and up!really"
5,This is a totaly cool book and you all should read it,I love the Series I love this book I love Kathren Applegat
5,Whoop Whoop!,"Animorphs was the first book/series of books that captured my imagination. I began reading them when I was in second grade, and was easily hooked. I'm 24 now, but I still remember going to the book store in the mall every single month, religiously, to get the newest book! The lovely ladies at the store new me and new me by name. I would highly recommend these for any parent to try for their kids, and for any kids to read. Years later I still have all of my books, as well as all of the friends I gained through the books. Some of them are married, some are jet setters, and some, like me, are hard working americans trying to live month to month - but these books will ALWAYS link us. It's actually through one of those friends I learned about the re-release with the new covers. You can bet these will be going in my collection."
5,Wow!!!! The Animorphs are very Cool!!! I see a yeerk! Not!,"I have every Animorphs Book and I think Applegate is a cool writer. He has a good imagination. In this book five kids: Marco, Rachel, Tobias, Jake and Cassie went walking home together and they saw an alien spaceship land on an empty construction sight. A dieing Andalite (a good alien) came out and told them about the invasion of the evil yeerks and gave them the power to morph. At first it felt like a dream, but then they realized it was real and started to fight against an evil Yeerk called Visser 3. What will happen next? Bye Courtney HavenThats not my real name. I don't want the yeerks to get me."
5,I love Animorphs!,"Well, now I've got all the Animorphs till #28 including Megamorphs and the Chronicles, but I decided to write a review for this one, as it is the first one. Animorphs are probably the best books I've read. Katherine Applegate could be the best author I've come across. I think these books are really well written and funny, and it amazes me how things link. The Hork-Bajir are said to be peaceful, and such. Much, much later it's said they use their blades for harvesting tree bark. She couldn't have planned *that* far ahead... Anywhooey, I really love these books..."
3,Not Impressed,"I like a bit of Janet Evanovich's work however based on the description of this book, I started reading this just a fun quick read not expecting much. I should have expected less. Many books like these I can get past the ""unrealistic-ness"" however this book to the ""unrealistic-ness"" to a whole new level that I just couldn't see past."
2,Not so inspiring,"I tried to give this a listen, wanting to broaden my horizons a bit. However, I found I could not take his 'teachings' very seriously given his wildly inaccurate 'facts' about hypnosis which he uses to support some of his beliefs. I found it as if someone was trying to prove the existence of God by using as evidence the fact that the sky is green. If your evidence is that faulty I have a hard time listening to the rest of your argument. After getting through the first tape I skipped the second. I'm sure there is better material out there."
1,Terribly unenlightened,"Reading a previous ""review"" i bought this, it is a complete waste of audiotape.. Osho changed his name from Rajneesh after the scandal(s), didn't know who he was when i bought this. Avoid it."
3,some one was absent...in that cafe,I cant imagine a philosopher cafe without..Nietzsche...but it was good to finish the book with Nietzsche's words... Its a good book for kids and adults..
3,"For inexpensive dresser, not bad","Purchased as a set, with two of the matching nightstands and the armoire. Assembly is VERY time consuming and the wood is a notch better than super-cheap; it's still not the sturdiest of materials and what you expect from a dresser not of solid wood. The finish is attractive and cleans easily. The dressers themselves DO have a funky smell to them (could be from the laminate material?) but with some drawer scent pouches, faded away for me. The overall look of the dressers is what I wanted and looks attractive as a bedroom set...better alternative to the real thing if you're on a budget!"
4,"Looks beautiful, but a little time consuming to assemble","I just bought this piece as well as the nightstand. My father and boyfriend (both with furniture assembling experience) spent about 2 hours on the chest. I strongly suggest using a power drill for screwing in the many components, as well as using a higher quality glue than the one provided. Although a little tedious to assemble, the furniture looks great and far more expensive than one would expect. All in all, I love this piece of furniture and highly recommed it."
2,An almost perfect bracelet.,"I have rather slim wrists and this bracelet fit perfectly. The beads are very nice and smooth and I enjoyed very much wearing it for the Thirty minutes I did wear it. The quality of the string for this bracelet is embarrassing. This bracelet popped off less than 30 minutes after I first put it on, and when I say popped off I mean the string snapped and the beads went flying. I have not yet contacted the seller, as I'm most likely to just buy some stretch string at a Craft Store. For the price I love having this nice set of Onyx beads, and the string will be cheap to replace. Other than the poor quality of the string, this is a great bracelet. (BUY EXTRA STRING)."
2,Be Carefully,The bracklet looks nice but its not made for everyday wear. Mine popped during the a super bowl party. I only got to wear it for a month.
1,emergency disaster survival guide book,weak. poorly organized and constructed. very little new ground explored. of less value that basic Boy Scout handbook. Sorry I bought it. Hope no one who really needs survival information thinks this book will do it.
3,"Well, I wouldn't buy this one..","See that ""enhanced"" tag they stuck up there? That means hey kiddies! We $&#*ed this one up so we hope you buy it! The bottom line is, Strapping Young Lad is the best band to have ever graced this earth. So In essence, I bought this CD, second (in my opinion) only to City. And i was listening noticing things were different from the album I'd also purchased on Itunes but decided to get a hard copy. Songs like even the masterpiece Love? were shortened. I can't condone the purchase of this CD, it is still good, but have you ever heard a critic say it could have been better? Well it could have, and it WAS!!!!!"
4,Oh you people...,"It's very funny how all you reviewers and listeners out there think of this album. Emotional lyrics? Haha. If anything Davin is poking fun at metal not bein emotional about it. Listening to this album makes me want to laugh just because of that. But I have to admit that this CD is pretty heavy. Not near as heavy as what I usually listen to, but still heavy. Heavier than metalcore at least. A good listen and far better than metalcore. A good listen if you are ok with someone poking fun at metal while being heavy."
4,The last good SYL,"This is the last of the good SYL albums. Heavier than a Really Heavy Thing started the chaos. That album actually SCARED a few of my friends!! No joke -good stuff indeed. Then City came out and took it to the next level. City, IMO is still in my top ten albums of all time -one of the heaviest things you will ever hear. Alien came along and is almost as heavy and pounding as City. The song Zen is one of their best ever. But this album is where you can definitely hear the change in style starting to take place. The album after this one almost made me sick -it was terrible... and embarassing!"
5,Easily the best SYL album,"Strapping Young Lad is an odd group, to be sure, but only they could take chaotic, insane, and just plain weird extreme metal and make it so enjoyable. A friend showed me this CD, and after listening to the first two seconds I said, ""I have to own this."" I have owned this album for a little over a year now, and I have to say it gets better every time I hear it, and I listen to it a lot. If you like your music to be subdued, homogenized, and repetitive, then steer clear of this album. SYL is pure insane fun, and ""Alien"" is the best example of this. If you haven't heard SYL before and you're looking to pick up their best album, look no further."
3,"O.k., but lacking...","I thought they did a pretty great job of keeping it original to the book, which I loved, but it felt rushed and some of the humor just wasn't there. I would love to see this turn into a series,though.I think it could really have a great fan base and be able to expand into one of those shows that you wait for every week. I'm already wondering if their going to make a Two For The Dough!"
4,One for the money,"Myself and all of those who follow the Janet Evanovich series enjoyed the movie.I would love to see the other 18 books in movie form. I do think that some of the humor, which is the very heart of the books, was missing. Put more of the humor in the remaining 18 films and these could outdo Harry Potter."
4,Not who I pictured as Stephanie,"Katherine Heigl was good even though I never thought of her in the lead character, the story moved fast and was entertaining. Almost as good as the book"
3,Great Movie - Love Heigl,"I'm a fan of Katherine Heigl from Grey's Anatomy and I've liked nearly all of her movies and this was no exception. Lots of comedy, action, and a bit of romance. Only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because it is oddly similar to Bounty Hunter except reverse the roles."
3,Movie good but picture unfocused.,I liked the movie but several times during the movie the picture was out of focus. It was disappointing to watch with an unclear picture.
1,save your money if your a fan of the book and read it again,"First off, I did read all the reviews before watching..still took a chance because I seem to be more tolerant watching movies that were made from books than most people I know. I know they can't all be spot on. Secondly, I have read the book and loved it so very much. That said, if you have not read the book you might enjoy this movie more because you can't miss what you don't know. I found this movie to be very bland personality wise, under character developed and very disappointing; mostly because the best parts of the books were the characters and their various attitudes and personalities; they were not shown as well as they could have been in the movie. In the books all the characters esp. Lola's and Grandma Mazur's antics among others were what kept you in stitches; Do yourself a favor and read the book instead, you won't be disappointed."
5,Stayed close to book,I thought the movie stayed close to the books. I wold love to see this in a television series or at least more movies!!! So much more to he story the movie didn't cover to add on!
1,Capitol BAD,"Katherine Heigl has no pizzazz whatsoever needed to play Stephanie Plum. What a terrible film voice. From the moment the title credits rolled to indecipherable lyrics and bland graphics, I had a bad feeling. Who ever cast this should be shot out of hollywood in a cannon. Debbie Reynolds is still too vibrant and beautiful to be Grandma. Where were the accents. Could not get past the horrible casting to even finish the film. What about a soundtrack. This film has no music to carry it along. Stale, boring and completely flat. Evanovich, you shouldn't have sold out."
3,A serious cop show it is not,"Taken for what it is, a light comedy, it was okay. Katherine Heigl is quite attractive which made it worth watching."
3,"book is great, movie's dumb",Movie x 1000 = BOOK.....get the book.I need to write more so it can post my review...Some inate problems with the characters:1. Katherine Heigl's too pretty2. Debbie Reynold's too pretty3. Sherrie Shepherd's too pretty4. Daniel Sunjata looks like he's 12 and not pretty enough...sorry Danny.5. Jason O'Mara is pretty but too old...sorry Jason.Read the book.
2,not crazy about it...,"I love Janet's book, and I thought the casting for the parts did not work at all...the books are way funnier than the movie,and both morelli and ranger could have been sexier and hotter that the guys they casted.it was entertaining, but not even close to what the books portray..."
3,Book is WAY better,I love the Stephanie Plum books by Janet Evanovich. Read the books instead - movie was cute but missed so much of the feel & character of the books!
1,Seriously?,Katherine Heigel is awful! the fake accent is just horrible. It was so distracting that I couldn't even make it past the first 15 minutes. Trying to hard to sound like your a jersey girl is the worst! No wonder this one's free.
3,Where is the humor????,"I thought the casting was good for the most part. However, I want to know if the screenplay writers read only the one book or the series of book? I ask because grandma and the funeral homes are such an important part to all of the books. All of us true fans of the books we know the story lines and know when it wasn't followed. The development of Lula and Stephanie's relationship was just skimmed over. The humor was completely moved. If they plan on doing more Stephanie Plum books, then please add humor and follow the story line accurately. Each character has their own little quirks that makes them charming. This movie lost the nuances of the book."
4,"good movie, love pittsburgh!",Love the fact that it was filmed in Pittsburgh as I happen to work right up the street from where some of it was filmed. I also had the pleasure of meeting one of the actors. So of coarse I had to see the movie! cute and funny and worth watching!
2,Less than meh,"She's hot, that's about all this movies has going for it. Cliche after cliche (sassy black hookers & a crazy grandmother, who's ever seen that in a movie before?). Didn't care about the characters - struggle to get through the entire movie."
1,defective,"I bought this and didn't watch it right away. when I opened it the disk had blotchy white spots all over it. When I tried to watch it, the movie would would stall out i would get past it by playing with it only to have it stall out again, this continued through the movie and would usually get stuck so that I couldnt finish it.Very disapointed :("
2,One for the Money review by Katie,"I had such high hopes for this movie. I love Katherine and all her past movies. Unfortunately, this movie was not so great. I fell asleep"
1,Did Janet E approve the script???,"Just finished watching the movie (paid $6.50 DirecTV). Are you kidding me? Hated it!! Ranger? Come on!! Joe? Are you kidding?? Did they like each other? Katherine kinda grew on me as the time ticked by. Too short of a movie. Lula was not what I hoped for!! She was a ""HO"" who wore a lot of spandex!!! Didn't see much of that. Don't think there will be a sequel. So Disappointed . . ."
1,Extremely bad movie,"I expected to be disappointed in the movie after I read the cast of actors. I was even more disappointed after renting the movie -- thankfully for only $1.00! Bad casting, bad acting, bad directing -- didn't even have the proper car for the movie . . . all around a dud. I have watched some bad movies in my time, and this one is one of the worst. If possible, I would give it a negative five-star rating . . ."
4,Very Funny,"My family and I laughed throughout the movie, it was very enjoyable. Ktherine Heigl was very good in her role."
3,Not to bad!,"I am a huge fan of the books, and I was both excited and dreading this movie. But it was much better than I thought it would be! I rented it this time but will be buying next time!"
4,Trailers did not do the movie justice,"I did not have much interest in seeing this movie. I have not read the book series the movie is based on and the trailers made the movie look dull. However, I like Katherine Heigl and was looking for a light movie to watch so I gave it a try. I found the movie to be very funny in a tongue in cheek way and found the characters to be very endearing (except for the Jason O'mara character which I thought was awkward). Ended up watching the movie twice in the 24 hour rental and found myself wishing I could watch the characters in a different storyline. Wish they would do a second movie though that's unlikely seeing that the movie didn't recoup it's budget. I think it would be great as a campy TV series but Katherine Heigl and Daniel Sunjata would have to be involved."
2,less than the sum of its parts,"Lots of good scenes but it didn't add up to a good movie. Good acting, good directing, lackluster script? Perhaps."
2,Not so good,"Not sure what the problem was with this film, but I was highly disappointed. There was no chemistry between the two leads, and the story a little far fetched."
3,An OK movie,This movie ha d a predictable plot other than that I like KH.It ran very smooth streaming and that was nice.
1,Horrible,"Horrible casting, terrible acting, awful screenplay. Stick to the books, they are so much better. I don't understand how Hollywood always screws up a good book."
3,First in Series,I enjoyed the author's first book in this series made into a movie. I was interested in seeing who would play Joe and Ranger.Good story line without too much depth.
4,I hear Stephanie Plum,"The movie was just as funny as the books, I can't wait for the others to come out. For the most part the movie did a good job of staying true to the book!"
2,one for the money,"We were very disappointed The books are so much better than this movie. If we had not read the first book we would have been lost. We were wondering why, at least thats the way we felt, did they take out some of the more humorous parts. For instance the funeral vistiations along with several other parts. We felt the movie was base on the sexual tension between Ranger and JoeFor us no need for a sequel"
2,Why did they massacre this movie?!!?,"This movie was great in the theaters! Some of the best scenes were of the crazy antics of Debbie Reynolds. When the DVD came out, all of those scenes were gone. We bought 2 copies go the DVD and returned them, because it was a shell of the theatrical version. If you liked it in the theater, don't buy this version as you will be very disappointed.Madmaxmama"
2,One For the Money a bomb,"As an ardent Janet Evanovich reader I was excited for the first movie offering but I couldn't have been more disappointed. The plot moved along at a clip and the bazaar elements were there, but the casting was all wrong, failing to capture the essense of the characters as we have come to know and love them throughout 18 volumes (19 out this fall). I suppose a viewer who has not read any of the series might enjoy the giddiness and unlikeliness of the plot, but for a seasoned Stephanie Plum fan it just fell flat."
4,great movie!,I was hoping that i would like the movie....AND I DID!!! Loved the books; Can not wait to see if they have another movie!
2,Terrible,"When you're 15 minutes into a movie you get to view for free and want to no longer watch the rest, it's not a good sign. I don't mind Katherine Heigl, but the accent is terrible and the fact that she's continuously narrating her own actions is incredibly annoying, especially when she's pointing out obvious things that don't need to be narrated. I don't need you stating that a car was yellow when I can see that for myself. Only reason it didn't get 1 star is because the grandmother is pretty funny with the few parts she has 30 minutes into the movie."
1,Couldn't watch more than 15 minutes,"I've read all of the Stehanie Plum's novels and enjoyed each one. This movie lacked everything worth while that brings readers back to each new book. Don't waste your time watching this one; find one of the books, read it and enjoy."
4,Cute & Enjoyable,Sadly it seems all of the funny clips in this movie can be seen in the previews/trailers. Not exactly the Action packed film I expected but still enjoyable to watch.
2,Bad casting!,"Janet Evanovich's story is great. Unfortunately the movie was barely passable, and all because of poor casting. Too many of the essential, and well loved, characters were ruined by poor portrayal. Very sad!"
2,Disappointing Product,"Black & Decker makes pretty good light-use power tools so I figured this oven would do the trick too. Not so. The ""convection"" fan, which didn't noticeably improve cooking from the start, ceased operation after about 10 uses and after about 3mos. the toaster function quit. This was not from high volume use - we're talking one person using it about 2-3 times/week and mostly on toaster setting. The only way is works now is on ""oven"" setting. This product is weak for the $50-plus price tag."
3,Basic,"Not a lot to say about the product, basic loader, good price, received on time, works as advertised, light weight. Is that 20 words ?"
3,"music CD - ""Bird: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack""","The product has been received on time and in good conditions.The overall quality of the music CD I purchased(i.e., the custody, the CD cover, etc.) is good.However, there is a scratch on the CD support that corresponds to adamage of the recording #9 (the music stops for some secondsand ""jumps"" to the end of the recording).Apart from this, the other recordings are good."
4,Good live set but cheap production,"Ska Revival / Trojan Box Set: Trojan produces cheep box sets and this is no exception in that regard, but this one is generally better in content. This one is mainly Live recordings of various quality (from good to poor), yet there are some very excellent live performances preserved here. Overall, this is one of Trojan's best box sets, as long as you are not too fussy about quality. While this is good, there has yet to be produced the kind of anthology of Ska or Two-Tone music that would do the genres justice. However, this one is still enjoyable and worth having. Four Stars"
4,This is real Music,I grew-up listening to this music i must have seen the movie a hundred times if you want a blast of the past buy this CD.
5,"It's my girl, what can't I say","I have had this album for years, brought it on cd play if often Ms.Franklin is my girl..............."
3,Decent item but could use better instructions,"Mount works well, but the installation instructions are a bit vague. Also, single bolt which holds the platform to the arm is hard to adjust properly. Might benefit from having a better attachment system."
5,"A cheery, warmhearted read!","Enchanting tales of man v. beast, ok man v. a cute, fat squirrel, will keep you wishing for the simple days and make your attention turn towards the wonder of the outdoors. All the pranks and inventions will keep you happily confused on who to root for. Wonderful to share with the family on a cold winter night by the fire!"
5,Great show!!!!!!!!!!,"I absolutley loved this show from the beginning! It is so original and funny, and they couldn't have gotten better actors to play some of the greatest characters in television show history."
4,Price for these DVD's is insane!,"""Titus"" was probably one of my all time favorite shows, and as I was telling a friend about it I was gearing up to order all three seasons.That was until I saw the prices - $93.00 for new box sets and just under $50 bucks for used?What in the world is up with that? Amazon has great pricing on most of their season box sets of TV series...Why is this obscure show so highly priced?"
4,A great underrated slow jam can be found here,"Obscure and soulful singing duo who never really made it big. Not absolutely amazing, but worth checking out (at least when these stratospheric prices go down). Contains the gorgeous slow jam ""You And Me"", which was rumored to have gotten airplay on some specialty slow jam stations when it first came out."
3,Enjoyed this book & a helpful tool,"I found this book to be quite helpful when I was diagramming a poem for a college course. However, it was quite vague in other ways that would have been more useful, such as how to diagram the parts of a sentence more specifically for advanced grammar. I still recommend this book, and continue to look for others that are more informative."
4,Sister Bernadette's Barking Dog,"A fun read ... especially for those who are interested in English, and even more special for anyone who had to diagram sentences in elementary school."
2,Book | is \ frustrating,"I consider myself quite the word nerd and started to read this book with great interest, but I found this book very frustrating. It started off well, suggesting a memoir of a life diagramming sentences (a craft I learned in the fifth grade) but soon turned to a mind-dulling treatise on the arcana of diagramming--without even any instructions for the uninitiated or out of practice.So besides that headache, readers looking for Catholic humor or sepia-toned trips back in time to a pre-Vatican II era will be greatly disappointed. However, SISTER BERNADETTE'S BARKING DOG would make a fine gift for your favorite English teacher now living in the retirement wing of the convent's mother house--but for no one else."
2,CHOOCHOO DERAILS,"Filled with every cliche imaginable, DEATH TRAIN is one of those films shot in Bulgaria that tries to emulate both the US and Mexico. Action star Bryan Genessee is starting to rival Stephen Baldwin in his low key, somewhat soporific performances. Bentley Mitchum fares somewhat better as the truly psychotic madman who is holding a trainload of caricatures hostage. We have the asthmatic priest; the pregnant lady; the crippled boy; the young newlyweds, etc. The henchmen are just as bad as Mitchum including the requisite female who is just as dangerous as her male counterparts. The action sequences are tired and unimaginative; and the director uses several of the same scenes over and over in trying to fill the movie's extended length. Few movies have ever made walking on top of a moving train look so easy. Avoid unless you have nothing else to watch."
2,"S&S Fan, but Not This One","Just to give you an idea of where I'm coming from, the Emma Thompson version of ""SENSE & SENSIBILITY"" is one of my Top 10 favorite movies of all time. I've read the book twice. And so I was curious to see how an early BBC production of the story played. In a word, ""Disappointingly"". The key word is really ""early"", as in, ""this is an early Masterpiece Theater type production that looks very much like a filmed stage play"". In other words, the production values are weak. More importantly, passion is also lacking - both that provided by the actors (who seem stiff and plain) and that experienced by the audience. The movie version proved that S&S can have both scope AND passion. This mini-series did not."
2,Too Slow.,"Staged sets and no personality breaks believability, in this earlier, 1981 version. Compared to ""Pride & Prejudice""-2006, 1996, & 1940 all at 5-stars; and the Emma Thompson version-1995, at 4-stars.This film should be used in a film school, to show what happens when: no additional lighting is used outdoors = (shadows on the actors faces), no boom-mike = (distracting noises), ill-plotted camera-angles = (the camera comes into the viewer's mind), and no transitions, indoor to outdoor, or room to room, and staged-sets = (does not take you there).So, they had a low budget. If you view it as a college play, do not mind ""reserved"", and ""slow"", and are a big Jane Austen fan, you may enjoy it. I recommend instead, ""Middlemarch"", skipping the first episode; and ""Maytime"", watch first 5-minutes, skip 10-minutes, then the movie takes off."
1,Overrated!,"I was really eager to watch this film after reading all the praise it has received in the reviews, but I must say I found it quite disappointing.The language sounded either lifeless, as if the actors were just reading aloud from a script, or completely overdone and unnatural. The sets looked like stage decorations and the actors stiff and uncomfortable. As a matter of fact, the whole film seemed more like a theatre play than a movie. The screenplay of Ang Lee's version might take some liberties with the book, but at least the characters are lively and credible!The worst letdown was the end after Episode 8, though: Marianne batting her eyelashes at the Colonel, remarking that she would have to ask him lots of questions - and her mother commenting ""Children"". And that was all! Am I missing a DVD??"
1,Not terribly effective,"Product is supposed to work up to 10-12 feet, the spray actually reaches 2-3 feet. I was terrorized by a stray dog while trying to unlock my car. It didn't do anything until the dog was practically in my face and then the dog was back after I had entered my car but before I had the motor started.Not what I paid for."
2,On the fence,"I have not been attacked by a dog since purchasing this product so I really can not honestly give my opinion on how effective this product is. I can however, give my honest opinion on the packaging. I do not like the clip that is provided on the top of the can. The dog repellent that I purchased before this product had a plastic ring at the bottom of the can with holes in it and a removable chain was attached. It was easy to clip on a wrist strap and could be accessed quickly if needed. I am disappointed in this packaging and I am considering looking for a different product. I should have observed the product more carefully before purchasing."
1,doesn't work,This product seems to have no effect on dishwasher odor. I would definitely not recommend it.
4,Alan Ryan sets new limits for weird tales!,"The short story anthology, Bones Wizard, is a trip into an extreme twilight zone. On the surface each story is bizarre and shockingly original. Read them a second time and you'll be twice shocked."
1,Review,"I USE to own this CD,but, I hated it and therefor... did not listen to it much at all. I ended up donating it to the local Library."
5,80's Rock,"I really like this record, but it's not at all what you would expect from Dickey Betts. There isn't a trace of country in the entire album, and only a hint of blues. Instead, this record is pure 80's power rock. If you remember how guitar rock sounded in 1988 (when this was recorded), you will appreciate this record.If you are expecting another country-flavored ""Highway Call"", or some straight-ahead Allman Bros blues, forget it, this record will disappoint you. But if you enjoy hard rocking guitar, this record features two of the best in Betts and Haynes.One more reason you may be interested in this record... I believe this is one of the earliest recorded pairings of Warren Haynes and Matt Abts. They, along with bassist Allen Woody, would later form the power-trio-jam-band, Gov't Mule."
5,Myllarit - Eta Pravda,"This is the latest compact disc still found the legendary group of Karelia, a region on the border between Finland and Russia.I have had less luck Myllarit other celebrated local group, the Varttina, but they have in their music the same expressive power, the same vivacity, the same harmonic beauty. The traditional dances and songs of Karelia are interpreted with a single explosive energy, which makes it sound very contemporary. This compact disc will not be reprinted because the leader of the group died recently, so it will be considered a collector's item, like the rest of the compact disc Myllarit unavailable.A must buy!"
1,weird second hand,I bought two from Amazon.com. One is good. The other one's second hand walks every 4 seconds. Don't know if it is a fake.
1,Bad Book!!,"I recieved this lift-the flap book, witthout the flaps. No where in the description did it expain parts of the book were missing. Very Unhappy!!"
2,"Great book, but flaps are too thin.","This is a cute book, but the flaps are VERY thin and easy to pull off. My 20 month old tore a few of the flaps off hers and unfortunately tore all of the flaps off a neighbor's book! She is very good at reading books, even on her own, and has never torn another one."
2,chicknscratch,"This book is okay, not as good at the other two lift the flap books. The flaps ripped off easily on this one. Not sure why."
2,Just okay,"When I opened the book, on the second page one of the flaps were missing. Further down, I realized another was missing. Probably won't use this book much since its somewhat confusing without the flaps."
2,Tear Alert,"This book is very cute, however, the flaps tear very easily. My little one had the flaps gone before I could blink. He loves reading and turning pages, if you have a hands on child, this may not be the book for you."
2,Chico & Rita,The copy of Chico & Rita was a European copy. Would not play on any of my DVD players. Had to reconfigure my computer in order to play on any computer. Only allowed to reconfigure 4 times. Disc is virtually useless to me. The other items were great. All items delivered in a very timely manner.
4,"If you like legions, you'll like this","Turtledove is one of the ""greats"" in sci-fi (and Alternate History). And for good reason. Misplaced Legion, a generation after it was written, is as good as the day the Videssos saga began."
5,An All-Purpose Photography Book,This photography text is recommended for learners in or out of school. It offers both a general and in-depth comprehension of the craft.
2,A pleasant mediocrity.,"Good-natured but one-dimensional story about a a lazy-ish girl from a ridiculously driven family who decides, partly to drive her parents nuts, to try out for the cheerleading team. There's one pretty powerful scene involving the family's misguided attempt to take her out to a celebration dinner, but the rest of the book seems to wallow in shallowness. The characters just aren't fleshed out enough...no one will stick with you after the book is closed. The story is so lightweight, in fact, that I'm surprised Cooney wrote it, given her knack for complex, offbeat, memorable characters. Go figure."
3,Nice idea,"Nice looking and seems like good quality. Just seems to do a lot of slipping on our seat. Of course we have a Keekaroo, and while this cover was recommended as universal to both, it was not the best purchase. But for the price-it gives some cushion and my daughter likes the print. I just hate having to adjust it all the time. Next time I will spend the extra money for the better cushion-also not cloth with a Toddler! A lot of cleaning, and we have a neat and pretty skilled eater....."
1,"You could write this, too","Save your money. ""Rainmaker"" reads more like the ""100 Best Ways to Lose Weight"" pamphlet for sale in the grocery-store check-out line. Sure, Fox captured all the basics of rainmaking. But the elegant packaging is worth far more than the content. The book designers get 5 stars; the content is probably on the web for the price of a few minutes of searching."
1,Beyond Bad,"I can't believe someone was paid to write this. I can't believe that I wasted my time reading this. This is so bad that it is comical. I particularly like the chapter recommending that Rainmakers buy shirts without pockets so that they won't be tempted to put a pen in their pocket which could then leak and be distracting to their customer and ""...decrease the odds of making a sale."" It's a sad commentary on our society that pablum like this is considered wisdom."
4,Sell it like it is,"I finished this book within 3 days. It sure gave me some pointers on selling, but have yet the opportunity to apply most of the tools considering that I just finished it over the weekend and am writing this review on Monday. Am sure this book is like most ""business"" books, in that it is obvious and common sense. However, if only we APPLY just 1/5 of it, we really cannot tell if its a great book."
1,For stupid salespeople who don't know anything,"I've met a lot of stupid people in sales roles. This book is for them. This book has a series of super short chapters that recite inane little ""truisms"" about how to treat everyone you meet as a potential goldmine, blah blah blah.Becoming a rainmaker takes more than just memorizing where to sit in a restaurant, asking a client if they have their appointment book handy, etc. You would have to learn how to create pain where no pain existed, and build desire to sooth that pain. I didn't find any ""how to's"" for those needs in this book. No wonder our economy is in the [toilet]. Stick with Solution Selling and SPIN Selling for quality advice."
3,"A good quick read on selling, but not really for pros","This is not a book for seasoned sales veterans. I would recommend it to people just getting started in sales. For them it offers good practical advice on how to think, act and work with clients.If you are a sales pro and need a pick-me-up, then give it a try, otherwise you'll be disappointed."
2,Sales common sense,"I had hoped for more from this book.First of all, it's a very quick read. I read it in one lunch hour, and that's not skimming. It's very basic English, simple sentence structure, general maxims. It's more like a morning pep talk to sales pros rather than a treatise on rainmaking. Nothing complex, nothing confusing, nothing intuitive.A lot of it came across as common sense to me. I think you learn these lessons the hard way when you run your own business for any length of time.I think it would be a fantastic book for corporations to hand out to employees as a mandatory read - too many employees see the impact of their jobs ending at the borders of their desks. It would also be a super gift for someone starting their first sales job. And it might be a nice pick-me-up for sales pros who are feeling a bit burned out.But if you're an experienced pro, you're not going to find many revelations here."
3,Not what I expected,"This book was promoted by a visual arts newsletter for art marketing. It has some helpful info but by and large it is geared towards industrial products, not fine art. It does, however, promote professionalism which I find useful in any marketing situation."
2,Does not work with S&W J Frame Revolvers,I have a s&w 638 in .38 and this does not work well with it at all. The product itself holds the rounds firmly in place. However the diameter of the speed loader is to large to work with the J frame. The cylinder is too close to the frame and the speed loader hits the frame and grip causeing the bullets to enter the cylinder at a angle. So when you release the bullets you have to shake the speed loader and jimmy it for the bullets to fall in. It would be much faster to load one at a time or with a speed strip.
2,doesn't work on Charter Arms 38,"This was suppose to fit a S&W Airweight 38 so figured it would work on the CA also, but the grips interfere."
4,Not a perfect fit for Taurus Model 85,I'm not sure there is a perfect fitting speed loader for this gun. But this one does work. A bit akward with such a small frame gun but with some practice It does work. I think if you have small hands it would work better. It still beats loading one at a time.
3,A S&W Airweight 642 Review.,"I would have given it five stars, but it didn't fit for my Smith & Wesson Airweight 642. My revolver has a wooden laminated handle that has quite a low profile. It seems that for the Airweight the cylinder does not swing out far enough for the speedloader to insert the cartridges in without being obstructed by the handle. My bro also has an Airweight but it has a rubber grip. I doubt it will work for his, but if it does I promise to update this review. In the meantime if you have an Airweight 642 with a wooden grip, don't bother with this speed loader."
5,needs more description,"Had to return product c/o it was a 5 shot, made for older model revolvers. Was easily returned, correct speedloader found and ordered."
4,HKS Speedloader - Ruger SP101,Works well with my Ruger SP101. The locking mechanism holds the bullets securely and product seems fairly sturdy (the black part is plastic but the locking silver knob is metal)
2,S&W Model 642 38 Airweight J Frame,"The speedloader was advertised to work with this model. If the shells are pushed all the way in the cylinder the loader becomes wedged by the grips. If the shells are only inserted partially, the loader may be used.These are good loaders, but do not fit the S&W; 642 Airweight, with standards grips. If this loader was used in poor lighting conditions, or emergency situations, it could be dangerous."
4,Impressive play,"We liked to read this play even though it is a tragic story. The father left his family a long time ago and so Amanda ( the mother) had to bring up her children of her own. Now she is looking for a gentleman caller for her crippled and shy daughter Laura. Her son, one of the main persons in the story but also the narrator, earns the money for the family. But he isn't satisfied with his job at the warehouse and with his whole life. Well, if you're curious now how the story will go on, then you have to read the play. The story is full of symbols. For example the glass menagerie is like Laura, very fragile and tender. It also shows the unrealistic world in which the family lives, especially Laura and Amanda. We really can recommend to read this play. It's really great."
3,"Amanda: ""Rise and shine""","Tom: ""I'll rise but I won't shine"".An interesting play that fit the Zeitgeist and the spleen of the era and the playwright."
4,A Sad Girl,"I remember watching a film adaptation of this book, and I distinctly remember my impressions of it. The sister did not come across as ""lazy"" to me, as one reviewer stated Laurence Olivier thought. She seemed depressed, a deep unhappiness, as if something had wounded her at some time. There was more there than met the eye. I found the story depressing overall, a real downer. But most Tennessee Williams stories aren't uppers."
3,Not only a normal play,"it's a typical book you have to read twice. Between the lines there is written a lot. The whole play makes you hopeless for this tragic family. I couldn't feel with Laura, she drove me furious with her shyness. She is so apathic and without power. Amanda plays her roles perfectly, like in a theater. Tom is the only ""normal"" person and he does the right thing when he goes away. But he will never leave the family behind him, because he too, he has his problems. This book is a therapy for people who want to commit suicide, because it gives you a compulsion to life. After this book you are so greatful with your relationship to your family, that you love the whole world for a few days."
2,Dissapointing....2 1/2,"I hoped that this would be as good as either of Debbie Gibson or Tiffany's 80's albums, or anything by Samantha Fox, but it's not. It isn't as consistent as anything from those artists. It's predictably front loaded with some of the better songs, and then after 'Toy Soliders', it goes down hill. Not that anything aside from 'Soliders' is really all that great to begin with. Only the first four songs are any good. 'I Feel The Earth Move' is okay, too, but it's a cover. Everything else is limp and poorly written, especially 'It's Not What Your Doing'.Martika is the prettiest of the 80's teen bubblegum pop singers, and 'Soliders' and 'Love Thy Will Be Done' (from her second album) really are respectable songs, but she always sounds like she's SHOUTING the lyrics. Thankfully, she toned herself down on 'Martika's Kitchen', which is a better album."
4,Romer transcends the physicality of love.,"Romer spends most of his time on the continent, and it shows. His poetry is full of landscapes reflecting the history of Europe. These landscapes are at times mental and at others physical, but ultimately allow the poet to understand his own loves. And these loves are multiple. We travel from girlfriend to Poland, from parent to France. These travels also enable us to see how Romer constructs his vision of England. An outside view in. The third part of the book relates Romer's stay in Poland. The poems here are more political, though many are laden with Romer's quintessential romanticism. However, some of the longer poems let him down. He's good when he's brief and he should keep this in mind. Romer is definitely worth a read, and he's a breath of fresh air. Especially if you feel like you've just received a good bashing from the onslaught of the NewGen product. Romer isn't a product, he's a poet."
2,What's in the box does not match the product description here.,"Be very careful when ordering this product. The keyboard itself is great, but in the Amazon product description under ""What's in the Box,"" it states that the keyboard comes with a stand. It does not in fact come with a stand. All you'll get here is the keyboard. I ordered this as a Christmas gift, so this was very embarrassing and disappointing. In the end, I returned the keyboard to Amazon, and purchased the exact same model from Target for a lower price, but with the stand and AC adaptor included!"
1,rip off,why are they splitting this into part 1 & 2but too make you pay more while giving lessepisodes and wrong music(Business Ethics) take more and give less!!!!!!!
5,Interested in DVD when it becomes available.,We fondly remember early seasons of My Three Sons with Fred McMurray. We eagerly look forward to having them available on DVD.
1,No guarantee they will issue all seasons.,"This looks like too many other partially released shows. Season one and then nothing.I for one am sick and tired of buying a season or two and then finding out the studio does not intend to issue the rest of the series after the fact. It's not just Paramount either, but all of them. Does anybody else own season one of Amazing Stories, or what's available for Malcolm in the Middle.I vow to no longer purchase any partial TV Series. I will only purchase COMPLETE SERIES OF ALL SEASONS of old TV shows. Like MASH, STARGATE SG-1 etc. That is the correct way to do it. Get with it studio's do it right, do it complete, or don't do it at all."
2,MY THREE REASONS FOR NOT BUYING THIS SET! BOYCOTT THIS GARBAGE!,"It's a shame to have to give this release such a low rating, but I have my reasons......:-) Three of them!1) Too expensive!2) Only a half season set!3) Music has been changed!If studios are going to release our favorite shows, they need to do it with care and respect for the show and the fans who want to spend their hard earned money to take a trip down memory lane. When we wait this long and then find the shows aren't intact and altered, it leaves the viewer with a very bad taste in their mouths! To make matters worse releasing half season sets to squeeze every last dollar out of fans is totally shameful and I suggest no one buy this junk and send a strong message to the company responsible for this! Too bad I was looking forward to this release!"
1,My Three Sons DVD's,Thank you ALL for the reviews. I recorded these shows when they were on Nite at Nite in the 1980's and was waiting for the uncut release of this WONDERFUL show on DVD. I would have been heartbroken to see or should I say hear what they did to the music. I will hope and pray they re-release the original UNCUT shows. For now I will save my money. Thank you again old TV fans.
5,Awesome To Read!,"This book is very good because it deals with the struggles of friendship, being poor and difficult relationships. Even though much of the things going on are sad, it is written so well that you don't mind reading about it. There are parts that are funny, but mostly it is about being human and what we deal with in life emotionally and physically. I just think it is a really cool book! Cathy Cassidy is a great author - I have also read her book titled Dizzy. It is a good one to read, too."
4,A girly-girl book.,"Indigo Blue's mum loves the colour blue- the sky, chlorinated water, practically anything blue. But life has been pretty bad so far for Indigo's family. Especially when her mum is physically abused by her step-father and runs away with Indigo to a little apartment, far, far, away. At least life at school is sunny and bright for Indigo. Indigo's best friend- Jo always makes Indigo feel better, she's care-free and doesn't care much about anything and never ask's Indigo about life- which is really bad. Life graddually starts to shine when Indigo's mum gets a job and their house begins to look nicer and nicer each day. But life soonsoon darknes when Indigo's step father returns- and when her best friends decides it's pay-back time.This is a heart-warming book about love, life and coverage, and has a beautiful, happy ending."
5,Outstanding book!,I have bought a number of books to help me maximize Elements. This is the very best book by far.
3,Scott - forget the comedy!,"If you looking for a quick starter, a 'click-by-click' approach, this book is for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere. No theory, not referenced well. The author's constant attempts at comedy are extremely annoying and waste a lot of the reader's time. All of that paper and ink would have been better spent on useful information. This was my first Photoshop Elements book and after a few chapters, I am already looking for something else."
5,An Excellent sequel to Found Dogs : Tales of Strays Who Landed on Their Feet,"I originally bought Found Dogs : Tales of Strays Who Landed on Their Feet and fell in love with the book. One of our kids Miles is a rescue dog and I can definitely relate to the stories in that book and this sequel.This book is twice as big as the first and the stories are just wonderful. The stories are pretty much everyday people telling their tales of giving dogs a second chance at a great life. It made me feel great to know that there are others in this world who take care of their dogs as much and sometimes as nutty as my husband and I do :). If you've got a furry friend, this book is SO worth it - another 2 paws up from this pack!"
5,Excellent schematic and pictorials support text,"This book covers fundamental electronics with excellent schematic and pictorial diagrams to help the reader understand how tube radio components work. I especially liked the explanations of each stage from power supply through detector and audio amplifier, and the descriptions of the functional elements of each tube. There are many useful tips for selecting and installing replacement parts which I highlighted for future reference. Yes, there are more typos than normal but that is a minor nuisance which doesn't reduce the value of the content."
4,"The All American Five Radio: Understanding and Restoring Transformerless Radios of the 40's, 50's, and 60's","This is by far the best resource for new Antique Radio enthusiasts who are interested in restoration. The only criticism I would offer is that the index is not as complete as such a reference work deserves. Otherwise, this is a clear, concise explanation of the inner workings of what has to be the most common radio type of the period."
3,A promising start but a disappointing ending,"I received this book as a Christmas present. I read it in entirety and was a little disappointed. The end was convoluted (if not near incomprehensible) and there was some genuine character confusion as well. I believe it is still a book worth reading, but not a truly landmark literary accomplishment."
3,Tragic,"Like many liberals, I had little time for the Gingrich revolution and was convinced it would wreck America. Since my predictions were made in half jest, even I could have not imagined the cavalcade of stupid comments and smug answers.For a party allegedly oppsed to government waste, Newt and company were perfect poster boys. Between government shutdowns, airforce one tantrums and partisan investigations, they did a pretty good job wasting the tax payers money.Rather than trying to salvage his repuatation (what little there is)we get more of the same self-serving garbage. Newt, apparently unaware that his fifteen minutes of fame expired long ago, has again set himself up as a deranged messiah. One can gradually ernvison his head expanding to scarier proportions in each chapter....I'm glad I was not around to clean up the resulting mess.Devout newtoids will like this, but the majority of intellegent readers will not."
2,Won't drop all the bullets,I ordered two and one works fine and one holds one and sometimes two rounds from dropping . The drop cam holding the rounds does not retract all the way on the same cylinders. Too much hassle sending it back so I'll try fixing it myself.
3,good,I would recommend. I use it. I got excellent results. practical and washable. copper brush is also necessary for clean of bore
1,Very Bad Book,i am a 4yr. electronics hobbyist i agree this book is very confusing it starts with hardly the foundation of the basics then goes right into the theories assuming you have prior knowledge of it!!! i suggest you go to your local book store and grab Teach Yourself Electricity and Electronics by Stan Gibilisco asap

5,The only book you need,"I've read hundreds of self-help books. When I first read this book 10 years ago, it changed my life. No other book had that power. It gave me the insight to heal all my emotional problems. Partially because this book poses no ""short cuts"" and is very real. Any negative reviews on here--I've noticed--were written by people who didn't really read the book."
1,piece of junk,"I bought this as it was highly rated by Cook's Illustrated. It's a piece of junk, didn't even last 9 months. The lever snapped right in half. Wine Enthusiast wouldn't replace it, won't buy from them again. Save your money and get something else from someone else."
2,Disappointing,"I needed to know more about Sarbanes-Oxley for work and ordered this book. While I was waiting for it to arrive, I went onto the Internet and downloaded some information, including the text of the legislation itself.I read through the legislation. I'm not an attorney, and I wasn't motivated to cross reference the other laws/acts mentioned. In other words I just read the legislation as is, with no legal background.When this book arrived, I expected it would provide information and/or interpretations that I was not able to get directly from reading the legislation and other free materials.In truth, I found there was very little, if anything that I hadn't gathered directly from my other sources. If you are trying to learn what Sarbanes-Oxley is about and choose not to use the available information, this book does describe the basics.I would not recommend it, because it does not significant add to, or simplify the information readily available for free."
4,A classic story takes a new form,"A very classic story takes a new form here- two old women are the victims of betrayal from their tribe when it's too cold to continue to support them. The two women must venture out of their own and make a life for themselves. The book comes full circle when the old women themselves are in the position to save the tribe themselves.The story of the courage to overcome the odds, and the stregth and struggle of the two women is a wonderful tale. Classic in that you learn you should not over estimate anyone, and you never know who in life you'll need. It's a touching tale, and well-told. It's a quick read."
2,cheaper else where,"I saw this tiny jewel box for $4.99 at Home Goods. The idea that they want $17 for it is , wow, for something so small."
5,mm jacket,this live album flippin rocks. they have an awesome live sound that sounds so real and together as a band
5,Must read for the technologist!,"Great book, wealth of knowledge and insight, a must have for the CTO or person with a role in managing technical direction or technical strategy. Mark has a deep understanding in global sourcing and leveraging technology for competitive advantage."
3,"A ""Regency Romance""","If you read the definition of the Regency Romance, it will say that the book tells the story of a young girl's introduction into society which ends in marriage. Every now and then, I come across a Regency Romance which is just that.This romance has no dastardly villians, no spies, no magic or time travel, no murders or thefts, and not even an elopement. The hero and heroine are utterly conventional, well bred, and not witty. That being said, I have to admire Ms. Buck for taking on such a task as writing a book in which so little happens and making it pleasing and a least somewhat plausible."
3,with ajusted,"I boy this product and, not just the price, was the look that cot me. I has to do a little ajust to fit it, after that: It work perfect.Thank you."
2,adequate at best,"I suppose its because technology wasn't the best at the time, but the sound quality leaves much to be desired. It gets a bit better as the tape goes on, but overall would much rather have a DVD."
1,How sad!!!!!!,How could a literary company like Scholastic put THIS out??? It almost hurt my heart to read what I read of such a sickening book. This is stooping to the lowest of levels to appeal to children. The used price of 01 cents (when I looked) should tell you all you need to know about what it is worth.
1,Unimpressed,"I don't mind potty humor. Even though I'm a mom, I have my kids pull my finger all the time. I think the Dav Pilkey books are funny, however, The Day My Butt Went Psycho isn't. I was willing to accept that butts could detach themselves from bodies. I found the grandmother amusing. The idea of Zack's butt attaching itself to the faces of statues made me laugh.But then we got to the stadium filled with thousands of butts, which no other human, with the exception of the buttcatcher, in the town managed to notice. We find that the butts are self-aware with minds of their own and compare their situation to that of slaves. When they ripped the head off the buttcatcher, that's when I decided I wasn't interested in the rest of the book. I was willing to continue reading it to my sons (aged 9 and 10) if they wanted, but they thought it was absurd too."
5,"New Packaging, same great show","I purchased this season because someone lost the very first disk from the first box. I've got every Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis season as well as the movies. The story line is great, although toward the end of SG-1 it appears they were running out of bad guys to save the world from. Still, the character development is great, and there is a lot of thought-provoking subjects."
3,a kids review,"This is absolutely one of the best yugioh decks out there!If you need good cards to build a new deck from this is a great deck.You get the Gadgets!!!!!I will rate the decks.1. Zombies madness2. Dinosoaurs rage3. Machine Revolt4.Spellcasters Judgement5. Dragons roar6. Invincible fortress7. blaze of destruction8. fury from the deep9. lord of the stormIf you could, you should make a cyber chimiratech deck. Hope this helped."
2,Yikes,"There's a reason Crowler lost all the time in Yugioh GX. It's because the Ancient Gear monsters suck. A couple of good support cards are in here and Mechanical chaser is in here, but other than that this deck is not worth it."
5,This is a must have!,This is a must have item in my house...its perfect for warming up muscles that hurt...great for headaches and sinus issues and for cold winter nights.
4,bed buddy,good item to have on a cold night or anytime of the day to releive joint and musle pain. would recommend it to those 45 and older for immediate relief from normal aches and PAIN.
3,Bed Buddy,"Good service. This item does not have enough ""stuffing"" in it. Is quite ""skinny:. Other than that, it is fine."
3,Feels nice but cools down quickly,"I love the size, shape and feel of this item even with the stitching down the middle.It takes about 2 minutes to completely heat up, however it loses heat very quickly - perhaps after about 20 minutes.I'm not going to return the item, because it actually does feel great, the heat just doesn't last very long."
4,Doesn't get as cold as my old one....probably great for warmimg,"Small too. I still use it, but don' like as well as the one I got at a mall in the 90's."
1,Celiacs beware!,"I am allergic to wheat and this causes me to get hives. It should have a warning label. If it has oats, it is likely cross-contaminated with wheat."
5,Great gift idea!!,I purchased several of these for gifts this year. You cannot go wrong and I think it's a perfect gift for anyone! Works well for those sore/aching days. Used it for the first time at work from a co-worker and have recommended it ever since!
4,Wonderful hot back to come home to,"It does get a weird smell when you heat it up, but it keeps the heat very well, heats up quickly, and will make achy shoulders or lower backs feel better at night."
3,Unexplicably bad quality,"Believe me, I wanted this to be great. Anita is fine, but the sound and especially the video quality is second rate. I'm assuming it's videotape, which should be crisp and clean. It's the early 60s, so sound recording was top notch by then. I've gotten spoiled by the Jazz Icons DVDs put out by Reelin' In the Year Productions. They have stuff from the 50s that will knock your eyes and ears out. Until they can find, or get the rights to, some cool Anita O'Day footage from the 50s or 60s, this Tokyo DVD will have to do, begrudgingly."
2,Materials are too flimsey and the sizing range is too wide.,"When a child is going to be playing with a product, it needsd to be constructed of more durable materials. This is not the case with this item. It is made of very flimsey material. Also, the size range is too big. Small, medium and large should be eliminated and costumes should be made according to size, i.e. 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, etc."
1,false advertising,"I ordered this movie expecting the class of 1999 2 the substitute, however i received the original movie with the second movies dvd sleeve. I then tried to contact the seller and they didn't and still will not respond to try and rectify the problem. This seller obviously does not understand anything except how to rip off people since I have read they've done this before."
3,"Fun game, despite the bizarre inventory","I have to admit I had to consult an on-line walkthrough for this game, more times than I had to for any other game, including Myst Revelation. Even with the walkthrough, I had problems applying the inventory items sometimes, but the story is fun, and in spite of, or maybe because of this, I enjoyed the game. Character movement is limited, the backgrounds tend to be static, but still very pretty."
2,Really disappointed!!!!,"I was surprised that this game played as badly as it did. Mostly illogical inventory puzzles that required putting objects together in ways that you would never think of without a walk-through. The game, while visually appealing, was somehow not gripping or motivating. It just wasn't challenging, logical, or enjoyable to play."
1,Worthless,"This is supposed to be a jacket with adjustable armband to use with my Shuffle. When it arrived, I could not believe it. The on-off switch, as well as a non-existent shuffle on-off switch ( there isn't even one an this device ) is PAINTED ON the outside on the leather. There is no access unless you take it out of the jacket every time to turn it on. Nor can you feel through the leather jacket to push the switch on. Nor does it look like the item pictured. It is absolutely useless, besides being cheaply made. It's draw is it is inexpensive, but spend a little more and get something functional."
5,Save your fingers,"HKS makes a great product. I own the 541, 940 and 943 for various different firearms. Each one works great,"
1,POLES WAY TOOOOOO WEAK - BENT!,"We purchased two sets of these poles - hired someone to put them in properly, and when they put the lines on and just barely started to tighten them, the poles both leaned inward.... bent towards the lines. Now they have to go buy a heavy steel pole to put INSIDE each of them since they are set in concrete. They are just way too weak, and come in three sections, which make them even weaker. I would never recommend these for any use! ... but certainly not for clotheslines with the tightening of the lines, and the weight of the clothes. What a disappointment."
5,My 100-word book review,"Edward Armstrong Bennet was a friend and contemporary of Jung's, and his book What Jung Really Said is a lucidly-written overview of Jung's psychology and its development. This is a slim volume, and Bennet does not venture into any of the controversial depths of Jung's thought; however, it is a concise introduction to the subject, for beginners. There are some interesting gems of information, including the fact that Jung studied both Chinese and European alchemy. Also that Jung had dinner with HG Wells, who then wrote a story based around Jung's idea of the collective unconscious; I hadn't known that!"
4,It works!,"This is a nice little speedloader for the price. The rounds don't fit 100% secure when locked in place, but this hasn't been a problem for me.I will be buying another. 4/5 stars, and I only took one star off because of the slight ""jiggle"" of the rounds when it is locked in place.It feels like quality material, and it works quick, releases the rounds when you want it to, and is a good fit on my S&W; model 10 .38 special."
4,Good speedloader at a good price,These plastic loadrers work well to quickly reload your revolver. Lightweight and those that were stiff to rotate freed up quickly and work great.
1,Not for beginners,"The back of this book says simple enough for beginners, but IT IS NOT! I think if you have been over physics before this book ""could"" be helpful, but not for someone seeing this stuff for the first time. The refresher part only states some facts about pre-physics material, but doesn't explain why it is stated. The tests after each chapter ask about material outside the book that is not even covered. I will be taking this book back for a refund and getting the ""for dummies"" version."
2,Fortunately Amazon offers The Best of Mathis Output,"Don't lose your time. Mathis has made it much better. It was a big sin that he has recorded ""Since I Fell for You"" again. Happily, Amazon offers the re-issue of the original recording - the album ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face""."
3,Couldn't Get Into This Stuff,"I suppose the music of the 50s just isn't my cup of tea. Mathis' vocals sounded uncharacteristically harsh on some of these songs, like wind blowing up against someone's Venetian blinds. I give five stars for the gorgeous, tastefully-done cover art, which is much better on the LP version than the microscopic CD cover, and negate some for the performance and the material."
4,Ismaelo at his best....,"After going on his own, this was one of his first recordings. It was for the TICO label, one of the salsa labels in New York at the time, released in 1972.Allow me an aside about one of the sidemen in this recording;Manolin Gonzalez, the alto player in the session, was a personal friend and business associate. Born in the Dominican Republic, Manolin spent some time in Chicago, where we met, shortly after the record came out. He had put a band together in Chicago and they used to rehearse in my apartment. It ruined my relationship with the neighbor across the hall.This album and the other TICO Ismael Rivera records are among his best.Enjoy..."
1,Still Waiting..PATHETIC!!!!!!!,I ordered this product on September 5th.. and its October 10th today. I am still waiting.. This is so agonizing.. I called Amazon Customer Service and they said its not available from the seller.. Then why is Amazon listed as the seller???They are trying to please me by providing Normal Shipping and not even expedited one!! Haa..They have changed the estimated shipping date once and that too only after I called.. Today is the last day for the est. shipping date.. And I am sure they are gonna change it again.. This is pathetic..The WORST EXPERIENCE I ever had with Amazon.. Be aware of the long wait before ordering this item!!!!
1,waiting...,order this item only if you do not need to use it immediately and can wait for a long time. i do not know how long because i am still waiting!
4,Essential for Lewis Carroll fans,"Lewis Carroll was in ""real life"" Charles Dodgson, lecturer in mathematics at Oxford University and author of books on geometry and logic. Mathematics intrudes into his children's books, especially Sylvie and Bruno. There is nobody better qualified to explain this side of Lewis Carroll to the non-mathematician than Martin Gardner, author of the Annotated Alice and for many years the compiler of the Mathematical Puzzles column in Scientific American. This book will delight Carroll's many fans and may intrigue many who would not normally be attracted to children's fiction. I also recommend the two books on Lewis Carroll's puzzles by Edward Wakeling; as a professional mathematician, he brings a complementary perspective."
3,Good product,This cradle is very cute and the perfect size...however we had to reinforce the side with carpenter's glue because it was quite flimsy. As long as you don't mind that extra step it is worth purchasing.
4,Solid game,"I bought this game for my 6 year old.He enjoyed it a lot. It was semi challenging for him. There were several areas where he needed my help, but, I would say he was able to complete about 90% of the game by himself.There were several puzzles he needed to complete to move on. Of these he probably needed my help on half of them.He probably finished it within a week and wished it would have taken a little bit longer, but, he has had fun replaying it.Overall, it was a good solid game for him. Enjoyable and semi-challenging so he felt like he accomplished something."
5,Great game,I purchased this for my grandson for his birthday.He loves spongebob games.I would recommend this game to anyone who loves spongebob.
5,THIS IS THE BEST CD HE HAS EVER MADE,I WAS NOT A FAN OF HIS BUT THIS CD OPENED MY EYES TO THIS YOUNG BROTHER'S TALENT. I LOOK FORWARD TO HIS NEXT CD.LINDA
1,This album was far from Veteran material,I was like ok last album marques put out was ok.... so I put this cd in the car and i was like I got ripped the hell off I need my money back... mostly of the songs some the same and he sounds very bad vocally like he is stuggling for his life in very song. This cd just plan sucksssssss
3,not what I was looking for,"The author indeed provides a lot of info about ancient Buddhist cosmological models. There isn't a whole lot on the ""philosophy"" part though - the author provides a lot of details but not much on why I should be interested in them. I was hoping this book would elucidate some deeper meanings in these models, but again and again you're just presented a bunch of facts presented rather indifferently, almost getting a sense that the author himself finds the material boring and uninspiring. If you're simply looking for reference material on Buddhist cosmogonies and/or are interested in them simply for their own sake, I'd say this is would be a good purchase for you."
2,Jarring,"Was too shrill and odd for our five and seven year old. Woke them up. Not soothing in tone or content. Old school audio quality and music.Would be ok, though strange, for, say the car. If I had paid twenty bucks for this, I'd be bummed.But I bet this lady is great at an event. Just not bedtime."
4,A good book to read to your child,"This is a Spanish version of Aesop's fable about the raven who is thirsty but can't reach the water that he seeks. He learns to drop pebbles into a crack until the water level rises and he can drink. It's a charming story that is told with bold & attractive illustrations. The Spanish is very simple & easy to understand, & my child loves it."
4,I ordered the wrong model of this device,"Due to my ordering the wrong model first I had to return this one but the correct one arrived a bit later and works just fine, much better the my old thumbs:-)"
3,GOOD ...... IF IT WERE RIGHT,"This is a good product, to be sure. The problem is that the item I was sent did not match what was pictured, so it did not work for my application. Amazon was quick to resolve the issue in a most convenient manner. Thanks Amazon, but please be sure the product matches what is pictured in the future."
4,Neat,"Neat trip hop, I am playing it in my store right now. Hard to find anything else of this band though, although they are set to make an appearance on the Matrix: Revolutions soundtrack."
5,So good it should be made into a movie!!!,"""The Mysterious Private Thompson"" is a first-rate, riveting book about a woman who ran away from home to avoid an arranged marriage and disguised herself as a man to make her way in the world. She first became a successful traveling book salesman and then, astoundingly, served as a Civil War soldier for two years. Not only is the story fascinating as to how someone could maintain a disguise so effectively for so long a period of time, but the story's historical context is so carefully researched and deftly conveyed that you are almost unaware that this is a history book as well as a human interest story. I learned more in this book about the Battles of Bull Run, the Peninsula Campaign, the Battle of Fredericksburg, plus Generals McClellan and Burnside, than I had in all my years of school. Laura Gansler is a brilliant, gifted writer and I highly recommend this book."
2,Its great while it works,I had a smilar situation as another reviewer - the washwer worked great for about 15-16 mos and this summer - brought it out and nothing. The motor kicks on when I plug it in and turn it on but as soon as I turn the water on the motor shuts off and the water comes through with normal pressure. I am not mechanically inclined - so I wouldn't even know what to look for to try to fix it :-( Maybe these washers just don't last.
3,"Beautiful photographs, but....","This book contains some wonderfully ""art-y"" photographs, but it's more about the photographer than about the District of Columbia. If you are already familiar with the capital, you will probably enjoy the photographs, but it's not the book for you if you want a sort of tourist-oriented collection of prominent landmarks and vistas. Instead, the photos tend to be close-ups of a tiny corner of a building or monument; unless you read the photographer's notes, you will often not be able to identify what you are looking at. That being said, some of the photos are rather beautiful - this is a book for people interested in photography, not in tourism or reference. For the latter folks, I recommend Robert Cameron's ""Above Washington"" although it needs to be updated."
4,Camping Time...,"Eric Bachmann is Bob Dylan with a good voice! I loved this album...I want to take Mr. Bachmann camping with me! As you listen to this album, you can't help but think of campfires and starry nights. My favorite kind of music is a man and his guitar...with talent. The talent here is above and beyond my excpectaions. It is a mellow and slightly sad album, but the music is haunting and it will stick with you for years. If you like Bob Dylan, you will fall in love with this artist. Enjoy!"
2,gets old fast,I bought this game because I loved Fantastic Four the movie. I wanted to wield the fire of the human torch and have the strenth of the thing. NOT WITH THIS GAME!!!! You bacically do the same thing every level and after the about the sixth level this gets extremely boring.
4,one of the better superhero games...,"okay it's not as good as marvel ultimate alliance, or justice league heroes. but it's a fun superhero game, a kind of mix between justice league heroes and x-men legends except using the fantastic four (the greatest team in comics). like the movie, this game was fashionably picked on but like the movie it is a lot better than what the critics said about it."
2,Mostly outdated,"This is a mostly outdated, but very detailed, book on faux finishes.I was looking for a modern book on creating crackle finishes and 'peeling' paint. This is NOT that book.It was detailed, but half the book was on other topics........ like interior design.What was written on actual painting was all on outdated techniques (who does faux marble anymore??!!).The only section I found interesting was a part on hillbilly-type woodgrain design.In any case...The book reads like a textbook.And the only useful bit of info I have used from this book is that you can use a hair (yes, from your head) to create little tiny grains. I took that tidbit of info and applied it to modern use in antiquing wood and paper (works great!)...... but now that I've told you about the hair, there's really no point in buying this book. I'm sure it was great in it's day, but that day has gone."
4,Wonderful compilation album,"All of Julie Andrews' ealier album are hard to find now, except for the Original cast recordings such as ""My Fair Lady"" and ""Camelot"". This one is consisted of these original cast album and the albums hard to find. You can hear the young, and fresh voice of Julie Andrews. My favorites are ""I feel pretty"" and ""How can I wait?"" I think this one is very recommentable."
4,Magnaflow,"My old cat had desentragrated, and this was an economical replacemet, do be aware though it is about 8"" long, so you'll likely need a shor piece of pipe to fill the hole from your old one."
4,Secret Agenda,"Nexus Ops is a very fun strategy/battle game for 2-4 players. It is quick to set up and get started and the rules are written well. I've played with friends and hosted this game at conventions. It is always a hit, and any player can turn a losing game into a winner in a single turn (which is always exciting). The price point on this game is consistent with non-mainstream games, but fluctuates as it is in-and-out of print from time to time. The components are decent quality, but the actual modular game board hexes are relatively small and could be a bit bigger and better overall. This is one of my favorite games and with a modular game board, the replayabilty is nearly endless. Good game to teach strategy and tactics."
4,A great strategy game for the whole family,Nexus ops is a game that has proven itself over and over again in our house and gaming group as beign a game that is easy for the whole group to get into and learn in a comfortable amnmount of time. If you are looking for a game that is a good step up from Risk and does not take years to play look no further. Nexus ops will full fill that niche you have been looking to fill. Great game.
2,not what I thought,There was some good reviews on this and I thought I would notice a difference but I havent. Its been over a week and my hairs a little softer but I also changed shampoo's so beware .. The price was high wont be buying again.
1,Not what I expected,"I purchased this product based on the reviews, but it is nothing that I expected. It has not helped or even condition my hair. I am disappointed. I believe this product is not worth the money, not worth it at all."
1,Not light or a cover-up,"I was really disappointed with this product. It's labeled ""light"" but it's the darkest light shade I've ever seen and sticks out like a sore thumb on my 'alabaster' skin. It's extremely heavy with yellow tones and does nothing to cover-up redness or acne. It actually makes me look as if a have jaundice."
4,great buy,I am pleased with the ease of loading the speed loaders and loading the revolver. I would recommed buying this product.
1,No Index? In a Cookbook?,"The recipes in this book are great. However, some demon possessed the author and he excluded an index! And the table of contents is too slim to deserve the title. No matter how good it is --and it is-- I am frustrated to have to thumb page by page to find that great banana bread recipe again. Buy the book but dis the author for shabby work!"
5,Education and Enjoyment,"I bought this book, because I desire a through knowledge of bears, their life, their existance. Reading this book has opened my my eyes to more than I ever thought there was to learn. I even bought a map so that I could see the areas he describes. If all books about grizzles and bears are this enjoyable, I have alot of reading to do. I now have a new found respect and admiration for the grizzly."
5,Sharing the Grief Response,"I have been active in grief work for years, but when my mother passed after a long journey with Alzheimers', I needed to walk this process again. This book helped me embrace emotions and questions I had not experienced before. I now keep extra copies in my library to share with others who have lost their moms and help them understand how this bond is like no other. Harold Ivan Smith's book helped make this journey easier for me."
5,GREAT MUSIC BY A GREAT COMPOSER,"IF THIS CD ONLY HAD ""WE HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD"", IT WOULD BE WORTH THE PRICE AND THEN SOME. I FIRST HEARD THIS ARRANGEMENT IN 1981 ON AN EASY LISTENING RADIO STATION IN CHICAGO AND FELL IN LOVE WITH IT. THERE ARE OTHER GOOD SONGS AS WELL ON THIS CD LIKE ""FUN CITY"", ""WEDNESDAY'S CHILD"", AND ""NEXT TIME""."
4,Very educational and insightful book,"This is a good book that talks about importance of nutritional supplements and their role in maintaining optimal health. I am in my early 30s and being young and also a health and exercise fanatic, I had always thought that eating a well-balanced diet was sufficient. Little did I know that 99% of the population does not get ALL the necessary nutrients that are required for your body to function at an optimal level. I found the section on the autoimmune system very interesting and something that I could relate to. This book has expanded my horizons and was very insightful.Another helpful book to read that will help you guide you through the maze of nutritional supplements that are available is ""Comparative Guide to Nutrition"" by Lyle Macwilliams. To my knowledge, it is the only book available that rates the products that out in the marketplace right now."
3,Regarding previous review,"To the reviewer who began with 'Look at a map...please!' there is a Columbus in Indiana, which is south of Indianapolis and thus makes perfect sense.As for the book itself, it was okay. I'm a psychologist and so like reading books with psychologists as characters. He does a decent job of describing a somewhat psychodynamic oriented therapist, but the story itself is not that compelling, and I predicted the ending halfway through. Myself, I prefer Kellerman's Alex Delaware novels."
3,"Good for academics , best for undergraduates","A good book , reviews almost all the basics and undamentals of microprocessors. A good introduction for any one who wants to start with the world of microprocessors even with todays revolutionary machines."
1,Don't waste the time,"This was, hands down, the WORST book I've ever read in my life. I read it once, hated it...decided maybe I missed the ""deeper meaning"", so I read it again...it was even worse the second time. It is an unorganized collection of ideas and thoughts that had so much potential, but decided to skip class and get high instead. I cannot say strongly enough not to buy this book. It was so bad I stopped donating money to literacy programs in order to save people from ever possibly reading it."
4,Nice and short,"In this nicely concise book (which can easily be read in one or two nights), the authors discuss the issue of step-parenting. Although we all have an intuitive sense that step parents are not the same as genetic parents, Daly and Wilson present more precise statistics, and provide an evolutionary explanation for why this might be the case. This book will go well with all the other evolutionary psychology books in your collection."
5,Troubled Hearts Find Happiness,"Elisabeth Fairchild's books are evocative of place and time and this one is no exception. One can see and feel the rain and mists, the rugged scenery of Cumbria, and how this fits the state of mind of the main characters. Alexander Shelbourne, the ex-officer who is known as ""Captain Cupid"", has come home sick at heart over the killing he had to do, traveling with two of his friends. He meets Penny Foster, the young woman looked upon by the townspeople as fallen from grace because of family secrets, the foremost being the little girl in her care. I was enthralled and engrossed in this book as I read, felt all the pain of the trio of troubled souls, and sighed with satisfaction at the outcome."
3,Mediocre...,"This CD really isn't worth the $49 that it's advertised. I got it here in Japan, paid $26, and still felt cheated. The uplifting style just doesn't sound right here, it almost sounds forced. Ferry can't live down the days when he did Exhale, Carte Blanche, or even Out of the Blue anymore. He's doing something even more drastic to his sound with recent releases like Punk, and Rock Your Body Rock. Almost sounds like Darude...poor guy, I'd rather have my music progress, rather than regress.If you're a die-hard Ferry fan, or just can't get enough of that JP-8080 sound, you'll probably enjoy this. Personally, as a Prog fan, I'm almost offended by this album."
2,Flashy but flawed,"Nicely presented, but heavily reliant on French sources. Even then, injudiciously choosen to the point that Col. Elting disavows the use of Thiebalt in the forward. Completely at sea when discussing Allies, it is based on secondary sources missing some important ones, and often presenting footnotes that are irrelevant, anachronistic, or flatly contradictory to the text they preport to support. Egregious errors in the technical information. Attack on Chandler distasteful, attack on Griffith completely incoherent as Griffith essentially agrees about Soult!"
5,A riveting drama with spellbinding action from beginning to end,"A joint DEA-Panamanian operation collapses under the weight of internal betrayal and culminates in a fiasco of human devastation. From the decimation of Team Bravo, a U.S. drug interdiction team under the leadership of Captain Alexander Scot Richter, to the elimination of an entire Colombian village, Ignoble is a riveting drama with spellbinding action from beginning to end. The first of a planned trilogy, Ignoble demonstrates and documents Sturmen Kreig's storytelling skills and keen attention to detail and background for his characters, his story, and their settings. Ignoble is highly recommended reading that will leave action/adventure fans looking eagerly forward to the next installment of ""The Dark Ages"" trilogy."
4,Have to disagree with the others here!,"This album has been castigated far too long. It may not be her best album, and neither is it her worst. Although, the sound may have sounded more generic than her new-wavey previous albums. So here are the tracks that make this album worthwhile:1. I Drove All Night2. Like A Cat - FYI its not a filler. Its Fun and Cute as in her SSU album!3. A Night to Remember4. Unconditional Love5. Dancing With A Stranger - this is where her 90's sound started. So for those who hate this track, might as well hate her entire album post ANTR. Besides, the vocals are nicely delivered.6. I Dont Want To Be Your Friend - filled with angst. Almost doesn't sound like her.The only difference this album has compared to her previous killer albums was that it doesn't sound Fun anymore. Suffice to say that she has changed direction, and that's a rap."
4,Dancing whit Cyndi,"This CD came out in the late 80, but I just bought it 3 years ago. Ever since i have bought this album I have listen to it at least once everyday. The songs U should especially listen to is the songs: The night - love song I Drove All Night, My First Night Whitout You, Like A Cat, A Night To Remember, Dancing Whit A Stranger. This Album is good, but if U really Like Cyndi so buy this album Hat Full Of Stars, at this reckord U can really hear Cyndi's voice when it's best, and byu Time After Time best of Cyndi Lauper, at this album is the really rare song The Goonies 'R'Good Enough, this women will suprise U Time After Time."
4,Cyndi's Last 80s CD...,"In the liner notes, Cyndie Lauper stated that this was her best album ever. Not the case, as it is no where near as intelligent or catchy as ""She's So Unusual"" or ""True Colors"". It is however, a great pop album. The best track on here is unquestionably the single ""I drove All Night"". Everything else seems to be pop, ""Like a Cat"" and ""Primitive"", to catchy yet hollow, ""My First Night Without You"" to ""Insecurious"". The title track itself is nice, and as with the before mentioned single, she is going into a new vocal style on ""A Night To Remember"". It really is a good CD, it's just a little forgettable."
1,"HATSHEPSUT, HIS MAJESTY, HERSELF","ONLY PAINTINGS, NOT THE REAL THING..., POOR CONTENT, MAYBE FOR A CHILD..., NEVER FOR AN ADULT..., I BOUGHT OTHERS THAT WERE JUST GREAT..."
5,Magick? Serious? Interested,"Amonst a ton of drivel published on the subject, these two bythe one-time Sect'y to A. Crowley are a must for the serious or even seni-serious inquirer into a (the?) basis for an understandingon the underpiunnings of magic(k)"
1,Out Dated,"Should be taken out of print! Welcome to the digital age. I would not recommend to anyone, including a beginner."
2,Too thick,"This pad was too thick to allow the stroller straps to fasten. I have a double jogging stroller, and was going to use this for my 3 month old, and I couldn't even loosen the straps enough to strap him in. So, beware of the thickness of this pad."
4,great sidemen as well,"The 1st few tracks are live in a studio it seems. But as well as great trombone - like all the sidemen are very special and sound that way too. Nat Adderley, Tommy Flanagan shines thru here and there with terrific lines and accompaniment, Max Roach has a burning solo, also Victor Feldman and others."
4,Ralph S. Mouse,"I think The Mouse and the Motorcycle is better than Ralph S. Mouse because The Mouse and the Motorcycle is more easier to read. There are hard words in Ralph S. Mouse.The book is about a boy named Ryan and a mouse named Ralph. Ralph has to run through this maze a lot to prove that he is smart. There are a lot of different people in Ralph S. Mouse. The book has a lot of interesting stuff in it Like that Ralph can drive a sports car.I think Ralph S. Mouse Is an interesting book, and if you read Ralph S. Mouse you would enjoy the book. I think you would enjoy it because The people in the book have a lot of personality. Both of the books have Ralph in the book and something he can drive."
1,Amatuerish in layout and copy. Save your money!,"Beading how-to books, in the past, have been difficult to locate and recent interest in beadwork and the various techniques have inspired many newcomers to this creative field. Although this booklet has an inviting cover it is poorly constructed in layout, copy and design. Schematics are poorly drawn pen/ink drawings with hand lettering which make reading the copy difficult. I would not recommend this to a beginner as it will frustrate the new beader and the booklet is too rudimentary in format for an intermediate or skilled beader. There are numerous beginner or guide to beading books available now. Skip this one altogether."
2,The Magical Beaded Medicine Bag Book,"The description given excited me at the prospect of new patterns for beaded bags. Upon receiving the book and examining it, I was terribly disappointed at the content. The pictures and drawings were crudely done. For me, some of the work was actually ugly. I feel my money was wasted in purchasing this book."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!,Looks as if a child designed the book. go to the library FIRST! once you do you will not want to buy it. It has just a few pages to the entire book and very grade-school projects. I have many bead books and I would recommend ANY of them over this one.
2,Flimsy,"This spoon is very light and flimsy, regular steel not stainless. I would opt for a thicker one of stainless."
4,rugged enough for camping,"these Stearns sunshowers are likely the best in the industry!the hose and shower valve are tuff, and hold up better than other models.Never had a problem with bag leaks after years of use.don't forget to flush shower bag with diluted bleach solution for optimumcleanliness.I use(2)4gal bags for my week-end car/RV camping.use a snap-hook and longer rope for hanging bag(not included).""its a must have item for campers and RV'ers.""thanks Stearns!!!"
1,Casio Keyboard Quality,"The reviews I read of this show convinced me to buy the cd. Don't listen to them! The quality of the recording is horrible, especially the ""orchestra"". Since when does one keyboard classify as an orchestra. And the ""witty, charming"" lyrics are at best a chessey attempt at being clever. Please save your money. Thanks amazon for recommending this terrible cd to me. Glad I could pad your pockets some more."
5,LOVE IT,my son and I are putting it together we love it. looking forward to more to build. to bad you can only build one per book
1,Who knew that lying on your taxes was ok with TaxCut?,"First of all, even with the help of the tech support people I could not get the help system to install or function. My job is computer consulting and systems builds and it just didn't happen. On top of that I (on the recommendation of the TaxCut support team) had to put down that I had $1 in land ownership, even though I have none. The reason is that one field had to be greater than another, they couldn't both be 0. So I had to lie and say I had $1 in land so the software would submit my taxes.I was frustrated with TurboTax, but now it seems like the best software in the world, I will never, ever, try TaxCut again even if it is given to me for free."
1,Unusable,"This program reported an error with my choice of charity, downloaded update (none available), repeated error - download. I never was able to file my return."
2,Disappointing and Repetitive,"I own just about all of the Bellydance Superstars productions and I have to say, this one is my least favorite of them ALL. The production quality is very low. The picture is blurry and too distant. I spent half the time feeling as if I was seated in the back row watching a small production. The performances themselves felt repetitive and old. I recommend purchasing Bellydance Superstars: Live from Paris at the Folies Bergere instead which features a taste of many styles and is a wonderful production!"
2,Not quite what I expected,I was happy to come across this title with hopes that this was a book I could really learn from. Yet as with many other similar books the information presented in the CAD drawings are minimal and of little substance.It is surely a waste of money to purchase the CD.Did people forget how to actually detail buildings when they stopped drawing by hand?
1,MikeW,"I'm looking for an Oxygen sensor for 2001 Mitsubishi Montero, Bank-2 Sensor-2 (exhaust side for cylinders 2-4-6, post cat)and Denso says Cat #23522, NGK say 234-4633. So why does the Amazon part have a Denso name with a NGK part# ?"
5,The perfect book for shadowboxing,"I have this boxing manual for more than a year now. It's perfect if you tend to shadowbox to work your boxing skills. You get a good workout yet boxing correctly in its format. Perfect manual for novice to advanced boxer. It also goes well with Hatmaker's other manual on Savage Strikes, more of freestyle, NHB fighting. I read this boxing manual numerous times when I have time available and tend to shadowbox as a workout to work on my boxing form and getting my cardio that way. So if you have some boxing skills, whether you've been taught by your dad or mom in some cases or at a boxing gym this book is perfect to go along with your skill to improve boxing. Sweet science at its best."
4,This is the pefect guide to library fund-raising,"The author takes readers on a step-by-step tour of the often tortuous twists in non-profit fund-raising. Organizing Friends Groups not only spells out the difficulties, but concluding chapters provide readers with a blueprint for success."
1,Not Very Useful,"I guess this book is useful if you want to know such insightful things as it gets hot in the summer in Washington DC and kids are not in school, or, that it gets very cold in the winter (imagine that). Other gems include that you can take a cab from the airport to your hotel, and to wear comfortable shoes if you plan to do a lot of walking. I picked this up before a trip to the nation's capitol, and was underwhelmed with the information. Luckily one of my buddies had a different much more comprehensive guide to the Washington DC, so we opted to use that."
1,Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,"Such copycats.The Bratz Head Gamez dolls are exsatcly the same as the My Scene Swappin' Styles,except the My Scene Dolls are sooooooooooooo much better.The heads actually fit and stay put(unlike on the Bratz)and the My Scene dolls come in more editions.If you want to buy a doll that changes heads,don't buy the Bratz Heads Gamez,buy the My Scene Swappin' Styles."
3,Chain Link Problems,"Easy to put together, but neeeds 2 sets of hands. Chain link is of a very light gauge and my roll was tangled. This made the simple job of attaching the chain link a very long job. However, it is still a good buy for the price."
1,"Waste of time, cheap fabric","The frame went up fast and easy but is not real strong. The fabric came all tangled up, The chain link fabric was so cheap gauge the tangled mess could not be untangled, the end loops were hooked into each other, some of the wires were even unwound and the fence was different length in PLACES DUE TO THESE BEING UNWOUND . This item was returned for this reason of not being able to get the fabric untangled. Do not waste your time or money on this product. Go to a hard ware store and build you a good dog kennel fence."
2,Flimsy,"I've had to repair this kennel several times. The chain link isn't heavy gauge, and my 50 lb dog is able to pounce on it, create a hole, and exit her kennel."
1,DIY??? REALLY???,THIS PRODUCT CAME WITH VERY UNCLEAR INSTRUCTIONS!!! ALSO IT IS NOT DIY... IT TOOK FOUR OF US TO ASSEMBLE IT AND THE PARTS DONT FIT WELL AT ALL!!! I ALSO DIDNT REALIZE THAT I WOULD HAVE TO ASSEMBLE THE MESSY TANGLED CHAINLINK MYSELF!!! NOT SURE IT WILL EVEN BE STURDY ENOUGH TO KEEP OUR LARGE DOG IN:( REALLY SUCKS!!!!
4,Nice chain and lock!,"Great Price, will work nicely. Using for a motorcycle to go between the wheel spokes. If using for a bicycle you may want to get a longer chain."
3,cute bike chain,"It is a cute bike chain, but it is too short chain bike in a lot of things ( 2 feet and half or 32 inch). I can only chain my bike in two things with it that is street parking sign pole or bike parking area.I had better chain than this, and it was broken , and I was shocked.I'm happy with it because it Intimidation amateur thief, so they move on to an easier bike."
4,Anton Bruckner Symphony #6,While not the most exciting romantic symphony nor Bruckner's ultimate; this is a workman like solid performance of a not quite symphonic standard. There are moments of finely drawn contrasts and rich sonorities.
1,Broke before we could even use it,"If you are buying a 4/4 size, I recommend spending the extra $10 to get a nicer one. This one broke before we could even put it on the violin."
2,Unwatchable,"This is a great concert, but as others have said, the frenetic camera work and syncing problems make it virtually unwatchable. It makes me almost nauseous to watch something where the camera jumps around so often, and there's really no point bearing the irritation if, when you actually get to see someone play something, it's not even in sync with the audio.Considering you can get this whole set on the excellent ""Exposures: In Retrospect and Denial"" compilation, there's really no reason to have the DVD version unless you're a hardcore fan and love having concert DVDs."
4,Works fine,"Using it with Comcast cable modem and two computers about 500 feet and 1 floor apart. Works quite reliably, it auto detects the IP and does eveything transparently. My only gripe is D-Link's support seems to be run by underqualified technicians that just give you the run around. Good thing it works fine already, so it's not much of an issue to me."
1,"no range, no wep","I am very disappointed in this product, the range is terrible, it doesn't come close to what it claims, I have it in my family room and get poor signal in some places in my kitchen (the adjoining room).Also, I tried to configure wep, it doesn't work, I called tech support and they couldnt get it to work either. Their suggestion, don't use wep.Finally, even when it is working and not using wep and in the same room since the range is so lousy, it seems to freak out my router every once in a while for no apparent reason, the device loosed connectivity and I cant get anywhere, have to reboot :)bottom line, don't buy this..."
3,Size doesn't match,Very nice shoes but they were way too small and too narrow. Need to purchase a full size larger and extra wide.
4,sebago shoes,shoes are a bit narrow for me did not realise the cut of the shoe but overall it is good the rubber sole makes walking in the shoes very comfortable
3,I'm a loafer (lover). Be a loafer,"The only criticism I could tell about this shoes is that in the first few days of wearing it, there was some discomfort but as I used it more often, I became comfortable with it."
1,"Mobilizing SAP: Business Processes, ROI and Best Practices","The book is a very high level overview of the SAP mobile infrastructure and does not give you any idea of how SAP mobile Business really works, what is the technlogy behind or what is the SAP strategy for the future. The book is very poor (just 200 pages) and it looks like just a cut and paste from material found in the SAP site with any added value or explanation that helps the reader to understand. In addition the text is too big and paper is very poor and does not justify the price.Marco Moschella+15 years in the SAP business."
4,Works great with MAC,"I purchased this to work with my iBook G4, which does not have a SuperDrive. I wanted to make DVDs with iDVD and this worked fine. I did need to find a patch online to get iDVD to recognize the drive, but other than that, once it stated working, it gave me the results that I wanted. It also was quick when backing up my data files.Comes with Toast Lite - which can also be used to burn DVD movies. It isn't ""light"" weight or noisy which is nice. And once you unplug the USB cable, it shuts itself off.NOTE: IF YOU ARE BUYING THIS TO USE IDVD, YOU NEED IDVD VERSION 5 (which comes with iLife 05), Older versions of this program will not recognize or burn to this drive."
5,Airsoft review,My son is really enjoying using this rifle. It is light weight and shoots really well. It has a great strap making easy to travel around with. It comes with an amazing amount of BB's.
2,Broken and missing pieces,"The gun arrived with a spring out of the gun...laying in the packaging, a broken scope and a missing battery. Very disappointed. My son was excited for this as his birthday present and was upset at the condition it was in when he opened the box. We will be sending this back but waiting for a pre-paid return shipping label....we are hoping to get."
2,Book fell apart,"Within one hour of beginning a reading of this paperback book...""Lieutenant Gatewood""...the binding came unglued and the pages separated...very shoddy work by Bison Books as ordered through Amazon. Totally detracts from the ownership of this rare and valued history by an almost forgotten soldierwhere is the submit button?"
4,went a bit to far,Course this was what the 70's so I guess it wasn't a bad movie all around I like the first one the best and the second one too. this one was kinda boring and dragged out the congress scene way to long.
5,Good stuff,My dogs lOve these things. I have two different toys they go in and whenever they see me picking them up they follow me to the kitchen and wait fir me to fill them with he treats then immediately start rolling the toys around to get at them.
3,Dog wasn't too impressed.,"I'm sure some dogs find these treats irresistible. My dog kind of looked at the ""treats"" as regular dog food. She isn't impressed and is in no hurry to chow down. They are good for filling a treat ball though if you don't want it empty in minutes."
5,Great product,"Use these treats to reward your puppies for sitting, dropping, etc. They help train your puppy."
2,Where's the color?,I wanted so much for my dog to like these treats. She turned her nose immediately. It looked like years old brown dried dog food all crumbled up opposed to the nice vibrant mixed colors one you see in the picture. The only thing positive is the size of the treats that can go in the Twist toy.
5,Most of us know a Stanley Easter. Be reminded ...........,I saw Donald Davis tell this story live and have never forgotten the impact that it had on me. The story finds familiar links to the most private parts of my past that I think many of us secretly share. I highly recommend this one.
4,Good replacement or spare charger,Fair quality product. Reasonable charging time. TEsted it on a PSP1000 and PSP3000. Worked almost as great as the original chargers.
5,Excellent Book,"I loved this book! It was a great beginning course in color, design, balance and how to make it ""look"" right. I highly recommend this book"
1,why,1.His shirt looks way to small.2.His shorts look silly3.the black stuff better come off4.WHAT WAS YOU THINKING MGA
4,Geat Price on these Cleats!,"I bought these for my son who is a soccer-player. He loves them and feels ""cool"" in them- great price and great quality."
2,Review - Teen Titans,I thought it was going to be a better game... I really had better expectations... it is even kind of bored.Excellent customer service and timing... but the game itself it is not very good.Adrian
4,overview,"Book covers a broad range of subjects in an attempt to put an overview on relationship between the various parts previewed by the table of contents. This it does very well. This book is good for someone who has just read about nnets or fuzzy in Vogue or Cosmopolitan and wants a little deeper info. However, it does little to explore, as an example the exact relationship between say an adaptive neural net and non-adaptive. Or why the cart-pole problem cannotbe stabilzed past 36 degrees with any system. The math contained can be transported to MathCad with some difficulty depending on the reader's ability. Matlab provides toolbox for both fuzzy and nnets, including all the topics covered in this book. In addition Segueno type linear output fuzzies are discussed and incorporated in their Simulink system."
4,Some treats from the past.,"If you like really short SF stories then you should read this book. It contains a lot of them and they are good. They are also short. The book packs fifty stories plus introductions etc into less than 300 pages.The collection was first issued in the early sixties and the stories themselves come from the forties and fifties. SF is a rapidly changing medium and, with an average age of half a century, many of these stories now show their age. But that does not really detract from their quality. After all, this collection features the greatest SF talents of the era.If forced to pick a favourite from the collection, I'd choose ""The Available Data on the Worp Reaction"" by Lion Miller but there are so many good tales in here that naming one alone is an injustice to the others."
1,It really is that bad.,"I'm writing this review to warn against wasting your time on this video. It is basically a conspiracy theory type movie, but it lacks any interesting story, dialogue, or concept. It's just a deadly virus, that's it. Yes, the government is experimenting on its people for a biological weapon they want to use. You now know as much about the movie as anyone who has seen the picture. And man, is it slow. It crawls along, and just when you think maybe it might start get interesting, it doesn't. You think, ""surely there is going to be some twist to this and it will get better."" Trust me, it wont, right up until the end."
1,Kunal Kohli has yet to make a decent movie,"I have yet to watch a Kunal Kohli movie I've liked, and yes, that includes his superhit Fanaa. For me, the problem with Kohli's films is his poor understanding of pacing and timing. Scenes and dialogues go on forever. Perhaps other audience members might find that acceptable, but I have better things to do with my time than staring at my watch every two minutes.Thoda Pyaar... is probably one of Kohli's worst culprits too. Forget upbeat and crispy, this tale had my kids bored to tears and they gave up on it after 30 minutes. Walked straight out of the room and did not return until it was over. I'm glad they abandoned it though, because the Lazy Lamhe music video was shamefully embarassing and very age inappropriate for little kids.Rani and Saif sleep-walk through the movie."
3,beautiful but hot,Very beautiful but small and very hot. When water has boiled it is actually dangerous to the touch. The handle gets very hot and moves unsafely when handled. Definitely nothing for households with children. It is rather a show piece.
3,"Dogs good, people bad",For animal lovers there are some warm fuzzy areas in this book. I was disappointed in the overall flow of the story as it felt disjointed. The author was a bit condescending and had points in the book that made me feel inadequate to have a pet as a family member.
2,bad,"this movie is probaly one of the weakest films in the last five years. the acting is so cheezy and stupid i almost walked out in the middle of the film. the sound was good but the story, acting, quality, entertainment was wack. only those stupid rednecks who are winning motorcross nationals or sections or whatever they do are going to like this movie. o and i forgot the picture is horrible. if you needed anything to make a movie about motorcross you need good picture. i would even admit it would be kinda cool if a motorcycle flew past me. so u have to have good picture so it would look like that. the picure was terrible. worst picure ive seen in i dont know how many years.BUT of all the negatives there is a positive.KIDS WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE. this is the miami reviewer.PEACE."
4,As Described,"Works well - as described - good build quality. The wire did come undone once, but I was able to reattach it *relatively* quickly without too much issue."
1,Absolute nonsense,"After reading this book I went on to study Archaeology and History.Looking back on it now, I can honestly say the book is full of absolute nonsense and Michell completly ignores over 100 years work by some of the greatest academics, archaeologists and historians. The book is packed full of New Age 'Hippy-Dippy' rubbish with no evidence whatsoever to back some it's outragous claims.Avoid, find yourself a proper academic book to read instead."
4,Corona Clipper 1-Inch Capacity Bypass Pruner,"The Corona Clipper 1-Inch Capacity Bypass Pruner is a good tool but I find it is still difficult cutting dead branches and branches in the 1"" range. I was looking for a hand clipper that has a lot of leverage (ratcheting) rather than using my large clipper for those more difficult branches."
2,Fenwick Houses,"The book was good, but was much too dragged out in the beginning. I didn't find it as good as about a dozen or so other Catherine Cookson books which I have read lately, including ""The Black Velvet Gown"", ""A Dinner of Herbs"", ""The Cultured Handmaiden"", ""The Whip"". The ending was very good."
2,Sharp digital camcorder,"The first time I ordered it, it was defective and a pain to try and return, then the replacement took too long."
1,Oops Wrong DV camera.,I know a lot of people have got into trouble by now.Sharp the name does not match for this product. There isno sharpness in the picture quality.Recording is great but playback sucks. I tried to record it into a VHS after 10 min I started seeding two to three thick black lines.I personally feel spend another 150-200 more and buy a good product.
4,Good value starter DV camcorder,"I returned this camcorder in favor of a more compact model (Canon Elura 2mc).With that said, (this) is a great deal for a DV camcorder. If you are in the market for one of the Sony Digital-8's (e.g. TRV330) this is a great alternative. It is slightly smaller than the Sony's (and more ergonomic). If you are looking at ZR-10/ZR-20 or smaller. Forget this one as it is very much larger.I would choose the WD-255U over the WD-450U...the greatest difference that I found was that the 450U comes with an 8MB memory card (which are dirt cheap these days). The 255U comes with a card slot, just no card. The 255U also has ""cat-eye"", although it doesn't show up in the specs.Unless Amazon comes back with the (...) ZR-10 special, this is the way to go for a low cost DV camcorder."
4,Great First Time Camera,"If you never owned a camcorder before and you don't have a lot of money to spend, then I highly recommend this camera. It took me about a day of trial and error to learn all the features.First off the digital stills that the camera takes is not that bad. I bought a 32 meg SmartMedia card, and on the best resolution setting, I can get around 200+ pictures on the card. The pictures at the best setting can range from 90-120K. The clarity isn't perfect, but if you keep a steady hand and use good lighting the pictures are tolerable.As for the video: The picture looks just fine too me. The 16x by 9x letterbox is nice if you own or plan to buy a widescreen television soon. The sound is superb. I was very impressed with the sound from the camera.You can't beat this price. Don't let the other reviews fool you. This is a great first camcorder.NOTE: This camera has S-Video output, but no cable is included. It also has the Cat Eyes feature. I don't know if I would ever use it."
4,Great Camera for the price. Cna't beat it,"I bought this item not sure if it would be good, but thought that the price was great...I don't think you'll find a better camcorder for even several hundred dollars more.I had a Sony Camcorder I bought about 5 years ago and had nothing but constant trouble with it. I'll never buy another Sony product.This sharp has lots of great features for the price. I do find that it is slightly uncomfortable to hold and the menu system takes a little getting used to, but the picture quality and other digital features are top notch (compared to my old 8mm). The smart card feature for taking still photos is awesome. A digital still camera and a digital camcorder for (...)...unbelivable.For general purpose use for family holidays and vacations...It's perfect. You won't be using this camera for making hollywood movies, but hey, it wasn't (expensive) either."
3,Nice features per dollar,"If you want a video camera for a low price, this one has lots of nice features per dollar. Certainly the only one worth buying in the Sharp line (255-450-650U). The Viewscreen and remote are good. The Zoom is terrific, and the CatsEye feature is pretty amazing in dusk lighting, but the daylight picture quality is only comparable to 8mm in my estimation and 12 years experience with two previous Canon 8mm camcorders. I expected better, but even with 460k pixels it is grainy, and only marginally better than my old Canon 8mm cameras with 270k pixels. The Still capture is again very grainy, and painfully slow browsing thru the thumbnails (now shopping for a still camera). I hope the camera is more durable than indicated by some other reviewers.All in all - it is a good cheap replacement for my broken Canon 8mm, but it is not a step up in video quality that a more expensive Canon ZR30 might be. 4~5 stars for value, but 2~3 stars for ""digital"" quality."
1,HORRIBLE PICTURE QUALITY!!!,"I bought this camcorder hoping it would be a dramatic difference over my old Panasonic vhs-c. Boy was I wrong. In fact it looked worse! I tried everything from changing the settings to loading different tapes. I've read that other brands have excellent outside shots. Taping my sons soccer game on a bright sunny day was also a huge disappointment, it was grainy and we had a hard time recognizing him. My wife who is not picky complained about how bad the picture degraded just when using the optical zoom and I heartily agreed with her. It had nice features but it did not offset our feelings about the picture quality. Maybe theres a bigger reason for the current $... rebate."
1,eats tapes; breaks,"I get the ""eject the cassette"" message as well, and Sharp is EXTREMELY unhelpful. I'd say it works without eating tape only about 50% of the time. Pathetic. Absolutely unacceptable.I won't buy other Sharp products in the future either."
4,Better than I expected!,"I purchased this camcorder with the intention of using it on my Macintosh computer. I was very surprised at how easy it was to transfer my video on to VHS tapes and on to my computer to be edited and saved. I was also pleased to learn that I could save my video as a Quicktime movie so that I could give copies to friends and family. I have not played with the still photo aspect yet, but even without that feature I think this camcorder is a great buy. This is my first camcorder and I am very pleased with it. I highly reccomend it."
1,Heads dirty fast,"The camcorder heads become dirty very quickly upon viewing a recorded tape and need to be cleaned. Once cleaned, they dirty after about 20 minutes of viewing a recorded tape. The other features are fine, but what good are they with dirty heads?"
1,I would NOT recommend it.,"Like most other people, the price attracted me to this item. It was the cheapest mini DV camcorder with the features that I wanted. I used it to video tape my sons first Christmas and was extremely disappointed when I replayed the footage. The picture was no viewable. It was so bad that even the sound was affected. I returned it for a new one and no better. I am done with this product."
1,"Amazon Good, Camera Awful","We have tried three of these cameras, having to return each of them. Each did an adequate job recording, the problem is with the playback. Out of the three we tried, each played back a very distorted picture with no sound. Amazon customer service was excellent in each case and took care of us - its just that the camera is really a piece of junk. Save your time and money and look for another brand!"
1,El Cheapo & poor quality,"This camcorder eats up tape. When it doesn't eatup the tape, it leaves some sort of imprint/smudging on the tape that renders it useless.The resolution in photo mode is okay if the photo was taken in good light.Also, Sharp has extremely limited Factory authorized service Centers. I am in Virginia & the nearest one is 300 miles away!!"
1,Don't do it--Buyers Beware!!!!,"I am very disappointed in the performance of this camera. Buyers BEWARE!! After recording only two dv tapes in six months documenting my newborn son's first months at home, I decided to transfer the footage to VHS. Upon rewinding the tapes, an error message of Eject the tape flashed upon the screen. I ejected this tape and tried the other one. Again this message flashed across the screen. Upon further inspection, I found that the camcorder had mangled both of these tapes--mind you Panasonic tapes--. Now, I am stuck with a piece of junk and ruined tapes of my child's first months of life. I can honestly say that I will not be buying any other Sharp products..."
1,Bad deal,"I used the camera for about a year when the screen scrambling problem arrived. It's the same problem alluded to by many others. Repair facility charges $256. I bought this product because I wanted a digital camcorder for not much money - to get my feet wet. Luckily, I was able to get some footage before it croaked. I would not buy this product or any other camcorder from Sharp. It's not worth it."
2,Not all I hoped for...,"Wanted to get a camcorder for my wife for Xmas so we could tape video of our new baby. Ordered this digital camcorder to tape those videos and to take digital pictures. (Already own the HP 315, and was hoping to use the camecorder as aa all in one package.)The video's came out fine. But the pictures themselves were a big let down. The pictures print off grainy and blurry.I do NOT recommend this camecorder if you plan to also use the digital camera functions.I've just sent the whole package back for a refund. I'll just go with a cheaper camecorder, and stick with my HP camera for stills."
1,You Get What You Pay For!!! But Amazon Bailed Me Out!!!,"My experience was not different than the other bad ones. The camera just died on me - taking important scenes while on a carriage ride in Central Park. But I didn't know that it died - it appeared to be taking the pictures.Yes it works great with IMOVIE and yes the features are amazing for the money - but I just got my replacement, yes I'm trying another, but it's already having the same problems.Amazon was awesome when I returned the first one and I guarantee you that I will do lots more business with them just by the great treatment. I just have to find one I can afford....hhhhmmm how about that PanasonicThanks Amazon and close but no cigar for Sharp"
1,Sharp needs more product validation,"Worked great, I was very happy for about 30 minutes recording time. After this, started getting progressively worse problems with pixelization during playback. At the price I hate to return it but will need to, it is totally unacceptable. Too bad, it was acceptable before (although not the sturdiest unit in the world). Sharp needs to work on their product validation -- obviously there is either a design or a manufacturing problem with the VL-WD255U based upon my and other people's similar complaints."
4,"Quick shipment, nothing fancy","Clock arrived soon after ordered. Minimal packaging; clock is smaller than a normal wall clock. Nothing fancy, but fit the bill for the Christmas gift request."
4,Great pro printer,"Ink is pricy but there are discount out there that helps, thanks.regards. Gordon/ numen1It is big but does a great job"
1,Wrong DVD,"I also received the wrong DVD. It's labeled as the Dulcimer DVD but when I play it I get instructions on how to play the base. It is unfortunate that I did not check it soon enough after purchase to get a refund...so maybe I should buy a base? :). If you order this, make sure to check the DVD right away."
5,This Stuff Will Kill Ya well you decide,"Late 80's punk done with a snotty pop edge that the 80's were great for. This disc has their way out of print first 7"" and the hard to find LP Love Honor and Obey, the xmas single with an awesome original Bob Kringle and a ripping cover of Father Christmas, couple more 7""ers, comp tracks include What Will The Neighbors Think from the Big One/City of LA Power Comp (get this too if you ain't got it, tons of punk) and 53rd and 3rd from Gabba Gabba Hey - Ramones Tribute. A total of 24 tracks. oh yeah with great female vocals that know how to sing and sometimes scream..."
3,a good movie but not very appealing,The movie is good.Sunil Dutt gives a good performance in the role. Ashok Kumar gives a gr8 performance in the role of a husband who is being cheated by his wife.Mala Sinha gives a gr8 performance in the role of an unfaithful wife who subsequently understands her mistake.Shashikala gives an awesome performance in the role of a blackmailer and the role even won her an award.On the whole the movie is Okk but cannot be given 10 because of some depressing moments and miscast.
4,Agility Ball,Works well. Just as advertised. It's a ball with spikes so it does not bounce in a predictable manner.
4,Color choice would have been nice.,"I've used these before in other homes we lived in. If you have a wall with multiple switches next together, that's when they come in handy! Especially for guests,if they're looking for a hall light, or a fan light, it's labeled! I only wish they weren't such a brassy color. But it's an easy fix, a little rub-n-buff and you're good to go!"
1,Read all the reviews...,"The tire on our wheelbarrow has been flat for what seems like forever. My husband and I didn't want to spend a lot of money for a new pump (our last expensive pump bit the dust too quickly) so I happened upon this little beauty. Only problem is I didn't read all 3 pages of reviews! If I had, I would have seen the ones that warn ""it doesn't inflate bicycle tires"" and I might have given this purchase a second thought. Instead, I went by the review that said ""It inflates everything--tires, balls, pools... anything you need inflated!"" and bought it. It inflated my daughter's kickball just fine, but it's utterly useless for my wheelbarrow wheel, which is the only reason I bought it in the first place! BIG disappointment, but lesson learned: READ ALL THE REVIEWS."
4,pumps up great!,We got the pump for use with a kayak and it works very well and we can get out on the water within 10 minutes. I really like it versatility for the deflate it is great.
4,Worked Well,"I don't know why Amazon classified this hand pump as a toy, so the ratings don't make any sense. It's not educational or fun! But it did a great job of pumping up our inflatable ring pool much more quickly than the foot pump our neighbors use. I was pleased that it came with a pin to inflate basketballs, soccer balls, etc., and with attachments allowing you to inflate other items."
5,Powerful mantra,Beautiful cd for anyone who recognizes the true power of this mantra and wants to chant it 108 times. Highly recommended.
5,persian review,"For persian visitors, there is a persian review that has been published in Mehr weekly too, in my blog : www.yousefi.persianblog.com"
5,As superb as anything Michener ever wrote.,"And I told Dorothy that. It is regrettable that she did not carry on the story; just as with a Michener novel, often when you get to the last page you want there to exist three more volumes. Dorothy spent some time in Hiroshima teaching at an all-girls school so her settings were authentic and the people were all ""real."" Used copies at $0.88? Buy several for friends. they'll thank you."
2,WAAAY BELOW AVERAGE GBA RACER,"DISNEYS LASTEST RACER FEATURING HERBIE THE STOCK CAR IS AVERAGE AT THE BEST OF TIMES. THE GAME IS OK IF ON AN WAAAY TOO EASY LEVEL WITH NO LONG TERM CHALLENGE. HERBIE LOOKS OUT OF SCALE WITH THE ROAD BY A MILE, THE HIGHWAY LANES ARE 3X HERBIES WIDTH.HERBIE FULLY LOADED IS FOR HERIBE FANS ONLY."
2,Could have been a great movie,"I waited in angst to see this movie when it came out on HBO. I love the Rat Pack and couldn't wait to hear the music. I thought the cast was excellent. The problem was the music for Sinatra, wasn't Sinatra singing.The result obviously for a fan is pure dissapointment to say the least. Maybe people who don't realize this will like the film and rate it 5 stars. Like I said... could have been a great movie, it just wasn't.You can't blame the actors. Who are great! Who wouldn't want to have played these parts?"
4,Ain't that a kick in the head...,"The Rat Pack, while somewhat constrained in a cinematic way, is nonetheless worth seeing. Don Cheadle is great as Sammy Davis Jr. Just watching his ""imaginary"" dance sequence of ""I've Got You Under My skin"" while watching an angry racist an anti-semitic mob gather outside his hotel, is worth the price of the DVD.Interestingly enough, the HBO production takes dead aim (poor word choice I realize) at the cold hearted Kennedy clan begging the question who was most disloyal and ultimately dishonest-- the Mafia in fixing the election or the Kennedys is their arrogant pursuit of power.Ray Liotta is a powerful Sinatra.I'd be remiss if I did not mention Joe Montegna's turn as Dean Martin; sober, sad and wise."
4,Fun bit of fluff,"This isn't a deep series for the most part. Though it does have it moments, it is usually episodic, often silly, and contains characters we are all probably familiar with. The story takes place in a country trying to recover from war and involves a small team doing their best to make things better. The team is made up of very familiar types; nothing new here. Despite that, I found myself liking the series. Alice is just so over the top as to be somewhat refreshing. Roland steps outside his stereotype often enough to be interesting (pulling at my heartstrings,) and the others do the same. There are moments of depth and brilliance I didn't expect. In short, this is a quick, fun, somewhat silly series that is just a bit deeper than it appears. Give it a rent. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
2,A good Watch,"I was really excited over this, b/c i'd gotten the manga and though the very few sites I'd heard the anime was pretty much 'ok'. The movie goes through a few stories, delves a little into each character's personalities and I've gotten to really like Stecchin and her voice actresses (Japanese and English!). She's a quirky little character, even if she isn't around for more than five minutes. 'The Big Guy' is an intriguing character, but this volume doesn't really do him any justice. He's just 'there' most of the time, doing his thing and letting the others hop out into the limelight. Orlend is the typical woman-chaser and 'romantic'; I like machis 'just because' he's the typical glasses wearing dorkish character. As for Alice...eh. I sorta get her, and then I don't. This volume is enjoyable, but not completely awesome, and I wish for more of a story development."
2,dumb than dumber.,"Mad magazine sent this picture up with the title ... 'Botch Cassidy and the Somedunce Kid'.And how right they were.It is a vehicle - a horse-drawn carriage - which delivers two concocted hollywood stars to get the studio system profits back to cover the pawnish musicals that were then dying, and no-one knew what else to do but throw a Western that way, (Shirley Jones might have been given Katherine Ross's role, if only she could ride a bike and keep her undies on) but this buddy movie, really, was only Dean and Jerry with stilettos. (Sorry, spurs.)It is a gay Western, and if you did not know better, the horses kind of looked happy, too."
5,Gifted Organist,"I had never heard of Joey DeFrancesco until I happened to be listening to various jazz organists on Amazon.com and I was impressed with the talent and style of Mr.DeFrancesco so I ordered this cd.When I read Mr.DeFrancesco was a teen when he recorded it I was astounded!His version of ""All of Me"" and ""Close to You"" are excellent!If you enjoy hearing a B3 played by a master I recommend this fine cd"
3,"Good material, weird dimensions","This is a solid, heavy memory-foam pillow (the ""pounds"" rating refers to its density). The 3lb density is more firm than the 2.5lb pillows.But I found the squared shape a bit uncomfortable. Since it tapers to its maximum thickness in the center, that means I was either sleeping kind of propped up on the pillow (edge of pillow was under my shoulders) or I was sleeping on the thinner edge of the pillow (no neck support there). That effect was greater for side-sleeping than back-sleeping.If you like to sleep a little propped-up and on your back, this would work well for you. It also layers well with a down pillow to make an extra-thick pillow. For my sleeping, I'd like to see this density in a longer, more rectangular pillow.I let new foam pillows air out for a few days before using them, but I did still notice a bit of a foam smell from the pillow when I used it (eg, from inside the pillow from the weight of my head) for the first couple of nights."
5,GREAT PILLOW,"Just the right softest for me! Helps my neck pain. I'm a back sleeper, so on my back all night. The height is a little to low for me so I use a small pillow under this one. I bought serval pillows before I got this one & they were to hard. This is just right!!! Best $40 I've spend on a pillow. just what I think, T"
4,I Actually Liked It,"Sister Mary is a dark comedy with mostly gay characters. Prior to seeing it, I had read only two reviews for it. One was mixed, and the other reviewer hated it. But I actually liked it. It is a very campy film, especially when comedian Ant is onscreen. And Brent Corrigan pops up in a cameo as a sex addict, and he takes off his shirt. Actually, many men take off their shirts in Sister Mary. Unfortunatly, that's all they take off, as there is no below the waist nudity. Sister Mary does have its problems. It is only fitfully funny, even if it never fails to entertain. And there are some sound problems, but only in a few scenes. Overall, though, Sister Mary is an interesting indie film with a twist that I didn't see coming."
4,Some good songs... some VERY bad...,"Those of you who heard the legends of BODY COUNT, and those of you returning for a second (or 3rd helping) of Ice T's hardcore/metal band are in for a few great tracks... plus a lot of really bad ones. The 1st track ""MY WAY"" rules. it's harder than any of the songs off the other BC albums. Total NYHC type vibe w/ a little more rap. Hard as nails for sure. STRIPPER is good fun (lyrically), but musically not so much. DR K has the oldschool feel, and there's one more dceent song. The rest... not worth checking out. but get it for MY WAY alone... it's worth it!!!!"
2,oh brother...(This is not a hoot.heh heh heh hehh.eh..),"I tried to see this book through.I really did.I wanted to finish what I started.I don't know if Garner has a genius mind,or a nutty one,but-whatever the case-I couldn't wrap my own head around it.Maybe if I hadn't been so bored,I'd have tried harder.But there was no way I would finish this weird thing,or buy another Alan Garner book.I used to read Shakespeare and it made more sense.All I can really tell you about the...um,plot..is that there were some plates and they had something to do with a girl who wanted to be a flower and hated owls.I don't know.Perhaps this novel is a work of brilliance in it's own way but not one I'm interested in.I would only recommend the novel to super-intelligents and /or extremely avid readers.It is not easy entertainment."
4,a real vision of African American politics.,"Osborne's book charts the rise and fall of a hypothetical politician in an attempt to better discover what makes and motivates the species. The book is extremely well researched with a liberal sprinkling of anecdotes, facts and conjecture. The writing style is gloriously indirect and verbose in a very history teacher way, something that might not appeal to all, but which for me added to the joy of reading. Definitely a buy recommendation if you have an interest in a real vision of African American politics."
5,Hollywood for real,"Clearly this is a love it or hate it book. I fell into the ""loved it"" group. Clever, funny, insightful - I feel sure this is how it is in the belly of the Hollywood beast, where a huge support staff toils to make their clients seem as glamorous and perfect as they really aren't, and the stars fear only one thing - being forgotten. Alex is trapped in what might seem to be a perfect job : publicity agent. When her agency specializing in B grade stars is taken over by an unscrupulous wheeler dealer, and her boss is about to be tossed out on the scrapheap, Alex discovers to her own surprise that she does care about decency and fairness and that she actually can make a small difference in the inherently unfair world of the glitterati.De Vries' Hollywood seems so real that I have to believe that this is how it really is. I'm already recommending the book to my friends and family."
2,What's Her Problem?,"I am chugging onward to the end of this book, with only about 20 turgid pages to go. A total waste of time. I usually like to read about working women--- I know first hand of the trials and tribulations. But the main character, Alex Davidson, does nothing through the entire book but gripe and complain, and it makes one wonder-- if she is so unhappy, why doesn't she get another job. The problem is-- it's not really clear why she is so unhappy. The group she works with is having problems, but hey--- don't we all. Also, it's never really clear what the big deal is-- a take-over, heads roll, but nothing makes real sense, reader-wise. I haven't been so turned off by a book since ""The Devil Wears Prada."" Which I couldn't bring myself to finish. If this is womanhood in the workplace, we're doomed. Back to the kitchen !!!"
5,Many points of inspiration,"This book isn't meant to be read from cover to cover (it's size is already a source of intimidation), but picked up from time to time, to surprise, to inspire, to entertain, to stimulate. A collection so worth the money!"
5,Encyclopedia of Inspiration,"Sometimes I am tempted to take a few days off from work and attempt to read ""The Art of Looking Sideways"" from cover to cover. Then I remind myself that I have my whole lifetime to enjoy it. I think of it as my encyclopedia of inspiration. An incredibly extensive collection of facts, quotes, images, anecdotes, concepts... anything a designer needs to get the gears turning and the ideas flowing. I would recommend it to anyone who desires a creative boost. I promise, it hasn't failed me yet."
1,look before you buy,"i just don't get it. i bought this based on the reviews and i just don't get it. i read a lot of graphic design and think i'm reasonably well versed in the field, but his just doesn't do it for me. See the other one star review about a dozen reviews down -- i agree completely. the two of us must just be missing something. maybe try and read an excerpt or something before buying. its a meaningless, jumbled, uninteresting mess."
5,A Piece of History,In this day in age I think its important to use any technological resource to capture history. Hurricane Katrina is a piece of history and I purchased When the Levees Broke so that I can show my children. My DVD was stolen when my place was burgularized. I came straight to Amazon because I knew that I could replace this particular DVD swiftly.
5,Spike Lee When the leeves broke,"I would highly recommend this documentary piece. I was blown away with the footage, but yet enlightened by the quality of the material."
4,Gives Great Perspective,"This 6-hour documentary offers a great range of perspectives on the Hurricane Katrina experience. While it builds useful context and explains many of the issues, some of the individuals who share commentary throughout seem overly extreme in their views; they share ""information"" that is interesting in that it informs their views, but is factually questionable. It would be hard to watch the whole thing straight through, but most viewers will find sections that answer their own questions about Hurricane Katrina. You'll almost certainly be left with more questions than you had when you started, but that's a good thing."
2,I only received two of the four Acts,"Spike Lee did an outstanding job on this documentory, and I felt it was very balanced in its approach. I just wish I had known that I was only going to receive Acts 2 & 3 of the documentory. Other than this discrepancy, it was a great DVD. I love the depiction of our present administration during this crisis, and our President's mother, wow!"
5,You'll Laugh Out Loud,"Finally, a book of ""Rants.""Miller and Rooney have selected a broad range of topics fromthe series and gathered them into what amounts to a tome oftimely sociological and political commentary. These ""essays""are both humorous and thought provoking at the same time.More than once you'll find yourself laughing aloud at someof the off the wall references made while commenting on suchtopics as OJ Simpson, Victimless Crime, and What is Rightwith America. If this book has one fault, it is that it istoo short.For anyone who wished they had taped Dennis Miller's ramblingmonologues from his HBO show, this book is for you. And forthose of you who may have never watched the show, you canget a taste of what you have been missing."
3,Miller Takes Sarcasm To New Heights,"The Rants is a collection of momologues from Dennis Miller's HBO series. Some of these editorials are hilarious, some poignant, others are crass and juvenile. No topic is off limits, but I think politically, Miller hangs a little to the left. Most are entertaining, but I'm sure the written word loses something in the translation from the performance. I read this book when I heard Miller would be joining the Monday Night Football crew--my guess is football will never be the same. Fans of his show will probably enjoy this more than non-fans."
4,Great music is the Outfield,"I was going to give this CD 3 stars rating, but since this album has Alan Jackman's final work, I gave it 4 stars. (After all, Alan Jackman was the reason I got into this band in the first place) Good, solid pop-rock band with great, almost flawless sound (vocals and all). The title track is especially strong, but the most noticable track is undoubtedly My Paradise. In Jakarta (where I used to live) it became a Top Ten hit, in New Zealand it was unheard of. Some of the tracks are pretty catchy (in a good way)and it's a shame that they didn't become mega hits. Take for an instance Night Ain't Over. If you like The Outfield then you must get this one. FAST."
2,Not so good!,"Now in my second statistics course, I have a great base in statistics. This book seems to confuse everything that i've already learned. I would recommend using The Basic Practice of Statistics over this book anyday."
2,Poor Sod,"Tony really oought to just give it up, especially if he's gonna do his stuff with these pathetic modern heavy metal idiots like Phil Anselmo. Only one track with Ozzy and hes the only decent vocalist on the whole album. Most of the riffs arent vintage black sabbath, the sound like some rubbish a modern band like godsmack or korn would do and that pathetic teenagers with baggy pants dropped down to their knees ""mosh"" to."
4,OLD AND NEW!!!,"I Think this album rocks. Tony is mixing it up with some of the new people in rock that he influenced over the years. The song with Phil(Pantera) is raw and loud and has a classic feel to it. I also like the song with Skin,man can she sing. This album definitely has that Tony sound but with a touch of new."
4,A Masterpiece by the master himself,"I love this album!It's so good and holds such a high quality. It's a collection of songs and different singers brought together on one album. There's not even one bad song on the album but i think there are some things missing.Now, this is why i gave the album 4 stars instead of five.Would have loved to see a song with Glenn Hughes on here. He would have fitted very well here. Also a song with Ronnie James Dio would have been wonderfull.And last but absolutely not least the remaining songs with Phillip Anselmo (of Pantera, Down, Superjoint Ritual) should have been on it as bonus songs. I happen to know there are 2 more songs with Anselmo, one called ""The Bastard"" and another one wich i know not that much about.Anyways, as the album is today it's great! It contains great great songs. To name a few really good ones:Goodbye Lament, Time Is Mine, Just Say No To Love and Patterns.Buy the album! it's all worth it"
1,WHAT were they thinking???,"Alright, I finally read Treasure Island and decided I needed to see a good interpretation on film. This ain't it. Treasure Planet and Muppet's Treasure Island were both humorous at least. This is the only other version I could find locally. It started off promising enough, then it went downhill fast and never looked back. The settings and costumes were simply beautiful though. If you are hoping for a true-to-book movie this is the farthest thing possible. Frankly, it stinks."
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Looks like the guys from Videodrone were alot better when they were known as Cradle of thorns. don't get me wrong, I loved the Videodrone cd, but I think that this cd is much better because vocalist Ty Elam doesn't moan as much, and that they combine hip-hop with their music as well. Funk-Metal if you wish."
5,Mind Altering,"If you are into Gregorian chanting, you will love this disc. It is uniformly spectacular and nothing but pure pleasure. I'm not sure how it could be any better. Hard to find and highly recommended."
1,weak hinge mechanism,"The tongs don't stay open unless the hinge is parallel to the floor. If you wanted to flip a steak in a pan you'd have to force the tongs open before you grab the food (the force of gravity keeps them closed). The spring mechanism is a single sheet of metal which slowly flexes back into place, not a spring mechanism (like a mousetrap). Bad design."
5,Great Gift for Granddaughter,"Egypt: Yesterday and TodayAfter reading this beautifully illustrated table-top book comparing Egyptian scenes of the past and present, we purchased it for our granddaughter who is planning a career as an Egyptologist. The artwork is super, and the narrative is clear and crisp. An outstanding gift."
3,"Not very readable, but lot's of info","Perhaps I was under the wrong impression when I bought this, I thought it had general advice on importing, things like ""where to find the best silk in China"" and some personal anecdotes. Since it wasn't really reading material, per se, but more like a book for lawyers or a reference for someone already importing stuff or about to, I wasn't really impressed. I suppose that for someone needing the hard facts, rules, regs, etc, then this would be a good book, but if you're looking for an easy to read, filled with advice kind book, look elsewhere."
4,A Wooing Sort of Romance,"I have to say that I really liked the tension that was created through this book. Although the Sheik ""liked"" his bride, he didn't realize how much he would grow to love her. Having come out of a passionless first marriage, he brought his own weaknesses to the relationship, which his virgin bride was incapable to deal with other than to see herself as the one that was disappointing him.The story was quick to read, the characters felt developed enough for me to genuinely care about them, and it was a fun story to escape into."
5,Awesome CD,"Now, let's go over the basics:Vocals/lyrics go very well with the beats and riffs. Singer has a certain tone to his voice that compliments the whole song.Guitar: Best. Ever. The riffs are so smooth that you can't help but stop to listen. Very addicting.Bass: Works well with the whole band.Drums: Dude comes out with some good beats.In general, all the members work together to produce quality songs that just scream for attention. It's my favourite CD - I've already placed an order for their newer one ""Sophomore Slump""."
4,Epperley,"Can't believe i found this song. I had the surf video by ...Lost 5'5"" 19 1/2"" a long time ago. Tom Currens section was set to their song, I decieded to find the song and try to get it and Amazon had it...You can watch the video section of Curren shaping a boad and ripping at their web site [...]"
2,choose a different one,"this is not a book. it never made it that far along the writing process. it's a collection of brief thoughts sometimes loosely related, sometimes totally random. only about 20% of the entries have anything to do with the ""predjudices of morality"". there are plenty of really interesting entries but you gotta sift through a lot of nonsense. unless you're really studying nietzche the man in depth, stay away and pick one of his more famous titles. this would be a waste of time."
4,Pass the night away,...I enjoyed 'Night Passage' it was a modern day western with a very likeable hero.
2,Night Passage,"Absolutly the worst book that I have read from Parker, I have read most of the, this is the most disappointing."
2,Typical Parker.. except,"I always shake my head and smile when I read Robert B. Parker's novels. That I keep reading them is evidence of his talent as a writer. Even so, after about the first 20 pages, I could not help but notice that Jesse Stone is simply a re-working of the Spenser character. I still hold out the hope that someday, Parker will get over his hangups about conservatives, organized religion, the concept of man and wife, and surburbia. The sub-plot about the right-wing militia was laughable! In Massachusetts of all places?? Parker's blind faith in The Professional Therapist as the god-given solution to all of man's problems is passing out of the annoying phase and is now in the realm of nauseating. Its sad that a man of such talent has such a stunted, fatalistic view of Man. If only Parker can overcome this handicap, he will possibly make the leap from fair to good."
2,Not nearly as good as the Spenser novels,"After the first thirty pages, I was ready to put this book down. Parker can write, there's no doubt about that, but I didn't like how he handled third-person POV or the fact that he shifts POV from character to character. The storyline is pretty predictable, which is okay usually if the characters are engaging but I just couldn't get close to them. This book doesn't even come close to The Godwulf Manuscript (the first Spenser novel). I own all of Parker's Spenser books in hardcover but I wouldn't spend my money on even the paperback version of this one. Why two stars? Because, as I said earlier, Parker can write. He just should pick better characters to use his talent on."
2,Not For Me,Not a genre I normally read but I liked the Jesse Stone movies so I wanted to give it a try. It was not for me.
2,"Good yarn, not enough action, dull dialog, no characters.","Parker has obviously tired of Spenser, his super hero detective of many years. Now we have Jesse Stone, flawed, silent, alone. To his credit he is tough, honest, decisive. What made Parker a success was his lively, witty characters, brought home by great dialog. This book has no memorable dialog and all the characters are thin. The protagonist, Jesse Stone, needs some development to make him more interesting. The story line is as good as Parker's previous work, but he'll have to grow Stone considerably, beef up some other characters, to keep me coming back every year as I did for his Spenser novels."
2,I won't buy another,"I like good mysteries, but this wasn't one of them. The guy can write, but this was way too predictable and the characters were too shallow. He's certainly no Patricia Cornwell or James Patterson. I gave this two stars for his use of the English language. This took about three hours to read."
2,Mad Scientist McDaniel,"In what appears to be the last of his ""experimental"" studio efforts, the ardent Bo Diddley collector is treated to two compelling cuts (Tracks 1 & 2: ""Promises"" and ""Kids Don't Do It"") and three more better left on the shelf after one audition. It can be said, though, that Bo finally got his ""sound"" after several years of electronics dabbling: the above-mentioned titles have Singles Chart potential, in fact ""Kids"" was later redone [overdubbed?] with All-Star backing for the critically acclaimed Atlantic album."
1,Battery life is a joke!,"Unless you have 5 of these batteries, you cannot even shoot a 60 minute tape. It is preposterous -- to have this battery as the standard for this video camera."
2,Better off with a collection of interesting haggadot,"I hate to put out a negative review on something others seem to get so much out of, but I am disappointed in this book. First it makes the assumption that a traditional seder is boring; then it suggests more readings and long texts which seem to only serve to make for a longer and duller seder.I collect haggadot and use passages and activities from different ones each year. I'd suggest looking through any selection of haggadot for new perspectives and commentary rather than tackling the uninspiring passages presented her"
5,Seder As History,"Each year we try to construct a Seder that will remind people of the origins of each portion of the Seder and of other similar events from other cultures and other events from our own culture that grow out of the seder. The impecable organization of this book and the important, striking information in this volume have made this years prepartion infinitely more fun. I am quite grateful that it exists."
5,A must have for Passover,"This book is a ""must have"" for anyone's Passover Seder. We all know how they tend to become the same, year after year - same leader, same prayers, same songs, same text. If you want your Seder to be different this year, as well as more meaningful and educational, get this book asap!"
3,Repetition,"I have loved all of the princess diaries books up until the 4th one. The book just ended up being the same story over over and over. Nothing special really happens and its an okay read i guess. Basically, its 'I love Micheal!!!' and 'I hate princess lessons!!!' and that's it."
1,This book is terrible,"The first three books were good, but when this one came out it was a big dissapointment because it was so ...ultra boring."
4,Great..but not as great as the first 3,"This book had the same old humor and funny plotline as the other 3, but mia changed when she gets worried too much about her relationships, and what about the other old characters? But it made me LOL, just like the other books."
4,WAHOO!!!,"When books are made into movies, the author usually ends up making their following books as cheesy and as bad as the movie, or not follow the regular plot. Well, this book isn't like those other ones. This one seems to ignore the movie, and continue on with it's pattern. I really enjoyed this one, and it's just as amusing as the rest. Mia is always amusing and you can totally relate to her struggles. Read it, It's great. TRUST ME!!!"
1,Princess in waiting,The book was good it told alot about princess Mia she was a princess of Ginovia she did not know she was a princess at first until her grandmother came and told her and took her on a journy to become a princess and she tryed her best and she did great.
3,She should have stopped at book # 3,"When I heard a 4th princess diaries book was coming out I was pretty excited. Then I read it and found it a bit disappointing. In the beginning Mia pretty much just complains about missing Michael and worrying if he is cheating on her with a brown-eyed blue-eyed girl named Kate Bosworth (this whole Kate Bosworth thing was brought up WAY too many times throughout the entire book). Once we move beyond that, the rest of the book is okay but nothing great. I'm sorry but this book doesn't have the same wit and intelligence as the last 3 books did. Meg Cabot should have stopped and left The Princess Diaries as a trilogy."
4,"Good book, but","I originally got this book when it first came out. I also had one of those classes where you could meet the author. Her name is pronounced Spung gen with a hard G. The only problem I have about this Kindle version of book I downloaded is that there are no pictures in the kindle version, unlike the original paperback book version."
1,Sad mom's way out,"Nancy Spungeon was a friend of mine, and she was not the way this book portrays her. Nancy was a sweet girl. If you read this book, please consider that it may tell more about the mother than the daughter. The mother wrote this book to try to absolve herself of any responsibility and blame it all on Nancy. THAT is nothing new. If you read this book, please give Nancy some of the compassion she never got from home."
2,One juror couldn't have that much influence!,"I bought this book at the airport for a 3.5 hour flight. The first part of the book was typical Grisham, but as the main juror started influencing or fooling every other character in the book, I felt compelled to continue only because I invested the $7. Each chapter with Nicolas spying for the judge, sabbotaging other jurors, manipulating the tobacco big wigs...just did not buy it. The other constant that shows up here that is Grisham's formula ending was the two conspirers getting the money, and meeting up in some exotic destination away from the US. Grisham has got to put more thought into his endings. Until then, I will not buy another Grisham novel until I read the reviews on this webpage"
2,"Unconvincing, Predictable, and Judgemental","A story based upon one individual dictating to the judge, the lawyers, and the fellow jurors was not a plausible one even with our fallible judicial system. Grisham is making a strong political statement with this book at the expense of literary acumen. It was just not believable....all this investigative money and they don't know Marlee and Easter are having conjugal visits??? C'mon....you have to be awfully gullible to digest this one"
3,Really good start and middle but the end was too predicatble,"Thats it John boys done it again, much better than latest Partner(noticed striking similarities though) Twist at the end totally expected should have double twisted it ( but not as in Partner- very frustrating - uncalled for- no reason to-get the point JG??) Overall ok book. good addition to collecter's of JG bks"
4,Unlikeable Hero/Heroine,"I'm a big fan of John Grisham's books, and usually give them 5 stars. But I just can't with Runaway Jury. Mostly because I felt the main characters, Marlee and Nicholas Easter were easily the most unlikable protagonists in Grisham's novels to date.For most of the novel the reader is left in the dark about Marlene's and Nicholas' true motivation. Are they grifters? Are they shameless opportunists? Or Sly Anti-Tobacco crusaders? No one can tell, and for me, by the end of the novel, I just didn't particularly care.Marlee: is portrayed as a cold-calculating rich girl. Nichols: A petty babyish man, who I had difficulty believing could inspire loyalty in anyone. By the end of this book, I kept rooting for the Villain Rankin Fitch. At least his motivations were clear, and he had a certain amount of charm.Overall, while the plot and story concept was good. The two main characters just did NOT work for me."
4,Trial against Big Tobacco,"Successful conspiracy to be on a jury and communicating with someone else to let it be known to the defense (Big Tobacco) that you can and will determine the outcome, favorable to the defense, in exchange for a hugh bribe. Includes a doublecross after accepting the bribe.Although, interesting and well written, I find it required too many implasable events in series to be logical. Nevertheless, I greatly enjoyed the book."
4,Suspenseful Legal Thriller,"A very satisfying read. Once the trial starts the roller-coaster ride is on, and what a thrilling ride it is. Why this hasn't been made into a movie is beyond me. Chilling and awesome."
2,"Too solemn, not too fascinating.","In the beginning, the story look like fascinating, but the toneof the story was too solemn. Not much real action, as other book asThe Pelican Brief, The Firm. ^M However the story still Ok and new that press us to read to the end."
3,"Enjoyable, but slower than the others","I read this while I was sitting in the court house waiting to be called for Jury Duty. ( I thought that would be kind of humorous). It seems to have gone into too much detail in areas and some of the characters seem way too unrealistic. It just didn't keep the pace of The Client, A Time to Kill or any of the others. But at the same time, it was enjoyable enough that I didn't want to stop reading it. I would still recommend it to a friend. ( I have read every Grisham book to date and this is probably on the bottom of the list in order of liking, but just the same it WAS liked)"
2,This book has no protagonist!,"I could not empathize with a single character -- they were all too weak, too greedy, and too gullible. The message, which seemed to be, ""I'm not responsible for my own life and my own choices, somebody owes me"" while ludicrous, is an accurate reflection of real life in the Irresponsible 90's. I wanted something bad to happen to at least one of these whining, conniving wimps"
2,Not Mr. Grisham's best work.,"The plot was slow-moving and thoroughly uninteresting. The characters were not well developed. Although the author tried to give us insight into each and every juror's psyche, I couldn't tell what made them tick. I also found it hard to keep track of these people in my mind as I read: 12 jurors, 3 extras, countless lawyers on each side and even more outside parties working undercover for the lawyers.The best aspect of the novel was the thorough and elaborate description of the effects of smoking and tobacco companies themselves.The book was a fast read, but certainly not a page-turner."
3,"Unbelievable, but still a page-turner","I'm a fan of Grisham's, despite the predictability of his last couple of books. Although I found myself annoyed that I could predict the outcome and plot twists, and the story's treatment of the legal system was not at all realistic, I still found the book to be entertaining and fun to read."
3,Not one of his better works.,"At the time I read this book I was on a big Grisham binge. I loved his early works and had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately this book didn't live up to the standard he had set in his other books (The Firm, The Pelican Brief).The story revolves around a large tobacco suit. Much of the story is spent in the courtroom hearing the arguments for and against tobacco use. The rest of the story is about the jury and the manipulation of the jury by outside forces.Although as with other Grisham books I found fascinating information on jury selection, sequestering, etc. the story just didn't have the pull I was looking for. The ending was predictable and seemed to have been penned quickly to finish the book.If you are a diehard Grisham fan, then read this book. Otherwise pick up one of his earlier books for an excellent read."
3,Just One More Grisham,"""The Runaway Jury"" is the story of a young man with law experience risking his life, and that of his attractive love interest, to bring down big corporations for the good of all humanity.Sound familiar?If so, you're not crazy. You're not the only one that hears this and is immediately reminded of ""The Firm,"" ""The Rainmaker,"" and virtually every other Grisham book ever written. (Oh, there are some exceptions. Sometimes the attractive love interest isn't just two paragraphs of steamy action on the beach, but even has some speaking roles.) No, you're not alone. Some readers are beginning to scratch their heads and mutter that this is sounding awfully familiar...So if you've never read any Grisham books before, this is a great read. If you're not one of the lucky few, then steer clear, unless you want to be able to recite the plot without reading a page."
4,One of the better ones,"I've read several Grisham books, some I really like and some get a little slow. I'm working my way through all of his books and this one was one of the better ones, in my opinion. The story of Easter and Marlee keep you interested throughout the book and this one has a good ending where many of his books don't, again that's just my opinion."
4,Most enjoyable - kept me guessing throughout,This is one of the better Grisham books that I have read. It kept me trying to think ahead to see if I could figure out what was going to happen and how. I found that it kept me reading long after I should have moved on to other things.
1,not good at all,"This is the worst Grishim book I have ever read. It's just one of those books where it is really hard to turn the page, because you know what's going to happen next,but I belive Grishim has written many ""classics"" like the firm,and the rainmaker. He just needs to throw this one out because it is so B-O-R-I-N-G!!!!!!!"
5,One of Grisham's best efforts. A real page-turner.,"The Runaway Jury is Grisham at his best. As the pages turn, you become gripped by the story of a jury in a civil suite vs. a large tobacco company. You become privi to the inner thoughts of the jury as they are controlled and manipulated from all sides until they finally reach their verdict. Anyone who loves a good legal thriller, as well as anyone who has strong opinions of the growing tobacco debate, will enjoy this book cover to cover. The Runaway Jury is a real hit"
3,"Same Grisham Style, slightly different context.","This book gripped me at the start but lost the pace towards themiddle, turning into the same old story, just with the jury instead ofthe lawyers. I'd even figured out many of the plot twists before they occured!Overall, it is pretty funny in parts but nothing particularly new."
2,Is Grisham still writing his own books?,"You can count on Grisham to be entertaining and a quick read, which this was for the most part. Beyond that, he must consider his readers as moronic as the people on ""The Runaway Jury"" to find any credibility in this story. It was better than sappy Bleachers or Skipping Christmas but my respect for Grisham's writing has taken a dive. He's always going to the edge of what can be believed and his characters tend to be stereotypes, but Grisham has lost respect for his readers to put out something like this. I've read everything he's written and this is my last."
4,The Runaway Jury,"This is the first John Grisham book i have read. I liked the novel, but at times it jumped around from character to character too fast. The story takes place in the courtroom in Biloxi, Mississippi, where a widow has sued the tobacco industry for the death of her husband. The Protagonist Nicholas Easter and his girlfriend Marlee have been following tobacco litigation for years and finally Nicholas makes it on the jury. The rest of the novel deals with Nicholas and Marlee manipulating the Jury and the Defense's hired ""man"" Rankin Fitch to secure the verdict they want. The jury is being controlled, but which way will it go? The novel is filled with suspense and twists at almost every other chapter. Like i said earlier this is the first Grisham book i have read so i cant compare it to others, but I will definetley now read more of John Grisham's books. If you haven't read this one and you like Grisham i'm sure this one is a must read."
2,No characters to root for,"This book is seriously flawed. The reader of a novel usually likes to identify with, or at least root for, a character he deems likable. In ""The Runaway Jury,"" Mr. Grisham makes it extremely difficult for his readers to do this. One cannot honestly admire either of the protagonists, Marlee or Nicholas, for all the shenanigans they pull with their lying and cheating as they seek revenge on the tobacco industry. For this reason alone, I give this book a thumbs down."
3,This book needed an editor who knows how to cut the drivel!!,"I wish that authors didn't think they would disappoint their readers if each new book isn't substantially longer than the last. Remember when Dick Francis books (the 150 page variety) were fun to read? This bloated story with no likeable characters was almost as tedious to read as it is to participate on a jury. However, I did read the whole book because I actually was interested in the basic plot and the final outcome, if even it was predictable"
1,Villains Win,"This is the first book that I ever quit reading 100 pages from the end because it was obvious that the lawbreaking villians, Nicholas Easter and his partner in crime, Marlee, were going to win and would not be punished for the crime of jury tampering."
4,Book of Books...for those like Gaston,"I bought this book for school. So, I'm glad I purchased it. Unfortunately for the publishers, this book is full of false information. The best part it that it has great pictures that show the history of book making and old manuscripts beautifully. So, double check the information, but enjoy the pictures! :D"
1,After co-parenting with a great father - I see the need,"Drexler's book misses the point and seems more to me to be a message about extreme feminism then rational logic backed up by truthful research. After raising a boy along with a good Father, I can clearly see the importance of both parents and the mix of views, aspirations, drive, and sensebilities that they each have to offer. This book advocates more simply that we should raise men to be more like women and if we manage to accomplish this we are all clearly in big trouble.[...]I guess Drexler liked the sound bite approach to two parents in society:Deadbeat DadsMaverick Moms.[...]"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,Mothers and fathers provide unique and invaluable contributions toward the development of their children. Each parent's contributions to the upbringing of their children are indistinguishable and equally necessary to assure children the best opportunity to develop into healthy citizens. It should be a crime to falsely state the facts like this book does.
1,A Waste of Time.,"It fails all of the important criteria for a good book: It's not well-written, it's not interesting or engrossing, and much of the content is implausible. It is controversial, however; and once its notoriety has evaporated, it'll be forgotten."
5,necessary information on the 21st century family,"News flash: children require engaged parents, not parents with particular genital equipment. As someone who has seen Dr. Drexler speak and knows some of her interviewees, it is shocking to hear her portrayed as a ""radical feminist"". Her research is thorough and aimed at a broad base of readers, and her conclusions are not news to some of us, but it is helpful to have it legitimized by a more mainstream researcher. Children require engaged parenting, and the gender of the available, interested, thoughtful parent is less important than the quality of their parenting. Dr. Drexler's book validates this finding, and the critiques against her book found here in Amazon appear to me to be politically based."
4,2 year old favorite!,"my 2 1/2 year old daughter thinks this is the funniest book. every time I read it and say 'underwear', she giggles and repeats it herself."
4,Good Scale reference book,"It's good as a scale reference book. here you can find from synthetic scales to exotic scales, fingerins about all the freetboard... Also check ""The Ultimate Guitar Scale Bible"" for a much moore complete reference scale book."
1,not as exciting as i thought!!,"I picked up this book from this book sale, and from the sound of it, it seemed pretty exciting. But once I started reading, it didn't sit well with me. ESP and medieval 'time travelling' is great and all that, but it didn't have the emotional aspect of it. The 'link' Juniper and Dylan shared weren't exaclty expressed properly. Overall, it wasn't what I was expecting. You may like it, but it wasn't my type of book."
4,Not Just a Kid's Book,"Is it an action-packed, edge-of-your-seat thriller? No. But it is a story of young love and learning to help each other through issues you can't control. If you are looking for a nice break from adult romance with a side order of time travel then this is the book for you.I'll definitely look for other books by Sherryl Jordan."
1,Paul Reiser is NOT funny.,"If there was an option for 0 stars, I'd put that down. Paul Reiser is not funny on Mad about You, he is not funny as a stand-up comedian, and he is certainly not funny in this story. The dog Murray on Mad about You is funnier than Paul."
1,No way two rifles will fit,There is no way you are going to fit two scoped rifles in this case. I have two relatively small air rifles with very low profile mounts. They don't even come close to both fitting. I don't even think I could get one scoped and one open sighted rifle in this case. For the money it is fine for one rifle but don't buy it to put two in there.
4,pressure washer,this pressure washer works well. i think it should come with some extra washer that they advise you to buy
5,Excellent glass plugs!,"I've seen plenty of tunnels in double flare for 00g and larger, but this was the first time I ran across tunnels like this: single flare, and 6g. They were just as described, a deep, rich garnet color. They were well-made, and the price was unbeatable."
1,Yuck!!!!,This book (I refuse to call it literature) was a big waste of my time. I was told this was a great book (obviously by people with bad taste) and forced myself through the whole book assuming something would change and I would see why it was so great. Nothing ever happened. This book is not even good enough to sit on my bookshelf. My husband and I are having a ceremonial book burning of this book this weekend so that nobody else will suffer through it
2,Trash,"This book started out with great promise and finished up with a horrible ending, glorifying adultery and senseless death. The author has excellent use of language and description, but a distorted idea of how to weave an uplifting plot. Grace might have been better served by an honorable mother and a cowboy who thought more of a young girl's life than his own hormones. This book was a big disappointment"
1,LOUSY!!!,The book started well but quickly fizzled out and towards the end degenerated into something like a really nauseating Mills & Boon.The parts of the book dealing with the horses were the only redeeming features - not enough of them though.I wish there was some kind of money-back scheme for lousy books.
1,Degenerates from a promising start to a cheap ending,"The premise of this book is so fascinating that it is hard not to be swept up into it immediately. The glimpses into the sometimes brutal world of horse training and the kinder gentler alternatives are so interesting that it is too bad the author felt the need to introduce a tawdry and altogether unlikely romance into the mix. The idea that a woman who is so wrapped up with her daughter's needs would betray her for an idealized new-age Marlboro man is so beyond belief that it cheapens the rest of the author's work. Although the author tries to present the perfect hero, he merely betrays his own dearly held stereotypes of women and what (he thinks) they want out of life."
3,"Um, It was okay","The book was awesome, very descriptive (though in some parts we didn't that full detail! ) My concern if for Pilgrum. That horse suffered and went through hell for Annie. Grace was in the right of mind saying he should be put down. No horse should have to go through that, ever. As some of you said about Annie- ""She was a hero for not putting the horse down"" No, she wasn't, she was a monster. That horse suffered beyond belief. Though it may not seem like it, think of being there though, and seeing the horse in pain. The hell he went through will never be made up to him, all because of SNOBBIE Annie. I did not like her, and I found her much less than a hero. I liked Grace and Tom, the twins and the other boy...forget his name. Anyways I recommend the book, but Annie should have thought in Pilgrums best intrest, not her own.Over all, Awesome movie and book.Anyone at all can e-mail me with their comments (LuvTBracin@aol.com or Dani82985@aol.com)"
1,Awful,"It's as if the author got tired, had a deadline to meet so chose the fastest, easiest and most predictable way to go. An insult to the reader. He must have already received the money for the movie rights before the book was finished."
4,A Good Book Until the End,"I thought this book was really good. Evans makes the begining graphic, but I think that helps with understanding all that has to be recovered mentally and physically by all involved. The development between Tom, the horse, and the daughter as well as between the daughter and mom was well worth reading. I did not like the end of the novel. Tom was not in character at all and I could have done with out the relationship between Tom and the mom."
3,Good story; cop-out ending (fixed in movie),"I picked this book up because I was interested in the notion of horse training, and I'd heard good things about the story.The beginning was stunning, brilliantly written, and the story unfolded pretty well. And then came the ending, which was worthless.I'm not going to spoil the ending, but I am going to talk about the movie.Robert Redford's company bought the film rights to this movie. In the course of getting it into film, Redford spoke to the author and said, ""I hope you don't mind, but we are going to change the ending. Finishing the story, as you have done, is nothing but a cop-out. The characters have been put into a situation that they will need to resolve, and ending the story as you ended the book does nothing for that.""He was right. Read the book and then watch the last twenty minutes of the movie."
2,Where is the story,"I could not get into it. I read ten chapters but it was a real struggle. Fantasy family, fantasy children, fantasy life, tragedy hits. It just could not draw me into the pages.Nothing novel about the characters, nothing novel and the story line, and nothing novel about this novel."
1,"Hackneyed, Cliched, Trite...","I wasn't impressed with this book at all. The plot wasn't very interesting and the characters seemed flat and unsympathetic. Evans' research is impressive, but it was not enough to salvage this book."
1,I was sucker-punched into buying this,"Help! Is this what Americans want at the end of the millenium? Mangled horses, mangled kids, emotionally crippled adults. Evans does a great job of appealing to shallow emotions. I'd rather read about wars or serial killers. Those are true horrors."
1,It STINKS!!!,"WE as readers were promised a touching story about a girl and her horse. Unfortunately this is what we got: Not much of a plot, bad writing, and very little of what could have been a beautiful story of the love between a owner and his/her horse. Very disapointing and not worth the time it takes to read the back of the book."
2,"If you've read ""Bridges,"" you've read half this book already","Our reader's club at work selected this book based on the hope of encountering some mystical explanation of healing and suffering, with perhaps insights into human behavior. Not so. It ended up being a dressed-up romance novel. The book was adequately written with positive male performances. But the women readers took a quick dislike to the heroine, and branded her a flake; they were unable to connect with her and her rationale. The ending was unsatisfying and abrupt"
1,"Oh, Horse pucky!","I can't believe I actually made it through the end of this book! I just don't understand how anyone can glean anything meaningful from this book. I have found, however, that it serves as an excellent paperweight. I sure won't be running off to see this movie, Redford or no. Hats off to the promoters of this book, though. To sell so many copies just emphasizes P.T. Barnum's wisdom...there IS one born every minute"
1,Tedious and cliched,"I found this book to be so appallingly written that I just wanted it to be over. The plot was formulaic and the characters horrendously stereotyped. Evans redeemed himself slightly with his descriptions of the surroundings, but it wasn't enough to save this novel. The fact that the film rights had been bought well before completion of the novel seemed glaringly obvious, and as I read it, I felt like I was trapped in a B-grade romance. I guess I have only myself to blame - I got suckered into the hype, and had high expectations. Never have my expectations come crashing back to earth with such a deafening thud. Avoid it at all costs."
1,Horse Poop,"phew! This book tries desperately to be mystical and romantic but fails. Horrifically. It is a wonder why this one made the bestseller list, much less a film! The characters are wishy-washy and so is the entire plot(?). And the ending! Ho-hum. I tried to give this book the benefit of the doubt, but in summary, I was suckered by the opine of the masses. Please don't bother."
1,Romance novel masquerading as fine writing.,"I can't help but flinch at the writing in this book. Submitted for your approval, quotes from the book.""But if this were wrong, then what in the whole of life was right?""""She turned herself loose to the liquid rhythm of their coupling and found beyond its sorrow some brief oblivion.""""She gave him a sad smile then looked up at the moon in its new place and trapped pieces of it in her eyes.""Trapped pieces of it in her eyes?! Ouch! That's gotta hurt! PLEASE! This book should have Fabio on the cover! This would've been rejected by any freshman creative writing class. Mr. Evans attempts at revealing the thoughts and feelings of an adolescent girl and a grown woman all sour as well. This book has bamboozled so many people. Sure wish I were a novelist who could command that kind of cash though! END"
4,Enjoyed Grace's relationships,"More than the story about Tom's life or Annie as the central character, I enjoyed the relationships that Grace had in her life. I was especially touched by the father/daughter relationship. I also liked the development of Annie and Grace's mother/daughter relationship. The comaraderie she had with Joe was great to see and the relationship with Tom, and how it suffered towards the end, was interesting and believable too. The Pilgrim/Grace relationship was like a true friendship, based on trust, hurt, then slowly rebuilt. The development of the Tom/Annie relationship was a bit unbelievable and cliche for me. The fact that Annie was protrayed as the main character confused me a little. But, overall I though the book was well-written and worth reading."
2,"Great beginning, the end was awful","The first 350 pages were wonderful. I loved and could relate with the characters and relationships. The last 100 pages however, I found myself rolling my eyes. I'm sick of books, movies, etc. acting like a few days of hot sex is the most amazing, cosmic-driven thing in the world. I could think of ten men I could have hot sex with for four days. That's not amazing. What's amazing is when you can spend four, ten , forty years with someone and still have love, pasison, and fun. THAT is amazing, not this. I also found it ridiculous that this girl had been through a horrible ordeal, finds healing, then her mother puts her through a whole other horrible ordeal. But she is presented as the female Beaver Cleaver at the end - I don't buy it."
1,The boringest book I've ever read....,"This book is very boring. I tried to read it, but after 20 pages I gave up, because it's full of horses. I hate horses. Especially horses which create an accident. But it's very funny (lustig) when the truck hit the horse and it flies (I believe I can fly) through the air. But it is very sad that Grace had lost her leg. Overall it should be a sad book, but for me it's a funny story for laughing. Thank you for reading. Your german horse-hater...(Das ist uns nicht freiwillig eingefallen.)"
1,The Horse Whisperer is overrated.,"The opening paragraph of the first chapter suggests a work of great depth and feeling, but after the first page, dissolves into writing that is comparable only to that of the non-dimensional Danielle Steel. As with Ms. Steel, Evans tells the reader everything rather than letting the plot and characters evolve and allowing a friendship to develop between characters and reader. Horse Whisperer is a story about paper doll people with no depth or dimension. Evans has taken what could have been an extraordinary story and has reduced it to nothing. I've heard the movie is exceptional, but do not want to waste my time and my money to see it."
1,The worst book I have read this year....,"While the quest to help both a young girl and her horse overcome the psychological effects of a terrible accident could have made a good plot, the actual plot development is unbelievable. In addition, the dialog of the characters is flat. The characters are not very likable, and are difficult to identify with.For all the terrific press this book received, I would have expected much better."
2,Disappointed,"It was a good start. At least the first few chapters caught my attention. But as time went by, alas, the writer surely got something to distract him. This book is not like the Bridge of Madison County at all. This book is about an extremely selfish woman who uses her childhood as a lasting excuse for whatever she does to others and a man who is emotionally so weak that just kills himself instead of living through hardships. And poor horses, they are never the center of this book except on the cover picture and title. The author tried very hard to justify an adultery but lacked enough appeals to make an adultery a love story. And the ending(more, his death)was very, very, disappointing. I am sure that a man of inner balance would never give up so easily."
3,A promising start...,"After an entertaining start, this book failed to hold my attention. The more I read, the more predictable the story became, and by the end I was even tempted to throw in the towel and not bother finishing. This was Nicholas Evan's first novel. I won't hurry to buy his next"
3,"Good story, bad language,poor ending","I really liked the story. It kept me interested from the start. I found that some of the language used didn't need to be there. Cursing was used all to frequently, and for me seemed to cheapen the story. The ending was a huge let down, it left you hanging"
1,Overly mushy and formulaic.,"yawn yawn yawn. It was a terrible read. I don't know how I even got through reading the book. I thought the writer's portrayal of the women was awful, cliche-like, and overly melodramatic. This is not the book for you to entertain yourself with because it reads like some boring adult version of Beverly HIlls 90210. I like reading books that I can relate to. I'm sorry if I can't relate to females who can't keep their marriage vows or who are going through some sort of mid life crisis even though they have the best of everything in their career, marriage, and kids. I seem to be against it because the writer seems to encourage and stand by these awful morals."
4,Satisfying Modern Western,"Girl and horse, both with internal and external scars, get help from a cowboy horse-doctor with an unusual hayside manner. Cowboy and girl's mother fall in love and dally around, even though she's still married -- kind of a Bridges of Madison County on horseback. All this inevitably leads to tragedy, which is what a good moral-corral story is all about. And author Nicholas Evans makes it all worthwhile with unequaled foreshadowing that makes you want to turn the pages harder, and descriptions of western scenes that make you want to saddle up and ride the range. No wonder they made a movie of it, but this story doesn't have a Hollywood ending. Which is a good reason in itself to read this version, so you won't miss the big surprise; even in tragedy, there is renewed hope."
2,Loved it; Hated it,"Reading this book I couldn't help getting teary-eyed mainly because of the visual images it conjures (the horse interactions, Montana, the warm family). The whisperer is a bigger than life hero that has a calmness and maturity you can't help but admire until his affair. The graphic details of lovemaking, etc is so out of place for this Disney-like character not to mention his eventual, sappy demise. You suddenly realize he's no hero and doesn't have it together at all."
2,Book the screen. A good bet for success,"First there was Robert Redford and Montana and profit in the mind of our screenwriter/author. Then came some experience with horses; life, (a little), sex, (more as a formula for success), and, voila, a book! A convoluted process, a convoluted book."
5,An Outstanding Novel With Love and Adventure,This is a great novel. I thought it was great how the author tied in love and adventure. He made you feel like you were there watching the whole time. You learn how an accident with a horse can change your whole life forever. The novel is about a young girl who get's in a horrific horse accident and looses her leg. The novel takes them to Montana where they get help from Tom a horse whisperer. The girl's mother falls in love with Tom and doesn't know how to deal with her feelings. What will the girl do when she finds out? What will they do when they fall in love? How will she tell her husband? Read the book to find out!!!!!
1,Melodramatic ending ruins an otherwise great book,"While I was reading this book, I would have given it 5 stars -- excellent writing, engaging characters, page-turning storyline. Then, it's like someone else decided to finish the book for Evans -- someone who didn't read the first 3/4 of the book. The ending is so ridiculously bad that I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I don't have difficulty with sad endings, but this ending is too absurd to even be sad. You might as well rent the movie instead. (Something I very rarely recommend.) They created a different ending that actually fits the rest of the book."
2,The hype was a roar....the read was a whisper.....,"This book was recommended to me by a younger friend who really loved it. I was disappointed in the lengthy drawn-out narratives of the scenery. The character of the husband was nothing but a stereotype, only part of the story because without him there would be no sexual tension and thus no real story. I thought the book was boring and predictable except for the ending......that earned the two star rating.....if it weren't for the surprise ending it would be just another Bridges of Madison County. I liken the plot to a Harlequin Romance ....it's all circumstantial and a lot of mush. I'm not above the romance for romance's sake when I'm in the mood for a light read, but Evans spent too much time setting up the story before anything really happened. To his credit, I hear the book is much better than the movie."
5,"""Deep"" or Superficial","It is very interesting to discover how different people can experience a story being told. To some it might be a silly predictable lovestory, to others a story with, another story beneath. I belong to the ""others""."
1,Utter Horse manure,"Don't be fooled this is not a book about true romance and soul healing.It's dark, brooding and love manifests in nothing more than primordial lust. There is nothing enchanting or mystical about the Horse Whisperer himself it just seems he's on a quest to get into Anne's pants. Whore whisperer is more like it. This book made me feel depressed like there was a dark cloud looming over me every page I read. Mindless,dark,and paticularly disturbing at some parts. The Horse was not as deranged as the back cover synopsis would suggest, making the character forgettable.I'd avoid this one, don't look the gift horse in the mouth."
3,Alrighty then..(with apologies to Jim Carrey),"I was jarred everytime I read the word ""alright."" I don't believe this spelling is acceptable so why was it allowed? It is alwrong. Although the ending is a bit contrived, the rest of the book is fairly predictable. The adulterous affair was only a matter of when not if. Too long, but readable enough for me to want to finish although the writing was pedestrian, needed a bit more Sidney Sheldon and a little less Nicolas Sparks and Robert Waller."
3,I think that something is missing.,"After all is said and done, I think that something is missing from within the story. I think the plot becomes trivialized with the conception of Annie's baby and the death of Tom.The book starts out strong and ends like a Danielle Steele novel (which is not a bad thing).However, I really am looking forward to the movie!"
3,Horse whisperer or just adulterers?,"Supposedly the story could be developed more profound, but the author turned a horse into a shitty miserable creature, and later disregarded it to poke around with shameful lust of the horse around hero and the horsy around heroine. What a shame! This is a talented writer but focused too much on shameless flesh and lust. Where is the horse whisperer? Well, he's just trying to whiper your pants off. A very ilogical development"
1,Bridges of Madison County on Horseback,"This was a really bad book - boring and predictable from beginning to end. Worst of all it was insulting to me as a woman. Evans obviously couldn't write a believable female character to save his life. Annie spends most of the book trying to salvage a relationship with her daughter and the rest of it abandoning her familial responsibilities and selfishly and recklessly pursuing an affair with the ""strong, sensitive, Montana cowboy"" (is this a Harlequin??) And in between she spends a great deal of time ""pleasuring herself."" Given the absurd dialogue of the characters and the melodramatic ramblings of the author, I actually found myself laughing more than anything else. Those poor horses.... to have to endure the company of such people."
1,Ludicrous!,What romantic tripe! It was a laborous narrative devoid of any surprises or much interest. I think the author should have created more believable characters.
2,Don't waste your money,"This book started out well ... not great literature by any means, but worthwhile summer time fluff reading. Then it totally fell apart with incredibly bad descriptions and a totally predictable, stupid ending that made me yell."
4,"if you love rozz williams, its a must.","this album is truley one of the most depressing albums i have ever heard! but it is also a great album. Rozz Williams and Gitane Demone are always a beautiful combination. this album i will recomend. this is a beautiful album made up of paino, Gitane's pretty vocals and rozz's sorrow filled voice. if you are a rozz williams fan, and you still feel Rozz Williams was ""Christian Death"" at their greatest! you need this album. this one is truely a uniuqe expierance in his shortend career. he gets really personal for example the song ""flowers""...a sad but true testimony of his life with herion. this album will suprise you, once again of his multi talents. a truely heart breaking album.and i love it. Rest In Peace, rozz williams."
3,Good but not my favorite,"I am a huge Maya fan but I felt that this was not her best stuff. I liked the poetry but it didn't compare to ""Still I Rise"" or ""Phenomenal Woman"". Again, I liked it because Maya doesn't write bad poetry but I wasn't as in love with this collection as I am with her other work."
3,doesn't protect scope much,"This type of case would be OK for a shotgun or an unscoped rifle, but since the scope sticks up it seems to get bumped around a lot."
4,Beef Jerky Time,I only have used this a few times but it worked fairly well for my limited needs. I froze a roast to cut for homemade jerky and found the motor struggling to slice through the meat. In fact it felt like I was going to break something. Anyway I gave up and waited for the meat to thaw and once in a semi frozen state the cutter cut awesome. Next day I cut up a room temp pork roast so I could make marinade Spicy Korean Pork and the cutter cut fine but the meat kept sticking to the blade and going round and round. It was very messy and even dangerous. Next time I’ll put the meat in the freezer for an hour or more to firm it up. BTW the tilt control is a must have feature. Also very easy to clean.
4,good slicer,"I never thought of owning a slicer until I was finally tired of thee limited sandwich meats we would buy, based on price and quality. After thinking about it and recently making pastrami and roast beefs we pulled the trigger on this.So far its been as advertised. I bought a 4lb bulk off deli quality turkey @ $4 lb versus $9 and sliced it just the way we like it. Divided it up over 2 weeks only slicing what will be eaten in 3-4 days for best results, because you notice texture and color change on the sliced stuff over time.Cheese already lasting much longer with thin uniform slices. I've done breads, frozen beef for jerky and its all turned out great.Cleanup can be done quickly once you get the hang of it, Clorox wipes come in handy for raw meat or tough to get places."
3,Good but not great,"I used the slicer to cut several types of vegetables (carrots, zucchini, etc) and some raw pork loin.#1 concern: the motor heated up more than I expected during my use. None of the the wonderful reviews addressed that point.#2 concern: I could not get the slicer to slice raw meat without leaving a ""tail"". Maybe more experience with the slicer will resolve the issue.#3 concern: I am not totally pleased with the speed at which the slicer cuts carrots & zucchini. I bought the machine thinking that it would help me spend less time in the kitchen. I don't think that will happen.#4 concern: the machine is not easy to clean after cutting bloody raw meat. It is important to disinfect the whole machine, but there are so many unreachable areas. I don't even know if I can immerse the entire blade in hot soapy water. The manufacturer should include more specific instructions.Chef's Choice 632 International Gourmet VariTilt Electric Food Slicer"
5,This is a great slicer!,"I wanted to replace my old slicer which was very difficult to clean. I checked all the reviews for the products that I found at many sites and this slicer was the one that seemed the most promising. When I received it, I checked to ensure that it would come apart, including the tray that holds the meat/cheese/veggie for slicing. This is exactly what I was looking for. I have sliced roasts, pepperoni and cheese on it so far and am delighted with the operation and the cleanup."
2,Sorry quality & attention to detail.,"I ordered two gun safes, HOBAT, 7-gun, for $79.95 each plus shipping. I ordered one for my son in Colorado, and one for my son in Pennsylvaina. Ref customer ID# 40121005, order number: 60120901, for my son Jim, in Colorado, but addressed to my son Bill. Customer ID# 40121004, order no. 60120900, for my son Bill, in Pennsylvania. The safe for Jim, arrived at his home, addressed to me, attention to detail is/was nonexistent. He tried to put the safe together, but the holes did not line up, thus he is sending it back, and I suppose you will ship him another safe. The safe that went to my son in Pennsylvania also had problems with the holes lining up, but he fixed the situation by drilling new holes that accommodated the screws.Sorry quality, and attention to detail, nothing more important then the customer's NAME, address, etc...good grief.I won't be returning."
4,"Great, easy to read book on the history of New Netherland.","This book is very easy to read, almost like a novel, yet, it contains highly detailed description of events that take place in 1602-1673.Book contains several maps, graphs, and charts to visually aid the reader.The major themes of the book are:- The West India Company- Territorial Commitment Establishment, 1623-1628- Anglo-Dutch Rivalry and Abandonment of the Company Monopoly- The People of New Netherland- New Netherland and the Amsterdam Merchants- Triumphs and Tragedies: New Netherland's Last Years.This is an excellent source of information for someone who wants to learn more about Dutch colonization of North America in the seventeenth century."
2,A Retread of a Brilliant Novel,"Pop. 1280 reads like a first draft of Thompson's brilliant The Killer Inside Me rather than a novel written twelve years later. Thompson wrote a tremendous number of novels during a very short period of time so it isn't surprising that some of them are misses and it's possible that Pop. 1280 was intended as a satirical take on his earlier novels -- though even read as satire the novel does not match the power of many of his ther novels.If you are new to Jim Thompson read The Killer Inside Me, The Grifters, or The Getaway first."
3,Funny and interesting...but not that great.,"I finished it about one week ago. The novel is quite interesting, since the main caracther is both plain and twisted, and it has three or four good turns. But I wouldn't rate it as the ""master of suspense"" that is been elected. Good book."
5,A personal and enlightening read,"Robert Kee's name should be recognizable by any avid reader of WWII POW stories, and I was delighted when I saw that he had written a book about his experiences.Starting with his being shot down and ending shortly after the camp is evacuated by the Nazis, Kee's work is a little more introspective than many of the other POW books. He concentrates less on the escaping and more on his feelings and impressions of what he saw and experienced. As such, his work gives the reader a new perspective, an excellent feel for what it was like to be a POW. He even details things that other books have tended to gloss over (and that I always wondered about): how bad the latrine really was, what it was like to live in such close proximity with others, and just how bad the lack of food was, to name a few.Anyone interested in WWII, war, or POW stories will enjoy this book. I believe that even casual readers will find it an enlightening read, and I fully recommend it to anyone."
2,Not that great,This sauce isn't that good for someone who really likes things hot. I eat Naga Jolokia sauce on a daily basis and this doesn't quite reach the same heat level and the taste is really bad in comparison. I'm not a fan of the extract flavor and I suggest trying a Naga Jolokia sauce if eating on an individual meal. I haven't tried this in a pot of food so maybe in that sense it works well but that's not what I use it for.
4,A little magic never hurt anyone,"I must say i enjoyed book 3 much more so then book 2. This was a fun tale from start to finish. In this story, Artemis decides to embark on one final criminal activity, which only entails taking down a large and notoriously bad IT mogul. During the process, everything that could go wrong does! And once again Artemis needs the help of the fairies. This book takes off with great speed and is much more adventurous then the previous book.I throughly enjoyed this book, it was a fun tale and i look forward to reading book 4. I think that if you have enjoyed the first 2 books then you will certainly enjoy this one. 4 stars for the excitement and drama in this book. Once again, i feel like a kid again everytime i read Colfer's books. He is a great author that grows with experience.Have fun reading this book."
5,They just get better and better!!,"He now has to get a machine back that is years ahead of his time but off a ruthless,crazed, maniac!!!A masterpiece!"
4,ARTEMIS FOWL the eternity code,"Artemis is back again. If you liked the first two artemis fowl books you will love this one.So one day Artemis makes this hi-tech computer called the C-CUBE. Well he wants to sell it to a mister Jon Spiro.Spiro steals the C-CUBE butler gets shot and all most dies.Holly comes and saves buttler.So Holly,Artemis and mulch diggums set off to get the C-Cume back.I would recomend this book."
5,The best series has come back for more!,"The Artemis Fowl series has been one of the most unanticapated book known to man kind. Its surprising twists in the storyline makes it more enjoyable and also surpasses most other books. Eoin Colfer has now created his third book... The Eternity cube! Artemis is on a new criminal scheme,even though his father is back and honest (his horror). Though in spite this he has stolen fairy technology to make the C cube which will render all other human technology useless. This bok will make Fowl fans rush to get this book. The most unanticipated series is back and better than before."
3,Fast read,"Like the previous two, this was a good, fast read. There isn't much detail, but the story does move along."
1,The eternity code,Not my type of book dealing with mythical characters .it was well written. Descriptions were well Developed.l would recommend this book.
4,Artemis Fowl The Eterenity Code,"Eion Colfer came out with his latest fantasy book, Artemis Fowl, Eternity Code the third book he made.In this book Artemis Fowl's father was held captive by Mafia for two years, and his father said that he should not commit any crimes. But, Artemis Fowl want to commit one more crime. He created a computer that can do fairy magic that was stolen with fairy technology fifty years before it was even made! It was called C cube. But a character named John Spiro made a trap, stole the computer, and killed a character named Butler. Artemis's, only hope is to make fairy magic for his friend Captain Holly of the fairy police.In conclusion, this book is very good for ages 10-13. I myself liked the book and all the other books named The Artic Incident and Artemis Fowl, because it is so amazing with all these cool things. It is a good book."
5,Great!,"I originally was skeptical about reading this series because I heard that it was a mixture of fantasy and science fiction, and those aren't my favorite genres. However,when my sister brought it back from the library I decided to try it. I literally couldn't put it down! The story was well written, it was very funny, and it was much better than the average dime-a-dozen fantasy or science fiction novel. I haven't yet read the first two but I will shortly hopefully, along with the later ones too, of course! I wholeheartedly give this book five stars. My only regret is that I didn't read Artemis Fowl and The Arctic Incident first."
2,Hard To Follow,"I really didn't like this book. I read it two years ago and I thought it was really hard to follow. This book has too many things going on. Its really hard to follow and boring, I stopped reading this book. I would not recommend this book."
2,Watchable but not especially good,"This movie was just ok. On one hand, the production values are quite high especially relative to what I expected. The cast also isn't half bad, and it's a bit fun to see the little girl from one of the latter Halloween movies (part 5?) all grown up. So with the production and the cast, it's good enough to watch and you won't necessarily regret having done so.On the other hand, the story isn't that good. From nearly the first five minutes, the entire movie is completely predictable so don't expect any surprises. It's also not particularly effective; the pacing is slow and the conflict moments lack impact.If you're looking at this for Tiffany Shepis, know she has a very limited role as a mother figure, not the role she typically plays and which has earned her some measure of fame.Recommended as a rental."
2,Too simply and outdated patterns,"Would not recommend unless you are just starting, but even then, the stuff in this book is so not fashionable....waste of money to me."
5,Smells amazing!,"It really makes my dog smell amazing, even after many days after bathing him. It has also helped him shedding less since it's good for his skin."
4,hilarious,"I didn't start watching this show till January of 2006, so I'm glad I got this DVD set to catch up on it. I think the episodes are absolutely hilarous, with the odd-couple mismatch of Charlie and Alan and their adventures with Jake. The comedy is impressive in this collection. The actors really work well together."
2,Two and a half Men,"Two and a Half Men - The Complete First Seasonthe first 2 discs were ok th third disc kept hesitating and was very upsetting to try to see, haven not seen the 4th disc yet but if it does the same thing I will want it replaced I would like to have the disc 3 replaced anyway."
1,It makes me sick.,"The one star is not for the series, 'cause it's tops. The one star is for the way the company treats its customers. I'm not crawling on my hands and knees begging them to take my money. As long as we keep crawling they can treat us like that. I have a suggestion where they can stick their stuff..."
4,"Not Classic, But Close","""Gordon"", the first album from the Canadian Barenaked Ladies, still holds up as their best to date. Songs like ""Be My Yoko Ono"" showcase the Ladies' fantastic perfect harmonies. Gordon also contains the first studio recordings of a large number of old favorites. Every BNL fan has favorites from this album; it's a classic. It also features some of BNL's darker songs (""The Flag"" and ""Crazy"" for example), which really stand out as little gems of beautiful harmony and songwriting. Every song on this album has its separate and unique qualities, but bound together the way they are on this debut album is truly classic. The Ladies have followed up with some fantastic music, but none have been so great as Gordon."
3,Where's the Music?,"I've read and heard countless reviews raving about this CD, but I'm finding it disappointing. Yes, David Gray is a wonderful songwriter. His lyrics are unique and meaningful. But why the preprogrammed techno music? Some bass and drums from some live musicians will really make this a top choice for me, but I can't seem to get past the fact that I could duplicate the music with my own equipment."
5,Buy this now,"Great album...mix of acoustic guitar and drum machine...may not sound like a match made in heaven, but I have to tell you it is well worth the price. Bought the album off at David Gray's web site some months ago and have been telling friends ever since. Nice to see it is easily available here."
5,Hooked,"..and captivated. Not only to the music itself but by the lyrics this artists has delivered. I'd heard the song 'This Year's Love' from the movie Crazy/Beautiful and thought of it fittingly cool to listen to. David Gray has an edgy and hip modern folk music that new listeners can explore to, and this album has really cool songs like ""Babylon"", ""Say Hello, Wave Goodbye"", and the beautiful ""This Year's Love""."
5,A Great CD,"I bought this CD because I was considering going to a David Gray concert in Seattle, and had never heard any of his music. I loved the CD, but then found out that the concert had been sold out for months. It's a wonderful CD, and has a thoughtful Cat Stevens/James Taylor kind of quality to it. It's the best CD I've bought in years, and I recommend it very highly."
4,Good stuff,"I bought this album after seeing David perform Babylon on Conan O'Brien. I'm a little disappointed by the techno-synthesized sampling, instead of the straight acoustic guitar used for the live performance. But it's still gets high marks for some overall great song-writing. It's not going to make me forget Dave Matthews Band (in fact I don't think the comparison is all that good of one, more of an early Dylan (not that I'm much of a Dylan fan)), but I love it for its differences."
4,GREAT,"The David Gray cd was great, but his voice was not that good. He plays the guitar at a 5, but his voice brings him down to a 4. Buy this album but ignore his voice. A-"
3,"Good design, very bassy","I had purchased the Altec Lansing inMotion iM5 from Amazon for $50 a while back but between the intermittent popping sound between tracks and tinny sound, I decided to get another dock/speakers and chose the Klipsch iGroove SXT based on Klipsch's reputation and the unit's reviews on Amazon. The iGroove SXT sounds much more warm and deep but lacks highs but it's still an improvement over the iM5. Great design (I prefer black to the white of the iM5)that allows the sound to be more widely dispersed than the iM5. The iGroove SXT does not have video composite out or subwoofer out (which it doesn't need anyway) like the iM5. I never use the unit's remote.Since I'm still not completely happy with the sound, I'm wondering if I should have just bitten the bullet and bought the B&W; Zeppelin, but I haven't had the opportunity to listen to one to see if the $600 price is justified."
3,DOA in a year and a half,"Well...it worked great and sounded great too...but 18 mos later, it wont charge the iPod and the sound is completely distorted with no volume control. Now I have to get another one for my wife's office and wont be a Klipch. Kind of expensive to poop out so soon."
3,Klipsch iGroove SXT iPod Sound System Speakers,"The sound on this speaker is great and can be set pretty loud when it is used for a party or lower if you wish. The only thing that i did not know about this product was that it does not charge my iPod while it is playing, and that was dissapointing. But the sound is so great that i kept the speaker, and the size is great for taking to parties and is not cumbersome. Klipsch speakers are always great. gigi"
5,Great Buy!,"After 5 minutes of searching for IPod docks, I was sold. This not only exceeds functional expectations and destroys the usual skepticism, it looks good. I love it. The price was much less than what I'd be willing to pay for a product of this quality. The only issue I have(and it's probably easy to resolve) sometimes I have to turn the power off and back on or the IPod pauses playback to let me know it's charged. After I do that, I have no further interuptions. This Box Rocks!"
1,Another dead and gone,I was loving the Klipsch groove for 13 months until today. Sound died this morning and now all I have is a rather large ipod charger!
1,60 Days & Unit is Completely DEAD!,"I purchased this unit from BestBuy the first week of May. Now it's the first week of July & I came home to find the unit unresponsive - will not power on.I HAD been using it without issue with my iPod Touch 2 Gen. It played beautifully & charged the iPod with no problems whatsoever!! I loved that little system!I usually dock my iPod at night & play quiet music while I sleep, then undock & take the iPod to work with me for a full day of listening to music. Never had an issue in 2 months & now suddenly the unit is completely dead. I paid $170 for this system & for it to be dead after 2 months is simply unacceptable!!Will be returning to BestBuy since they are supposed to honor the manufacturer's warranty. We will see how it goes. I'm sure they will just hand me a new one which will also die in less than 6 months."
4,Spanish magazine made for Spanish Foreign Language students,"An up to date, magazine with written articles and full CD recordings of the same articles. A great tool for HS and college Spanish Language professionals. I picked up a sample copy at NECTFL Conference in New York and just recently started using this CD with my High School Spanish students. I'm excited about getting a subscription to keep my classes up to date on the lastest in Spanish culture and current events."
3,Not so hot,"When reading reviews for this product I was under the impression it would be tongue frying hot,but after receiving and trying on various foods I came to the realization it was over hyped in reviews. I was greatly disappointed,I was hoping for something hot but this just didn't fit the bill or justify the cost. Dave's Ultimate Insanity is no hotter than Dave's insanity sauce. Da bomb at 135000 scoville blows this stuff out of the water in heat and taste. I will try some others and see where my comfort level is. Dave's is disappointing!Also,this is the first time I ever ordered something from Amazon that wasn't broken when received."
1,"This is what passes for sharp, sophisticated humor?","I managed about 5 pages before the incessant, whiney, self-rightous ranting made me put it down. This isn't a particularly funny book. If you liked Miller on SNL, you'd probably like this book. Of course, you'd probably also like watching car wrecks."
4,An Excellent Follow-Up,"To anyone who read the first book of rants, this book is more of the same. To anyone who hasn't...what are you waiting for?Miller once again proves why he is in a league of few peers. This collection of insights on pertinent social topics is at times funny, at times hilarious, and always thought provoking. I can't agree with everything he has to say but I do respect his points of view, mostly because of the fair, rational way he gets his point across. The only problem I have with it is I sometimes had to go searching for info on the obscure references he mentions!A highly enjoyable and unfortumately all too quick read."
2,"Dissapointed, but with decent content","I was excited when i got this book, but dissapointed when I opened it. I purchased this book to find a tennis workout program and what i found was a bunch of pictures describing various exercises. I could have got this information online in dozens of different websites. I found no information new and i still have to create a fitness program for myself. All this book has is a bunch of scattered information, the authors should have tied it all together with a comprehensive fitness program at the end, which would have made this book great. This book is ok at best."
3,Babyhood isn't just about babies.,"What's so wierd about this book is that you can relate it to anything in your life. I mean, who hasn't said to someone, ""You're such a baby"" or ""Don't be such a baby."" Babyhood really teaches you, in a down to earth way, people skills. I read it in a Learning Annex class on Communicating with Comedy and found it to be truly eye-opening. Someday I'll remember where I learned how to let it all go and just ""be a big baby!"" I could only give it three stars though because I deducted one because I would like more pictures and number two I would like a sequel!"
4,An fun read,"Okay. We liked the book, we also liked the show. And unlike the Seinfeld book, it is not just a rehash of the show. Although it may not prepare you for the real thing, the book should set off a few alarm bells if you are considering starting your family. An enjoyable read."
