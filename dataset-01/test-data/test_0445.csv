1,Disappointed,"I wanted a black decorative tension rod. Well. This isn't it.It was not advertised as a twist and turn rod. Maybe I should have known that from the picture. Anyway, it does not stay up on a smooth painted surface. My curtains are extremely light. Yet, the minute I twisted this thing on, and hung the curtains, it immediately untwisted itself and fell to the floor. It took with it some of the paint from my wall.It is also cheap looking. Now I have to go through the inconvenience and expense of returning it. Not to mention having to spot paint my wall."
3,Not as thick as it looks...,The photo makes it look a lot thicker than what it actually is. So far is doing a decent job of holding up a long curtain. It is a good solution if you live in a rental and do not want to drill any holes. Recommended.
2,"Flimsy, Too Thin, Lasted Only 10 Months","The photo of this shower curtain rod looks nice. My shower is only 58"" wide, and this rod barely works. 10 months later, it was warped and rusted and needed to be replaced. The rod is only 1/2"" diameter at the THICK end, 3/8"" diameter at the thin end. Not thick enough to support most standard shower curtains. You need a thicker rod (1"" diameter) than this one."
4,Fastest download product for your CF's.,I have other devices including the Delkin 32 bit PCMCIA card. This device is faster for my 4GB CF cards full of RAW files.I worry a little about the rotating USB connector. Over time this could be a point of failure. But for the past two months I have enjoyed the extra fast downloads.
2,I wish i could say i got what i paid for....,"I got this item about 4 days ago, and i am really disappointed.the only word that can describe this is CHEAP. The fabric feels like plastic and it is really unpleasant and itch. The comforter is unbearable. You only get a sham, comforter a set of really cheap sheets and 2 pillow cases( no throw pillows like in the picture). It looks nice but is not something you can sleep with. Yes its only 60$ but you can go to marshals or Ross and get something much better.But the seller Homevisions has amazing customer service that excepted my return without a problem and even payed for the shipping back."
5,Mad About You soundtrack,Recommended for the people who liked mad about you and was sorry to see it go off the air......songs and dialogue are great...
5,Where did this lady com from? She's marvelous!,"I had never heard of Linda Eder until my fiance recommended her and gave me her CD for Christmas. I am her newest and biggest fan. My fiance and I especially love the song from Jekyll and Hyde, ""Someone Like You"". It's become our theme song. Thanks, Linda....move over Barbra!"
5,Why the hesitation?,"I had never heard of Linda till a friend bought me ""My Favorite Broadway The Leading Ladies"" CD for Christmas last year. WOW.Barbra? Celine? Audra? They can't hold a candle to this powerful singer. After buying this CD, you'll take one listen to ""Man of la Mancha"" and be blown away! Then you'll check out the other *fifteen* songs and wonder where they've been hiding this treasure! After getting over the shock of listening to the entire CD, you'll order her new ""It's No Secret Anymore"" and go thru the process all over again.WARNING: listening to this CD is highly addictive and may disrupt your other listening habits (it hasn't left my CD player in 4 months! )"
3,(Wo)Man of La Mancha,"Cruising through the first few tracks gives you a most pleasant feeling. LE is a highly qualified Streisandress and the material is efficient in respectable broadway tradition. Good diversity - some brassy here, some piquant there. Nice tunes and some playful lyrics. Solid three-star stuff. Then, almost halfway through, boom - ""Man of La Mancha (I, Don Quixote)."" A true ""must hear"" experience - force-of-nature vocal acting with a supernaturally stratospheric sound during the break. Now we're well into five star territory. Sadly, I must punish the ""Children of Eve"" with a two-star deduction - although it's always fun when you happen upon such a rich compendium of clich√©s, including children's chorus, pennywhistle, and a coda sung by a nine-year-old."
1,Avoid them,"Bose sound is highly overrated to start with. But when these speakers failed 3 times in < 1 year, I gave up and switched to M-Audio. Don't waste your money."
3,Not for freezing,"These cannisters are good for keeping attractive dry goods on the shelf, but they are not for home canning use because the gaskets won't last. Just a word to the wise."
2,Nothing much new,"There's not a lot new here that hasn't been around in previous WW2 in color DVDs released over the past few years. The best piece, which is actually an extra and is five minutes long, covers the pathfinder airbourne troops. Otherwise, this is very average. Note also that the length of this DVD, including all extras, is about 80 minutes, with the main program about 48 minutes."
4,D-Day in color,Terrific documentary footage! Makes you feel like you are watching the events today on CNN.
2,Allen's Book Boring,"I have listened to Fred Allen when he was on the air. I thouht he and his characters were very funny. With the exception of some of the old scripts,I found the book boring. It was a struggle to finish it"
1,What Happened To Ingersoll- Rand???,"I'll have to agree with the previous poor review of this grinder. This is just another example of CHINESE CRAP! Right out of the box it sounds like all of the internal parts are misaligned or the bearings were destroyed when it was assembled. This grinder will be returned ASAP. I have lots of IR tools in my shop and have always been satisfied until now, however those tools were made in America. I'm sure I'm not alone on this one. Don't waste your cash on this tool. ARE YOU LISTENING INGRERSOLL-RAND??? You are losing your customers!"
3,Sid and Nancy= Love Kills,"Though iam not a fan of the movie considering the lies it holds i enjoy this cd alot. It's just good quality music, a bit of romance as well. I especially enjoyed Joe Strummer's songs (of course i would since he's from the Clash). My two favorite songs on it though are ""Haunted"" by the Pogues & ""Love Kills"" by the Circle Jerks. i wouldn't recommend this if u are a Punk & are weirded out by different types of music but if u're open to other types of music buy Sid and Nancy."
2,"Come on, Lynda. This book is full of sloppy mistakes.","This book would deserve five stars if it weren't for MANY sloppy, but substantive, errors in both the text and in the graphics. Unlike typos, these errors affect the content. For example, several graphics are flipped, resulting in incorrect and confusing captions under graphics which are used as examples. If I weren't an experienced web designer, I might not have noticed. Beginners could have a difficult time replicating some of the techniques discussed. So, Lynda, you need to spend MORE time proofing a book that you're going to sell... I turn to Lynda's books again and again, so this carelessness is a big disappointment."
4,Good one,"I like this one, not at the top of my list, but it did have some songs I really liked. You can't go wrong with Sandro very often if you are a true fan."
4,EuroHorror with zombies,I just recieved and viewed the Blind Dead collection. the films are a must for fans of Eurohorror-sleaze films.You get all 4 movies of the Knights who come back and kill everyone.I enjoy them. They are cheaply made but a good nights entertainment. They are perfect examples of 70's film making in Europe. They don't do it like this anymore. Which is good and bad.If you like Zombies this is right up your alley.I recommend this set at anyone into film making and any horror fan.You will enjoy!
2,Way over-rated.,"I read so much about how ""creepy"" these Holy Grail of movies were. Luckily, I did not buy the set. I rented it from a local store in Philadelphia. I suggest renting them before making a purchase. I thought these movies were extremely dull, and not in the least frightening. Tombs is the best of the four movies. But, it is really all downhill to the end. Unless you're a Blind Dead fanboy, save your money."
1,shoddy manufacturing,"This CD case would be tolerable, except for one thing... Absolutely no quality control on the product. The one I ordered had several loose pages when it came out of the box -- not torn, just never attached to the binding and laid in the folder loose -- and many of the others are not attached well. I have bought knockoff brandless CD wallets from junk sales and/or flea markets that were better made and cost half as much. I am very disappointed and will never buy a Laserline product again!"
1,Doesn't pick up all the dirt,"I bought two of these. Doesn't make good contact with the ground, so it doesn't pick up all the dirt. It is also awkward to hang."
4,Great for apartment use,Love the connection b/w the broom and the dust pan. I never lose them! great for apartment living and picking up behind my swifer wet jet
5,Terrific Read; Great Addition to Series!,"This book is about 17 year-old Biddy who is equipment manager for the Birmingham Barons, one of the greatest teams in the Negro Leagues! Although he does not get to play much, the experience for Biddy is amazing. Biddy encounters much prejudice during the season, and even some games are segregated! He also gets to play alongside some of the world's greatest players, including one who would be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, Willie Mays! Find out all about Biddy Owens and his trip to the Negroe Leagues World Series in this awesome book!"
4,An educational book!,"If you like history and baseball this is a must read.It tells alot about black baseball players such as Larry Doby,Willy Mayes&Jackie Robinson.The book gives great detail about how black people were treated in 1948.Awsome descriptions of the games.And a good history book.This is a must read book!"
3,Good but no Les Mis!,"I bought this and listened to it once and haven't listened to it since. I enjoyed it and the music was good and the story was easy to follow but I just didn't feel the need to revisit it. Maybe it would be different it I had seen the play. However, I've never seen Les Miserables and I've listened to the cast recording many times. I was hoping this would open some new doors for me in that arena. If you want something similar to Les Mis - Miss Saigon is a nice one - kind of similar - although still not Les Mis! But RENT... that is another phenomenal show to listen to. At any rate, Jekyll and Hyde is interesting to listen to once - but probably better in person."
3,Not as good as 1994 Concept Production,"OK, I got this one just for the sake of the new songs in it.The first piece is nice, but, oh well, everyone should understand the but.It's not the vocalist problem, but more into the song editing issues.I hate they change the name into Emma, I don't care what's the reason behind it, it is just ""wrong"".I recommend the 1994 concept case production with full scores if you are interested in because even the live show can't make it that well."
2,Jekyll and Hyde,Jekyll and Hyde has a few nice moments but it's not all that great. I enjoyed the cd with Anthony Warlow a lot more than this one. Linda Eder does as well as she can vocally though I don't think her acting skills are quite as strong as they need to be. The rest of the cast is not bad considering the material.
3,Worth it for This is the Moment,"Attended the 5th performance of Jekyll & Hyde on Broadway, when they still had kinks to get out. Linda Eder had throat problems and her songs were sung by an understudy offstage. During the first song Robert Cuccioli sang I thought I was in for a long night. By the end of the first act I was running out to the lobby to see if the soundtrack was available. I had to wait 3 months before the original soundtrack from broadway was available. Not having heard any other versions I thoroughly enjoy this one. (If you're a soundtrack buff and buy them without see the shows, the songs of Emma and Lucy might confuse you as they sound very similar in some songs.) Otherwise, it's great being able to relive the play everytime I hear the music."
2,Not for me,"Nicely done, but not what I expected. I bought it because I saw Terry Pratchett's name. Great thought I, because I love Terry Pratchett books, and thought it would be something along those lines. But a Terry Pratchett book it is definitely not. Far from it. That's not to say other people wouldn't enjoy it, but not me. I would call it a coffee table book - one you toss on your coffee table for other people to thumb thru, but you never read yourself. It's one of those books that if I had seen it in a bookstore, then thumbed thru it, I never would have bought it."
3,"C√≥modas al principio, pero...","Al principio fueron las mejores botas del mundo, sin embargo, despu√©s de 3 meses de uso not√© que, a pesar de tener un taco bajo, y ser de calce perfecto, sumado a excelente material, el exceso de flexibilidad de la planta o suela, le juega en contra y termina provocando una consecuente,flexi√≥n excesiva del pie; es decir, le falla el soporte plantar, que es d√©bil...por lo que las dej√© de usar."
2,one star for each song,"Tori appears on the cover in her ""unlock the silence"" shirt. The live track is from the ""Live in NY"" concert video (VHS), which is an excellent concert! This CD isn't really that exciting, but it is nice to have a ""silent all these years"" single on the shelf."
3,"Interesting, considering...","the vast majority of these stellar reviews are written by reviewers who haven't bothered to review another book on Amazon. Then again, maybe they have writer's block. I'm not against anything that gets people in the creative mindset, so I wouldn't say this book is bad by any means, but I wouldn't necessarily join the 5-star bandwagon occurring here."
3,"Turn it up, sonny.","I purchased this Hybrid SACD because I wanted a recent surround-sound recording of the Moonlight Sonata. The biggest problem I have with this recording is that is was mastered at a very low level. I know that classical recordings often do this so allow room for loud passages to be really loud, but seriously they could have boosted this recording by 12dB.Decent performances, but I find Kempf's pedal-starts to be unappealing. I might try to get the Hybrid SACD Rubenstein recording from the old RCA Living Stereo series (early 1960s) as a comparison."
5,A book for savvy christians,"This is the one of the most comforting book I've ever read in my life. I found out more about Spiritual life and God's promises through Jesus. It's a real step ahead of our time, and very clarifying book for the ones who are really serious about spiritual evolution. You will not be able to stop reading this book!"
1,Mindless self serving drivel,"Ok, where do I begin? The so called answers to these questions are so arrogant in their assumptions, so full of twisted and distorted logic, so ignorant of the scientific principles governing the formation of intelligent and higher level biological creatures, so offensive, that I can only laugh at the ridiculous notion this book was dictated but some higher beings instead of being the mere contorted mental concoctions of the author himself.Don't waste your time reading this drivel, it's the antidote and an insult to critical thinking!"
5,"Five stars for ""Beastly Things""","This collection of Non Sequitur cartoons is amazing. I expected a smaller collection, but this one was massive. A whopping 256 pages of Non Sequitur comics. The book is very well done and it shows the hard work Wiley obviously put into it.If you are a ""Non Sequitur"" fan, do yourself a favor and buy this book. It's very cool.-Stacy Curtis."
3,Does he deserve another chance?,Why would his daughter have such a problem with him? Or is she just dysfunctional enough to drag him across the ocean to drop a bomb on him? That issue distracts from a pleasant story about two people trying to get by late in the game.
3,Delightful adult romantic comedy,Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson are wonderful in this realistic adult romatic comedy set in London. Lovely photography. One of Hoffman's best performances in recent years. This is a heartwarming story of two lonely people trying to find a little happiness before it's too late. More realistic than fantasy.
4,A delightful romantic comedy,"A delightful romantic comedy -- especially for viewers of a certain age. Joel Hopkins wrote the screenplay as a vehicle for Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson. What a brilliant idea! Okay, so it's not Casablanca. But the charisma and screen chemistry make this movie shine."
3,Mona Lisa,"I love the story, but the Movie moved too slow. I found myself getting bored at times with the pace of the movie. Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson are two of my favorite Actors and I would probally watch any Movie they perform in. I aslo usually love love stories with more mature actors. Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson were great, but I would not call this a Classic, becouse I think people will forget it after time."
1,Misleading CD,"As the other reviewers have stated, you get an actual copy of ""Whoever's in New England"" and ""Sweet 16"". I didn't read the reviews first and therefore didn't realize the ruse until I received the product! If you're really jonesed to get those two CD's then it's a good deal, but get it ""used""...much cheaper. I paid .65 each...as the old saying goes, ""if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is."" As was the case here."
1,Plastic Tabs strip too easily,"The first time you use the tray, it seems to work great - until the tray is pulled off. The tabs that 'lock' the tray onto the front piece strip out way too easily and the tray is pretty useless at that point. They need to have a better design to lock the tray into place.In other words, a total waste of money. The entire purpose was to have a surface to place toys and other things on, but when the tray keeps falling off, you may as well just place your items in baby's lap."
5,My son loves it,"This is a great addition to the bumbo chair. My son could not reach toys while sitting in it. This fits the chair perfectly, and I can stick the little suction cup baby toys to it and he plays for a long time. His sitting up skills have improved alot. He can sit up on the ground by himself now, but he still likes to sit in the chair when he eats."
2,6 month old daughter in less than 2 weeks,"It's a great idea, but poorly designed. I found it awkward to put on, so I rarely used it. However, when I made a concerted effort to use it, my daughter was able to pull up on the tray and snapped it off within two weeks. Don't waste your money."
2,A Frustrating Design,"I was excited to get my tray. However, after I snapped it together, I realized it doesn't go onto the Bumbo easily. If you slide the top part over the middle hump, then you can't get the bottom part underneath the Bumbo to lock it in place. And you have to take the tray off to get your baby out. So you have this struggle to get the tray on and off every time.Once you get the bottom part underneath the Bumbo, it will stay in place and work well. However, be prepared for the frustration of getting it on and off."
4,Makes baby sit in Bumbo longer,"My baby really liked his Bumbo starting at 3 mos, but now that he's closer to 5 he is starting to get bored in it. We purchased this tray so he could have toys and not drop them as much. It is pretty easy to get on, though with my chunky baby it is sometimes hard to get it under the seat just right when he's seated (17lbs). He does pull the tray off, but I just read a few reviews here that mentioned it has to snap. I thought I was pushing hard enough on it, but evidently maybe I'm not so I'll go back and check. Overall it has made his Bumbo a more versatile playspot, and for the price it is a good purchase.***Edit***So I snapped the two parts of the tray together. However, I find it still difficult to get the tray on with baby in the seat. You have to tip the seat to get the bottom flange underneath, which doesn't seem very safe, nor is it easy (my baby is 17lbs). It is then very stable, but kind of cumbersome to do."
5,Who needs a high chair?,This tray turns your Bumbo seat into a great place for baby to eat. I have a full size high chair I got as a baby shower gift but most of the time baby just eats in her Bumbo. It's also great when your traveling if you have a space saving high chair seat .
2,Hmmmm,I will admit that I haven't finished this book but I'm not a fan. I was really looking for a book to assist us as our family expands and I was very disappointed about how old/out-of-date this book is. I guess it's a lesson to me to really look at the book info before I purchase.
2,Mindless,"Do you like mindless movies with no plot nor story?....do you like mindless movies with topless dancers?...then this movie is for you then. Its not for everybody and this movie is hard to put into words, but, not worth buying...renting maybe..but, thats pushing it."
5,Great TV for the price.,I bought this tv at best buy about a month ago for $800 it is on clearance. I went into the store planning on purchasing a panasonic 42 plasma and saw this model sitting on the shelf. I saved $400 picking this up. Looks awesome in my living room. excellent quality picture and sound. my friends love coming over to watch sports.
1,Tablature is toys,It is a great book but NOT the tablature.To the one who translate the notes into tablature : Guitar has 6 strings but not ONLY ONE string.
2,Not Very Inspirational,"There aren't many other DVDs that teach slow movement (a DVD called ""Sensual Bellydance"" by the same company for example)but I've had a couple. And compared to those others, this is boring--very. There simply weren't many sequences to learn that made you feel like you'd accomplished something.I bought this DVD almost a year ago and it's taken me a long time to just get through it. By the same token, it IS long. It's over 2 hours. There are sections of it that ARE good. In particular I liked the way she described and demonstrated different rhythms...but I'd still pass on this one in favor of ""Sensual Bellydance"""
2,Lacking in basic words,"I purchased this dictionary for my then 2nd grader, based on the reviews, so she could have a resource for looking up words on her spelling lists as well as words she didn't know in her reading. While it is visually appealing, the very first word my daughter looked up was not there, nor was the 3rd word. After about 3 months of attempting to use this, it became apparent that the majority of words she needed to look up were not here. I would suggest looking elsewhere."
5,We use it almost every day,"I love this dictionary. Our kids are young and we use it almost every day. Sometimes, the older kids (9 & 7 years old) just get it out and read it. The pictures and captions are fun and interesting. Merriam-Webster has been in the dictionary business for like 200 years, so it's not really surprising that they know what their doing."
4,Great Dictionary for Kids,I bought htis for my 7 year old son and he just loves this dictionary. It gives very nice picture illustrations and good descriptions of the word meaning.I am giving it 4 stars because this is the only dictionary I have bought and there may be something out there which might deserv 5 stars.
2,there were writings on some of the pages,there were hand written notes as well as drawings on some of the pages. i don't think it was in good condition at all
3,"Pictures are great, but vocabulary content lacking","This dictionary is very kid-friendly; colored markers on the pages make it easy to find the letter you want to look up and the pictures are extensive and intriguing. However, in using this dictionary with K-6th grade students, I have found that it is lacking many words above a 4th grade level, and I have had to revert back to the good ol' Oxford English Dictionary many a time. If you are looking for a dictionary for grades 1-4 this one is great."
2,VERY SMALL!!,"I should have read all the reviews. The person that said this was perfect for a 6 month old was correct. The cross is EXTREMELY SMALL and the chain is really thin. I purchased this for a 10 year old, so I am returning it."
3,Nice,"this is a nice little cross, the chains were cheap and I replaced them, but the cross's were very nice"
1,Very Dissapointed,"Got it, opened it, the chain broke as soon as I picked it up. The chain is so thin, it looked like the thinnist fishing line you could get. The cross itself isn't much better as far as being fragile. You would think jewelry design (advertised) specifically for a child would have some strength to it. Not this pendant."
3,Lyddie the dreamer,"Liddie is a hafta read book about a teenage girl who has adream,and that dream is to save the farm so that her and her famalycan stay together.And in order to do this Lyddie must pay the depts to the farm by working in a mill,a dangerous job that requires much skill and awarness of what you are doing.In the book ""Lyddie"" Lyddie must struggle between right and wrong and win the battle going on inside of her.Lyddie must struggle with her emotions and stare down the looms like she did at her farm when she encountered a bear. END"
2,humbug,The book naturally focuses on 'deconstruction' - a nebulouscollage that has been rejected even by philosophers - whichshould clue the public in to how soft the subject really is.Additionally there are production flaws (dark shading in theillustrations obscuring the text) to vex the weary reader.
1,rating bubble gum,I was not pleased at all with this product. It took to long to get here and when it did the hard shell on the gum was broken on most of them my guess would be from the way it was packaged. I think a better description would be better thought they were bigger gum balls. Wouldn't recommend this product.
3,JUST GUMBALLS NO MORE TO SAY,Good product nice price nice size as well.Recommended for that price is ok!It work for me just fineJUST GUMBALLS
5,Digging it with a shovel,My amzing husband got me a gumball machine for Christmas and in it I poured these Double Bubble Bubble Gum balls and they are FABULOUS!! I recommend them highly
5,GREAT WATCH!,Unbelievable Watch! I have them in both brown and black straps. I get at least one comment per day on how cool and nice my watch is!This watch will be on my wrist for a long time to come.
2,Short on adequate protection,"The only issue I have with this product compared to similar products I've owned is that the that the location of the 'cup pocket' leaves one somewhat exposed and vulnerable where one should be more fully protected. Although I've tried different shaped cups, the cup pocket limits the protection a cup should provide. Since such protection is a critical consideration for this type garment, I personally would not buy this model again nor would I recommend it to others unless use of a cup is not necessary."
5,Excellent for 2004 Accord,"Replaced rotors (Centric) and pads (Akebono) at the same time, and it's like stopping on glass. Incredibly smooth and I feel like I can stop as fast as I want."
2,a.m.,The other reviewrs must see something that I don't see. The photos are pretty much average. They lack style and imagination. Spend your money on somethig better.
2,For Fans Only,"If you like Stallone at his taciturn and violent best, this may be for you. Anyone else should take a pass. The body count in Cobra alone makes many war movies take a back seat. However, he drives a really neat car and Brigitte Nielsen has legs to die for. With Tango & Cash, you get Jack Palance hamming it up as the bad-guy kingpin and Teri Hatcher for eye candy, but the story is so fanciful that one wonders if this is a spoof or just a really bad plot."
3,"Not much of a movie, but COBRA has some nice toys","This entire movie can be boiled down to: violent cop chases crazy murderer and lots of people get shot. Typical junk that came out of Hollywood in the 80-90's. Fun movies to watch because of the action and neat toys, but so detached from reality they are like cartoons with real people.Stallone has a really cool car that gets destroyed during the show. Too bad, because that car was the main highlight of the movie for me.He walks around with a 1911 stuffed in his pants at 12 o'clock. Stupid way to carry a sidearm because it's in full view and is pointing at something he would probably like to keep.Movies like this contributed to the negative perceptions that many people have of firearms and police. In the real world, they don't work like in this, and those who serve the public don't act like this.Fun to watch."
1,One of the worst movies I ever seen,"I didn't even get through half the movie before I turned it off. It was boring, poor quality, cheesy, and the acting sucked. I was so fustrated with the movie, I sold it on ebay the next day. I am a HUGE Stallone fan and I couldn't believe this movie was such a disapointment."
1,POS Movie,"This movie looks like a wedding gift from Sylvester Stallone to Brigette Nelson. Cheap sexual inneundos and teaches kids that beating up someone, or tearing his shirt is the heroic thing to do!"
4,All-time King of Bad Action Films,"Cobra makes Rambo 3 look realistic and intellectually appealing.A giant cult of insane axe-murders (not as cool as it sounds; remeber this is bad action not bad horror) takes on Stallone.Guess who wins.This film is pumped full of testosterone-fueled corniness, and seeps with pointless violence. If you laugh harder whenever Sly tries to be more serious, then get this, or at least rent it.In my opinion, Cobra is a laugh riot!P.S. There is one frightening thing about it however: Brian Thompson, an underrated character actor who is scary as hell itself."
1,All about Joan,"After having read other books on women's running, I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately my hopes were quickly diminished. This book seemed to be all about Joan and what she did to become an olympic champion. This may be good autobiographical material but as a guide to starting a running program this book flounders. Not many people starting out are capable of having knee surgery and running a race shortly thereafter. What little useful information was provided seemed impractical and laden with disclaimers such as, just because Joan did this doesn't mean that everyone can, etc. I wanted to read a book that would give me pointers in starting and maintaining a running program, not Joan's life story."
3,"Beautiful art, so-so address book","I really like the old style of the artwork in this book from the 1920's. The address book fuctionality of the book is limited though. There is very little room for each entry - just enough for the name, street, city/state, and telephone. There is a nice full page color print for each tabbed letter section (22). The book gives you three pages (of ten entries per page) for most letters (PQ are doubled up, UV are doubled up, and XYZ are put together).While I prefer more room for each entry (space for email address, birthday, children's names), I still enjoy this book for its fun, innocent fairies. Book size is about 7.5 inches tall by 6 inches wide; about .5 inch thick."
1,Poor quality - bent in less than a month,"We bought four of these to go with the Waddell Mfg Co 2508 Round Legs, to replace the stock legs on our Ikea Karlstad couch. After about two weeks, I noticed the front leg was bending to the side. I'd been meaning to get my husband to look at it, and this past weekend while we were sitting on the couch, it broke! Everything was installed properly, but the leg bent out the metal in the mounting plate. One leg actually broke, but two additional ones were about to break.I do NOT recommend this product for couch legs. Maybe a coffee table that you don't put any weight on or something. I am really disappointed. And for what its worth, we are pretty slim people, so it wasn't like we put an inappropriate amount of weight on the couch."
4,very nice,The license plate holder was a gift for an avid fan. This person is very fussy with his vntage cars and I unerstand it was installed immediately. must be good
1,The author knows nothing about building a network marketing business,"I worked with the author of this book in a network marketing venture..the only one he has ever worked. He was a horrible sponsor. He never worked the business and his wife was a vendictive person only interested in her own wellbeing. I have never encountered such evil people in my life. They were only interested in what they would get, never in helping anyone else. The author knows nothing about network marketing, only about BS...that is what he was known for in this company. This is the absolute truth."
4,Not too shabby,"I've avoided buying Pistols live recordings (save for Filthy Lucre) simply because I worried the quality would be suspect. But this ain't bad at all. It has the feel of a good quality bootleg, complete with between songs chatter and false starts. If you like thie Pistols, you'll like this; but don't play it for unbelievers."
4,pretest surgery,"content was amazing- much more than what is tested on the actual shelf, but if you know pretest, you'll do very well on the shelf.this book actually had more underlining in it than i expected, but none of the answers were marked so that was good.better than case files for the NBME shelf"
5,Addicting and So Much Fun,"I am not a game player, but this is the funnest game and so easy. I use it to unwind after a stressful work day or anytime I want to just relax and enjoy the silly little chuzzles. They make cute noises and faces and shake a wiggle. Anyway--they are fun."
2,Conveniant but superficial,I took this book to Amsterdam and was a little disappointed. It's small (which is good) and mentions everything important (also good) but so superficially that a lot of important stuff is glossed over or omitted. Friends who had read the Rick Steves book were much better informed than I.
4,Takes 2 listens,"1st impression i got was that this was an average album. But after subsequent listens, it has turned out to be quite good. In fact as good as, if not better then tiny shop by STP. A friend can't get enough of it and he's not really an STP fan. Almost a 5 starer."
3,its pretty good,".. the cd as a whole isnt too bad, there only a couple of songs i dont like but the rest are good , missing however is Weilands melodies and harmonies that would have improved every single track on this cd ..."
4,For those of you interested in your personality this is it.,"Unlike other personality books that attempt to help you improve yourself...this book explains how and why you are what you are. The explanations of personality profiles and family dynamics were written as if the author had studied my family and myself. Being a first born I found his extensive explantions very informative, but I feel the author may have spent too much time on the first borns and not enough on the others within the family structure. Overall the book is fascinating and well worth the price."
2,Not My Family,"Unfortunately, I didn't find this book useful or at all applicable to my family; I think a study of 3 generations of our family would make a great new book for Dr. Leman; he could call it, ""The Anomaly"" and I invite him to take us on. I drew this conclusion just from the introductory page, but pressed on and through and found no satisfaction what so ever. That being said, everyone should explore the doc's writings and see for themselves if this book provides any insight to them on their own situation (note that I suspect that you have to be a blessed with a near perfect family picture to begin with)so I donated my book to our local library."
4,Good insight into people I meet,"Currently reading the book and am very much enjoying it. One thing that I find helpful is that I can anticipate how someone will respond/react in a situation or understand their behaviors while others look in confusion.Female 7 years olderMale 2 years olderMale (me)It's interesting to see how based on our family dynamics, I take on last born and first born characteristics."
5,More Than Just Birth Order,"This is the type of book that makes a lightbulb pop over your head. You will understand yourself more, as well as your family. Leman is funny and extremely down to earth in his writing style (and I love his Christian references). He also includes very sound advice on relating to and parenting certain birth orders. I just finished this book, and I now want to read his ""Making Children Mind Without Losing Yours""."
2,"interesting theory, too much focus on God and author",So I read the book and am intrigued by the theory but it was hard to read the theory between irrelevant references by the author to how great he is and totally irrelevant remarks referring to his Christianity. Christiany and how a person interacts with God has nothing to do with his scientific theory and should stay out of the book.If the author had just stuck to explaining the theory without the unnecessary fluff it would have been a great book (even though I challenge the author to predict my birth order and that of my siblings).
2,failed transmission,"Uninspired industrial metal with poor melodies. ""Temptation"" is the only decent tune on here. After the fabulous ""Edges Of Twilight"" a disheartening turn of events for one of the better rock bands of the 90s."
2,Very generalised and specific to a sect,This book is written by studying rituals of a particular sect (Shwetamber Murtipujak) of jainism only. Author has taken liberty of interpretating the meanings as suited. It seems that conclusions were pre-prepared and he just had to link everything to conclusion. This book does not show correct and complete picture of jain rituals.
5,Great book!,"Laura MacKenzie wishes her family would update their two hundred year old inn for the coming century. But they run it the way it's been run since their ancestors came to America in 1685. Laura wants to go to college, to be modern and educated. Her parents refuse to allow her to go. Can Laura fufill her dream?"
3,Its not that quiet,"My computer is all about silence: Antec solo case, 12 cm cpu fan, Seasonic Psu...the vantec stealth was undoubtedly the loudest component in my computer.I bought the Noctua NF-B9 Fan and replaced the Vantec. The Noctua is far superior: comes with vibration absorbers, longer cable and speed regulators.Now my computer is totally silent!"
3,sabacolypse not now,"Lyrically i always thought of sabac as the weak link in nonphixion but still a capable mc. on his album he does nothing to change that opinion. the album is worth coppin' just for necros production but in all it just try's too hard, too much spoken word and filler content. there might be 5 actual decent joints on here, positive and negative, pow's and the aids joint are the standouts. cop the album if you catch it on sale and thats comin from a nonphixion goonism fan."
5,One of their best albums ever,I can't rave about this enough. Every song is great. That's NOT true of many of their albums.
1,Not as good as other release,"My rating is not for the movie. It's for this particular release.For much better picture and sound quality, go with this newer release:The Count of Monte - Cristo [ 1975, IMPORT , ALL REGIONSThe movie, itself: TEN STARS!"
4,A must for any Richard Chamberlain fan,"I first saw this movie when it aired on television in 1975, and I ended up eventually reading the massiveunabridged Dumas novel as a result. While this movie simplifies the story, and does not end true to the book, it is still worth owning for any fan of Richard Chamberlain, amd it is a quick-moving, mesmerizing story. I found the quality of the video to be excellent -- yes there are brief pauses where commercials once were when it aired on television, but so what? It doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the film. The sound quality was excellent, and it even played on our old, fussy DVR player."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE REMAKE.,"The remake of The Count of Monte Cristo was a much better movie than this one. I love Richard Chamberlain, but this movie jumped around too much."
2,"I remmber it well, but","this was a great old movie, but it wa hard to get that all the sub-titles were in another languge, or my 50 "" tv could not put the movie in CC. I thought it was sad.the buying part of the process was also hard to follow, and it took me ordering another 2 more items from Amazon to get the fell of ordering. also I felt the price was high"
2,The Count Of Monte Cristo 1975 With Richard Chamberlain,"As The Count Of Monte Cristo is my favorite movie ever, this version disappointed me greatly. I have read the book and seen the 2002 movie dozens of times and it FAR superior in every aspect to this one. The 1952 version is even better by a wide margin than this one. Chamberlain is terrific, but the events are not accurate to the other versions or to the wonderful book written in the 1850's.Stephen CourtsColumbus, OhioAugust 19,2011"
1,Junk compared to Solvit,"This seat cover is junk when compared to the Solvit deluxe. I had previously purchased the Solvit for my CR-V and wanted another seat cover for my F-150, so I bought this model. I purchased it because the Solvit does not come in black or grey that would match my interior. The big issue is that this only attaches to the the head rests. So therefore you dog will go sliding around when you stop or take a turn. This may be due to my truck having leather. So DO NOT USE WITH LEATHER. The Solvit has many bottom attachments that keep it in place. Which leads to no dog sliding around."
1,"Where Is It, THAT is what I want to know!",The person I gave this to as a gift has not received a single copy yet. What gives?This is ridiculous.Please respond immediately.
2,"Order 60mm fan, got a 120mm fan!?!","I ordered this 60m fan model SF6025L. I got a Vantec box labeled SF6025L, but inside was a SF12025L 120mm fan. I can‚Äôt wait for a replacement from Amazon and they are not offering a refund. So if I am going to get stuck with a fan, a spare 120mm will be more useful. 2 Stars for Vantec for using the wrong boxes for the their fans."
3,Weak Zipper,"I bought this slip-cover for baby number two as the slip-cover that came with the pillow had a broken zipper. Since it is the cover that has the fastening attached, this pillow doesn't work with-out it. When it arrived, I tried to cover my Brest Friend pillow and the new zipper broke as soon as I did that! How frustrating that these zippers are so weak and made of plastic- no metal in sight. Fortunately my hubby came to my rescue, spending about 2 hours but finally repairing the slipcover zipper. Then we very very carefully put it on the pillow, and voila! all is good. Of course had I known that hubby were so talented, I would've had him just fix the old one which has the exact same broken zipper and not had to buy a new one at all. So if you get this, be very careful when zipping it on to the pillow."
4,Blue is not the blue shown,"Like the deluxe slipcovers a lot better than the regular. The quiet release clip helps a lot. I was disappointed when ordering the Blue. It is not the color shown, it is more or a baby blue (light pastel color). The sunburst print on this page is also not DELUXE even thought it shows as an option under that title."
4,Nice,It's a soft cover. Loved the pillow when I nursed. My only complaint is that the brest friend pillow doesn't have a nicer assortment of colors. They should take note from Boppy.
1,Brest Friend is not so user-friendly..,"I bought this when I had my second child. I was hoping it would give me some support in my back while nursing. Sure, it offered support, but with it around my waste, I couldn't fit into my glider! I'm very petite, 5.2 and 120 lbs. My chair is rather comfortable. The only way to use it was to rest one side of it over the arm rest.Another major negative - after nursing, I could not put the baby back into the crib because the front of the pillow got in the way. So I had to hold the baby with one hand and unbuckle the pillow with the other. If this wasn't enough trouble, getting the baby out of the crib with a pillow already buckled was impossible because of it, once again, getting in the way. And try to hold the baby with one hand and buckle the pillow with the other! Yikes.I went back to my Boppy and used a regular pillow behind my back. Brest Friend is not so user-friendly.."
1,TOO many errors,"Very disappointed in buying this book as it has so many errors. For a beginner, it will be very frustrating to deal with. Very disappointed because I know the author is a Flash expert. Very disappointed that the Author, Editors and Technical Writers rushed this book out onto the market before testing, thoroughly, the examples in this step-by-step book. The only ones who will truly benefit from this book are the advanced readers versed in ActionScript as they have the knowledge to pick-up on errors. ActionScript newbies.... you will be very frustrated with this book."
1,Umm... Where's the meat?,"First of all the book is beautiful as it seems New Riders likes to put 'em out. I'm all for coffee table books. But not when it comes to Flash design.I want to read code to make me think about other code, and more code on top of that. I want my coding to improve so that my imagination won't be stifled as my skills won't warrant heavy creative ideas yet. I like nice design, and I am by no means a great scripter, but I think that this book went about 40% of the way that it should have gone.This book is pretty vanilla and full of fairly useless examples. There are quite a few coding errors throughout and overall I get a lot of eyecandy with nothing to hold it up. Brendan and Hillman have great reputations... but what's this book all about. Sorry - I just didn't like it. I wanted a lot more."
2,missed the mark,"This book claims to take the fear out of programming but it jumps right into writing raw code in ""Advanced"" mode as opposed to coding in ""Normal"" mode which I would assume to be the logical first step.The author does a good job of introducing the ActionScript language by using metaphors but failed to get me to actually program anything.This book is not for designers, maybe it is for programmers but, I would guess that programmers would require more depth than this book provides."
1,All words and no action!!!,"I hesitate even giving this book a one.This book is pretty useless at a very important topic. Most discussion is done without complete cohesive examples (from server to client).Don't even think that the included CD is worth it !!!Also, because of no author support I spent hours trying to make the .Net remoting example work in IIS all because the sample .config file was wrong (I actually found the solution at another website) !Discussions on integrating COM+ legacy components and accessing these from C# were also vague ! Again with no examples !"
4,Authentic,"One of the better introductions to meditation, the VCR is dated, however the information, especially concerning vowels sounds and mantras, is unique. The narrators voice is soothing, low pitched, and the sincerity of this recording is authentic."
3,Somewhat relaxing but mostly monotonous and dreary,"I am new to Krishna Das. I first remember hearing a song by him on a chill out compilation a few years ago. What stood out for me was his deep, rich voice. I recently found a copy of his ""Door of Faith"" cd at my local library and thought it would be a good introduction to his music. For the most part I found ""Door of Faith"" to be very relaxing to listen to especially on a rainy Saturday morning with a steaming cup of coffee. My favorite track on the cd has to be ""Sita's Prayer/Hey Mata Durga"". Unfortunately this cd gets awfully monotonous because of Krishna's vocals within half way through the cd. It doesn't help that some of the songs are over several minutes long. The music is beautiful and I do like Krishna's deep, sensuous vocals but I think the cd would have been even better had the songs been edited."
3,Not all tracks are original hit recordings,"The sound quality of this CD is excellent. All songs are by the original artist but several are not the original recordings that we remember. They seem to have been recorded more recently by the much older artist. I was especially disappointed in the new recording of ""Proud Mary""."
5,excellent,this is an excellent reference dictionary for spanish-english. It usually tells what the conjugated verb is before conjugation.The book arrived in very good condition.
4,ENGLISH/SPANISH DICTIONARY,The Spanish/English dictionary is most helpful in learning the Spanish language and is usefull in my Spanish class as a reference book.The book was more than I expected and am delighted with my purchase.
4,A Very Good And Essential Guide Dictionary,I find this New World Spanish English/English Spanish dictionary to be a very convenient useful and essential quick guide reference and translation for travelling and home use. A well recommended dictionary and a must have.
4,Melancholy Medley of Masterful Music,"""Only Love: 1975-1979"" is a fantastic CD. Each song invokes reminiscent feelings of youthful bliss for those of us who loved, lost and loved again. The title is fitting. The CD covers artists such as Fleetwood Mac, Olivia Newton John, Bread, The O'Jays and many more. As far as a ""series"" CD goes I would highly recommend this one. I was never disappointed in the music choices and enjoyed kicking back and reflecting on what a large role these artists and their ballads played in my life and actually still do today. I would like to purchase more CD's of this era/decade and hope that you will give this CD a try. It's a winner."
4,Good Baby Book,"This is one of the baby books in heavy rotation. Babys' love looking at other baby faces - and thats exactly what this is. It's not a huge or long book, but it's a good one and I'd recommend it as an addition to your collection if you don't alreay have. If you like the baby faces theme - check out the Baby Love board books by Rachel Hale - they are heart-melting and your child will enjoy them as well."
5,Every Baby Should Have This Book,I have purchased this for all my grandchildren and they all loved it - great book for infants on up! Great quality and durable as well.
3,Baby Faces,I would rate this book as average. I was hoping for something to teach my 19 month old different facial expressions for emotions. This book had a few that I was looking for - it seemed to have more expressions related to play then emotions.
5,perfect,"My daughter loved this book when she was just a month old because she liked to look at the different baby faces. She's two years old now, and she still likes to look at it. Very simple. And it's very sturdy too."
4,Great dialogue & subtle physical comedy,"This is one film where Matthau doesn't go completely ""over the top"". He and Clayburgh make a great team; I'm surprised they weren't coupled in other projects later.Add Barnard Hughes as ""Mr. Chief Justice"" into the mix, and you have banter and badinage at its best!"
2,Too Loud,"I just installed 2 of these on a HTPC case to replace the stock fans. I was hoping to get improved air flow with the temperature control, however since installing these they operate at full speed all the time (LOUD!!!). There are no speed controls so I can only assume that these are malfunctioning. The computer runs at 25-30 deg C (about 5 deg coller than with the stock fans but not worth the extra noise) under normal operation and I don't think that should necessitate the fans running full speed.Going to stick the stock fans back in and live with the slightly warmer operation. It isn't worth the trouble to return so I will keep for another build."
3,A cookbook NOT,"Not the polished text one would expect from the publisher, but its superficial treatment of the subject is fine for the ex-dBase programmer exploring some of the post-III/IV features of dBase."
4,Lovely,"This C.D. really touched my heart, and its really a good C.d.for couples and singles. Matter of fact , I am using #6 ""Did You Know"" in my wedding this winter. BeBe, out did himself once again!!!!!!!"
4,Quick overview of Irish Wars,"This well-illustrated book gives a good overview of the Anglo-Irish wars of 1485-1603. It presents an overview of the relationships between the two countries, defines the warring armies and identifies specific types of soldiers, including gallowglas and kern. The illustrations are its strong suit. Many period drawings are included as well as full color reproductions done by present-day artists. For people wanting to see how the soldiers dressed, this is a very good source."
3,104KEY USB Keyboard Black Pc Large L-shaped Enter Key,"I love the 104 keyboard. I have been in the computer business for a long time and the smaller boards are just too small for me. So I was please to find a USB version of the older board to put on my computer. Whether the board is kluggie or my USB environment is being taxed too much, the keyboard doesn't respond well. I am a fast typist so that might be part of the problem. I am looking to replace it soon."
2,audio cd,"Made a mistake in buying this product. Thought it was a video! Nevertheless, it formed part in my Nora Roberts Collection."
3,Nora Roberts,"Pleased with swifnest of order, but only received disc # 2 and #3 of Sea Swept in the container. Other books were all there."
5,r,Great book. Bought a copy for my daughter and thought I should read it as well. Has helped with my co-dependent clients
1,Conair Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer a Bust,"This is the most horrible hair dryer I have ever owned. The hose would not stay connected to the bonnet. It kept slipping off. I have only used the dryer one time. Will not use it again. If the dryer was more expensive, I would have sent it back."
2,Not a good hair dryer.,"After few minutes on , shut off , and it seen not to blow enough hot air to dry the hair. And, the attachments are not good quality."
3,Soft Bonnet not big enough,I have always had these type of dryers I perfer them. But this one the bonnet is not big enough and this one does not get the heat out as well. If I could I would send it back.
1,Horrible embarrassment!,"I bought this hair dryer for my mother for a Christmas present (in '09) and it quit working in January! She uses a hair dryer about once a week, so that's pretty darn bad! I want my money back!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!,this hair dryer does nothing to your hair but leave it frizzy and not completely dry!!!! And it constantly cuts off - this started on the second use so the vent could not have been clogged enough to cause this. Invest in a nicer dryer if you want your hair to look right!!!! I am definitely going to try to return mine to the store...it really sucks!!!
1,"Cute packaging, for a piece of crap that doesn't work","This thing doesn't actually deserve ANY stars, but that's not an option here, so it gets the requisite one star.Don't waste your money. Within fifteen minutes (I kid you not - I timed it, prompted by the negative reviews I saw on this site) of starting this thing up, the stoopid thing overheated and shut itself off. This thing spent more time off than on. With the quantity of hair that I have, I normally spend easily an hour and a half to two hours under any dryer in order to completely dry my hair.I'm going to buy another Lady Dazey dryer as soon as I can get my hands on one - I've had one of those for over a decade, and only recently has it started acting up!Do yourself a favor: find a Helen of Troy brand Lady Dazey soft bonnet dryer - those things are more dependable than anything else out there, and worth EVERY penny!"
1,Conair SB1 Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer,"I'm frustating too. I bougth this one the last year, and yet I can't dry my hair one time. Its terrible. Bad, bad. Dont have power."
1,The glitch was I ended up with 2 because you sytem wouldn't readjust the address info and I am stuck with the 2nd one.,The glitch was I ended up with 2 because your system wouldn't readjust the address info and I am stuck with the 2nd one.
2,Poor design,The poorly designed hose attachment to the bonnet often comes undone in spite of repeated attempts to seat and fasten it. I would not recommend this product.
2,conair SB1XR soft bonnet hair dryer,The hair dryer is fine but the bonnet is too small it knocks the rollers off your head when trying to put it on.
4,Like it,Its ok and would tell friends about it. I do not need any more lately. I have nothing else to say.
3,Okay but didn't perform as I expected,"I bought it to dry my hair while I applied make-up, kill two birds with one stone, but my hair is still wet and requires a regular blow dryer. It does speed up the regular drying but not as much as I hoped. If you have hair of any length and expect this to dry your hair completly, you better have an hour."
4,Get's the job done,"I bought this hair dryer because I did not enjoy sitting under my overhead dryer. I have very thick hair and it would take me up to 2 hours or more sitting in one position while being very conscious to not slouch. The Conair SB1 Bonnet Hair Dryer allows me to be more flexible with where I can dry my hair. Before I would have to be seated near a table only. Now I can sit on the couch or even lay on the bed. I have put this on and taken a nap while it dried my hair. It can be a bit uncomfortable since the hose gets hot after sometime and will touch your skin, so it does require some adjustment there. The benefits though were worth it to me. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has long hair drying times and would like to be able to sit at their PC or watch TV or just have their hair dry while they take a nap or go to bed at night."
1,Disappointed,I purchased this for my 87 year old mother for Christmas so she did not have to sit under a hard helmet dryer. The hose to this bonnet burned the back of her neck and the bonnet did not fill completely wtih air to dry the front of her hair. We have gone back to the old dryer. I would not recommend this soft bonnet hair dryer to anyone.
3,Okay for some things,"I like the bonnet for the compact convenience. But it's only good if you are deep conditioning your hair. If you intend to dry your hair, get a real hooded dryer."
1,Defective product,"This hair dryer only works for 10 minutes before it shuts off, and you have to wait 20 minutes before it will start up again. Conair says they have had no such problems with the dryer and blamed the source that Amazon obtained them from.They said I could return it for a refund but will have to pay the cost myself of shipping it back."
1,Bad for Long Hair...or maybe even any hair,"I bought this hair dryer hoping I could just sit in front of my computer, TV, or book and just let it dry my hair on its own. Unfortunately, that was not the case. First off, my hair is long and thick so maybe it was just that my hair was too thick for it to dry completely. But, still, I even left this thing on my head overnight and my hair wasn't completely dry in the morning. I occasionally had issues with it shutting off automatically like others have noted, but my primary issue was that it didn't dry my hair well at all. Good idea, poor execution. I would look to another hair bonnet for your hair drying needs."
1,IT DOESN'T BLOW IT SUCKS!!!!!,"This product does not blow (hot air) it sucks big time. Never again will I attempt to purchase another conair product without reading the reviews first.How could conair continue selling this garbage when it is clearly a defective item. I even attempted to use it on cool and not even that worked. After sitting there for one and a half hours of it turning on for only perhaps only 2 minutes at a time I finally gave up, frustrated and with my hair still wet.wet and mad"
2,Conair SB1 Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer,The reason that I got the bonnet hair dryer was so that I can dry my hair and have a little more flexibility to do more things while I was drying my hair and also dry my hair more quickly than sitting under a hooded dryer. I found that the bonnet in the dryer didn't inflate as much as I expected it to. It just kind of sagged on my head...especially the front part. It also takes a longer time to dry my hair than when I was using my hooded dryer. I was a little disappointed. I'm conteplating returning it if I still can.

1,Anime Bust,"Desperate for new anime, I bought this series and all I can say is that you get what you pay for. I couldn't watch past the first two episodes. Full of cliches and shameless ""borrowing"" from other series, Gun X Sword is a waste of time and money."

5,Absolutely essential!,This is the book you must have if you are even casually interested in wild mushrooms. I am replacing a copy that some cretin stole from me. It is a reader's digest version of the big book by David Arora that is also indispensable. Great photographs and very good descriptions of the most commonly encountered species. A nice touch of humor to make it more than just a reference. Don't miss this one!
4,Colors not as pictured,"I bought this as a gift because I loved using them with my own babies. Makes feeding them fresh things so much easier! However, they came in different colors than shown in the picture. Mine were pink and yellow. Would be fine except that I ordered them for a baby BOY!"
2,not sure,My son started teething about 2 months ago. So far I have only put ice chips in it since he is only 6 months. He really does not care for these at all. He looks at me like I am crazy when I give them to him and he is really not a picky baby. Not sure if I will ever put anything but the ice chips because it would be really messy.
1,"Weird Idea, Do Not Buy",I thought these sounded like a good a good idea but it turned out to be completely weird. You put food in the little net and then the baby is supposed to chew on it and suck the food out. However my kids all found it strange to have the net in their mouth and nothing we put in these made the kids want to use them. We threw them away shortly after purchasing them.
5,My baby loves these!,"I think these are great and so does my baby, yes they are a pain to clean but here are my top tips!1. Clean as soon as baby finishes (if you leave it for long it's not pleasant) - under hot running tap - turning inside and out scraping along seems takes a few minutes but comes up nice.2. Use frozen banana in it not fresh, baby will love it and it cleans up easier!Babies can use handle really well, and feeding themselves is great.This is my second set, they're great ( my baby now 6.5 months)"
4,Perfect for teething!,"I dont use these for food since I don't have a dishwasher its hard to get them clean. However I do use them all the time for ice cubes during teething. Or for frozen pedialyte when little ones are sick! They work great! Kiddos can chew away on them, soothing and tasty!"
3,Nice but not very useful for us,"I thought this would be a great for my little one when he started eating food around 5 months. For some reason I thought it would let him feed himself without a mess. He used it with soft foods like banana and pear and sometimes something harder just to chew on and maybe get a little bit of flavor out of. It was nice because he could feed himself or keep himself entertained for a little while, but it was very messy. It's also difficult to clean and get all the food out of the mesh. It seems to be nice quality and it's a great idea. The only thing is that for us I found that my son outgrew it so quickly, used it only a couple weeks, and then he was more interested in eating with his fingers. Since it had such a short use span for us I would skip it if I had the choice again. But for some kids it may be much more useful, especially if you're starting your kid on food earlier than 5 months."
1,Messy and Useless,I bought this item because I thought it would be a fun product for my baby to use. It was just too messy to be worth anything. My daughter found it difficult to get anything out of the product and it was difficult for me to clean afterwards.
3,No a good choice for young babies,I like the sturdiness of this product and it's features are great. Why I didn't rate this higher was because it's so heavy. My 5 month old daughter has the hardest time holding this upright. The handles are so heavy that she's only able to chew on the handle. The frozen milk or food I have in the mesh never really makes it into her mouth. If your baby is 9 months then this product is perfect. If your baby is new to eating or your using this for an early teether (like me) then keep searching. You little one won't be able to get much use out of it.
2,You'd be better off with the Sassy feeders,"We bought one of these Muchkin Fresh Food Feeders from Target and it worked OK the first time we used it. My daughter loved 'eating' with us at dinner time and there was no concern for her chocking on the apples we gave her...but after that it was all downhill. These feeders are fairly hard to open, and since it's not a screw closure you have no way of tightening it less or more. Secondly, the mesh bags do not come out of the feeders so you'll be hard pressed to ever get all the food bits cleaned out. I would soak our feeder overnight and still not be able to get all the left over food out of it. We have since boutht the Sassy brand feeders and they are much better. The mesh net comes all the way out and is much easier to clean. Plus, you can buy replacement nets so you can get rid of them as often and you feel comfortable with. In the end I will only use the Sassy brand mesh feeders and have thrown out my Muchkin feeder."
4,Bite Me,"I love this little nibbler. Well, my baby does. It's so awesome I can give fruit or veggies to my little one without having to worry about choking hazards. I read some people had problems with plastic bits coming off of theirs; I've had no problems with that.The reason that I am not giving it a five is the difficulty in cleaning it after using a soft food in it, such as banana.However, I did find a pretty good way to clean it. I use a cheap, soft bristle tooth brush. It allows me to get around the edges and into the mesh and along the seams. It's less time consuming than rubbing the mesh together. Also, I find that rinsing it right after it's done being used is really helpful."
2,strange texture,"the fabric texture was not loved by my son... we used it only the first time, it is not really a ""love at first sight""..."
5,Great Product for Teething and Feeding,"My son and I love this product. He is only 7 months old, so solid food still scares me. I put chunks of banana or broccoli in the feeder and he loves it. It's also nice for teething, I've been putting chunks of frozen bananas and peaches in and he can't get enough."
2,Eh... I threw it away after the second use,"My son used his a couple times. The only things we tried it with were avacado, strawberries and banana. It was impossible to get clean. I mean impossible. I loved the idea of being able to give him fresh fruits and veggies but honestly I found that mashing things up and feeding them to him with a spoon to be much easier."
5,Great for teething baby,"My baby loves Sophie, but when sophie's not doing the trick this helps. I put frozen fruits inside and he loves it. It gets pretty messy but I expect it being he's feeding himself. I would reccomend cleaning right after it's used."
1,Completely overrated and totally unsafe!,"I purchased this item from a target near home. after reading all the rave reviews about it i was super excited to test this out with my little one. I put some apple in it and he didnt seem to like it so i figured it was a bad idea to start with apple.. and went to switch to banana however when i opened the clasp i pulled out the apple and noticed there was blue plastic embedded in the apple like another reviewer mentioned!!!!I paused and figured maybe i didnt clean it enough.. so i did that for a long time.. but the fibers would still come out of the seam under pressure... so i tried biting it myself to see if maybe the bits of plastic would stay put or pass through the mesh.. and they came out of the mesh!!!! i was so frustrated.i would definately NOT recommend this to anyone.. even if it is only ""a little bit of plastic"" i personally dont think its safe and think that they should remove the seam altogether."
2,Very small and hard to clean.,The Sassy is better on both counts. It holds more food and the mesh is removable for easier cleaning and replacement.
2,Just ok,"I like the idea of the product and their competitor has one thats better because the mesh part is disposable in the other one. Thats the only problem with this one. You can wash it in the dishwasher or by hand, but its still a little unclean and unsanitary. Otherwise its so great for feeding baby and he can hold it very well, but being a mom of 5, I have tried everything and the one with the disposable mesh is alot better"
1,not happy with this item,after using it one time there was a hole in the mash and the other one is really hard to open. i dont recomend this brand!
5,If you have an infant you should purchase these,"Where were these with my other 4 kids? I love this product and so does my 7 month old (purchased them when she was 6 months). She goes nuts when she sees me walking towards her with one of these in my hands and it keeps her occupied for a good hour. Apples are her favorite, but we have also done melon, bananas and carrots. As the other reviewers have said, bananas are the messiest, but I just throw them in the dishwasher and they clean up real nicely. I freeze my bananas first and then put them in the mesh. Before they turn to mushy is when I take them away from her. I have recommended these too all my friends that have infants/toddlers. This item will not dissapoint you!"
2,Buy Baby Safe feeder instead.,"Hard to open, and the bag can not be removed for cleaning. Getting the food residue out of these things is difficult. Who wants to feed baby yesterdays dried on banana/pears/peaches etc. Buy the very similar Baby Safe feeder instead, it has removable bags, and easily but securely screws on and off."
1,Munchkin fresh food feeders are a mess!,I think these things are awful to wash up! I used them for bananas and it took forever to try and clean. I just threw them away!
3,On the fence about this...,"I like the concept of this but in practical use, my 7.5 month old isn't thrilled about using this. The handle is a bit heavy and I wondered why they couldn't make it a little lighter to hold. My baby ends up holding onto the mesh part of this b/c the handle is too heavy for her. Eating out of this does get really messy but that's going to happen any time babies try to feed themselves. I don't like the little snap clip that you have to squeeze in order to open this thing -- it's very difficult to open. I also bought the ""Baby Safe Feeder"" and that one has a screw top w/a removeable mesh liner. I like the design of that one better but this one is more durable and easier to clean if you manage to wash this right away."
2,Great but hard to clean,I like the fact that my son can eat different things on his own with this but it is very difficult to clean since you can not remove the netting.
5,A surprising tour de force,"I loved every page. One of the most surprising aspects of this book is how a man can write so insigthtfully and sensitively about the feelings of a young girl. It is truly a coming-of-age story with meaning for men and women of this era in America. The protagonist's reflections on her relationships both inside and outside of her ""Colony"" have lovely pearls of wisdom for all of us. All of my friends will find this under the Xmas tree this year."
1,"byron is a hack - ""them that can't create or write, hack""","the male kitty kelley - who makes his rise on the ashes of others... a lot of talented editorial went into TV CABLE WEEK and came out of it (notably Lorenzo Carcaterra - SLEEPERS author - incredible book, devastatingly incredible movie... not to mention Graydon SPY/ VANITY FAIR Carter) -What The World Needs a lot less of... is these folks who [Wayne's World] ""aren't worthy"" to evaluate, judge or even (so subjectively) report on others' endeavors or lives until they take a closer look at their own... sad, but true."
2,Outrageously Cumbersome to Read,"It's as if Morton had a bunch of trivia in bullet points and he put it all in sentence form. The reader is just bombarded with fact over fact.The sentence structure is painfully jumbled, which may make it sound smart, but is completely unnecessary.I have to read ""To his French-Canadian followers, Laurier's ghost would be their guide to a successor."" twice to make sure I understood what I was reading. Why couldn't he just rearrange it simply and say: ""Laurier's ghost guided his French-Canadian followers to a successor""?"
1,I was sent the wrong item,I was sent the wrong item instead of CARS PC game and it caused a virus on my computer so I had to return it.
3,A Bit Dated,The detailing information is fine but the recommnedations for detailing products is dated. This book should be revised to include improved products now on the market and exclude products you can no longer find.
2,Shipped in too big a box.,Unfortunately we have not had a chance to use these nails but it will be a bit of a pain once we do. They were loose in the shipping box and rattled around in there and came unglued from each other so we'll have to feed them into the nailer piece by piece. At the most there are maybe 20 nails stuck together. So when I was in town I purchased 2 boxes at $5 more than Amazon but will be worth it in the long run with the time saved feeding nails into the nailer.
5,wow,"wow, this had been sitting in my watchlist for months. Probably due to subtitles. I was pleasantly surprised. Great film... bet we will be seeing an english remak in the near future"
4,Interesting and entertaining movie,It is a smarter movie than it is being described.The plot is more complex and the hero is not an action hero.worth watching.
4,Excellent!!,Wow just Wow!This movie really surprised me! I decided to see this movie because I had nothing else to watch and I am so glad that I did! Don't let the fact that this movie has english subtitles keep you from missing a very good movie! I am not going to get into what this movie is about because other reviewers have already covered the basics of this film. It is really worth it although it has some scenes that might not be for the squemish the plot was very good and I can't wait to see what else Norway comes up with! Enjoy!
2,Nice forests,"There are some attractive second growth woodlands in this film - our unattractive, dishonest, self-centered, whining leading man spends a lot of time running through them to make his rather implausible escapes. It was hard for me to imagine the beautiful blonde could have or should have ever cared for him. I am sure there is some satiric intention here aimed at the corporate world but I found it all rather predictable, not suspenseful. Keep your money to save up for a good painting."
4,Great movie!,"Just watch it, you won't regret it.Nice, intriguing, even funny, and with a well developed story.Highly recommend it."
1,technical problems,"I would seriously caution anyone against buying this collection. There's at least two extremely annoying technical glitches. The Lohengrin prelude act 3 is marred by two seperate dissonant trumpet blasts that are each wince-inducing. And something seems to fall on the floor during a quiet passage in the Parsifal prelude, producing a noticeable ""THUMP"" that will attach itself to your memory of the piece. Highly recommended collection if you see it in the library, good introduction to Wagner by a competent conductor. But significantly flawed."
3,Not bad,"I wish it would have been a heavier ply plastic, but its okay and serves its purpose; i probably would not order another one though."
4,"Good product, Fast service","I ordered this telephone for its style, I wanted something that looked old-fashioned but not too frilly. It seems to be of reasonably good quality. My main suggestion is with regard to color of the phone. From the name and order info offered I assumed the phone only came in the color black, no other colors being offered. However, when it arrived the product's box had a photo of a white phone, which I would not have found acceptable, the phone inside the box turned out to be a dark green in color which, as it happens, was even better for my purposes than the black. This variety of colors is something that should be addressed in the order process so that the purchaser does not have to send back a phone of an unacceptable color."
4,Great storage and marinating container,"I normally utilize this for marinating or brining to be place in the refrigerator and for capacity, it does fit nicely."
4,Monarch of the Glen: Complete Collection Review,"We have really enjoyed this series and it has been a very cheerful and relaxing show to watch. The setting and scenery in Scotland are beautiful and the show was off to a very strong start. Our criticism would be that some of our favorite main characters left the series mid way through or toward the end. We liked some of those actors better than the new ones. Overall, it was an enjoyable show to watch and I would recommend it."
3,Beautiful scenery and the show becomes boring.,"If you want to see what the highlands of Scotland look like, this is a nice way to see it. The story, however, becomes boring after the first season. The same stuborness of the characters becomes tiresome. The parents ""don't get"" that their home is in danger of being lost and therefore are anything but helpful in saving it. It just becomes the same show over and over."
2,What can I say-it's a triangle!,"My daughter bought this as a present and a gag gift for her brother. It was the best price around, and it does what it say on the package...the end."
4,Incomplete But Good,"The Claris system used to contain the soaking solution and rewetting drops. For some reason the rewetting drops are not only no longer included, but impossible to find. However the soaking solution is a winner! No drops cost this rating a star. Include the drops or at least make them available and it 5-stars for Claris"
3,Pretty good for the price,"I guess I should have read the description for these notebooks a little better -they were not quite what I was expecting as far as size and content. But they are nice and sturdy and well made which is pretty good for the price I paid for them. They are handy little books, and I think a good deal."
5,The Heart of Me: Preventing Failure...,I am an educator and I found this book to be very uplifting. What we do is a hard but very important job. This book offers good ideas presented in an upbeat way. My hats off to Sharon Gentry! What lucky children there are to have/had her as a teacher.
2,Not what I needeed,Arrived trimed. Needed untrimed for sponge painting. Teimmed would not work. Was not clear in photo. If had known would not have purchased ti.
5,Awesome product,"Shipped quickly, on-time delivery. Well made product. Could tell the difference in quality (A+) when compared to the previous fan (Masscool) right away. Easy to install, very quiet indeed.Have a great day!"
3,Good....but not the best,"The light is very bright and the flex torch is very handy, except that the holding clip is not sturdy enough and there is no base to hold the light in position."
1,Nothing Special,Does not leave the fur with luster. The product contains nothing to make grooming easy. Like the vet texts say--gentle human detergent works best.
5,Built Tough,"I've owned this receiver now for over 2 years, and I have had no problems. As a matter of fact I keep it enclosed in the storage area beneath my television. It's so easy to use, my four year old knows how to work the basics when daddy can't find the remote.It's survived 4 shipments to and from Japan, and still no electrical problems (shell was dinged up from UPS...the bozos!). I'm not an audiophile or a stereophile, just a guy who loves watching movies in surround. Hi ampage = clean sound. I've tried maxing out the amp several times. Still, no distortion at high volumes. Read the specs and look at the important 75 amps versus some of the other 500 watt receivers. You'll find very few for the price."
4,Jazz Is Alive And Well.,"""Give & Take"" is the first I've heard of Mike Stern, and am I glad I picked up on it! I've been missing out on some great stuff. This is the best jazz I've heard in years. The tracks featuring Mike, John Patitucci, and Jack DeJohnette dominate the album, but there are other welcome guest appearances throughout. These musicians have some serious chemistry. Mike is a damn good guitarist, and with all the stellar support, it's every bit as good as you'd expect. I can't imagine any jazz fan regretting picking this one up. Great CD!"
4,ANOTHER SUPERB PRODUCTION,"Histoire et Collections has done it again.A fine work of the quality which the collector and researcher has come to expect from this publisher.I have previous works on the British Tommy in NW Europe and Canadian soldiers. All are elaborately illustrated with charts, individual item photos, and reconstructions worn by models of combinations of equipment and clothing as qoen in northern Europe. In addition there are many lists, charts, and tables gathering together informatioon gleaned from many scarce and obscure publications.Muxh of rhia work has appeared in the excellent French language periodical Militaria published also by Histoire et Collections. This method of proceeding has the great virtue of first publishing in a more temporary format and inviting the readers to submit corrections and additional data which can be used to improve the final work published in book form."
3,D-Day Paratroopers: The Americans,"I was somewhat disappointed in this book. There were many errors in translation, few mentions about gliderborne troops and not enough information on equipment and uniforms. It doues have some good information about specifc men, units and operations, but overall just a basic book, nothing special. There are better airborne books out there, especially for D-Day."
4,one of my favorites,i remember this album from 1980. brings back fond memories of playing dungeons and dragons in my basement during highschool.
2,very pricey,Lots of fun for 10 min. then can is empty.Be prepared with several more cans.Gets rather expensive especially for more than one kid!!
5,Absolutely love it!,"If you even remotely like CSN&Y, this CD is a MUST! Very close to his father's music in harmonies, lyrics and guitar, but with a slightly more ""modern"" sound. I received this CD as a gift from a fellow music lover and have purchased several copies for other people I know. Anyone who likes great singer/songwriter folksy music should certainly check out Chris Stills."
5,This is one of those mandatory CD's,Chris And Ethan have joined forces to give us one of the most amazing recordings in years. I listen to it almost everyday and can't wait for their next project.
5,A Must for traditional Catholics,"This is a wonderful book about the use, the history and the meaning behind hundreds and hundreds of metals, scapulars, beads etc. So many young people have a yearning for sacramentals and this is a wonderful book on the many the Catholic Church has."
4,To Tell the Truth?,"True or not, it is a fun read.I found it useful in understanding the mindset of Hedge fund management and not just the Rev. Jim Bob. I had imagined Jim's operation as a Mahogany or Marble walled complex located at a prestigious Wall Street address operated by Gen-X boiler room sharks. Instead the author paints a scene of a one-table room above a Deli whose walls have long past needing a fresh coat of paint (let alone Marble or Mahogany).If this book had been written a fiction, I would have found it hard to believe the antics of the principal character. Since it is published as a non-fiction ""Kiss and Tell"" about Cramer, I think it is more believable.Did Jim do all the things the author claims? Don't know and don't care. I am sure everything done in the book was done by some Hedge Fund manager somewhere.If the accounts are not true, Cramer has a great lawsuit.After reading the book, I have started playing: ""Gangsta's Paradise"" before each trading day!"
1,Book Doesn't Fullfill Title,"Just finished this book and was so disappointed I decided to write this review.Yes, Cramer is a jerk. Yes he's a nasty boss. That was the basic point of this book. So what? Go work for someone else. I read this book to hear the truth revealed about Cramer's dealings in the stock market and the truth behind the SEC investigations into Cramer's behavior. What I got was: He's a mean, screaming bully and, oh, by the way, the SEC investigated him and he was found innocent (but he did ""worry"" about the outcome). Hardly revealing or even interesting.Hardly worth the cost of the book. Also the author seems to have a love - hate relationship going on with Cramer.Save your money."
2,Reality Investing,"There seems to be a discontinuity between trading a la James Cramer and rational investing a la TheStreet.com. Is Jim just a day trader or did his hedge fund have significant long term holdings? The author doesn't tell. Of course, there had to be significant long term positions, but the author wants to attack Jim so that is what he does. It's hard to believe Jim or anyone short of a gangster would threaten another man's children. Maybe he was yelling that garbage into a dead telephone to relieve pressure. This is a story I cannot trust. What we have here is an author who lived in an alleged hell for five years who only left after he was fired and then complains."
2,Disgruntled Employee Trashes Employer,"Basically, this book is about a young man who lands a job at Jim Cramer's hedge fund. Works there for 4 years, makes more money that ""both his parents combined"", and then finally walks out after the Cramer gets fed up with him.There are some funny moments in the book, like when Jim throws computer monitors across the room, bashes copy machines into small pieces, constantly yells obscenities, threatens brokersThis writer would probably do a good job for the National Enquirer. Let's take a story and but a monster twist on it."
2,Problems,"This book could stand a translation into English; or, at least, a language editor. I found myself, repeatedly, struggling to understand what a given sentence might have been intended to mean; and, occasionally, failing."
2,Disappointing,"Poorly written and an undistinguished entry in the survivor adventure genre. Hard to believe a book like this, where a National Geographic film crew accompanied the kayakers, does not have a single photo or illustration. And no map!!"
3,MOTOROLA RAZR V3 RED RUBBERIZE CRYSTAL CASE,THE ITEM I PURCHASED WAS SUPPOSE TO COME WITH THE BELT CLIP WHICH WAS THE REASON FOR THE PURCHASE. WHEN IT ARRIVED IT DID NO HAVE THE BELT CLIP ACCESSORIE AND NO EXPLAINATION SO I CALLED AND THEY SAID THEY WERE OUT OF THEM. THE RUBBERIZE CASE I DID GET IS GREAT EXACT COLOR AND ALL BUT QUITE DISAPPOINTED ABOUT NOT HAVING THE BELT CLIP. ALSO WHEN I CALLED THEY SAID THEY HAD IT IN THE CLEAR AND WHEN I RECEIVED IT IT WAS PLASTIC SO I HAD TO SEND THAT BACK. I DID ASK THEM IF THEY DO GET IT IN WOULD THEY SEND IT TO ME I HAVEN'T HEARD BACK YET
4,American Poet,"I won't say Dylan is the greatest poet of our age, but he is incredibly gifted and one of the best known. Anyone who thinks that words can matter should stop here."
3,Pretty Package for Stuff Available On-Line for Free,"Bloated. What's needed is a decent book of the actual way Bob played and sang the stuff. Chords, melody, tab.All that's on here is available on the internet just with a couple-dozen keystrokes and a few mouse-clicks.Maybe useful for sub-Saharan Africa, Outer Mongolia, parts of Siberia."
5,Lyrics Minus Zero/No Limit,"A compendium (I like that word) of most of the great mans songs in chronological order. No more, no less. That is it. Just the songs, so if anybody buys it looking for an insight into the thought behind it, then they really should have bought Chronicles or any of the many books which teach of such things. As for the 26 year old guy who was looking for the inspiration to Dylan's lyrics. Read the other books, then look around you. His inspiration is everywhere. Fantastic book, does exactly what it says on the tin... well, cover."
3,Not as good as previous releases,"I would disagree with the previous reviewer. I don't have the album but I know a good number of the songs on the album. Bunji and Onika ""Get on Bad"", Maximus Dan ""Soca Train"" and ""Strings"" by Burning Flames are excellent tracks that should not be missed by any Soca fan. Unfortunately, of the three big tunes for the year, not one made it to this album. At least one out of ""De Band Comin"", ""Craziness"" or ""Bonnie and Clyde"" should have made this album."
3,Nice Crow Sounder but the mallet is flimsy.,"I'm rounding up some instruments for my daughter's preschool class and before I bring them in I let her test them out to realize their potential. Here's the rundown:My daughter is 3 years old and I don't know if she possesses super human strength, but on the seventeenth strike of the mallet on the Hohner Kids Crow Sounder the little mallet that could, couldn't anymore. It snapped in half into two lovely pieces. No big deal though as her grandpa's a woodworker and offered to construct us some quality mallets. The Crow Sounder is still rocking though."
2,Kutless is ok,"Honestly their first CD did nothing for me. There is a few ok songs on this but if you want Christian Rock look elsewhere. Granted I've seen these guys live they put on a great show, and there really cool in person. It's still not enough to convince me this album was worth the buy."
2,morally reprehensible,"Harrison has talent as a writer. Unfortunately, understanding that this is a 'true confession' leaves me with little sympathy for the author. She was 20 when the affair started, however, I wonder if she had the moral consciousness of a 3-year old, or if she was as much a sociopath as her father? From her telling, it seems the incest was motivated by a rage toward the mother, both by the husband and the daughter. All three individual's are so completely self-absorbed as to act with only pointed hurt toward one another, while trying to justify their sadism by proclaiming their own victimhood. I wonder what would motivate a person to reveal something that portrays herself in such a horrific way, is it a desire to shame herself in public........or sell books?"
3,Haunting and Emotional,"Kathryn Harrison's memoir, ""The Kiss,"" recounts Harrison's relationship with her father. Harrison's father left her family when Harrison was a very small child and he has little-to-no contact with her until she reached her teens. After reconnecting with her father, the two embarked upon an incestuous relationship that is the focus of the memoir.This book had the potential to be a Jerry Springer episode. Just the most basic premise, a young woman having a sexual relationship with her father, is the stuff of daytime talk shows. But Harrison crafted a moving and emotional account that leaves the reader haunted. Using none of the trappings of sensationalism, Harrison weaves her tale with grace and tact. I wept when I read this memoir. It was so captivating and enthralling. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of memoirs."
5,As good as progressive gets,"The only progressive house CD that I have heard that I like more than this is Hughe's last offering, 'Altered States'. This CD is dark, fantastic and very 'underground' - don't expect to hear many of these tracks anywhere else!! An 'altered' mellow state would go exceptionally well with this CD! Buy and enjoy..."
5,"Dancing bears, painted wings.....","I admit that I bought this CD for one main reason - to hear the full version of Deana Carter's rendition of ""Once Upon A December."" I am listening to it as I type this review. By the way, was this Fox's first animated motion picture?"
5,NOT just for children,"Ok. Im annoyed. Annoyed at the fact that a wonderfully done film, like Anastacia, is automatically branded as something that just children will just enjoy. Well, guess what: THIS MOVIE IS NOT JUST FOR CHILDREN. This movie is for ALL ages, meaning that EVERYBODY can watch it, not just children, and enjoy it. Having sex, drugs, blood and violence does not make a movie ""better"".(XXX anyone?? Absolute load of CRAP!) A movie can have NONE of the above and still be good. By the way im 18 and I love this movie. Anyway, the soundtrack is wonderfully done, except for the POP versions of the songs, which I cant stand..basically because the POP songs woundn't exist without those beautifully created brodway/musical songs. Well, theres my two cents worth."
2,boreing!,This isnt a very good soundtrack.There are only about 2 songs worth listening to.I just listened to it last night and I almost fell asleep.Dont wast your money onthis one!
5,A Journey to the Past,"I bought this cd for that one song, and I ended up with one of the best cd's I have. That has to be one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard, and Aaliyah really did a flawless job on this song. I don't think anyone could have done it better. Her sweet voice just captures the song's essence. In fact, I can't listen to this song without crying. Nothing about this song is hokey (like most animated movie songs are), it is a mature, beautifully written, prefectly sung ballad. I absolutely love this album, and I recommend it to anyone and everyone."
4,blondie Live,Sound quality is average at best. Image quality is below average for blu Ray. These 2 things would generally put it in the pile of rarely watched concerts. However the dvd is quite enjoyable. The band is very good and Debbie is a joy to watch.I love the venue and it's shot extremly well. I've had this disc 3 months and watched it more than any other concert that i own.
1,unprofessional technical details,"how can anyone list a high amp hour battery without its amp hour rating? the three most important details on a battery are voltage, amperage, dimensions in that order."
5,BEST BOOK ON BOXING,"I fought in the pros for 8 years and in the amateurs for 6 and this is the best book on boxing I have ever read.I give it to my friends as a present for birthdays, graduations and retirements"
5,Great Historical Reading,"What an opportunity to learn boxing from an actual bare-knuckle champion. Donovan's book was endorced by such greats as Bob Fitzsimmons and Peter Jackson, and should be of great interest to any boxing historian. Also, it is a great opportunity to learn boxing skills from someone who actually fought such greats as Jack Dempsey ""the Nonpareil"", Jem Mace, and John L. Sullivan, just to name a few. Doyle Studio Press has done a great service to the sport of boxing by reprinting this fine work."
2,Did same author write the second half?,"As several others have noted, there is a substantial style difference between the first and second halves of this book.The simple direct elegance of the first half was replaced by quite the opposite in the second half.This is a very good book for C++.It is a far less desirable book for Visual C++."
4,Not bad for the beginner...,"This is actually a pretty good book for the beginner in visual C++. It is especially useful if you need to learn how to use the somewhat complex-seeming Visual C++ interface. I found the C++ guide pretty good, and certainly useful in learning the basis of the C++ language. The MFC stuff is okay, although I think I'll have to get another book to actually understand what I did. Horton is a very informative author, though his humor is occasionally dry and rarely worth more than a chuckle... In short, good book, but not perfect."
1,Horrible explanations and techniques! 8,This was the book that our teacher used in our Visual C++ class. It was absolutely horrible in explaning what was going on within the code. I still have no idea what went on during that class. I really wish that our teacher would have used another book. Ivor seems to me a very confusing man...and to most of my class.
5,A Fantastic Read,"A Fantastic ReadThis book is terrific. I really liked the fact that it put the attack in the context of the Second World War. It gives you a good understanding of the conflicts in Europe and the Pacific and helps you to see why the attack was so pivotal. I've never been all that interested in books about war, but this one proved to be engaging and very moving. Susan Wels has done an outstanding job presenting the people and the politics behind this much-discussed event."
2,Hitch Pitch and Hard on the Ears,"The block is well made with a good finish. The mallet is a bit small, but that is ok. The real problem is the sound the block makes when struck. It is very high pitched and loud. It hurts my ears. Wanted to give the kid something fun to learn about sounds and rhythm but I don't want to hear the sound of this toy every again."
1,"Whither goest thou, Mrs. Peel?","I saw this movie with almost no expectations--I'd seen almost all of the '67 series on video before seeing this--but I was still incredibly disappointed. Steed and Peel don't come across as witty and smart; their dialogue seems stilted and geared to one-up each other (""I'm wittier than you."" ""No, I'm wittier than you."" ""No, I'M wittier than YOU."" etc.) There was almost no chemistry between the stars, which is what held the TV show together. There also seemed to be a lot cut out as the plot really didn't explain what Prospero was about and how DeWynter's weather generating equipment would work against it. The weather equipment also seemed to work only because DeWynter said it did. Hopefully, the film industry is getting a clue and slowing down on producing films based on TV shows..."
1,"Not as bad as ""Lost In Space"" but close!","Being a huge fan of the 60s cult series I feared the worst. ""The Avengers"" was also voted the worst film of last year in lots of magazines and I can't blame them. Fiennes and Thurman has got absolutely no chemistry together which was partly why the series worked so good. The FX is okay but watching Sean Connery in a teddybear suit...I mean, even as a so-bad-it's-good movie it doesn't work. Patrick McNee sold his soul by telling viewers in a behind-the-scene doc. that it's even better than the series! Needed cash that bad? To hell with this bomb and long live Diane Rigg!"
1,Appallingly bad,"If you have to read a novelization to fill in the plot holes, it isn't worth doing.No matter who is to blame for this travesty, be it editor, director, screenwriters, the terribly lethargic performances from Thurman and Fiennes (I personally would lay the blame at the feet of the lot of them), it isn't worth the time or money.I'm not even much of a fan of the original, having only watched an episode or two if that, but this- this is a pathetic film.There is zero chemistry between the two stars, Sean Connery hams it up (and with dialogue like his, can you blame him?) and the plot, as has previously been stated, well.. saying it ""has holes"" is an understatement of the first order.An amateurish effort all around. Who would have throught that a film with Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and Sean Connery would be so... boring? I wouldn't even give it one star, but I'm being told that that isn't an option."
2,"""One should never fear of being wet...""","I have to say that I am not familiar with the series, or had had any other contact with the characters apart from this movie so I cannot make any comparisons to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have. Therefore, coming from someone that did not ""know"" of The Avengers prior to the film I have to say... that I was rather disappointed!Apart from the GREAT cast (Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and Sean Connery among others) and the very good acting, the plot and the dialogues are way below average! In addition, the whole ""weird"" atmosphere just for the sake of being ""different"" and ""original"" just falls flat!Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off. A shame really...In a nutshell, it's a weak movie; it lacks that something to make it bearable, let alone put it over the top. No masterpiece here."
1,Ugh.. Make it stop...,"I can count on one hand the number of movies that I've actually stopped in the middle because they were so bad I just couldn't tolerate watching the rest. And this pathetic movie is one of them.I'm not sure what they were thinking, but the plot is slow, the british humor is lamer than normal, and what on earth was up with the giant Grateful Dead-esque Teddy Bear costumes??The only thing worse than watching this movie is the fact I originally confused it with something else and didn't realize I'd seen part of it on Cable before and then ended up trying to watch it again to see if it realliy was that bad.. and indeed it was. I couldn't sit through more than 1/3 of it this time either..No James Bond/007 here.. this is a big dud.."
3,THE SIXTIES AGAIN,"The chemistry between FIENNES and THURMAN is non existant;the special effects are programmed to keep you from sleeping;CONNERY looks bored and should retire to cultivate tulips.The funny thing about this movie is that in FRENCH the dialogue seems better.If you are over forty like me,chances are you enjoyed the BRITISH series with DIANA RIGG and her lovely boots.The sixties have never been so popular since AUSTIN POWERS,but there is a limit to the filmgoer's tol√©rance.This film works best on television as a time-killer."
1,"Mrs. Peel, your needed, to destroy all copies of this film!!","The most looked-forwarded to movie of the year for me. Now, the one I hope I can forget the quickest. I blame it all on the director. Who in Hollywood pays these imbeciles to make a movie like this. How in the world could anyone ruin a movie starring Fiennes, Connery, Thurman? - Totally beyond my comprehension. If anyone out there knows a place I can get an elective frontal lobotomy, please let me know. Do a service to one in deep suffering."
1,Really the worst,This is one of teh worst movie I have seen for many years. Bad story. Can you believe special agent use umbella to flight? Disappointing!
1,An abomination,"How did this movie get released? This movie is an excellent example of why directors should not be allowed to go unsupervised. And what the heck is Sean Connery doing in this? I fell asleep while watching this (really). When I awoke, I glanced at my wife, and discovered that she was also asleep. Bad. Very bad. Watch the TV show instead, and let's pretend this movie never happened (like Mission Impossible)."
3,Avengers - the dissapointment,"Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman were miscast. They didn't have the tongue in cheek quality that Macnee or Rigg brought to the series. Elizabeth Hurley in the first Austin Powers film would have made the perfect Emma Peel. Some of the dialogue scenes captured the flair of the series. Many elements of series might have seemed strange to movie viewers unfamiliar to show. Mother, Steed's Bentley, for instance. The problem was with the script. they didn't have a bizarre teaser that opened most of the shows. There was no suspense, they didn't use the wonderful Avengers music enough and parts of movie seemed disjointed. Connery seemed to be sleepwalking through the part."
2,arg!,"i give this film two stars because although you have to question why three good actors such as these would even consider this script, they still acted well with the poor amount they got. but still, how could great actors such as these three accept such a terrible script? what were they thinking?"
1,Very disappointing acting and plot,A truly disappointing re-make of the Avengers series! Poor-quality and often childish acting and a soppy plot. The original Ms. Peel would be badly disappointed!
5,DEVO New Traditionalists,"The husband is hard to shop for; small towns don't always have what I need, hate to travel and no time to travel finding what I need is here at Amazon. Found what I need in great shape at a great price and arrives quickly so always have a gift on time for a great guy, he likes Devo so glad for a one shop site--Amazon."
1,Not enough information on Gift Basket business.,This book is written for Canadian market on how to start any business.Very few inrmation on gift basket business. The book is very small and it does not address to the the needs of USA market. There is no list of USA or Canadian suppliers. It will need a lot of imprevement in the next edition.
2,Below Average,"FRank, Joe and Chet travel to Australia to search for a missing scientist, kidnapped by a gang that is trying to prevent the launch of the Firebird Rocket. This book was not one of the better books of the series. The mystery is average, but lacks any original thought. The first 100 pages of the book are somewhat boring and rarely entice the reader to continue. After that, the book gets better and is fairly interesting until the end. If you can make it through the first half of the book, the second half is worth reading."
1,Abolutely the Worst Recording Quality every heard!,"This has got to be WORST RECORDED (audio quality wise) CD in the history of sound engineering ever!Insult to injury is that I actually returned another bond themes CD I had bought before to get this CD because I thought that didn't sound great, but this is even worse! I wish I'd have just kept the first CD.Love the music but hate the sound. The recording engineers have failed tranfering the sound from tape to disk without compromising the quality. I think the old but original tape or record would probably sound better! Even the newer digital era tracks were sub standard.Sorry but I will have to give this a one star because of this unforgiveable flaw."
4,cinnamon,"This syrup is good but not as potent as I had hoped. Also, it is expensive. I purchased it from Amazon because I could not find it in local stores. I probably will not buy it again."
2,Mediocre,"I was first introduced to _Jekyll & Hyde_ by being dragged to a performance. I thought it had a great deal of potential, but was otherwise very bland and conventional. This recording, despite the vocal proficiency of the esteemed Colm Wilkinson, highlights that bland, convetional nonsense. I find most of the ""11th hour songs,"" the ""showstoppers,"" the majority of the songs on this album, to be utterly forgettable and derivative of pop songs on the radio's Top 40. The only thing saving this album are the few wonderful bits, like ""Transformation."" I suggest purchasing another _Jekyll & Hyde_ album."
1,This Recording is VERY VERY Bad (Except for Linda Eder),"This is not at all worth buying. THis is one of those things that you get on a cheap tape that someone else makes for you, just because you're curious to hear how Colm Wilkinson would have sounded as Jekyll & Hyde. His wierdly undulating voice just doesn't work for the part. Linda Eder is, of course, wonderful, but she's on two other recordings as well...with two better Jekylls, with much better non-synthesized music, with much more songs...get my point? True, there are songs on this recording that aren't on the other two...and there's a reason for that. So, without wasting too much more space on this page, I suggest this: Hit the <back> button on your browser to return to the search query results you got when you did the search fro Jekyll & Hyde, then click on either the Original Broadway Cast Recording or the Double CD concept version and purchase either/both of those."
5,The most moving of all the versions.,"I love the original Broadway cast version, but this one, ""the concept album"", still remains my favorite. Colm Wilkinson and Linda Eder are both superb in their roles, and the orchestrations and arrangement of the song sequences are much more moving and effective. A winner in every way."
1,Tremendous Disappointment,"The theme is a husband who is trying to understand the craziness of her wife after arriving from a trip; all of her life (and husband investigations) are not surprising and not significant. There is no surprises, no reasons; the woman is just insecure, weak and lost in herself.The theme is very weak. Reader expects more, as you keep reading you get disappointed, bored and angry. I finished the book because I was expecting a surprise ending to save it, but definitely, it is the worst book I've ever read! I don't understand how it obtained an award, it jeopardizes the award itself.Not a good book to read!"
3,Interesting contemporary,"The Silent Rose was the first contemporary romance that I've read from Kat Martin. I enjoy her historicals much more.When Devon James and her fiance go to spend a night at a B&B in Conneticut, Devon is unprepared for the feelings and visions she endures during her stay. Determined to find out the meaning of these visions, Devon begins to investigate the history of the home.When Jonathan Stafford is informed that Devon is investigating the history, he will do everything in his power to stop her (it doesn't help that he's a multi-millionaire either!). He'll use everything in his power, including seducing her. Neither Jonathan or Devon are prepared for the love that blossoms between the two.This was a pretty good book, but I found it could have been much better. I didn't think that Jonathan and Devon had the chemistry that Kat Martin's books usually have."
1,Very slow moving,"I always try to finish a book once I start it but with this one I simply couldn't. Every time I sat down with it my mind started to wander and I found myself skipping over sections simply picking up dialogue in hopes that the plot would pick up. It started out interesting with the ghosts in the old house, but soon fell apart when she returned home to New York. I felt the main characters were rather cold and distanced from the reader. The relationship between the hero and heroine seemed staged rather than heartfelt. After about three hundred pages I couldn't stand it anymore. Too much pointless talk and descriptions and not enough action. Perhaps if she had cut the five hundred pages back to three hundred it would have been better. This is one I will definitely trade into the used book store so that I can pick up something more interesting."
4,absolutely amazing!,"I bought this CD about a year or so ago, before I had even seen the movie. I saw the previews, and fell in love with the music, and decided to get the CD. I'm happy that i did. Not only is the movie great, but so is the CD. The music goes along beautifully with the film. Some of my favorite songs include: Life in Mono, Resignation, Like a Friend, and Wishful Thinking. This is a great CD, and if you liked the movie you should get the CD."
5,More than I had expected,"I bought this cd for one song: Life in Mono. When I listened to the rest of the cd, I was pleasantly surprised. The soundtrack is just as good as the movie! My favorite songs are Life in Mono, Sunshower, Wishful Thinking, Today, and Her Ornament."
5,Magical dream,"If you have ever searched for that place between reality and dreams, between human reticence and cheek-burning emotion, then perhaps this lovely jewel is for you. Reminiscent of M. Duras and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, it quietly speaks of the explosive passions and longings inherent to the human condition."
3,Smooth as Silk,"The book, though short, has lasting lyrical qualities. The author's musical backgraound is evident in his repetitive depections of the main charachters sojourns to and from Japan. Much is left to the imagination. This is an ideal read for mature book groups. There are so many things unspoken, that readers are open to fill in many blanks It opens doors for exploration into the Silk Trade.An enjoyable read."
2,let's calm down,"this novella's a breezy, engaging read, but it's principally a sketch and insufficiently developed to justify, in my view, the accolades it's getting from most reviewers. the story seems to me to exploit (and not so originally) a very basic, primitive fantasy. there's a somewhat neat twist towards the end, but still, it's pretty much a fluff piece, as i read it. this man can write, no question, but this is a light, not deep, book, whose impact dissipates quickly."
2,Didn't do anything for me,"Maybe this book was too subtle for a dunce like me, but I didn't get the allure. It was given to me with rave reviews by my boss. I thought the info on the silk industry at the time was interesting. But I didn't get how he could fall in love with someone from such a distance. I didn't have any emotional investment in the characters. Like someone else said, maybe something was lost in the translation to English. Short read, so not a huge waste of time."
1,The Emperor's New (Silk?) Clothes,"This novel is a Zen wannabe that forgets that simplicity is not necessarily elegant, but can instead be empty, and not in a good way. ""Silk"" is not a novel, but rather a greeting card -- devoid of interesting characters, characterization, and psychological plausibility. The alleged international popularity of this empty and hollow narrative is a mystery to me, although I suspect that it belongs to the same club as ""Jonathan Livingston Seagull"" and ""Bridges of Madison County."" I was just glad to see that such things are not uniquely American publishing phenomena."
2,I love Bette but...,"This is a very big disappointment. I don't understand why they just didn't record the whole Vegas show and release it that way. This doesn't show the fun side of Bette. I can't believe they left out the song ""I Look Good"". That's one of the sides of Bette I love the most. It's an awesome performance. What is on here is just plain boring. I'm so glad I got this at the library."
2,I don't get it.,"Here's the thing, this show is lacking in any of the usual Bette Midler scintillation and sparkle. I am thinking of Diva Las Vegas, The Bette Midler Show, and Art or Bust as highlights of her finest moments.She seemed pissed off to have to be on stage throughout most of this show. The most off putting thing of the whole thing is listening to her complain about being tired. If I had flown from Boston to Vegas to see this show and she was complaining about being ""so tired"" after I paid $120 to see her I would be FURIOUS!!! The other issue, why the hell is this so short? with so LITTLE singing?To give a reference: if you saw the episode of my life on the d-list where Bette was a guest and she seemed to lack any genuine interest in what was going on to a degree which she seemed irritated and bothered, it's kind of like that, but with an audience, and no Stay With Me."
5,Musical Greatness !,"This is the second CD of Michala's I listened to after purchasing the double set of her best works.This album takes the baroque music of Handel into more detail.As always,Michala plays every note to utter perfection and creates a very moving experience for baroque music lovers.I can highly recomend this CD as well as the other set I mentioned."
5,Funny in Every Way,"Bill Hoest is one of the best funny men around. And Leroy and Loretta (the Lockhorns) are his champions. These two blast one another in every possible way, and their marriage counselors as well, while delivering tons of laughs.If you want to have a really good time, lift the cares of the world off your shoulders for awhile, and enjoy a tremendous laugh or two along the way, turn to the Lockhorns. It is a book I have read more than once, and I laugh outloud every time.I highly recommend this book and any book by Bill Hoest about the Lockhorns."
4,Good book!!,Verry helpfull. Every thing I expected. If you need this book I highly recomend it to use. You will like it.
3,Sure doesn't scare squirrels!,"I bought this water gun to shoot at squirrels through my study window as they climbed up into my squirrel-proof bird feeder. I had fun. They had fun. But they seemed to regard my activity as no threat at all--as just one more interesting behavior of a stupid old lady. I finally foiled them with a big metal cone. Too bad. I think we both miss the entertainment.Oh yeah, the gun. It was pretty powerful and reasonably accurate. However, I'm generally opposed to war toys, so I couldn't very well give it to my grandsons. It would spoil my reputation."
4,She is FINALLY in her element!,"I never really used to like Kelly Clarkson. Every song on her sophomore album, ""Breakaway"", became singles and I got totally sick of them. And I also thought she wasn't creating the right type of music for her vocal style. And with, ""My December"", she is making the right type of music! When I heard the first single, ""Never Again"", I was like HELL YEAH! This is it! She has finally done it! The rest of the album did not let me down either! ""One Minute"", ""Sober"", ""Haunted"", and ""Irvine"" are amazing songs and some of the best of her career! Great job Kelly! Continue on this path and you will have a new fan in me!"
3,A few good songs,"I was very excited to purchase this CD, because I really love Kelly's voice, etc. etc. Also,I purchased ""Don't Waste Your Time"" from the album on iTunes, and I'd heard ""Never Again"" on radio stations and such, and I love the songs. I was accordingly very excited to get this new album. I don't think it's the best, however. True, she wrote the album at the bottom-most point in her life we've heard, but the rest of the album seemed mediocre. Not as bombastic as her voice is, or the other two songs that I've previously mentioned. I suppose a die-hard fan of Kelly Clarkson would buy this album to support her, but I wish I had just bought the few good songs on iTunes instead of purchasing the entire album."
1,disappointment,"I had high hopes after hearing her other featured music, and of course on ""Idol"", but this one really left me turned off. The first eight cuts at least just irritated me to listen to, and successive attempts haven't improved my first impression. I dunno what it is, maybe it's just me."
1,Waste of money,"I have a great deal of respect for Kelly Clarkson her voice is amazing. However, this cd is Kelly at her worst. I found it interesting that many comments state that Kelly has matured on this cd this could not be farther from the truth. The lyrics are at times whinney, bitter, and down right nasty. Aspects which do not automatically prove maturity. Do not buy this cd it is a waste of money!!! I'm sorry I did."
1,Listen to Clive Kelly,I think Clive was right to shelve this album for 4 months and wanting her to redo the whole album because this album is really really awful!
2,"Okay, single Remix is better","Not Kelly's best work. The Remix to here single, "" Never Again"" is better then the whole CD. Hard to say that since I am a big fan of Kelly's since I my girlfriend and I meet, had to say that for a bro."
3,A few good songs on this one!,"I'm a singer myself so I like to hear the actual talent of the singer more than the ""noise"" that overshadows it.There are a few songs on this cd that I enjoy listening to but overall, I was rather disappointed.UPDATE: Now that I've had a chance to listen to this cd a couple hundred times, it's becomming one of my favorites! I really can't wait for Kelly to record the country album she has planned for next year!!"
5,A short time ago ...,"Kelly won American Idol. Them came ""Thankful"" and ""Breakaway"". Now Kelly is on her way to become the best singer in the wolrd (I think she ist it at all). This album is absolutely wonderful !!! May be that there are some songs on this album which are not ""radio friendly"" but who cares. The storie told by this album ist fantastic and Kelly was so honorable to refuse a lot of money from here record label to put some itchy pitchy pop songs to it. Kelly - I will let you know: There are a lot of fans all over the world and here in Germany, too. Kelly ---> WE LOVE YOU!"
5,An Honest Review,"I'll admit it, I'm a Kelly Clarkson fan, and have been since I first saw her perform on American Idol. She was the first and ONLY contestant that I've ever voted for. one reason: THAT VOICE. That girl can deliver a song! Thankful was an ""ok"" CD, but seemd to only scratch the surface of Kelly's potential (The Trouble with Love, Low, Anytime, Just Missed the Train and Beautiful Disaster are standout tracks from this album). Breakaway was a great improvement, though not perfect..it took all the strengths of her first album and magnified them times 10. My December, in my opinion, is her best album to date. No Fluff, No Sap, just real, raw emotion. She shows her edge, but there is also a tenderness and fragility there, you can actually feel what she is singing (just listen to Sober, Maybe and Irvine to see what I mean). Get this album...you will NOT be disappointed."
4,BUY DIS ALBUM IF YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO SOME GOOD MUSIC FOR A CHANGE.,"Alright if you are one of them, ""OMG"" girls, with your bleach blonde hair, gum popping, lip smacking, britney spears wannabe's u ain't gonna like this album. However, if you like a singer who can actually sing, and song writer that actually writes songs that mean something and make u think. Then hell yeah. Buy this album. From songs like sober, be still, maybe, irvine and yeah; Kelly is showing that she is growing, and changing, And that she has alot more to offer then alot of them fake a$$ wannabe pop stars out there."
1,So disappointed!,I really wanted to like this CD but I didn't enjoy it at all! I love Kelly Clarkson and I think she has an awesome voice but this CD did NOTHING for me. I really gave it a chance and listened to it twice but I won't be playing it again.
2,"""Never again"" Kelly, make an album like this!","Well... This album wasn't very good with about two exceptions.1. Never again2. One minuteKelly Clarkson is/was one of my favorite artists. She slipped greatly with this album. All of the songs she was mad and screaming!I was very glad to hear ""my life would suck without you"", as it seems she has gotten her pop sound back. I am very much looking forward to All I ever wanted, and hope it will be as good as Breakaway was."
2,Dissapointing,I Loved Kelly's first two albums and there is no denying that Kelly has an amazing voice however almost every song on this album is about love or hate. The most of it is about revenge and after a couple of weeks listening to it I was depressed. Although there are a few upbeat songs they don't carry the album.Not great.
4,"This is not ""Breakaway"" part 2, good job Kelly","I always look for honesty from an artist. How can I believe you if you don't believe yourself? Well I believe Kelly Clarkson on this CD. Gone are the catchy and cute pop songs from previous CD's (though I liked some of those too). These songs are much more honest, pure, and just plain honest. The CD starts out as a hard rock CD, but quickly turns to a more sentimental approach towards the later stages of the CD. The only song I didn't care for was ""Yeah."" It was just a little too redundant for me. That aside, this is a compelling follow up to Breakaway, and her most honest CD yet. I look forward to hearing what she gives us in the future."
4,Kelly does it again!,"An angry CD, telling a story of breakup, love lost, confusion and self doubt in finding love, hard rock, more than pop. Different than Breakaway, more angry than blues, harder. But lots of energy, good variety in the songs. I love the last song Irvine, softer song. I look forward to Kelly's creative growth. I do recommend the CD; I am listening to it almost every day at work. But it is not the rollerblading, workout CD that Breakaway was."
2,Probably won't work if you are a Bible Believing Christian,"THis book has some good ideas about listening actively, and involving all parties in decision making and conflicts. However, this author does not believe that parents are a child's authority, and that children will be blessed by obeying parents, (basic Biblical foundations for family structure.) I've read lots of Christian parenting books which teach you how to understand your child better, and how to talk to your child better, and which don't rely so heavily on corporal punishment. But this book flies against the very nature of the family structure which I believe God has put in place."
2,"Quick learning, yet too many code errors","This book starts out right, because it did keep me captivated for a few chapters, until you start to write the code. The code is all wrong, it doesn't compile due to errors. Another drawback is that the book is full of the same code, repeated again and again.The only good use of this book is learning the basics in pseudo code, without actually writing real ASP.NET code."
1,This book is [not good],"After reading through the first 20 chapters, in which no programming occurred until Session 16, I finally gave up. When I hit the first source code error in a simple form validation program I chalked it up to a simple typo. In Session 20 I couldn't get their program to work at all, to say nothing of the source code not even appearing on the CD-ROM!Whatever you do, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!!!... As has been said before, if I could give it zero stars I would."
4,"Fascinating story about an unknown ""saint"" in a little known era","A little on the long side,but, in all this was a fascinating well written book. Teresita is a woman I would love to meet. Despite the adulation, she is true to the people around her, exhausted by the role she is asked to play, yet willing to sacrifice her mental and physical health to do what she can to ease the suffering around her."
5,Best book I've ever read.,"Urrea is a great writer. I cannot say enough good things about his book or his writing. The story alone is fascinating, and with his abilities, this story becomes a work of art. I agree that it is a modern classic."
5,Excellent writing from a great story-teller,What more can I say. I got to the end of the book and returned to page 1 for a second reading!
5,Right up my alley,"This story was a great mix of history and interpretation. I loved the roughness as much as the sweetness. The bilingual consideration was well executud. The only drawback was the price on Kindle. I almost missed enjoying hours of entertainment because the price was a little more than I budget for optional reading.I'm looking forward to reading ""Into The Beautiful North"" next."
1,Junk,"Really not very well made. It does not have LED bulbs so batteries will not last long. I like the fact it will stand up like a tripod. That's about it. other than that it is an expensive, cheaply made flashlight."
2,Don't waste your money,"If you are looking for an inexpensive hair dryer to take with you on vacation this might be for you. If you are buying this hair dryer because you believe it is a ""quieter"" hair driver don't waist your money. I compared it to two other hair dryers my wife has and it is just as loud just a different frequency."
3,Easy use but temperature's too high,"It's very easy to use it but the temperature of the wind is high, and I'm worried that it may damage my hair."
3,dryer,"quite, but no where near as quiet as I was expecting, however, it was a GB deal so no complaints"
3,gates of sleep--literally,"rather disappointing read by Lackey. However, it's not the simplest task to take a fairy tale and make it new. She's still my favorite author."
2,Could have been better,"Don't get me wrong, Lackey is a good author. All the other books I have read - Serpent's Shadow, Phoenix and Ashes, and Black Swan are all engaging reads.But this story disappointed me. It had a good start, but it ended in a boring and bad way. In Serpent's Shadow, the protagonist is a Earth Master who is rescued by a Water Master. In this book, it's the other way around, which disappointed me. I'd have liked to see Marina paired up with a Air Master or some such, so as to not repeat Earth x Water.This book had a lot of potential, but unfortunately it started to sputter out about halfway through the book and ended poorly.I really hope that for the next Elemental Master book, opposing elements are paired up together. I'd love to see a Water Master being wooed by a Fire Master. Now, that would be a more than engaging read, provided that Lackey put as much effort into that tale as she did Serpent's Shadow and Phoenix and Ashes."
1,a waste of time,"Geeze. This book was just terrible. The writing is poor and the plot is tired. I have read and enjoyed the other books in this series, but I would suggest fans skip this one."
4,What did I miss?,"It's always tricky for an author who is writing an addition to aseries of books to keep the integrity of the books preceding, and still write a book that can stand on its own. ""Stray Kat Waltz"" leaves me bereft!None-the-less, this is an intriguing story with an important background topic of spousal abuse and--probably--bi-polar disorder, as well as nursing home care and insurance fraud. These themes, plus a captivating plot line and deft characterization, make this novel a good choice for the mystery buff. I enjoyed it all the way through its surprising conclusion."
1,Who wrote this book???,"Each year I anxiously await a visit with my friend, Kat Colorado. I love the characters, not just Kat, but Alma, Lindy and Charity. I was so excited by the publication of this book, I couldn't wait to start reading. What a huge disappointment, Alma and Lindy were only briefly mentioned and Charity had such a small part. It felt like someone else was writing for Ms. Kijewski."
3,Not same as picture,The picture of this item shows it to be 40 watts...but when it arrived(on time)it was only 30 watts.Not sure how much difference 10 watts makes but that is the reason I chose this one over some others.First time I have been disappointed in any way with anything purchased from amazon so I decided to let it slide.
3,It could have been better...,"I wasn't expecting too much when I purchased this hot glue gun. It was cheap, made by a company I know, and shipped quick. It needs an on off switch. Yes, it is easy to bend down and unplug it but even better would be to just turn it off. So instead, it stays on for long periods and drips out hot glue too easily. It also didn't come with any glue sticks, not one. You would think it would come with at least one?"
4,"Good but, difficult for beginners","This book is a great new look at drawing your own superheroes villians ect..But, beware this book is not for most beginners it goes over the subjects in the booka little to quickly. Andrew Smith assumes the reader has a pretty good understanding of what he talks about. SO, if your a beginner I would stay away from this book till you have learned the basics. I gave this book 4 stars because I already had the firm understanding of what he talks about. This is a great book overall and helped my drawing ability greatly."
3,Not for beginners,"Although a generally informative book, it glosses over too many subjects too quickly. The instruction is sound enough but the author assumes an already established level of draughting ability for the reader. For this reason I would certainly not recommend this book for the beginner. If you already have a quite high level of drawing skill & experience with comics, then perhaps you'll love this title, otherwise leave it alone until you've covered the basics."
5,Good as always,You just can't beat York Peppermint patties.Too bad we Americans can't make as Mexican food as well as the Mexican can make American peppermint patties.
1,High cost,At Sam's stores you can buy the 175 count for $12.98. My restaurant customers LOVE these with their guest checks! Guess I am taking a trip to Sam's. Sorry Amazon. I will remain loyal and use you for all your other great deals though.
3,Cheaper at sam's,You can buy this entire box of 175 count box for 11.66 at sam's club. Don't waste your money here friends. Save some cash and drive down the road to a sam's.
2,Confusing. Could be much better.,"My one year old daughter really enjoyed looking at the babies in this book when we received it, though she became bored with it after a couple of weeks. Here is what I don't like: The purpose is to teach colors, but the colors are confusing on two pages. On the red page, the little girl is wearing a pink jumper over a mauve outfit. The only truly red thing in the picture is the strawberry. On the pink page, the dress has yellow, orange and red flowers on it. Another confusing aspect is that on the green page, a leaf is the highlighted object , but the little boy is not holding a leaf. For every other color there is a highlighted object, and the baby displays that object in some way, but they are inconsistent with the green. If your child loves to look at pictures of babies, you may want to buy this book, but if you want to teach your child colors and show him/her consistency, you can do a better job making this book yourself."
5,Great movie,"This movie is hart worming and magic also sad, thomes up to the writer & producer Great Movie and great actresses, I Loved this movie so I bought the DVD movie"
4,A weak story..something was missing....,"Now don't get me wrong. I usually don't write negative comments on movies and especially on a movie with Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock in it. BUT.....there was something missing in this story...can't put my finger on what, but....it didn't leave me with a very good, satisfying feeling the way movies usually do.The acting was excellent. Especially Kidman's. She is SO gorgeous that I was desperately trying to find flaws in her! (sorry Nicole:)...and couldn't find any!!! Tom is extremely lucky, but then so is Nicole!!Anyway, the acting was very good, there were some cute parts and some good special effects but other than that, the movie was an ok movie. I, personally don't feel you missed anything if you don't see this movie. Just my opinion, tho."
1,Is 1 Star the Lowest I Can Give It?,"Even Satan would get bored watching this dumb story of two witch-sisters and their problems with the men in their lives. This movie seems like it's trying to be a comedy, a horror movie, a romance and a ""chick-flick"" all rolled into one, yet it's never funny, scary, or romantic and the ""chick-flick"" elements are all rehashed Hope Floats-Mermaids stuff that we've seen before. The last scene where the movie attempts to turn a satanic ritual into a Tupperware party is both laughably stupid and disturbing in its handling of demonism. If you like original, interesting movies , don't waste your time with this one."
5,Movie,I watch this over and over. It's a great film.The stars chosen to play the characters area great match.
4,Always Loved This Movie,I have always loved this movie. I had it on VHS and watched it over the years until the tape finally broke. Then I bought this DVD. Worth the time and price!
2,"Nice premise, great cast","I wanted to love this movie. I like the premise and almost everyone in it. It just wasn't done very well unfortunately. I found myself doing other things while the movie was playing, and then ""poof"" , like magic, it was over. I haven't given it a second thought since."
3,Light entertainment for chicks!,"I guess, judging from other reviews, many liked this. I enjoyed the performances but the story, not so much. I watched it free with prime but would not want to pay for it.For a witch story give me Witches of Eastwick anyday!"
2,Who Okay-ed this script?,"I have seen bad movies before, but not with so many headlining actors/actresses. It's absurd and there is no rational explenation for why such big names would make such a poor excuse for a film. It doesn't even have ""it's moments"". The script is badly adapted from a novel by Alice Hoffman, who, I might add, is a very talented writer. ""Practical Magic"" is slow and has no tention nor climax. Scenes happen seemingly at random and I found it hard to sympathize with the characters AT ALL. I expect this type of low quality from movies designed for the ""Seventeen Magazine""- ""Dawson's Creek"" audience, but not from the big names who made there money not only by being talented, but by choosing well written scripts. If you have a choice, watch ""Speed"" or ""Portait of a Lady""."
3,Mildly Entertaining But No Witches of Eastwick,"This film lacks the acting chops and the wicked appeal ofThe Witches of Eastwick. I adore Sandra Bullock and DianeWeist and Stockard Channing are always favorites, butNicole Kidman's fake looking wig, gangly white legs, andartificial sounding American accent ruined it for me. It couldhave been a great film if they had chosen someone moreappropriate for Bullock's sister in the movie. Too bad KateHudson or Anne Hathaway weren't available at the time. Ifyou have to own it, buy it used."
1,"What is this? Horror, romance, feel-good family feature?","This film was very disturbing. A confused mix of Steven King's Pet Cemetery crossed with Sandra Bullocks sappy romance ""All about Steve"". What a waste of talent!"
5,Not completly correct with certain concepts of Witchcraft but the closest Hollywood has gotten.,"I love this movie. Despite myself practiceing the craft and this movie being slightly wrong about some certain concepts, overall it's damn good for Hollywood. We don't kill people or bring them back from the dead, or even mess with people's lives. But the overall concept in the movie was correct. Do see this movie even if you are a Witch or not. It's awesome."
4,Love It or Be Toad,"Saw this years ago and enjoyed it just as much this time around, especially the Midnight Martinis routine. This endeavor has suspense, murder, enchanting participants, special effects, exquisite acting and Halloween Eve witches jumping off the roof ... Magic, pure Magic."
5,Still one of my favorite movies,"Excellent cast, script and acting. Bullock and Kidman are great together and I'd love to see them in a movie again."
4,A Witchy Movie,"A funny, star studded movie on witches.Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are perfect in it and it's nice to watch Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest (Parenthood) in costumes.I'm only giving it 4 stars because there is a scene in it where they poke a pigeon with something sharp during a spell(they don't show it, but it's clearly implied). I don't like to watch any animal being hurt and it urked me. Sooo Hollywood! You shouldn't be hurting anybody/anything for a spell--can only bring bad karma.Otherwise, it's an entertaining movie :)If you like movies on witches, you may likeHocus Pocus"
1,So Very Very Bad,"This movie was so bad, so pointless and plotless, so corny and ridiculous, I had to warn someone, even though there are already more than 230 reviews and most of them are glowing. Anyone who gave this a 5 star review is a very peculiar person."
3,Still playing...,"Not as good as previous releases. Still worth a listen to these O.C. punk legends. Gonna go the them this weekend at the ""Slam"" even in Costa Mesa this June 27th 2010!"
2,Great Design--Poor Follow-Thru,"After purchasing this unit, I was put through the trauma of having to exchange it 3 times, before finally giving up. I think if someone was lucky enough to get one that actually was not defective in some way, it would be an outstanding player, but I have to believe that the good ones are few and far between, if I got 3 defective units in a row. Buyer beware!"
2,Blech,"Okay, when I first picked up Twisted Christmas several years ago as a kid, it was great. The little kid singing about Santa Claus being stuck in the chimney, and the christmas song about deadhead were the kind of humor that best appeals to kids.Now, however, Mister Rivers has lost it. I regret wasting the money on Twisted Tunes #2. If you want comedy/music combos, go with Weird Al or Doctor Demento collections."
2,"Recon Line of fire 60"" tailgate lightbar","I purchased the recon Line of Fire 60"" tailgate lightbar for my 2006 Lincoln Mark LT. Ford/Lincoln trucks have a small shaft that keeps the tailgate from crashing down when opening and requires that the lightbar be modified to fit. This required alittle work, but I was able to install. The 3M backed mounting strips are Mickey Mouse on this unit and are questionable if they will remain intact. I would suggest adding additonal tape or using screws when mounting. As for the lights they are as advertised, bright, BUT, when the turn signals are on not all the flashing lights flash with the same brightness thus looking cheap and Mickey Mouse. ALso when the brake lights are illuminated some lights appear more bright than others. I would not recomment this lightbar and would definately not buy this again. I would go with the Plasmaglow."
5,Worth it!,"My daughters love it and sing along with the songs. They have to find letters, shapes, treasures, etc. and just enjoy every second playing it. The hard part is to make them turn it off! I love the fact that it is in Spanish since that is our first language and my 4 year-old plays with it like a Pro!"
3,Songs/Singer are a 10+ -- however the disc I received has 'skips' on EVERY song!!! IT'S SO aggrevating!!!,HIS music So Speaks to me --- and yet EACH and EVERY song has 'skips' in it!!!!!! I could just Scream!!! Have waited SO LONG to get his CD and this makes me FROTH!!!
5,The Awesome 80's - Revisited,"This CD is a great means of traveling back to the 80's, if only for a little while. The people who would benefit from this the most will probably be those who grew up in the '80's and long to hear the music of that time period. It is a compilation of a variety of songs some of which are less likely to be seen in ""Top Hits"" sort of compilations, but still represent the decade well. Don't be suprised if this CD may end up on your ""Favorites"" pile."
3,Not packaged as pictured.,"I purchased this as a gift, so I can't comment on how well it works or doesn't. However, the package that I received does not look like the picture. I received a plain white box with a single sticker labeling it ""Squirrelstop Mail Order"". It will work, but, considering that this is a gift, it is disappointing to not receive the item in the retail packaging as it was pictured."
5,Love it!,"My 18-month old loves this book. The activities and characters are familiar to our daily lives and she loves ""discussing"" each page's event. While she has never seen Sesame Street on TV, she loves the characters anyway."
4,Works well,"This is a good metal spatula. I use it frequently and purchased to replace my plastic one which always peels after use. It is attractive and functional. My only complaint is it is bigger and heavier than I would have liked. Not the spatula end, but the whole thing is very long, so it takes up a lot of room in my drawer."
4,Key Trilogy,This is a wonderful set of stories. My wife and I were on a long trip and really enjoyed the excitement of the young women on their quests. The is a lot of sex as in most Nora Roberts books but is doesn't detract from the plot.
1,nora roberts key trilogy cd collection,could not even get through this ...my mind wandered off and well just plain bored me to tears....I paid $14.99 for the series...and could not listen...
4,Should be the first device driver book you read...,"This is an excellent book. Approaching device drivers via DOS is probably the best method to understanding device drivers in general. As to previous comments that the examples were written in assembly rather than C, this is a strength, not a weakness. Many drivers during the heyday of DOS were written in assembly. And while assembly is. admittedly, a difficult language in which to program, it does force you to stick your head into the hardware and keep it there (which is what device drivers are all about).The only negative comment is that the book cannot be viewed on the Amazon website, particularly the table of contents and an excerpt."
2,Bubblegum with flavor that doesn't last past the first chew,"Turns out the pop song isn't as easy to perfect as they thought. Ok-Go try it 12 different ways on their debut, with varying degrees of success - from the good (""Get Over It"", ""You're So Damn Hot"") to the gawdawful (""C-C-C-Cinnamon Lips""). In between there's lots of shoutalong choruses, Cars-influenced keyboards, and chunky guitar riffs. Sorta fun, sorta ho-hum. The potential is there but, in the words of Vince Lombardi, ""son, you can DIE with potential""."
4,"Poignant, Pleasurable Pop Rock","Ok Go's self-titled debut is a terrific album packed with 12 wonderfully clever rockin' pop songs. The 2002 indie rock scene perked up when this album hit the stores. It opens with the powerfully addictive sing-a-long ""Get Over It"" and doesn't stop caressing your ear drums until the short but sweet anthem ""Bye Bye Baby"" fades out. Other highlights include ""There's a Fire"" with a bass line so groovy that you'll swear you were born to dance, and ""What To Do"", where the guitar riff is very tasty. When it's all said and done, you'll be cheering loudly and be very glad that you've purchased this album."
4,Pop rock done right,"I was introduced to OK Go by a friend of mine on the bus, about a year ago. All I was able to hear was ""Get Over It,"" which got me interested enough to buy the CD. As far as I knew they weren't popular yet, I hadn't (and still haven't) seen any videos. However their music is a rare blend of rock and poppy keyboards that even the hardcore music fan can dance to when they're alone in their room. Not that I do that, or anything...Almost as geeky as Weezer, as catchy as Harvey Danger, and more fun than the All-American Rejects, this is definetely an album worth your money. However I'd like to see the next album have more than a measly ten tracks."
5,This Is A Big Hit,The lyrics and beat are amazing . The songs are amazing like Get Over It which will be one of the best songs 0f 2002-2003 . This album rulz !
5,Bought the album for one song and wound up liking every single one,"I heard the first song ""Get Over It"" on the internet and bought the single. Then I listened to a few other tracks and decided to buy the album from Amazon. I was completely taken aback. The whole album is great. The last time I liked an ENTIRE album was REM - Green. If you are debating whether to get this because you've heard one or two good songs then buy it. It is as good as you hope it is."
4,Good not great,"'OK Go' were an unknown quantity to myself as I usually stick to more tried and trusted bands such as Nirvana, Pixies, etc instead of the pathetic junk on the radio. Luckily for me I encountered 'Get over it' on the internet and tracked down this album, listend to a few samples and clicked 'buy' and have no regrets. The songs grow in you and you find yourself listening to the first 2 or 3 songs, then 4, then 5 and then the whole damn thing over and over."
5,Most fun I've had in ages,"This is the first time I've ever bothered reviewing an album, simply because this album is fantastic and I wanted to spread the word.The review that says the lead singer sounds like he's grinning when he's singing decribes me when I'm listening as well.A great, fun album. Enjoy!"
2,A few good tunes but they don't stand up to repeated listens,"Kind of blah power pop, with the slower numbers ""Return"" and ""Shortly Before the End"" the best, along with the catchy ""There's a Fire"". Most of the other songs are completely forgettable, especially ""C-C-C-Cinnamon Lips"" and ""You're So Damn Hot"". The keyboards and backing vocals sound pretty good, but the lead singer's voice has very little range or personality. I give them credit for selling this CD for a (somehwhat) reasonable price... but all in all it's just not that good. I'd recommend any Fountains of Wayne or Superchunk CD over this if you like good catchy power pop."
5,Excellent and fun introduction to Myers-Brigg Types,"This short and fun book is a wonderful introduction to the Myers-Brigg types. It is written in an easy to understand, humorous style and is meant to be as entertaining as it is educational. If you want to know the basics and have a good laugh this short book will not disappoint you. It is also well-organized and contains quite a few great cartoons."
3,Cartoons not legible on Kindle,"I would like to see this book in another format. From the reviews, the cartoons are an integral part of the book. Even with changing text sizes, the cartoons are not ledgible."
3,Not quite what I expected,"This book was TOO 'easy'. I wanted a summary, but the text read more like a magazine article than a serious discussion and comparison of the personality types."
1,Text to speech disabled!?,"I already own Please Understand Me, but I wanted to buy this book so I could listen to it on my Kindle. But the author disabled text to speech?! That really upsets me. They won't be getting my money!"
3,An extension of Myers-Briggs,"I'm not really ready to provide a review of this work, so I'll describe instead the intended application. Business owners occasionally want to examine what aspects of their personality contribute to their work. Myers-Briggs typologies have received considerable interest from the public and the Enneagram is a more contemporary extension of this work. I find surprisingly little research and statistical work on Myers-Briggs and have reservations about the utility of the work beyond a kind of face validity. That said, this text provides a readable overview of the typologies and may be a useful reference for those who wish to assess their entrepreneurial path."
1,"Was nice and functional, but broke under light use!","I was pleased with the holster. It was functional and it would accommodate the large battery (all of the holsters don't work with the large battery). But after a week or so of light use, the holster cracked and broke where the swivel attaches to the holster. As my son also had one break (in a different place), I guess I won't be replacing it."
3,"Nice Try, but Stalin's Dead","Richard Lourie has done some excellent research and recreated Stalin's persona quite well, but this book is sorely lacking in certain areas. The story focuses on Stalin's hate for Trotsky and his process to eliminate the exiled communist, but it skims over too many of the details of Stalin's other projects. This is a ine tactic, but it makes the plot too thin. Also, while the narrator is well informed about Stalin's life and is a megalomaniac, he is not believable as the monster who ruled Russia. It is a good, quick read, but is more style than substance."
5,The Entire Series Is Great!,"This series, Only Rock 'N Roll is just as good as alot of the Rhino collections. All top hits, all original versions by original artists, no remakes or remastering whatsoever. The rest of the series, Only Love, Only Country, etc. are also among the very best. If you're just putting together collections like this, you'll have it made in the shade. A great collection for those who only need decade by decade hits, they range from the 50s to the 90s. For fans of real oldies but goodies, the 50s series is a great way to start. Highly recommended."
4,Against the rope review,It a really great movie if you loved to watching powerful women and boxing all together in one.
3,Pretty good.,I bought this movie because Meg Ryan is one of my favorite actors. I think this a good movie to watch when you have nothing to do. I would recommend this to everyone.
1,Unacceptable for serious use,I am a graphics professional (architectural rendering and photography); bought this monitor in a pinch hoping I could get by with it for a while but found it unacceptable. There is no viewing angle at which the display shows a uniform brightness. I will pay the $75 restocking fee to return it to CompUSA.
1,Service is among the worst I have seen,"I had this monitor 6 months and it went dead. I called Samsung and they said no problem it is within my 3 year warranty they will send a replacement. Nearly a month later, I still don't have one. I have been getting the total run around from Samsung. They keep telling me they are backlogged, just what I want to hear when being without the use of my computer for a month. I have called numerous times and they promised a supervisor would call me back each time, but none ever does. I have never seen customer service this bad, the monitor was great when it worked, but after this experience, I will never buy another Samsung product"
4,Good value,"This monitor is replacing an old Apple display that finally gave up the ghost. Between the two, I prefer the Apple, but this is a lot cheaper than a new Apple. I've had good luck in the past with Samsung monitors, as well.There is one dead pixel. Nineteen are required before Samsung will replace it. There is also a flickering, which rolls up the screen periodically.On the plus side, it's not expensive and very adjustable. It's bright and the colors vibrant.You do have to run it in its native resolution, though, or you can't read anything onscreen."
2,"Ok for the price, viewing angle issues","This monitor may be ok for most folks for the cheap price of half grand. A few people have commented (and given 1 star) for its viewing angle issues. Colors change on the monitor even with the slight change in angle. Colors will appear darker or brighter even 1/2 inch apart.However, the overall thing is good for casual usage. I play games on it - which is a bit more than casual, it looks fine, but I am not happy. The real bad thing is they don't tell you this is a problem with the monitor."
1,Samsung Warranty Repair,"Samsung is not on my Christmas list!RMA support and repair of existing Monitors is 1/2 star and attempts to escalate were denied.Overall support is poor at best. I decided to give ASUS VE248H - 24"" a chance making Sansung'slack of support a non issue."
5,Excellent Monitor the second time around,"The first monitor I got was defective, the buttons didn't work, and it frequently shutoff for no reason. Sent it back - easy, no problem. New one is super, great color, just needed dialed in. No problem whatsoever with the angle of view, as some other reviews stated. The adjustibility of the stand is awesome, I am very pleased with the monitor. No dead pixels. As a Mac owner I am very pleased, with how well it works with my Mac"
5,Work Light,"My boyfriend asked for a light for Christmas and so after some research and good reviews on this one, I grabbed this one. He was very happy with it - he really liked the long cord and that there was a plug in on the light for additional items."
4,A Romantic Collection - Van Cliburn (Audio CD),"This is the third of Van Cliburn's recordings of a collection ofshorter piano pieces, the others being ""My Favorite Encores"" and""The World's Favorite Piano Music"". I am a Van Cliburn fan partlybecause of his piano playing, and also because of his generosityin holding piano competitions for the young at Fort Worth TX.I have dropped the rating by a star simply because I was not in tune with some of the pieces in this Romantic Collection. Otherlisteners may very well elect to raise the rating to 5 stars."
4,"Who cares about French language this is America, where's our english version","This has to be the greatest show that ever aired on Nickelodeon. This show was produced by a French/Japanese corproduction, that's why their's a French version.In the year 1532, a Spanish orphan named Esteban searches for one of the seven cities of gold in the new world, hoping to find his father in the process."
3,"Oh, well...","Do not take me wrong. The tales in this book are really great, but the Batman that is portrayed there does not match the acual one, in psychological profile. There is much light for a set of Dark Knight adventures and, in addition, Bruce Wayne shows himself a lot, a thing Batman does not usually do. However, there are some great stories, as Thomsen's An Unauthorized Biography, Murray's Bone and, best of all... Palmieri's Best of All. If you are a true ""batmanite"", you may not like this book, but if you are for a good reading and don't care about a lot of ""pre-pre-pre-crisis"" stories, you may enjot it."
1,The worst CD ever created...,"As a lifelong musician, I have never been so disappointed in a recording as I am with this CD. For a choir as talented and prestigious as the Vienna Boys Choir, I am embarrassed that they would choose such an undertaking. I'm not one to dislike pop music, but this is horrible. I thought the worst music ever created was Madonna's ""American Pie,"" but this takes the cake."
4,The Male Ideal:,"This is a great ""underground"" era of photography that needs more documentation & archiving. There is so much more to know and see of this age when things like this were forbiden - yet so popular."
1,ring flash,"i bought this product via internet from Turkey, to use with my canon d500+macro lens during my dental works. I bought it from Amazon but it was a third party company 47th street photo. But this product never reached me. I bought 5 items at that time, only this ring flash never reached me, even i wrote so many times to Amazon customer service and to 47th street photo, and even there is a Amazon quarantee, but never reached me!!! so i cant make review about this ring flash!!! i paid for it but never get it!!!"
3,I had David E. Long as a professor,"I took a Civil War history course with Dr. Long at East Carolina University. He made us buy his book, and I found it and Dr. Long to be extremely tedious and boring. I sold it back on buy-back day for a buck even though it had cost $25. There are many other books about Lincoln that are much better. I, too, and Phd in History now."
2,Win XP SP2 driver doesnt install on both USB ports,"I agree the directions are pitiful, the CD has no drivers but for 98 , diablotek has nothing about any products like this, only video cards. Using my top USB port it wouldnt work, using the lower one it was recognized and works fine. Odd.PC is dell laptop 600m with windows XP pro SP2."
3,Italian Boater,Amazing hat. Beautifully made in Italy. My son has received numerous compliments (almost daily) on the hat.
1,"Too many predictable, self-serving anecdotes","This book is filled with story after story of how the author is able to achieve her daily goals by being in the right state of mind.These anecdotes take up most of the book and I found them very predictable and not very inspiring.Other than the stories, there are some Seth/Jane Roberts inspired insights that are worth reading or studying.On the whole, there is way too much fluff that detracts from the content of this book."
2,"Mostly Form, No Method","I got very little from this book. I kept reading because I thought that she was going to get to some better information and deeper insights, but it never happened. It's mostly personal anecdotes, and the only concrete advice she gives is basically to think positively and believe. I think I've heard that a few times before. The best parts of the book are the Seth quotes; I should've just bought a Jane Roberts book."
5,I wish Apple did not discontinue these.,"I picked up a g4 cube off of eBay, and so far I'm loving it! This is perhaps the greatest Mac of all! Sexy, sleek, powerful. I love this machine! I have it hooked to a 32"" HDTV in the guest bedroom for those nights when I have guests over.If you get one of these, you will not be disappointed!Highly recommended!"
4,Macs Are Worth It,"11-27-10.I bought this computer almost 10 years ago and it still works! I had to get a memory upgrade along with an external Zip Drive (remember those days?) and an external memory drive for my pictures and movies. Yeah, it pretty slow now but that's mostly because as new programs are created they become more and more demanding of the memory and processor; but it still works. Can you say the same of your Windows PC???DON""T get a Cube now; get a Mac Pro. I just bought a new one and I expect it to last me another 10 years. As for my Cube, I think I might turn it into a novelty fish tank."
4,Great TV two years ago,"I have had this TV for some time (two years or so) and have not had a problem until a few days ago when I purchased my first Blu-Ray DVD player. Up until this point, my standard DVD player and cable box worked splendidly with the TV but when I hooked up the Blu Ray in the same manner, I got no picture and no sound. I later found out that the player was capable of 1080P output where my TV is not. Fortunately, the Blu-Ray will work with component video cables, but I found this quite interesting since I did not know this when I bought the TV."
1,If I had only known,"I saw this film in the theater and like it. So i decided to buy the dvd for my dvd collection. I am obsessed with quality video and audio and this DVD [STINKS] ! I own an HDTV and the picture quality of this DVD is unaceptable. It completely ruined the dvd for me. I would expect more from speilberg.If you don't care about video quality , then this is a decent movie, not fast paced, not an action flick, but an original story with good actors.JQ's"
2,terrible film,"I expected the first time i saw this movie to see a film with great special effects,a great plot,and great characters.I got none.The special effects in this movie are not good they same like some cheesey 70's style special effects.Also the plot is horrible,it doesn't even make much sense,a family adopts a robot-boy then decide to get rid of him when their son comes out of a coma,terrible.Then he goes in search of a ferry.I mean that is pathetic.Also i hated the characters in this movie,like Jude Law who plays a robot gigolo,and that Haley Joel Osment is pathetic as a robot.This is definitely one of Spielberg's worst if not the worst.By the way i found the ending to be qiet gay.The only reason i am giving this movie 2 stars is because the dvd is loaded,but that doesn't mean buy it stay away from this."
1,dont waste your time,must have been one of the worst movies i've ever seen...and i've seen a lot of them
2,The most drawn out child abuse in the history of creation,"Yes it is a technically well done film, and there is all sorts of neat stuff in it. But I found myself growing weary of the relentlessness with which the main character is made to suffer. And the little teddy bear robot is really annoying."
4,This film tugs at the heart strings,"Steven Spielberg outdone himself with this one. I started out viewing it with no preconcieved notions about the film. When I finished, I found that the film stayed with me. It is an excellent story that has many surprises. I recommend that everyone see it and try to understand the underlying message (don't want to give the story away)."
4,This is a Sci-Fi DRAMA... and that's OK!!,"OK, a lot of people went to see A.I. thinking it would be some kind of sci-fi action movie or something, being this an unfinished Kubrik Project I did the rigth thing, went to see it, not knowing what to expect from it. the result? I liked it very much it has that old sci-fi novel feeling, when the conception of the future and things to come was just something to aid the story, and not something to carry the whole story or to base the story on. I liked very much the way it's so similar to Pinochio (even in the end, the original Pinochio, I mean). This DVD has a bunch of extras interesting to all of those who like FX & mainly CGI. Well worth the buy."
3,Okay...,"A.I. is the wonderfullly-directed story of a boy who's actually not a boy but a robot. He is abandoned by his, what you might call ""foster"", mother because it looks as if he tried to kill his ""brother"". He meets friends who are like him on his journey to meet a Blue Fairy (who he believes can grant any wish) who he hopes will lead him back to the woman who abandoned him.This film tempts critics to call it a masterpiece. The direction is gorgeous, the visual effects are dazzling and the scenery is an art-lover's dream-come-true. The film lacks a bit in plotting and scripting (and, let's face it, endurability), but you'll definately be enchanted by the fantastic acting of Haley Joel Osment and, once again, Steven Spielberg's ostentacious directting.I'd recommend this film to you, but I would question even the hard-core Sci-Fi fanatic's ability to view A.I. more than once in its entirety. I liked it, yes... but I didn't love it for some reason."
3,AI: An Interest,"The Good Things*Very nifty, imaginative special effects.*Some strong imagery and motifs.*Storyline, strange though it is, is fascinating. I love the last 30 minutes; I've always wondered what would happen if alien archeologists visited Earth...*The characters are all right. It is interesting to see how the main character starts as an inhuman robot and gradually morphs into an emotional being.*Good music.The Bad Things*All of the fairy-tale paralellisms are a little weird (but could also be a good thing, depending on what you think).*Very long and slow-moving.It's strange, but emotional and thought-provoking. Fans of sci-fi and Spielburg should check this out at least once."
1,Save your money and your time.,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am not too upset about wasting [money] on the DVD, as the video and sound quality were excellent. I do feel like I wasted precious time by watching it. My fiancee and I were overjoyed when the little robot boy finally found his Mommy - not because it was dramatic or tear-jerking, but because we knew the movie would soon be over. This movie [is not good]!"
1,Yuck!,"I really wanted to leave the theater and ask for my money backseveral times. The wife didn't want to, though. When it was all over she said she wished she had. The short story is interesting -- if if had been a 30 or 40 minute movie it would have been great. But instead it was plodding and idiotic. Don't be so darn smitten next time Stevey..."
3,"A.I. - All Shadow, No Substance","A.I. has its points, but they are not that developed.David the android boy goes from one adventure to another, none being fully fleshed out.The special effects in the movie are good, the acting very good (particularly on the part of Jude Law, who should have been nominated for an oscar), the ending touching, but the movie just doesn't cut the mustard.SUGGESTION: Make a movie out of the make-believe mystery that was made up on the web-sites loosely related to A.I. - Artificial Intelligence."
2,Don't buy this guys.,I rented this movie hearing all of the great reviews expecting a pretty good movie. I watched it for a little while then turned it off after 45 minutes. I just couldn't get into it. I think Haley Joel Osment is a good actor but to put it short...
3,"Interesting Idea, could have been done better","The story idea is very interesting, but it could have been done a lot better. It gets a little too sentimental and strange at the end. The acting performances given by Jude Law and Haley Joel Osmet are outstanding. The film is well worth watching for their performances alone. The visual and special effects are stunning. The dvd contains some interesting documentaries."
5,Brilliant,I thought this movie was brilliant. Haley Joel Osment just amazed me with his performance. He's got to be the best child actor of all time. There's no doubt he'll be winning Oscar after Oscar when he's older. I think the story of A.I. is the best I've seen in a long time. This movie is completely unpredictable. One sad note is their portrayal of New York City over 2000 years from now. The World Trade Center is still standing. Sadly that wont be the case 2000 years from now.
5,Steveley Kuberg,"This is Spielbergs first true SF Movie. And he does his best. It is the best MOVIE I have ever seen before!If you watch the movie twice, and watch it twice you shal, you will see many elements that we saw in Kubricks movies, mixed with elements of the director and artist Steven Spielberg. And that is what makes this motion picture so special.It is propably the flick with the greatest HEART that hollywood ever made. Let us not forget the IMAGES, let us not forget the SOUND, let us not forget the LOVE"
1,"Steven, how could you?","Steven Spielberg + Stanley Kubrick + ILM + a great cast... This movie should have been fantastic. And, to be fair, it does start out that way. However, as the plot moves along, it quickly goes from fantastic to mildly interesting to vaguely silly to PLEASE GOD MAKE IT STOP. This is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The fact that it was directed by Steven Spielberg, widely regarded as one of the best in the business, makes it even more of a tragedy. I realize there are a lot of people who think this movie is magnificent and wonderful. Well, to them I say this: That's what the townspeople thought of the Emperor's New Clothes. I think this movie is absolute garbage, and a must to avoid."
1,Worst Movie Ever - Avoid It - Wish I Had Been Warned,"This movie was audio/visually stunning. Unfortunately I didn't follow my instincts and turn it off after 30 minutes... the film should have been named ""Abuse of A.I. Children and the Failure of Humanity."" I'd compare it to someone who hates porn, and is suddenly faced with a well made porn film, and then throw in children, and a couple close relatives... very disturbing. I highly recommend avoiding the film!"
1,"I think, therefor I slept",Thank goodness Mr. Kubrick was spared the pain of having to view this stinker. If you value your sanity avoid this at all costs.
1,What a JOKE!,"Ok, just because a director is popular doesnt make their movies fundamentally good. Is a good piece of art good because of the hype behind it or because of its cohesive / coherent message and content? This movie displayed so very little cohesivensss and coherency. It looks like pieces stollen out of 4 to 5 movies most people have already seen (wizard of oz and 2001 to name a few). Unless you just want to see this for some occational special effects and dont care about things like content, Id recommend passing on this one."
4,Seek and ye shall find,"Spielburg and Kubrick are kindred in ""AI"". Conceptually Kubrick presents questions like ""What is it that makes a human conciousnous?"" and ""What difference is their between love and adoration."" These conceptual questions could never be presented by Kubrick for this film (as many times as he tried). The Project was missing one ingredient.Spielburg and his time tested genius for showmanship new the angle. He presents the film from the view of a child. He shoots a film in which he actually seeks to define, Love, Life and humanity. The audience has to come without pretense in order to hear the voice of the future and the cry of the past."
1,Senseless Waste Of Two Hours,"I'm sorry, but this movie tops my list of time and money wasting movies. This was a movie that lacked that ""certain something"". Haley Joel Osment did a pretty good job, but that was about it. The plot was thin, and after a while you have no sympathy for any of the family members. It was so bad that I just had to walk out. I think that the best part of the movie was the little mechanical teddy bear that the boy toted around wherever he went. All in all I think that Steven Speilberg was trying to make a modern day ET, but it horribly backfired into a plain, boring, and flat out bad mish-mosh of lines simply composed. I love Steven Speilberg but this movie just fell terribly short of my expectations. Think twice before buying it!"
1,HORRIBLE,"The first half of this movie was really great, but after that it turns into a senseless Disney film. It's horribly obvious where Kubrick left off andSchpielberg comes in.Then, there are those robot things that looked exactly like the aliens in Close Encounters of the Third Kind!This film was one of the most dissapointing I've ever seen in my life!It could have been great, the premise was there, but it was ruined beyond redemption. I'd give this no stars if I could."
1,DRIBBLE,"This movie is terrible. I hope that I can save one person from seeing this movie with this review. The plot makes no sense. The movie drags on forever. Everytime you think the pain will end, it continues. I do not want to give anything away, but the ending is one of the stupdiest endings of all time. Please save yourself the money and skip this one. E.T. and 2001 were never supposed to be morphed into one film."
1,Please Don't Watch,This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. It's amazing to me how anyone could stay awake for the entire film. Please do yourself a favor and pass on this one. There are so many other things one could do with 2 hours than watch this movie.
1,Worst Movie of the Century - An Embarassment...,"DO NOT waste your time, or money. Long, withered and withering. Boring with absolutely no point. Speilberg should hang his head... I wish I'd wasted my money somewhere else..."
5,My favorite movie of all time!!!,"I have seen hundreds of movies, they are my life, I own 60 DVD's and almost 100 VHS's. And after watching all of them I can definitely say that A.I. is what i think to be the best movie ever made. The stroy is so complex and clever. Nothing is left undone, it's perfect. A lot of people say that they hated it but a lot of Americans are stupid and close-minded. They want everything given to them on a silver platter. They don't want to think about the movie or think about its messages. It is perfectly acted and looks great. SEE IT!!! My other faves are Mulholland Drive (or anything by David Lynch), The Game, American Beauty, Princess Mononoke, and tons more."
2,Boring,"Spielberg's die-hard fans or followers will disagree, but this film was boring enough to not watching it till the end. When I was waiting for some better scenes (some action, something interesting), the story came with a disgusting part that made me stop it right there."
2,Should have ended when...,Too bad Spielberg felt the need to add a hokey 'Close Encounters' ending onto the film. The natural end point of the movie is when David realizes the nature of his existence and there is a beatiful and tragic moment. Then there are are at least 3 more endings which depart from the tragic storyline to create a more friendly 'hollywood' ending. The movie would have been more powerful without this ending that explains the motivations of David for those who were unable to grasp the similarities to Pinochio.
5,An Essential Work for Students of American Jurisprudence,"This is simply one of the most valuable books ever written on American jurisprudence. The book has many dimensions: a discussion of American legal realism; a biography of Karl Llewellyn; an examination of LLewellyn's writings and approaches to the study of law (particularly ""The Common Law Tradition""); and still valuable bibliographic references (even though the book was published in this edition in 1985). Twining knows his subject intimately, having studied with Llewellyn at the law school of University of Chicago in the late 1950's, as well as being the principal organizer and commentator on Llewellyn's papers (see his ""The Karl Llewellyn Papers""--U. Chicago, 1968). Twinings subsequent publications also attest to his acute analytical skills; his British perspective on the realists and Llewellyn adds a further valuable dimension to the book. A must read is how best to describe it."
5,great handy reel,I use this everyday and its so handy. so far it works without a problem and think it will last too.
2,Low brow thriller,"I give this book 2 stars because there is a good story there just trying to get out. The basic political premise is a good beginning but as many other reviewers have pointed out the book has many problems, arcane military terms, detailed descriptions of things we suspect Brown is desperate to want us to understand and ridiculous furturistic weapons that are just impossible (a woman wearing an power assisted exoskeleton shoots down a hypersonic missile with a computer controlled rail gun which fires a bolt that in flight is molten but somehow is guided). Somehow the airforce has taken over the role of the marines and army.The characters are superficial and not believable at all. The soldiers and low ranking officers are all highly skilled and work extremely well together. On the other hand the generals are incompetent and hate each other.Brown writes books the way an army drill sergeant would."
1,boring,"this kind of story line (us vs russia) and charachter development (the main charachters are the weapons and weapons systems) went out of fashion 15 years ago. this book is boring, the plot ridiculous, the authenticity incredulous - in short, I might read this book if the cable was out, it was raining, i had run out of wine, the cd player was broken, and it was the only book on the shelf."
4,Most popular in Utah...NO WONDER!!,"I just recently moved from Southern Utah where a fine community theater just recently put on the Scarlet Pimpernel in March-April. I used to work at the theater, so it was a must see. It was a brilliant show, even for our small city. I must say that it became very popular in our theater and everyone rushed to buy this CD after seeing the Scarlet Pimpernel.The music is memorable, and though I easily prefer our cast over this one, I must say, this one is wonderful as well. Definitely something to listen to over and over again. It's just wonderful."
3,Correction: Christine Andreas is the Gurgler,"For those Linda Elder who noticed, I wish to apologize for my review in which I stated that she sounds like Barbara Streisand with a gurgling vibrado. Elder, in fact, is stunningly talented and has an amazing voice. Christine Andreas plays the role of ""Marguerite"" on this version and carries those aforementioned traits."
5,SCARLET PIMPERNEL,"I have a cassette version (yep, a cassette!) of this musical, as I collectmusicals for professional reasons.....I like Frank Wildhorn's music, but the first and foremost reason I bought THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL is becausemy favorite actor Terrence Mann originated the role of CHAUVELIN. His cover of WHERE'S THE GIRL sends little shivers up my spine....wooo! That song is worth the price the CD! Teri"
4,Two out of three leads make this musical fantastic,"Douglas Sills and Terrance Mann are impeccable in their character creation and vocal talent. They cause the soul to stir and the heart to laugh. I could listen to these two gentlemen sing 24 hours straight...and then some.Regrettably, Christine Andreas is less than spectacular. There may be some who enjoy vibrato in excess, but to me it sounded like she was suffering from eternal stage fright, lacking in breath support. I can only stand to listen to ""When I look at you"" because of the music and the words... Andreas is tolerated, not enjoyed.For those who are in love with Les Miserables, you'll find a similar tone and tempo to the songs. And if you ever feel heart sore, listen to ""Prayer"" for empathy."
2,Not worth importing....,"This is a Japanese import (and you can get it somewhat cheaper at the Amazon in Japan if you're able to navigate through the site) and compilation with the majority of songs being SAW produced. Nothing is really special here as all the songs can be found on every other SAW-related compilation. Included in the mix are some euro-dance songs that have also appeared on every other 80's euro-dance compilation. Recycling's nice, if you're trying to save trees, but record companies should really try to put out really hard to find stuff that we all know and love but can't get on CD. A pity."
2,Student Flute,Don't waste your money. It didn't even last the school year. Having trouble getting in touch with the company to have it fixed.
1,Very Disappointing book.,"I was excited to read this book because I enjoy time travel books and have always been impressed with L. Ron Hubbards writing. According to the introduction of the book, Hubbard wrote the story as a screenplay and then Dave Wolverton converted it into a book. Usually, things go the other way and people say ""compared to the book, the movie stunk!"" In this case, unfortunately, the book stunk. I read about 50 pages before I began wondering if it was a pre-teen book. I read 50 more and began wondering if I was wasting my time. I was certainly wasting my time. The characters are preposterously simple and unrealistic. The scenarios they encounter are never set up well and the characters reactions are out of a saturday morning cartoon. The protagonist is a near imbecile and he is by far the most intelligent character in the entire story. Save your time and money, this one misses the mark."
4,A fun romp through time.,"This is not a serious time travel novel, but it is amusing. Its very similar to: ""The Ship That Sailed The Time Stream"" by G.C. Edmondson and reminiscent of Keith Laumer's, ""The Great Time Machine Hoax."" They just don't write science fiction like this anymore. I thoroughly enjoyed it, though I gained no new insights."
2,Poor guide to database UI design,"I'm not sure where all of these 5 and 4 stars are coming from. This book is absolutely horrible at addressing UI design. Half of the book is C code for GTK applications that could have been made available on a companion disk or on the website. And most of Stucky's explanation of things comes in the form of very brief comments embedded within the code. Lots of typos. Lots of butchered examples. No general GUI concepts covered. No coverage of multithreading issues. You're basically getting three non-real-world examples' code bound in a book and hardly any coverage of general user interface design concepts and ideologies. The title should have been ""Beginner's Guide to Using GTK with MySQL and Glade""."
5,Awesome,"I went into this book with few expectations, and I was very pleasantly suprised. She portrays her characters very realistically, and she poses interesting moral questions.I'm not in the age group recommended for this book (I'm 18), but that certainly didn't stop me from enjoying it.I recently read the Narnia Chronicles as well, and I must say, ""The Goblin Wood"" was a refreshing change from the ill disguised propaganda in the Narnia books where magic is a terrible thing, and pagans are obviously terrible greedy people."
3,Good price,This was required summer reading for my daughter. She wasn't thrilled with the book and this particular book has very small print.
5,"Horowitz is amazing as usual, BUT...","Horowitz is amazing as we have all come to expect, but at the time that Mussorgsky's PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION was recorded, recording techiniques had not been perfected as they have today. The rest of the CD is outstanding. If you are a Horowitz fan, I highly recommend this recording."
1,"Don't buy from CellularFactory they are Pentax, thay are Np-120",Cellular Factory sae this as Pentax DL17 Battery for Optio Series Digital Cameras (Retail Packaging) bur is not they going to send you Np-120 Made in China. trust me I can pruve this.
1,Very disappointing....,"I actually found this book in my bookshelf several days after my beloved little dachshund died. I don't remember buying it, but there it was! Anyway, I was terribly disappointed in it for most of the reasons that have already been cited in other reviews.My main complaint is that he effectively dashes the hopes of readers who are not Christians by stating that while God created us and loves all humans and all creatures, only those who accept Jesus Christ as their savior will see their pets in the afterlife. To my way of thinking, If God loves all the creatures He created (as stated in the book and the Bible), He will accept all His creatures into Heaven. To say that God will only accept Christians into Heaven is an insult not only to the billions who are not Christians but, in my opinion, to God Himself."
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed by this book. I had recently lost a cherished pet and this book had recommended. It did very little to comfort.Although I found some comfort in author's belief that our pets may be in heaven waiting on us, there was far too much rambling to get much else from the book. This is not a book I would recommend to a grieving friend."
2,I was very disappointed - expected much more than I received,"This book was quite a disappointment to me. I have had many pets over the years, grieved for each one I lost as if it were a person because to me it was. I, too, am a Christian, as is the author, and had already found the references he gives in the Bible. I just expected so much more comfort than I received. The author just seems to ramble on and on and doesn't quite get to the point that I needed to read."
5,Cold Noses at the Pearly Gates,I bought this book for my sister who has recently lost a 14 year old dog.He was everything to her. This book has soothed her grief and given her hope. Excellent.
5,The BEST!,"This book is beautifully written and was the only thing that got me through the most difficult time of my life. Gary Kurtz's comforting words and explanations of how and why our pets go to heaven were the answer to my prayers. He lays everything out in simple terms to prove his points. But he also includes the most heartwarming stories of pets and their relationships with people as well. This author is the most perceptive I've ever read- he understands exactly what his readers need, especially since he, himself, has gone through the same agony, and gives them great hope and optimism at the time they need it the most. I would absolutely recommend this as the first thing to reach for when anyone undergoes the loss of a beloved pet."
1,Not comforting at all,"My mother gave me this book after the loss of my very special dog. I began reading the book, looking for a comforting story and instead I found the author using the book as a means to spread his own religious beliefs and explaining why anyone who doesn't agree with him is wrong. Rather than find comfort, or smiles, I found myself annoyed at the author's arrogance about his inside knowledge of God and Heaven. I'll look for a better book. Very disappointing."
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this book that I might receive some comfort for the loss of my precious pet and some assurance for afterlife for my present cat someday. I received neither of these as the author rambles on and on about nothing most of the time, cites only a few scriptures in which he doesn't have much opinion on, and leaves me with no hope for animal afterlife. I've read a few other books on the subject and the best one I've found is ""There Is Eternal Life For Animals"" by Niki Behrikis Shanahan. This book details scores of Bible Scriptures that show how much God loves ALL of His creation and proves from these Scriptures that they WILL be in heaven. Most people want proof from the Bible rather than some person's opinion on the subject."
1,Maybe I Got a Lemon,"I was expecting a very bright spotlight that would last a reasonable amount of time before needing a charge. Instead, I got a spotlight that was fairly bright but nothing special, and the battery would start to lose its strength after about 10 minutes. Worse, the battery quit after less than a year.Fortunately, it was still under warranty. It's still sort of a hassle having to deal with warranty service after less than a year of minimal use. According to Wagan Technical Support, the batteries are supposed to last 2 years."
1,Price too good to be true --yes,"All these features for such a low price? Yes, the spotlight was bright, but then the battery failed to take a charge after a few months.I opened it and the battery was giving off a horrible chemical odor.It's in the trash now and I am wiser about buying this company's products."
4,Good and heavy,"At last I found a quality pot spoon like I remember from childhood. I purchased this spoon, along with the fork (to roast vegetables) and the spoon with holes for frying. I think these will last a while. I wish I had these a long time ago rather than a multitude of flimsy/rusting metal and melty plastic spoons. When it comes to the kitchen better invest in quality utensils you buy once ( or once a decade)."
3,Works as advertised,Nothing special or fancy with this product. Lets the dirt fall to the bottom of the water\soap mix when washing your car. I had to trim it to size using snips.
5,Scratch saver,"Well built, low priced. It is a must have when washing a vehicle!Get two and use the 2 bucket method!"
2,Doesn't fit 'any standard size bucket',"The Product Description states '...inserts into any standard size bucket...', however the Grit Guards I received did not fit the 'standard 5 gallon buckets' I purchased from my local hardware store. The Grit Guards, at nearly 10.5 inches in diameter at the top of the guard would only insert about halfway down into the bucket. Looking at the Home Depot web site, their standard orange 5 gallon pail states: 'Holds up to a 9 in. bucket grid', so I'm doubtful that this Grit Guard will fit theirs either. I guess I'll have to keep searching. One final note; the inserts I purchased were supposed to be by StateofNine per the Amazon web page, but the packaging of the inserts I received is labeled with [...]. Not sure if this makes any difference or not."
1,Not so good,"It doesn't really work as advertised because the sediments just don't settle to the bottom of the bucket fast enough while you are actively washing your car. When you try to reuse the soapy water at a later date, it is true that the grime is in the bottom of the bucket, but as soon as you disturb the water by using it, the grime rises from the Grit Guard and circulates throughout the bucket. Also, the Grit Guard is so tall that you end up filling the bucket with twice the amount of water. I went back to the two buckets method, oh well, at least I gave it a try."
1,Large size,"Product description does not contain the size of the item, nor does it state that this only fits 5 gallon buckets. If you have anything smaller than a 5 gallon bucket, this size will not fit."
2,Has everything -- except good flavor,"I've been researching cat food options and was very excited to find this product. The ingredient list was amazing and the price was reasonable. However, not one of my five cats will touch it -- and none of them have ever been finicky eaters. I see that other reviewers have cats that love it, but I wish I had tried it with my cats before I invested in a large bag. Live and learn!"
5,Season 7,This is a gift for granddaughter. She has all the seasons and watches them over and over! Bought seansons 8 & 9 also.
3,too cumbersome to store,"Coming from a summer at the beach and plenty of putt-putt, I thought my 4 year old would love this golf set. Sure, he likes it, for a few minutes every time I set it up. In the interim, I have no place to store it neatly. Santa didn't leave the original box behind and I am not about to add to the cost of the toy by buying a box for storage. Do not buy this product unless you have room in your house to leave it set up."
4,Nice for Relaxation,"This CD provides an air of calm and relaxation for those seeking a break from the rush and calamity of the quotidian. I recommend it highly because of it's cheap price, too!"
5,Inspirational,"Listening to this CD has taught me how powerful the classical guitar is as an instrument of human expression.Thank you, Julian, for enlightening me."
5,Blew me away...,"I cannot agree more with all the positive reviews of this disc. I am a baroque nut and a huge admirer of classical guitar music, and this disc combines the two in splendid fashion. Julian Bream's playing is astounding, especially on the Sor minuet and also the lesser known pieces (to me) by Weiss. Overall, the selection of music on this compilation is great.There is a fair amount of background hiss, as can be expected in an analog recording from the 60's, but the musical quality and interpretation Mr Bream lends to the music here would make any amount of background noise worthwhile."
3,Ormandy's second Strauss album is a bit tired,"Ormandy and the Philadelphians abandoned Columbia Records a few years before he died, and RCA promptly tried to duplicate his entire repertoire. They rushed thints too much, however, and the results didn't turn into bestsellers or notable performances.This collection of eight strauss waltze matches a similar recording, now on Sony, of eight waltzes, mostly overlaping except for a handful. If you compare sonics, the Sony sounds plusher. But the Philadelphia Orch. is sitll a marvel, and Ormandy is still Ormandy--tasteful, a little cautious, and yet masterful at orchestral blending. What tips the balance toward Sony, in the end, is that Ormandy sounds decidedly tired later on. For more enthusiasm from the podium, try the other collection."
5,BEETHOVEN BARGAINS,"I GIVE THIS 5 STARS because it is a great bargain.It is great because it is a 3 CD SET with a inlays and booklet with information.This is a time and money saver,it is kind of hard to these complete quartets at a good price.Not only that the set sounds great with little hiss in the background."
4,Something New For Everyone,"Regardless of whether you are just entering the workforce, or have been working for decades, you will learn something new from this book! It is a quick and painless primer to help all of us reexamine and understand the image we project."
2,Boring,I thought the photography was uninspired. The best photo was the cover shot which is probably why it was chosen. I found the text boring and a lot of the shots without any debth of feeling which is astounding when you consider the subject matter.
1,Cheaper & Cheaper,"These gloves just get cheaper and cheaper. They are nothing like the older Wells Lamont 508L gloves. Smaller, and do not cover your hands at the cuffs. Will just switch to other cheap imports next time!"
5,Russia by America,"This CD of Tchaikovsky has got an excellent quality of sound, and this is very important.Really the Philadelphia Orchestra and Ormandy have done a fantastic work in this album and it shows all the strength of all the pieces and it show also, the tenderness of some parts. In fact, is a great CD for enjoy the real Tchaikovsky."
2,Weak,"An unemployed screenwriter has to help the third-most powerful man in Hollywood get laid? Don't buy it. Even if I could accept the fact that this loser of a protagonist has thousands of gorgeous women in his rolodex, why isn't he sleeping with any of them? More disturbing, why don't any of these starlets recognize Sydney, the head of a major studio, at restaurants or bars? I just didn't sympathize with Heyward, the protagonist, at all. I thought he was a complete loser and struggling to come to grips with being a homosexual. (A 'colorist'??) He is a ""struggling"" writer yet spends the better part of a week doing nothing but planning a party and then, thinking the party is a flop, is ready to plunk down $1,000 for a plane ticket to N.Y. to run away? Sorry, but this plot just doesn't come clean in the wash."
4,"Witty, engaging, clever","This book had me laughing out loud every few pages. It was a fun read -- I was looking forward to each next chapter.You can feel Howard's dripping insecurity, the rut his life is in, the corner he's painted for himself. The characters are all vivid and believable, with the exception of Sidney perhaps.This is not a heavy or deep book -- just a ton of fun and really clever."
1,an ego trip to be missed!,"Groopman, Groopman, Groopman. That's all this book is about. What about the feelings, needs, worries about his patients? You won't find them here. All you will find is the hyperactive ego of a doc who thinks he is always right. Save your time and money--you can get this treatment when you visit your own doctor!"
2,Others Do It Better!,"With so many mass market books for laymen written by medical doctors, it really is necessary to choose between those authors who are merely writing about their own practices and the problems they encounter (medically, morally or ethically) and those who are also wonderful writers -- who use their own experiences to paint a broader picture of the human condition. I find Groopman very much in the former category (good doctor but mediocre writer) and people like Sachs and Nuland in the latter. Also, there is an elitism in Groopman's tales that is off-putting."
5,Halloween HA-HA-HAs,"I love this DVD. The episodes I liked include the Johnny Bravo episode where he meets Scooby-Doo and the Eds' first junkyard adventure. There are a few funny lines in some of these episodes, too. For example, the ""Cow and Chicken"" episode where Chicken misreads the eye chart and Courage's ""incantation ritual"".Do you think they will make a Valentine's Day DVD ? If so, then the first one would have the Johnny Bravo Valentine's special and two of the Eds' episodes involving the Kanker sisters; and the second DVD will have the Eds' ""Hanky Panky Hullaballoo"" and two of Johnny Bravo's episodes. Just a thought."
1,Throw up flavor?,"I tasted these for the first time today... I am not a picky person, but this bar caused me to gag and I needed to rub the excess of this bar off with a nearby napkin. It really reminded my of acidy vomit."
3,Not as delicious as you might expect,"Love Larabars! Thought you can't go wrong with chocolate and mint, but these don't quite work as well as I would have hoped."
1,So bad I spit it out,Tasted horrible - like chemicals. Sorry I bought a large box that I had to throw away because I would never eat another one.
2,"Cherry Pie ok, Choco Cherry not so much.","I have food allergies, and while I am looking for a Chocolate fix, I think this will take a bit to get used to. The Cherry Pie is quite good, and tastes like the center of a fig newton. The Chocolate Cherry, however smells like vinegar, and while at first the flavor is fine, it soon turns into bitter cherry, a bit of a rum flavor and then you guessed it, a strong vinegar like after-taste. I can get used to it, as frankly I have no other options due to milk and soy allergies, but some sweeter cherries and maybe some organic molasses in the mix would not hurt, maybe a bit of almond oil for added sweet flavor. Next time I will try the plain chocolate as I hear they get good reviews.Over all, The Cherry pie gets an 8 out of 10, but the Choco-cherry gets a resounding 2."
1,Tastes like cardboard,This stuff is terrible. I got one for free and couldn't take more than 2 bites before pitching it into the trash. Do not try this stuff if you like to eat.
5,Yum,"I recently discovered LARABAR and am in full addiction mode. I love most of the flavors. Chocolate is one of my favorites. I wish they had more mixed boxes as 16 of the same flavor will wear me down. If you get a chance, try to Cashew flavor and the Chocolate Coconut Chew -- they're delicious. So far the only flavor I'm not a fan of is the banana -- the consistency was weird."
5,Great Movie!,"This is definitely a movie to add to the home movie library. It it so well done from every aspect...acting, scenery, costumes, and storyline. It's one of those movies that make you feel good to watch and inspires you to do greater things in your own life. Definitely an A+."
5,One of My Favorites!,"I've loved the bagpipe rendition of ""Amazing Grace"" for so long that I knew that I had to watch this film. The life of William Wilberforce during the 15-year struggle to end the slave trade in England was quite poignant and emotional, especially at the time when the parliament finally approves this hard-fought legislation. Michael Gambon's speech in commemoration to Wilberforce (in attendance at the time) was especially emotional for me. Of course, what could be better then ending with ""Amazing Grace"" played by the piper of the Black Watch?"
5,Heroes,Great movie! I could watch this over and over and never tire of it. Everyone needs to watch this movie.
5,Great movie.,"I've bought several copies of it for distribution. True to the text, shows the humanness of a great man who did much for the Lord and for suffering people."
5,Well worth seeing!,This video is both very informative/educational and inspirational. We need to be better informed about the seriousness of the subject of the story. It was a dark time in our history.
4,Amazing Grace-A solid historical drama,"This movie is about the struggle to end the slave trade in late 18th century England. What attracted me to this movie was the cast(Ioan Griffud, Albert Finney, and Michael Gambon). The movie shows the parliamentary machinations and the persistence of Wilberforce to abolish the slave trade in Great Britain. This is despite personal and health problems.The film is a personal inspiration showing that determination and patience will yield positive, long term, change. The film was cast well from the lead characters to secondary characters. Rufus Sewell did well as Clarkson, serving as the Devil's Advocate for revolution. Toby Hughes, as the Duke of Clarence, portrayed the old guard.The film switched back and forth between two time periods. Sometimes, this was confusing. I would have liked to see more of Albert Finney as John Newton.The final scene with the bagpipes and Guards palying ""Amazing Grace"" was moving. Overall, this is an enlightening historical movie."
5,Amazing Grace,"I love this film for many reasons, and I use the movie in my AP classes to show students the power of a man or woman's perseverance to a cause in which he or she believes. The video was reasonably priced and of good quality. I am extremely pleased with this item."
5,Excellent,"This was a great movie. It doesn't have much comedy, but you don't really go in expecting that. The flow of the movie is awesome though, and the climactic ending leaves you feeling good. Amazon Unbox download was really good, no problems with the video quality."
5,Better than history but it is true,"The historical account of the people and events is more than entertaining and interesting while being factual and true, what you would think is an impossibility."
4,"A moving picture, in every sense of the word","This is a moving picture, in every sense of the word. It's the sort of film that can move the viewer - and not only emotionally, but also in terms of moving a person to action. Stellar performances, meticulous costuming and historical detail - the makers of this film do all those things right. If I have any criticism, it's that it's a little slow-moving in places. It also may be a little difficult for those unfamiliar with the historical background to make sense of the plot. Skimming an encyclopedia article about the British abolitionist movement ahead of time could improve one's enjoyment of the film - just to become familiar with some of the names of key players. This is in many ways an important film, precisely because this stirring story is too little-known today. The abolition of slavery was that rarest of political occurrences: a popular movement to bring moral values to reform society - and a successful one, at that. This film is a must-see."
4,PSB does it again,"This is a nice combination of material. The beats on the ""Somewhere"" remix and ""Red Letter Day"" remix are killer and rival the beat to the open sequence of Blade. The new songs are great, well up the B-side standard that PSB has come to be known for. Delusions of Grandeur is a nice surprise. If you are a fan, especially one like myself who must buy everything that PSB puts out, you won't be disappointed. Well worth the price."
1,Bad Binder,"I ordered this binder because it seemed like it would be heavy duty for the use I needed it for. I was really disappointed when I got it. Not only was the one I received damaged, but the quality was really bad. It looked like it would fall apart after just a few uses. For the price, this is not worth it, unless you only want to use it once or twice (not typical for a binder). I found one for a quarter of the price I paid here at a big name store, an Avery Heavy Duty, which will serve my purposes. Save your money, get Avery."
2,NOT FOR MONSTER FANS LIKE ME,"This is a difficult one to review because its all build-up to the final reveal and some will like it and others will be thoroughly disappointed. Right away I must warn those looking for a monster book that this isn't the typical monster-on-a-rampage book that one might expect. Most of the action takes place after the few attacks and the story mainly focuses on how the news of a possible monster on the loose affects the town and its sheriff. Me, I'm a monster fan. I want to know what the monster is/looks like and I want it to make many appearances and be the source of much gory mayhem. This is more of a mystery in the vein of an ""X-files"" episode (""Quagmire"" comes to mind). Therefore, the writing was good, but I'm not a fan of the story or the resolution."
3,A less-than-thrilling-but-competent mystery with a twist.,"There's nothing ""wrong"" with Bonegrinder. There's just not that much that's right with the book either, unfortunately. The clues are obvious and the conclusion anti-climactic. The several passable subplots are refreshingly well executed and thoughtfully different in nature from the main focus, but they virtually overshadow the main plot."
4,This is what handhelds are for.,"I bought this game not too long after it came out. I'm still playing it. If I take my PSP and only one game somewhere in anticipation of a little time to kill, there is a good chance that one game will be WTF.If you've read this far, you know that WTF is a collection of minigames. My personal favorites are Buddha's Quest (a string of turn-based-RPG-style battles, gleefully ripping off the 8-bit era Dragon Warrior/Dragon Quest battle system), Cliff Race 2000 (stop your car closer to the edge than your opponent; for some reason this game reminds me of Saturday morning cartoons) and its 2-player variant, Private Number (a Mastermind-type game, except instead of guessing colored pegs you're guessing the last four digits of a girl's phone number), and Caddy's Quest (move around an infinite golf course picking up golf balls and the occasional sea turtle egg).And no, I still don't have all the trinkets. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go pick up some golf balls."
1,Save your money ...,by spending it on other EBTG albums . this one is a disappointment. Try their first album EDEN or Walking Wounded - both offer a much better starting place.
4,Love it!,"I have not had time to knit a project from this book yet, but it has several adorable patterns that I can't wait to start! All of the patterns are something that could be made for a new little one. Also, there are matching booties, and little animals to go with the outfits which any baby would love! Can't wait to finish my other project so I can get going on these!"
1,New York rock and roll Ensamble,this group is lame and has no idea about Rock & Roll. if you want an albumn to make you appreciate good R&R then listen to this tripe.
4,The best on offer...,"There aren't many Danish language books available in English but this is the best that I've seen. It has a good balance of conversational Danish and theory, presented in units of a good length so that covering 1 per week is achievable. Each themed unit contains 3 or 4 dialogues followed by relevant vocabulary and grammar points. It does make a reasonable attempt to cover pronounciation despite some of the other comments on this website. You definitely need to use it with the CDs though."
5,True to history...,"This book has long been a favourite of mine. What makes it exceptional is Penman's ability to read actual primary historical sources (sources dating to the period about which she writes) and to construct believable characters which jibe with recorded history. Her characterizations of both Henry III and Simon de Montfort ring true from this standpoint. Although the story is more sympathetic towards Montfort, she does not shy from presenting his faults in a realistic manner. She then builds a believable story around historical fact, one replete with accurate details from the period she portrays. I'm a doctoral student in Medieval History specializing in the thirteenth century, and from basic facts to costume and food, Penman paints a vivid--and accurate--picture which brings historic figures to life. I've recommended this book to students who wanted a take on the period besides textbooks."
5,"Provocative, unsurpassed historical fiction",Penman writes accurate history in story book fashion with fictionalized dialog and feelings of her characters described from available historical evidence. She inserts imagined participants appropriate to the story line. All- in-all Penman writes with a skill few writers possess and keeps the reader turning pages.
4,A man before his time,"I enjoyed the second novel in the 'Here Be Dragons' trilogy as Sharon Kay Penman's portrayal of Simon de Montfort is excellent. He was a very complex character and yet Penman does an excellent job of making him a protagonist worth reading about.Personally, I did not enjoy this novel as much as the first- 'Here Be Dragons'- as I became very attached to the protagonist of that story, Joanna. I also became attached to Wales and the Welsh characters and I was a little disappointed that this second novel did not focus upon Wales as much as the first (although I know the final novel 'The Reckoning' once again returns to Wales).I found that this novel improved as the story moved on, as the significance of Simon de Montfort's thoughts and actions became apparent and his legacy revealed. Penman is a very intelligent writer and I enjoy her concepts regarding medieval Britain."
5,Excellent Story,"This is the first novel I have read by Ms. Penman, but it definitely will not be the last! I have read little of this era, except for multiple Bernard Cornwell novels. She did an excellent job in describing a very complicated story with an even more complicated cast of characters. I wonder if she needed a score card to keep track when writing. I can't wait to start my next Penman novel."
5,Almost Too Good to Be True,"The book, that is. The stories and pictures are just unbelievably warm and beautiful. I often read this short book cover to cover during Chanukah--one sparkling little gem a night. Just perfect for adults and, I'm sure, children, too. In fact, I can't imagine anything nicer than to read these to a kid on Chanukah. This book is the perfect gift, to yourself or anyone else. And if you can find yourself a hardcover copy, then you're *really* in luck."
4,"Wonderful fun, with lots of tongue-in-cheek humor","This movie combines the best of English character actors with a riotous story of an ""assasination corporation."" The only unfortunate part is the implied sex scene between Diana Rigg and Oliver Reed in Venice -- his seduction of her isn't terribly romantic. But their byplay in the rest of the movie makes it worthwhile -- she's perfect as the ambitious suffragette fighting to get ahead. Telly Savalas makes a wonderful villain, and he and his henchmen (especially Curt Jurgens as the manic German assassin) are fun to watch. It's a great movie for the whole family (the sex scene isn't really) -- a British dark comedy handled by capable performers."
3,"Very good book, however...","After reading Butterfly, any sequel was bound to be a let down. Had I not read Butterfly first, I would have given Stars a higher rating. It is definitely a wonderful book with an exciting storyline, but in this reader's opinion it just doesn't compare to the original."
5,Stephanie Plum Better Look Out!,"Fans who've gleefully followed the adventures of Stephanie Plum will flip over this story. Sofie, the heroine of the story, has a little more...shall we say ethnic zest? She's Greek to the core, and loving every minute of it. And I won't even mention the dog...you just have to read the story to find out! Hilarious and yummie fun!"
4,Sofie Matropolous,OK but very wordie. It got very tedious after awhile. It seems like she is trying to be another Janet Evanovich
2,Total Stephanie Plum Ripoff,It made me cringe as to how close this was to Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum Novels. Shame Shame Shame!!!!! Go find your muse and write something ORIGINAL. Sheesh.
2,Like Stale Coffee,"This book had great potential, but seemed to sink about halfway through the story. The story is about Sofie Metropolis, a Greek girl who has gone against the family restaurant business and entered into private investigations. In this story, she's on the trail of a cheating wife, a missing dog, and a potential murder. I didn't like Sofie as a character - she wasn't funny, or smart, or pretty, and seemed to lust after someone for no apparent reason. Her familial background, and descriptions of foods are probably what kept me reading as long as I did. I made it 75% of the way through the book before deciding that I just didn't care about Sofie or her exploits. You can tell, without a doubt, that 2 different authors are writing this book (which they admit to), because the writing doesn't 'flow' from chapter to chapter. Very unimpressed - the book was sort of a Big Fat Greek Wedding takeoff, but not even close to as funny or charming. Read at your own risk."
3,Rather unfocused but entertaining,"I was in search of an updated how-to book on Negotiation, but instead found this book to be a set of Herb's essays on various points in negotiation. Nothing wrong in that, but if you are looking for a robust, updated Negotiation framework, then this book will not provide it for you.""Getting to Yes"" still remains the very best Negotiation primer you can read. After that, read the other books to fill in the details into the conceptual framework established by ""Getting to Yes""."
3,Trying hard to not be cheese with minimal survival...,"When I got this I had never heard of DJ Venom (I think I know why), after hearing a few sample's of this it sounded good. He's trying hard to slam beat to beat but has many times when there are unecessary skips and gaps in transitions, beat jumping, and just too many damn lyric sample's. The general beat is alright, however if you have been into any Tidy Trax sets and UK hard house,you may understand that great hard house is NOT this. If you enjoy cheesy hard house with filler and not much talent, than this is for you!"
3,Expected better!,"To start with I would like to say that I enjoy Queen and Paul Rodger's music very much! The complaints I have with this product has nothing to do with the artists or the live show put on by them. My complaints are the following- the sound quality of the audio cd's is not good in my opinion and also nobody told me that the dvd would not play on a regular dvd player! You have to have HD or Blu-ray hooked to an HD TV in order to watch the dvd. So I spent money on a dvd that I was looking forward to enjoying but, now can't watch. This is no where on the packaging or the product info on this site that I can see. It just says DVD on the packaging! Anyway, Queen and Paul Rodgers still ROCK and hopefully I can enjoy watching this concert in full on someone else's TV!"
5,Common Sense from Two Practicing Professionals,"At last, an updated, readable reference on sales promotion from two consumate pros!Promotion remains one of the most misunderstood of all marketing disciplines. The team of Smith and Schultz provide a logical framework to help the novice or the old hand intelligently plan their sales promotion programs.What you see in the title is what you get in the book. Straightforward, common sense counsel. The authors take their subject quite seriously, but (fortunately for the reader) don't take themselves so seriously that their book fails to entertain, as well as inform."
3,"Meals, Migration, and Modernity, Tagore to Rushdie","""After the Irish Bengalis are the greatest Potato eaters in the world"".Mr. Ray's scholarly research comes alive in the book with memoir and little tidbits about Bengali food. If you are interested to learn about educated migrant communities in the U.S and how food plays a role, this is a must read. Although, the book focuses on mostly the migrant's from West Bengal, the author brings other cultural aspect such as Italian, Jewish as well. He also provides a good insight on some cultural identity issues and shows the relation of culture and food. He mentions the issue of gender role in Bengali kitchen. However, it would have been nice if he elaborated little more about that. Overall, A well writtten and researched work. I enjoyed reading it and learned a lot."
3,it is ok,"Works as described. But - do not use if mounting will be subjected to any amount of heat, like direct sunlight. Heat (above 120F ?) will soften adhesive and the adhesive will separate from mountings. I have not used it in normal indoor temperatures (65-80F) so have no comment on that."
5,Wonderful and safe for your dogs!!,My two pugs LOVE Newman's Own Organic treats! These are the only treats I've ever bought that haven't made them sick. I feel very safe giving these to my beloved dogs!!
2,"It's okay, but don't use it as a beginner's book","This book says that it requires no prior experience, that's wrong. The book is too advanced for a beginner. Also, I feel that the author's explanations are very confusing and I always get messed up with a lot of different concepts. I recommend getting some other CS1 books."
2,Not that great,Just got the phone on monday and I am returning it for the i850 the phone is slow really bad screen display...overall I'm kind of upset about it
3,Sizing runs small,"I love the style of these shoes, but the sizing ran on the small side; I would advise people to order a size larger."
5,Well rounded C++ Book,"This is not for a beginner as stated in the forward. I was hesitant to buy a ""Bible"" book, but this one is great, covering all the important aspects of programming C++ on a Windows platform. My favorite thing is the coverage of C++, including Win32, MFC, ATL, WTL, .NET (MC++). If your looking to write more than ""Hello World!"", then grab this excellent book and let the well renowned author, Tom Archer, take you for an adventure.I read Tom's other book ""Inside C#"" and it was excellent as well.His books are to the point without fluff."
3,Takes Forever to Dry,"Apply extremely thin using a cotton swab or ball. Do not use the toothpicks that come with the kit. Let dry for one to two days. KEEP IN MIND that the paint is supposed to bring detail to the picture and not create a totally new one, so use the paint sparringly, and if it takes more than two days, you basically used too much paint even if you think that you didn't. Works well if used correctly."
4,You should read this book!,This is a great book... A great start to my second favorite series. I was so surprised and amazed by what happened at the end!!!
5,An Excellent and Beautiful Story,"I have been recommending this book to all of my friends ever since I read it! L.B. Graham has woven a magnificant and refreshing story that binds the reader to the world of Graham's superb characters. Like The Lord of the Rings, I was totally captured by the storyline. The characters are so realistic, with faults and weaknesses, fears and hopes, obsessions and desires. This book is well paced and exciting. The ending is rather shocking, but when I finally read the second book, Bringer of Storms, the ending of this book made more sense, and in its entirety, it is a masterpiece of fantasy!"
2,Ugh,"Boring and trite. I just didn't like this book. I wanted to, but the writing was mediocre, the character development was not so good, and the evil agents were just boring. There wasn't any tension in the book. I will say that the ending was pretty surprising though."
4,If you like Christian fantasy,"A very good book! I'm more a fan of the classic fantasy (Lewis, Tolkien)which is why I gave this 4, not 5 stars, but as far as modern fantasy goes, this is probably my favorite. The allegory was simple and clean, not overpowering; after the prologue, it disappeared almost entirely. The story captivated easily, and I'm very glad to find where the characters act and speak sensibly by modern standards, not another Shakespeare wanna-be whose dialogue you cannot follow. If you've gone through the Lewis and Tolkien (that I so adore!) I would definately reccommend this!"
3,Could have been better,"Being a devoted fan of Joyce Adams, my expectations to this book were great. Unfortunately, they were not fulfilled.The book stills gives you that good feeling inside while reading it, in addition to some funny incidents...."
4,Leapster in spanish,"I bought some leapster games las year but my 3 years old did not understand the game, but this one in spanish he really likes it, even tough he got an DS nintendo he does play this game. And the game really make kids to learn"
1,"Update - Now I know how they perform, or don't","We have not yet tried these filters, since we ordered them when our last original filters were put into use, but they are very much less dense than the originals. We are unsure how they will perform compared to the originals. Will submit another review when put into use.Update:After putting these replacement filters to use, we find them unsatisfactory. When we realized we weren't filling our humidifier nearly as often, we checked the filters and found them to be partially dry. They just do not absorb the water like the original ones, and even running at the highest level are not putting enough moisture into the air."
3,"TALK TO THE FILTER, CUZ THE HUMIDIFIER AIN'T LYIN!","I gotsa humidifier, and I was be usin' dat lots cuz the air was dry, know whudi'msayin'?I be looked at the old filters, and it had white salt 'n'sheet all over it. I told my main: ""You gots another beech who be puttin' salt in my humidifier?"" He said nah, and he was trying to tell me that there be salt in da tap water that got filtered out in da humidifier.I kicked dat main to da curb, and I bought me somesa deez new filters, but there starting to be salt in there, so I complained to my landlords, sayin they can't be pumping ocean water into my projects."
1,B-Tribe? B is for Bad >: b,"I s'pose if you're actually into Spanish softcore p0rn0graphic soapoperas then you might enjoy this. I found it shlocky, saccharine and all in all totally mundane. Don't play it while you're driving. You'll either fall asleep or intentionally steer into oncoming traffic."
1,Flimsy,"Very flimsy....couldn't hold a 12"" paper plate. I only gave one star, because the system requires I do so, but if the system would allow, I would give no stars."
2,You get what you pay for.,"While I can't argue with Joanna Daneman's generic endorsement of teaching youngsters to play rhythm instruments, I have to wonder if she actually has experienced this specific product.I have, and I can tell you that mine has a dull sound that instantly bored me and a couple of kids. I've tried numerous times to find the sweet spot, but I'm convinced there isn't one. This is the kind of beginner instrument that turns people away from further exploration in music."
5,It's a home workout ReVolution!,This is leterally a paradigm shift for home workouts! The focus is on the bodies function in daily living and the results are more than inspiring. Everyone that completes this workout feels different no matter how long you have been working out.Get more info at:www.tracielong.net
4,Wish it had even more,"While this book is geared toward setting up elderly parents near you, I think it could be useful for other types of families as well, such as multiple couples who wish to live together or multiple adults who wish to live together but still lead separate lives. In most ways, this is a book about adding an apartment onto your house. The plans are rather dull to look at and a lot of the advice is rather commonsense but they are a useful place to begin research if you are interested in such construction. I wish it had examples of houses and suits created by people today though -- some more realism to the entire book and some good ideas of how such an arrangement might work between families."
5,Thank You!!,"I received my purchased as promised in the confirmation email and as described in the advertisement. Great condition as it is an extremely difficult purchase to locate. The seller wanted to make sure I was 100% pleased, I am. Thank you!! I recommend this seller to anyone that located an item offered."
3,Uneven story with far ranging ideas.,"McAuley is becoming one of my favorite authors. His ""Red Dust"" is probablythe best thing he's written. ""Fairyland"" is good, but not great. It containshis strong style of prose and attention to detail, but the perspective shiftafter part-one is ineptly handled. Part-one introduces a complex main character,and an interesting environment. Part-two, introduces a host of disposable charactersand 100 pages that add nothing to the story. It took an act of will to stay with thebook. Fortunatly, we get the main character back (albeit about 10 story years later).A simpler architecture would have been more effective, and told the storymore concisely."
2,Chilly creativity,"McAuley works up familiar dystopian SF tropes (balkanized first world countries, climatic disaster, virtual reality, etc., etc.) with great skill and seemingly endless invention but not enough feeling. I kept reading, wondering what was going to happen next, and wondering why I should care."
5,Great!,Wonderfull series for emergent readers. ESOL students can participate in social studies in a comprehensible way. Thanks!
4,I love it!,"This drum was a surprise for me, it's great with all its features but little heavy for me, I wish it's carrying bag was rolling!"
2,spin ashtray,Ash tray is nice for helping contain smoke odors but the spin mechanism is cheaply made and wore out very quickly.
2,Not All That,"The tool is made in Taiwan and looks and feels like it. I received the hole punch and found it was damaged in shipping. Two of the cheaply made punches were collapsed in from the shipping box hitting something. For what I paid for it isn't worth returning. The remaining punches punch holes pretty good now(hence the 2 star rating), but I question how this tool is going to work as it ages. The brass anvil on the punch will most likely dull the punch dies quickly. The rotating punch selector works well. The punch came in a piece of crap plastic pouch that was already tore and was basically garbage. If I was a professional or an advanced hobbyist I would not purchase this item. This is NOT the best hole punch on the market."
1,wrong text,"The advertised book is not what you receive on Kindle. Instead, you get one with a similar title by Jung."
2,Good for young people,Contains very basic information. Might be helpful for someone who has just started to think about a career in law enforcement.
1,Blah.,"I confused this movie with the 2006 release of The Covenant. I still went ahead and watched it, and it was a complete waste of my time. Edward Furlong drives me nuts. There is just something about him, his walk, the way he delivers his lines, that just really bothers me. The plot is prety thin and the acting isn't that great.If you're desperate for a movie then I would consider it, otherwise, don't waste your time on it. I'm usually pretty lenient with movies, especially B movies, but this one is definitely not a ""winner"" in any respect."
3,"Just ""Okay"" Like the Others w/o Stabler!","This was a good episode, but to be totally honest, SVU is not the same without Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni). He brought a lot of character to the show and when he left, it lost something special. The new folks just don't cut it, and its going be tough for Olivia ""Liv"" Benson (Mariska Hargitay) to keep this show interesting without Stabler's strong character by her side. It's getting boring to keep watching."
4,don't miss elliot stabler,"i think i got so weary of elliot stabler's same old-same old week in and week out that i, surprisingly, don't seem to miss him this season. I've watched every episode of every season, including this one. The two new detectives are fine but, frankly, I would be happier if they just used Ice T more. Belzer too. I've always thought those two weren't used enough.the olivia role is fine and mariska is doing fine with it.as to this episode it involves a couple who have just driven into NYC. they claim their baby was hijacked along with the car. the police immediately suspect that one or both of them has murdered the baby instead. instead of doing the predictable plot arc with this story, I was surprised to discover that there was a rather new plot twist I hadn't seen before. So this episode was quite good."
2,Available at Amazon: Not Worth it So Far,"I think Dick Wolf is spreading his talents too thin, both with CSI and this new season of SVU. He is a genius at writing all these tales based on real issues, but the end of Season 12 (""Wet""} re: soda companies stealing/buying rights to limited water aquifers is too close to the idiocy going on now in NYC and elsewhere. Season 13, Episode 1 did not entice me at all to watch the next episode, although I probably will try again."
5,Life Changing Tool!!!!,"Fantasticly written and picturesque, this one just grabs you and keeps you going cover-to-cover. Utilizing the tips within, I have met dozens of beautiful women in just a few short weeks, including my current girlfriends. I recomend this one to all single and loney guys. It worked for me,it will work for you!"
4,Literally life changing book for me,"After buying this book and working through the figures, my husband and I determined that we could live on one income after our baby was born.Why do we think we have to have two incomes to survive? It's because our existing lifestyle choices necessitate the additional income. Bigger house? Two brand new cars? Designer clothes? Stereos, appliances, toys, etc. If you think you need a big, brand new house and fill it with a lot of things, you will need two incomes and then some.The main lesson I learned from this book is the high cost of an additional income, especially after having kids and incorporating daycare expenses.Read this book with an open, objective state of mind and it can work for you, too."
4,Jack Frost,"CD works great, my son loves this movie and we enjoyed it over the holiday season this year. Thank you"

2,Corny,"This has to be one of the top 5 corniest movies of all time. The movie tries to have comedy but it doesnt. Then the father dies and returns as a snowman. Thats just freaky. Your dad dies and he returns as a snowman and you hang out with him., Your hangin out with a dead guy! The movie alone is boring. The weather is getting hot and the boy takes him to the mountains. Big deal. For a good holiday laugh and movie get Home Alone or A Christmas Story."
2,Aims at the heart but glorifies death,"Sad movie for the adults, okay special effects for the kids. Unfortunately, to me it seems to give the wrong impression of death. People do not come back after they die to help those they love cope with it. My kids like it because of the snowman, but I can't watch it anymore because it disgusts me like that Robin Williams movie about the afterlife did."
4,Snowdad,"Imagine if your deceased family members could come back to life - but as your favorite Christmas character! That's what happens inJack Frost, where Charlie's dad (Michael Keaton) comes back to life as Jack Frost the snowman. In his new, snowy form, Keaton becomes a better dad than he ever was in life.Michael Keaton makes a convincing snowman (although an even more convincing musician). Even though the film was made over a decade ago, the special effects for the snowman still look pretty decent. This makesJack Frosta heartwarming Christmas movie for kids and families."
5,Touching Wintertime Story,"I listed this as a ""wintertime"" story because it is not necessarily just about Christmas but about the magic of love. Michael Keaton once again does a fantastic job as a reincarnated Snowman who helps his son adjust to his untimely death on Christmas eve. Fantastic story with a great cast. Heartwarming and touching. Don't miss putting this in your Christmas movie collection. It is a ""must watch"" for us every year."
1,horrible,"This movie is lame. So stupid, I feel like asking someone to stand on top of the empire state building and throw bricks at my head one by one while I'm on the ground. That would Be Awesome!"
1,I would have given a rating of 0 stars if I could,"I thought this book would be an informative treatise on the topic of Candida, how to test for it and how to treat it. Instead, I found myself being ‚Äútested‚Äù by a questionnaire of symptoms/medical history with some abstract point system. Just being a 40+ woman with an average medical history put me in the ""serious"" stage of candidiasis.I have to question the validity of a book such as this since the ""cure"" it promotes is nothing more than a pumped-up sales pitch for this man's products. And they don't come cheap! I can't speak to the effectiveness of the cure, but I am not ready to drop $... on a cluster of unproven products promoted by the ""healthologist"" who created them ....P>I can‚Äôt recommend this book."
1,This book provides very few useful tips,"The law school I attend suggested books to read before attending the first day of class. This wasn't one of them. I now know why.The book provides very few (and I mean few) useful tips for first year. The tips it does provide are pretty useless. You will have enough to do in law school without attempting the strategies he suggests. I'll give you four tips if you are attending law school in the near future (for free): 1)Buy study guides geared to the text the teacher uses(emanuel's, blonde's, etc.) 2)Get into a good study group 3)Study 4)Get outlines from second years 5)Don't buy this book."
2,Yoga fan,"This dvd was recommended by yoga instructor. However, I find that the filming of the instruction was focused on instructor talking rather than actually showing the asanas."
5,The best Kmax record.,"Kevin Max has a powerful and well-trained voice. Colorful and filled with vibratos that makes every song a unique experience. The lyrics of this CD are perfect. And the refined taste for the arrangements gives us an amazing listening experience. The cover version of Bob Dylan's ""When He Returns"" is mind blowing. Always respectful of the original, but in this case with steroids. His compositions are very personal and deep. For example: ""Platform"" represents an eternal question: ""Why me?"". ""Your Beautiful Mind"" is a resemblance of God's creation on relation to the human behavior. ""I need you (The End)"" is the farewell song for a love gone wrong. ""Confessional Booth"" is the catharsis for our inner troubles and our self-complains. This record is simply perfect."
5,INVESTING WITHOUT FEAR - OPTIONS,"THIS BOOK IS AN EASY READ, WRITTEN BY AN INVESTMENT ADVISOR THAT KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING. I NO LONGER HAVE FEAR TRADING STOCKS AS I ALWAYS HAVE OTHER INVESTORS MONEY TO HEDGE MY POSITIONS. THE CHAPTER ON MARGIN IS WORTH THE PRICE OF THE BOOK. YOU CAN GET IT ON AMAZON.COM. THE BOOK HAS BEEN UPDATED IN APRIL 2003."
1,Not at all what I expected.,"This hair dryer is the worst ever! I was using it in the bathtub, and it fell in. That was six months ago. Now that I'm out of the hospital and have re-learned how to write I discovered a warning on the cord that says not to use it in water! How would anybody know that? It's for DRYING your hair, why wouldn't you use it in wet places? It really should have a bigger warning on it. Only a genius would know not to do that."
1,terrible text,"This text is horrible. Its disorganized. Has many run-on sentences and you'd have to reread the whole sentence to figure out what you were trying to comprehend in the first place. Not at all concise. The examples or horrible to follow. One has to flip back and forth through pages to figure out what exactly its talking about because the paragraphs changes topics in mid sentence...literally!! It begins on one topic and jumps to an entirely new subject and then ends with...""we'll discuss this topic later in chapter so and so. It uses languages that are not every day words and leaves you confused and unable to understand. Very difficult to understand. I am now looking for a better nursing research text that is actually stimulating and can teach."
1,Questionable content,My 8 year old read this for a school biography assignment. Told me he was confused about why Leonardo was thrown into prison. The book talks about how he was accused of having homosexual sex and how there was a special group which was formed to round up people accused of sex crimes. Thank you scholastic - I had been wondering how to broach the subject of homosexual sex with a boy who still covers his eyes when people kiss on TV. Don't buy this for your kids unless you want to have this special talk with them.
1,NOT a children's book,"This could have been a great book if chapter 4 had been left out. There was some great and easily accessible information that would make it an enjoyable read for children from ages 9-14.My daughter chose this book for her biography book report. She was extremely upset when she came upon the adult theme of homosexuality and didn't want to read past page 36, the 1st mention of the allegation. And to the previous reviewer, Colleen, you should have been more honest when reviewing...his alleged homosexuality and the investigation is the theme of chapter 4, not just page 38 as you said. This was very upsetting to my 10 year old daughter who didn't want to read about that kind of stuff. Why must children have to deal with these issues? This book is definitely NOT for middle grade age students! I'm very disappointed in the author's choice to include this in a children's book."
1,disappointment,"Would not work, right out of the box. The company's service URL doesn't work, emails bounce, and their web domains (.com, .org) are no longer active. I'd be embarrassed to offer this item in a garage sale."
4,CITY OF THE DAMNED,"Tarl Cabot was a warrior of Gor--the world that earth could never see. Normally he was a proud and mighty warrior, but now he was bound for Port Kar, the only city with no home stone to give it a heart. It was a city of reavers and looters...of outcasts without allegiance. Merchants and pirates stalked its quays beside the beautiful Sea of Thassa. Tarl Cabot was headed for the sinkhole of the planet, a teeming den of iniquity. And that was no place for an honest warrior from Ko-ro-ba. But he was no longer Tarl Cabot, the warrior. Now he was only Bosk...a miserable slave."
3,A Solid Effort!,"The good news is that this tome provides tremendous detail about its subject matter, retail banking in Europe. The bad news is that you have to really want to know a lot about this specific subject to penetrate its lack of organization and awkward writing style. The information is abundant, particularly about the past, although the book doesn't include insight about the future. European banking is full of threats, opportunities, reversals and challenges. It is subject to revolutionary reshaping by major political and economic events. Popular books don't tend to get written about such esoteric subjects unless they are post-mortems on disasters. Given that, we think this academic if thorough entry may be indispensable to people with a real need to know about the subject."
3,I thought it was fine.,"The book is a solid one, a good read. My only complaint is the feeling that Kubert hasn't brought anything new to the whole gangster thing.Read it if you haven't read a hundred other mob books."
4,Great product,"This product is wonderful, the only downside is a few times after a couple hours if I end up rubbing my face it will flake off. But its only happened a few times. I love these natural products."
5,"A funnel, yes.. it is","In these cases, when all you need is a cheap plastic funnel it all comes down to price. There are no frills here... you pour things through this into other things... end of story.If that's what you're trying to do, I highly recommend this one"
2,diappointingly small,"This item was disappointingly small. I know that I assumed and what that means, but I think that they should have had a small side note on the description that this would be best used on a Vespa. However, I will use it for small liquids."
4,Is not a large funnel.,"It's a funnel, not much else to tell. It can't quite take a full quart of oil without overflowing; you'll have to dole it out pretty slowly. The tip of the funnel is smaller than I figure is necessary for automotive purposes (unless you have to add oil via the dipstick hole.)Other than that, it works fine."
2,"Some signs of life, but is the corpse just twitching?","Colin Davis's Sixties recording of the Mozart Requiem has lasted for forty years as a perfect example of the middle way in this work. It uses a mid-sized orchestra and chorus that produces a romatnic but not Victorian sound. As an alternative to the lumbering verions of the past and the anemic ""period"" readings to come, Davis's account satisfied on all counts. As so often happens with him, this later remake (1990) with the Bavarian Radio Symphony is tired and sluggish, a pale shadow of Davis's earlier triumph. The chorus is large and recorded in a cavernous space. The solo quartet shows ability but comes nowhere near the earlier vocalists in naturalness and simplicity. There are occasional signs of lfie, but overall this performance is its own requiem."
5,Beautiful,"Such a touching DVD. I already had the book, and saw the slide show on Youtube. The musical arrangement is beautiful, and I love knowing the story behind it all. I would highly recommend!"
4,"Great ""facts"" video...",Video and narration well done and professional. It's a good addition to your railroad video collection. Gives you alittle more respect for the railroad community.
3,Front Buttons Don't Work,"We bought this scanner because of the ADF for imaging all our office documents. However, the front buttons don't seem to work. I believe it's because it's connected to a computer with Vista. Canon doesn't have an updated driver to be compatible with the new OS. So, I guess we will have to wait until we are able to use the front buttons. We tried re-installing the driver, but nothing happens when we press the front buttons. Other than that, the scanner does the job using the software that comes with it."
5,WITTY & INSTRUCTIVE,"This is a fascinating book!I liked the many illustrations dispersed throughout the text.The author's sense of humor added entertainment to an enlightening read. I especially liked the courtship section. It is amazing that women send signals so many times before men respond.It shows dense we men are.After reading this book, I doubt I will never go to another social occasion without consciously recalling the lessons of Dating Younger Women.I hope some publication like Playboy, Vanity Fair or Men's Health pick up Kevin Doyle for an article elaborating on the excellent points he makes about men and women.How to Meet Beautiful Women"
1,Blue Poly Tarp 12' X 14' wasnt what was mentioned,This tarp is only 11.4x13.6 not the 12x14 Like it stated.It was also missing some of the aluminum grommets and one area was ripped. Definitely not as specified
1,crap,Blue Tarp had a hole in the middle plugged by some yellow putty substance; wasn't worth the effort of returning the item.
1,A Very sad piece of work,"It appears that the more Mr Cummings writes, the worse his pamhlets degrade. If you have an intense interest only in how to locate the cheapest noodle stands and flea invested ""Hanoi Hiltons"" this book is for you. If you desire to learn something of the culture, people, ethnic minorities and diverse locale of Laos, please look elsewhere. This book was of very limited use to me in a country that already has so little written of it."
5,Great! Great! Anointed! Album,"Well, it is hard to believe this is Anthony's first album. This cd sounds like it was done by a veteran in Gospel Music, like Fred Hammond. The Lyrics are superb. Songs like Restore me and Just like You speak directly to me. These songs are definitely what young and even older converts need to be listening to in times like these when almost everyone is falling away. Excellent music selection as well!! You don't need a rapper to get a clear message to the youth."
1,Very very very stupid movie,Heck! I couldn't even understand the film that much except it was about a guy stealing things for his girlfriend. This is one very stupid movie. P.S. Why's it still in print?
3,"""Good enough"" small cordless","I got this phone specifically because it is an older 900 Mhz model and won't interfere with my wireless network - It does it's job well enough, but has a few shortcomings:- Cheap boom headset / mike: I'd have expected slightly higher quality. You'll want to replace this at some point.- No battery meter on the phone: This frankly annoyed me - what re-chargeable phone doesn't have a battery meter? Since at any given time I don't know what the charge on the battery is, I'm constantly re-charging it, which will ultimately diminish battery life.- Belt clip - a small detail, but it's awkward. You actually mount the phone upside-down and the clip ""pivots up"". The plastic clip also comes off the phone fairly easily.This is the kind of phone that I would have loved if it went through a 2nd or 3rd generation. As it is, the sound and the phone are ""good enough"", but not spectacular."
5,My personal favorite...,"This is my personal favorite of the several recordings of this symphony available. In addition to the magical feeling that Previn gives to this movie score cum symphony, Sir Ralph Richardson's narration is magnificent."
4,"Good Stories, Terrible Art","I ""got out of comics"" a few years before these stories were first printed so I'm enjoying them now. Peter David wrote great stories but the art is horrible. McFarlane cannot draw to save his life. It looks like a preschooler drew these books."
4,"Good, but a copy of the Official All Japan Nihon Kendo Kata","As mentioned previously in the other review you get every Kata you need, yetI do not know why this studio is claimingthis is their title as this is actually just a copy of the""official"" All Japan Kendo Federation Nihon Kendo Kata producedby the All Japan Kendo Federation."
2,Eleanor: In Her Own Words (American Playhouse) [VHS],"This is major boring stuff! Good luck trying to stay awake while watching this film! The whole film has one actress/actor giving a long drawn out speech, nothing more."
5,"beautiful, conversational, fun, incredible","I found Frank O'Hara's collected poems in my college's library when I was a young girl of 17 and they really freaked me out. They flipped all my notions of ""poetry"" all on their heads, and I was intrigued and fascinated and turned on and plugged in and electrified. A great poet. Everyone should read this. His ear for diction and amazing wordplay amaze me each time I read anything he's written."
2,Stomach ache and nausea,"I tried digestive enzymes a long time ago but had stomach pains, and I decided to try them once more. After I took the first pill, an hour or two later I had terrible nausea and stomach pain. Im not sure why, but these just dont agree with me. However, that was just my experience. Your results may vary, but at least be forewarned."
4,CD-ROM drive,"I just wanted to comment on the issue raised by the previous reviewer about whether or not this disc plays in computers- I bought this CD, and it DOES play in my computer's CD-ROM drive, so it apparently works with some computers and not with others."
5,Good book,"I enjoyed reading this book.Some of the other reviews complained about the way the book discusses on the lifestyle of the people who lived in Arts & Crafts houses and during the time. But I have an engineering mentality, so I need to know the function before the form makes any sense to me at all. The book describes both the space and the purpose of the space used by these rather-formal people. Hearing about servant's quarters and such is a little strange in this time, but it did drive the design of a house -- so it's an important part the architecture of the time.My copy is used, but it was well worth the money I paid for it, and we've been able to get a bunch of neat ideas for Arts & Crafts style tweaks to our modest 1950s house."
2,Monster Home Series LCD PowerProtect Review,Monster did not plan well for the use of this part for wall mounting of a LCD TV. On a wall mount these is limited space between the LCD and the wall. The orientation of the surge protector needs to be rotated so that the LCD plug has room to connect.
1,STAY AWAY FROM A1NUTRITION!!,These people will take FOREVER to get you your product---they take your money immediately but good luck on getting your stuff. They refuse to even acknowledge your attempts to contact them as well.Go somewhere else to get your products---they aren't even close to being worth the trouble.
3,"historically accurate, not baseball accurate","This book was good from a historical perspective, and gives some very interesting aspects about baseball in ST.L and durring WWII, but like the other reviewers have mentioned, there are several ""baseball things"" that are mis-stated or incorrect. Things like ""RBI average"" etc are annoying, and quite honestly would have been fixed by an editor who has watched some baseball - but did not ruin the whole book for me."
2,HD quality was poor.,Looked like a DVD a lot. Don't recommend if you watch Blu-Ray regularly. It did not look like HD at all.
1,What a waste - read the book!,"What a waste of an opportunity! How shallow this film is. Jackson shows no respect for the original story changing key characters to make the film more appealing to the average American movie-goers. The acting is absolutely dreadful, as is the direction, again proving that visual effects take precedence over quality. The pace is slow, and the sections cut or altered stand out blaringly. How could Arwen be elevated to warrior princess status? Gandalf as a fumbling old fool? Hobbits as weak cowardly morons? The inner struggle of the characters is glossed over as are race-relation building events (notably Legolas and Gimli). Sad, very sad. Wonder what the ""expanded version"" will offer with such poor material in the first place. The only positive is the incredible filming locations!"
1,stinky,hello my name is matthew smith.and i thought that this was a major smellfest by director Sketer Snackson.
2,Lord Of The Rings-The Fellowship Of The Rings,"I was disappointed with my purchase. The DVD skipped in quite a few places, even though it was marked as in good condition. It was my first time buying anything online and I probably won't do it again anytime soon.BUMMER!!!!"
2,"Good movie, cruddy stream","The movie is good, the download stream stunk. We're I to do it again, I'd think twice before attempting the stream from Amazon."
5,Streaming is a good option,"The movie series speaks for its self. I really enjoy the story, if you haven't and may have the time, I suggest you read the books.I like the streaming feature and find it such a great idea instead of buying the disc. This way no matter what I'm using, tablet, cell phone, gaming console or computer, I can watch the movies with ease."
5,Great Movie,"This movie was wonderful. It was not as good as the book, but seemed to go along with it. It was almost exactly like the book, except it was shortened. If you are looking for a movie to go see, definatly go see this.-Stephen (SC)"
1,Read the book (this film gets zero stars),"I actually saw this one in the theater when it first came out. About 45 minutes into this 3 hour thing, my friend leans over and whispers ""Something had better happen really quick, I getting really bored."" Funny funny, this movie can't keep the interest of college professor with a 170 IQ. So much for the visual stimulation...it wasn't even intellectually captivating (but the book was...go figure).Anyways, I was able to make a grand total of 7 trips to the bathroom, and upon return, I found I missed nothing. This film, like the first one, just creeps along, so much so, that I too, lost interest, and didn't really care one way or another and hopelessly waited for an external armegeddon to ameliorate the existence of the characters in this film."
4,Does the job,"Good sturdy ladle...this ladle will last forever...very good quality and very well worth the price. I just don't like the fact that its made in china, therefore I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
3,Harpo Speaks Too Much About Woolcott,"It's only because Harpo is so likeable as a person that I give three stars. Since Groucho never went in depth about the Marx Brothers in any of his books, I was hoping Harpo would provide more insight. Unfortunately, Harpo was very hung up about his social status, and his friendships with the Hollywood elite. Way too many pages are given to his relationship with Aleck Woolcott, and the endless stories of pinochle, croquet, pinchie winchie, etc.The book does provide some interesting history, and what life was like during the vaudeville years. Again, this man probably has to be one of the nicest people who ever lived. He had a great life, and was a wonderful family man.Overall, I recommend the book if you are interested in his personality. If you want to know how the Marx Brothers got along or any other in-depth detail on them, you will be disappointed."
5,Forever Plaid must stay...forever,"Hey, I'm still in high school but I'm finding my self listening to the ""boss"" tunes of these great guys, thanks Forever Plaid for restoring my faith in music and most of all, the kindness in people."
2,"Nice product, but lousy movie",Nicely done package and DVD but it's not really measure up to the hype.Save your money... I paid $35.00 for this.
2,So-so thriller,I agree with the reviewer who said to save your money. The only thing that saved this movie was the cinematography. There are some truly beautiful scenes in Europe. I think it would have been much better without the love story which was not at all convincing. The dialogue between the lovers was predictible as was the ending. Ho hum.
3,"Good book, not long enough","This is a wonderful book. The imagery is vivid, the stories real, harsh yet touching. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in missions, or just opening up your mind to the world and suffering around us. The problem I have with this book is that it is so short. It is 96 pages, several of which are filled with pictures and the font is fairly large. This makes it an easy read, however a quick, easy read. If you order this book (and hopefully you do) just be prepared for a short, quick read. I think this book would be great to read for bed time stories as it is composed of many short stories."
4,A Glimpse into the Heart of God,"Dr. Ted Kuhn, has captured a sense of the ""things that break the heart of God"" in his book ""My Eyes, His Heart."" Penetrating stories of brave, needy people, living in squalor, poverty, and disease fill the pages of each chapter.Dr. Kuhn's writing is sometimes graphic, disturbing, and infused with realism. Each short story portrays the victims of suffering, broken dreams, trauma, or poverty. Included with each story is an application drawn from the Bible to challenge the reader to join him in his search to discover and minister to those with needs that touch the heart of God.Beautifully written, filled with inspiration, and motivation, ""My Eyes, His Heart"" is a poignant call to action. This is an important book anyone interested in motivating the cause of missions, ministry, and Christian outreach. It should be included in every church and church school library."
4,Modern pulp,"The story is fast and furious, but Derrick Ferguson does an excellent job of keeping the reader on track. The main character, Dillon, seems to have a ton of depth to him that I look forward to exploring in future stories. The theme and cleverness of THE VOICE OF ODIN harkens back to the great classic pulp adventures of The Destroyer."
5,WONDERFUL,"A found the name ""William Hope Hodgson"" by watching the japanese commentary with english subtitles to the 1960's rubber monster flick, ""Matango""That film (though quite fun and creepy in a wonderful way) DOES NOT COMPARE with the amazing short story it was based on. But I couldn't find the story anywhere. I read it online and decided that I had to have it. This book not only contains that one, truly great but unfortunately hard to find story, but many others that I've found to be absolutely fantastic.If you like creepy short stories that weave a cloud of atmosphere and apprehension and drop it on your head like a flash flood, You'll love Hodgson's short stories. For the small price you pay, you'll find these stories stick with you right into your dreams and nightmares.Absolutely wonderful."
2,The author could do much much better,"There are some very clever turns of phrase in ""Welcome to My Planet"" and the choice and handling of narrative structure was interesting and masterful. The open-endedness of the 'conclusion' was not completely bad either, insofar as that seemed to be one of the themes of the book (getting Shannon to the point of recognizing all the possibilities ahead of her). Overall, however, despite some flashes of real character, the book feels shallow. The insights to which the psychologist leads Shannon are not earth-shattering, and even though the inescapable banality of Shannon's life seems to be another of the book's themes, the book's presentation of this life never really rises above triteness itself. With a richer subject, this author would certainly be capable of writing a much better book. The journey of self-discovery in this one, though, was too obligatory, predictable, and, ultimately, indistinguishable from so many other 'autobiographical' narratives."
1,couldn't finish it :(,"I was very eager to buy this book but now I wish I had saved my money. I just couldn't get into the story and struggled to finish it, but alas I gave it up. My tip: go to your library and check it out there."
2,Boring and Disappointing,"From the title and the book description, I was hoping Shannon Olson's ""autobiographical novel"" would be witty and poignant, and speak to me, another newly 30-year-old, in a way that was relevant and entertaining. Was I wrong!Instead, this is one of the most DISAPPOINTING books I've read in a while. Olson tries so hard to be funny, but she rarely is, and the few times that she almost succeeds, she repeats those jokes, like a bad sitcom rerun. More important, though, Shannon (or her alter ego)is unlikable, self-centered, whiney, annoying, and stupid -- and I just didn't find my own or my friends' experiences in this book. She/the character fails to gain any meaningful insight, and the whining never stops. I kept reading thinking it would get better, or she would CHANGE somehow, but I finished it thinking, ""And that was it?"" Yep. Not entertaining, not insightful, and boring. Don't waste your time with this one."
3,One of the best flashlights--unless rubber button cover comes off,"This is undoubtedly one of the brightest LED flashlights for its size, and the battery lasts forever. However, the rubber button cover is flimsy, and if it comes off, there's no way to turn the flashlight on and off unless you have a sharp object with which to press the tiny button.Update: Coast sent me a new flashlight when I called and told them about the rubber button cover coming off. Great company!"
2,Not a daring story.,"""Summer of Pearls"" is not an enthralling read, but a misleading one. The dust jacket describes the book to be full of mystery and endeavors. Rather, it was a retelling of events. I finished the book unsatisfied. It's about a fourteen-year-old boy who recounts the story of the most adventurous summer of his life. It may be a good book for a young male reader, but if you're looking for a thrilling escapade, look elsewhere. For male readers under the age of 13 - I recommend; all other readers - I do not recommend."
5,Silent film documentary,"An excellent documentary tracing the evolution of the American Silent Film era. With interviews of long deead Film Stars. Unfortuneately I could only get it on video as its an old series first aired on Thames tv, shame would love it on dvd."
5,Great book.,The photography in this book is stunning and the book is full of great ideas.I did notice that a few of the photographs are of Bunny Williams's house - while studying the photos in Bringing it Home I recognized some of the interiors. Sure enough I got out my copy of An Affair with a House and the dining room and living room are the same.I greatly admire Ms Williams and just thought it interesting that a book about England would include a house from Connecticut.
2,worst one of them all,Man lunicoleone fell off on this one there songs on here with rock beat wtf is wit that and hes pose to be a rapper lyrics are alrite but the beats are wack i think his best cd was a millon words million dollars that one was off the hook
1,This looks awful!,"Maybe I have weird lips, or am no good at putting on makeup, but every time I try to use this product, or others like it, it ends up cracking on my lips, peeling in weird places, and just looks terrible. I've tried putting on with my lips relaxed, stretched, smiling, scowling; it doesn't matter how I put it on, it never lasts long and when I try to reapply it looks like wet paint on cracked plaster. I do like the gloss that comes with it, as it is sheer and mosturizing, but I can buy lip balm if that's all I want out of this product. I bought three of these; two by Max Factor and a similar product by CoverGirl. I used them a few times, was always disappointed, and recently threw them all away. I knew I would never use them, so it cleared space in my makeup drawer for products I will use and enjoy."
1,Where's the romance?,"I prefer my romances to have a healthy dose of reality, so I had no problem with that aspect of POAG. But I had to stop reading halfway through, because I really didn't care what happened to these characters. How could a psychologist not see what a passive-aggressive type she was? When you find the hero's ex more likeable and when the attention veers toward other characters, I'm going to lose interest. Yes, I like to see rules broken-but I came to this book with expectations, and the characters weren't strong enough for me to not mind that those expectations weren't met."
2,Awful Heroine,"I have read the first half of this book, and although I usually force myself to complete a book once I've started it, I have no desire to read the rest of this one.I simply do not like Kate. She is so repressed it's painful. She's mean to Jeff, and she's mean to her kids. There is no way that someone so unable to get along with others or to take an introspective look at herself could be a sucessful psychologist.Jeff is a great male lead, and should have her head over heels in love. Why is there so little ROMANCE in this romance novel?"
2,Don't be Fooled,Don't be fooled by the cute cover and interesting description. I was so disappointed with this one. The story starts off well with Jeff and Kate not liking one another and barely on speaking terms and then slowly builds their friendship and attraction. Then out of the blue a third character is introduced who is supposed to be Kate's perfect man and she starts dating him and falling in love with him. Meanwhile Jeff has realized that he's in love with Kate and he thinks there's something fishy about this other guy. So here I am wanting to read scenes about Jeff and Kate and all I'm getting is Kate and the increasingly suspect other man. By the end I felt like I was reading the screenplay for a bad movie and even Kate and Jeff's reconciliation felt forced and unbelievable. Such a shame because the first half of the book was terrific.
1,Ugh.,"This has gotta be the worst ... I've read in a long, long time. It's worse than what I've ever been assigned in all of my classes put together. The only thing worse than this that I can think of is the Red Wheelbarrow...and that was what, four lines long? Yeah.......it's not worth the paper it's printed on, much less the ink used to print it."
2,Boring,"I thought that this was one of the most boring books I've ever read. The whole Sam and Elizabeth fighting is boring and overdone, enough is enough. I'm also dreading a Elizabeth and Sam romance, since that seems where the writer is headed, I would also find that boring. I think that Elizabeth and Tom need to get back together, but I doubt that will happen ever again. This book also focused way too much on Todd and Dana. Again that was boring, they would fight, then makeup, fight then makeup, I think that they need to live apart. Hopefully the rest of the books will get better. Also the whole Jessica and Tristain storyline was lame."
4,A rapturous edition/addition,"Ian Bradley has done a marvelous job in researching the G and S scene since the end of the G and S copyright in 1961. Each chapter is chockfull of interesting notes on productions, singers and the politics that rage behind the scenes. For anyone interested in the current G and S scene, this book is a must. I was a little disappointed in the details of the American G and S scene, but the rest of the book made up for this defect!"
4,A dark hero and a bride sale????,"Interesting story line that I had not read much about before. The hero (James) has gone off to the war in Spain and when he comes home he obviously has posttraumatic stress syndrome, which of course no one including him understands. At the same time, the heroine (Verity) is being sold, by her husband at an auction in a little town square. One thing leads to another and James ends up buying Verity from her husband. It is interesting to see how things progress. Verity is not made into his mistress instead she is introduced as his cousin, though many know differently.The story progresses as you find out what happened to his previous wife and see how Verity comes to care for the town and those around her. Including the bad tempered James.I enjoyed this story and recommend it to others as not the normal romance."
5,Excellent Piggy for Baby and Toddler,"My first daughter received this as a Christmas present back in 2006. My second daughter is now nine months old and she is enjoying this toy as if it were brand new. Incredibly cute songs and great for teaching counting. It has held up very very well considering the abuse it takes. Babies love to drop in the coins and then take them all out again. Absolutely love it. It's a shame that the ""spanish"" version of this toy is not being stocked/made anymore. I've looked for it high and low to give as a present and have been unable to find it."
4,fast service but.....,came very quickly and in great condition..but it would have been nice if somewhere in the item description there would have been some mention of this book being the same as the author's other book 'the star's tennis balls'. 'revenge' and the other book i mentioned are one and the same..'tennis balls' is the uk title and 'revenge' is the book's us title.
2,"Didn't even try to use, hard to turn","I bought this thinking it would be a nice way of adding oil to my airplane that would avoid making a mess and would be easier than a funnel. However, when I received it and start playing around to see how ""easy"" it would to be use, it was actually not that easy to turn the flow valve mechanism. I even tried gripping with a pliers and working back and forth a while thinking it would losen up from being new, but no such luck. I figured once I got oil on it making it more slippery it would become even more of a challenge which is why I just returned it.I gave it 2 stars rather one because I suppose it will probably work, but I just didn't like the design so I didn't try it."
4,Dampening,"Does a great job dampening! Has the option of a thick, thin, or no foam ring to put around the edge to kill the sound. I have a Regulator on the front though, and it sounds way to dead with both. Might have to switch this out with a clear head."
3,A thoughtful thriller,"The Program tells the story of a disgraced cop who hopes to redeem himself by infiltrating a dangerous cult to rescue a vulnerable young woman. Hurwitz has done his research and writes with convincing detail about the methodology behind aggressive recruitment techniques, offshore financial shenanigans, and some of the more insidious kinds of mind-control. At the same time, however, the cult he writes about is so extreme as to border on caricature. Most of the members of his group are very one-dimensional, and the leader, a sort of personal growth guru gone VERY bad, is clearly a scam artist. That said, as a thriller, The Program is well-crafted and a seductive read."
5,A text book worth reading for fun!,"This is an excellent collection of fairy tales - and the critical analysis is definitely not the dry, boring, academic writing you might expect!"
4,Great Product,I have used this for years in my cat's Litter Robot. It works so well. My car broke down and I needed this badly so ordered it from Amazon. It was there immediately and I did not even have to pay shipping. From now on I will order it online.
5,4 stars get 5 stars,The book was indeed wonderful and comes in handy for a programmer in his day-to-day activities. I am working in Java Servlets for the past one year and I have been wanting to have a quick reference as well a good companion for me.And I have found one today written by the four stars whose names tell that they belong to my Country. I really feel proud for these people have written such a wonderful book. I would urge the publisher to keep these authors always on the top of their list.Hats off to the Authors!!!!!!
2,Extremely funny when it wasn't extremely boring,"For the most part, Mafia had a lot of potential. The jokes were good, but overall, the movie lacked direction, and fell apart. Try to imagine the humor level of The Naked Gun with absolutely no plot.Yes, it was funny, but the ""snooze factor"" is overwhelming."
1,No.,"This was just terrible, anyone could have made a better movie. Great concept, but they didn't even try. It's too bad that this is talented Lloyd Bridge's last movie, he deserves better (though he tries very hard, it's not his fault). Jay Mohr isn't exactly a funny guy. Just DUMB, which is fine if the movie is actually amusing, but i swear to God I only cracked a smile (not even really a smile--a smirk) once during the whole movie, when there was a parade with The Pope on stilts. And I was -drunk- when I saw it and in a very easily amused mood, too. I've seen Goodfellas and Casino probably 50 times, so I at least had hopes there'd be some funny ""in jokes"" for fans of these movies. The funniest parts are in the trailer, and the trailer is only mildly amusing. Don't rent it even if you think it's gonna be ""Airplane"" meets ""The Godfather"". Even if you have no expectations whatsoever you will be dissapointed. Rent this, and you'll hate yourself afterwards for doing it. Trust me."
5,Hilarious!,"I can't believe people didn't find this amusing-- I laughed the whole way through! In my opinion it was better than the Airplane! movies, which I didn't think were THAT funny, so I don't know what was the big deal about that. I don't think this movie is confusing at all either, not that hard to understand. If you're not going to be good natured and laugh at something because you think it's too silly, don't get it and be bored. I recommend this movie to all my friends... and all of them so far have loved it!"
3,"Run, florist, run !!!","If you love the Godfather trilogy, Casino and Goodfellas you really HAVE to see this movie. Although not everything works in this movie there are some hilarious scenes included.After purchasing the Godfather trilogy, I knew I had to buy this one to complete my mafia movie collection, and I am glad I did.I especially like the guy playing the psycho brother (like Sonny in the Godfather). Almost all of his scenes are laugh-out-loud funny."
3,Not bad. Not bad,But not good. It was funny but stupid in the same pridictable spoof. If you've seen one you've seen them all. There were cute Chucky cliches but still it didn't pay off.
3,Short journey through Erdrich country,"This little book is one in a National Geographic series. Erdrich recounts a trip she took with her 18-month old daughter (born when she was in her late 40s) through the Ojibwe country of northern Minnesota and the lakes of Ontario. It's more meditation than travelogue. It is also a peaceful book, unlike her fiction which tends to take me on an emotional roller coaster. It's a quiet picture of Ojibwe terrain with a detour into a very small part of the book world."
5,Powerful and yet sweet,"I agree that this album isn't Daniela's best album. All the same, it's still brilliant. Brazilians can often be heard lamenting the 'decline' of wonderful Brazilian music, but Daniela Mercury proves that this pessimism is unjustified. Brazilian football might be in decline, but Brazilian music isn't! I think that Daniela Mercury is one of the best singers Brazil has produced since Elis Regina. Yes, she really is that good! And like all Brazilian music, the combination of driving, complex rhythm and haunting, sensuous melody is remarkable and invigorating. Saying that this album isn't as good as her others is like saying that sapphires aren't as good as rubies, diamonds and emeralds -- all are very good! I don't believe that Daniela could ever produce something which isn't fantastic. She is a marvellous talent. I love her. When she breaks through into the US and British markets, she will blow everybody else off the stage."
3,not the best example of her capabilities,"Daniela Mercury, ""La Mercury"", the queen of Ax√© music is a chart-buster in Brazil, but this isn't her best album. It seems to have had a lower budget, being earlier. The instrumentation on some numbers is downright cheesy. For the best taste of her capabilities, I'd recommend ""Arroz e Feijo""; it's got a better variety of styles, better musical arrangements, etc."

5,wonderful,I love this album. Jenny has a very rich quality to her playing and it is quite evident here. I also love her Christmas album.
3,"Good Info, Poor to Terrible organization of the examples.","I found the book informative and simple. Good for a beginner, which is its objective. I have one complaint and I hope the author and/or the publisher will read this. In many instances with few exceptions the references to the charts, illustrations and examples require turning a page instead of being able to stay on the same page while looking at the graphic. At first this was a minor irritation, but it grew to be a MAJOR FAILING. Help, please in the next edition of this book put the explanation on the same page as or the opposite page from the illustration or example that it describes."
1,Scratcy and unable to hear,I received the cassettes which I am unable to listen to because they are scratchy.
2,I wish Tom and Elizabeth were back together..,I liked it better when Elizabeth and Tom were dating. I just hate it when they go out with other people! To francine: pleae make them date each other again.
1,junk,"This product is totally a piece of junk. The automatic shut-off doesn't work at all, and can become dangerous if you don't pay attention and just wait for the valve to shut itself!"
4,"Noisy, but works!","Functional, works as advertised, but horribly loud for the size this unit has. Smaller size is an advantage on trips, can be put in trunk without it occupying precious cargo space.4 stars for the utility."
4,It does the job!,"The RP3200 inflates the tire, the automatic feature operates as advertised and the device is easy to operate.At the same time, these observations should be noted:The vibration that occurs when it is operating is such that the device must be held down or it will jump around.The inflation valve goes on easily, but some force is required to remove it. In the process, some air escapes from the tire.The inflation hose and the power cable must be folded carefully in order to store them in the compartment provided on the back of the RP3200.I would recommend this product."
3,Automatic shut-off stopped working,"I bought this two years ago and have used it about 10 times. It worked well the first some times. I compared its pressure reading to that of a nice digital gauge, and it's accurate.The automatic shut-off stopped working after 7th or 8th use not sure, which means it will keep inflating even after it reaches the pre-set pressure. The pressure pointer however will stop at the preset reading because it is mechanically stopped such that one time when I did not watch carefully, my tire was inflated to around 60!"
1,Piece of junk,Own this for slightly more than a year and it just decided to die on me. I hardly use it and is normally use to pump up bikes for my family. Stay away from this item.
4,Great Pump,"I just bought this unit recently for the third time. It is a great small pump, I like it. It pump a bit slow but it does not give any problem except when you finish pumping, it is difficult to detach from the tire valve. If you don't pull it quick enough, then you will loose some air. I believe that the manufacture should read the reviews and make improvement to make a better product."
4,Very useful compressor.,"I bought this compressor to inflate tires in my car. I find it very useful. It is powerful enough to quickly inflate a tire and automatic shut off by preset pressure is very convenient. Built-in light is also very helpful. Even though it is noisy, but price is very good."
4,It's cheap and It does the job,I've used it a few times and it works. It takes about 2 minutes to inflate my tires from 28 to 31 psi. Would recommend this to those who travels a lot by car.
2,Very slow and not useful for much else,I haven't tried this on a actual car tire so I can't comment on that. But I purchased this as a portable inflator for pool toys at the beach. Well 20 minutes later and my child's small pool toy was still only 1/2 filled. I was able to blow up the second by mouth before the compressor finished the first. Also I purchased an wall outlet adapter for use with this compressor but it wouldn't work. The light would work but the compressor just made a buzzing noise. It may fill a car tire in about 4 hours:-(
4,Anticipation,"I have not had chance to make any cards from the book, but I reviewed every page and I am so excited to begin to make these cards. They look very easy and also easy to improvise. I know I will not be disappointed."
4,A primer & a guide,"Books are wonderful bridges for communication about feelings, values, & decisions. Books can save lives by allowing Readers a way to use their minds in a safe, broadening & nurturing way. Literacy doesn't simply mean being able to scribble signatures, read shopping lists & understand highway signs, it means being able to read fluently, engaging the mind in an adventure of self-discovery. Packed into our brains, from conception on, is a universe of experiences, learning to read gives that universe language.SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS ARE BOOKS is a super guide on how to set your children on their road to a lifelong passion. Take the bibliography to your library & recruit the librarians in your hunt for good books.Everything you want to know about what the ability to read can do for your children's minds, when it can do it & how you can help train & encourage a lifelong love of reading.Just remember to add Reading Time to your schedule & the mix."
4,A book to own on your shelf for a specialist,"I originally checked this book out from the library and probably would not have done more than that as a parent of a g/t student. It offers a reasonable list of books for g/t students. However as a g/t specialist, I bought this book because I will be using the information it provides as a reasource for my career. I like that the lists are leveled which so many are not. On the parents side...I wrote down some suggestions for my son's teacher as I was not well versed in young adult literature and she was welcoming of another reasource. I gave it four stars as it was a five star for me, but, as a parent, the average shopper, it would not be as appreciated on the same level."
3,"Nice book, but a little expensive","The pictures in this book are absolutely adorable, but other reviews that sort of imply that it's a coffee table book make it seem that it's more substantial than it actually is. It's paperback and relatively small. Cute and funny (and a tad corny), but at the current price, a little expensive for what you get."
1,"As a fan of the 1st and 3rd films, this one is garbage.","I'll start off by saying this movie is awful. Chevy's just chugging through bad writing and bad jokes in this one. His older age didn't help any either. The kids are terrible actors and I didn't notice one genuinely funny line from either of them. Rusty's just a nerdy douchebag and audrey is just bad. Not even cousin Eddie could save this film, as he was not on par with the original Vacation or Christmas vacation standards. This one is down among the ranks of European Vacation, which is also terrible. I don't know what happened with these two films or how the writer or director thought they were good comedy, but they both stick out like a sore thumb for being the two huge duds of the series in my opinion."
2,It's just like the others!,"My friend and I saw this movie in the theater and we both liked it. Chevy Chase and Beverly D' Angelo are in it, different actors for Rusty and Audre, and set in Las Vegas. Okay, the first one was funny, the second one was lame, the third one was hilarious, and this fourth one had the same jokes from the others. I mean why do they make sequels where they have the same old lines from the first? That's kind of dumb. If I made sequels I wouldn't put in the same script or NOT make the sequel. It would be pretty cool if they made a fifth one but I think they made enough to Vacation. Please, no more sequels! I do like all of the Vacation movies but it's about not to be funny anymore."
1,i expected little and got even less,"the other three certainly aren't amazing, but they've got some heart and they're fun. this one is a paint by numbers dud through and through. there were moments i was actually somewhat embarrassed for the people making it."
2,Can I give 2 stars to Knuth?,"I apologize for giving 2 stars to D. Knuth. Who am I to give such bad rating to him?As I said, I do not feel comfortable giving 2 stars to D. Knuth. Not at all. However, I think that this is not a book at all but a code listing. Even more, it costs 100 $!Looking that example of CWEB[...] usage, I do not think I will ever use it.As an experiment on automatic documentation it is worth taking a look... not to that book but to the CWEB project. However, I do not see the benefit of printing that book. I would rather prefer reading an extension in his Volume 1, Fascicle 1 (Art of Computing Programming).Let's be fair... At least it is interesting to read Knuth code style. Millions times better better than my own :P"
1,Product is poor Quality!,"I have owned 6 -8 curling irons, no of which lasts more than 4 months. They refuse to light after 4 months. A total waste of money!"
2,Picture of product isn't exactly what you get.,"I ordered the barrel of monkeys, not for game purposes but to decorate my son's bathroom which is monkey themed with yellow walls. The picture shows that you get a blue barrel with red monkeys, but what they actually send you is a blue barrel with BLUE monkeys. For most that might not be a problem, but I was wanting the blue barrel with RED monkeys to compliment the yellows walls and represent the three primary colors. I feel that the picture shown should be a true representation of the product being sent."
3,Not the best interpretation,"Richard Stoltzman is a gifted clarinetist, but his gifts primarily lie in jazz and more modern music. Thus his Mozart Clarinet Concerto is somewhat flat and empty. The piece itself is amazing, but I would suggest finding another version of it."
2,Strange and embarrassing,"Listen to Spring mvmt 1. Who came up with the idea to use a heavy down beat at the end of the main melodic phrase? And the canaries singing is eccentric and utterly ineffective. Listen to Summer mvmt 1. My gosh was Alison Bury totally exhausted from a late night party when she made this recording?? Her playing is totally denergizing. Listen to winter mvmt 1. Although Holloway is very good, the orchestra fails to match his playing. The mvmt completely lacks suspense. Overall this recording is uncommitted and a waste of the 4 talented, well-known violinists.I am very shocked at this recording by Parrott since I LOVED his minimalist recording of Bach's Orchestral Suites with the Boston Early Music Festival Orchestra. There are many excellent recordings of Vivaldi's ""Four Season"" but unfortunately this is far from one of them."
5,Fantastic,"I ordered a 50 year old math book from alaska scholarly salvage, and it was in beautiful condition. It arrived in just 5 days, even though I didn't order priority shipping. A small Pillsbury 'spring recipes' pamphlet, also quite old, came with the book for free, which was a delightful touch."
1,Horrid,"Bought a new Compaq PC and S200, took many tries to get it loaded. It worked for about 10 uses, then all I got was a multicolored page. I did all the things advised. Wrote to tech support, got information that did not help. Saw on Compaq opinions MANY with the same complaint. 6 months old and it is worthless at 3 months"
1,advertised as cordless when it is not,"I purchased this item to inflate my bicycle's tires, so I was looking for a cordless tire inflator. This one was advertised as cordless. When it arrived, it turned out that it is not, it only works when plugged into a car charger - I do not have a car. So, I had to return it. The customer service rep was very understanding, though, and acknowledged the error on Amazon's part."
3,Unknown Rebus,"Well written. I didn't get the Edinburgh I remembered but maybe this is more the underside. Very interesting the way the author makes you think about racism. The solicitor guy says "" we are all racist; it depends on what we do about it"". When you read it you will be aware ""we are all tribal; it depends on how we handle it"". The immigration officer is black and a ""Londoner"", another label. Another scoundrel is Irish, a rapist is Scottish and on it goes. There are good bad and ugly in all races. This is my first encounter with Rebus, the detective, and that is a disadvantage. I think I would enjoy him much more had I been familiar with his other novels. This is my fourth or fifth book set in ""northern countries"" Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Scotland. They are not unique and they point out that the ""migration problem"" must be faced. Keeping people in holding centres as described in this novel is not the way. Our society needs to be educated to get along together."
3,OKAY!!! I COULDN'T GET INTO IT !!!!!!!!!,"I RATED THS BOOK 3 STARS BECAUSE I JUST COULDN'T STAY FOCUSED ON IT!!! WHAT I WAS ABLE TO READ ,I WASN'T THAT IMPRESSED!!! I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING BAD, MAYBE IT WAS JUST THE WEEK I WAS HAVING!!!"
5,Good Stuff!,"I live in an apartment complex, where I have to covertly wash my car. It's nice to not need a bucket anymore. It sped the process up quite a bit.I was most impressed with the wax. For each body panel, I put a bit on a sponge chamois and kept wiping (usual amount of time) until the panel was dry. Water beads up nicely now. The wax finish isn't the super-slick kind you get with regular Meguir's, but it's done in about 1/4 the time."
3,First Place is Tops,"Giving Christ First Place is an excellent work book to focus the reader on how to make lifestyle changes for a balanced life - physical, spiritual and emotional. The enclosed CD is a bonus as it shares Scripture and music to reinforce the need for balance. MJR-Georgia"
4,tvz's songwriting at it's starkest,"Yes, his guitar work isn't as great as is used to be, and his voice sounds downright pathetic at times, but every track on this CD is beautiful. I enjoyed this album a hell of a lot more than _A Far Cry from Dead_ because of its starkness. A Far Cry... just seemed to slick for TVZ. I think this album captures the real essence of his work."
3,Simple and to the point.,"A Bento box is to the Japanese what the brown bag lunch is to Americans. And the food inside is the same: simple, easy to make, and cheep. Though this book is short (64 pages), it is easy to follow and is accompanied by colorful photos. The recipes are short and simple to follow, most with five or fewer ingredients. Take note, you are not going to find and fancy or exquisite dishes in this book. There is no introduction or explanations for what you are doing or why you do it. Its only recipes and pictures cover to cover. Almost all of the ingredients can be found at your local megamart with a few exceptions. Pickled plum, cod roe, and burdock might be hard , if not imposable to find, but by my count the things I cant get only eliminated seven or eight recipes. And with two to five recipes per page that?s not to bad. At its cheep price and easy to make dishes I lightly recommend this book."
3,Pretty but impractical,"This book is full of pretty pictures and wonderful looking dishes. The author relies to heavily on the same few ingredients. Does every recipe have to have tofu puff and burdock root in it? Even after a trip to my local Asian market I was unable to find or figure out what many of the listed ingredients were, much less where to purchase them."
4,Bento Boxes: Japanese Meals on the Go,"I was looking for fun & creative ways to take lunches to work, considering today's economic. I wondering what a Bento box was? Thinking it was a dish and not meals to take with you. I was surprise to Google and answered my boring lunch dilemma!!! Now my office staff are always wondering what I'll be bringing for lunch all thanks to this book by Naomi Kijima & Laura Drisussi. I love some of the recipes in this book, of course some foods are not accessible were I live, but who says you can't sub it out for something else. I really like this book, it open your creative cooking skills and taste."
3,CSV vs DSM,"This is a great idea of conceptualizing clients and helping them reach their potential, but it is very esoteric and hard to follow. It is broken down into concepts that are very subjective to rate and seems to be the downfall of this tool. Hopefully the next edition that comes out will have more objective perameters to utilize in providing strengths based care. As the health care industry is heading in the direction of Evidenced Based Practices, the DSM will continue to be the approrpiate tool for measurability and outcomes, unfortunately."
4,"not the best, but a classic none the less","As a fairly big Chow Yun-Fat fan I'd have to say this is my least favorite. I think it's a lack of John Woo. The story never really caught my attention like the first two. Even thought there was more of a love sceen for Chow Yun-Fat, I don't think it showed enough of his passion as did this first one, or even the second one. if you have the first two, or even one you have to buy this movie, just to keep the collection together."
2,Disappointed as well,"I have to agreee with others that say they're disappointed with this napkin holder. The darn sticker does not come off and I would just get another napkin holder if I had a choice to pick again. I received this as a housewarming gift so I'll keep it but as a Oxo fan, this is probably one of their worst products."
1,"Not worth it, and it was free","Got this for free as part of a 4-for-3 promotion, and it wasn't worth it. As others have noted, it came with a large sticker on one side that was difficult to remove and left behind an adhesive residue that cannot be removed. Also, the edges are very sharp and I cut myself while trying to remove the sticker. The spring tensioner is very weak, and doesn't hold up the knapkins properly. Finally, because of the sharp edges, you run the risk of scratching whatever surface upon which it rests."
2,looks good but may scratch your wood table,"The napkin holder looks and functions well, but after a few months of usage it appears the bottom has left some scratches on the wood table."
3,Great Napkin Holder,"Oxo Good Grips Brushed Stainless Steel Napkin PinchI read some reviews where they said the sticker problem was resolved. I received my napkin holder today and the sticker did not come off with ease. After trying several things with no success I got my finger nail polish remover. The sticker glue and what was left of the paper label came off. Depending upon how much of the label is left on the holder, it will require a little rubbing to remove the label and glue. This will not damage the finish either."
2,Beautiful but useless if you can't remove the sticker,"I'm not normally one to write a complaint in public, but I feel that I need to warn prospective buyers of the issue I've been having and apparently others. The napkin holder itself is a beautiful piece and functional, especially for various size napkins. However, it's pointless to own it if I can't remove the sticker that is part of the product packaging. It's bizarre that between soap and water, goo-gone, and the ""hair dryer trick"" that OXO says to do, I can't remove the sticker. For a ~$15 product, it's not worth the time I've put into trying to remove it. It's not normally an issue for most products, but with the stainless steel look, you don't want to damage the outside by scratching the sticker off. Other than the sticker issue, I love this piece, but have thrown it away as ironic as it is."
3,Good Napkin Holder but TERRIBLE Non-removable Label!!!,The napkin holder itself is fine and it matches our kitchen decor... BUT it took two days of soaking in hot soapy water to even get the label to start coming off! There is still a mark on the outside of the napkin holder where you can see where the label was. This was ridiculous and I see from another review that it's been this way since at least 2007! Good Lord OXO... get your act together on this labeling thing. I almost returned the entire thing just because of the label!
2,disappointed in OXO,"I like oxo products but this was just a waste of my time. As other people said, they put a HUGE sticker on one side of the product which is impossible to get off. There is also a barcode type sticker underneath, which leaves residue as well. For being stainless steel, it is going to reflect some kind of mark even after trying to get the stickers off. Plus it reveals fingerprints a lot more than other materials would. I'm returning it, it's not worth $15"
2,Too much of a good thing,"Of course, everybody loves Pachelbel's Canon in D. There is no question about it - it is a great piece of music. But to listen to it eight times in a row is a bit more than one can endure. It probably wouldn't be so bad if the CD didn't contain two versions performed by James Galway. To listen how such a wonderful composition is turn it into commercial trash finished me off. It's a good Pachelbel didn't have to listen to James Galway. The Canon in D deserves better."
5,Great CD for Pachelbel's and other great classical music!,"This CD is great for listening to soothing music while you kick back and relax. I find many of the songs on the CD have a calming affect on me, which is great. The sound quality is not grainy or bad. Some classical music CD have point in the track were it is very hard to hear what is going on. I know that parts of music are supposed to be quite or very quite, but some are to the point where you can't hear anything. This CD doesn't have any of these problems. Overall great buy."
1,ugh!,"this is a good cd, but unfortunately has to have that stupid cannon on so man times. I like the Cannon but did we really need it that many times. Unlike everyone else who reviewed it, I loved the Cleo Laine ""How, Where, When?"". It was the one ray of sunshine throughout the whole dark depression. Don't pay any attention to these reviews, because no one can decide for you. Cleo definately showed off her brilliance of harmony, and is a true gem."
1,Ruins your negatives,"Beware of this product. I used this with their Pec-Pad on my Kodak VC400 120 film. It was just regular film but left a streak when it dried. I try to wipe it off with the cleaner but every time it dries, it leaves a streak so its pretty much on there permanently."
1,No effect on ink,I ordered this in hopes that it would take gel ink off several professional photos that were about three years old. The ink had been on the pictures about four weeks. The cleaner had no effect on the ink.
5,Music that soothes the most savage beasts! (my kids!),"Have you ever had ""one of those days"" where you are so stressed that you feel like you're going to blow up?Put this CD on, and even the kids calm down! I'm serious, it really works! This is a collection of beautiful, calming and timeless music. This is a healthy and intelligent way to relax!"
3,"Great spatulas, splintery handles","I love the crock and the red spatulas--they are very nice and are holding up well, BUT I must say that the handles are really cheap. The wood is splintery and one of the handles was even warped. I was very surprised that they wouldn't use better quality to finish the product. I handwash them, too--they just were like that from day one."
5,The Princess Diaries,"Superb, a wholesome video for all ages. The ""princess"" is an excellent teen model. Make this video a central part of your weekend plans if you'd like a hilariously fun evening with your friends."
4,Cinderella in the Age of Soy Nuts,"What a fun movie! And definitely not just for the pre-teen set. This film is for princesses of all ages. The casting, overall, is top-notch. Anne Hathaway is a fabulous choice for the role of Mia--truly believable as both ugly duckling and swan. And Julie Andrews is great as the royal granny with an agenda. The only disappointment is the usually-fantastic Heather Matarazzo, who seems to be overacting a little bit here. This movie shines when Mia is away from school...some of the acting in the high school scenes is a little wooden. But Sandra Oh is a hoot as Principal Gupta."
3,"Not the best, not the worst","This movie is a time killer. I would never own it. Way too cheesy. I like Anne Hathaway, and have always loved Julie Andrews though."
4,princess diaries,i thought this movie was great and funny a type of movie for the whole family this movie was about a girl named ameilia who is in high school and finds out she is a princess very very very funny movie so if i were you i would get it
2,"Been there, done that","This is a poor version of Pygmalion - so-so script, predictable, but Julie Andrews is classy throughout."
5,Princess Diaries a Royal Find,"This is a modern fairy tale that keeps you entertained and heart-warmed at the same time. My daughter and I have watched this over and over again, and each time, it is just a pleasure to view. The acting, the script, and the directing are all well-done. Above all, this is a clean movie, a refreshing deviation from today's norm. Enjoy!"
4,... I'd buy it,"The movie was predicatable, but most movies these day's are. It's a good, funny movie and people in the family can watch. And even though it gets shallow at some points, isn't that the way some people are in real life, anyway?Most people complain about making over Anne Hathaway and how you should see the inner beauty.... but people in real life do look for looks (not saying I do). And at the end, Michael [Robert Schwartzman, who is an AWESOME actor and singer by the way] ends up 'seeing her when she was invisible'. So it shows the boy who isn't shallow and DOES see her inner beauty does end up getting the girl.The DVD is actually cool because it has commentaries, 'A New Princess' with all the actors and making all of the movie, and 8 deleted scenes.The casting was done pretty well, except - I don't really think Mandy Moore is that great of an actress, she kind of overacts on the screen - it's fake. Other than that... I think everyone that was picked was good..."
5,5 Stars for Julie!,"This litle story about a semi-geeky teenager who discovers she's heir to the throne of a tiny country is worth seeing only because of the presence of the exquisite Julie Andrews, as the girl's grandmother/Queen. Anne Hathaway is cute as the princess, but the scenes involving the kids just point out how utterly common everyone on the screen is except Julie, who glides, instead of walks, speaks instead of talks, and positively glows at all times. She clicks with Hector Elizondo, too. Just give me 90 minutes of Julie Andrews reading the phone book and I'll be happy. It's great to see her on the big screen again."
2,Terrible ick,"Horribly pretentious film. Main character (Hathaway) is supposed to be sympathetic, but at the end of this film she becomes off-putting. Do not see this film unless you like terrible teen junk."
2,Miss information,"I felt that this product was miss represented -- it said it was a 2 disc collectors set. I thought I was getting both of the movies #1 and #2. All I ended up with was the first movie done in wide screen and full screen. I'm sorry I wasted my money.Also it stated that it was a ""NEW"" copy - but it had already been opened - how do I know if it hadn't already been used or played before it come to me."
4,funny,This movie was so funny. If you get a chance to buy it go do it. I was rollin around on the ground when I saw it. That girl does some of the stupidest things I have ever seen. And if you have young kids its good for them too.
5,Perfect Pick-Me-Up,"I felt really down, but after watching The Princess Diaries I felt better. Anyone can enjoy this! Disney has done another great movie. Anne Hathaway plays as Mia Thermopolis, the dorky teenage sophomore in high school. She ""learns"" to become a princess and she ends up loving it. This is a perfect for anyone who believes that miracles happen."
3,The Author Did It!,"In this absurdist play, the author is a character, telling us that he did not know how to write the play. During it, he chastises his characters and the actors and provides comic relief to an otherwise serious subjects such as class warfare,rape, abortion, and murder. However, a somewhat unsatisfying ending spoiled it alittle. I think the author did it!"
4,The Cavern,"The script arrived in exactly the condition at which it was advertised. There was some delay in the delivery, but due, it turned out, to some serious health problems at the vendor's end -- problems which certainly took precedence over the question of delivery date. All in all, I am extremely satisfied."
1,A second-rate product,"Like the other review, this thing takes so long to charge batteries. I'm done with rayovac after buying this."
1,What A Bad Film!,"I skipped this one in the theaters, not on purpose, but because of Bruce Willis. I have never liked any of his movies.So, in one night, I watched this one and Deep Impact. I enjoyed Deep Impact because it was more about how we as humans, prepare for the ""end.""Armageddon on a whole is simply terrible. Everything feels artificial and forced. Let's build sympathy for Bruce. Let's feel sorry for two young people in love ... . Let's believe that NASA will send idiots into space to save the earth. All of the emotion in this film was so staged and fake, that it was hard to feel for these characters. I have to wonder about people who said they cried when watching this film. I also never felt a sense of doom like I did when watching movies like Independence Day or Deep Impact.Maybe I was in a bad mood when I watched this. Maybe this was simply a bad movie. One thing for sure, I wont watch it again."
2,Barrel of laughs,"This movie was totally ridiculous. The only reason to watch it is the first five minutes, wherein you see several small pieces of the meteor hitting the USA. The story doesn't make any sense, the action is just-above-average. The story is so impropable and predictable, it is actually hilarious. Every 5 minutes in the movie something goes wrong, but guess what ... in the end the hero wins. This is a typical example of an American big budget piece of crap. The special effects aren't that good either. I wonder why such great actors as Steve Buscemi, Liv Tyler, Billy Bob Thornton and Bruce Willis participated in creating this piece of fluf. The pay was probably exceptionally good."
3,"2 and a half stars, way over rated","The plot was unrealistic and not well thought up. The plot was not really even there, the acting was terrible ( especially tylers daughter, join a band) it was funny and average at best. if you have a free year spend 2 and a half hours on this."
1,Armageddon outa here!,"Yes, ""Armageddon"" does have wall to wall action. And yet it still manages to be insufferably dull. Loud! Obnoxious! And would somebody please HOLD THAT CAMERA STILL!!!Who's in which shuttle? Who's dead? Who's alive? Who cares? If this is the 90s answer to ""Star Wars,"" someone please take me back to the 70s."
1,Idiotic plot and story; some good character acting,"This is one of the most annoying action movies I have ever watched. The last 30 minutes were so full of rapid-fire scene cuts and the over-used get-out-of-the-building-with-1 second-left-on-the-time-bomb type scenarios that I had to turn the DVD player off. I knew that somehow the team would pull it off, but my sensibilities were so insulted that I had to end the onslaught. It's too bad, because I like Bruce Willis and I thought the Russian cosmonaut was great."
1,Major waste of time & money,"The movie had a pretty good plotline. Astroid about to blow up earth, government blows up astroid at last minute. Sounds good. It would have been good if this plot had been complemented by special effects. Instead, it was more like the special effects were complemented by the plotline! They just about made up the entire movie. There was probably about 45 minutes of movie there, but a ton of junk was added. You spent the first half of the movie wishing the drillers would get off the ground, and the second half wishing they'd get back on it!"
2,Criterion Collection?,"And I quote ""...the Criterion Collection is a large and growing selection of classic and contemporary films that have been singled out for the red carpet treatment...""Ugh!Just when I thought ""Criterion Collection"" meant they chose nothing but the best movies.The movie had much to be desired - though I must admit I'm a Bruce Willis fan, and Liv Tyler is quite a peice of, era, ehem.... Anyhow, it was still a disappointment."
2,I just cannot suspend my disbelief that much.,"The movie wasn't that bad, but the errors are just too much to overcome:I mean, an asteroid the Size of Texas and you don't see it until it is two weeks away?We can train oil drillers how to do Zero-G work in less than two weeks?Those are the biggest non-spoiler issues I have with the movie.The DVD makes it all worthwhile thanks to an absolutely cool version of Aerosmith's video ""Don't wanna mis a thing""."
1,The Worst Movie I have ever seen.,My brain hurt so much after seeing this movie and you want to know why? I could not for the life of me recall a worst movie. My God what have they done!
1,Shallow Impact.,One will enjoy this movie to a level of inverse proportion to one's intelligence quotient.
2,Movie Excellent - Criterion Version Worthless,"If you want to see a great action movie with some romantic overtones and some honest friendships between very different men then this is a great movie but take my advice and only buy the movie and not the criterion version. It advertises a humorous outtakes video and if you think cursing is funny then you will like it but that is all it has to offer. The commentaries do a lot of talking but don't really offer much detail in the way the movie was made. Ben Affleck comes off as a young smart aleck and you are better off buying just the movie, saving some money and enjoying some really great acting."
1,"Bad Actors, Bad Effects, Bad Story= WORSE MOVIE IN THE WORLD",Simply the worst film I have ever set eyes on. The only good part was the New York part. The Gayest Movie I have ever seen. The stupidest part was THE WHOLE MOVIE!!!! Save Your Money And Get GODZILLA! WARNING STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!!!
5,This movie was very well put together and I loved it.,"Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, and Liv Tyler delivered an incredible performance with this movie. I love that Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler is Liv's father. It just makes the whole thing click. Ben & Liv look fantastic together and I wish that they would get together for real. Thank you all for making this movie"
4,Visually stunning,Micheal Bay's style combined with Willis's performance make Armageddon look like The Rock on steroids. Definitely worth the $7 at the theaters and MUCH more at $15 to own at home with surround sound. Could have been better if not for some redundant scenes and mediocre dialouge. If you are a Bruckheimer fan definetly a not-miss.
5,Very Good! =D,"I must say that this is one of my top 5 favorite movies. Sure there are a lot of haters and bashers of the film but like what other's have said, you should take it for what it is, an action film with special effects. Although everything is not 100% accurate in terms of reality, however the point is appreciating the visuals, the audio, and the overall roller coaster ride of a storyline. This movie has other deeper themes such as honor, sacrafice,love, and reconciliation and redemtion. For what it's worth I belive the deeper themes to the movie make it more of appreciated and show the better side of humanity. Our heros in this film have their own personal hangups, baggage, and flaws but make a difference in what they do. Personally, I'd recommend this film for these reasons more if anything. And the original music score was beautiful! Very dramatic and memorable. (Got the CD). Just see it for yourself. Enjoy!"
3,"A ""Rock"" of a good time!","With a sudden bame, blast and boom! The load sound efx burst into your ears to the impact of where you can't take it. One of the most commercial Jerry Bruckheimer films ever and opened doors for Michael Bay for future jobs. Bay,Known for better movies like ""the Rock"" or not so great movies as ""Pearl Harbor"" this movie is a whorle of his great mixture in lots of action. In previous films Michael Bay has proven he can make an excellent action movie ,but when the script fails to depict charactorization and plot the film has only one thing to holds its weight on... Its humor and its action. Bruce Wills is fun to see him agian in the genre that made him a Hollywood superstar. Ben Affleck has his moments as well This movie is worth watching for a good time just if you don't ask for too much of it."
1,The one star is for Billy Bob's performance...,"I hated this movie. The acting was terrible, ESPECIALLY Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck. They had no chemistry! The dialogue was not funny, those oil rigger clods they left it up to to save the world.....if that ever becomes the case, God help us all. The story was uninspiring and all the action that was meant to be suspenseful left me feeling like a wrung out dishcloth. This movie was too long, and damn loud. A disgrace. Definitely one of the worst I've seen. See Deep Impact instead."
4,dvd review,"The Criterion DVD was awesome. Great picture, superb sound, and the extras were incredible. Particularly enjoyed the audio commentary tracks and the gag reel. Would recommend."
1,The Suckiest Thing You'll Ever SEEEE!,"Armageddon stunck my place up. I had to fast foward half the movie to get to the coolest New York part. This movie was gay in many ways, First, I thought it was stupid how the dog was drulling on the Godzilla toys because all in all the critics said Godzilla was BETTER than Armageddon. Second, they had too many parties on the asteroid which made this the GAYEST movie I have ever seen!"
3,Disaster MissFired,"This is one of those movies that works much better on the small screen.It has a great cast, some memorable performances and some state-of-the-art Special Effects, however, the story is a little week and even sappy in some points.In the theatre it kind of bored me, but the DVD is much better. Not many extras but it does have the Aerosmith music video for the film on it.This is a better film to watch in the living room with your family and should have passed the big screen. Disaster missed this mark!"
1,PUH-LEEZE,This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen!!! Don't spend your money on this! The only good thing that came from this movie is the song 'I don't wanna miss a thing'.
1,"When the end of the world comes,I hope it's betterthan this!","Yuck! Steve Buscemi and a few of the drillers are the only reason to watch this movie that, like Titanic, had such a big budget that it couldn't afford a script, just a bunch of poorly acted, embarrising cliches. Ben Affleck looks great, but he is almost one dimensional, as is Bruce Willis, and Liv Tyler. Tearjerker ending better than anything else in the movie, but so contrived, I felt stupid for crying. I knew I was supposed to be sobbing, so I wasn't really moved. Save this movie for nights when you need a damn good laugh, or when you're teaching a screenwriting class, and need to show what an awful, wretched, cheap, terrible, cliched script looks like. Titanic would be another example for this excercise. This movie had me PRAYING for the end of the world."
4,one of the most powerful and epic films ever,"armageddon is a powerful and touching story filled with endless suspense and adventure. the actors are excellent and give a memorable performance as we cry areselves to tears. it is one of the greatest films ever made, and will forever be a classic."
1,"A not so fun movie, that the whole family can hate together!","This movie was sooo bad. It made Godzilla look like Schindler's List. If your looking for a good disaster flick see Deep Impact, but if your looking for the worst movie of 1998 go ahead and see this $hitfest."
1,"terrible, so unrealistic!","It's the most unrealistic movie I have seen in a long time. Besides, it's the same thing as Deep Impact!"
1,Garbage!,"I've seen this movie,and.....I've never jawned so much in my entire life as I did seeing thisone. Rubbish from beginning to end."
1,COMDEMNATION NOTIFICATION,"By the power of the asteroids, I condemn this movie for being brainless, heartless, a total waste of money. Avoid at any cost."
1,Shoot me!,"I thought TWISTER was the worst movie that was also a huge hit I'd ever seen. But, unbelievably, I found a hit movie that was even worse: ARMAGEDDON. Literally, I think it would be hard to make a worse movie even if you TRIED. And I mean that!!"
4,Lots of fun!!! Ten times better than Deep Impact!!!,"This disaster flick is as good as those of the seventies (Poseidon Adventure, etc.) but filled with special effects reminding you its the 90s. I saw it in the theater, but I would imagine that it would be GREAT on DVD!"
1,The death of american good taste,"This movie is the perfect example of how profit driven studios occasionally forget that soulless, poorly executed, infantile, two and a half hour trailers can be hugely commercially successful if marketed correctly. Many people refute my condemnation of this movie by saying that they go to the movies to enjoy themselves not to see important or artistic works. First of all, seeing intellegent, inspired and creative works pleases me more than anything else, the feeling I get when I leave the theatre is like nothing else. I didn't enjoy this movie for a second. It sickened me. If people truly enjoy movies like this (it made $200 mil domestically) I don't understand how this does so well, when intellegent, well-crafted and yes, highly entertaining movies like the insider make $30 mil. Nixon barely registered at the box office. If this is the choice of the American people, the future of art is bleak."
1,Time to invent the NO STARS symbol just for this film!,"Ok... Where can I start?..... How about WHY? Why is there a critereon edition of this film? Did Michael Bay pay somebody to give it the criterion edition? I thought that was for special films... Ones that we may remember ten minutes after we have seen it! The film itself is full of (no offense) all American smultz, I can stomache the first half of the film.. then I have to go and watch Appolo13 to remind myself that good space films are still made. Quality of the DVD is good, but then I've seen DVDs with ten times worse quality, and enjoyed them more. I think Aerosmith should write a new song, titled..'' You're not going to miss a thing'' and play it to people who have decided not to buy this DVD! Saying that, the DVD makes a good drinks coaster in my lounge, and a great frisby for the kids in the park."
1,"Less people, more Armageddons",Reading these reviews leaves me feeling disturbed. 'Greatest movie of all time?' If only Armageddon was indeed near...there would be fewer of these no-taste-havin' crumbsnatchas online to post good reviews of bad flicks.
1,You've got to be kidding me..,My Goodfellas dvd has to be flipped over after an hour. The Virgin Spring is still only available on vhs. Armageddon gets a Criterion release. Makes sense.
1,Dumb,"I don't know why I'm even writing a review on this movie right now, but this is one of the dumbest movies ever made.Once a guy tried to tell me how realistic it was. I couldn't stop laughing."
1,Made me want to bludgeon myself unconscious!!,"It stank... I thought the theater smelt bad, but it turned out to be the movie!!"
2,Please--I wish garbage like this wouldn't be shown any more-,Terrible the only reason this movie didn't totally blow was because of the amazing speciall effects. other than that the movie wasn't good enough for the movie theatres
1,This movie was a waste of money,Ugh is all I have to say about this excuse for a movie. What were they thinking? I rented it and felt a sense of deja vu...then I remembered I had just rented Deep Impact...What the heck was I thinking?
3,"Cool movie, slightly flawed","This was an absolutely great special effects masterpiece. Check out the scene where the train station gets blown to bits, the demise of the empire state building etc. The sound is brilliant and the images are crisp and clear. The only problem that I had was that so many things went wrong. Shucks, I mean at the end of the movie so many things had gone wrong on the astroid that it was a pure miracle any of the crew survived. What I also liked was that it kept me emotionally hooked in through most af the show. If you like scf-fi, Bruce Willis and the lot, it's a must have."
1,Why...Michael Bay...Why?,"It was everything that I would expect from director Michael Bay - a summer blockbuster filled with every action/thiller/sci-fi clich√© known to man that completely undermines science, logic and reason. Obviously, these kinds of movies are not made for cognitive minds. They are made for people who like watching American Idol and Dancing with the Stars."
1,A PITIFUL ATTEMPT FOR A GOOD ACTION/CHIC FLICK,"I am tired of all the crap that has riddled this movie industry. This movie was sooo pathatic. I hated it. OOOH, animal crakers, how romantic. I could have puked. I about threw my T.V. on to the streets below my Jackson Hole cabin."
1,The movie itself 5 stars. Non anamorphic DVD 0 stars.,"Sure wish the studio would make an anamorphic version so that people like me with a widescreen TV wouldn't have to zoom the picture to fill the screen and lose the clarity of the movie. All those people giving this product a great review must be watching on an antique square screen TV. Come on studio anamorphic, anamorphic, anamorphic!!!"
3,THE MOVIE GETS 5 STARS,"The movie is nicely paced with great action, jaw-dropping special effects, romance, humor, amusing characters and an interesting plot. I enjoyed the interaction of Bruce and Ben's characters the most.I am here to warn you about the special features. I give it two stars; I was completely disappointed. It was just plain boring--too many people talking too much. I wanted to see how the special effects were made, not clips of the movie with commentaries! I did enjoy a few parts--particularly how they set up the meteor hitting Paris, now that was interesting! The special features weren't all bad, but to me, not worth the money I spent because I only liked a very small percentage of them.I wouldn't recommend the CRITERION DVD unless it is one of your top favorite movies. If I had it to do over I would have purchased just the ARMAGEDDON DVD. In any case, this is a fantastic DVD movie and the sound and picture quality are TOP KNOTCH. I hope this helps you."
1,The space operette,"Another stupid movie like Independance Day where the gratuitous action seems to attract a lot of people. What can be said about this Hollywood product ? First, you see that movie like you eat a hamburger at Mac-Donald : another Bruce Willis movie, oh excuse-me i mean Big mac. Seriously, the movie is very weak, when i see it i didn't understand anything. Bruce Willis acts like he does in a lot of movie, that is to say like a true American hero who wants to save the world. The ""plot"" itself is a nonsense : a group of true stupid heroes want to save the world and destroy a big rock coming to earth. Don't expect to see any scientific data in the movie, there is only horrible acting, story, bad special effects."
1,Literally painfully stupid.,"I used to not have a movie I considered the worst of all time. I've watched some pretty bad ones, but it's hard to distinguish one movie with a ludicrous plot, bad acting, bad editing, etc., from another. But all those bad films had two things in common: they had no talent and no budget. There is no excuse for garbage like Armageddon to ever exist. But it does, and the magnitude of it qualifies it as the worst movie ever made.Shallow, idiotically patriotic, insulting, and irritating are a few of its characterizations. That so many people like this movie frightens me.Watch ""Deep Impact"". It's a little sappy at times, but it's a far superior movie."
1,"An absolutely ""Brainless"" experience.","An example of total producer and directorial incompetance which may appeal to teenagers of below average intelligence. To a normal adult: the science in this movie is so bad as to be beyond even enjoyment as a ""class B BOMB"""
1,Plain waste of time,"Armageddon is just about the worst movie since Independence Day. Great effects and sound, but really no contents at all, playing on the cheapest elements in movies. Really poor!Only bright side, Bruce Willis was in it!"
2,Buschemi's worst,"Forget that this movie had a plot a simpleton could write on the back of a matchbook, what it's real claim to fame should be is making Steve Buschemi a cliche. It will be quite a long time for me to once again think him funny after his pathtically over the top performance in which every line he uttered appeared to be with a wink. Like he was saying ""Here you go idiots, here's another ""Funny"" one liner."" It got to the point where I was literally embarrased for him. I will have to watch Fargo 10 times to cleanse the bad taste from the left side of my brain."
5,"Great plot, acting, topic, and ending. Best movie ever made.","This is my favorite movie of all time. I think that with a combination af Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Bruce Willis and other wonderful actors that it couldn't have gotten any better. I am also a sucker for happy endings. Things like the end of the world bewilder and amaze me. So all in all- a great movie."
4,Can't you people see it's just fun,"What is all these peoples problem with this movie. OK, it's not a great piece of cinema. It's daft, unbelievable, completely over the top, and far too ridiculously ""Yeah! Go America!"" that you cannot take this film seriously. But all these people reviewing seem to. Why? It's just brain dead fun.The idea is, watch it, don't think and just go ""cool special effects"". I mean, how can you take a film seriously which has the line ""He's got space dementia"". Sort it out and see the funny side of movies like this. Al pizzazz, no brain, but fun!Oh, and why has no-one else mentioned the brilliance of Steve Buscemi in this."
1,It doesn't get much worse than this.,"I can't remember a movie that I have disliked more than this. I know it's Science Fiction, but come on. You don't have to abandon all logic when making a film from this genre. Anything in this movie resembling reality is purely coincidental. It's predictable, corny, boring, stupid and just plain silly. This movie would have you believe that oil workers can become astronauts in two weeks, NASA builds space drilling vehicles with machine guns on them, and Ben Affleck can pass as an oil worker. Need I say more? The only highlight of the film, for me, was when Bruce Willis blew himself up. If only it had been Michael Bay(director). Then I would have given it another star."
3,Good Comedy and Lead Men,I thoroughly enjoyed watching the characters in this movie interact with one another. The one liners were dead on and the comedy lasted throughout the film. I'm excited that Billy Bob and Bruce Willis want to continue working together with upcoming films like the Astronaut Farmer because they showed in this film that they could make us smile.
1,Huge waste of time,"Stupid, stupid, stupid! The premise is totally unoriginal, and it goes downhill from there. There were so many explosions and special effects, no one could tell what was going on. Of course, that's probaly good, considering how bad the acting was. I expect Bruce Willis and Liv Tyler to make movies like this, but I'm dissapointed that fine actors like Ben Affleck, Steve Buschemi, and Billy Bob Thornton appeared in this."
2,Uninspired,"The Sticky actually liked the premise of this story. A huge ball of Sticky Rice is hurling towards the earth and a bunch of misfit hawker food operators are forced in the task of saving earth from this impending disaster. But unfortunately it kind of goes downhill from there. As everyone knows, the way to stop a ball of Sticky Rice from smashing earth to bits is to actually dress up the earth as a big trolley tray fill with all sorts of yum cha snacks. Then the ball will just scurry away in fright. But the americans do it in their typical way, blow the thing up and ask questions later. Ho hum.The most devilish thing about this movie though is Ben Affleck's sick laugh - the showing of the gums and teeth - truly frightening. It's right up there with Arnold Schwarzenegger's sick laugh."
2,"Derivative, offensive...","Derivative, offensive, and shoddily put together, ""ARMAGEDDON"" is a testimony to what a...director can do when given enough money. Only saving grace is an occasional good moment of acting from some of the supporting cast."
1,"A Mess of stupid characters, one-liners, and special FX","I seldom walk out of movies but the first 50 minutes of Armageddon was SO incredibly stupid, that I wanted the world to be destroyed. I had no curiosity to see how this movie ended and I walked out, although I wasn't alone. This is mindless bravura at its worst. If you can buy the most ridiculous plot since Waterworld, tolerate a one-liner every 5 minutes, and put up with the childish acting and over-acting, then give this movie a try. If not, by all means, skip it. Its disappointing to see that Criterion has wasted money on this garbage. However, I'm sure there are enough mindless movie fans to justify their decision."
4,"Exciting, Powerful, High Exposive, Flag Waving good movie","I feel that this movie is extremely exciting due to all the special effects. The characters are funny and likeable. Bruce Willis did a great job playing his character. One of his best performances yet.The directors did a great job of playing with your emotions. You were consantly on the edge of your seat. It made you feel proud to be an American. Yes, this movie is unbelievable...that's what this type of movie is-fiction.I don't recommend you like your small children watch this movie due to the content.I highly recommend this movie for your home theater system."
4,Relax & Enjoy! It's Science ***FICTION*** people!!,"You know, after reading some of the negative reviews of this EXCELLENT ACTION/ADVENTURE Sci-Fi movie, I can't help being curious about what the snob-rules club finds interesting. My guess would be stuffy, boring, endlessly wordy ""art"" flicks.This picture has plenty to offer - action, humor, suspense, loveable and quirky characters, patriotism, phenomenal special effects & a killer soundtrack ... what's not to love?It's two and one half hours of FUN entertainment with just enough plot to hold it all together.It's science fiction - it's not meant to change the world, challenge your intellect or interject a new world philosophy. I feel sorry for those folks who can't relax enough to watch a well acted, well directed and well presented movie without over-analyzing every aspect of it.Sometimes you need a movie with deep meaning. Other times you just need a little Armageddon..."
1,Ugh!,The only possible disaster worse than this movie is the one it depicts. Glittery big-budget nonsense with just enough character development to fill a thimble. Do yourself a favor. Watch Nova instead.
1,Plainly a disaster . . .,"All that hype, and for what. The acting stunk, the special effects not so special (okay 1 star just for that, and only that). Sorry, no recommendations here."
5,This Movie Is The Best!!!!!!!!,This movie was the best!!!!! Aerosmith rocks in this movie!!! It's about an comet the size of Texas hurtling torwards Earth. So NASA sends a bunch of roughneck oil drillers to stop it from hitting Earth. The actors are amazing in this movie. I would reccomend this movie to anybody who likes action.
5,Historically Great!,"Ok, so it's your typical Bruce Willis saves the planet once again movie... The storyline is a bit cheesey, the soundtrack is annoying... but it's one incredible rush of a ride! The charactors are funny, the action is Top Rate! Who cares what anyone says... Armageddon is one Hip Movie! Let's just settle down on the ""I don't want to miss a thing"" crave!!! The song stinks! It was best left for Barbara Striesand to destroy in the first place! *****"
2,Give me a break,"They MUST be kidding. Stupid as hell. ""Duuuhhh, we didn't see it until now. If we're going to drilll into it, we should send a whole TEAM of untrained ""astronauts"", who are drilling people. One of them is a world-respected bad ass, but he gets to take his whole team of flunkies. Yeah, the world is safe now....""Liv looked really good, though...."
3,"Bruce Willis is a good actor, but I've seen better","Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer make a good team, but I thought The Rock was better. Had some good acting from Billy Bob Thornton and Ben Afflack, and even Steve Buscemi. I'm also a big Bruce Willis fan, but like I said earlier I've seen him do better than this. Now I'm not saying that it's a bad movie, but I'm also not saying it's a great movie."
4,Michael Bay Conspiracy,"I'm beginning to think there is a internet conspiracy to smear Michael Bay movies. The same hateful and mindless attacks appear on many of Bay's movies, especially if Ben Affleck apears in them. Well, I think Armageddon is wonderful entertainment, and I've never come across anyone in person who hasn't been enthusiastic about the film."
3,Disappointing Format,"Although this movie would never qualify for an Oscar, I still love it. I love the interplay between the characters and its when I first fell in love with Liv Tyler. But, although its labeled ""wide screen"", its only letterbox with black bars on all four sides. I have a 51 inch wide screen tv and this film would be so much better if I could see it the way I saw it in the theater! My advise to anyone thinking of buying this DVD should wait until they upgrade the format to true wide screen."
1,The worst film I've seen on DVD,"Was this movie made just to display what they are capable of doing with modern special effects? It was just a predictable, macho, brainless, overly patriotic waste of film."
1,TAKE YOUR MONEY AND RUN!,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Crass, boring, stupidly acted, sitting through it was not unlike having a metal bucket put over your head and having someone beat on it with a wooden spoon for two hours. Bruce Willis' performance was embarrassing. Deep Impact was a WAY better picture!"
3,"Gr8 Actors, Poor Directing","Directed in the dard style used in Canada and Europe. Dark rooms, dark outside, dark everything. Too bad a great story and great acting talent was wasted on this director."
3,This movie is okay.,I saw this in theaters like 2 years ago and it was okay for an action movie. The special effects were great but I really didn't like the acting and the whole concept of the story. I just didn't like the movie at all. I did like the ending though.
3,Cute but messy,My kids had a lot of fun digging out the Dino bones but definitely do this outside. Very messy!!! Would buy it again though.
4,gifts,"looked likes lots of fun, gave them to my 4 yr old nephews and they were excited. didnt get to hear yet if they had fun with them."
5,The perfect Mozart performer,"Shear delight. De Larrocha is utterly amazing, her technique is flawless, and plays mozart in a unique, desireable, and familiar way; a way not pianists can do.Superbly clean.The sonata in D gives me chills. Her playing is lovely."
5,An outstanding review of Hodgkin's work,"This book is different from most catalogues raisonnees that I've seen, which often provide small, black and white reproductions. In this one, the reproductions are generally quite large, and almost all in color. It's a beautiful book, well worth the cost for anyone interested in Hodgkin."
2,"Dull. Very, very dull.","When I first heard the song ""Professional Widow"", I was blown away. Yes, it was great. But then I decided, hey, what can a few remixes do to such a great song?A lot. And none of it good.The dance mixes do nothing but repeat. if you like unbelieveably tacky dance beats banging from all sides as you just barely make out Tori's occasional voice, be my guest. The album version is the only good song on the album, and I really did TRY to like these remixes.Great CD cover, though. A pity about the remixes. Try ""In the springtime of his voodoo"" instead. You'll find little substance in the ""Jackie's strength"" remixes, but they're also better then these."
1,Poor quality and support from MFG.,"For starters, the 1046 is like 75gph and for most applications it is far too weak to push water through a UV Sterilizer. I bought this to power my Coralife 18W UV Sterilizer and there was a constant air pocket in the intake tube. Tried burping the unit by powering off, still lots of airpocket was unable to be eliminated. Also, the unit was prone to leaking. It didn't leak a lot but the bottom of the unit was always wet. Any movement would cause it to leak more. Some of it was coming from the intake barb and a tiny drip bubble formed around the rubber impeller drip O-ring seal. I tried calling Eheim but no support numbers on user manual. Googled Eheim but only found it when I browsed forum. I then called number and was told they would have to call me back but never did. I would not recomend this product to anybody using a tank bigger than 10 gallons. I bought the Mahineland 900 and that works awesome!! Was able to power up my UV sterilizer just find."
3,Informative but with an old-fashioned layout,"I read this book aloud to my tween boys, but in the Norwegian version. Each two-page spread covers one topic. Some focus on the homes of a particularly interesting creature, for example beavers, ants/termites and bees. Others focus on a particular habitat, for example the backyard, the coast, and the lake. Other themes are stolen homes, underground homes and nests.The artwork, text and content are fine, but what I didn't like was the layout. We've gotten used to more modern layouts, with lots of photos/illustrations, each with its own caption or fact-box. In contrast, this layout contains one large scene and one long text. You have to search for the animals/homes referred to in the text. This kind of hide-and-seek might be fun for some, but for us it was mostly a nuisance."
4,This book is an excellent easy read!,"I have got to say that I really enjoyed reading this book. The content was very informative and it didn't put me to sleep. If you're like me and hate to read, then this is the perfect book for you. It addressed everything from getting over your doubt to finally getting the courage and how to get started. The more I read this book, the more excited I became about starting my own business. It was like she was there guiding me. I think if someone is comtemplating about starting their own business, they should read this book first. Other books might scare/bore them off. One more thing, if you don't know exactly what business you want to get into, this book gives great ideas on making that decision and making sure it's the right decision."
1,Very poor choice. Look elsewhere,"I'm very disappointed with this book. Very vague and broad examples and not a lot of the nuts and bolts of success. Jennifer Kushell is the self crowned princess of the young entrepreneurial spirit. She claims to have launched successfull business ventures but never elaborates anywhere in her books or websites and instead offers page after page of fluff and filler on how to get ahead. After wasting my time with this book and two of her other books, I'd be skeptical of allowing her to run a lemonade stand. Please save your time and money. There are many better choices by PROVEN success stories. Multiple streams of Income by Robert Allen and How to Buy a Business: Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition by Richard A. Joseph are two of many that are a much better read for your time and money"
5,Sturdy,"Nice, sturdy unit, does not wobble or bend when full. Very handy. I like it so much I'll likely buy another."
4,Built sturdy with plenty of file space. Need better/large foam protection for the bottom corners.,"I had some concerns after reading some of the previous reviews regarding receiving a damage product. My shipment came packaged in a fitted heavy-duty cardboard box and that protected the organizer very well.Its built very sturdy and is heavy enough that it won't slide around or tipped over like some other file organizer I previous bought. The exterior mesh wall isn't flat like the interior mesh.The measurements of the organizer is close to as described mine is (13-1/4"" wide x 11-1/4"" deep x 13"" highest point). It came with 4 tiny flimsy, square foam to stick to the bottom corner to protect your surface. There is plenty of space for a load of files. My standard files for letter-size documents sticks out a little width-wise and 1-1/2"" height-wise when fully loaded.I would rate it as 4.5 stars but there's no option for that."
5,Getting Organized...Great help,Just received this product and it is great! I was a bit worried that it would be too tall once the file folders were placed in the vertical slat areas. It is not too tall. It has helped me clean up my desk and organize the most often used folders. It may over time begin to sag or become crooked from the weight of the folders but it will have served it's purpose at that point I'm sure. The price was reasonable and I would recommend this for helping to get organized!
2,a little of everything and not MUCH of anything,"At least the title is really not decieving. ""Thoughts"" is pretty accurate. Not much in the way of info, except maybe some mic techniques.It just seemed more like a bragging rights book - throwing 'insider' words at you while explaining what you would already know if you knew those words. Well actually, not much was explained, just hinted at.Pretend you're a well respected producer who's 'in the know' with all the shortcut terminology, and you get together with another of the same background and chew the fat, tossing the latest hip vernacular back and forth over a few drinks. Man oh man do you feel cool."
4,series finale,The series finale is solid if a little abrupt. Fallon left few if any unanswered questions. The series was not as complex as terry goodkind or robert jordan--but all in all a good read with enough twists and turns to keep it interesting.
4,my favorite Lester Young !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This CD - recorded, surprizingly, AFTER World War II and Lester's well-documented Army problems, is my favorite Lester Young. His tone is cool, sweet and breathy. The inspiration to Stan Getz and a decade of Cool sax players. He is happy and cheerful in the swing songs and does a great job on the ballads without rushing them.Particularly effective is ""Body and Soul"" and ""Indiana"".Some of these tracks overlap the ""Alladin"" Sessions and a Verve recording. This one has the best sound.Nat ""King"" Cole plays great accompanying piano. ""Hyperactive"" piano. Lester and Nat's lines flow and dance around each other.Yeah it's scratchy, tubey, from 78 shellac masters and vacuum tube amps, but this is Lester at his best!Five stars for performance, losing a half star for recording quality, which is about as good as can be expected with the originals."
1,lots of frustration,"Whenever you put this battery on, the phone says ""please use genuine battery. Automatic Shutdown. 10.9.8.etc..,"" and it turns off automatically. When you fly, you must turn off the phone, and you arrive at the destination to arrange the pick-up; BUT you are out of luck with this battery because you cannot turn the phone on. Don't buy it. Save yourself a trouble. To make is work, you must play with the battery and phone countless hours while attached to the charge adapter which means you need an outlet also.One more thing is that someone mentioned that actual mAh is smaller than the orginal battery that came with the phone. Well, it is true. For the price, that's what you get, I guess. In general, LG Phone sucks and this battery adds more aggrevation to your life that you don't need. I'm just waiting for my cell phone contract to run out so that I can ditch this phone and get new Samsung or something that is not LG."
1,The tape was absolutely disappointing!,"Ok...""The Intervention"", to me, is the BEST episode! I am it's biggest fan! But listen...the tape was recorded in extensive play, I could have done better with my VCR. The words weren't with their mouths on some parts, if you want it, don't pay attention to their lips to avoid getting confused. AND, ok, I understand that they have little slots for the commercial when it airs, BUT on the tape they could have at least edited them out! The little commercials slots were right there, like 3 1/2 seconds it would fade out, and not at the most impressive times either. That's it. I should have bought the DVD as I planned, anything would have been better than that!"
1,Light on contraptions,"Made the mistake of watching this with our toddler. It has a few nods to the good days of the duo, but I don't think I'd enjoy rewatching it even without kids around.It's not as if Wallace and Gromit is renowned for brilliant plots, but it felt like this one went back to barely trying. Imagine a modern ""action"" movie with all the usual family-unfriendly elements, crammed into a fifteen minute cartoon parody (but without much lightheartedness to make up for it) -- that's about how this felt. There's little suspense, so the story moves pretty quick to threats and abuse until time is finally up and the uninspired ending lands.There were a few fun gags and a couple touching moments but this short film is absolutely NOT charming or even clever on the whole. Even the contraptions just seemed uninspired and obligatory, mostly just filler. Give ""A Grand Day Out"" another watch before you bother with ""The Loaf of Death (SUBTITLE: THE LADY IS A SERIAL KILLER)""."
4,New to Marilyn,I rented this documentary because I didn't live in the Marilyn Monroe era and therefore I had no knowledge of her story. This documentary really helped me understand her story more. I only wished the documentary was longer so it could have had more depth.
2,Not satisfied,The cd looks newbutthe box is olddid not come with plastic like all new cdcame in a disposable bag.This does not seem right as the seller offers the product as new
2,Pales in comparison to Broadway cast cd,The voices are so much better on the OBC. The orchestrations sound better too. This cd is not worth buying...
1,um...no,"Please! This is one of the worst theatrical investments of my life. I absolutely love this show (Bernadette style), and so the revulsive sounds emminating from my cd player with this version are quite an offense. Do yourself a favor and buy the New York cast recording...you'll only be hurting yourself with this sketchy likeness of Into the Woods."
4,Worth it,"After hearing the other reveiws and listening to peices of the Broadway version, I decided to get the London one because it had an extra song and was darker. I'm really glad I did... although some of the vocal performances pale slightly in comparison to the Broadway cd, this is a lovely cd once you get used to the accents. And I personally cannot chose which Witch was better... they were simply different styles, although Bernadette Peters has a better singing voice. I like the narrator more on this recording for the speaking parts, but on Ever After, the broadway narrator is much better, Jack, Cinderella, the baker, the princes and the baker's wife were about the same on both. I also really enjoyed Little red riding hood and the wolf. The songs focus more on acting and putting emotions into the voice, making it more realistic than outstanding vocal performances as on the broadway cd. For anyone who enjoys faerie tales or who's interested in this play, I suggest getting this."
3,"BORING, but it has its moments!","Yes, it has its moments...but all in all this is pretty boring! I think I have only listened to it once. I don't know how to explain it, but after seeing the Broadway company and listening to the CD...it's too hard to switch opinions. I will have to say that Julia McKenzie gives Bernadette a run for her money! She is a great stage presence and brings a lot to the role of the witch!"
5,THE BEST,This is my favorite Christmas movie. I watch it at least 3 times during the holiday season. Love the story and love the happy ending.
1,Overpriced and lacks quality,"I'd give it 0 stars if I could, but that wasn't an option! You figure you would get your money's worth, right? Wrong! Mine is also stuck at the F2 error code and despite the fact that I have attempted to disconnect/reconnect the plug, and tried several different outlets, no luck. I have chronic back pain and rely on this pad to function without pain. This is just unacceptable and should be recalled with all of these complaints. Problem now is I threw away the box and receipt, so can't take it back and not sure Sunbeam would honor a warranty without proof of purchase. Sunbeam, you suck!"
1,Works great! For less than a month.,"Now, it's stuck on F2. I tried everything. Nothing! I tried pushing the plug (heating pad) and the cord tightly together. One of the gray prongs broke! I have had this less than a month and now it's in my closet. I have no idea what I am going to do without a heating pad. I have chronic back problems. I pretty much have to have a heating pad all the times. Or I will be in major pain. So far the cheaper ones worked better, even though they fell apart over time. I figured with this one one it would pay for itself in a couple of years or so. ( I go through the cheap ones every couple of years) So, I was willing to fork out $40 for this. I loved it while it worked. Hopefully Sunbeam will correct this problem. Would I recommend this to anyone? No. It's not worth the headache and the waste of money. I guess I will go back to the cheep ones. At least they lasted longer than this one!"
3,Good Poetry in almost good editions,"This could be one of the best editions ever to be found for Dickinson's verse, if the editors had not choosed to arrange the poems thematically, rather than chronologically, as the ""Complete poems"" editors did. The book is divided into three sections, each one of them related to a specific topic: the poet's art, the works of love, death and resurrection. But the numeration is different from other editions, which makes it difficult to use in class, or to discuss in a scholar environment. However, as a home book it is perfect.Some really important poems are not included, such as ""Wild nights"" or ""there's a certain slant of light"", although the selection is quite good in general."
3,Cleverly Humorous,"Understated, the ideas promulgated in this tongue-in-cheek,witty, atavistic guide had us in tears. ""The Code"" isfunnier, though."
2,Common Sense???,Isn't this book about common sense? What is so special about this?Why is Ellen Fein getting divorced? Her own book did not apply to her marriage?
2,"Attn ""Too Nice Girl"" , Before you buy, read this...","A friend of mine (A fellow ""too nice"" girl) reccommended this book to me after I went through a break up. In the begining, I hung onto every word.I was empowered by the authors flowery language and promises of success. I tried the rules and I had a very different effect. I felt manipulative, childish and dishonest. Worst of all, I felt fake. I quickly realized that pretending to be someone I'm not was not the way for me. I wasn't satisfied with a man loving me for an image I created for him. I wanted him to love me for me.So, I read a better book and it's called ""Women who love too much"" and it changed my life.""The Rules"" is a saucy book to take with a grain of salt. If you are ready to find out why you are attracted to the kind of men you are, you might try ""Women who love too much"". It worked for me.~Nice Girl"
3,Love Yourself First,"I think that while some underlying themes in this book are reasonable, even a good idea at times, the specifics and rigidity of each ""rule"" become ridiculous and contrived. They can serve as a reminder to to ""stand in your own power"" and ""not give yourself away,"" maxims that might be useful to many women. Mindlessly following ""the rules"" in some manipulative game would be a poor substitute for believing in, loving, and respecting oneself -- a state of mind which would probably create many similar behaviors, naturally. But you have to start somewhere, right?"
4,Take it with a grain of salt...,"Eleven years ago, I read this book and followed some of the rules. I took the whole book with a grain of salt, and realized why so many women fail at keeping a guy interested.Before I read this book, I would have even considered myself needy. I followed the rules that you should be the one to call, ask a guy out, or be available all the time.I did not follow ALL the rules, because any guy really worth having would see through the lies.However, I think all guys can appreciate the rule ""Don't Expect a Man to Change or Try to Change Him.""If you read the book objectively, it really could help you out, especially if you have trust and/or self-esteem issues.I've been married for ten years. The Rules still come in handy!"
3,Whatever!,"I read this book at the suggestion of my nephew. Good grief. I guess if you've been out of circulation, it's got some good tips. But sometimes you just have to go with intuition."
2,Glad I read this book,"Glad I read this. I think most men know that most women do this stuff unconsciously. The authors seem to brand all men the same suggesting that these manouvers are guaranteed to work, while not taking into account the men out there who have high standards and high character. Men have a lot more power in attracting women... (hot chick with ugly guy, but never the opposite). Women have looks, hence the need to use this book."
3,To be taken with a HUGE grain of salt...,"It does have it's merits, in that you won't be pressuring guys too much, however, I find it very difficult to believe that men find it endearing when you treat them like crap. I think the best way to read this book is as if all that independence and sense of self-worth ISN'T an act to get him. Maybe then you won't be so obsessed with needing a guy after that, either"
1,*Please do not take this book seriously!!,"If you do read this I hope at least you get a good laugh and do not take it seriously. I found this book at work on a book exchange table. I took the book as a joke the moment I picked it up and would break it out once in a while to laugh with my girlfriends about the ridiculous advice that this so-called woman was offering to other women. Advice such as ""don't talk too much,"" I thought this CANNOT be serious. The manipulations that this book advices is seriously dangerous for any and all womens self-esteem and self respect if taken seriously. I am appalled that a woman in this day and age would be offering and profitting off of such sick advice, hopefully if you do read it you will be too. This book is so incredibly backwards I found it hugely entertaining until I saw it in here and saw the 5 star ratings it was getting, that is terrifying. Please find something else if you want to ""get a man."""
2,Interesting book,"I read The Rules when it first came out, and I would feel phony doing a lot of them. It just seems to me the ultimate desperation to read a book to catch a man. See the irony of it? Several reviews said that men ""definitely know what they want"" and so I guess if a man doesn't want YOU The Rules won't work anyway, and if he DOES want you I think he will regardless of whether or not you follow The Rules. I personally would feel uncomfortable with men chasing me all the time. What if you aren't interested in a man and he misinterprets it as you working ""The Rules"" on him (like, oh she must REALLY want me). What a mess THAT would be! If I can't tell a man that I think he's a great piece of work without him getting all freaked out about it and pulling away, forget it.And yes, it DOES scare me to think they work."
5,"Want self esteem, happiness and A husband? Read the RULES","Dear Single Sisters,What can I say? I was a ""Rule Breaker"" for years. And now at32 I'm happy to report as I gaze down at the huge Rock on my fingerI met and will marry the man of my dreams - Thanks largelyto that silly little paperback that taught me to behave withself esteem and truly be a partner to the *RIGHT* man.Sure some of the stuff in the books you have to take with a grainof salt - but if you want to be married [which I did] thenit's survival of the fittest - be the one girl whodoes the Rules in a sea of ""2002 Women"" who haveno clue on how to behave - break Rules and wonderwhy at 42 years of age they are husband and childless.Forget the modern [stuff] out there - Be a Rules girl -as old fashioned as it seems - and be treated likea queen for life. It's your choice ladies - I personallywill opt for being my man's queen - and he's certainlymy King. The Rules work and that's a fact."
1,Oh My God!!,"I'm a late comer to this book, and I wish I was even later. How can you possibly find that right man if you practice these ""Rules""? You should be mysterious during the date by not talking much or asking him questions about himself?! You shouldn't approach a man because it will make you look like that you are an easy catch, thus making you not a very good mate?! You should hang up after ten minutes of talking to him on the phone, because then he will want you more?! OH MY GOD!! This one hit the trash can before I even reached the last page."
1,The only rule is love.,"I do what I want, and in the process, I get the women I want. These rules are another way of over thinking and wasting your life thinking about rules and getting people at your feet. There should be no one with more power in a relationship, only mutual love. Sometimes you just have to accept that someone doesn't like you. It's just the way it is. This book is the way of the weak, and if you ever notice someone following the rules, let them know that you are aware, and if they continue their ways, dump them immediately. Make your own rules."
2,Lets say what it is!,"Reality is that there are many men and women out there who do not have your best interest in their heart.THERE IS SOME TRUTH in some of the advice, and it will work on the dumber kind of guy who doesn't think with his upper body and is blindly unaware of games being played on him. But the question you have to ask yourself is: is there such a thing as a partner who will have your best interests at heart, and do you have theirs in your heart? Can that kind of relationship exist? Or do you have a more pessimistic view of the world where you think you need this book to help you manipulate others and use it to protect against mens manipulation? Or do you feel you should be yourself and that a relationship is about accepting each other as you are? Or do you believe that is just for fairytales and you need The Rules!It's basically the female equivalent of the mens book 21st Century Fox Space Age Pimping."
4,It's all about boundaries,"I like this one because it reminds us as women to establish and guard our personal boundaries. This is not a game, rather a way of determining what you will and won't accept in a relationship. This is a how to book. The lessons aren't easy. Learn how to start relationships the right way and learn a formula for keeping balanced while you stay in that relationship."
3,Take it with a grain of salt,"So many responses to this book! There are some very non-90's ideas in this book, and yes, they are games. The fact that some of the men who responded agree that the techniques work sadden me. But there are some good points. You could look at the book in two ways: 1) It is old-fashioned, manipulate mind-games, etc., etc. or 2) It tells women to respect themselves and try not to want a man so badly that they end up getting hurt if he breaks up with her. And THAT is very, very good advice."
1,100% Pure And Concentrated Evil,And women wonder why some men become misogynists. Why can't women (and men for that matter!) just *be themselves* instead of having an agenda? I am all for self-esteem but this book is exactly the *wrong* thing for relationships between the sexes.
5,The Rules!,It is very easy to read. I really enjoyed it. Now let's apply what's in there and see the results!
2,Millennium Reality,"Contrast the Rules with Nita Tucker's How Not to Stay Single, which I find a much wiser book. Ms. Tucker writes in the chapter about rejection, ""If they're not interested, they won't tell you directly. They'll tell you the same way you tell other people -- by not making time."" By her book, the Rules are actually polite rejections!So are the Rules really wise screening-in, or foolish screen-out? Put it this way, if the man who wants to date you is confident, competent, loving, romantic, other women would like him, too. He might not get to the 4th phonecall before moving on towards someone who does show interest and return calls."
3,Love In The Proper Places,"These are the ""rules"" some women attempted to follow to find and marry Mr. Right, not knowing that in actuality, there is no such thing. If the marriagable woman does as she is instructed in this little nonsensical manual, she must follow a simple working set of behaviors to make her irresistible to the right kind of men, not just anyone.This book claims to be ""networking"" for success in making a real, lasting marriage and not just loveless mergers. These suggestions may have come in handy back in the Forties and Early Fifties, but not today. We women are liberated individuals and the men are not as worthy of our attention as at that innocent social time. We must be careful just whom we choose and whom and how we love him. Stick with a real man and you won't be disappointed in any way. Sex is not love, but men need it more than the wife. Be accomodating to a point, but be your own person and demand your ""space."""
2,"Great performances, poor recording","Buy this CD only if you have one hand free for your volume control. Ax's terrific performance is marred by the unacceptably low recording signal that will require you to turn up your playback volume on the pianissimos, then turn down the volume on the orchestral fortissimos... Not the sort of audience participation the performers had in mind."
4,A good option for your DVD viewing,"This is a thoughtful, simmering drama about a man struggling to start over and do the right thing, with a strong yet nicely understated performance by Kenneth Johnson. Rainn Wilson has a small but solid role as the cousin who reluctantly lets Frank live in his garage, so long as nobody can see him. If you're tired of crime films with lots of action and little else, here's a grownup character-driven film with an engaging story."
5,noir in L.A.,"Made on a shoe-string budget, giving a fresh twist to a old story about a change of heart, ""Few Options"" portrays a man and his environment in the 'noir' palette. The portrait is compelling, the story well written, and the style lean and robust. A fulfilling viewing experience."
3,Over Told Storyline,"Positives: Well acted, written, directed and filmed.Negatives: A bit too many formula characters i.e. convenient role stereotypes of friends, relatives, prostitutes over-the-top bad guys and the following:(a.) A story that's been told too many times of someone leaving prison after being the fall guy for others in a crime gone bad.(b.) Usual social and bureaucratic hurdles in adjusting to civilian life.(c.) The usual low paying job resulting in having to take on another criminal task in order to survive.(d.) Predictable criminal task, his targets and his decision making outcome.(e.) Filmed mostly in a garage and parking lot. Although, in defense of the writer/director, the story largely revolves around the decisions of our lead character so settings are not as critical to the story."
2,BE CAREFUL WITH THIS,IF YOUR DOG EARS AARE EVEN SLIGHTLY SENTSATIVE THEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO YOU IT . THE CHEMICALS CAN BE STRONG AND CAUSE PAIN AND ITCHING
3,Interesting movie,I had to watch this for my lit class after watching the movie. I enjoyed it but it was very different from the book. I would definitely recommend reading the book first.
1,Waste of film.,"I spent three grueling hours thinking something would happen to redeem this film from the dredges of the earth. When the credits finally rolled, I realized I was duped. Oprah Winfrey has given some fine performances. This was not one of them. I can honestly say, it is the worst film I have ever seen."
4,It's so hard to do a book of this density justice...,"but they do make a good go of it. Winfrey's acting, the sets, the costuming-- all of these things are fabulous. I'm not sure that you would understand where Beloved comes from if you haven't read the book, or where she goes. I'm also not sure you quite get the relationships between women, which are crucial, in the movie. You also miss the difficult but genius ""middle passage"" section of the book. BUT I know, books and movies are different.This is a ghost story, and just didn't leave me feeling creepy enough. I don't know what would have been better, but something was missing of the chills down the spine variety. Still, this is a great movie, and I think Oprah's version of the ""tree"" on Sethe's back is probably worth watching the movie for in itself. And, one thing that made sense finally for me which I didn't get in the book was when the men ""took her milk."" A big lightbulb went on in my head-- oh!! So it's definitely a watcher, if not a ""buyer."""
1,Read the book don't watch this movie,"I have read a lot of Toni Morrison's work and I can say it is a challenge to transform her unique poetic prose into film, so I can hardly blame Winfrey and Demme for failing with this story. But no one should be subjected to this unless they find enjoyment in seeing people being tortured. Why Oprah would choose a director whose claim to fame is ""Silence of the Lambs"" to direct this flick is a mystery to me. He misses the mark by a mile, fails to make the narrative happen in this movie. And don't get me started on drooling, retarded-acting Thandie Newtown, she was downright embarrassing to watch. She sounded like Darth Vader when she said her opening line. Kimberly Elise is the only one who knows and becomes her character. Note to Oprah, if you want to make a film on a Toni Morrison book next time try ""Tar Baby""!"
1,Vulgarity was over the top,"This movie could have been deep, but the vulgarity of action and speech always went one step too far and was distracting. The lack of flow made it even more painful to watch."
5,Why not French,"This excellent film, of great interest to students and native speakers of French, does not seem to include options for either French dialogue or French subtitles. This is an unfortunate oversight. What about Canada? Don't native speakers of English have an obligation to respect the bilingual reality of Canada? Both options should be standard under Canadian law."
4,completely absorbing,"I watched this movie 2 days prior and am still thinking about it. I imagine I am doing so because it was so completely unexpected (the storyline) and very different. To have the story of slavery meshed with the the supernatural was something I had never seen. The young lady that played Beloved was very ""bewildering"" and vivid in her portrayal...I think in some aspects that Danny Glover was even better as PaulD than was Oprah's performance, even though she was of course good. Definately the strangest movie I have seen to date. It was a little hard to follow at times, but after a lot of thought afterwards and discussion with another that had seen it, a lot more made sense. This movie really made you think...."
2,Dont waste your time and energy,"Three hours of my life has been wasted. I kept trying to like this movie, I kept waiting for it to make some sense. But, alas, it did not. If you must see this, rent it, so when its finally over you can take it back so it wont take up space in your home. Oprah, please, you're better than this!"
1,It's too much of the wrong things,"Slavery happened! Millions of people died for the material gains of a few. Europeans from England, France, Spain, Portugal, Holland, Belguim and a few other countries went all over the world stealing, raping and killing. The enslavement of Africans needs discussion. The virtual genocide of Native Americans needs discussion. The depletion of Africa needs discussion. But I do not need to feel like it is happening to me in order to do so. The choices of the director of this movie put us in that time and in that place. I will not spoil it for those who have not seen the movie, but there is one image in particular that years later still traumatizes me. I do not need to relive personal traumas to be aware of the traumas of others. Its just too much. And, when the pain is too great honest dialogue rarely happens."
5,Should be in your library,"Simply stated this book should be in every Christian apologist's library. And since every Christian should be an apologist (1 Peter 3:15), it should be in every Christian's library. I have found this book most helpful in knowing how we have the Bible and the care that has been taken by God and man to keep it available for all. The men who penned this work, A General Introduction to the Bible, seem very well qualified to provide us the information contained in it."
4,Excellent source for Non-mythos stories,"Coming Full Circle is yet another excellent sourcebook of Lovecraftian horror produced by Pagan Publishing. This book contains a wealth of game-related material on the more legendary myths of New England. Here the witch, the phantom, and the vampire of ancient legend take center stage to the sanity- blasting eldritch horros of the Cthulhu mythos. Additionally, this sourcebook offers great material for psychic investigators (ala late Fox show ""Millenium""). I highly recommend this book for serious players and readers of Lovecraftiana."
2,Not worth it ...,"There's a reason, I think, why tracks are ""previously unreleased""--they weren't worth releasing in the first place! I have yet to hear a ""previously unreleased"" track from *any* singer, and Amos' tracks on this maxi single are no different. And the last edit of ""Talula""is ... painful."
2,New bulb within 2 years!!!,"I wouldnt buy one of these. I just replaced the bulb after less than 3 years of use. It is between $120 and $180 for the bulb. RIDICULOUS!! Picture and sound are good, but who can afford this much maintenance on a flippin TV for cryin out loud!!"
5,4 Years 1 Blub,"So far so good i have the Sony 42 rear projection.(kdf42w655) I am the type of person to fall asleep with the tv on and its been 4 years same first bulb, no blue spots and a great picture."
5,"Great Picture, Nice Features.","I too (re)searched many tv sets in the past 6 months before settling on this Sony. Great Choice! The setup is not that complicated, you won't break your back moving it, HD tuner built-in, everything you would expect from much higher price LCD TV's. And it is still a Sony!!The PIP is great, sounds great even before I installed the sony home theater. HDMI for future digital connection.Overall, I feel great that after 1/2 a year of reading reviews, visiting stores, comapring prices online, that I made the right decision on getting this set."
1,Sony what happened???,"Bought this TV IN 2005 Spent alot of money on it now i get blue blotches all over the screen and i replaced the lamp already, not what i expected from Sony their quality really took a nose dive. Shocked."
1,SONY DLP WGE 655,I had the same experience- TV was great for 2 years then the right hand side of the TV started to turn blue- a month or two later there are hundreds of blue dots all over the middle of the tv screen. I will be lucky to get a couple more months out of it and then I will have to buy a new tv. I certainly am not going to spend any money on repairing this thing. I called Sony- they said this was a common problem with this model but since I am not under warranty it will cost about $1000 to fix. I think I will pass and buy a Samsung. DO NOT BUY THIS TV!!!
4,"WOW, I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE THIS FILM, BUT I DID!!!!!!",my sister rented the movie and she watched it. Then she handed it over to me telling me it was excellent. I read the title and ASSUMED it would suck.....Boy was I wrong. This turned out to be a very enjoyable and entertaining movie. i had fun watching it. I loved it. Its great. Its not really realistic but who cares. Its fun that way!
5,"Interesting style, cameos-o-plenty, great odd movie.","A young boy leaves his rough home life and attempts to win the Motorama contest. He steals a car and collects game pieces at gas stations. His trek is dreamlike with odd characters and situations, some of which are a bit brutal. I liked the many cameos but you have to know your musicians to spot them all. Over all the film has a great look and an interesting soundtrack by Andy Summers (Police guitarist) and a twist at the end."
2,Different yet Hollywood ruined it,"I am kind of in the middle of the other reviewers. It DID have a ""different"" and unpredictable story line. i took it that he was dreaming, since the state names and money werent real. the kid was great. the problem, as usual, is Hollywood ruined it...what could have been a great movie my kids could watch, they throw in a sex scene in the kid's car back seat while he is sitting next to the car, and then of course they have to have the kid throw in a couple of ""F"" words. And of course Hollywood doesnt let us who object to that buy a version that has that edited, or permit DVD players that allow you to skip those parts. if it wasnt for the trash above, i would give it 4 stars for its uniqueness. If you are morale and have children, you dont want this movie."
3,"It's a very old Wilbur, but still entertaining",My daughter loves Wilbur but the older videos are not nearly as good as the new ones on TLC. It's entertaining though.
4,Good Stuff,"I would recommend this book to the beginner. It repeats alot of its defenitions of signs which is a big help. This language contains many signs. The book is defintely not a high level view. It gets down to the nuts and bolts. It has answers in the back of the book with all exercises.My only complaint is that is deals with funneral stelae only. There is not any every day life writings used in the chapters. Also, it doesn't explain some of the odd logic behind the stelae. But otherwise, I've found it helpful as someone who wants to go to Egypt and be able to read some of what he is seeing."
5,"Must-read, exquisitely crafted stories of black life.","""Lost in the City"" is simply the best collection of short stories about life in African America to be published in the last decade. It may well be the best collection of fiction centered in the nation's capital to be published in the past 50 years. Synopses reduce the poetry of these tales to cliches. You have to read these journeys to witness how and why Edward P. Jones requires more than book-priced ""tickets"" to view a few poignant inner lives; he wants us present and aware for the whole heartbreaking, strengthening ride. If you love black people or just want to understand us better, ""Lost in the City"" is a must-read."
4,a view into the capitol,"This collection of short stories brings to life the residents of inner city Washington, D.C., their strengths and foibles, hopes and dreams, passions and errors. Jones creates a compelling cast of characters, from old women in Bible studies, to shopkeepers, criminals, and parents.The first few stories lacked the depth to allow the reader to care for or feel deeply for the character. But by the fourth story in the book, Young Lions, this changes. The reader sees and experiences the world through the perspective of a criminal. Subsequent stories take the reader into various households and families, showing the inner workings of kin, neighbors, and enemies in the city.Some stories are sad, others heartwarming, but all are real. The heroes are important people, who make up the heart of Washington, but who find themselves represented in literature all too rarely. An important book, especially for those who live in or have a connection with the capitol city."
2,Extension Phone Ringer,"I needed a louder telephone ringer, and purchased this item. I tried it when it arrived, but discovered that it was not any louder than the ringer in the phone. Also, there is something rattling inside the item, but it doesn't seem to interfere with the use of it----just shoddy workmanship. I would not recommend it for someone who wants a lound ringer, because this just doesn't do the trick. It would work fine for an added ringer, in a room without a telephone, but that's about it. For the hard of hearing, it's not too good."
4,works just as described,"Used it as a outdoor ringer, works great and has the ability to connect a phone to it."
5,Can't pass this up,"This watch is beautiful. I bought it to replace my old Tag which was more than twice the price and not near as timeless with a stunning deep blue background and large face. You will not be disappointed, and, of course, it comes has all of the classic Tag features with a great link band and waterproof up to 300M."
5,Older book but still the best there is.,Excellent book which can stand by itself to make the light dory but a proper set of plans would be advisable. These are available from Payson's website but it is not an easy page to navigate nor can you buy/pay at the web page. You have to print out an order form and snail mail it in. Amazing how much that interferes with getting the plans.
3,Inferior Master,"I've been looking for a CD version of this album for a long time. It's hard to find to say the least. I saw this release and quickly bought it.Immediately I could hear it was a vinyl transfer with dips and pops and the like. Then I compared the tune ""Dreamland"" on this disc with the version from the ""Jaco Rare Collection"" CD, and it's clear they bumped up the loudness and eq'd most of the high airiness out, no doubt to mask the vinyl source.The Japanese version of ""Dreamland"" is beautiful to listen to, with real airy presence and clear soundstage. I don't even really consider myself an audiophile, I don't have super-expensive gear or anything.But I do care about the quality of recordings because I can tell the difference."
5,An absolute must for any child.,"We watch Curious George on tv every morning. On road trips she would ask to watch him,but we didn't have any videos of him. When I found the Curious George videos on Amazon, it was like striking gold. These videos contain multiple episodes totally 90 minutes of enjoyment. She loves them and it occupies her."
3,Small note.,"I have both Complete Savoy and Dial Studio Sessions [BOX SET] from Savoy jazz label,but also Complete Dial sessions and Complete Savoy sessions from Definitive label too.Complete Savoy and Dial Studio Sessions from Savoy has better sound, but on songs Groovin' high (number 107 on this Definitive cd)All the things you are (108) and Dizzy atmosphere (109) is sound on this cd much better then on Savoy version."
5,Love it,Great product! It was delivered in ample time and it came out perfect when it was installed. It lights up when I turn on my headlights.
5,Unforgettable characters make this a MUST READ,"This book is told from an autistic kid's point of view, which makes it unlike anything else I've ever read. He lives in a rough neighborhood and unwittingly gets himself into a whole mess of trouble. The only person who can help him is his volunteer Big Brother, who has his own problems to deal with. I wish I could meet all of the characters in this book and go out for late-night pancakes to hear their stories all over again. Great story + great characters + humor + heart + grit = ZigZag. Read this book and root for this kid."
5,Can we say change of attitude!!!!,"After watching the series nonstop since the beganing and yes having everyone pretty much on tape this is my favorite. Its the first time SailorMoon, Serina, actually stands up and fights without flaking out."
2,OH PLEASE!!!,"This video is a beautiful story about how the four other scouts and Prince Edymon give their lives for their princess and how Princess Serenity gives her life to protect the planet she loves. Oh, wait, that's the real version. The American version is a half done piece that censored so much stuff out of the final episode that it was cut down from a two parter to a one parter. The original Japanese version was a masterful piece of work that was extremely emotional and dramatic and what has been left over after the Americans went scissor happy is a poor rendition. However, if you haven't had any experience with the original work, then this video is awesome."
5,This one is one of the best ones,"This movie is one of the best movies i've seen (even though it's kinda short) it's definetely a good buy. I think everybody (well at least all sailor moon fans) should have it. I loved ""Day of Detiny"". It has a suprise ending, but i won't spoil it by telling you what it is. ""The Past Returns"" was also really good. It helps you understand the show more. END"
5,Excellent Book !,"I purchase this book out of curiosity and I can't put it down, I love it. There is so much of good information on it if you are serious into learn the how to and why and the structure of a spells this book is for you. Information is clear and easy to follow anybody can do it."
3,kelly clarkson,she is so good at singing i love her voice i am not a fan but she is good and i do have to say she is geting very nasty for kids she is dressing very unapropreate but she is very good at singing thats why i give her song a 3 star hilary duff is very good and MORE apropreate for kids
2,not so great,"The package arrived squished. The product itself was dusty and seemed used, like it had been used and then shoved in a warehouse."
1,Wigfield: The book that does not...,"Wigfield: The book that does not entertain or make you laugh. If only Amazon gave refunds on books. To be honest, I only made it to page 46 and just could not go on. This is the most boring book I've ever made the mistake of attempting to read. OK, as a fan of Stephen Colbert, I bought this book and was expecting some good laughs. Instead I just cant believe it was published. Colbert fans: Go watch the Daily Show - just dont waste your time with this book!"
5,"Hilarious,clever book!","This book is really funny..of course I'm a little biased I guess because I ADORE Stephen Cobert,Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello.They were all in the cast of Strangers With Candy,a genius comedy sitcom. I have the whole series box dvd set & love it to pieces!The book uses a lot of the same type 'inside joke sarcasm' humor that Stephen uses on his show The Cobert Report.If you get & appreciate his humor,you'll love this book. I love it! Crazy funny pictures too! LOL!"
3,Moving Dial Hands,"I had the same problem with the moving hands with the Citizen E812. I read in a watch forum they would replace the internal parts so that you have to pull it out one click before movement occurs. If the watch is under warrantly they would do it free, if not then it was a 30 dollar charge.I sent my E812 to Citizen in California and they replaced it with the E820 system. I hope this helps someone since it was driving me crazy also.I do not know if they would do it for this watch but it can't hurt to contact them."
2,READ THIS IF YOU LOOK FOR TITANIUM WATCH,"Many people already wrote nice reviews and included a lot of information. I will only add few words.I am really very dissapointed with this 'Titanium' watch.The biggest issue is that it's not at all 'ALL TITANIUM'.Back of the case is made of steel. Beware.So if you look for some anti-allergic or real 'All Titanium' watch, don't go for this item.Unfortunately I only found this out when I looked at the back of the watch.The other thing that is annoying and you would not expect this from the watch with the list price $450 is that Seconds hand does not align with the markers at all.Also, althought smaller, this watch seems to be heavier then Skyhawk."
3,Pretty good.,"Pretty good , the instructions left something to be desired and were not real clear and it works just fair."
5,What I needed...,"This is exactly what I needed, but found out that there was a wing nut completely rusted on the bolt I needed to take off to fix my problem. So, I still have a toilet that is not usable. Guess I will need to go out and make a big purchase of a new toilet."
5,"The time Star Trek got an idea from ""Alien"".","This was one of the best first season TNG episodes. It was something quite unique and different in the Star cannon: a gory, terrifying descent into madness by way of bug eating, back stabbing (figuratively and literally), and true conspiracy theories. The video cover picture on Conspiracy of Riker pretty much sums the episode up. Well, of course, so does the infamous exploding head scene. Is there any other Star Trek episode that you can say that about?"
1,disappointed,"This recording is the same inferior RKO Masters album with a different title and Peg O' My Heart added as the last track.The RKO Masters recording is worse than a bootleg recording and ,by far, inferior to the quality work The Harmonicats have released. A waste of money."
1,Organic Aromatherapy Buckwheat Pillow,Overpriced. Could be more pliable and a little larger. This is as hard as a rock. Not at all what I expected. Total rip off. No quality here.
5,love it!!!!!!!!!!,"Never heard of a product like this, but after installing tie rod ends with the grease fittings in the back (up against the frame), I researched the alturnitives and bought this coupler. It is so easy to use and has already paid for itself....I love it!"
1,I could not get it to work,"I could not make this Thexton 418 work. I tried it on several fittings and each time the grease just shot out the end of the coupler. I tried several different positions, but still could not get it to work at all. I finally gave up and put the old coupler back on the NAPA grease gun I have been using since 1975 and it worked just fine.I just threw the coupler in the trash as it was not worth sending it back to Amazon. Other people have given this coupler great reviews, I am not one of those people."
3,On the Fence,"I ordered this to get at the u joint on my ATV. I decided to attach this to one of those ""mini Pistol"" cartridge guns. I have not tried it out on the intended fitting but did use it on my lawnmower spindels. About half the grease never gets into the fitting. It is somewhat messy and does not seem to provide a good tight seal like a standard fitting does. Time will tell if this works on the intended purpose. As a regular grease fitting- this is not the best choice, as a tight space speciality fitting- this should get enough grease into those impossible to reach fittings."
1,Don't buy,"I bought one in 2008, and did not use it until today June 2011.Have a leaking toilet. Found the problem, and thought I should use a new valve with this leak protection. After almost 2 hours testing the leak protection, found out this Fluidmaster leaks on top, and the leak protection mechanism wasn't working. The water runs when it shouldn't be, according to the instructions. I remember getting this to work in another toilet back in 2002. So, something changed. I noticed the original valve in the toilet was ""American Standard"" brand, and everything looks very similar. Even the holes where the leak protection part can be installed. Installed the leak protection onto the ""American Standard"", changed the washer/seal into the new one.And the leak protection worked.If you can get this ""American Standard"", go for it. I don't have the receipt from Home Depot, and after 3 years, I don't think they will take this back."
4,"Spotty coverage, some regions covered great some sorely lacking","This is a good book, but note that it is a advanced wine buyers guide, do not really expect this guide to be of much help at your local grocery store wine section.If you are just starting out there are better books to start with, get this book when you have caught the wine bug and are ready to invest more in your wines.If you are serious about your wines and willing to spend $25 and up wards for your wine then this is a must have. I would suggest this as a third or later wine book in your collection.1/2 star taken away for outdated coverage, most wines reviewed here are of vintages really hard to find in 2005.1/2 star for spotty coverage of regions like South Africa, New Zealand and Australia."
4,every one must have this,"My friend recommended this book highly and she recommended a great new beverage that replaced my morning cup of joe. Caffeine made me too jittery so I switched to a soy-based coffee that taste simply amazing. When I use my percolator it comes out with a rich, full bodied taste. Search under ""S oyfee"" on google to find it."
4,Cute and Interesting,"While far from being the best Pele single- that honor goes to the ""Hey Jupiter"" EP- this is a cute and interesting CD.CAUGHT A LITE SNEEZE: A great song, worth buying the CD for. good song to own.THIS OLD MAN: A haunting rendition of the nursery rhyme. Tori's voice glides beautifully and creepily over the simple lyrics.THE SANDWICH SONG: One of those songs you really have to be in the mood for- it's.... shall we say... odd. A cover of a song by the same duo who wrote ""London Girls,"" which Tori covered on the US ""Talula"" single. Cute in a wierd way.GRAVEYARD: Beautiful and too short.TOODLES MR. JIM: A sweet and sad improv in the classic Tori tradition- I love the spoken words added at the end.All in all.... If you don't know Tori, chances are you won't like this CD. But, it's a good addition to any Tori fan's collection!"
4,Peanuts double feature,"I purchased this for a friend as a replacement. My VCR ate the original tape. Peanuts is classic, although as I have gotten older, maybe a little corny. I really wish this little gem was available on DVD."
1,Worst TV I ever Bought,"Around June 2007, I bought a Philips 37 LCD TV, The quality is just so, After less than 5 month, the TV is dead. There is no picture.I have bought so many TVs in the past 20 years. This is one with the shorted life.TV Serial Number: BZ3A0636461733"
5,Changes have been made,"I just purchased one and the problems mentioned before about the labels have been taken care of. Perfect picture and a very good price, could not be happier with my purchase."
5,Loads of info,"I really enjoyed reading this one. It gives good information about the breed, its history, specific characteristics if Maine Coons and has some nice pictures showing good examples of this breed."
2,Ultimately Pointless,"I had fun playing this game, even though the cut scenes were way too long (20 minutes, at one point!). The nice thing is you can pause the cut scenes if you need to. My complaint is the lazy lack of an ending. NOTHING is tied up at the end, except one important task is completed. Then the game basically tells you to stay tuned for the next game. That's lazy and greedy, in my opinion. If they wanted to do another Runaway game, it could have had a different plot, or they could have made this relatively short game longer. By the way, this game was published in 2006, and I just checked the Pendulo website, and no new Runaway release is on the horizon for 2008, so I wouldn't hold my breath waiting to find out how Brian's wacky adventure ends."
2,"Might be fun, but stopped working on my PC","I got a couple of chapters into this game and then disaster struck. Every time I try to start the game, it either prompts me to insert the DVD (which is there) or my PC locks up and I have to power it off and reboot. I have given up on it at this point.This is definitely a story and dialog game. If you like lots of dialog, i.e. going back and forth to different locations talking to people about a billion things, then you would like this game. It is also an ""inventory"" game, i.e. you collect things in your inventory and then have to figure out how they expect you to combine them or use them on things in your environment (like putting butter on a cable so you can unfasten it).I prefer games with more puzzles and less talking (like the Myst series), so perhaps I'm not missing much with it not working for me anymore."
1,Awful reliability..,"My wife has had this thing for 4 years, and it break once a year almost on the nose. I am tired of sending it in for repair and consider this planned obsolescence from Solano. I will never buy another prooduct from them again, quality has gone downhill since Newell took over. There is ZERO excuse that a person (not a hair dresser drying several heads a day) should have issues with this expensive dryer every year.Went with a Sedu 6000i and it has lasted with no issues over the same period of time. There are better options in the high end hair dryer market look elsewhere because this product doesnt' last.PS- notice another review here (Fifey) in this chain of reviews, is on their second one! Anyone who spends $120 on a hair dryer and uses it lightly shouldn't have to buy another one, and most CERTAINLY shouldn't have to repair it annually."
4,Solano 3200 Hair Dryer,"Arrived when promise. And a good investment. Works Great. I will recommends to friends. I only wish the hook was made of stronger plastic, but I can live with it. Filter is easy to take off and very easy to keep clean. Thanks !"
4,perfect for any Kindergartener learning Hebrew.,My son and I have found this very useful for learning beginning Hebrew. It is for conversational Hebrew as opposed to Biblical.
5,One gorgious film!,"This is Walt Disney's first full live action film and it is a gem. It's beautifully filmed in Technicolor with excellent detail and is rather accurate to the original novel, unlike the black and white MGM film. Bobby Dricoll as Jim Hawkins is strangely American in a film populated by British actors, but he is an excellent actor and won a junior Oscar for the role. The scene where he is chased by the pirate up the mast is unusually dangerous and violent for a Disney film and I love that the danger in the story is not watered down in any way. Overall this is a beautifully made film that does justice to the source material."
5,The Return of the Bottle,"From youth to age I cast in a bottle on the sea of time. The message isand was that Treasure Island was and still is my favorite live action drama from Disney studios. Bobby Driscoll as Jim Hawkins and Robert Newton as Long John Silver are every bit as mesmerizing as I remembered. This was not a ""pieces of eight"" experience."
3,"satisfactory, but disappointed","The movie/disc itself was fine. But the case was damaged and won't stay closed. Not what I expected when paying for a ""new"" movie."
5,"Vista Good, Linux Good","This scanner is listed on the Canon Support website as being compatible with Windows Vista, as well as having ""complete"" support under GNU/Linux with the plustek driver on the SANE project website."
3,It could have been so much better,"So far I have only watched two of the three disc's, the car chase one and the fast cars one.Each has been roughly 50 minutes long, so all three discs could have been put onto a single disc. Getting three had such possibilities for lots of content.The car chase disc was perhaps one third of interviews and theory from poice officers about the kind of training they get, what I really wanted was car chases. The quality of the picture at times is poor, but as the footage is from mounted cameras in patrol cars this is fair enough.The fast cars disc featured only three cars, not really an overall view of ""fast cars"" but is still worth looking at.A three DVD box set could have been really cool, instead it seems rather diluted."
1,don't buy this set!,"I was excited to buy my first audio bible only to find the sound quality poor, the orchestration horrible and distracting from the Word. Instead of a group of actors playing Biblical figures, it seems there may be about 4 people doing all the roles. I think I could of lived with the dramatization but the music is so bad that I kept asking why the makers of this thought the score was good? It would of been better for them to put classical music in the background, at least it would have been a nondistracting score. Please people, listen to a sample of this before purchasing it!"
5,"Tragedy strikes Valerie again, Jonas is missing.","Three years after being married Valerie is trying to find herself as an individual. She finally gets Jonas attention in San Francisco. They finally are a happy couple when tragedy hits them again. Jonas is missing and Valerie has a great secret to tell him, but is afraid he'll never know. A must read. Please continue this series."
3,Symphony NOT in Motion...wish it would have lasted,"We received the Symphony in Motion mobile for a shower gift and I was really excited because it looked like a great entertaining toy for our baby. I was a little disappointed to discover how loud it was and how low it hung in the crib, but once my son was born and I saw haw well it held his attention I was willing to put up with that. Then, just when we were beginning to realize how much he loved it because he was starting to coo and babble (at 6 weeks old) the motor quit. The music would still play, but no motion at all. I returned it for a new one, only to find that one broken in the box. I then checked out some online reviews and learned that it's a very common problem for the motor to quit, so I decided to buy a different brand instead. I gave this 3 stars because my son liked it so much, but the quality just wasn't there."
5,My Baby LOVES IT,"I have this mobile since my baby was born, she is now 3 months old and she stills loves it!!!. When she was a new born she got relaxed with the music and now she follow the animals and talk to them. At night whe she is tired she falls sleep listening to the music.I guess every baby has their own personality some will like some won't. let's hope that if you get this for your baby he/she will love it as my girl does.Also if you care about giving a little more to yopur baby, babies enjoy the black and white color, they can not see shapes very well so this spirals call their atention very well."
4,Baby loves it!,"My baby loves this, we bought a few days ago and she watches it for the full 15 minutes and more. She is 7 weeks old and is mesmerized. I didn't realize it but the dolls have counterweight balls that help it rotate under it's cone while it rotates around the tilted axis. Plus the sliding shapes on top give more for her to watch. It makes even more interesting to watch. It does not appear to have a silent feature as said in reviews, but we love the music and can't complain.update Feb. 12, 2011I knocked it down from 5 to 4 stars. We still love it but it is not impressive to me as the v-tech dream & play mobile which is hard to find in the USA from what I can tell. The features that the v-tech has which tiny love does not is very good volume control which can be adjusted from loud to very faint or no sound. The other feature I'd love to see is motion control feature that plays soft music and has a soft light that comes on."
4,Great Mobile,"I really like this mobile. It keeps my 13 week old infant entertained and she also falls asleep to it from time to time. She gets so mesmorized by it that she will fall asleep. My only problem with it was the first one they sent me did not work but Amazon does such a great job with returning it that all I had to do was email them that it do not work and they sent me one right away to replace it and all I had to do was print the label out and postage and everything was taken care of, just had to drop it off at the post office. I actually got the replacement within 4 days so that is pretty good. They are on top of things."
4,finally sleeping through the night,"I found this mattress very comfortable. The odor was almost completely gone after a few days of airing the mattress out. I can't believe how much better I feel in the morning. I have Fibromyalgia and would have trouble waking up at night in constant pain and having to change positions frequently, but with this mattress, I now sleep soundly through the night with much less pain in the morning. I have noticed that the mattress retains my heat and have had to adjust the temperature in my room to keep it cooler. It'll be great in the winter. I did notice that one side of my mattress is softer than the other, but I am comfortable on both the firmer side and the soft side."
4,Awesome Mattress!,"It's very hard for me to fall asleep and I always wake up multiple times in the night but since getting this bed, I sleep all night! I can fall asleep quickly and stay asleep! It was hard me to open and bring upstairs but I managed to do it! I didn't notice a chemical smell on my mattress. It takes about 5 hours to fully fluff up to normal mattress thickness. I'm so happy I can sleep all night. I also have absolutely no back pain at all. Its been about 1 month and I'm in love! I highly highly recommend."
5,Worth the money!,"This was my first memory foam mattress and I'm sold! I bought this mattress after looking at the local furniture store and the one I liked was 899 on sale! Got my mattress on Amazon for 529 and couldn't be happier, only complaint was that I needed to air out the mattress for a day because of the chemical smell. I would recommend the mattress to anyone looking at memory foam mattress's."
3,STICKY,"Okay, were so start? this matress is quite obviously too sticky. Why does it stick? I feel like it's SWALLOWING ME when I go to bed. And here's the thing, first night: I slept with my cat. Have not seen cat since. Does not light up like my Pillowright mattress used too. Doesn't come with headboard or catfinder. Temperpedic four words: I WANT MY CAT BACK."
5,Wish I had purchased it long ago!,"I really like this mattress - my first foam one. I had been having back pain with my regular pillow top mattress. Amazingly, the morning after my first night on the foam mattress, I had no lower back pain. The only problem was that my neck hurt. I had to switch pillows since I don't sink in as much with this mattress as I did with my old mattress. It's rather warm, but for me that's ok. I got a waterproof cover for it so I don't ruin it with sweat."
2,Severe outgassing from matress,"The mattress is definitely comfortable, however there is severe outgassing from this mattress. We've had it over one month in a ventilated room, and the smell is still overpowering. After I did some research on the health hazards of memory foam outgassing, I immediately decided we needed to return this mattress. If you do a search on ""mattress outgassing"" you'll find many reports of people who started experiencing all kinds of health problems that went away as soon as they removed their mattress. Other articles associate the outgassing to severe diseases like cancer. No level of comfort is worth these reported health risks, especially for my three little kids, so this mattress is going back. I'll report back on how difficult it was to return this 100lb item."
5,Scary..ily sharp that is!,"Seriously, try not to chop your fingers off with this one. This is one heck of a sharp knife, and it so far has held its edge very well. Definately the most fantastic and fantasticly sharp knife I have ever used.A thought on knife sizes:I had an awful 5"" and 7"" knife from Walmart that I used all the time before I got this, I almost always used the 5"" knife. Due to that fact I thought that a 6"" knife would be a perfect size. Well, now I think I should have spent a little extra money and got the 8"" knife. I really do like the 6"" and it works pretty well but I definately notice that it is a bit small when I am trying to chop an onion or potato."
4,"Easy Transaction, Quality goods","This company shipped quickly, affordably and a brand new item as described."
5,Fantastic Knife,This has to be the best knife that I have ever owned. It arrived very sharp and has kept its edge. I have abandoned all of my four other old Sabatier knives and I use this one exclusively. I plan to buy more of this line of knives.
4,Bulova Women's 96T15 Crystal Watch,"I bought this for mi lady to wear with a nice dress. It is sleek, simple, yet stylish--chic. For it being black and polished chrome/silver(whatever grade of shineyness) it would go with pretty much any color/style dress she has or would pick-up in the future. This was on sale and was, in my opinion, at a great price for what it offered."
4,A watch for every occasion,"I like the watch because it has an understated elegance about it which allows you to wear it whether you are dressed up or casual. I gave it 4 stars because it is sometimes difficult to tell the time.The band is quite long. If you normally wear 7"" bracelets like I do, this band is going to fit very loose. I had to have 4 links taken out. If you want to wear it as a bracelet-type watch it is perfect. If you have large wrists this is also perfect."
4,Bulova Crystal Ladies watch,"Elegant, durable and very unique watch that I purchased for my wife. Of course she picked it out, but I found the best price for it. Ultimately, she could not be any happier with the watch. Of course, the only donwside to an elongated watch with no numbers its sometimes difficult to read the time."
1,Wrong Battery,"Amazon recommended this as an extra battery for the Canon EOS Rebel T2i. It's not the right battery, though. I'm sure it's fine, but it doesn't fit the camera it was advertised to go with."
1,Not worth the time and effort,"I did buy this for a good deal, but getting this thing to work was a nightmare. Almost no helpful documentation is included - make sure you already have an internet connection available so you can find help on how to get this working.After spending a lot of time and frustration trying to make it work, it barely extended any signal. I was very hopeful this would solve some connection issues I was having but this caused more trouble than it was worth."
1,"Spiffy idea, but read if you intend to use with non-LINKSYS equipment","The version of this product currently shipping through Amazon (version 1) is not compatible with non-LINKSYS products such as my Netgear router.The version currently shipping through Amazon (October 05) lacks an ethernet port that is necessary in the configuration of non-Linksys equipment. If you don't have a Linksys router/WAP, you need a version 2...Unfortunately Amazon's ordering information doesn't specify the version number of the product."
3,Fine with a Linksys Router,"Worked fine with a Linksys G wireless router, but when I switched to a DLink router (the Linksys died from a power surge), the Expander become unreliable, frequently dropping the signal & requiring repeated setups. Removing it from the network resolved the issues of daily dropped connections, and it turned out the DLink-655 had enough range I didn't need the extender. Works well if you have a Linksys G wireless router and an area of poor coverage in your house, otherwise don't bother. Also, like other reviewers, I found the setup CD to be not helpful. There is a cat-5 jack on the unit, and plugging it into the router directly then pushing the Auto-configure button (& patiently waiting for the blue LINK light) turned out to be the only way to setup the unit."
2,disappointed in Denver,"glad I bought the used one! Not worth it/older version, no hard-wire connection so very difficult to set up. waste of money."
2,Prepare Yourself foe setup problems,"Aside from the fact the documentation is incomplete and completely inadequate the the CD is useless as is most of the tech help on linksys.com. I got it to work after a number of hours by connecting it to directly to my PC and doing a manual config. If you don't have a reasonably good understanding of networking and security issues avoid this product. Does it work? Yes, it delivers as but it need to be relatively close to your router (at least this was the case with my setup).I think the managers at Linksys should be given this product and asked to install it within 45 minutes on a secure network ...I'm betting 90% them would not make the cut."
3,"Nice idea, but needs more power.","This does expand the range of the wireless signal but not as much as I would like. Dont expect to expand across a home because it bearly reached across two rooms for me. I dont know if there are legal restrictions on signal power but it seemes that current technology should allow further range for a signal expander. 5 stars for functionality, minus two for being weak."
1,Disaster,"This product not only didn't work, the limited installation disk completely reset the protocol settings on my notebook computer. The reason I bought it was because I had one that worked and it failed after 13 months. Find something from another vendor but don't buy this."
1,Total loser of a device. Far below Linksys' usual standards.,"Well, I didn't read enough of these reviews before purchasing this. I've had good experience with Linksys before, but not now, not with this one. It appears that it's only compatible with certain Linksys systems. Bogus. Nothing in the description when you order says this. I have a great Belkin router that I'm not planning to change. Beyond that, the set up utility is worthless and failed to work properly. (Of course, that could have merely been the compatibility issue but it seemed worse than just that. And even if just that, it should have been smart enough to give me an error message like, ""this is not compatible with your setup.)This sucks. It's getting returned."
3,Environment is Everything,"This product, though very hard to set up, does work. The thing is, it needs to sit in a ""sweet spot"" between your router and the receiving device so the router signal isn't too weak, and neither is the extender's. If your home will allow for the extender to be within approx. 30 feet of each device, this can be a great asset. Just don't try to set it up yourself. Linksys tech support was wonderful and friendly. Linksys usability and tech docs are for the birds."
3,Linksys Wireless-G Expander,Great for expanding your exsiting network but every so often I have to set the auto-config. button and what a pain it is for it to sync up to my network. Otherwise it is a worthy product for network range expansion.
1,Doesn't work. End of story!!,"I had this for about a month, and the only time it consistently worked was during the 1st two hours I had it. Besides these two hours, it never worked well. The signal kept getting lost, would get disconnected rougly every 4 minutes. I spent four days in total on the phone with Linksys, which just made things worse, as they reprogrammed my router, making the router nonfunctional (so tech support made things WORSE). I ended up returning it, along with a portion of my sanity..."
2,OK for VERY simple wireless networks,"I had great difficulty setting up the unit. Even after disabling WEP and MAC filtering, configuring the unit to use WEP was annoying. Since you must setup the unit wirelessly (no ethernet connection is available) whatever wireless connection you are using to setup the unit must not be in range of any other wireless domain but your own. Whenever I tried to configure the unit using my wpc54g equiped laptop, my laptop would loose the original wireless connection to my network and connect to my neighbors wireless router instead of the wre54g. Once I got the unit configured it would work OK to extend the network, but would cause my wga54g to lockup after a few minutes, requiring a reboot of the wga54g and my XBOX. After two frustrating days I finally gave up and returned the unit. Oh well."
4,Good Product - Fair Technical Support,"The product is excellent. It provides me a better signal for my desktop computer. However, it's not easy to configure. It took me 2 and half hours on the phone with technicians based out of India to finally get it configured. It was a nightmare. They were to charge me $9.99 for the service until the adapter was configured correctly but I got charged twice because the first technician passed me on to her supervisor since she was not able to solve the problem. Finally, the supervisor got the adapter working the way it was supposed to work. Later I checked my credit card account and saw the double charge. I have emailed Symantec to have the second charge removed but I am still waiting for their reply. It has been two weeks."
1,DO NOT BUY THE RANGE EXPANDER,"Linksys fails to mention that by installing this unit on your wireless network, that it reduces your internet speed in half..A linksys senior tech support person admitted this to me.."
4,Read Richard Garcia below to install,"The product works great, but I agree with all reviewers ... don't read the manual!Richard Garcia's instructions below on Amazon are clear and they work flawlessly. I originally went to www.experts-exhange.com and found no help.You also don't need to put the extender ""halfway"" between your end point and the base. Put your extender at the end of the wireless range and you will have a full signal."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The sales blurbs make it look so easy, press auto config, it'll work out of the box.IT DOESN'T!Forget the cdrom that's included, the 'scan for signal' doesn't work. Useless.The printed instructions are worse. Absolutely useless.I finally got through to Linksys. ""Your router is B, it won't work with G."" ""Why didn't you tell me that in your advertising?"" ""Oh, there's a lot of things B won't work with."" ""And, your router is past the time for help covered by the warranty.""As the other posts note, you'll need a substantial knowledge of wireless technology to ever get it to work. And, unless you have a G router, it probably won't.I don't know what the answer to range extension is. I know for sure, it isn't this Linksys product.Somebody at Linksys obviously reads these boards, they have to know what a piece of unusable junk they're selling.Obviously, they don't care."
1,Does not work at all,"This device might as well be made from concrete for all the good it does. Adding it was a hassle because the configuration software did not work, had to look at forums to find the correct IP address for manual configuration. Once I got it configured and set up it did virtually nothing to add to my network. Expensive and non-functional; just what I was looking for in my tech. Do not purchase this item; it does not work as advertised."
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS,YOU WILL BE SORRY,TOOK MY NETWORK DOWN","FIRST, I AM TECHNICALLYSAVVY AND UNDERSTAND IP ADDRESSES SUBMASK AND PROPEGATION THEORIES. I AM COMPUTER LITERATE. I INSTALL SYSTEMS FOR A LIVING. THIS PRODUCT SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK FOR THE LAYMAN. IT DOES NOT WORK OUT OF THE BOX. FORGET AUTOCONFIGURE. TRIED IT BOTH IN WIRELESS AND ETHERNET CONNECTED.IT SIMPLY DID NOT AUTOCONFIGURE. AND I DO HAVE THE VERSION 2. THEN I TRIED TO USE THE INSTALLATION CD. BIG MISTAKE. IT TOOK OUT MY ROUTER AND ISP. TOOK ME OVER 1 HOUR TO RESTABLISH MODEM/ISP CONNECTION. THE CD FROZE AND CRASHED MY SONY VAIO FS660W BRAND NEW LAPTOP. THIS PRODUCT IS THE WORST PIECE OF JUNK I HAVE EVER TRIED TO INSTALL. I HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WITH NETGEAR PRODUCTS AND HAVE NEVER HAD THESE KINDS OF OUT OF BOX FAILURES. SAVE YOURSELF MANY PROBLEMS AND STAY AWAY FROM THIS HARDWARE."
1,"sorry product, sorry support","The Linksys Wireless-G range expander WRE54G is the worst product I've ever tried to use with my computer. After hiring a computer consultant, I was finally able to get it configured to work. The setup tools did not work and the so-called technical support is worse than nothing. Now after 6 months of use, my device suddenly stopped working alltogether. After 2 hours on hold, the so-called technical support suggested that I buy a new one - the device can't be repaired."
3,Works - eventually,"It does work as advertised. However, setting it up is NOT an evening job. No beer while you're doing it, be well rested; I recommend a Saturday. Plan on at least half the day and two hours on the phone with tech support. I'd like to give it a higher rating, but the setup software is so totally inadequate as to be fraud. Tech support was outstanding though - good thing....Bottom line: Buy it if you really, really need it and you already have an existing Linksys router. Otherwise run away."
1,Linksys Customer Service Admits Product Shortcomings,"I'm a fairly saavy computer user and was unable to get this range extender to work. After a three hour conversation with customer service (read: India), they told me they were unable to help. Also, they candidly admitted that the product has shortcomings and they cannot guarantee correct functionality when WEP is enabled.Unless your name is Bill Gates or you have A LOT of spare time to waste, do not consider buying this product. Really."
1,piece of Junk,"I used this device for several months. It would randomly drop its connection back to the wireless router it was connecting with.Sure the signal was stronger after i installed the Range Expander, but it was less reliable do to all the dropped connections. And yes, I was using latest firmwarebit the bullet and ran wire directly to the room with the week signal and do not regret the effort.This product is not worth the time or money"
1,You sent me one different from whart I ordered!!!!,I certainly wish you had sent me a LINKSYS Range expander.But you sent me a Hawking range expander instead!
1,"Apparently, THEIR ALL BROKE RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX","Look at the reviews and error message documents. Even after I knew what I was getting into, the theme seemed to be: Once you get it going it's fine. On a secured Wi-Fi? Forget it. Unsecured; it keeps timing out. I had a competent network engineer in my office who worked on it for 4 hrs and we both eventually gave up.The Netgear is no good for me because employees will hit the reset button and screw it up for days at a time. So I reluctantly went with a Linksys and it seemed fine for weeks until someone hopped on with a Netgear card and screwed it. I bought a Linksys card and crossed my fingers.The router is alright if you don't mind calling somebody, BUT THE RELAY/EXTENDER IS WHOLLY UNUSABLE."
1,Deception,A total pile of junk! When I got it working it cuts my speed by over 1/2...... give me a break. The reviews were correct. Save your money and get a WAP54G. It works great and won't bring your network speeds down to nothing. The manufacture doesn't play fair in that they don't clearly tell you that speeds will be cut in 1/2 or more. Who needs to do that with a WYFI?
5,Great product!! Works as advertised,I had read several reviews prior to purchasing this product and I got a little scared about the setup. Here's how I did it.I disabled wep on the routerPowered on the expanderPressed the auto config buttonLogged into the expander configured wep on the deviceRenabled wep.Works great and pretty simple config.
1,Absolute Rubbish,"I saw the reviews posted regarding the difficult configuration and chalked it up to probable user error, or people getting an early edition of the product. As a moderately capable software engineer, I wasn't overly concerned about configuring the device and expected by mid June any early production problems would be resolved.I was wrong.Do not buy this device unless you have a full day to dedicate to the configuration. At some point (in my case less than 20 minutes) you will exhaust all the scenarios covered in the scant documentation and will be left with no choice but phone support. This is where you need time, don't plan installing at night or the weekend, as there will be no phone support. Expect to wait an hour or more to speak with someone. After you get connected to someone, then you'll be given the pieces of information necessary for configuration such as the default ip address of the device!"
1,Works great... if you don't want security or support.,"The product worked great with my Linksys access point, as long as I disabled security, and who is dumb enough to do that? Enabling security apparently does not let the expander work. I searched the internet for instructions and followed them (didn't work). I called Linksys tech support. They were worse than useless. The manual is not helpful. And get this: some of the screens on the expander web config were in broken English! I expected far, far better from Linksys. Now where do I go for my network needs?"
1,jumk,"This item is a piece of junk and should never have been sold. It was old, out-of-date and did not work as advertised. I returned it for a replacement and another was sent that didn't work either. I received my money back. Computer Geeks were happy to refund."
5,Great product!,"I have NO computer expertise and I installed this product in 10 minutes to a secured wireless network by following the directions on the CD and brochure. The key to easy installation is READING the directions. No connection issues, no problems. I would recommend this to others."
2,Not worth it,"As other reviews discuss in-depth, this product was difficult to setup. Once it was setup, I found that wireless devices like laptops and iPhone 3G had difficulties picking this device over the weaker Linksys WRT54G wireless router. I think the problem is that this device uses the same SSID as your wireless router. It appears that the algorithm that laptops and other devices like the iPhone 3G use randomly pick either one. So the only time this device will be really useful is if you are completely outside the range of your wireless router but within range of the range expander. It does not perform anywhere near as well as the access points that you see in large corporations. I would suggestion moving to a new wireless N wireless router. Most models also have improved wireless G range over older wireless routers like the Linksys WRT54G."
1,Run Away - Don't just walk,"I'm sure that the people at Linksys are really nice but this thing is a nightmare. Easy to set up if you don't want to secure your network. Impossible to set up if you do. Before you buy, head over to Google and type in ""wre54g"" and ""install"" and ""problem"". Then take three days to read through the results.The only people who like this product are the newbies (who don't understand the need for network security) and the pros (who love a technical challenge). For the rest of us, this product is an extraordinary headache.Flee, flee for your life."
2,Some of these exercises could cause injury!,"Some of the exercises shown in this book, such as the ""Furey bridge) nothing more than a neck bridge taken to extreme) have the potential to do one thing, to hurt you!Be careful and look at the routines and exercises with a grain of salt; do your own research, get informed as some of this is wrong in so many levels.Some of the info and routines are valid, in spite of the shorcomings of this book."
2,Not worth the price,"I bought this book with the understanding this was a full program of bodyweight only exercises. While it does have well illustrated exercises there is not a program except to be your own trainer. Well I need a little more help than that. The author does offer an online forum to ask questions and to discuss training with other members. There still is no ""program"" or really good advice available. The forum is dominated by 4 or 5 members that will not allow anyone to question the author. If you do post a question that the author does not like he will personally email you and ask you to call him so he can find out if you are worthy of participating in his forum. I have purchased several items from this author and strongly advise everyone to stay away, they are not worth the purchase price. Most of the exercises illustrated in this book are available for free on the internet."
3,Miracle 7,"Some good isometric type exercises but definitily not the total package as Phil Cambell's book ""Ready Set Go Fitness"" is."
4,"Good Classic Disney, NOT a waste of money!",This is good classic Disney I remember watching as a child. Johnny Appleseed alone makes the DVD worth buying. Others have commented on it being patriotic because of 9-11 or being politically correct. But it was made WAY before those things were the big issues they are today. It is of course patriotic because they are American folklore. Just enjoy a great set of cartoons and forget about the bad reviews!
3,Childhood Memories Revived,"Four Disney short films about legendary Americans are introduced by James Earl Jones. The first is John Henry, a freed slave who competed against a steam-driven spike driver in building a railroad and died in the effort. One clever aspect is that the story is told by Henry's widow using quilt illustrations.The story of Johnny Appleseed is next, a film made in 1948 which I have reviewed previously in connection with an earlier collection.Then comes Paul Bunyan, which also includes a tale of competing against automation. I guess that's what working men talk about: heroes that can beat the machine. But Paul lost by a tiny margin of error.Finally, the story of Casey Jones, who absolutely had to get the mail train through to the west, despite all obstacles. A rather silly cartoon, but I suppose it is amusing in its way."
2,Watch for PC revisions,"I was hoping to get the original Disney clips from when these ""tall tales"" were aired. HOwever, this DVD has been revised to make it PC especially for the John Henry tale. Too bad we feel the need to redo/repackage everything these days."
5,Best Knives in the World,"More and more, the famous names in knives are being made off-shore. I bought my first set of Henckels and Wusthof knives in 1978, in Luzern, Switzerland, worked as chef in Tivoli Gardens, Copenhagen, and treasured my knives. Chicago Cutlery are great as well, but more and more it's all under license, made in China. These knives arrived, in perfect tradition, sharp and handy as ever."
1,LAME... NO NUDE ANNA!,"I bought this at a discount liquor store, you know em'... Anyway, on the stand, I could see nothing below Anna's face on the cover because they had paper on it covering that part up. She answers 20 ""sexy"" questions, who cares? Who watches adult films for the interesting dialog?Playboy needs to stop putting celebs on the cover who are not photographed in the buff in the magazine!I recommend the Jaime Pressley issue for her fans. It is one of the better Playboy Celebrity issues.Nuff' said!"
4,It never gets old.,"On a day that many might get the new ""Switch"" disc, I suggest ""Shabooh Shoobah"" to everyone. Before they released the world-dominating ""Kick"", they put out three excellent albums, and this is one of them. Their ""Shabooh-Thieves"" era was awesome, and many of these songs are the reason why. If you've only heard ""The One Thing"", I swear the other tracks here are all just as good. ""To Look At You"", ""Spy Of Love"", and ""Black And White"" are all primo INXS. And the last songs like ""Don't Change"" are all as great as the first ones. Again, if you're a fan of the band, especially the earlier years, not getting ""Shabooh Shoobah"" would be a ""Soul Mistake"". Michael can never be replaced."
4,Bring back memories.,"If you like Gershwin,you'll love this disc,which is all Gershwin. I grew up with this music. Turn it on and be transported to an earlier time."
5,Santiago Tears,"If you had an opportunity to see Lagrimas Negras (Black Tears), the intimate and very personal documentary Sonia Herman Dolz made three or four years ago, you'll realize how fabulous this group is. The CDs cover the range and musical depth of the Vieja Trova whose history is almost as old and richly textured as the city of Santiago. I loved it!"
2,"Drago's performance only redeming factor in ""White""","This is one of those Hong-Kong-style action movies with the excessive violence and gimicky stunts. And if you have seen one, then you have seen them all. Billy Drago's (Untouchables, Delta Force II) self-styled mob boss and drug lord portrayal is perfection. He has polished this role into one of his signature characters. He will hold your interest. But the rest of the movie cannot keep up. You get lost in the movie's inability to smoothly span it's large scope. A young Russell Wong (Prophecy II) gives it his best shot as an up-and-coming Triad boss. This movie did not utilize it's strong actors to it's advantage. Worth a look for Mr. Drago's performance only."
3,Warning: Not the full soundtrack,"This is the only thing that came up the first time I ran a search for a FF9 soundtrack, so I ordered it. And I was in for a bit of a disappointment. Be warned, if you're looking for the main music within the game, this is not it. This is mostly music from the FMV sequences, with a few extras thrown in (such as the version of Eiko's theme that incorporates the overworld theme into it and a few Kuja numbers.) It's good for what it is, but it's not what you might think it is."
1,Nine Dollar Shipping and Handling!,Do not know how this happened but I ended up being charged nine dollars shipping and handling on a $.99 item. The shipping package said shipping was $2.40. Very disappointed with both Amazon and this company!
1,This is junk - doesn't wick solder and is 2mm,"This is a 2mm solder wick that does not do a proper job of wicking solder. Important info: this is 2mm wide, not the standard 4mm or 6mm that you are probably used to. 2mm is about the same size that a standard stick of gum is thick (not length or width but thickness). Not big enough to help unless you are in small, confined spaces.Returned."
3,Different type book,This book was not as engrossing as the reviews suggested. It had a strange twist at the end that was kind of clever.
5,"I didn't get the tape, but I have seen all of the episodes","I AM THE BIGGEST MOONIE THIS PLANET HAS EVER SEEN! WHAT THEY HAVE NOT SHOWN IN AMERICA I""VE READ ABOUT!"
5,This is a really good movie!!,"If you love Sailor Moon or are just starting, you will love this movie. I admit it. I'm a big time moonie, and I'm 17 people. I know, I know. You think it's a show just for little kids. I didn't like it too much when I first saw it, but I swear, it grows on you A LOT! Now I love it. And if you do buy it, and find you don't like it, give it to some little kid you know (I can guarantee they will love it). And if you don't know of any little kids, send it to me!! ^.^ But seriously, this movie is really good. It is the climactic finale to the first series, and it is well worth the money. It is very well written, and I recommend it to an audiance of seven and up. I also advise you get the original ""manga"" (japanese comic) series too. The manga is also available through amazon.com. It's good for an age group of (I think) nine and up. Domo Arigato!! -.^ (Thank you very much!!)"
2,"Good, but it could have been better...","I like these episodes, they are probably the best dubbed episodes I've seen, but I don't like the dubbing. Zoisite's death is much better in the original, for an example...."
5,Cool,"I liked this one tons, but my little brother said it wasn't all that. I guess he's not a REAL SM fan after all. the biggest moonie says!"
5,Mysteries by Danielle Rose,"Saw her in concert in New Orleans and was deeply moved and touched by the sincerety of her music. Many of the songs she sang are on this CD but especially liked the song, Agony In The Garden, but I loved them all. She is an excellent singer and musician. Her deep faith and love of God is so evident in her music. I've listened to this CD over and over and each song is unique and insightful. She is my new favorite."
3,Great drills to improve your game!,"This video includes tips for warming-up,stretches,defense,attacking,headers, free kicks,goal keeping, and much more. It covers just about everthing you need to know if you play on a rec or a traveling team. My parents enjoyed watching this video too.I thought this was a pretty good video if you are an intermediate player. If you have been playing on teams for over 7 or 8 years, this video is probably not the best for you. Otherwise, I recomend this video to all the other intermediate players interested in improving their skills. I have been playing for a long time and still find a couple things in this video helpful."
5,A Scooooooooore!!!!!,"Great instructional video really helped practices. As a basketball coach, this was my first year coaching my daughter's soccer team and it really helped. My other two favorite instructional videos are ""48 Championship Basketball Drills"" and any of Lenny Wilkens basketball videos."
5,Super light fixture for the money,"Just got 6 of these lights to replace my low voltage lighting for the front of the house. These fixtures are super heavy, nicely finished castings with a full glass inner globe that will not deteriorate like plastic over several years. The box of 6 weighed over 21 lbs so that puts each fixture at about 3 lbs each. These are all 110v lamps, so these have to be wired using household voltage and either conduit in the ground or underground feeder wire, but if you use either CFL or LED bulbs off a cheap photocell switch, you can have a dusk to dawn system that will use less current than the typical wired low voltage setup. And they wont start to go out after a year or so like the typical 12vdc setups do. And these fixures are made in New Jersey of all places. Way cool."
5,Good attempt at describing the embedded process,"This book was used as a text book at a graduate level class in embedded design at University of St Thomas, Minnesota. I am also a professional embedded engineer (both hardware and software). What this book does the best is to provide a framework for embedded design. There are various examples in the text on the embedded design process via the requirements/specifications/hardware architecture/software architecture/component design/test process.This has definitely impacted both my understand on a theoretical level as well as my design process at work.Highly recommended!"
1,Frustrating - and not just because it's a tough language,"A very frustrating book. No, there's not much in the way of English language Estonian textbooks to compare to, but as compared to textbooks for other languages, this doesn't stack up. The explanations are inadequate, and most passages are only partially translated. The tapes are very nice to have - similar resources on the internet are spoken much more quickly. On the whole, however, this book makes learning Estonian much more difficult and frustrating than it needs to be."
3,Easy Estonian...,"Not a bad book. There are very few Estonian textbooks available, so if you want to learn the language then this is probably a good place to start. However, the explanations are brief and for a language with such complicated grammar, you really don't get enough practise which results in a lack of confidence when actually trying to use Estonian. But the tapes are good and you can really get a taste for the language from that alone. In short, too much information crammed into too short a space. Would be better with more exercises and explanations relating to the grammar."
5,You can't lose with the name Wusthof,"If anyone hinted I may find Wusthof under the Christmas tree or in the beribboned box for my birthday I would smile and pretend .....I didn't hear them. Give me a cleaver or a paring knife, just make it have the name Wusthof!!I'm serious. I am all for jewelry and fragrances as gifts. So why would I expect less just because my gift will go on the kitchen counter, or drawer?"
5,Gets daily use.,Nice all-round balance of a full tang with a nice feel in the hand. And the blade holds its edge.
5,"Great Knife, Great Price",I am a wusthof fan. I lost my paring knife in a divorce. Its great to now have it back!
5,Must-have!,A classic that is essential to any Disney fan's library. I am helping my granddaughter build a library and we had to have Lady and the Tramp.
4,great for policymakers,"Sunstein's book is in many ways ideal for policymakers who want insights into the purpose of constitutions. I'd recommend sending several hundred copies of this to Libya asap. He argues that constitutions should be designed to counteract group polarization and encourage deliberation.Despite my praise, political scientists are probably going to be disappointed with the book. Sunstein's use of empirical evidence is rather thin and anecdotal. He seems a bit too willing to give political leaders the benefit of the doubt, hoping that they do indeed deliberate policy rather than pursue strategic goals. It's still worth reading because the idea of constitutions as mechanisms to encourage deliberation is a worthy one."
2,Not good enough,"Did anyone proof read this book? Nice cover, but filled with grammatical mistakes. With regard to form and content, it's average. But am sure it was ground-breaking in its time. Disappointing."
5,Chasing Moonbeams,"Chasing Moonbeams-chasing love and capturing its essence, these poems provide a window into the soul of a man, revealing his sensual and enduring love for a woman. Some of these poems evoke for me memories of times and places long past, brought back with a sweet poignancy. And in the midst of this collection of moving and sometimes quite erotic poems, the reader will find a surprising gem like the charming and whimsical ""Skinny"", a funny little commentary on our sometimes very ambivalent human behavior. Delightful! Thank you ..."
5,Sweet Debute,"This is Koyanagi Yuki's debute single. This sweet single is filled with beautifully sung notes, and outstanding vocals! If any artist debutes, this is the way to do it! I HIGHLY recommend this love ballad single!"
5,It is cool!,"this is more for girls. first hazel(maron) has to help a arbok who is in love with a wigglytuff? (i read this looong ago.) then the pokemon meet a hot tempered charmander. can they get along? it is a must have for girls who like pokemon and hate the ash kethcum storyline. plus, it does not cost much."
4,For little ones interest in all sort of trasportation,"""On the Move"" exposes little ones to many types of transportation-- trains, planes, cars, buses, space shuttle, boats, etc.. The text is written for very early readers, has large sized text, and is easy to read. The pictures are crisp, colorful and catches the eye, which draws the reader in. Our household loves to read DK books because the pictures are very interesting. My small complaint about ""On the Move,"" is that 1 or 2 of the photos(the tractor and helicopter specifically) are across both pages making it difficult to enjoy the whole image because of the crease in the middle. It is a small complaint, because the text for ""On the Move"" is great and the pictures are fantastic."
1,Terrible ! Do Not Buy This Game.,"The title says it all, avoid this crappy game. It has the graphic sophistication of (maybe) Quake 2, will not work with Vista until you disable the high end graphics, wont support more than 1280 resolution..There appears to be no way to skip the cut scenes, which is annoying.I've given up on this pile after an hour and since there is a no returns policy on open games where I bought it (Fry's electronics - I need to stop going there, the other item I bought was also a dud) I shall have to chalk this one up to my stupidity for a spur of the moment buy. Should have waited and checked out the reviews here !"
4,the mark,"game is pretty good but your partner should be able to die also to make the game more interesting,also it would have been better if you could medic your partner like you have to do yourself"
3,almost perfect,"This steel is just the right thing for honing blades right before using them (for more intensive sharpening use a stone). I only have a few objections:- I own two steels, one obtained two years ago that doesn't have the washer-shaped metal guard between the handle and the shaft, and one obtained four years ago that does. The one that does has collected a lot of scratches on the guard. I can't help but wonder if hitting that metal has also hurt my blades.- The wusthof logo is stamped onto the shaft, into the metal grooves, right where the tip of a blade passes. When honing a long blade I wind up holding the steel so that the blade doesn't hit the logo. (Those raised ridges can't possibly be good for the edge). But this means I only get to use half of the steel."
3,More appropriate for intermediate to advance readers,"For someone who is new to probability theories and statistics, you might consider something else more basic and introductory. I've had classes in probability and number theories in college. This book stumped me. It could be retitled: Cartoons for Statisticians. Definitely not a book for beginners as it may have been intended."
1,Authors don't like New Mexico,"I purchased this book before a recent visit to Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and Taos. I lived in Albuquerque for 4 years about 6 years ago, but I hoped to find new insigts on places to eat, explore, etc. Basically the guidebook told me where not to go. It failed to mention some excellent restaurants in Albuquerque including The Dog House, Las Mananitas, Il Vicino, etc. In Santa Fe I attended a class at the Santa Fe School of Cooking which was a five star class - not mentioned in the guidebook. In Taos I visited a community of alternative homes constructed of tires and cement (earthships.com will explain more) - again not mentioned in the book. I did go to look at a ruin near Espanola that was recommended, but the reservation does not allow admittance."
1,good riddance!!!,"see ya, racist! too bad you've always been a divider, not a healer. i guess the fact that your crummy propaganda books get published at all is really a testament to how wonderful america is."
4,"and understated ""wow"" factor.","I purchased this book because I felt that I could relate to the plight of the author. Sadly, I completely relate to his American experience from the perspective of a descendant of ""native-Africans-forced_into_American_slavery-American."" I understand his sarcasm, his disillusionment, his frustrations and his yearning for something more normal, natural and serene. I understand his statements ""Americans don‚Äôt know how to be equals."" And the American arrogance when he states ""Americans don‚Äôt bother to notice anybody else in the world."" There is so much more that I could write, but I wont. I'll just say this, reading this book is not for the faint of heart, the indoctrinated American dreamer or those that lead a socially and racially insular life style. I am truly pleased with this book and the writers perspectives."
3,Great Product But???,Minwax 30115 Formby's Lemon Oil TreatmentI just received this product delivered in a fair sized box. I had to laugh! I didn't read the amount I was ordering (my bad!). I guess when I saw it had a regular price over 50.00 and I got a great deal at just over 6.00 that I was ordering enough to last at least a couple years!! I opened the box and saw this average size bottle that sells for probably less than what I paid! Next time I will definately read the descriptions much closer and am a little disappointed with Amazon for inflating the prices of like items.
5,I love this show,"This is an awesome show, I loved watching it again. I just wish they would have made the 2nd season and put it on DVD. This show should be resurrected, it would easily beat any of the crap on network TV today."
3,Love it,"I loved this series when I was a kid and I love them still. The only thing that could of mad this, better is commentary."
5,Review of Space Above and Beyond,"For those who were fans of the show when it was originally aired, all I can say is that you won't be disappointed. This series is one of my all time favorite TV shows. When I discovered it was on dvd I snapped it up right away. The picture quality and sound is much better than the on air cable signal version I originally saw. This is the first TV series I have ordered on dvd and I was afraid the picture quality would be vhs. Boy was I wrong, this series looks as good as any hollywood movie dvd I have ever purchased. If you have never seen this series but liked the space marines in the second aliens movie then you will probably really like this series."
1,Wanted to like it,"I am a huge fan of sci-fi, love Firefly and was hoping to find something interesting like it. I was hugely dissapointed. I tried to overlook the wooden acting because some of the characters had potential, but the writing got worse and worse each episode. The dialog was unbelievably banal and predictable. And so were the storylines. After getting painfully through the ""River of Stars"" episode (on disk 3), I finally gave up. That one was the last straw for me. I really cannot recommend this series to anyone except perhaps to the fans of the movie Starship Troopers 3. I know they are out there....somewhere."
4,Space Above and Beyond - The (In)Complete Series,This series was great! It had so much potential. Such a shame they only made one season.
3,"Space, Not In it, On the Ground, and Beyond.","I don't mean to offend fans of the show, but the one thing that drove me crazy about this show is they were always on planets that looked just like earth. Some of the best glimpses of what this show could have been were just that... glimpses. It kind of reminds me of Wing Commander the movie (The games were better movies than the movie).Another Series that I love is the New Battlestar Galactica series, they have a nice blend of Ground, Space, Interaction of the Characters on the Ship. It blends well, and is very entertaining.I tried to Love Space Above and Beyond but in my opinion, there wasn't hardly any ""Space"" ""Above"" or ""Beyond"". Perhaps the show didn't satisfy my particular taste, or perhaps this is why it is no longer a show...If your a fan of this show however then I can not see how this is not the DVD package for you. But if your a fan of Battlestar Galactica then take it from me, this is not the same thing."
2,A gift for a friend,"I purchased this set as a gift for a friend. I knew that he was a big fan of the show when it originally aired, and thought that this would be a nice gift for him as he doesn't often indulge himself with DVDs and such.I had watched this show when it first aired, but remembered little of it. I wound up watching the first few episodes with him.Overall, it is alright. Nothing really stands out in this show, and all of the performances are b-rate at their best. I only suggest getting this if you already are a fan and want it all. Look to something else if you want to try something new"
5,S.A.A.B,"Very good dvds shame they were double sided dvd and only thin style cases. else very good. produced on a budjet for mass production, poss fan based dvds.well worth purchasing as you cannot get these elsewhere."
4,"Great series cut short, but poor DVD quality","I watched the first two DVD (first 4 episodes + the pilot) over the last week. I found several instances where the picture pixelated or the DVD just hung up and I had to restart by ejecting the disc and then selecting the episode where the error occurred. The storyline however is as satisfying as I remember. It is interesting look back on the production quality and special effects of just 6 years ago and see a huge difference between say the Ronald D. Moore BattleStar Galactica effects and this series. If you can ignore the production issues and realize that this is what the Hard Eight crew had to work with, it is still a well done gritty adventure with at decent backstory. I agree with the assesment that this is what Starship Troopers should have been, not the Paul Verhoeven comic-book movie it turned out to be."
5,definitely worth checking out,"There's a reason it's listed as being on of the greats - I caught most of it in syndication on the sci fi channel originally, and purchased this as a gift.i'm still wondering what would have happened in a second season."
3,A little dissapointed,"I only watched two episodes (okay one and a half) when this was on the air, I was pretty busy back then and taping shows for later viewing wasn't big on my list. The one full episode I watched I really liked so when I saw this out on DVD I decided to grab it.After watching a few episodes I have to say I'm a little dissapointed. It's a little more corny than I recall and the stories are rather thin plotwise. Not bad but definately not great."
2,Merely a diversion,"3 stars being average I give it a 2 star rating. First the product: no extras and my last disc was a bad disc, and you only have a limited time for returns so I lose. Examine your discs upon arrival. Second, this show is juvenile at best. The physics are bad, the visual effects are dated (bad even by those standards), the plots are trite, and the acting is okay with exceptions both ways. Of course everyone reviewing it complains about the lack of an ending, and though I agree it would be nice to know, it was cancelled because it was bad. If you must have it, turn off your brain and enjoy!"
4,This does the job,"I have had rotator cuff surgery and my physical therapist recommended a posture back brace. This product does the job and keeps my shoulder from turning inward, but I wish it was more comfortable."
