4,"3.5 STARS....GREAT ACTORS, MEDIOCRE STORY......","The most exciting things about this film are Michael Douglas and Susan Sarandon. Douglas stars as a former big city car salesman who was at the top of his game....until unscrupulous business practices put an end to it all. What remains is his seemingly insatiable appetite for very young women--no matter the cost. And the cost is high, as his appetite seems to have a negative effect on practically every aspect of his personal life and relationships; from that with his daughter and grandson, to his own girlfriend. And while a health scare may have exacerbated an already healthy appetite for the opposite sex, despite his bad behavior the protagonist is surrounded by a cast of people who have only his best interest in mind. A rather interesting tale, but not a movie I would rave over.-DYB"
2,"Great actor, bad story","As a huge fan of Michael Douglas' work, I had high expectations of this film. It's about a man and his relationship with the people closest to him and how they really are not that close at all. The acting was great due to an all star cast. However, the story failed to keep me interested and my mind often wandered."
2,dissapointing,"had good expectations for the movie, but the story is ultimately dismal. too much emphasis on a fascination with borderline statutory sex. there's some good dialogue here and there, but the overall story is unsympathetic, and a couple excuses for his rogue/childish behavior at the end add to the pathetic vibe of this film. a downer. michael and devito leave us cold again."
5,Honest and inspiring,"I picked this book after hearing about my friend who had her finance dump her part way into the trail. I guess his guilt about past indescretions were heavier than his pack.Usually I hate the style of alternating speakers, but they do it very well. I was glad that they were honest about their bickering (and even sited other authors on the subject) without being depressing. I felt it was honest, not sparing their dignity in describing the dangers of drinking un-filtered water. In was anxious to find out if they made it, and wanted to cheer them on through the rain of Washington (I live in southeast Alaska, so I know about hiking in the rain!).This is an honest, funny, sympathetic read. I loved it!"
3,Entertaining,"This book describes a couple's hike along the Pacific Coast Trail...quite an adventure! It doesn't go into great detail about the trail itself; rather, it focuses on the emotions they felt before, (mostly) during, and after the hike. While I enjoyed the book and its descriptions and stories - and marvel that anyone can pull of this kind of long-distance hike - I have to say I was put off by Duffy's apparently insensitivity to Angela throughout...who hikes ahead of their novice hiker girlfriend the whole way, for instance, just because they walk faster? It left a slightly sour taste while reading it, but overall, it was entertaining and easy to read."
1,This book should come with a warning.,"I bought this book hoping for a heart-warming tale of a man in his 40's adopting a child. But what I got was Ben Stein talking about how shallow he once was (he was right about that), and spouting his arch conservative views. While it's true that he does say what a great kid his boy Tommy is, neither his perspectives on parenting techniques (buy them whatever they want, whenever they want), nor his political diatribes (abortions are 'chopping up babies') were welcome. Unless you're intolerant, spiteful (Stein refers to one woman by name who was on the other side of him in a law suit as a 'witch'), and suffering from low self esteem (get a kid, they automatically think you're great if you're a dad!), don't get this book. And Amazon, please remove this book from the 'adoption' section, it's misleading."
1,Terrible!,"I am 6months pregnant and have done a little yoga in my time and this DVD is terrible! The poses hurt, they did not have good form and the instructor rambled the whole time. I turned it off half way through and left the workout feeling annoyed and sore(not in a good way)."
5,Mentally stimulating,I have played URU in the past and often desired the completed series. I really like solving the puzzles without having to fight off creatures to interrupt my line of thought. I believe that it is a great game to help keep those brain muscles exercised especially for those of us in our middle ages.
5,great timing!,this was here so much sooner than the quoted time! thanks for such great quality and speedy delivery! i didn't even pay for a rush!
1,very slow action,This is not a great purchase for an MMA fan. These fights feature at best 2nd rate fighters and the action is extremely slow. These fights are not like the ones currently held in sanctioned MMA. The referees cannot restart the action when it becomes slow and therefore you have a lot of wasted time with fighters just laying and praying. Also there are no rounds or time limits. This leaves the fighters with no sence of urgency to rush the fight or to create action. In fact one of the fights spends at least ten minutes with the fighters pressed against the cage jockeying for position with little progress either way.A fan of current MMA will be bored with the lack of action in these videos and someone looking to see the more primitive roots of MMA would be better suited purchasing the early UFC contests or the early events in pride. Those promotions feature a much higher caliber of fighters and also a little more action.
1,Too scientific,"I wanted a book that had more technical detail, but this book was so technical that I couldn't understand it and couldn't translate the information to something usable in the pool."
1,Nasty,This was the worst tasting stuff that I have ever eaten. It did not even taste like cheese. I would not waste my money on this product.
2,A little goes a long way...,I over bought. They arent bad... but the flavor is intense... to intense for me to eat more than a few at a time...
1,Waaaaay too salty.,Just way too salty. That's all. They could be really good but lack of proper reasoning and tasting made the producers of this product incorrectly believe that it was palatable. So salty you can't enjoy them.
1,taste burnt,I have had parmeson crisps before and thought these would be similar.They tasted burnt and were hard to swallow even after thourough chewing. Not tasty at all.
1,YUCK!!!,I would give this Zero Stars if possible. Absoutely terrible. I wish there had been reviews when I ordered. I was hoping for a good crunchy low carb snack. These did not fill the bill. Anyone interested in the 5 unopened bags?
4,Birthday Gift,"M boyfriend gave me this a my birthday gift. I was wanted a camcorder since i like making movies and videos and i use to use the long time ago video camera. I LOVE the fact that the camera is small and easier to handle, that its not heavy and does not act as excess baggage. The only thing i dont like about it is that the battery last for less than 4 hours. I enjoy recordering and catching the moments of simple nonsence but most times i cant because when we are in the middle of having fun or something exciting is happening thats when the battery goes died but apart from that i love this camcorder."
3,Smells good but doesn't shine as much as I'd hoped,"I love how this smells but it didn't really do anything to detangle or create a lot of shine. I have Thick, fine, very straight hair that will tangle easily. I continued to use other non-organic products that have more slip to them (It's a 10, Giovanni organic hair serum, anything that contains methicones/dimethicones) even though they can be more damaging. It helped for flyaways after I had blowdried my hair, and again, the smell was great, but I won't make this a main product that I use."
4,"Great Stuff, Don't Use Too Much","I love the smell and the detangling it does for my long hair, but the size is way too small for someone with a lot of hair to detangle. I found if you use too much it attracts dust like a magnet."
5,Hip Hop at it's BEST,"This CD brings life back into Hip Hop. It's real and raw. It brings me back to the days when Hip Hop was exciting and fresh. Black Ice is Hip Hop at it's BEST. What I thought was lost in booty shaken songs and 1, 2, step'n songs was found again in this CD!! Thank you Black Ice for being real to the GAME!!"
4,All in one place,"Dvd's came in excellent condition. Love the idea of so many good movies of same genre in a smaller space - my dvd library is getting crowded. Easy to order, easy to pay, good price. Will be ordering similar products in the future.One-stop girl's night in. Got to be good!"
2,BORED TO TEARS,This is another of a half dozen or so poorly acted poorly scripted La Llorona film about the legend of the demon that causes women to drown their own children. The production couldn't hold my interest 3 minutes into the film. They used typical horror piano music and what was that fakey looking red-eye make-up? Horror fans will be bored to tears.
1,"Well, It Had Creepy Music...","and it had a creepy premise, but that was about it. I wanted this movie to be more than it was (um, I guess I want that of most things I watch), something along the line of Japanese Scary Atmospheric Horror, but it fell flat and never got better. It failed on almost all levels, but the music was truly haunting and got under my skin - I just wish the movie tried as hard. The filmmakers will luck out a bit on this one since people will look at the cover and give it a chance, albeit an undeserved one."
2,Lost Potential..,"""The Cry"" has an interesting story, a 500 year old legend about a child-killing demon, but the director does nothing to draw in the viewer. This film is boring, boring, boring. The cinematography is grainy and the story is told in the same murky manner.There are better horror movies out there."
1,La Malinche,"Wow seriously? This movie had terrible cinematics. I disliked everything about it. I could have edited it better with my crap computer. The acting was okay. But they didnt explain the story well at all. Could have been alot better. I would not have understood much if I hadnt read about this story before. The ending was stupid as hell as well. ""Your next"" how original. My god who ever wrote the script should be drowned as well."
5,High Quality Printing,"The piano and vocals are clearly printed which makes for a good quality score. Chords for each harmony are printed in the vocal sections but not in the introductary measures. Difficulty of music depends on the particular song for example, ""Somewhere"" and ""One Hand, One Heart"" are easier. I've enjoyed playing this music and would recommend it."
3,The Greatest,"Cy young won more games than any other pitcher ever has, or ever will. The award for best pitcher in each league is named for him. This is the story of his life and career.To love the sport of baseball is to love history. The players' performances always are being compared to their own previous years and to other players', even from a century ago. Reading about these early Hall of Fame players provides information about how the game was played decades ago, and how it has changed.The author of this book is adulatory, as is to be expected. This is information without a lot of analysis, but well worth the read."
2,Disappointed,"Having listened to a few of Katatonia's albums, this one came as a big disappointment. It is so unfinished, so ""clever-highschool-band-like"". Bought it because of the dark sound, after listening to some pieces on Amazon. On the other side, the guitars sound good, and the sound of the vocal is ok, so I listen to it smiling, but this comes from the thought that Katatonia like many great bands have had a start that might not be too convincing.(It is reaching for a three star rate..) You hear the base they are building for the years to come. For the hard-core fans, go get it, to get the total picture of this great band. You others, stay away. The catalogue contains much better stuff."
2,way too mature for young girls!,"I wanted to send a gift to a 12 yr. old girl to mark the beginning of menstruation and I choose this book after reading several reviews. I was horrified when her parents called to tell me about some of the testimonies from the later chapters. Everthing from rape, to 3-way sex, to teenage prostitution is discussed vividly. This book is intended for a much older audience, particularly survivirs of abuse."
5,Great Phone!!!,This is the monochrome display expansion handset for the SD7561 or SD7581 phone system. I own the SD7581 and one of these additional handsets.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this phone!!!It has EXCELLENT quality and ergonomics!!!
2,Get the SD-7502 if you can find it,"I like the SD-7502 handset much better than this one. The screen is similar to that of a cell phone. However, they are nearly impossible to find. Also, you need to buy a decent battery for longer life. The ""sanik"" are no good. I'm told that the Energizer ER-P510 will last a lot longer and cost more of course.Even with new Energizer battery, phone goes out after an hour. I doesn't give you any warning either. It beeps and bye bye."
2,Battery Drains within 1 Hour,"If your call lasts more than 1 hour, don't buy this phone system.I've used these phones for corporate teleconferencing. I have to keep 2nd handset next to me for backup. Usually low battery warning cuts off the line, and it goes away no matter how soon I turn on the 2nd. So, lots of embarrassing moments. Using 2.5mm headset doesn't help much to extend battery, instead of speaker phone. Changing battery doesn't help much neither. In less than 3 years of $100 investment, I'm looking for other & more reliable phone system with longer talk time."
1,Not worth the money!,"I recieved this product today. It is a plastic resin material that is flimsy and poor quality. It has plastic nuts with a plastic wrench for assembly. I would not feel comfortable letting my children sit on it for fear that they would tip over. If anything it is good for pure looks and that is all, but not for actually sitiing on! You might break it! If it wasn't such a pain to take apart I would return it!"
1,Disappointing remixes.,"I fell in love with the song the moment I heard it. When I saw this maxi single for sale, I was overjoyed. When I actually played the CD, I was horrified.The mixers turned a sultry, hip swaying song into a spastic catastrophe. What's worse - they didn't even include the regular radio single version on this CD. If you love this song - the way you've heard it - do yourself a favor and buy the REGULAR CD single."
2,Wrong Edition,"I thought I was ordering the third edition of this book, because thats what I needed for class, but I was sent a second edition. Luckily, my class isn't centered around the book, but that's a pretty major mistake to make."
3,nothing special,"This was just ok - nothing special. Some subtitles.Two rich Mexican girls lose their mother and later their father. When the father dies they find out they have an older brother from a different mother, and that their father was in bankruptcy. The girls have lost their parents, their home and their wealthy lifestyle.Their aunt took them in, to a house already full of people and what was at first a very scary neighborhood environment. With time they learned to adapt and eventually embrace their heritage and find love in the process. And they eventually gain a relationship with their new brother."
3,solid 3 star movie,"I wasn't expecting much out of this movie; but despite the predictable plot, I enjoyed the movie! it was entertaining and I liked that the scenes were really shot in East LA. Camila Belle and Alexa Vega complement each other perfectly as sisters."
4,I really liked this movie a lot.,"A nice pleasant and fun movie good acting aid inferno twist on a classic script, Wilmer Valderrama did a great job."
4,Formulaic But Better Than I Expected,"A good movie for families with teens. Not totally squeaky clean but not too embarrassing to watch with your parents.I had no idea it was supposed to be based on Sense and Sensibility and frankly I haven't read it. When I read the movie blurb I immediately thought, another variation of Material Girls and expected it to be pretty lame, like, are we really ready for a remake of that already?But, I enjoyed watching From Prada to Nada with my teenage daughter. I thought it was better done than Material Girls although they have almost the same plot. It kept us wondering a little bit, which guy was gonna get which girl.Just good, basic entertainment, better than most TV. I liked the soundtrack. Having some of the characters speak Spanish with subtitles added to the presentation."
4,Not Ashamed to Say I Like It,"When I found out this movie was to Sense and Sensibility as Clueless was to Emma I realized I needed to see it. Like the novel, I found the A plot, Nora and Edward, to be a bit dull, while the B plot, Mary and Bruno (Marianne and Brandon) to be endearing and sigh worthy. Alexa Vega does a really nice job as Mary...whoever plays Nora is terrible. While this movie is not as good as Clueless, I also don't think Sense and Sensibility is as good as Emma, yet both are worth reading just as this movie is more than worth watching. The modernization is cleverly done making this movie fun to watch if for no other reason than seeing how they translated parts of the book into a modern setting."
4,Very enjoyable,My wife and I really enjoyed the movie! It was a very good choice for a date night dinner and a movie without the kids!
4,Review,"I think the movie was adorable and enjoyed watching it. I liked that both sisters have different problems, but learn from their mistakes."
4,Good positive videos for young children,I have very sensitive grandchildren and they don't like the violence or dark side in many of the children's videos - so these are great positive videos.
5,The under-rated pioneer of the genre gets better and better!,"Stuck Mojo (www.stuckmojo.net), one of the earliest poineers of the ""rap/metal"" genre, is also the most uncredited, under-rated and best of the bunch. Mojo is probably the only band that has actually created a successful, seamless blending of the varying musical styles that are rap/hiphop/heavy metal. Rich Ward (www.thedukerocks.com) is also one of the best heavy guitarists (and very influential according to interviews with current guitar stars). Ward has a knack for creating very heavy, crushing yet melodic sounds that get in your head and you just can't stop listening to the songs. The music sounds genuinely unique, original, and authentically Mojo. You know Ward's sound whether you hear it in Mojo or his other band Fozzy. This band and musical effort will remain a timeless classic for the decades to come. I never cease to be amazed by the virtuosity and quality of this music and love love love it!!!"
4,Great hard rock,"As a wrestling fan I first saw the video for ""Rising"" on a certain monday night program. Since then I have enjoyed the thunderous sound of ""Stuck Mojo"". They have what it takes to be a very successful band in today's underground hard rock world. The music is very fast and powerful with enough longevity to keep you listening for months!"
4,Review,"some very useful hints for older child when bringing baby home. most of it is common sense, but there are some good ideas i am using. Some of the anecdotes are comical.Note, the content is almost identical to ""And Baby Makes Four""."
1,"Overlong and tiresome, weak script, but visually interesting","I didn't think this film was that funny when I first saw it in 1966 at the age of 10, and after seeing it again nearly 40 years later my opinion hasn't changed.What is interesting are scenes of now largely-vanished Tokyo in the mid-1960s (note that the Okura Hotel, though, hasn't changed at all!). Exaggerated scenes of bowing, the apparent disgust of eating raw octopus, etc, are nowadays really not amusing.The film is pervaded by that tiresome style of American acting where the characters more or less yell at each other in a bad-tempered way (for instance when they can't get the coffee pot to work), this being construed as 'comedy.'"
4,One of my favorite Grant vehicles,This film is a delight. It holds up well with Cary Grant's other romantic comedies. I particularly enjoy all the side action happening around Grant.
1,Bratz SUCK! MY SCENE RULES WITH A CAPITAL R!!!!!!!,"THESE DOLLS SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THEY ARE FOR HOOCHIE,GROSS,DIRTY GIRLS!!"
3,sOmE dOLLs.....,My sister loves Bratz dolls soooo much that i knew i had to get these for her on her b.day. She was so happy when she tore out the wrapper. They were her first Bratz dolls as my mom did not allow her to buy any toys cuz they contain small parts.(She's only four now)we had so much fun mixing 'n' matching fashions. I love the Roxxi doll! She's simply beautiful. I was liking Bratz and thought that their quality is good so maybe i decided to buy one for myself too. Yeah....you Bratz fans might be feelin proud that someone likes bratz too.....all i can say is DREAM ON!! My sister wanted to switch Roxxi's shoes for Phoebe's but the stub from Roxxi's legs got stuck to the feet and my sister was so sad that she cried. I still think My Scene is sooo much better than those dopey Bratz. they look like sluts.
1,Freaks,I don't like Bratz. I think that they are just snap on foot dolls with big heads and big lips. There is nothing apealing about them. That explains the person who suggested to burn them if you get them. There is not one thing i like about them. They have terrible clothes and i don't recomend them for any age.
4,stop writing bad reviews,people should stop writing ba d reviews about bratz and myscene and barbie. i like myscene and bratz so deal with it. keep your ideas to yourself i have like three myscene dolls.i have like 29 bratz dolls and will have 31 because im getting the tess and nona twins.because i have the other twins.so stop writing bad reviews ok
2,Freuds lamest book,"Freud speculated two Moses: an Egyptian nobleman who lived near the time of the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaton, the founder of the world's first monotheism, who gave the Hebrews a modified version of that religion and was killed by them as a result; and a Midianite who resurrected this religion, modified it still further, and coupled it with the Egyptian rite of circumcision, thereby setting the Hebrews apart as a chosen people.Sounds weird, doesn't it? It is.Freud has an uncanny habit of failing to interpret the symbolism of his own theoretical work. The split Moses, based on the primal father (see Totem and Taboo) killed and eaten by rebellious sons: what more accurate picture could the reader want of the fate of Freud's Wednesday Psychological Society and its rebellious offspring?Stylistically, however, Freud reads a bit like Conan Doyle, and the interest he creates with his detective-story reasoning is matched only by his immense lucidity and command of the written word."
3,Great Phone - Horrible Battery Life,"We bought this phone to view the coordinating camera with, picture, call quality, ease of use is FANTASTIC ! ! !Would highly recommend phone for it's innovation and features. The ability to view from the coordinating camera has been fantastic and we use this often as our baby/child monitor. BIG DRAWBACK the battery life is absolutely AWEFUL ! ! ! We try to leave the phones on the charger and can rarely hold more than a couple minute conversation on the phone before the battery dies, so far I have yet to find a better battery to replace then one that came with it. Have had these phones for >1yr."
4,Nice and Refreshing,I was ambivalent about purchasing cologne online but I took a chance and went with all the existing reviews and it worked out well.
3,Common sense,"This book is basically common sense. I was hoping to gain some kind of hidden insight, but it's basically what they tell you in school; don't read to edit, read and make comments."
4,"I dig the Sylvers.....check out ""Handle It"".....","If you never heard the track ""Handle It"" from the LP ""Sylvers II"" then you need to check it out...this track smokes!!! Too funky. I have a vinyl copy but would love to this on CD.......peace."
3,Disco Fever!,"If you love 70s disco, you'll love The Sylvers. Hot Line, Boogie Fever, Cotton Candy just to name a few. No self-respecting disco connoisseur would miss adding this CD to their collection."
4,Better Than Expected.,"I wasn't for sure what to expect from DARKNESS FALLS, but after watching it, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie is one of the best thrillers I have seen in a long time. It contains several unexpected ""jumpers"" (events that make you jump) and has a decent plot. There isn't much gore, but there are a lot of people who end up killed. There is no sex and very little foul language. The best way I can describe the movie is that it seemed like a cross between a Hitchcock thriller and PITCH BLACK. The film does have a few flaws, but if you watch the movie without any expectations, it will surprise you. Not a movie for those who like a lot of splatter and gore, but it is something that those with tamer tastes will probably enjoy."
2,Unoriginal and uninspired ...,"Some genuinely tense moments are scattered though an otherwise run-of-the-mill horror movie.Still though, it's not all bad. It's adequately acted. Don't get me wrong, nobody's winning any awards, but I wouldn't say anyone phoned it in. As I stated earlier, there are a couple moments that'll make you jump.The real benefit though, is that it's rated PG-13. A studio finally saw an advantage to cutting out some of the gore and language, thus widening their audience to include a young crowd.I know that most horror fans aren't going to give this film the time of day; but any parents out there that need a rental for a sleepover should give this an extra look. If the kids want a scary movie for the night, they may be able to rest a little easier grabbing a movie that still fits the bill but has a lighter rating."
2,what a waste of what could have been great.,"dumb, dumb, dumb, can describe this film . it's great at first but loses steam very fast first 20 mins of the picture & the rules they made they broke which bugged me alot it was scary then it was joke avoid this at all cost , but if you want a heckle then rent it. PG-13 in tense situations & profanity . not for little kids i'm warning you."
5,A Toothless Nightmare,"Never listen to reviewers and/or critics when trying to decide on a movie, or anything else for that matter. ""Darkness Falls"" is a creepy and suspenseful horror movie that shines like a polished trophy. People who like horror films will not be dissapointed in this one. I liked every scene in the movie, from beginning to end. What is frightening about The Tooth Fairy is that you don't see her face until the end, which is genius on the part of director Jonathan Liebesman. From lighting, to acting, to director of photography, to storyline, to creature design and creation, this movie exceeds excellence and should be watched with the lights on ..."
1,The unscariest film ever,"The un-scariest movie I have ever seen! It's about the tooth fairy! It's a bad movie about a stupid story involving the tooth fairy. Seriously, who is afraid of the tooth fairy?!! This is worse than ""Boogeyman""."
1,I AM AMAZED!!!!!!,"Truly, some one had to have really dedicated themselves to every inch of film shot in this movie too maximze its raw potential too suck with out even a hint of remorse.... Color me impresssed!"
1,Terrible,"Had a promising opening then just got worse and worse. but c'mon seriously who are we kidding anyway. A killer tooth fairy give me a break Hollywood was really reaching on this stupid as* blunder. To make a long story short this movie sucks, im glad a buddy of mine got it for me because if i went to the theaters or bought it on DVD somebody would have gotten a serious as* kickin"
3,Decent for an old movie...,"Let's face it. Old scary movies have awful effects. The idea of the plot is good, but I wouldn't say it was carried out very well. I was entertained, but I wouldn't spend more than like $4 on it including shipping."
1,DARKNESS SMELLS REALLY BAD!!!!,This film is the worst horror film in the last ten years. Even worse than the remake of THE HAUNTING...this absolute drivel fails on every single level. Except for the special effects which are very good. So you have a truly appalling film with cool monster effects. Remarkably banal characters that you just can't care about. The only effective part of this film is the first fifteen minutes and from then on it's a complete failure.The ghost suddenly fails to be affected by the light that is supposed to kill it or keep it at bay. DREADFUL does not begin to describe the incredible charmlessness of this sad piece of horse manure. The only good thing about it is that it made money at the box office. So at least someone got paid. I should be paid back for ever having to watch this piece of dreck in the first place.
2,A lame attempt!,"Despite a fascinating story, Darkness Falls never reaches its full potential. Things go downhill after a fantastic (and very scary) opening. Plot is sacrificed for cheap deaths and scares that just don't work, making what could have been terrific psychological horror cheesy, sappy, and boring. The legend of the tooth fairy should have been explored a bit more and the psychological tension of the opening should have remained throughout, rather than the awful death scenes being the film's only redeeming quality. When we finally get to see Matilda Dixon (the tooth fairy), it is disappointing. She was better left invisible because her appearence makes an already terrible film even worse (and I would omit that annoying laugh of hers from the soundtrack every time she's around)--UGH! The wonderful Emma Caufield is purely wasted. This ultimately fails after such a promising start. There is no imagination in its script or direction. The very similar THEY is SLIGHTLY better."
3,Worth the rental fee but not retail. 3 Starts,"This not scary in the same way that a horror flick like Hellraiser or the 1st Evil Dead is. If they had not made the tooth fairy into some kind of demonic creature from hell, and stuck to the Matilda Dixon story in bonus section, this would have been a lot more freaky in my opinion.Worth the rental fee but not the retail price.3 STAR RATING FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF HORROR DVD's."
2,Darkness Falls,"Tedious, stupid and idiotic tale of a man who goes back to his hometown to rescue his childhood sweetheart and her son from a spirit who killed his mother when he was a boy. Although it starts out extremely scary, this turns into one of the worst horror films ever made. The dialogue is crap - at one point, a woman actually says: ""let me get this piece of gravel out of your scalp."" There is another situation where the same woman is startled by a black cat who jumps over her car and she says: ""a black cat...why not?"" The villain is often very creepy, but gets rather annoying with her hissing noises heard when she appears. The script is lacking in any sort of realism, and the direction takes ideas from more successful and effective films like ""The Ring."" It isn't a complete waste of time, because it does deliver a few scares (it's more of a teenager-Halloween-party-film). But I'd refrain from buying it on all accounts."
1,Gimme a break - this horrible movie reeked of cliches,"How can anybody say this was a good movie?! The plot was weak, full of holes, cliches and the evil spirit was more of a laughable joke. I was expecting the evil character to cross her arms and start breakdancing to the music as the credits roll because that's how comical I found this pathetic movie to be. Every cliche is there. The puffy-eyed, pale-faced 8 year old boy who sees dead people, the stupid slew of characters that happen to find their way in the path of the evil spirit and the weakest main male character I've ever saw. No man in the real world would let an evil spirt or monster attack his mother and not defend her. The main male character in the movie was a punk all the way to the end of the movie."
2,Vastly overrated ghost story,"I eagerly watched ""Darkness Falls"" after reading a recommendation that it's even better than ""The Ring"". Sorry. No cigar. Granted, it's better than most of the dreck coming out of Hollywood that's supposed to pass for horror. But that's not saying much. The creators of ""DF"" seemed to say ""let's take the best elements from the last two successful scarey flicks and combine them into one movie"". Since ""The Blair Witch Ring"" would've been too obvious, I guess they settled on ""Darkness Falls"". Okay, I'm a jaded, middle aged horror film connoisseur, sure, but even my seventeen year old thought it was a big disappointment."
2,Darkness Palls,"Maybe this was a good flick. I couldn't tell because on my new Panasonic 27 inch TV set, the images were so DARK I could see nothing. Second after second passed by and I heard noises but saw no images. And then towards the end, the images began to actually lighten up some. A word of wisdom to future movie makers: when you transfer a very darkly lit and photographed movie to DVD, please LIGHTEN it up some visually! The same nightmare happened when I brought ""The Relic,"" a movie I loved in the theater. As a DVD, it proved worthless. I could see literally nothing for long minutes."
1,Horrible,I mean c'mon this movie is bull s*** worst movie ive ever seen not even scary if u were a horror movie fan like me you would agree. it sucks on the movie review it got a D- it suck ok totally horrible
2,"""Grab me the bottle of Vivarin. Hurry...before I...zzzzz...""","Moonspell's stylistic changes have been a bit too drastic for me from album to album. I loved their first mCD, Wolfheart, and like Irreligious. They seemed to lose their raw edge too quickly, and some of their passion dissipated with it. The previous albums were enjoyable, but I can't say the same for this.On this new album, they've mellowed out so much that I'm not sure they're even alive any more. The vocals are painfully monotone and flat. It looks like they're trying for a subtle gothic dance-club theme while using the metal guitars to maintain their status in that genre as well. It doesn't work. I don't know if goth finds will like this, but I doubt many metal fans will. The use of strange percussion emphasizes their new direction, but it sounds like a bunch of pots and pans banging around in the back of a truck. I don't know why they did it, but it's all through the album, and wears thin as the counter reaches the 60th minute."
5,A thrash essential...,"I consider this one of those 80's/90's thrash cds that are a must-have for any collection. I love it! I don't own Socialized Hate yet, but according to other reviews, this is the better of the two cds that Atrophy released. It's quite a gem, and the good thing..... you can still get it at a reasonable price (unlike bands like Exumer, Dark Angel, & Mandator). The entire album has a great fast tempo. The favorite for most is the track ""Puppies and Friends,"" but like I said.... it's an all around solid album. Worth picking up for under $15."
5,great absorbent towel,"These are soo nice; thin, crisp, absorbent and a perfect size for a hair towel which is what I wanted them for."
3,"Brian Eno has brains, talent, and all God's blessings.","This is a fascinating account of the day to day life of one of music's truest free-thinkers. I was absorbed and at the same time felt sick. I wonder if anyone realizes how life's continued good fortune allows the space for this free-thinking? Or how opportunity begets opportunity? If the reader thinks beyond the surface of Eno's daily account, he'll see that the real story here is how life in the ""arts"" really works."
1,Unreliable Seller,"I ordered this phone on Jan 15, 2004. Today is Feb 9, 2004 and I have not received it to date. I've tried contacting the seller, but the emails are bounced back and it states the email address is not valid. Everyone, I urge you NOT to purchase from this seller."
5,Yummy!!!,This is one of my favorite things---Even fresh garlic won't get you this beautiful intense flavor. I panicked when my local markets didn't have it recently. Now I'm happy I was able to order it here!
3,Refined sugars are worse than fat,"Yes, refined sugars (often labled carbohydrates) are stored as fat faster than fat is stored as fat. You reduce refined sugar of course you'll lose weight. When you see 29g of carbohydrates on a juice label think of it as 29g of fat -that's what it really is man-made fat disquised as sugar. Now. Look longgg term. Your arteries will be so clogged in 20 years you won't believe it. True carbohydrates (not man-made) will give you energy without un-felt effects of arterial clogging. This could be a good book to straighten out eating habits, (dropping all the garbge snacks we eat and drink) but I wouldn't recommend it long term (more than 6 months) to anyone."
3,Old Atkin's Diet Book,I intentionally purchased this older copy of the Atkin's Diet book because it has recipes in it that are not available in the newest versions. It looks used! but serves the purpose for which I bought it.
2,The book was informational but the diet isn't working.,"My husband and I started this diet after hearing so many stories. Our goal is to drop 15-20 pounds. We have only been on the diet for 4 days but we have never felt worse. The diet claims to give you energy but if you already take vitamins, there won't be any new found energy. We are exhausted and I have had a headache for four straight days. I am concerned that the Adkins Center won't answer questions when you call. My advise - be careful!!"
3,Lower Cholesterol & Triglycerides!,"I had bloodwork done before starting the diet. In 3 months, my cholesterol went from 208 to 145 and my Triglycerides dropped from a dangerous 670 to 204. My appetite decreased, I had lost 20 pounds and had more energy! Now after another 3 months, my triglycerides are in the normal range. This happened while I ate all the protein I wanted, up to 90 grams of fat per day and lots of vegetables.People think you continue to eat that way forever. If you read the book, you find that you gradually move back into a more liberal diet that meets your own needs. As I added back the fruit and milk, I ate less fat and now am on a healthy well-balanced diet. My weight has stayed off and I expect to continue maintaining by eating sensibly."
3,Great Results...But be careful!,"Dr. Atkins suggestions for lowering one's amout of carbohydrate intake per day is a great idea, and it worked for me! There is always a hitch to everything remember, and be careful not to use this diet for any great length of time. The human body does not like to be deprived of anything for extended periods of time, and so I found that the best way to use this diet was for a jump start to healthy living. After two weeks of dieting I lost about 10 lbs, and then became more aware of the nutritional contents in the food I was eating. From this knowledge I am now able to better balance my meals, but I do eat breads and carbohydrates now, just in moderation! The book is a worthwhile read."
2,Disapointed,"I was disappointed but don't blame the author. I should have realized that reading something originally published about 20 years ago, would be vastly different from the New Atkins Diet.Also, I haven't read a paperback in over 25 years, so that was hard as well (the typeface)."
5,The Bible on LC,"Dr. A has been proven right time and time again, people called him crazy when he first suggested that carbohydrates caused weight (fat) gain and now decades later the science proves him correct over and over again.This book is amazing in its clarity and purpose, to help us lose weight and eat healthy.It's hard at first to give up all those yummy carbs but it is so worth it if you want to be healthy and thin. This diet will make you healthier than you have been in years.Fat phobia has caused the obesity epidemic, there is NO reason to cut real fat (not processed fats that are bad for you) in your diet, it is good for you and does not cause you to be fat, fat is the bodies way of storing excess carbs, so eat less carbs and your body doesn't need to store any excess, it's pretty simple."
5,The Shephard of the hills,A very inspirational book. Helps me to understand what is real in this world. My father-in-law recommended we read it. He grew up in the Ozarks. It sheds some light on life back in that day.
5,Zizi's masterpiece,"In my opinion, Zizi Possi is one of the finest voices of contemporary Brazilian music. Her high-pitched, moody vocals are always compelling. This 1991 recording represented a shift in her career: that's when she decided to leave her usual label to be able to sing what she really wanted and the way she wanted, with much more restrained arrangements than before: here just piano, cello, charango and percussion. And the result is really great, since Zizi's voice is so melodic that it doesn't need much orchestration. The repertoire ranges between heartfelt ballads and more raucous rhythms. Some of the best cuts are the exquisite cover of Chico Buarque's ""Eu te amo"" and her very personal version of ""Com que roupa"", a Brazilian classic from the 20s."
4,mary had a litle lamb,the book was very colorful i loved the pictures easy for children to connect. i love sally mavor's work she is an excellent artist. i will continue to buy her books. and the shipment time was great
2,Don't buy it!,"Okay, like many I have been looking for the full 2 hour version of this film. I thought I found it here since the description clearly states 120 minutes as a run time. Well, I got the video and it's 90 minutes like most of the rest. The film at 90 minutes is okay but butchered. If you're looking for the full 120 minute dvd as I was, pass this by because it isn't it. I don't care what the description says!"
2,"Great film, poor quality","The film is great and packed with adventures but the visual and sound quality leaves much to be desired. This particular DVD was not digitally remastered. It seems that they just copied it from a very very very old VHS tape to a DVD, which does spoil the enjoyment of watching Alain Delon in this adventure. Let's hope that one day this flim will be re-released in the format and quality it deserves."
1,if your looking for a lift dont order this!!!!!!!,"In the product discription its says it is a 6"" lift kit and list all the parts that are included in the kit. But all you recive is the radius arms and still have to buy another 1000$ in parts to complete the lift. Also can't get ahold of amazon witch is the seller to find out why the rest of the parts they say are included are not. Do not buy this kit if your looking for a full kit."
4,Healing Cancer,Ultimately the individual with a diagnosis of cancer has to make his or her own choice of therapy based on informed knowledge. The DVD is educational in that it reminds us that there are always alternatives to mainstream allopathic medicine which always comes with side effects and which need not necessarily suit everybody.
5,great quality,"This tablecloth is great. Its water-repellent, doesn't wrinkle or snag, and hasn't faded with washing. The color is rich and vibrant. Very pleased with it and will probably get in in several other colors."
3,It was okay,I didn't actually know who they were until my friends had told me about them. I think the DVD was okay in just explaining what they are all about. It's definetley not something for 15 and under.
4,Using The Math Dictionary,My part-time retirement job is academically coaching and tutoring children. This resource will be dog-eared soon. More than 2 or 3 times a week it has enabled me to better serve my students. It has met my expectations and then some.
5,OH MI GOSH,"Oh goodness. I love the Dragonrider of Pern series, but this was one of the best. One thing bugged me though, I HATED the sad ending, ans I hate sad books. But other than that, i am fine, in fact, I LOVE IT!"
4,Great story!,"So, *this* is the ledgendary Moreta? Great book. Several people have criticized it on Moreta's use of timing it, however, I got the impression that timing it was merely forgotten during the Long Interval, or perhaps earlier. Given its strain on riders, it's not unreasonable that it might be banned. However, there is a HUGE plothole that keeps me from giving it 5 stars - WHY didn't they merely go between to BEFORE the plague and prevent it from happening in the first place? They could've prevented that ship from going to the Southern Continent, or had it quaranteened. Ms. McCaffrey seems to want to avoid timing it to change history, but why shouldn't it? The timeline of _Dragonflight_ must, logically, be such a changed timeline"
4,A nice fill-in for the Pern series,"I like this story but it doesn't capture my attention the way some of the other Pern stories do. It does fill in some important info for Pern devotees and that, alone, would be worth it.The focus is not so much on the dragons of Pern but on the people and how they deal with the unexpected disaster of an epidemic."
3,My least favorite Pern Book,"Well written, but could have done without some of the sexual behavior of the riders filler."
3,Does not cover all that it could.,Example contracts are limited in scope. They are for accountants doing audits and engineers doing design and as a result are difficult to generalize on. Does not cover international contract and fee problems. Sections on generating exposure and finding a niche are well written but off of the topic.
4,Love it For the Grown and Sexy,"Love this lounge music real mello can dance, chat, play games while enjoying it .. its lovely"
4,Down With The 5-Hand Gang,"I decided to purchase this based on a previous review. When I received the disc, I thought I was in for a low-budget waste o' ten bucks. (I rounded off). I must say that I enjoyed this movie immensely. As a major fan of old-school kung fu flicks, this one ranks up at the top. Specifically because it's consistently good from start to finish. In most martial arts movies of the late 70's, they start off dreadfully, in both humor and choreography, then get better as they go. The humor is kept to a minimum and the fights are consistently good and inventive.The picture quality is very good. It does suffer if you compare it to remastered Shaw Bros. movies. If you like the old-school, I can't imagine that you won't enjoy this. The price is excellent. My only complaint with this one is that it is not in widescreen, though i don't recall it being a big deal while viewing.1979. aka: 7 Steps of Kung Fu"
3,PED - Basic,"I bought a Brother Innovis 1000, cannot use embroidery designs that is not already loaded on the machine... without this PED Basic. I think this should be sold with the machine, kinda like buying a sterio without speakers.You can't add designs straight to the card without the program and the adapter."
3,Its a great product but I now have to buy they up cd so i can created my own designs.,Awesom Product but on they other they really need to up the cds so that you can created your own designs rather than keep spend more money i find disapointing that i now have to find the up to 8.03 verson cds.
1,Terrible experience,Didn't got what I ordered. Cannot rate because they sent a cheep substitution which is not acceptable. No response to efforts to contact seller. They do not answer e-mail
4,It is a Brother embroidery memory card writer and reader.,It does what it says. It is not a full designer software just a card reader-writer for Brother embroidery cards and this is exactly what I wanted.Very happy with it.
4,"Basic, easy way to transfer embroidery files","Not much to say about this... just that it works well for transferring embroidery files from your computer to the data card. Easy to use, basic program. Lets you do minor resizing of files, and you can look at a preview of what the design will look like once stitched.I just wish that you could do more with this program, as far as minor edits, especially for the high cost... but I have another program for that now.If you have Windows Vista, go to the Brother website to download a different driver for the card reader - don't use the included disc."
3,Brother PED-basic Software,This software works well on my old computer with windows 98 but does not work with my lap top which has Windows Visa. I tried the patches and could not get them to work. I am suprised Brother is selling something so outdated.
3,good embroidery software,"great product. was exactly as advertised. it was easy to install and use even for someone with limited computer skills.i still need more time to work with the memory card in the machine, but so far like it very well"
1,Review of embroidery software,This software may work fine on a pc. We have a Mac and it is unusable.
2,Not what I expected,"I thought I would be able to create my own designs but the software this came with does not allow that. I think I would have to have version 8 to create (not entirely sure) but this one came with version 1 (can only DOWNLOAD pre-made designs from the Brother website). The device itself was handy but the embroidering choices the software came with were nothing really interesting for my taste and the website wasn't much better (all flowery and ""lovey Dovey"" with a few cheesy holiday designs). I don't know why brother just doesn't designing their sewing machines to read SD cards instead of their own proprietary cards. That would save a lot more money and make things easier and convenient... I actually regret purchasing this bundle with the version 1 software but I don't regret the reader. I suggest looking for a reader that includes version 8 software or any version that actually ALLOWS you to create your own design."
2,don't get!,"I shopped around, did get it cheaper here. still payed to much for it. doesn't work with my machine. not easy to use."
3,"Brother PED Embroidery Software, ordered thru Amazon","The best I can say about this product is that it was offered at a good price.First off, it does work, and I have been able to use it with my Brother embroidery machine. However.....it says it works with Windows 7, but I and many, many others have had trouble making all the functions work properly after installing it. The program opens, but doesn't allow the important function of accessing embroidery designs in my computer files. I went thru Brother customer service, many blogs, chatrooms, websites, etc. looking for a technical solution, and nothing worked on my computer. So, I ended up going the back door route; in Windows Explorer, I transferred designs from my files to the only file the Brother PED recognizes, it's own Samples folder. Inconvenient, but at least it works."
4,It's just as it says,"It works just like it says it does, but absolutely no bells or whistles. Wish they would have attached minor editing software to it, or maybe have the ability to convert other file types to PES, or something! Just puts design on a card...which was the only claim. Just wish it did a little more."
3,Sport Compact Performance Books,The items looked worn on the edges of the books they did not look like they were in new condition.
2,Do yourself a favor and buy Arc of the Diver instead,"I don't own this cd right now, but had borrowed it from a friend one time. This is music that yuppies rave about. It's just too poppy and polished sounding for my tastes. I think I'll stick with Winwood's Traffic, Blind Faith, and his first two solo albums instead. Of his stuff past the Arc of the Diver album, I only like the song ""Valerie"", and that's about it. I know I'm gonna get a lot of unhelpful votes on this, because everybody who comes here to read these reviews are fanatics of Steve Winwood, but I still felt like I needed to put my two cents in about Steve the sellout. His songs are just too saccharin sweet for my tastes, but I guess everyone's different, and have different tastes in music, but if this is your thing, go for it."
3,Extra Extra,"This film holds special sentiment for me merely because I had the opportunity to work in it as an extra. We filmed in the fall of 1977, and the only recognizable actor for me at that time was Steven Oliver, who had worked a few years earlier on the NBC series "" Bracken's World "" . Later, James Daughton went on to film "" Animal House "" as Gregg Marmalard. And Kim Lankford, the quintessential girl next door, florished with a respectable career in television. The film is sophmoric and dated, but has a few cute bits. It's probably worth it just to see the young and lovely Kim Lankford again."
3,"cold tea, needs sugar","When compared to the original vinyl version, this CD is disappointing. I have come to realize that the claim ""re-mastered"" is not an indication of quality. I own several original master recordings of several artists that are truly spectacular. But, the quality standard is specific to the organization that produced the work. Apparently, re-mastered and original masters are not the same. Live and learn."
5,Hugh hits a home run...,"Very special thanks to Hugh Waddell, for creating such an awesome portrait of Johnny Cash. I will treasure this book for the rest of my life.You will all love this book. You will learn some things about Johnny that may make you laugh. Some things may make you cry. It is a beautiful journey.Kelly HancockHendersonville, TennesseeShoe size 7 1/2"
4,great look at modern Japan,"Having lived in Japan, I connected with this film immmediately. I would say that this type of Japanese filmmaking is a lot like the soaps that air on Japanese television. No incredible lighting effects, excessive props or music scores. The camera basically sits their and shows people and what they do. That's about it. I highly doubt anyone who is not Japanese or does not have an idea about what Japanese culture is like will like this film. I'm not going to go on like some people and talk about the ""artistic value"" of the film. The film is what it is, a story about a couple of guys who try to get a jellyfish to swim in fresh water."
3,never square,"armageddon is out,free,hardcore in your face challanging music.hookers drums are out front and have no time to kid around.with great support from the other master musicians on the c.d.,case in point-guitarist jesse henry sounds like a cecil taylor on acid!hookers'music is not for the weak!"
2,not hooker's best,"drumb's not too far off: armageddon finds hooker in the studio with personnel shifting on every song. hooker's a powerhouse drummer, firmly in the free-jazz tradition, and given the proper setting, his records can be transcendent.armageddon is not such a record. the tunes meander and there's too much noodling. the tinny recording quality doesn't help either.my favorite hooker record is 'mindfulness.' it's much more focused, and even grooves in a few spots. glenn spearman helps temper hooker, and hooker draws out some serious fire from late tenor saxist. start there for a much more aproachable record."
4,McKillip writes a pearl inspired by the pull of the tide.,"Something Rich and Strange offers the reader the oftenly needed crash of reality. By not losing the mystery and enchantment of the ocean, McKillip shows how humanity's blind ignorance is killing the magic found beneath the tide. Even when the powers below cry out for help they must disquise it with a Siren's Song and not frantic plea for survival. The book has a pace equal to the waves crashing on the shore, be it during a hurricane or a spring shower, that is left up for the reader to decide."
2,A book for fans,"This is the second book I have read about Tesla. While interesting, it read more like a fan's take on his achievements."
4,Great Diaper Bag for two kids!,"I have a 14 month old son and another on the way very soon...this bag is great for holding everything. i am a mom who likes to have one of EVERYTHING with me, so this bag is amply sized and well organized. I even keep a first aid kit with ice pack, bandages, etc.! I like the labeled pockets as well as extra compartments on the front and sides.Only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I wish it had little ""feet"" on the base for it to rest on when I have to put it on the ground. I hate that it gets dirty on the bottom, although so far it has always wiped clean.LOVE it overall and would recommend to anyone!"
4,"""Love it""","I think this bag is not only useful, but a diaper bag that any mother will love because it has a very classy and eliquent look to it."
2,Frustrated as well,"I love the look of this bag and fell in love with it. But I too can never find it. I even tried ebay. Well tonight, I happened to sign on and see that there was a price and it was available.... well so I thought. I went throught the check out procedure and everything went through. I went back too look at the bags again because I am looking for a masculine bag for my Marine husband who wouldn't be caught dead carrying this bag. Well... Wouldn't you know it popped up unavailable AGAIN!. I seriously doubt that I bought the last one too. So now I am just waiting for amazon to write me back telling me they are sorry, but they can't process my order. I live in a rural area, and I have no idea where a Babies R Us is down here. I think that the closest one is 2 hours away... Maybe I will have to have my family look out of state where they are and send it to me."
3,"Entertaining, but too long to point","I don't enjoy to read, but I enjoyed this book. It kept me in suspense from front to back. Joanna seemed a little weak, but maybe some people react diffrent to situations like the one in the book."
3,Not the 4.5 stars that other reviewers gave it...but not bad,"This book didn't have as many characters as some of the other Koontz books I've read, which meant I didn't get as many opportunities to see Koontz' talent at breathing life into his characters.I like it in books like From The Corner..., Watchers, Frankenstein or Odd Thomas where there's all kinds of characters w/ all kinds of lives, then they unite to battle the forces of evil.It's still a great read & very different cause it's not in the US.Give it a try & see how you like it!Here's how I rank the 14 books I've read so far:1-Odd Thomas2-Frankenstein 1 (a very very close second!)3-Frankenstein 2 (a very very close third!)4-Watchers (a very very close fourth!)5-From The Corner Of His Eye6-Lightning7-Hideaway8-Strangers9-Velocity10-Brother Odd11-The Key To Midnight12-Odd Hours13-Forever Odd14-The Taking"
2,This is a re-run in print.,"Take one part 'The House of Thunder' (beautiful woman, mysterious past, political intrigue). Add a dash of 'Strangers' (science used to play with people's minds). Mix in two scoops of 'The Door to December' (abusive parent of main character). Blend generously with 'Whispers' (in the course of solving the mystery, hero and heroine fall in love and have wild passionate sex). Bake in hot publishing oven. Serves millions"
2,Huge fan....of ANY other dada album,"Huge dada fan here. Have seen them every single time they've made it Mpls. Given that, this album is just weak, and not nearly to the level of the dada pre-hiatus era.My main complaint is the poor sound/mixing/mastering/whatever. Not sure if this comes from self-production or what (they wouldn't be the first band to suffer after doing it themselves--see King's X). My other complaint is the song writing, just not up to par.The independent projects by the guys sound fine, I'm just not sure what went wrong here. The vocals are muddy, the guitar sound is somewhere between irritating and indistinguishable, and the harmonies (core dada element) are just poor.I would suggest any of their other albums, and sure hope they they find some help with the next album...which of course I'll buy."
1,Falls apart fast,"Was pretty excited about this product from reading the high reviews. After 2 weeks of use, the abrasive paper started peeling off on both sides. Even though it says ""Waterproof"" I still made sure to dry it off & stand it up at an angle so any water I missed would drip off.I'm not sure how it could be waterproof. After it peels up, it looks like it's cardboard underneath.If this product stayed together, I would have given it a 5. But for the money this cost and how long it last, it's a big 1-star."
2,Finally!,"This book was long overdue and somewhat of a disappointment when it finally arrived. Much of the information in it is dated, but it remains important information that was long overdue to be in print. Congratulations Stanley for pulling it together. This book, albeit pricey, is a must for historical archaeologists."
1,not happy,The necklace came broken with the clasp unattached from the ribbon. Couldn't you have used something more robust for making the necklace?
3,"My mistake, but easy to do","Just beware--this isn't the original ""North Dallas Forty"", it's the sequel. The original seems to be a little harder to come by."
4,Better than most action flix,"Library DVD rental. I thought this would be another version of ""Gone In 60 Seconds"", and couldn't have been more wrong.The first 15-20 minutes was a festival of f-bombs...meh... and then it slacked off and started to get intriguing. For being all the raunchy, bloody, snafu'd plot, the character development is really impressive, although you almost don't realize it's happening. And then you're like ""oh, I've seen this story before, but not like this, wow this is really cool.""Action, check. Humor, check. Blood, check... but not gory guts, more in a he-deserved-it-haha way.Wholesome adult fun- better with beer or JD. Good entertainment value. Watch it."
2,what the...?!,"Now there is 90 min of my life that I could have spent scrubbing the staines out of my tighty whities than watch this crap. Is Nicky that broke? I only gave it two stars because the Accountant was ill, and Piper was sexy and tough. Shame on you Nicky. I did like the gun battle in the motel room though."
4,Fun & Fast Action!,"This is a great movie! It is not for those that want some moral ethics, or for some great deep drama; this is a movie for those that like fast action, lots shooting, and things blowing up. This will rank up with one of my favorite Nicolas Cage action films! I absolutely loved the female in this movie too, they allowed a female (Amber Heard) to be an extreme fighter in this movie, it made it fun to root the under guys. And yes the Accountant played William Fichtner was a wonderful addition to the action and fun of the movie."
3,nick cage,"i like all of nicks movies.i dont care what critics say ,hes great id like to meet him!!!!! yea right!!!!!"
3,unCaged!,"This is a film that just went for it in most every way. It didn't work completely, but they tried.No doubt an action and effects-fest. The acting...eh. Some of the CGI was weak, but I didn't expect too much going in. I also thought the story was unbelievable, borderline hard to follow. But again I wasn't watching this for story, I rented this for two other reasons. Nicolas Cage and Amber Heard.I'm a HUGE Cage fan, and this is typical of what he's done the past many years now. Quirky, yet action films. He will not convert or lose any fans here. Now Amber Heard, she will be gaining many fans. Sexy is the only word that comes to mind. In this film she's a bit feisty too.It doesn't make my list of classics, but it's definitely entertaining."
5,Drive Angry.,"Drive Angry, the two main stars are the '69 Charger 440 and the '71 Chevelle SS. Great twist on the old classic car chase movies! Piper is a kick ass gal that cant hold her own against about anyone. I'm glad to see that this 'new' car chase movie went back to the basics on most of the car chases, and left the CGI special effects craps to the other losers out there, yes 'Nick' I am referring to you. I'd love to see the producers do a new twist on Vanishing Point, cause I kinda' feel like this is a new age Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry, with a ton of attitude. How could you not love a bar called 'The Bull by the Balls?' 11 out of 10 in my book. Can't go wrong if you love car chase movies."
5,should've bought this to begin with!!!,i just sold my phil and ted's so i could get this stroller and i am so happy i did!!! the phil and ted's was a very cool stroller but didn't suit our day to day needs. i fell like i only used it on walks and such b/c it was kind of a pain for everyday use. i just got the caboose in the other day and i love it! it is so light and very easy to steer. my 2 1/2 year old loves to sit on the back :) she feels like a big girl! my 7 month old also like it too. she fits very comfortably in the front and i love that there is a snack tray! the stroller also folds up very nicely. it is a bit long with the sun shade and snack tray but i just take them off and put them back on when i need them. i also love the parent organizer! it's perfect! i love this stroller and only wish i had gotten it to begin with!
4,worth the price,"Bought this about a month ago for my 3 month old and 3 year old, and so far, very happy with it. I have a Graco sungride infant seat that fits nicely and my older child can sit or stand, so I can keep her within reach too. Easy to open and close, easy to maneuver, just wish it was a little lighter. It does take up a lot of trunk space and I have a regular size SUV, so for those with compact cars, check out the measurements before buying. Great for walking around the mall or paved roads, not very good on grass or rough terrain. The basket is very small and doesn't hold much, but I didn't buy this for the basket."
4,Great stroller for infant/toddler and a preschooler,"We haved used the stroller for a month and have taken it on a couple of airplane trips and it has been super to use. It is very easy to steer and feels solid over bumps and curbs. It is well designed with a high, foam padded handle and a neoprene 2-bottle holder and zip pocket. My 3 1/2 year old daughter loves her spot and it has been a huge relief to be able to contain and transport her, along with my infant son.My biggest complaint is that the under-the-seat basket is hard to access (you have to manuever through the back seat) and it is not very big. Also, the stroller is still very big when folded and I have not been able to purchase a travel cover/bag for it since it folds down longer than even traditional double strollers."
1,Look elsewhere!,"Got this at Target and it was ""okay"". The 2 units stay together with magnetics which are on each of the units. Our biggest problem was the volume control was not loud enough. Our kids are too young for headphones so this was a problem. The extras were nice - headphones, guardian. Took back. Looking for something better."
1,Thank goodness for the extended warranty!,"I purchased this at Target in July, 2007. Because we have had trouble with various electronic gadgets, we decided to buy the extended warranty (3 years for $19). Good thing we did. This unit was purchased for our longer road trips. It really didn't have that many hours on it. Unfortunately, it failed on our recent 800 mile road trip. This was only 5 months after purchase. The kids were upset, as that was their main form of entertainment for the long ride. Since they were unhappy, we were all miserable (you know how that goes!). I have contacted the Service Plan people and they will be sending me a credit for the amount paid once they receive the broken unit from me. It is unlikely I will purchase this Disney unit again. However, based on our track record, it seems like unless you're willing to pay good money for top brand electronics, none of them last very long."
1,junk,"We purchased this unit at Target last month. Fortunately we tried it out at home before leaving on a long road trip. It worked great... for about 45 seconds! Then the main screen went to static and we smelled a strong electrical smell. We brought it back to Target and received a full refund. We expected that Disney would only put their name on a quality prodoct, but sadly we were wrong!"
2,Disney Dual Screen DVD Player,"On the positive side: I love that it has two screens. I love how easy it is to strap to the headrest and it is at just the right level for the kids to watch. The remote works fine, and the controls on the main unit are easy to use. The picture is clear and bright on both screens.On the negative side: It was a little expensive. You can only use it in your car, there is no battery, so it's not truly ""portable."" The sound quality is poor, and the sound fades in and out so much it is incredibly annoying.All in all, the negatives win out over the positives; I would definitely not purchase again."
3,Not as moving as Id hoped it to be...(3 1/2 stars),"I liked ""Entwined"" well enough..but i didnt love it. It started out fantastically, but I felt like it lost its way somewhere towards the last third of the book. I enjoyed the characters of Isobel and Nathan , but thought that they lacked chemistry.I also found it annoying the way that Isobel just accepted her familys drunken irresponsible behavior as if it were only a slight annoyance. I would have liked to have gotten to know some of the secondary characters better..especially some of Nathans spy friends. All in all not bad, but not one Id read again."
3,A BIT OUTDATED,THIS TWO DISC PRODUCT FOCUSES ON SITUATIONS 20 YEARS AGO IN ONE CD AND 10 YEARS AGO IN THE OTHER... a BIT OUTDATED RELATIVE TO GANG STRATEGIES AND CURRENT INFORMATION.
2,Pitiful exorcist story,"Pitiful exorcist story with a big budget, think of all the little movies that could have used any part of this budget to make there movies better and you see this bloated whale of a movie just sucking down the bucks for the actors, sets and location not to mention the ton's of dough they blew to advertise this waste of cash. I should have went with my gut when I saw the first trailer, I thought now this is another one of those non-scary catholic mumbo jumbo hocus pocus movies to take my mind off of the real scary things about the catholic church.Anthony Hopkins can be a great actor when the man has something to work with but not here, ol Tony is just collecting a pay check as he mumbles his way through this mess. Do not support this movie, instead watch the original Exorcist movie."
5,"Even my friend the Priest said, ""Not too bad...""!!!","I used this for research. It was not bad....but I'm not too deep into the theology yet to say how 'on' it was. However, I am very good friends with several clergy, and one of the stodgiest of them saw it, and said ""It's not too bad, I was surprised...Hollywood usually butchers everything about the Church. They didn't this time....not totally."""
4,"Comfortable, practical","I have owned a pair of these a year or more and have probably laundered them 30-40 times. They are very comfortable for me, though comfort is highly variable for each person. The material is light weight but appears of good quality and I do not detect any deterioriation. At first I was concerned about the elastic which appeared narrow and weak, but it still feels as strong as when new and holds fine. I will purchase more of these to have in a mix of styles.About the same time as I purchased these boxers I purchased a couple pair of Faconnable boxers at about twice the price with similarly light weight material. One pair of these ripped recently. My experience is the CK material is holding up better than the Facconable that costs twice as much.I doubt these will elicit much commentary from significant or potentially significant others."
3,A CD with some shining Moments,"Being from San Diego, I have been familier with this band for quite some time, and they have always been a consistently good punk'n'roll band. Their new album, however, did not live up to my expectations. There were a number of brilliant songs, such as American Rock'n'Roll and e. But the rest of the album drowns in a sea of mediocracy, with uninspired lyrics and run of the mill instrumentals. My opinion: get the mp3s of the two songs i mentioned, but ditch the Cd, unless your collection is lacking some local SD punk."
3,Please read a book before reviewing,"I was amazed that the person below thought to put a review in for a book he hasn't read.From the Dymocks web site's description of the book gives a more accurature description. ""Bryce Courtney's beloved son Damon, a haemophiliac, died from medically-acquired AIDS on Aprils Fool's day 1991, at the age of 24.""Damon did not chose to have haemophilia, he didn't chose to have blood transfusions and he didn't chose to get HIV. Drugs addiction is not an issue here. It is about a disease caught by no fault of the victim."
5,Everything and more,"FINALLY Echos is out, i've been waiting for months and it's finally here. However it was well worth the wait. From heaven, to echos, to sister saviour, this album is one of their new best. I was at their show at the El Rey in L.A. last night and bought it and am totally excited about it. I'de give the album 5 stars totally because it has their slower awesome songs, and house of jealous lovers :) GO BUY IT!"
2,Can't Cure the wannabe blues,"2 1/2Derivative + self-consciously edged out enough to warrant hipster mockery in spats, Echoes nonetheless is shakingly solid enough to investigate, especially if one is inclined towards the disposable spectrum of indie music."
4,dont be turned off by the hype.,"i heard ""house of jealous lovers"" around and orginally thought it was boring, derivative, even though, im an indie rock fan, i didn't want to hear alot of indie rock soundalike bands.i'm not sure what did it, boredom, yearning for new music, or the reviews here, but i decided to give echoes a chance.boy, am i glad i did. echoes is not at all derivative but a fresh, mix of disco, new wave, funk, and indie. melodic distortion.the rapture captures that perfect mix of cheesy vocals, not trying too hard, and almost Cure like stark beauty. great album all the way through.try this. you wont be disappointed."
2,Like an echo - A weaker version of the original stuff,"It's a sad comment on the state of the music scene today that this is one of the best albums of the year, which it is. There are a couple of catchy tunes, but some dull instrumentation and very lame lyrics."
2,"If I Want Gothic New Wave, I'll Hear The Cure, Thanks!","I was born in 85, the middle of the 80s, right smack-dab in the middle of the eras of New Wave and that god-awful, spandex-clad pop metal! I soaked up enough of this new wave-ish stuff when I was little kid. There were only two bands with this sound that I could get my head around: The Cure, and The Talking Heads (and with the Talking Heads, I only really liked ""Once In A Lifetime."")Maybe I'm biased, but my point is, I personally don't go for this new-wave, post-punk stuff. If you like the nostalgiac feeling it gives you, then by all means. It's just not my cup of tea.But that being said, I will admit that the album was very well done. The production was great - there were no kinks or missteps as far as that. But the singer has a horribly annoying voice. He has a high-pitched whine that sounds like it would more likely attract the howling of dogs than the howling of fans.There. I've bashed these guys enough."
4,Southern charm.,"Elizabethtown starring Orlando Bloom and Kirsten Dunst was a pleasant surprise I must say. I remember when this Cameron Crowe film was released in 2005, it got horrible reviews from the critics so I avoided seeing it for a long time. Turns out Elizbethtown is an underrated gem! The chemistry between Bloom and Dunst is very cute and relaxed. Judy Greer is a delight as Bloom's sister and actually for once, Susan Sarandon gives a solid performance. Elizabethtown has a lot of colorful humor and grace, the beginning of the film is kind of a drag but I truly enjoyed this well-written slice of southern charm. Enjoy!"
3,Worth watching (once or maybe twice),"You can read the synopsis of the movie above...but...I find the dark humor to be engaging and the best part of the whole show. That feeling continues throughout the entire movie, even as Dunst does her best to save Bloom from himself.The music, especially toward the end of the show, is downright entrancing, and makes the movie worth watching.Much of the storyline seems a bit contrived and unbelievable, though it's a story we'd like to believe could happen (but it's not at all likely).The acting is OK, but there was never really any threat of Oscars being offered up to this effort.This show is a must-have item if you are a confirmed Kirsten Dunst or Orlando Bloom fan, but for the rest of us, once or twice will probably take care of our ""Elizabethtown"" viewing needs.3 stars...no more, no less."
3,Relatable,"This movie is repeatedly in my DVD player.I just enjoy watching these people discover who they are from another's perspective.They are funny, moronic, serious, grieving, insecure and egotistical in turn.They are human.I like this movie.I like watching it with my dad.It just isn't gross.(There isn't a creepy disgusting sex scene but there is one where a little kid quickly vomits.)Check it out."
3,"Great Sountrack, Surreal Moments","Great Soundtrack!I kind of liked this movie even though I felt it was very long. There are more than a few sort of surreal moments during the movie that I was left looking at the screen and wondering what in the heck was that about (particularly in during the memorial service), but there are times when my real world life is kinda surreal, so I guess a movie can do the same.I thought Orlando Bloom came across more as an accomplished actor in this movie rather than something to look at in a movie. It was nice to see that he can actually act.This movie is worthy of renting if you have a long evening you need to fill and a burning desire to see Susan Saradon tap dance."
4,"Romance, Humor and lots of Creative Story Twists","Great soundtrack. Treasure map was awesome. Interesting and thought-provoking concept to think of oneself as a substitute person, like they are are not a real player in their own life. Romantic, good humor, very little objectionable content, didn't need it at all to keep it done well and very entertaining.In the end love is more important than losing a billion dollars Who can say more?"
2,Snooze,"There was potential, sure, but in the end, I was glad when it got there and wasn't sure what the point was."
1,They should have an alternate beginning where Orlando Bloom does kill himself,"Orlando Bloom tries to act too cute by trying to channel the karma of Johnny Depp, and it just does not work. Kirsten Dunst basically just acts cute throughout the whole movie. So, if you like movies about two cute people acting cute, then this movie is for you."
1,"Lame Music, Lame Plot, Lame everything!",I found this movie to be so extremely dull!! The plot was lame the lines were lame. Nothing in this movie was interesting!!
2,"A misfire from the writer/director of ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Almost Famous""","""Elizabethtown"" is a misfire from Cameron Crowe the writer/director of ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Almost Famous"".The life of Drew Baylor (Orlando Bloom) is falling apart when he suddenly gets a phone call from his sister saying that their father has died. He journeys back to his home town in Kentucky and meets perky flight attendant Claire Colburn (Kirsten Dunst) along the way.Orlando is no leading man and Kirsten - although cute - is miscast as a screwball. There is no chemistry between them whatsever. There are echoes of Crowe's brilliant ""Jerry Maguire"" in the plot starting with Baylor's downfall at the beginning of the film - but the ideas are tired and unfocussed and ""Elizabethtown"" is flat and uninteresting - not too mention neverending.Being a Crowe film it does have good music but that's about it. Coming after the disaster of ""Vanilla Sky"", Crowe appears to have lost his touch."
3,For optimistic people,"Drew Baylor loses the shoe company he works for almost a billion dollars. He designed a shoe that flopped horribly on the market. He wants to kill himself. But he gets called by his family to take care of his father's funeral arrangement. Him being a dutiful son, he decides to put off suicide until he returns home. But he meets a flight attendant while going to take care of business and romance ruins his plans.I thought it was a sweet, charming movie. It stars a couple of cute, likable young people, Orlando Bloom and Kirsten Dunst. It had a nice pace and I was just drawn into the story.I think lots of people will be bored by this even if I did like it. It's for people who want something uplifting or comfort food for the soul. It would be great to watch after a difficult day."
2,Over-Acted.,"I'll tell you the truth - I purchased this film only so I could say I now own every movie Alan Rickman has ever done. He, as any fan will tell you, brings vivid life to every character he does. His portrayal of Ed the Artist is absolutely what I expected - well done, although the part was small.Now, for the rest of the movie. I have never witnessed overacting like this in my life -- not even on the high school stage. The plot was thin and disjointed, (what do Virgo, prime numbers and Neil Sedaka all have in common? Did I miss something?) and the scene where they finally catch the murderer is some of the worst acting I've seen.I've given it two stars strictly because of Alan Rickman's involvement in the film and because I did stick it out until the end. If you are a fan, rent this just to hear him say, ""Don't molest anything-""..."
1,Very Frustrated,"The first book in this series came out in Sept. of '03. The second February of '06. The third ........ nonexistant. I guess I wouldn't mind as much if the second didn't end the way it did. A major cliffhanger leading up to the third book. No response when I e-mailed her. Of course, it did take her three years to write the second ... maybe I'm jumping the gun a bit. oh well, we'll see."
4,personal tale set amidst the backdrop of Saddam's Iraq,"The author tells a fascinating tale of life inside Iraq. Being the son of one of Saddam's closest advisors, he had access to much interesting information. Iraqis are taught to hate Israelis, but Hussein Sumaida never did buy into the hate. He would often sneak into his father's ""banned books"" stash and read books about Israeli heroes. He grew up wanting to defect to Israel and become a spy. The story he tells is fascinating, and well worth the read.A reviewer said Hussein Sumaida is blinded by hatred of jews. I don't know what book that person read, but it wasn't this one. Hussein is very forthright about his liking of Jews and Israel, despite the propaganda the people of Iraq are subjected to. Overall a very exciting book."
5,Beautiful Film,"The best thing about this movie is its breathtaking cinematography. The shots, colors, composition, everything, makes it one of the most visually interesting movies I have seen in some time.On another level, the story is great. Its about the tragedy of love but it is done in a very unique way. These three stories (tied together by a red chord) touch on variety of human emotions. This is a must see in my book."
4,Cute little book,"As every dog owner knows, dogs live completely in the moment. It seems entirely fitting for a book like this to reveal the members of the canine kingdom for the happy little Buddhas that they are, through 50 black-and-white photographs paired with quotes from various Zen sources. I also highly recommend another little book of Eastern wisdom titled ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life"" by Taro Gold which is filled with hundreds of insightful quotes to inspire and enlighten."
1,HD REMAKE PLEASSSSSE!!!VIVENDI???,I just loved these games back in the days!I loved all the nice colours and they tought me English! But this Collection is a huge load of crap on a WIN.7 machine!!!Sorry as can be but there seem to be no future for all these beloved SIERRA Adventures that have cought the hearts and minds of so many a people!!!VIVENDI GAMES just doesent not know what a goldmind they have to start making HD remakes???DO THEY???OR CANT THEY???VIVENDI PLEASE LET US HAVE OUR FUN AND YOU WILL HAVE YOUR INCOME!!!
1,"again, terrible graphics","I purchased Space Quest, Kings Quest and Leisure Suit Larry for the husband. Like the others, Kings Quest was not enhanced in any way which is a shame. With all the technology today they could have done a little enhancement. In any event, the graphics look terrible on larger monitors and is simply not worth the money. Think twice before buying the game, if you don't mind very poor graphics (which by the way makes it difficult to play)then go for it."
3,Some of the games didn't work.,The fourth game did not work. It kept asking me for words in the text of a game handbook that didn't come with the software. The Seventh game did not work. It kept telling me I didn't have 256 colors (which I do have) so it could not play the game.The rest of the games work.
3,KINGS QUEST,"King's Quest is an old game from the early 90's. It is a slow moving game and requires thought,concentration and observation along with a lot of patience. When you have nothing to do it will help pass the time."
3,i wish the bolt was longer,"the bolt that came with the hanger wasn't long enough to hold the two hanger pieces together for my ibeam. i'd say the one that come with is about 3"". i ended up having to go to my local hardware store and buying a 6"" one to give me more length than i needed for $1.60. but after i tried using that, then the nut that came with wouldn't fit the threads on my new bolt, so i had to go back to the hardware store and by another nut for about 40 cents.i also purchased a ringside heavy bag and the bolt's girth fits the carabiner pretty snugly.overall, it's a decent purchase, but i feel like it should've been a bit cheaper and the product description should've been better."
2,"Not 4.5 x 3 x 3.5"", more like 3.5 x 3 x 3.5""","The bolt that came with the hanger was not the same as the one seen in the picture. The one I received was only 1.5"" and not 3"". Not long enough when you have a 4"" I-beam. If they would have sent the same bolt in the picture then 4.5 x 3 x 3.5 would be accurate."
3,Seriously?,"Even though the 2 pieces of this hanger worked to get the job done, it only came with a 1.5 inch bolt!!! Seriously?? This would not have even been long enough to hang it from a 2x4 let alone a steel beam. After a trip the a local hardware store for a 10"" bolt AND lock nut, the job is complete and it works just fine."
1,Lame book,This book does not even begin to scratch the surface on what's required to succeed in resort sales.There are MANY MANY books and tapes that do succeed.
5,A New Concept,I think it was one of the best Buffet offerings yet. It was cleverly done and was a good musical for the book. I liked the island music and the distinct accent of the singers. The book was wonderful and that helped the music.
2,"It's Jimmy, but it's not Jimmy.","If you are looking for the feel of past albums -don't look here. This is contract work from a book that he had very little input for. Stick to the ""pen a song-write a chapter in a book"" model-and every-one will buy Jimmy Buffett CD's and Books forever."
1,"The ""enhanced"" features of this CD never worked.","Although I am a Buffett fan, I'm not a fan of this CD. First of all, I was disappointed in that the ""enhanced"" features never worked on my computer. I worked for hours to get anything out of it, and got nowhere. I wrote to the record company and received no response. Second, as far as the music goes, it probably worked well in the context of the musical, but, standing alone, the songs are tunes I just don't want to listen to more than a couple of times. I don't recommend this CD"
2,2 1/2,"I never get tired of looking at Cerina Vincent. That alone earns it the two and a half star rating.Beyond that, not much to be desired. On a down note, Cerina as sworn off doing nudity, and that's a damn shame."
2,Tries to be something it's not,"With such a great title this could have been a cool movie but it wants to be too many things: Drama, mythilogical,and romance. This all draws away from the horror and in the end it turns out being one thing: Crap."
3,A LONG WAIT,"IT WAITS is a notch above many similar-themed movies, but does suffer from trying to be a psychological study as well. Cerina Vincent plays Danni, a forest ranger who feels guilty after the auto accident death of her best friend, Julie. Moreso because everyone thought Julie was driving, but Danni was actually behind the wheel. She has a supportive and loving boyfriend, Justin, and she has turned to booze for escape. What this has to do with the movie is not clearly stated, but once the monster starts killing off people, IT WAITS becomes a pretty intense and spooky thriller. While the monster isn't up to standards these days, it's not as bad as some of the more obvious men in costume howlers. It also has the cutest parrot, Hoppy, seen in recent movies..a point for that original addition. Cerina Vincent and Dominic Spangrora are allright in the leading roles."
2,Waiting for the action to happen!,"The only way to acurately describe this movie? a horror film pre-empted by a lifetime drama. This film dragged bigtime with some b.s. about Cerina Vincents characters guilt over a car accident she caused that kills her friend...lush! The amount of time spent on these flashbacks of drunken guiltiness has nothing to do with the problem at hand; some supernatural creature killing everyone in the forest valley. I would have given this film another star if it had one of two things, more gore,or if Cerina vincent took off her top. Bottom line..Dull."
1,It Waits,It Waits is a A Jeepers Creepers Carbon copy almost. it is a little scary and it's not horrible but it kind of drags on and the monster could have been scarier.
1,Don't bother................,"The Netflix guys didn't fire the filmmakers because the camera crew went nuts after 5 days of no sleep, they fired them because the camera crew got smashed-drunk and acted like morons. The people actually participating in the world record are the ones with no sleep whatsoever and they seem completely fine during the movie. The presenter starts acting more and more like an idiot, probably in a desperate effort to make this incredibly boring documentary more interesting. He fails. I'm not even going to re-gift this DVD, that's how bad it is...."
1,Do not buy!,"This video is terrible. It is waaaaaaaaayyyyy to slow!!!! I just bought it and it should not be considered a workout video. If someone is totally new at yoga and wants to see someone get into each move very slowly and listen to them talk this is the DVD for you. If you want a workout this is not for you! Now, I'm oversees and have to order a new DVD."
4,Session 1 definitely for beginners,"I really enjoyed Seane's inspiration and thorough instruction... however, I was looking for something a little different. What's most important to know about this DVD is: Seane painstakingly talks through each pose, which can be very helpful, but she is obviously addressing one with little experience. Or she's just going at a very slow pace. Because of this, the session ends up being very long and I could see myself losing interest after a few runs. I was looking for a shorter routine that I could easily follow along with and use perhaps daily to jump start my day. I wish I would have know more about the format b/c I probably wouldn't have ordered it since I am an intermediate yoga student. Don't get me wrong, this is a nice yoga DVD with great instruction for beginners. Seane is great, she's the kind of yoga teacher you'd want in class."
5,This IS Vinyasa Flow!,"So many teachers out there today claim to be teaching Vinyasa Flow, however, Seane Core IS teaching Vinyasa Flow! Shes a master at teaching breath with movement! She is also such an inspiration to anyone taking her class live... AND in this DVD. What I like the most, is the second DVD where you actually get to see her put it all together. Then, you truly get a feel for how beautiful Vinyasa flow is! My hat's (or should I say yoga mat) off to you Seane Corn... the Flow guru! TAMARA'S YOGA FUSION"
4,Beautifully done but ....,"What a marvelous yoga practice from Seane Corn! I did the 1st DVD and felt as though I left a one-on-one instructional yoga class. I have rarely felt that way with any yoga videos I have done (except maybe Bryan Kest's original Power Yoga series). A very powerful yoga session. As a comment to those that say this is for beginner's, I've been practicing yoga (Iyengar, Power, and Hatha/vinyasa) since 1998- so I'm not a beginner but still found the instruction valuable. Seane is obviously a rare and thorough yoga teacher.The 2nd DVD left much to be desired- I intend on following the 1st DVD for awhile before embarking on the 2nd session. No verbal cueing was not a practical idea, even though I believe she intended for the viewer to manage their own home practice. Hopefully, that will help me with the 2nd DVD. I intend on getting her second yoga DVD, she is that good!"
3,"Yes, good for beginners","I have to agree with the reviewer who said this is geared for beginners. If you're someone who has any familiarity with the Ashtanga primary series, looking for an alternative flow-type series, moving at a moderate pace, this DVD is not it."
5,excellent,this book was very good 2 thumbs up! I read it for a book report book. It was good in the first chapter it is an introduction on Almanzo and his family.Onward Almanzo does many things he buys his own lemonade with his own money. Later on the story gets more interesting...In the story there is no one problem for Almanzo.In the story their pig Lucy got candy all over her teeth because Almanzo gave her sticky candy.Almanzo and his sisters had to chase the pig down.This was not easy for them to do. In the process Lucy ripped a hole through Almanzo's blouse. I think this book was good and I think you all should read this.I would recommend this book to a friend. I think other people will like it too. It'll be a nice book for all ages. I think this book will be on the shelves for many more years to come.So everybody should read it.
2,Farmer Boy.....Farmer Boy......Farmer Boy,"Farmer Boy is about a boy that lives on a farm. On that farm they have colts, and Almanzo wants to train the colt. Almanzo's dad will not let Almanzo train the colts because his dad thinks that he is too small and not old enough.I think the author Laura Ingalls Wilder is trying to say is that nothing comes easy, and you have to work for something that you want really much. Another lesson that the author tried to tell is that you should never lie.I liked this book because when you read the book Farmer Boy you never want to stop reading it because there is always action in this book. Another part why I really liked reading this book is because when they describe something you can almost see is. Read this book and find out if Amanzo can train the colts. IT'S GREAT BOOK!..."
3,it was alittle confusing.you need to pay close attention!,"the acting was very well done. but the plot was alittle off. too many flashbacks, and there was really no plot. it was about people killing eachother,for money. the story line could of been better, but the selection of actors was very good."
5,An irresistible historical fiction,"I'm an avid armchair space- and time-traveler, and this book whizzed me away and made me want to stay there until I was done. The sights, smells, sounds, and textures of pristine, rural Appalachia are powerfully evoked in this brilliant first novel, which also happens to have a creative and compelling plot.I heartily disagree with the reader who found the speech of the characters contrived; don't/didn't people in different places and times speak differently than we do? I found the dialogue to mirror the psychological portraits that were painted of the characters - women who, for example, said ""hush now"" and nurtured men who, by modern definitions, tried to rape them. I very much enjoyed this book's exploration of morality, religion, spirituality, societal roles and expectations of women, midwives' roles in and attitudes towards women's health and birth in that time and place. This is a wonderful book on so many levels."
1,Sappy drivel,"synopsis - Elizabeth Whitely learns the realities of life.The characters are quite unbelievable, everyone has strong qualities, and is better than us. The setting is nothing special. Neither is the story. Love stories are a dime a dozen.Take a close look at some of these positive reviews and ask yourself if they aren't shills hyping the book. The authors style is nothing special, and neither is the story. Whats so interesting about it?"
5,Touching and entertaining,"What a great film. With all of the high-tech action movies out there, this is very refreshing, down-to-earth tale that is wonderful for everyone in the family."
4,Good purchase,Very pleased with the unit. It is installed under a kitchen cabinet and because it is compact it saves space. Very easy to install and works well. Excellent picture and color.
1,low quality burns from TV rips,How can you fit 80 episodes on a single CD? By having very low quality video and audio. These are not the legit 7-DVD series of dragon ball's Mexico translation.
1,boring,This and its companion (#1) are boring. No student (ESL or native English speaker) will be entertained by them. Go back to the Conjunction Junction-type videos if you're looking for a creative presentation.
1,Not worth a star maybe half star,"In my simple opinion, this was a 6minutes documentary made into a movie... No build up and no conclusion just childish and undecided sex scene............. Lucky it can be rented in USA, bought mine in UK and ready to resell for half price...worst 2011 movie"
4,good,This was a very good movie. Not the best Ive seen lately but still one of the better ones. Its hard to find a really good lesbian movie :(
3,Just watch it,"Point blank. It is movie to watch and judge w/i your own terms. The hopeful ending I ached for? Well, welcome to real life. At the same time, the chemistry between the two? You could watch w/o the sound on! Whatever you do, do not listen to commentary. Let yourself interpret the film."
1,Grrrr...,I'm eating a box of these Nabisco Animal Crackers right now. The cookies are almost like graham crackers but leave a funny aftertaste in your mouth. I would not get this again. Time to go find some milk...
3,Has its moments but not as good as her other albums,"Below the waves is not as well developed as other collections of Heidi Berry's music. It contains the same rich, haunting vocals and soft melodies but lacks the real depth of later outputs.A good buy but not quite up the the standards of 'Love' or 'Miracles'"
5,Believer,Christina Millian has sooo much talent its a shame she isnt out there. Believer is the best song ever and shows off her amazing vocal range! The movie was funny and the soundtrack is really good! enjoy!
1,Disappointing Purchase,"I was very disappointed with my purchase. The CD was scratched and therefore relatively unusable. And though the CD did not cost very much, one would hope it was still worth purchasing. It was not worth the cost of reshipping and therefore I'll mark this purchase as a loss."
5,Great book to read for self reflection,"This is a great book if your are looking to dig deeper into your conscious and understanding of yourself. It is not a book that replaces psychotherapy but it does help as a guide into your thoughts and feelings of anxiety, loneliness, self awareness."
2,Parandera rebelde y atrevida,I ordered this Cd most especially for the song la mentada contestada and the Song was not even on this Cd and the songs on the Cd are not listed correctly. Not sure if this is a an original cd or a copy not made well. I love jennis music but I'm not sure what happened here.
1,"""0"" stars and a waste-o-money","The Amazon Marketplace seller was fantastic! The product was just not worth returning.The product is outdated and without a tutorial or book, one is left to figure it out on your own.Well, I'm a pretty savvy person, so I just took a peek at some of the sample 3-D views. They made 1975 verson of ""Pong"" look high tech. (I exaggerate only slightly.) Very poor software by virtue of it being very angular, choppy, pixelated, and outdated.The other thing is the distributor (producer?) is Broderbund. Yes the harbinger of cheaply produced software.So... soon this software will not be available at all and we can all be happy. :-D"
1,Vila not to be trusted,"I know a man who knows Vila and says that Vila is a total sell-out for money and the high life. Vila will promote any junk if paid enough. For This Old House he was the creator and producer. That is the guy who makes all the money, and Vila was ""the star"" even though he din't know how to do any of the remodel work himself! P.T. Barnum lives!He is a self-promoter first and foremost, with anything else of any quality far down the list.And, this software and the EdenPure heaters he pumps are overpriced junk, just like all else he promotes. Read Consumer Reports for the truth."
1,Men's Seiko automatic stainless steel watch,"I bought this watch from Amanzon about two month ago, it work only over a month,then it run and stop, time was never right, not only I left it on bed side for over night, even it's on my hand all day long, I can not return it,because it is over 30 day.I'm very bad luck to have this junk ."
3,"Nice, but...","For the price this is a very nice watch. However, after owning it for a while, I find it hard to keep wound. Unless you plan to constantly wear this watch it won't stay wound. I even have a winding machine, and this barely keeps the watch going. Please consider this before you buy."
5,The perfect gift!,"This is a perfect gift ... wonderful coffeetable item. Buying vases without seeing them is a shot in the dark, but this turned out to be really nice. It's heavy and the design on it is very pretty - bronzy, copper, gold. It was also packed well, a box inside another box with lots of padding, so it arrived in perfect condition. I think it was a great buy."
5,Ms. Houston leaves you once again wanting more,"Love the short stories that Pam Houston writes. She leaves you wanting to run off on your own adventure. She is able to tell you the story and make you believe you are there. Having been to ""Hope"" her descriptions continue to make me want to ""GO WEST"""
5,The most underratted of all PIXIES releases,"There are no missed notes on this record. Where Doolittle cleaned up the punknes of Pilgrim and Surfer, Bossanova was the first record of a familiar band doing something almost completly different. The Pixies could have easily spit out three more record the same if not better in quality then doolittle. But they didn't they challenged themselves and created the best surf record the beachboys never made."
3,A Hit and Miss Record from a Legendary Group,"This is probably the Pixies' weakest album, especially disapointing when stacked against it's precursor, the legendary ""Dolittle"". It obviously lacks the care-free feel & innovation of their earlier work, and got a icey reception when it was first released.But even then, the Pixies' weakest album is still a pretty good one. There are some nice futuristic, spacy songs like ""All Over the World""; and ""The Happening"" was good enough to be ripped off by the Bloodhound Gang for their hit ""Fire Water Burn"".The album's main problem is a weak start and slightly labored delivery (and the silence of Kim Deal didn't help), but it's really not a bad addition into their catalogue and there is more than enough for fans to enjoy. It's high points are better than those in the follow-up, ""Trompe Le Monde"", it's just not as consistant. That's the negative part of being an amazing rock band - *good* albums just aren't good enough."
4,Elton John's classic years,This is a nice follow up to his debut but a little disjointed and takes awhile to get into. But this is not ear candy so the price one must pay; a classic nonetheless. The remastering is impeccable and a collection essential.
5,The great feelings haven't changed since I was 13,"I got this album when I was just turned 13, in 1971. Even then, though innocent, I recognized the deeply sensual nature of songs like ""Come Down in Time"" and ""Amoreena"". I think ""Where to Now St. Peter"" is one of my very favorites and all the songs are just incredible. I would listen to it over and over (as teens will). Now my son is turning 15, has had piano and other musical instrument lessons, and thinks Elton John walks on water! It's so fun, so meaningful to turn your kid on to something you really value and find that they feel the same way. I can't wait to buy the CD (I played my album to death) and play it for him. ""Burn Down the Mission"" is one of his favorites, but wait until he get a load of the others! If you like early Elton, you must experience this CD."
5,A Must Have,"I have numerous compilations in my music library and this has gotten the most wear. As a being who has grown up through the 60's and 70's world of amazing music, this is a must have for anyone who appreciates the finer aspects of music.This is so much better than his pop radio hits. Just listen."
2,Over doing it,"This album is way too moany for the dramatic styling Pulp is going for. The musical textures can be nice (This Is Hardcore, The Fear) but they don't match the vocals which don't match the lyrics. Maybe next time."
1,This cd is in a different class.,"Its hard to believe how much I enjoyed their previous cd ""Different Class"", and how much I dislike this one. I should have known the critics would prefer this one. Afterall, its bereft of all the charm, melodies, and likeability of ""Different Class"". In otherwords an obvious effort to be different, like it or not. I don't. Do yourself a favor; buy their previous release."
5,The Best,Dark Swagger is a perfect description as a previous reviewer stated. I still pull this on in a dark humid night and feel a mischevious and aroused attitude with these lyrics and music. If in the mood: listen and mix with the heaviest of liquor and a nice female
2,"Sure, it's artistic, but it's barely listenable!","It's very true that Pulp is among the most talented bands out there right now. Their ability to change directions with this album is impressive. In its own way, it's as much a work of art as ""Different Class."" Having said that, ""This Is Hardcore"" will be unlistenable for many who really liked ""Different Class."" This one's definitely in a class of its own. My head tells me this is a brilliant recording, but my ears tell me another story altogether! It's a brilliant recording that remains filed among my other CDs and never gets selected for listening. I'm simply never in the mood for it."
1,Don't buy this saw yet - it's a prototype with no quality control.,"I bought this saw a week ago and it is still not running correctly. The front Biesmeyer fence bracket had one hole drilled incorrectly and had to be replaced. The back bracket interferes with the blade gaurd. The whole thing vibrates enough to put waves on the surface of a glass of water placed on the table. Delta says the belt just needs to be worn in. I think it's a faulty motor, but I have to humor them by running it for hours to convince them. There is no mobile base available for this saw yet.If you want to troubleshoot and tinker with a saw that is still really just a prototype, you'll love this saw. If you want to actually use a saw though, forget it. I've lost a week of work screwing around with this dog. They make you assemble and adjust things they could have done just as easily at the factory. I don't want to work for Delta assembling saws. I want to USE the saw. I will never buy Delta again."
1,What a disappointment!,"This video is terrible. There must be hundreds of books with illustrations on the Franco Prussian war and yet they use the same pictures and engravings over and over again. They also over employ film related to the napoleonic wars and even WWI. There is no real critical analysis of the military campaigns, which is what I was really expecting. I was sadden to realize that I has wasted my money"
3,I WAS BORED.,The plot is clever but its a boring read with all the filler. Higgins shoulda pared it down to novella size and tossed all the dull stuff.
2,Disappointed,My wife knows her shoe size. We ordered according to her shoe size and the slippers were too small. The item was fine otherwise. We had to return them. The vendor should know his product and warn people that the sizes run small so that we could avoid the error and pay for shipping that was unnecessary.
1,actually i'd give it negatives if i could!!!,"this has to be the most awful, pathetic, horrible, head throbbing, ear splitting, discrase to a rock and roll album that i have ever had the misfortune to listen to. i mean i would rather listen to spice girls and watch teletubbies on ice. i mean nothing can get much worse than this. ...! as soon as i got in my 76' chevette and popped it in my tape player, i could of swore my ears started bleeding. so i took the tape out and threw it out my window. and a huge semi 18 wheeler came passing me and crushed it into a zillion pieces. and thats where it belongs...on the side of the road in a zillion pieces so it wont harm anyone elses music listening. GOODBYE!"
1,"Wow, no.","For a rugged title such as Pyromania, the music is pretty much the water that douses it out.By the way, how are Rick Allen's rudiments coming along? I'm sure those rolls are a major hurdle, right Rick? ""Def"" indeed; wise up people."
4,"Deluxe edition, a must for fans!","Packaging of this release is great, disc 2 Live-L.A. Forum 1983 is a nice bonus, as for the remastering job, I still prefer my MFSL Gold cd, but this version comes in 2nd. A good addition for your collection"
4,"Pyromania, Excellent !",Pyromania is excellent! This was their best CD before Hysteria. The vocals were great and guitar riffs also great. I would recommend this CD to anyone that is just started to get into Def Leppard.
2,STICK TO THEIR TWO FIRST ALBUNS !,"Because tehy are much better than this PYROMANIA, who marked the new ""phase' for Leppard... The drums sound here is annoying, the lyrics are a joke. There's no way you can compare this with HIGH N DRY !"
3,Maybe not for me.,"Okay so I didn't hate this show, but I definitely expected more action. To me it was just a bunch of school girls playing with sticks. Even in real life Kendo is a respectable sport, but in this show it is a farce. Yes the characters learn valuable lessons, but it seems as though they were just thrown in. As far as a comedy goes, this show was funny and I liked the wide variety of character types, but I wish that it hadn't been based from tournament to tournament. The lack of deep story and more action was just not what I was expecting.Overall its not a bad anime if you are looking for a laid back, cute, funny, HS girl drama series."
3,Quite good.,"The Dream of the Blue Turtles is a pretty enjoyable album. The album's musicianship, songwriting, and production are good. All of the tunes are quite adventurous. My favorite songs are ""Fortress Around Your Heart,"" ""Russians,"" and ""Children's Crusade."" The rest of the tracks are also listenable. Sting does a good job with the vocals throughout. Worth a listen."
4,Excellent keyboard,"My Dell keyboard had a sticking key, so I got this one. It has a MUCH better feel than the Dell keyboard. It is very quiet (and I was surprised by one reviewer's complaint that it was noisy).The only complaint I have is with the feet that raise up the rear of the keyboard. They are shorter than I would wish. But if your chair is at the proper height, this should be no problem."
4,santa fe cologne,"It doesn't smell quite like I remember from several years ago, but maybe it's my memory that's lacking. It does have a nice manly scent and I like it on my husband."
4,Rhyming tour,"This is a guided tour of a typical city. The book takes us to visit a statue, an art museum, and a mountain, among many other sights. The text is all presented in rhymes, and the pictures are quite well done. (...)"
4,Rhyming tour,"This is a guided tour of a typical city. The book takes us to visit a statue, an art museum, and a mountain, among many other sights. The text is all presented in rhymes, and the pictures are quite well done. The book has about 750 words."
5,Oldie but GOODIE!,"I have had this VHS tape for years but dug it out the other day when the weather made walking inadvisable. I've kept my New Year's Resolution to, at age 55, finally get radically healthy, and have lost over 50 pounds so far not dieting, but getting healthy. I had burned this to a DVD and began working out every day with it. It is wonderful for beginners like me that were obese and now working their way down the scale. Thank you, Stormie!"
2,"Fun toy, but could be much better","This is a fun toy. The way the balloons fly around is fun to watch and the sound they make is just hilarious, especially for young kids. BUT the pump broke within the first 10 fills. We superglued it back together and it lasted another 5 fills or so. Also, maybe it's just us or just the pump we received as no one else has mentioned it, but we found the pump required ALOT of strength to fill the balloons. So much so that it was much easier to fill them with our mouths. No way our daughter could do it on her own.Like others, we had issues with some of the balloons: several had holes and could never be filled, others tore easily on their first flight around the room. But there were many good balloons in the bunch too.If the pump were easier to use and didn't break so readily, this could easily be played with for hours at a time. As it stands, we're tired after 10 minutes or so. I can't give it more than 2 stars."
5,A Diamond In The Rough,"This album was my earliest childhood memory of music. The cuts sparkle with an energy I've just never heard on the studio versions, especially Solitary Man, Cherry Cherry and Cracklin' Rose. Plus, you haven't got feelings if the tale of the old man on Morningside doesn't get to you. A definite must for a varied CD collection"
4,An Entertaining DVD,This is a very good story. The acting is very good and the story is excellent. I spend every evening watching DVDs because television has deteriorated so badly. PBS has the only decent programming. I can still find entertaining movies and on DVD they are more economical then going to the movies.This movie is very entertaining.
5,Worth multiple viewings,"I really enjoyed this movie, so much that I saw it again the next day. The film did a good job of showing the daily hustle of life as a criminal defense attorney and the bit players that all profit off of the cases. Terrific acting, cracking good script, realistic dialogue, and a good suspenseful story. The directors pacing and visual look of the film kept my attention throughout the movie. I can't say much more as it is really easy to ruin this movie by revealing the details."
3,It's decent.,"Ok plot. MM is the same, as usual. Ending is lame. Wouldn't bother watching again, and doubt I'd recommend. Meh."
3,It's okay,It didn't keep my attention. I watched it over three days a little at a time but finally finished it.Disappointing because of the actors it had in it thought it would be better.
2,NOT AS GOOD AS BOOK,I read the book first and liked it very much so ordered the movie to watch. The acting was not very good and there was so much more to the written version. Don't waste your money on movie.
4,Terrific,This movie gives you a new perspective of practicing law and it was really a good Matthew moment to see him work.
4,Fantastic Movie - Well worth watching,"Great movie that is fantastically written and well executed.i have to say I'm not normally a fan of Matthew McConaughey, so I had my doubts. But he was great. Illustrates a lot of the issues (And some positives) of our justice system. Has a great combination of action, humor, and is never boring. Can't recommend it enough."
3,The Lincoln Lawyer,"Rather indifferent towards this movie. The plot progression was a little jagged and I thought that Ryan Phillipe's acting was less than enthralling. It was entertaining, but not nearly as much as a thriller as I was expecting. Matthew McConaughey gave a good performance but overall I was unimpressed."
3,"Highly Improbable, but Still Interesting -","Matthew McConaughey (Mickey Haller) stars as a defense attorney, representing low-life clients for murder, drugs, assault, prostitution, etc. He thinks he's hit the jackpot with a rich new client, but then finds out he's been ensnared - the client actually is a vicious killer who asked for Haller. The rationale for picking Haller is too complicated to easily explain, as well as highly improbable. Regardless, Haller ends up as a suspect in the murder of his own investigator (actually done by his client's mother). To escape the trap, Haller engineers a complex double-cross that's even more complex and improbable."
4,Recommended,Very good story with a twist that surprise me. Matthew McConaughey did a better than average job in this role. Very good entertainment with no message. Just fun to watch.
4,Darned good movie,"I have one technical quibble. When you visit, as a lawyer, a client in the Los Angeles County Jail, you do not get a visit in a private room where you can hug your client. Most of the time you are talking on a telphone through a glass window and if you are lucky you get a semi-private booth where you talk through a wire screen and all the other inmates and attorneys in the vicinity can hear everything you say. You never get to touch your client. The deputies are so freaked out that you might pass drugs or a weapon. But let's write that off to dramatic license. This is a good movie and highly recommended."
3,The usual courtroom drama,"The courtroom dialogue is, at least, almost realistic, because the movie script was based on a mystery novel by an LA writer who once covered courts in LA and Florida, so he knows his stuff. I had to pause the movie half a dozen times, though, to get through it. There's not much tension or suspense. It's got the whiff of a TV movie about it. The gimmick of having the lawyer ride around in his chauffeured 1987 Lincoln wasn't enough to make me care about the characters here, despite a somewhat big name cast. You can only do so much with thin material. And the central idea, to free a wrongly imprisoned man, gets obscured by the main action revolving around a lightweight performance by Ryan Phillipe as the bad guy rapist/killer. This is okay, but it's not top drawer."
3,Seriously Overated,"There's not much point in a describing the film since there's plenty of reviews here, so I'll just say I found the film seriously over rated.Most of the actors mumbled there lines so much that we had to stop and go back and see if we could figure out what they were saying, and most of the time, we couldn't. William Macy was a great support for McConaughey but once gone the film fell flat. With few exceptions, there was a consistent lack of emotional connection, even Marisa Tomei, whose always good seemed flat. The story might have been interesting in another, more accomplished, director's hands. Too bad. Much to do about nothing."
3,As Smooth a Ride as a Lincoln,"Nothing sophisticated abut this court room thriller. Matthew McConaughey as Mickey Haller is the protagonist Lawyer going about business from the back seat of his Lincoln. The cool number plate ""NTGUILTY"" even draws attention from the bikies. The movie is a romp and really does not require being taken seriously. Just a fun movie set in LA with the feel of a tv pilot. However, what does set the movie apart from your average tv night is the stellar cast not only the lead but support from Marisa Tomei as the ex Margaret McPherson and William H. Macy as the shoe investigator Frank Levin. if you have a rainy weekend and require to kill time, this is the ideal movie with the odd twist and turn. Don't take popcorn and expect a smooth ride through some parts of LA which have you wondering ""where is that ?"""
2,Star power can't carry it,"I am a huge Michael Connelly fan - esp. Haller stories - but this movie, despite the great cast just didn't carry the story. McConaughey is not the right guy for Mickey. Close but does not do the book any favors. If you haven't read the books, go ahead, it'll be fine. If you have, oof."
1,Ridiculous!,I didn't realize that when I purchased this that it would be coming from the UK making it unreadable by DVD players in the US! Money down the drain!
2,Adam and Steve,"This movie definitely had some amusing scenes, but overall it did not live up to my expectations. I think this is a case where I had heard too much hype about the movie before viewing it."
3,Missed opportunity,"This film could have very well succeeded as a charming romantic gay comedy but it tries to go in so many directions that it winds up being a disappointment. It starts out along the lines of a John Waters film but the crude bathroom humor is so disgusting that many viewers may not be able to continue with it. Many of the gay bashing jokes fall flat and Parker Posey is wasted here and her character (a really bad stand-up comic) is painful to watch. On the other hand, half of the film is very enjoyable. It finally gets on track in the second half, but by that time it is just too late to make ammends. The two lead actors are good and most of the supporting actors are great - Sally Kirkland is very funny in a cameo and the ""family"" scenes are pretty funny. Better planning and editing could have resulted in a better film."
2,Better Description Needed,"This may be an excellent book, historically speaking, but not for actual usage. There are no pictures and many of the entries state (no sample)...so how do they know what they are writing about? Should be a better description right up front on this book. Nearly $17 for a VERY thin paperback that one cannot even use for an herbal reference - not impressed."
5,"Old ""skool"" Kung Fu!!","Another decent release from the Eastern Heros collection,,,this flick is certainly a BEST KEPT SECRET! I though the 7 commandment of Kung Fu is one of the most impressive flicks using the mantis fist. Definately one of of Li Min ( Mystery Of Chess Boxing,,Drunking Arts and Crippled Fist, 7 Grandmasters ,World of Drunken Master! This guy is equally surperb in this one,,,,,,,,,,be assured you 're in for a treat!!"
3,Shabby but worth the price,"I got this DVD because I had heard that Pluto Nash was the biggest money loser of all time. Plus I wanted to have a copy of what's considered to be the worst movie ever. The movie was no disappointment in that respect. You can see how much money they spent and how it just didn't work. Like a train wreck, you have to watch to see how dumb this movie gets. I'm glad I got it and I'm glad I paid less than $4 for it! The box was a little shabby as it was a former rental piece but for the price, it was worth it. The movie was 2 stars and the box was 3 stars, while the price was 4 stars."
2,A true B movie,"*The Adventures of Pluto Nash* was an adequate way to pass some time, but hardly gripping. The humor was forced, the plot clichéd, and the acting tepid. So as not to sound completely negative, I admit that there are some genuinely entertaining moments and a surprise at the end, but the overall effect is rather flat.The scenery is pretty and John Cleese puts in a charming cameo; that's about all I can say is right with it. Not that there's much wrong, either, but rather it's a mediocre show with some glitz on top. See it if the mood takes you, but wait until you can rent it or (better yet) borrow it for free from a public library."
5,"HGB was even wiser than we thought, and still plenty funny","I well remember when this book came out and caused an instant sensation and plentiful moral outrage. It was a guilty read. But also a wise, intelligent and savvy piece of work, as well as being hilarious. I think a lot of us back then thought Helen Gurley Brown was a real talent and were not surprised when she became editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan and presto chango made it the hottest magazine in the world (and a bible on college campuses). Now, in retrospect, after all these years, I'm thinking Mrs. Brown was even more talented than we knew and certainly a visionary. Her advice, which seemed so outrageous then, is above all practical and now seems totally reasonable. I own every book she's ever written and can tell you she is incapable of writing anything dull or dumb. If you don't know this classic, get it, you'll love it and it even has recipes!"
5,Great Classroom Advice!,"I think the place where teachers often get stuck is for new ideas to keep both themselves and their students engaged. Mr. Charnock's book does a great job providing tons of ideas for activities, writing prompts and the like sure to engage almost any student. Mr. Charnock has been differentiating instruction for his students long before it became a buzz word, and if you want a straight forward book with practical, classroom ideas, this is it."
4,Pearl tablecloth round 70 inch diameter checkerboard pattern,"Appears well made for cost. not overly heavy/thick, but not 'cheap' and thin either.I have the antiquey white or pearl color because there wasnt the same backorder wait as with some other colors. I have it thrown over a < 48"" dia. table and it, of course, hangs a bit long all around.dont use that table much so the tablecloth hasnt been tested yet with regard to stains, or washing/ironing.summary: i was having a hard time finding round tablecloths in this price range so i am pleased with it."
5,Inspiring and Practical,"I can not tell you how important it is for every new (and experienced) writer to obtain - and read - this book. Written in an extremely readable style and full of practical, meaningful exercises, this book is different from every other writing book out there. Buy it first and read it often."
2,"Stop with the so called, ""Inspirational Stuff""","Not only outdated, this book is impracticable, condescending, and pedantic. Unless you need inspiration, spirituality, and out-dated advice, I would suggest you spend your money on more practical writing guides. Just my opinion...<as she trades her edition into the booktrader....> Good luck, all!"
4,Love Stephen Hunter,I have read just about every Stephen Hunter book available and Second Saladin doesnot disappoint. This book succeeds in creating wonderful mental visualization
4,Oddly packaged,"This product works just fine, but came oddly packaged....well not really packaged at all. It came in just a regular Amazon box, not shrink-wrapped, no product labels, no instructions. You'd never know what it was if you hadn't ordered it yourself. So, I'll tell you what I learned the hard way...insert the Rody feet in the base BEFORE you inflate the Rody."
3,"Good, but not for picnic's or camping!","We decided to try this for a camping set & since there were no measurements listed, all we could do was try. A very big set!! Simple, durable set for serious back yard cooking. Too big, heavy and complex for picnic's or camping! Could be perfect for a chef-at-heart. If only it was smaller & simpler, it could be great!"
1,You've got to be kidding me,"Just wanted to provide a reality check for all the gushing reviews here. This record is a professional, slick, soulless and generic slab of product. The singer has that same obnoxious sneering vocal attack of like a million 90s bands, wholly lacking in originality or personality. With all the inventive music coming out in 2004, why would you bother with this dated-sounding dreck. And what the heck did Producer Brendan O'Brien (who recently worked with Springsteen) see in these guys."
5,LIVE AT THE APOLLO,"THIS IS ONE GREAT LIVE ALBUM. IN FACT, IT IS ONE OF THE FIRST LIVE ALBUMS EVER PRODUCED (BY JAMES BROWN WITH $5000 THAT HE BORROWED) THAT SOLD REALLY WELL. IT REALLY GIVES YOU A FEEL FOR THE LIVE ROAD SHOW OF JAMES BROWN AND THE FAMOUS FLAMES. IF YOU LOVE R&B, SOUL OR BLUES, YOU WILL LOVE THIS ALBUM. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT CLAIMS THAT THIS IS THE GREATEST LIVE ALBUM EVER, THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT ONES I CAN THINK OF, BUT IS ONE GREAT RECORDIING. THIS CD ALSO LINCLUDES FOUR BONUS TRACKS AS WELL."
3,Really informative and enlightening book - good read!,"Dave Pallone did something in baseball that, to my knowledge, no one else has ever done: he came out of the closet. Pallone wasn't a player, but rather an umpire. It cost him his job. Reading this book you will find that you are angered and uplifted. Pallone did not deserve the treatment he received from baseball. Pallone's treatment will be the reason that any others in baseball who are gay, remain in the closet. After all, we can't have anyone who is in team athletics acting in a non-acceptable manner... Funny isn't it that drugs, illegitimate children, murders, assaults, etc. are all acceptable behavior by professional sports, but homosexuality isn't.This book will provide you with an insight into something that is rarely spoken about. It isn't great literature, but then it isn't supposed to be. It is a biography of a person during a specific time. I recommend this book."
2,Where is the Beef,"I purchased this book for a J++ class. I needed information and examples on referencing elements in an array containing a structure. On page 196, there is a very good example of an array with multiple elements-- but the author never showed how to define nor reference the elements in the array-- instead using this example- the author showed a single element array structure, Where's the beef. Soooo- its to the local bookstore for a real book on J++."
4,Looking for more,"After reading Carlotta's Secret, I was definitely hungry for more. I can see where her secret will definitely make for more exciting adventures! Pat has a way of making her characters come to life. I'm sure that that Carlotta and the Webster Street gang will become a favorite for kids everywhere. I will enjoy reading it to my son when he's older. Here's to the next adventure!"
5,New Songs!,"If you really listen to this CD/Album (in the old days), there are some hidden gems! I still remember the news about Keith Moon and wondering what are the Who going to do? They have a great new album out and nodrummer.New Song, Guitar & Pen, Trick of the Light and Music Must Change are allgreat, along with the John Entwistle's songs!Pick it up you won't be disappointed!!!"
2,Four Canadian Highwaymen,This book's title leads you into it however the book itself is not well written or true to the title. I found it a slow and tedious read and would not reccomend it unless you are desparate.
2,Not one that I will adopt,"I have been using Touch for Women for the Longest and it is my signature perfume. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for this one. I assumed that since the one for women was so good this one would also be, I WAS DEAD WRONG. I will not buy this perfume a second time"
3,Training tips,I have purchased this book after adopting an Akita.The book states not to adopt an older Akita like I did.I do not agree. I have a great 2yr old Akita that I adopted from my local animal shelter.This book does have some great information until it comes to training.I would suggest a different book if training is what your looking for.
4,excellent,"Grant & Dunne are perfect for this script. They both give an outstanding performance, which places the viewer right into the parts of the players. It's a movie you'll find yourself yourself watching more than once."
4,A helluva good story,"I'm not really sure what the literary significance of this novel might be, but it sure held my interest through all kinds of weird scenes and characters. I finished the book feeling that I knew the central character and understood something about this sprawling country of ours that I did't already know. Highly recommended."
5,The laughter keeps on coming...,"Much like the first season, this season is filled with stereotypes and hilarious jokes. You may learna little history (I wouldn't recommend using much of it in class, though), but you will certainly be amused. More countries are introduced, and, again, the accents in the dub are stupendously stereotypical! Even better than the first season!! I simply cannot wait for the third season!!!"
3,Misleading Pictures,"While I did get the dvd that I wanted. I thought that I was going to be getting the bandanas as well because of one of the pictures. If those things aren't included, then that picture needs to be removed. The series is really funny, but its not for those who are easily offended. Japan's and China's voices still kinda bother me a little."
2,Boring,"Because I'm the same age as the director, I can say that this film was marketed directly for me and folks in my generation. I appreciated the nostalgia, but: my gosh this film is SLOW to develop, way slower than the films to which it plays homage. This will bore 14 year olds to death. This 38 year old feel asleep in one part. It's a pretty film, and the child actors are VERY good, but the story is sort-of lame, and the ending pretty much a let down. Folks are rating this film highly because they WANT to like it, but own it's own merits, it's really kind of boring and too slow paced to really capture the magic of, say, ET or the GOONIES. Meh."
2,Really a teen movie...,"This movie was not advertised as such, but was really a teen movie. I felt like I was watching a Disney horror flick. It had some scary parts, but it was clearly geared towards teens, so was a disappointment overall."
3,Cloverfield meets The Goonies,"This is truly the love-child of J.J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg. It is half-Cloverfield, half ""The Goonies"". Too bad that between the two of them they couldn't think of anything original to do. On the upside, lots of noisy things blow up. It is not bad American cinema; in fact, it's quite good, in the same way that a Big Mac is good American cuisine."
1,"Ridiculous, Boring -","Watched this because it was produced by Spielberg. Have found that this is not a good way to select movies - too many losers such as this one (also '1941,' 'War Horse,' and War of the Worlds'). A '60 Minutes' interview with Spielberg suggested the reason - turns out Spielberg had problems in his relationship with his father, and was overly caring for his mother (had left his father for another man).Regardless, the 'plot' here involved a group of friends making a super 8 movie who witness a train crash while filming at night. Inexplicable events begin to take place in town (dogs and people disappear), their biology teacher is somehow involved, and the Air Force imposes an informal martial law control. Too much sci-fi silliness ruins even the chance of this movie being a charming story of teen-age relationships."
5,Great Movie. Classic Spielberg.,"This is classic Steven Spielberg in action. Although he didn't direct it, he may as well have. He did produce it and it shows. It's got the essence of early 80's films like ""Goonies"", ""Batteries Not Included"" and ""E.T."" There is a spectacular action sequence involving a train and a bunch of kids who seem to be on to the fact that there is a lot more going on in the town they're living in than any of the adults are aware of. A group of kids set out to shoot a little horror film so that they can submit it to a Film Festival, but they end up capturing more than they bargained for setting them up on a fast paced thrill ride that turns their town upside down. Some intense moments that may be too much for young kids, but for the rest of the family this is a joy."
3,Super 8 Blunder,"This movie makes you think especially if you like continuity problems. I expected perfection from Abrams and Spielberg. You can sit back, like in Mystery Science Theater 3000, and criticize for a couple of hours with little rest. If these numerous minor problems are overlooked it is enjoyable. Be forewarned, the audio is very low but the action scenes are extremely loud so be prepared."
3,"a good rental, no need to watch it again.","The review from Amazon.com was spot on. The movie tries to hard to seem like it was filmed in 1979, put a filter over the camera lens for goodness sake enough with the glare. The kids in the film do a good job of acting however the generic ""fat kid"" gets annoying after a while. The story is pretty basic, alien escapes train wreck and tries to leave earth. Don't expect to see much of the alien creature, i would say 5 minutes of screen time tops, but the overall special effects are great and are done by Spielberg buddy ILM. If you want to watch a movie that makes you think of late 70's early 80's sci-fi then this is the movie for you."
3,"First hour was great, then it seemed I was watching ET.",It seemed as though the formula for some great films from my past replaced the film half way through the film leaving me with an empty feeling at the films conclusion.
4,Genuinely Entertaining,"I've read bad things about Super 8. After watching it, I don't really understand what some peoples' issue is with it. There was an almost constant smile on my face. The characters were generally likable, the action sequences were well done (though admittedly, the train crash scene probably brought a tear to Michael Bay's eye), the story was simple yet effective, the production values were off the charts. Will this movie be heralded in the future as a classic like, perhaps, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, or E.T.? No. But it's still a great movie, and a lot of fun to watch. J.J. Abrams is quickly becoming one of my favorite modern Science Fiction directors."
5,Pure excitement!,"Some kids in a small Ohio town are filming a movie when they witness a train crash. Mysterious things begin to happen around town and the kids are right in the middle of all the occurrences. This is a very exciting science fiction drama that is sort of a cross between E.T. and Close Encounters. The acting, the visuals and the sound effects here are all top notch, and there is constant excitement throughout. The movie can be a little intense at times, so it may not be for children. If you are looking for pure escapism, and a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this is the one."
4,lost 1.1,if u loved lost then this will bring back a lot of memories especially the soundtrack and the way the story unfolds. jj abrams does a fantastic job with the movie and charcters. i cant wait for his next release. definitely recommend this movie to all jj fans. You wont be disappointed. maybe someday he will make a movie for lost.
2,Like cloverfield with kids..,"This is not a good movie, it's meant for kids but surprisingly given the pg13 cert. because of profanity and coarse language spoken by the child actors. It's shocking to hear that fat movie director character in this film bossing the other ones who are smaller and thinner than him around and that's why I would not recommend it to parents for a Sunday afternoon viewing with their kids. Very similar to cloverfield except the main characters are all tweenagers. Maybe it was intended as a prequel to cloverfield. No ones noticed it but me.. Yeah I think I'm the only one who does. mr Abrams must stop all this friends stumbling upon aliens type of idea.. It just doesn't work anymore. Don't buy the movie, rent it instead. Bluray pict quality 5/5, audio quality 4/5"
1,slow action & 90% of the movie was too dark...??,the movie was slow to action & 90% of the movie was too dark so you really cant see whats happening. wasup with that? then it was almost predictable but boring...please dont waist $10 like i did. kids even lost interest and fell asleep lol
2,super 8,after viewing super 8 I thought the action footage was great. after reading the reviews I can see why the country is in such a mess. you get all these good reviews and not once in the good reviews do I see anyone comment on the rude and nasty behavior of these 12 year old kids. Im 65 and even today i would not treat anyone like these kids did in the movie. the script writers think that this is funny to treat other friends this way is a joke. i would not recommend this movie for anyone under 18 years of age. come on America clean up your act
1,Boring story that's full of cursing kids!,"Certainly not a family movie. The story was completely boring and I could not wait till it was over. There was a ton of needless cursing, especially by the children, and an F bomb, for what reason I have no idea other than more Hollywood brain washing to promote the cause that cursing is acceptable. Thank goodness I rented it for free with a promotion through Redbox!"
1,A great movie for kids? Really?,"For parents and kids like us who find it offensive, this film is loaded with swearing. It hardly ever lets up. My husband and I don't recall that 2 of the words were even in use in 1979. I didn't like that 3 of the 4 helpful adults in this movie used drugs or alcohol. The special effects are great. I think the story is weak and as a sci-fi fan I would have liked more of the ""science"" explained and more alien involvement other than simply throwing junk straight up in the air for most of the movie. There is very little humor although one boy has perfect timing remarking on methods of suicide. (You would have to hear him, it's not as bad as it sounds.) All the kids did a pretty good job acting as their quirky characters. But if you find bad language offensive, I'd skip this one. Our son left the room halfway through. It was a Spielberg film and I wanted so much for it to get better, but I should have followed his example."
1,One of the worst films of 2011,Steven Spielberg has lost his touch for a long time now. This is a terrible film. The actors (kids) were very good. This is one of those films that rarely shows you anything and use darkness to hide things instead of spending the money to show you. I absolutely think this is one of the worst films of the year. Please do not buy this.
2,Not what I expected,"I'm not sure why this movie received such amazing reviews. The story was okay, but the pacing and acting made it difficult to watch. My husband fell asleep about 30 minutes into it, and he wasn't even tired. I'm not sure what the price is now, but I would recommend waiting until it hits $.99 or free before I would recommend renting it. Then again, I often suggest that everyone watch the blockbusters, if for no other reason than to improve future Trivial Pursuit games."
3,Missing some logic,"We never once find out what those weird white cubes are, even though this whole sci-fi film is based on that mystery. The finale goes rather unexplained, as well, when the typical space monster somehow manages to morph a bunch of earthly metal junk into a space ship in a matter of seconds. Say what? Prior to those letdowns, this modern-day Speilberg production features his usual band of cute kids getting into trouble, but avoiding anything really bad happening to them because of their wide-eyed innocence. If you enjoy that formula, you will like this otherwise high quality production. Just don't expect any logic."
2,Boring,"I went into this movie not knowing anything about what it was about. I came out of this moving still unsure of what it was about, save that they took almost two hours to tell a 5 minute story. The effects were definitely nice, but the movie was too dark for me to watch comfortably. I felt like I was missing out because so much was hidden from view in darkness; I spent almost the entire movie wondering what was going on and why. Disappointed."
1,Boring!!!!,Very Boring movie.Really did not like it. It was good at first then it just went sour after about 20 minutes.Hated It!
1,think Cloverfield,great preview..lousy movie. It really did seem like a bunch of kids made this movie. Just really bad plot & bad acting.
2,Great beginning,I had heard that the reviews for this movie were good and so I decided to give this one a try. The cast were excellent at the start of this movie. The action scenes were the best I have watched in a very long time. It kept my interest until near the end of the movie and it simply fell flat very quickly - the ending made me angry and felt the J J Abrams has finally lost it - not his best at all.
2,Ok movie with a lose plot,This Movie in my View is a B flick. They might have put a lot of money into CGI to make it work but the plot really didn't work all that well. If you see a ton of movies this might be a good one to see once but be smart and rent it and not buy the movie.ThanksRobert
3,traditional Speilberg fare,"It won't disappoint. Captures the magic,but could have used better lighting to expose and dwell on the creature longer. After all it was a high dollar production."
5,Not your traditional E.T.,"I just rented this last night and it has everything a movie needs to be successful. It's exciting, touching,and thought provoking. It basically asks,""What would happen if the sweet little E.T. of 1982 had been bigger, captured, held prisoner for 20+ years abused and then gets lose?""As an audience we are first scared with the the abundance of confusion and at the end we are angry at the inhumane humans and then deeply touched by the simple love of family that finally is realized.This movie is great for all age levels but if there are family members younger than 8, Mom or Dad should be there as support because it's got some graphic scenes."
4,"Good pace and ""production value"" inuendo.","A pleasant and entertaining surprise. Some stuff within the script is thinly stretched, but the kids faces remind you of the genre, and allows you to accept the soft spots."
4,great little movie,"these movie was a great little story but I think it didn't have chance with the big monry movie, but i enjoy it."
3,Disappointed,"This movie is a combination of E.T,Close encounters of the third kind and independence day all tricked out with with modern day effects.Lack substance and is fairly predictable.A one time watcher not a keeper.Better of renting."
4,"Great, Honest Missionary Story","This was a great book about the Lemke family and their lives in the Ukraine. As a missionary in training, I appreciated the honesty Janice wrote with in recounting her years in the Ukraine. Missionary stories are usually told as if missionary work was the greatest thing ever. But the author was honest- missionary work is HARD.I also appreciated the emphasis the missionaries put on learning the language and culture of the people they were working with. They were patient with the people, and they respected the already existing (but struggling) church. This is to be commended. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in missions, especially those interested in living overseas."
4,Finding His Feet . . .,"While Mick Jagger was busy making lousy records and even lousier movies during the Stones' late 80s' breakup, Keith Richards made this album with a group he called The X-Pensive Winos. Neither Stone would enjoy the commercial success they enjoyed in the band, but Keith won the critical battle easily. This album, featuring the Winos as well as guest stars like Bootsy Collins and Bernie Worrell, went back to the roots of what the Stones were all about, great rock and roll songs with R&B leanings. Check out the wonderful ""Locked Away"" and the incredible duet with Sara Dash, ""Make No Mistake"". There's rockabilly on ""I could Have Stood You Up"", a little funk on ""Big Enough"" and plenty of attitude on ""Whip It Up"" and ""Take It So Hard"". This album was a great return to ""The Human Riff's"" roots and a statement on just who the talent is in the Jagger-Richards partnership."
2,"Keef is a guitar slinger, maybe a vocalist but the way this is mixed you never know.","While there are so many anthem guitar riffs from Keith we all need to tip our hats to, his journeys into rock records where he is the vocalist, no hat tipping needed.I am sure he means well and there are stellar sounding tracks, I'd bet there isn't a linguist or interpriter amongst us that can decipher what Keith is wailing, crying and growling about. Then to make matters worse, for some reason his vocal lines are mixed well below the level of the surrounding music, yes this hides flaws but I shouldn't have to borrow Charlie Watts’s hearing aid to hear Keith’s lyrics.I know, it's only rock and roll, but I do like it and it's hard to fully appreciate a work you can't access. So download the lyrics and read along, or simply buy a Stones album where you still stand a chance of understanding 85% of Mick’s golden throat offerings."
4,Rivals the better Stones albums,"Upon it's release, Guitar Player magazine deemed 'Talk Is Cheap' as ""the best Rolling Stones album in 17 years."" They weren't far off the mark in their assessment. Compared to many Stones records of the seventies and eighties, the stuff on 'Talk Is Cheap' compares quite favorably. On his own, Keith shows us just what an important part of the Stones he's been all these years. As opposed to 'Slick Mick,' Keith has maintained more of a roots rock and roll influence and certainly more of an edge. Admittedly, he's not one of the better vocalists I've heard. But in most cases, the integrity, guitar hooks, and attitude of the songs more than make up for his vocal deficiencies. When you include his backing band in the evaluation, that puts 'Talk Is Cheap' well over the top as a worthwhile addition to one's collection."
5,Great products,"Great products, fast shipping, and cheap price, I would definitely purchase from this seller again, in the future!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11"
1,thriftique Warehouse junk,"This book was in very poor shape and falling apart it cannot be used for the study of christian history as you turn the page they are falling apart .A note inside said thank you for your order please leave feedback if you are happy well I am not happy. I am not a collector of history I am a student at the Seminary and can not use this book for study due to the binding falling apart and the fear to turn the pages as they will come unbound from the book. So I was charged 16.95 for nothing that I can use.I will never buy from this dealer again and will advise others to not buy from them this book was to have been in good shape I am sorry falling apart is not good shape.This book came from Thriftique warehouse 40 carbon place , Jersy City, NJ 07305"
3,Good General Overview of Catholic History,"This is an orthodox book. There is one by Bokenkotter that is heterodox, and should only be read if one really knows the true Catholic faith. Bokenkotter pushes an agenda rather than scholarship.The only reason I give only 3 stars is that Laux's original book ended before the reign of Pius XII, and someone else took over after that. That later history is not as detailed, in my opinion.Gerald R. Schmidt, author ofThe Strange Life of Walenty Karnowski: The Rabbi's Illegitimate Grandson"
5,Don't Be Scared,"Mr.Miller is a phenomenal thinker! His observations are compelling and in-depth. Although you may think the subject matter is intimidating, he explains is all with incredible clarity. This book taught me a great deal - the information was accessable to the ""non-scientist"", and it really changed the way I look at the world. THANK YOU ARTHUR MILLER BRAVO!!!"
1,Brow Gain,"When I received the Brow Gain, I was shocked at the small size the Brow Gain. I had just spent $45.00 on this product that is at least one half the size of a mascara. When I applied the Brow Gain, I noticed that the wand seemed almost dry, but I continued to use the product until it became bone dry (which was about two weeks later). I email and phoned the company with my dissatisfaction, but no one ever got back to me. The instructions said you would need to use the product for five months before you would see any results. Maybe Paris Hilton can afford this product, but I certainly cannot. In my opion, it was a waste of money!!!"
1,Huge Dissappointment,I'm a cancer survivor who lost most of my eyebrows during my chemotherapy treatment. I thought this product would be the answer I'd been searching for but after using it for over a month I see no new growth. This was not only a waste of money but it got my hopes up for nothing.
1,very expensive and doesn't work,"I have had very sparse brows for years. I stumbled upon this product and was hopeful that I would see even a small difference in my brows. Unfortunately, after two months of applying this every night I saw no increase in growth. My brows looked exactly the same after I used it for all this time.I was completely disappointed and wasted a great deal of money."
4,Old skool new again!,Great cd! I was too young to buy it when first released. Very good songs for kids that age. A must buy!
2,"Mediocre, but captivating translation","I had never read any of Hughes work, but as a translation of Greek text, it was dificult to place it in an ancient time. The captivating: It was a fast, and entertaining read, with a few lines I enjoyed. The mediocre: If you can handle words like ""atoms"" and ""nelson hold"" in your Greek translations, then go for it. I am not sorry I read it, but it could have been better. It is a tale of struggle in life, love, and death... so take what you can learn fom and shrug the rest off."
4,Pet Stages Dome Pull,"My parakeet loves this toy, even though it is much bigger than her, size was not an issue."
1,Buyer Beware,"Please be aware that this is NOT a DVD, despite what the title indicates. It is a VHS tape. The rating is not a review of the product itself. It's a rating of Amazon which has been made aware of the error but has not corrected the title yet. I caught the error in time to cancel the order before it was shipped, but others may not be as lucky. I'm still hoping Amazon will carry the DVD version someday. My understanding from other reviews is that it is great."
4,Robert Crays finest album,"In 1987 I went to see Eric Clapton and didnt know much about Robert Cray at the time. Cray came out to open for Eric Clapton.At the time Strong Persuader had just come out.Robert Cray played the entire album and a few songs from his previous album. I have to admit I enjoyed Robert Cray more than Clapton that night. Robert Cray has become one of the premire blues guitarists on the scene. His music at times has a jazz sound to it. His sound is very clean and refreshing to listen to.This CD is chocked full of his best songs.Smoking Gun is probably his best known song and a great way to start an album. Robert Cray has a sound all his own on the guitar.Right Next Door(Because of Me) is another major hit of his.Cray mixes Jazz with Blues and together its a lethal combination that I thoroughly enjoy.Other songs of note on the CD are, Nothing But A Woman, Foul Play and a slow blues song I Wonder. This is worthy of any blues collection ................enjoy"
4,Daily Reading,I have found this daily reading book to be very close to what I was looking for. All the excerpts are from the Pali Canon whichis what I wanted. There are a couple of ways the book could be improved though.One thing that disappointed me was that rather than having the citation on the same page as the excerpt they aregrouped together in the back of the book.The other thing that is disappointing is that the editor chose to change some important words. Many of these discourses were spoken to the Bhikkhus by the Buddha. The editor leaves out words like Bhikkhu.Even though I would prefer that the original words were left in place this book is a good reference to point one toward the more scholarly translations.
3,Sentence structure detracts from content,"I use this as part of my morning devotions. The translation is not good. Many sentences are poorly structured. Sometimes the language is impenetrable. I will stick with this for now, but eventually will look for something with better English."
2,does not protect your camera,"this neoprene case does not protect your camera well; also it does not have any place to carry en extra battery or a SD card reader (the outside pouch is so small that max 1 SD card can fit); moreover it does not have a shoulder or neck strap. do not buy this if you want to protect your camera, and plan to store the minimum accessories while you travel. however, on the other side it is just small enough to fit in your pocket - so may be good buy if you are looking forward to get a small pouch to keep the camera in pocket etc."
4,sweet case,"sweet case works great, but dont expect to store much else besides your camera and memory cards in this case.no cables or battery chargers will fit"
4,Fits like a glove...,"The S4/S10 cameras are a bit strange in shape, so its hard to find a case in your local store.... but this case fits the camera perfectly. It has a belt loop, but I also wish it had a shoulder strap. The front velcro pocket is very tiny, just enough room for a small lens cloth."
5,Fantastic Book for Collectors,"This is a great informative book , I learned a lot about the process of making paperweights and what to look for in terms of which ones have the most value. All in all, an outstanding book."
4,Great Chip Trays for CRAPS or Poker,"Fast shipping via UPS Ground(6 Total Days, less two days for weekend). Trays are made in CHINA. Each tray holds 5 columns of 20 chips each for a total of 100 chips. My 11.5 Gram weight, 39mm. diameter chips fit perfect in each column with 20 chips per column for a grand total of 100 chips per tray. You can flip over one unused tray and use it as a cover top for a filled up tray!! You can also stack filled trays, and then cover the top tray with an unused tray. Nice design/mold, and with 10 trays it will hold all of my 1000 professional chips. Would buy again for sure. Next buy, the Acrylic Carrier for 10 Trays at around $50."
4,Good tray....a little loose,"I bought these trays for use with the Venerati line of chips from Sidepot. They are a little loose, but not too bad."
3,"Not professional, but they hold chips.","I purchased both the Trademark poker chips and trays because I wanted them to fit perfectly. This is not my experience. Every color but black fits in the trays in rows of 20. Black fits 21.The trays only stack when full (100 chips in bottom tray), but even then they do not stack well.Really, the only reason to choose these over other trays is that they are cheap."
1,add to the confusion,"So I believe this is the THIRD different Tunnel Trance Force Volume 1. This is not the original, in case you were looking for that."
1,Not what it used to be.,"I guess I'm the only reviewer who actually bought the dvd set. I am a huge fan of the old series and I bought this new one hoping for more of the same, it had a TVMA rating so I had my hopes up. Turns out this dvd release is an extremely tamed down version of the show, it's a Funimation release after all. Remember watching DBZ on Cartoon Network and they would cut away any time someone was about to get punched and only show the reaction shot? Yeah, a lot of the same here. I am totally disappointed. Thanks to all the piracy websites out there I can't even find a thread of people talking about whether or not this is a censored release or if it was really animated without any ultraviolence.Anyway, if you want Guyver for what it used to be, skip this. If you're cool with the made for tv guyver, snatch it up. The dvd is still good for what it is, but it's not what it's supposed to be."
4,"Excellent, But Curious","This latest version of Guyver is truely a MAGNIFICANT work of anime. I enjoyed the revision of the story line. It does answer alot of questions I had before, but now my questions have been answered and explained somethings that I missed. The main music theme for The Guyver, Waiting For... by Yo Reiri, is HOT. I loved this song so much that I actually bought the soundtrack and play this song at least four times daily. But I wish the Japanesse writers would continue this version with an conclusional ending. I think its kind of crude to remake the Guyver,each time, only to add more details about the characters lives and not come forth with an ending. I have been a FAN of anime since 1990 and love every year of it, but recently each anime have been increasingly known to stop without a conclusion. Its beginning to get irritating. Although irritated, I will always LOVE anime and The Guyver."
5,Definitely a keeper!,This is the finest category romance I have ever read. The heroine is a beautiful young woman haunted by her sad childhood in foster homes. The hero is a workaholic businessman who meets her through their half-brother and becomes utterly enchanted with her. The story of how they overcome secrets from the past and their present fears is truly wonderful. You will love this book!
4,Good selection of powerful Classics,This CD is a good mix of some well-known classics (like Bach's Toccata and Fugue for organ) and lesser-known works (like Teixeira's Tibi Omnes Angeli and Dvorak's string quartet). This is definitely something to take with you on the road to keep you awake - most of the music on here is better played loud!
4,"Good phone, but instructions not user friendly",I bought this phone for my elderely parents. It seems to work fine but my father can't figure out how to use all the features because the instructions are definitly not user friendly. I don't have the time to really play with it. But they both love the speaker feature as they are a little deaf!!!I would say it's well worth the money and it doesn't take up too much space and it's attractive looking.
2,Just get it from a vending machine,"Sure it is great candy, but list price of over $1 per bar and actual price of about $.75 per bar? Just get one when you want one. Or just buy it anywhere else. I love Amazon, but I can't imagine they sell much of this."
4,Great debut from the Police,"I enjoy all the songs on this one except ""Born in the 50's"" and ""Be My Girl - Sally"". I like how the songs are so varied. You get reggae with ""So Lonely"" and ""Roxanne"", punkish sounds with ""Next To You"" and ""Truth Hits Everybody"" and even some jazzy chords with ""Hole In My Life"" Even on this first album you can tell these guys had a boat load of talent and Sting's songwriting was top notch."
3,pd 1-outland armour,"i only like 5 songs-nxt2u, solonely, roxane, cntstndlosin, trthhitsevbdy. there 1st lp revisted fur me. all i can say fer now."
5,Hugely helpful,I wish I had this book when I first started leaning kanji. Knowing the history of the characters makes it much easier to identify radicals and remember meanings.
2,Fair...not great,"There certainly is a lot of information in this book, and I found it occasionally useful, but as a study aid it failed me. It was easier to copy Japanese from textbooks onto notecards than study this book, and for looking up Japanese, a real dictionary is far superior."
4,no happy ending here,"Again, the orphans are shuttled off to their next guardian, Aunt Josephine whose fears are numerous, including Realtors, electricity and the telephone. She serves every meal cold because she's too scared to turn on the stove. She also gives grammar lessons to the children. Her fears somehow abate slightly when she meets Captain Sham (actually Count Olaf), and this proves to be her downfall. The orphans find themselves battling leeches in a boat on Lake Lachrymose, as well as struggling to elude Olaf yet again. To do so, they must take a perilous journey after first decoding a note left behind by their aunt."
2,Skip this audiobook,"The first two books are read by Tim Curry. He does a great job and does all the voices and some 'sound effects'. Lemony Snicket reads the rest of the series. He writes a good book but his performance is flat. Hopefully, Harpers will bring back Tim Curry. Or maybe Jim Dale to read. Until then, I hold out for better readers."
4,book,The book is very intresting.you will want to read all the books.the book is a very nice quest. it is about three children whos parents die in a house fire.the children go to other people.
1,Tyler Tucker says bad!,this book makes me sad a it is no good it is not a bit worht reading it is so scary that i was so scarwed afterword.If your name is Meghan Norris or Taylor White please do not read this book it is awful. This book was great!
4,A heart-thumper...a real thriller with lots of suspense,"Imagine yourself sitting on a most dreary dock, just a few feet above a deep, dark, titanic lake with human-thirsty leeches. Imagine yourself staying at your new home (which is holding onto dear life from a cliff, reaching for the water). Spooky, huh? This is the kind of life that the Baudilaire siblings go through. Read this book and see the horrible miseries these children go through."
1,What happened to Tim Curry?,"My daughter and I had listened to the first two audio books, ""The Bad Beginning"" and ""The Reptile Room"", both narrated by Tim Curry, so we were very disappointed by ""The Wide Room."" Tim Curry was a fabulous narrator, why did they not continue to use him? His voice has just the right quality of evil mischief to it, and as an actor he really brought the book to life. Often, the person who wrote the book is not the best person to read it and this is the case with Lemony Snicket. His whiney, lispy voice was so bad it was a distraction. Curry's fabulous, velvety voice oozed malice and delight and the loss of him was a loss to the quality of the story. Lemony Snicket narrating his own story is truly an ""Unfortunate Event!"""
5,A Very Fascinating Discovery for all ages!,This book is one of my favorite in the series. You will love this book as it is one of the most exciting ever written. Buy this wonderful novel today!
3,'Tis an uneasy Christmas viewing,"I remember watching this special on TV as a kid as I'm sure many of you did. I recall the songs being very catchy and memorable, along with the inclusion of Clement C. Moore's original tale. But there was something about it that bothered me. It's almost as though it intends to enforce a cynical tone about the existence of Santa Claus to younger viewers, uncharacteristic for the Rankin-Bass production team. Their adaptations of 'Rudolph' and 'Frosty', by comparison, respond more warmly to the chidhood innocence and wonder often associated with the Christmas season. That doesn't happen until towards the end, but it may leave some children questioning their faith in Santa. Is this appropriate viewing for a child under the age of eight?And what's with all the humans and mice having buck teeth? I think the otters in 'Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas' have better-looking buck teeth than the characters in this special do!"
1,The Worst Christmas Special,"This Christmas special is the dumbest I have ever seen. It has no recollection to the classic story. Also, the characters all have buck teeth! Even the mice. If you want to see a real Christmas special watch Emmet Otters Jug Band Christmas!"
5,twas the night before xmas-george gobel,great story line for children...not overplayed on t.v. looked forever to purchase. my older teens still love it! thanks amazon.com
5,Hazzah for lost 80's!!,"For those of us born in the late 70's and early 80's, this show is one of those that you will vaguely recall and feel all warm and fuzzy when you revisit it. It was shown for only a few years during those cartoon runs that the main channels would do on the nights leading up to the holidays. ABC (if I recall correctly) was the main broadcaster for this as well as ""A Claymation Christmas"", ""Charile Brown Christmas"", and ""Garfield's Christmas"". It's a collectors item for all of us who like trying to imitate those runs once a year. ^.^Done in traditional half dialogue, half song and dance of the time, the plot is intelligent and the virtues and integrity of the story are timeless. Particularly good for any families that have technologically tuned children under age 6."
5,Excellent - exactly what I wanted,I was very happy when I received my new sunglasses. I love Serengeti brands anyway and these are fantastic. The are ightweight and sturdy. I think the amber lense is the best for driving in the bright sun and even in foggy conditions.
2,a sales man's must read?,"This book I was told is a must read for all sales men. Well it really seems more like a book of stories about the authors sales experience. It doesn't tell you advice of how to sell, its really about the the ego of the author, the thing that I don't get is how this book is actually the sequel! I don't recommend this book, there plenty of other more helpful sales books out there."
4,Too funny to take seriously,"This book is indeed funny and occasionally insightful (the chapter on federal farm subsidies is a real eye-opener), but one shouldn't take it as a substitute for a serious analysis of the philosophical underpinnings of government. At the end of the book, O'Rourke concludes that ANY form government is morally wrong. What? That's not libertarianism, that's anarchism. Sorry PJ, but all forms of social order require some form of coercion to maintain themselves (I'm reminded of the quip, ""We tried to set up an anarchic commune but nobody would follow the rules."") Conservatives who feel that O'Rourke is on ""their side"" should also recognize that he not only has a low opinion of his government, but of his fellow Americans as well. He's a refugee from the sixties who never lost his contempt for America, he merely redesigned it to fit the changing political winds. All in all, however, I'm glad people like him are around, lest we take ourselves too seriously."
2,A lone humorist failing to be humorous,"I enjoy O'Rourke's essay-type writings, especially the more extravagant and bizarre ones, but did not find this book all that funny. In fact, I battled to finish it. American government should be an easy target for O'Rourke, but he never seems to get it together in this book. The only part of it which I found really funny was about the investigation into auto transmission cars squashing its owners against their garage doors. Otherwise it hardly raised a smile."
3,cleveer insights,"This book's commentary about politics and government are based on 20 year old events, yet remain true in today's world. the author's use of language is humourous, at times, aptly so. Someone considering reading this ought not be put off by its historical references."
2,Compaq Presario 2195US Notebook PC,Good work horse laptop... I initially had problems with this notebook and ran into a lot of red tape calling tec support in India. After 2-3 weeks of inconsistencies I finally called the Headquarters in the US and my problem was resolved ASAP. No problems since with the exception of a dead battery.
5,"Ties That Bind (Bound Hearts, Book 1)","Jaid Black and Lora Leigh are wonderful authors. All of their books a great. Well written, compelling and engrossing. You won't want the books to end."
1,Waste of Money,"I purchased this watch for my dad. He is 87 and recently got macular degeneration in his second eye. Because of this, he could no longer read the time on his regular watch. This watch is described as unisex and when it arrived I tried it on. The band was tight on me (a female). It was easy for me to set the time on both the hands and the speaker. I figured I could replace the band with a real men's band if necessary. I brought it to my dad in the nursing home and he was thrilled with it. He declined the offer for another band saying that this would probably stretch out with time. The voice could have been a little louder but if he put the watch to his ear he could hear the time. However, within three weeks the voice stopped working. The hands still work so I don't think it's the battery. And after reading the other reviews I see that they don't last. It's a great idea, but defective product."
4,Animal Pak vitamins,"it gives you your essential vitamins. beware that a couple of the pills are horse pills and you might need a pill cutter or crusher to get them down. you must drink a lot of water.found that my body, after forgetting to bring them with me to my significant other's house, my body seems to crash a little. i have never taken a multi vitamin before though so it is understandable as to why.will purchase again."
3,If you like horsepills,I'm sure these work but you come close to choking on them to get them all down. I don't know about you but I don't eat before working out and swallowing these on an empty stomach is not my idea of fun. Give me a powder to slip into my gym water!
4,Energy,It took a week or so for the supplements to kick it in but it gave me energy for my workouts and during the day. The quantity is great for the price. The only downside is the amount of pills in one pack. I try and take half before my workout and the other half later with a meal.
1,FAIL!,i never got this in the mail!!!! going on two months now.. i am sorry but its a bit ridiculous.
2,Get the same with less pills.,"I loved the ingredient list for this MV. It has everything an aspiring bodybuilder could want. It's one of the original BB vitamins. It's so original that it hasn't changed it's vitamin profile since 1983. Why should it when people still buy it? It banks on the popular yet misinformed novice bodybuilding community that more is better. The science exists to pack every EFFECTIVE vitamin in to one to three pills for everything that an aspiring bodybuilder could need. Universal wants you to cram eleven, yes, ELEVEN bulky pills down your throat(ok, not all of them are bulky but at least five of them are). Seriously, try something else, anything else before this hyper yellow pee inducing vitamin pak."
3,Holy.....,"I know the pills are good for me, and I know they work, just look at your pee, it's lightning yellow. The problem is that they are freakin' humungous. Well, there are 3 huge ones, they're like boats. There are 11 pills total in each little pack you're supposed to take every day, and it's like a meal. They smell like chocolate protein, it's kinda gross but bearable. I still have half a canister left, I can't finish it. Honestly i'm switching to Opti-men. Same stuff but waaay less pills."
3,MacGyver - complete fifth season review.,"i had purchased this particular set , along with the fourth season to replace some defective discs in one of Paramount's complete series sets. there were absolutely nothing special about the packaging in these sets, the discs played through in these individual sets, but looked rather clouded on the play side where reflectivity is a concern for good interruption- free viewing. it looked as though whoever packaged this rather - popular old show made little effort to show the content or the consumer much respect with this rather cheap - looking collection. the programs looked like a direct- from - video transfer, not remasters. some early programs were done in mono, and apparently were never adapted for stereo playback for today's technology. wasn't crazy about those snap- in disc holders , which either held the discs too firmly, or they would fall loose when transported. no character bios, film credits, just the bare -bones."
3,Tanks as viewed by the Social Studies department,"This book is a mixture of tank development and use and an odd viewpoint of what is after all just a tool of war. It reminds me of what book critics claim to have been in an author's mind, greatly surprising the author when he reads their words. The development of the tank and tank tactics is good; the author's psychological views of tanks and tank crews is off the wall.Still, it's worth buying for one's military library.-USAF fighter pilot, retired"
3,Mixed Reactions,"This book would have benefited from the attention of an editor; it would have become considerably shorter. I found parts quite entertaining and informative - e.g., the photographs - but then had to flip through pages of irrelevant and mindless drivel.There are many irritating errors. Thus, 'moral' is not an alternative spelling of 'morale' : they have quite different meanings. Within six lines, lieutenant Alexandra Boiko becomes Alexandra Koitos. The Prague pink tank happened in 1990, and not in 1991 as Wright repeatedly asserts."
5,Kids liked it too.,"If you are looking for something with spice that kids will like, this one is it. Mine never eat spicy food, but they liked this. It is easy to prepare, just follow the box. And stir every few minutes so the bottom doesn't get stuck or burnt. A pound of chicken sounded like alot, but it is needed to balance out the seasoning. I tried it with less chicken but it was not as good.Just add your own chicken and water. I skipped the butter as the chicken had just enough of its own fat."
2,"Ok........ But Not As Good As His Last Cd "" Night On The Town ""","I felt that on this Eric Darius cd there was too much effort put into good saxophone playing and not enough effort put into making /writing the music... I AM IN NO WAY SAYING THIS IS A BAD CD ! :) All I am simply saying is that the songs are very repititive and pretty much have the same sound and feel and seem more like pop music and after the fifth song it gets pretty boring and annoying .. again, I am not saying this cd is bad i am saying that ""night on the town"" was more relaxed ,varied and overall more enjoyable. So if you are looking for somthing simlar this is not it. :)"
4,Eric Darius Review,Good CD. A little different from what I'm used to; however not bad. i would recommend to other listeners. It's a keeper.
5,As alway a wonderful story,"I love Barbara Samuel's stories. Even with obstacles to overcome, Samuel's characters are uplifting and intelligent. I have read reviews that complain about the sappy endings, but it's these sappy endings that I love, because even if reality doesn't have HEA, these books do. And that's the point of HEA books.if you like these books you will love Robyn Carr and Linda Lael Miller's series."
5,It's JJ Walker!!,"Dino-mi-i-i-ite!!Aah...someone my own age, 26, who relies on his talents as a creative story teller to communicate to his audience, rather than on the pretentious appeal of post Gen-x (blech!!) cynicism. I appreciate the allegiance to the hard-boiled genre, which the author wears on his sleeve while allowing his imagination to freely stomp the familiar terra. I liked the book to start with, but became even more captivated by its affecting humor after reading an interview with Garcia on the www.anonymousrex.com web site, wherein the author seems the type genuinely inclined to fulfillment. Being pursuant of such worthwhile pleasure shows in his writing.I'll read the next book, I'll see the screen adaption, and one day -- when the franchise has been run through the plot mill's detail cog for the umpteenth installment (see the web site for Garcia's grand plan) -- I'll remark about the author, ""Yeah...but I really dig on his old stuff."""
4,Finally - a comprehensive P-3 book!,"In his 223 page work, David Reade has attempted to cover every P-3 variant, including some (very) little-known ones. The result is a marvellous reference work which I give 4 stars only due to its lack of an index and a small number of captioning, typographic, and minor factual errors, which somewhat detract from its utility. I'm looking forward to a 2nd edition, but wouldn't wait for one.4000+ hr P-3B TACCO/Mission Commander"
2,Bad Ending,"This book did a good job at exciting me. The more i read the more i because interested in how all these characters would intertwine. But i tell you, they didnt until the 3 very last chapters, and it was very dissapointing. The writer is good with all his descriptive words and really gets you into the characters, but for no apparent reason because they are totally discarded at the end."
1,"Boring Villians, Bad Editing","Trek's most boring Romulans ever and a painfully slow pace make this a real funkiller. Lots of extremely distracting oversights in editing, such as the narrator retelling the same bits of barely relevant backstory each time we switch to a different group of characters. Or like the first chapter when Picard cancels red alert twice within a few pages. I think this went to print before the final draft was ever proofed. I stopped 80% through because I actually didn't care how it turned out. Don't waste your time."
3,Very circular,"I felt more confused than anything. However, mostly everything that he say's is intriguing and well advanced for it's time. I mean he is the father of modern philosophy. In the end, his analysis of mind, matter and God are great."
2,Interminable Aimless Noodling,"I'm a fan of progressive rock and classical music of the baroque period, both of which tend to cultivate mastabatory solos. I'm used to it and, usually, I like it. I bought this after listening to numerous recommendations from fellow musicians over the last few decades. I just don't get what the big deal is. In his autobigraphy, Andy Summers (of Police fame) explained that he hated Coltrane the first time he heard him, but was continually drawn back, eventually came to love the music, and now regards it as highly influential in his own development. I wish my experience was the same. I've forced myself to listen to this over and over. But, for me, the soloing that pervades this recording approaches randomness."
5,One of the Great Jazz albums of all time,"This album With Miles Davis ""Kind of Blue"" are two of the most important jazz albums of all time. A timeless masterpiece."
3,In memory of Tommy Flanagan,"Coltrane woodsheds for hours a day for weeks to prepare for this album of incredibly complex harmonies - some tunes at super fast tempos - and the great Tommy Flanagan on piano has to practically sight read them right out of the box on the day of the recording and barely manages to keep up. I felt bad for him for years, because he's one of my favorites. (Check him out on Art Pepper's Straight Life for some great soulful and tasteful playing.) Anyway, glad to get this off my chest! Coltrane should have given him more time to prepare for the studio session! Nevertheless, this album is where Coltrane takes the perfection his own playing to an almost impossible standard for anyone else to match. He was driven as a musician, and one can clearly hear the results and sense his excitement about finally being able to play his own music instead having to play Green Dolphin Street for the 1000th time with the Miles Davis Quintet."
1,Very pour edition.,"Don't buy Deluxe Edition, buy Remastered Edition. Remastered edition is 24-bit transfer, Deluxe ed. is the original. In the Deluxe Ed. the CD is in the carton leave (they wanted it as in LP), unfortunately to take and return CD can scratch it.The music is Grate, Coltrane is the big master."
5,"With your last $20, buy this album!","This is the best album i own, period. John Coltrane is not only a technical master of his instrument, his tone is the most true sound that a human could make. Giant Steps brings a feeling of serenity over me which I don't get from anything else. Coltrane can play the fast, aggresive jazz and he can play the heartfelt, reflective jazz. He is a true master of jazz. Buy this album and you will not be disappointed."
5,A new look at a jazz masterpiece,"""Giant Steps"" receoves a new look with enough bonus tracks to almost double the length of the original album! I can listen to this album over and over again and continue to discover something new. Highly recommended for any music lover."
5,Beautiful and inventive album,John Coltrane / Giant Steps (with alternative tracks): John creates a wonderful mood with this album as the tracks seamlessly move from demanding invention to mellow beauty. The alternative tracks are a welcome addition. Five Stars
4,wash cloths,they along with their mates are just beautiful. they hold their shape and color after washing and are also thick and soft.
1,NOT the Amazon Quality I Expect,"I received four Pinzon hand towels and four Pinzon bath towels today and washed the first half. After one regular wash and one regular drying, the edge on one of the hand towels came out frayed and stringy. I expect this after maybe 5 or 10 years, but not the first wash.Dump this product and brand.UPDATE. Since my initial review, I discovered that one set of these towels had a chemical odor that persisted even after three washings. I threw them all in the trash. Amazon was kind enough to refund my purchase price. Thank you. I remain a loyal customer."
3,These shed more than my dog...,"And my dog sheds a LOT.After I got them I washed them and ran them through the dryer.The washer was choked with blue fuzz, as was the dryer. I've have never had bath towels shed like these."
1,Navy washcloths bleed,"I just started to take a shower with my new navy washcloth, and was quickly covered with dark blue dye. If you want to buy these washcloths, be sure to get white ones only -"
4,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the first Dean Koontz book i've ever read so I don't know how it compares to others, but I absolutly loved it. The plot doesn't stop, and complications keep finding themselves. I had about 125 pages left of the book one night and figured I'd read another chapter or two before I went to bed and ended up staying awake until 3:30 in the morning finishing the book because I couldn't put it down. You can be assured I will continue to read Koontz books in the future and this IS a must read."
2,Run-of-the-mill,"One of Koontz's so-so efforts. If I remember a Koontz book it must have been good, this barely sticks in my mind, I hardly remembered that I'd even read it."
4,"Wish it would last longer, but...","it does what it's supposed to! Love my dymo label maker, but these tapes just don't seem to last. The product itself is fine. And the size of the cartridge lends itself to a hand held label maker that is portable. So, I can live with reordering them as long as the price stays low!!"
2,Extremely disappointing,"We picked up this book thinking it would be an interesting biography of Sim Webb. Since our sons LOVE trains and the story of Casey Jones, we were all looking forward to reading it.Unfortunately, after a good beginning, and in spite of some excellent artwork, it descends into a bizarre story about the trumpet of Gabriel.It IS a folk tale. Wish we'd realized that before we'd bothered to open it."
2,"not the original book, a re-written dramatization only","This is not the orignal book by Sally Benson that the movie MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS staring Judy Garland was based on. It is a play in three acts. If you purchase this thinking you will receive the story Sally Benson wrote, you will be very disappointed like I was. I wish Amazon.com had made the product details clearer in this listing."
4,Sometimes tedious classic,"Ivanhoe is written in the wordy, somtimes tedious writing style of the Georgian Age ( Dickens and Jane Austen are also guilty). The love triangle (if you can call it that) of Ivanhoe, Rebecca and the Norman nobleman is more unlikely than that of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio in the movie Titanic. Yet, the story is interesting if one hangs with it in it's duller stretches. PS-Indicted ex-HUD secretary Henry Cisneros once bragged that he read Ivanhoe in one day when he was a boy, more proof that Mr. Cisneros has problems with the truth. Ivanhoe a one-day read-maybe a comic book version."
4,Ivanho was a great fighter and killed many men.,The Normans attacked England and fought the Saxons who fought hard but were defeated.Their was a tournament and a unknown knight came and deafeated everyone.Later he was discoverd as Ivanho.Then he was captured and a friend rescued him. He fought a man who had captured a girl he loved. They got married and had a happy life.
2,Not the greatest.,"I read this book last year in 9th grade and i thought it was the lamest book I ever read.I bought the Cliff Notes and even through them I couldn't understand ANYTHING. The whole novel is in that ancient annoying language that virtually no one can, nor wants to understand. Believe me, if you prefer literature that your brain can actually compute, skip this one."
3,Free SF Reader,"I loved all that knightly action stuff when I was younger, but I found this quite stultifying, and really had to force myself to finish it. Very, very dry. I may change my mind if I have a look at again, but given the time period, that is probably unlikely."
4,Excellent post-enlightenment recount of the medieval world,"Sir Walter Scott convinced me of his masterful storytelling ability with his Ivanhoe, and I encourage anybody interested in great literature to give this book a shot. It's up there with the best stories of the modern era."
3,Great if you don't mind the slipper look,"I haven't worn anything but arcopedico for 10 years. My feet are wide and I have a bunion. Arcopedico has stretchy uppers and a patented arch support. The Beta style has shoelaces and looks like a real shoe. I have worn them even to dressy affairs. However, the Beta is no longer available due to switch to a cheaper sole that does not hold up. This particular arcopedico style has that wonderfully comfortable stretch, good sole, and great arch support. Problem is, they run a bit smaller than I am used to and look like bedroom slippers."
5,Excellent psychological thriller,Trapped is an excellent thriller....It keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end...I have seen it 15 times so far and still get chills on certain scenes.
5,I've never read it.,"To be honest, i've never read this book or heard of it until yesterday. I heard Tim Burton was in talks of making it as his next movie. Being a major Burton fan I thought I would share my info."
2,Meaningless Effort.,"I am not sure what I read. Whatever it was, it was not what the title asserted. Thin and vaccous, the history is not grappled with. The reader is left with the feeling that the author pulled back from his subject matter.Everything is big in Texas, especially our tall tales. Whopper telling is a prideful art form. No where is it practiced to perfection better than in the telling of how this great state came to be. Separating fact from myth and outright fiction is a very difficult thing to do even for a respected historian like Robert M. Utley. At best this book is the most general of overviews. You will find nothing new here."
3,Good cd None-the-less!,"I have to say there is only one flaw to the cd. Steve sings one song too many. Vai is a Guitar god, but when it comes to using the ol' vocal-pipe, it kinda isn't so great. But let's talk about the good. Building A Church and Freak Show Excess, are some of the catchiest songs written by Steve Vai. Not to mention I bought the cd just for Lotus Feet. That song is the BOMB! If you like solo music, I would recommend this cd to you. If you just like band stuff, I wouldn't."
5,Experimentally delicious!,"Alright, that's a weird way of putting it, but Vai is known for his weird musical tendencies, and that's what you get with this. What is interesting is that about four songs have vocals. Steve's vocals! And even though singing isn't his forte, he's not bad at it. There's the fun and upbeat ""Firewall"" and the more tender and intimate ""I'm Your Secrets"" and a few others. Vai is still his experimental self, going all out with ""Freak Show Excess"", a more laid-back jam with Jibboom, fun with effects on Yai Yai, and a live, spiritual, cinematic piece called ""Lotus Feet"".I like Steve Vai, the experimentalist, and in that vein, I was rewarded when I bought this."
3,Doomed Duo,"A starry-eyed account of the doomed pair's romance by Dodi's butler. So protective is Delorm of his late boss that he never mentions model Kelly Fisher, whom he must have known Dodi was two-timing after Diana came along.But Delorm's devotion can be touching. ""You left me,"" he wrote in the condolence book at Dodi's funeral, and then dissolved into tears.A very one-sided look into a doomed duo's romance."
2,Average anti-spyware program,"I've had this program for a year and found it to be kind of annoying. It started with the blocking of what seemed like every website I visited from CNN to the NY Times. Eventually I just turned that feature off. I also found the software to be a serious resource hog. I found it to be just as good at trying to find spyware as Ad-Aware and Spybot but those programs are free. Plus Spybot and Windows Defender offer real time protection and don't use as much resources as Spyware Doctor. Eventually I just let the subscription lapse. By the way, don't even think about installing this program on more than one machine. I installed it on my computer and when I installed it on my laptop it bounced the subscription from my computer. With the quality and free anti-spyware software that is available, I can't really recommend this software especially if you have two machines at home."
2,Not worth it...,"Beliave me this item is not that good as it seems...I bought it 2 days ago, i installed and i can't Update it.. it is showing me some kind of errors... my computer is brand new, i got it 2 weeks ago...I prefer to everybody that you use Stopzilla..."
5,A wonderfully arranged and performed album.,"This is Elis at her best (was she ever anything else?) ""Bodas de Prata"" is a wonderful almost art-song-like composition. ""Deixa o Mundo e Sol Entrar"" is a basic popular song sung so well and tastefully arranged. ""Bonita"" by Jobim is sung in English, but the language barrier doesn't hamper her style or pronounciation. The superbly-rhythmic ""Ou Bola Ou Bulica"" shows the typical perfection Elis achieved in singing complex rhythms. But for most part it's a fairly quiet album which grows on you with repeated listenings."
5,Great kit!,"This is the first kit I've ordered from Ramsey, but certainly not the last! This thing was a great learning project for my mentee and me to work on. Great kit!"
5,Fcuk perfume,This product was very good and as a gift was received with great excitement? The pricing on this item is very reasonable
1,cheap,"This medical kit is very cheap. I tried using the dropper, and it was terrible. I threw everything away after realizing they were not worth keeping."
3,"Great for me, kids got bored in one day","i liked this game very much, but i bought it for my kids so i could get some dishes done. but my kids kept getting stuck in the water on the first level many times or it makes you redo levels that are 2 hard-- guess who has to help and still cant do dishes in peace--a little to hard for small kids"
3,Fun toy but not as expected,"The description of this toy is misleading. My 3yr old son was to small to even use it correctly. He is 38' tall but his feet could not touch the floor. I had my mother deflate it slightly so he could use it, overall he had fun. My 11 yr old brother fits this toy much better."
4,"great album but ""Bad Girls"" 12"" version is missing","This album claims to include the 12"" version of ""Bad Girls"" on disc 2, but it is, in fact, identical to the standard version on disc 1."
5,TLove,"Great updated version of a cordless rechargeable screwdriver. Comes with all the accessories you need and the cradle that it charges in keeps it all organized. Now, we can assemble ANYTHING! :)Thanks Black & Decker and Amazon, excellent value!"
3,A little underpowered.................,"If all you want to do is remove light plate screws and small fasteners, this is the screwdriver for you. Great concept, little power."
3,Not very reliable,"Very good battery life with minimal self-discharge, decent torque for such a light unit, nice ""feel,"" but not very high quality. The trigger switch is intermittent and requires variable effort and occasional whacking, and the charger died after a few months of very light use. Unimpressed."
4,good movie,i enjoyed this movie and would say if you enjoyed the first one you wold like this one as well
1,Part 2's suck - this proves it,"We watched it since we really liked Part 1. Part 2 has the same low-budget super-realistic feel, but the similarities end there. There is no tension in the movie. Thankfully its not very long."
2,Worse than the first,"Ok, I am convinced sequels can't outdo the originals. This tried to tie the 2 movies together and did an ok job with the plot. But how far can you go with a storyline of 'ghost whom you never see, terrorizes family'. Take that and see what you come up with. I think the Blair Witch Project was scarier. Pretty lame things went on, it seemed rushed, and like it was grasping for something scarier than the original that it couldn't get a hold of. Save your time and skip it cause it sucked."
4,Just as good as the first one,Paranormal Activity 2 ... just as good as the first. It has the REAL feeling to it and so many surprises throughout the movie you sit on the edge of your seat.Picking up about a few months before the first Paranormal Activity it shows you how things came to be and then what happened after Paranormal Activity's events took place.Great sequel. It left it WIDE open for another.Is Paranormal Activity 3 in the works? I SURE HOPE SO. This has been a great ride so far. I'd like to see MORE. I am sure I am not the only one.
3,It was ok,I expected more from all of the paranormal so maybe I am biased but this one was not as well done in my opinion
2,What's scarier than something? How about anything,The first Paranormal Activity won points as much for its originality as for how scary it was. Sadly PA2 is neither very scary nor very original. The film has all the same things that scared us in the first one and as usual everything occurs off camera so we don't see much that is very scary. I laugh at these people who let their video cameras do all the talking and don't consult with anyone who may know more about the issue.I would tell people to avoid this movie because it is very dull and not very scary. Watch The Exorcist if you want to see a really scary movie!
4,More of the Same,"Paranormal Activity benefits from a slightly larger budget, but suffers from not being as unique as the first. The story is a prequel and sequel, it wraps around the original story and adds more layers to it. It is good and has some decent scares. If you loved the first movie, then I think this is a must for you."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"I don't have much to say about this one. It wasn't bad, A little more hokier than the first, definatly not as scary, but still pretty entertaining for what it was."
4,Depends if you have the imagination of a gnat,"A movie like this, or Blair Witch, or the first PA really depends on the viewer's imagination. Some people have none, so a movie like this isn't going to be for them at ALL.I think slasher, high budget, super effects have blown away many people's imagination."
3,"Lots of fun, but George is a better option for us","Lots of fun, but in our experience Rody tends to tip too much. We've had much better luck with George the Bouncing Horse. Purchased over a year ago for our now 2.5yo, it's still played with regularly (and our almost 6yo thinks it's pretty fun too!). George's feet are much wider and he's far more stable."
5,Many beautiful photographs covering many regions of the U.S.,"This book is a must-have reference for anyone interested in the decorative arts. I am a decorative painter and am always on the look-out for reference books that not only teach about the history of the art, but also contain many pictoral examples for inspiration. This book fits the bill."
4,When you need to know about Labview...,Definitely read this book. It offers step by step instructions for basic functionality and also descriptive graphics which enhance the comprehension. It is by far the most far-reaching and intelligent book I have read about this tool.
5,Remarkable Guitar and Blues-Rock Album,This is a classic.A must have for any fan of Clapton.Have listened to it for 20y.
3,"Great band, Ok CD","I have been a Texas fan since I first heard 'I Don't Want A Lover' in 1989 and have searched out every release I could find here in the states. I waited patiently while my local independent shop ordered the import of Red Book and eagerly picked it up when it arrived. The disc is good, but doesn't measure up to most of their earlier work. If I had it to do again, I'd wait until I found a good used copy for a reasonable price. If you'd like to hear how this should have sounded, check out the song 'Number One' by Goldfrapp."
1,NOT INTERESTING,"Cet article ne donne pas un look sérieux, a fait comme du toc. Il fait genre pacotille alors que la photo ne le laisse pas entrevoir. Les boules orange sont faites de billes transparentes qui lui donne un genre 'pour adolescent'. Je ne m'y attendais pas du tout."
3,"Good, but not the best.....","I like One Voice because they started as a pop girl group. They had the freestyle beats and the soft and angelic voices that could harmonize right into your ears. But their last two albums, I guess they changed thier style of music from pop to R&B, maybe a growing up make over thingy. I'm not a fan of R&B, never was. So being R&Bish I give this album a 3/5. But I still love the girls."
5,Recieved in time,Child hood favorite A great story teller the songs and music are very enjoyable for children to sing. Great fun to watch
1,Very practical and easy to use,"Although we're fairly avid do-it-yourselfers, this is our first laser level. It is very easy to use. I love the vertical/horizontal feature. It does require a small hole in the wall to hang it on, but we haven't found that to be a problem.It also works well lying on the floor for aligning tile, etc. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for the average DIY-er.**UPDATE**I would no longer recommend this product. I realized a few months after purchase that the level isn't level!! I was painting stripes (horizontal) around a room, and discovered that the ""level"" line is off -- nearly an inch off by the time I made it across two walls.We no longer use this level because it is just ""off."" No good."
2,I though Black and Decker was better than this,"Black and Decker has an excellent idea but needs to make this out of harder plastic.I broke mine while hamming of a wall and it fell on carpet from 3 ftgive me a break.I was able to fix it but still the point.Otherwise a good tool marks around corners and shoots a great beam no ""special glasses""Like the older ones.Good tool for a homeowner but not up to par for daily use.Also the sonic tape measure is good for estimating but I would cut anything by its measurement if thats what you have in mind."
1,Wont Work on Mac OS X,"As with several reviewers I cannot load this on a Mac with OS 10.6. The installers says that it needs a ""Classic Environment"" - that's more that a decade old! I recommend that Amazon pull this item or put in a product warning for Mac users."
1,Would not load on Win 7 32-bit,I have no idea how the game actually plays as it would not load. So buy it at your own risk. If you can make it work let me know.
5,enjoyed the format,these DVDs have short practices that offer a lot of variety. the thing i liked most was that there is no music and no distractions. a voice over describes the moves while someone in a totally bare white room performs them. i enjoy the narrator's calm voice.
3,Conair HH400 Collapsable Bonnet dryer,This dryer takes too long to dry my hair. My hair is long & thick. plus these dryer is extremely LOUD
3,Too much for Grandma,It may work fine but was too difficult for an 88 year old grandma to set up and take down. It is more difficult than her old Gold-N-Hot she had had for years..
3,Not great but gets the job done,"This dryer isn't great but it gets the job done. Because of compact design, all the holes blowing the air are on the top of the hood and there are none on the side.My hair is about shoulder length and the dryer gets most of if, but the part past my chin doesn't get as much air so doesn't dry at the same rate os the rest of my hair.I do like the design and judging by the way it dries the top of my head, I think if I had rollers on or shorter hair this would be fine. I am willing to live with the design since it takes up a lot less room to store compared to a conventional hooded dryer."
4,It gets the job done!,"Well, I was pleasantly surprised when the dryer came sooner that I had expected it. It is light weight and compact, easy to use and store.(I keep mine under my bed) It's not like the traditional hood dryers; it has a sleeker design for the hood, that actually fits over the base when it is collapsed.It is a bit noisy but you get used to it and it has just two settings (High or Low). It accomodates my large rollers and dries pretty quickly. My hair(medium/thick shoulder length hair) takes about an hour to dry. I am very satisfied with this dryer (& the price)and would recommend it to anyone looking for one."
4,Great,It got a 4 out or 5 because the bottom of my hair does remain a tad dampBUT I still have to blow dry my hair again after I take my rollers out so it was no problemSuper great product for the priceAND there is tons of spaceI love how you can adjust it to your height
1,hair dryer really blows big time (pun intended),"i've never ordered this type of dryer before..and I thought the collapsible was a great idea. But 1st time using it was horrible. I noticed a distinct odor blowing at first it smelled like it was burning....but then something else no idea what it was it wasn't 2 minutes when I had problems breathing, chest pain when attempted to breathe and burning eyes. Once I turned it off and the air cleared the problem stopped. I don't know what that problem was all about but it should be on recall. I ended up having to return it. I couldn't understand conair is a good brand. I wouldn't recommend this particular dryer to anyone."
2,Not so good.....,"I have used this hair dryer about 4 times so far and each time the sides and the hair on the nape of my neck is not just damp, but soaking wet. Even when you adjust the hood to the lowest possible height, you will walk away with parts of your hair sloppy wet. Pleeeeaaasse done purchase this..............."
5,"the best hair dryer and buss transaction, fair price ,happy!","Had many hair dryer before but this is the best ,easy to handle ,easy to closed,easy to storage, I'M so happy with this item best purchase !"
2,"Looks nice, not user friend","first off, it looks really nice and professional.Backlights works great in the dark but doesnt illuminate the hotkeys so thats the first flaw i noticed. Typing with it is horrible, the key are not smooth like most other keyboards. Everytime you type it sounds like a typewriter. Most of the time when i try to type a letter, i always skip letters with this keyboard. Buttons are hard to press."
2,fragile antenna; broke first day,"Great concept and probably pretty good otherwise, but antenna is stiff and broke at base almost right out of the box. Our old plug in radio's antenna has held up close to 30 years. No excuse for one like this. Technology is not new; poor execution, weak materials, something."
4,Product long discontinued--may be battery issues,"On first unpacking mine, it would play for only a few seconds after cranking for two minutes. A call to Eton (800-872-2228) revealed that the model has been discontinued for 4-5 years, and the built-in NIMH battery pack had expired. They sent me a new battery with no hassle, and it works fine.Paul"
2,Crappy rehash without the heart of the original,"I was so excited when I picked this up. Too bad it is a sub-par ""what if"" story. The art is kind of soulless compared to the compelling original, and the characters and motivations seem flat and cliched. Nothing like the innovative Battle Angel I know and love."
4,"increased violence, decreased story content","Yup - this new volume of Battle Angel is more violent than anything, and doesn't really explain all the mechanics of just how Alita came to be in Tiphares, and what is going on.But given that Alita herself only just became conscious of being on Tiphares, of the city itself being strewn into chaos, should the reader really expect all the explanations to come in one volume? The Battle Angel world is unfathomably large and complex, and I think it is appropriate that Mr. Kishiro has held off on these details until Alita & co's arrival in Ketheres in Volume 3.Readers who find this and the second volume a bit lacking in storyline will be duly rewarded for sticking in there at volume 3 - as Mr. Kishiro opens up a whole new universe full of interplanetary politics, class disparity and a bit of political commentary on current day events, if one looks hard enough."
4,K&N Replacement air filter review,"this item is a very good quality made. it increases my Toyota AVALON performance by little. also, the performance will be observed when you compare your car with other one of the same brand. it will differ by little and not that much. i advise others to try it."
3,Good information and fun to read,This book is packed with inforamation. If you get this book coupled with Dan Poynter's books you will be in good shape. The marketing section is a bit weak- so check out Bill Parkhurst's How To Get Publicity or of course Guerrilla Marketing for Writers.Rick Frishman President Planned TV Arts (NYC) ... Co author GUERRILLA PUBLICITY (Adams Media) and GUERRILLA MARKETING FOR WRITERS (Writers Digest Books)
4,Very subversive--but I mean that in a good way.,"To be perfectly honest, after reading a couple of chapters of ""Polymorph"", I wasn't sure I that was going to enjoy this book, because I intially found the protagonist's life-style so trite and unappealing. As she begins to search for the other polymorph, I became a little more interested, but still wasn't really blown away by it all. That is, until the last two chapters. The way this book ends is so chilling and so subtly subversive that it redeems practically all that has gone on before. I highly recommend it, just for the unexpectedly viscious little twist at the end."
5,Greatly amazed,"I was really amazed with this product, the book Polymorph. When I ordered the product I was expecting slight damage but I was surprised when the book was like new, except for the yellowing pages. The friend I bought the book for love the gift and I am extremely happy with it. Thank you."
2,Not Very Good,"I was disappointed. This show scared me when I was a kid. Not now, of course, but some of the better shows that I can remember are not there. Picture quality not good, sound quality worse."
4,Take this One Step Beyond...,"John Newland was as creepy as Rod Serling was strange. That's the only comparison worthy between these two shows. So often comparisons spring forth between Zone and Step, but they are neither justified, nor accurate.Zone is generally a charachter study of people in the most perplexing of situations that could never take place in the real world.Step is a study of unexplainable events that were documented by the people the events affected, then dramatized by actors.Step was not only enormously entertaining to watch, it was smart in execution. Newland not only hosts, but also directs many episodes. Anyone who is a fan of the genre of the unexplained should definitely take a look at this incredible show.Show rating: 5 stars, DVD transfer: 3 stars, packaging: 2 stars (12 DVD's in regular size Amaray cases in a flimsy posterboard thickness paper box sleeve??! Come on guys, we collectors deserve a smarter, more space saving and quality package.)Overall rating: 4 stars"
3,The shiws are excellent...the detail that went into producing this product was weak,"Each of these 12 dvd's contains 4 episodes (or approximately 100 minutes)I was rather disappointed by the absence of the titles to each story, although they did a nice short summary of each.I also have the 4 dvd set which contains a total of 20 shows (5 per dvd)..Many of those are included on this set. The visual quality is the same as the 4 dvd set.There were a total of 95 episodes....this set has 48....So where are the other 47 shows?????"
4,From the cover:,"From the back of the book:The author brings Acts to life for this day. He blends thorough biblical scholarship with wisdom from extensive and varied experience in missionary work and bible teaching. Careful exposition is supplemented with literary and theological discussion. The key word in Acts is witness for Jesus Christ, from Jerusalem to the ends of the earth. God's Spirit anoints the church at Pentecost, leads believers in handling conflicts between converts new and old, and empowers Christians to overcome false beliefs and magic. In Acts, Luke tells this dramatic story with subtle humor."
3,Doesn't go the distance,"I've had my swivel case for about 8 months, and I expect some wear and tear. I but I don't expect the straps that cover the top of the phone to wear down. I don't know how, but they're tearing, and I'll have to replace this soon. If you use your phone often, don't get this. The material doesn't last as long as it should- even for the price.On a lighter note, I've dropped my phone several times, and no breaks yet (knocks on wood), so it does that much at least."
4,The story of a fair trial,"Louis Nizer brings the perspective of a lawyer to this review of the Rosenberg trial. He takes you through the trial, day by day, discusses the strategy of the opposing sides, and makes a judgement -- the trial was proper, and the jury was justified in coming to the conclusion that the defendents were guilty. He's also careful to warn you about the things you can't know, such as the difference between reading what was said, and seeing it yourself.The big flaw in this book is the lack of sources. You can't always tell where Nizer got his information. But unless you want to wade through the trial transcript and briefs, this is the best description of the process that led to the Rosenbergs' conviction. It's a fairminded, honest book, and I recommend it."
4,Fun,This was just good old fun. If you like Judy Garland you'll want this for your collection. Her and Gene Kelly pair up again and they are delightful together.
1,No sign of 'Every Sunday',"No fan of Judy Garland, I ordered this DVD on the strength of another reviewer's remark that it contained the short subject 'Every Sunday', starring the young Deanna Durbin (and Judy Garland); indeed I had been searching high and low for one that did. Sadly it is not there."
4,Summer Stock,"While the plot of Summer Stock is simplistic, the movie is saved by the terrific dancing of Gene Kelly and the chemistry between the Kelly and Judy Garland characters. Summer Stock is an innocuous but enjoyable musical."
5,Lovely And Honest,"Mozart's Wife is a delightfully written novel about Wolfgang Mozart as seen through the eyes of his beloved wife Konstanze.It's admiringly paced with its ongoing drama between husband and wife. The dialogue is charged with reality, sexuality and humor.Waldron effortlessly draws the daily crisis's Konstanze must endure during her marriage to a fickle, impractical genius who is her genuine heart's desire.This is exceptionally researched. Its setting's in the various cities of Prague, Venice, ets., sparkle with the energy and exhilaration of the era.It is very much Konstanze's chronicle of growth, reasonableness and love that makes this novel a pleasurable read from start to finish."
3,Nice book,"An easy read about the man Mozart, his temperament, his character, his attitudes, his fortunes, his genius and his family life, especially his wife. Not much reference to the Zeitgeist though!"
2,So So,"I always enjoy historical fiction and thought this might be interesting. Parts of the book were, others were just ""fluff"" and didn't have any relevance that I could see. I nearly quit reading the book a couple times, but stuck with it to the end. The book did give a pretty clear picture of life in those times, which was interesting, but I kept getting annoyed at the ""fluff"" that would appear, i.e., the conversation between two women in the ""privey"" and what sort of magazines they might use to finish their business....had no bearing on the story line and seemed like something the writer just added for filler."
2,"Looks great, but too flimsy for my taste.","I wanted to like this, and bought it based on reviews here on Amazon. For the most part, this toy is okay. However, the elevator does not work that well. The problem I am having is that the small forks on the conveyor chain constantly hang up both at the ball pick up point and drop off point. The clearances around the forks are quite small but the ""slop"" in the chain and other structural pieces make alignment difficult, at least in our set. I have managed to greatly enhance operation by filing down the problem areas, but this is not what I expect from a toy costing this much. I also agree with an earlier reviewer that it is unfortunate that standard, larger marbles will not work in this toy.Having said all that, I must admit that our son really enjoys this set a lot."
1,lots of swearing,"wow, the language this thing brought out! We can't seem to get the elevator lined up so it will keep running...I will report more later after a complete tear down and rebuild. Hopefully we can get it running by New Year's."
5,Bravo! Fun & easy to assemble,"My 6-year-old received this marble run as a gift from her uncle. I'm amazed at how easy it was to assemble and at how well the elevator works. It's mesmerizing to watch and my 3-year-old is also getting a kick out of it; she keeps shouting ""They're going to the fair!"" (referring to the marbles who look like they are getting on a ferris wheel). It's refreshing, too, to see a well-made plastic toy these days - the parts are solid and fit together easily. The product is made in Italy - and it shows."
1,Very Difficult to Build,"Purchased this toy for our 8yr old son who loves to put things together. Very difficult to put together, pieces don't snap on well and when they are together the whole thing falls apart and is rendered useless (unless you have the patience of a saint to re-do the whole thing !). Would recommend another toy for sure - very disappointed !"
4,A must for upcoming trips to Colorado,"I purchased this book for my sister-in-law who is planning to take a driving trip through Colorado. She was thrilled with the contents and will take several of their recommendations.The book gives all kinds of ideas to make for a memorable trip, restaurants, hotels, off the beaten path types of things that you could not know about.Great value!"
1,Doesn't Work,"I purchased this product based on many recommendations, but it doesn't work. It hasn't opened up (or reduced) one single pimple or cyst I've tried it on. All it has served to do is smell bad and make my face sticky."
1,Waste of money,"I hate it, because it simply didn't work, just makes your skin oily and disgusting, and has a really bad smell."
5,The best kept secret!,"Prid drawing salve is the best product in it's category hands down!!! I have been using this for years and the new formula is just as good as the old one . I highly recommend this salve to treat minor cuts and scrapes.The price was a great deal and I will be ordering more. I had a slight problem , but the seller quickly fixed it ( it used to say 20g and the tins were actually 18g) by sending me a free one to make up the difference."
3,SHORT BATTERY LIFE BUT IS ACCURATE,"To borrow words from another reviewer in refference to Sight-Rite's Bullet Laser Bore Sighter, they really SHOULD be ashamed of including such LOW QUALITY batteries with these bore sighters. Other than that, the units seem to work just fine and do cut down on the amount of ammo needed/used to get a rifle or handgun sighted in.Yes, I'd reccomend any of Sight-Rite's Bore Sighters. I'd also reccomend you don't waste your time w/the batteries supplied and get a better set before you go out into the field to use this item for the first time..."
4,What a great story teller!,"Excellent effort for a first time novelist. I would have given it 5 stars, but the start was a bit slow. Not to worry, the author makes up for it in spades with a thrilling ride through a volcano. Yes, inside a volcano. I'm heading for Hawaii to view this first hand. I vote this work ""a must read"" and recommend it to all my friends."
1,Silly Silly Silly,"The Misadventures of Tim McPick is a time piece. It was written in 1975, when radical was chic and homophobia was rampant everywhere. As a time capsule, this book is interesting.However, it is also one of the silliest books I've ever read. It may be called a comedy, but this is insulting the word comedy. The story line is so very biased and improbable that it is hard to keep reading.Unless you are interested in the world of the mid 1970's, pass this one up."
5,I Have To Admit...,"Ok, when I read the other review I did wonder just how much of a fuss one can make over a piece of wood with numbers on it. But he's right. This simply isn't your average wooden ruler. It's thick, heavy, balanced, easy to pick up, and easy to read. I plan to order other items by Westcott.On this ruler the zero and 12"" marks are not at the very ends of the ruler. This helps with the accuracy of certain measurements. However, I like occasionally to be able to butt the end against a surface and take a measurement away from the surface. So on one ruler, I trimmed the zero end so that the zero mark is right at the end of the ruler. If you try this, do it very carefully to maintain accuracy.Anyway, great product - pleasant surprise."
1,Terrible- Get Hoyle's Casino 2008 instead,"All of the slots and poker machines in this game are more-or-less the same thing, just different pictures. There are none of the multi-reel video slot machines, and there is no multi-hand video poker. Save your money and get Hoyle Casino 2008 instead- it has a better selection of slots and video poker, plus all the other casino games to boot."
5,best gumbo base out there,"This is authentic stuff. I add chicken (rotisserie)and sausage, okra, green onions and whatever vegetable in my refrigerator that I have that would be appropriate. I serve it over brown rice and voila! We love it and the price is excellent."
4,Very disturbing,"I like it although I think it needed to specify the relationships Kurt had with the people he wrote letters to. You figure them out, but it would be easier if we knew at that moment who we were reading about, instead of finding out at the notes in the back of the book. He talks about killing himself all the time. No one saw this coming. His symtoms: the Manic depression. I was taken aback by the complete lack of attention his family gave him. But, it was fated for him to die."
3,You know you want to read it,"Yes, there's the moral corundum of disrespecting a dead man's wishes and invading his privacy to make an easy buck off him, but Journals is an interesting read. I'm not a huge Nirvana fan, but I did get a voyeuristic kick out of perusing his handwritten rants, unsent letters, drafted lyrics, rambling diary entries, and assorted scribbles and doodles.That is not say Journals is essential in understanding Kurt - his music was just as effective in that regard. There's nothing in this book to shed any new light on his complicated personality, though time will tell if that's just a result of Courtney Love's selectivity.Journals is put together nicely and works as a really morbid coffee table book. But to ease your guilt of exploiting Kurt's death to make Courtney's wallet thicker, while still satiating your curiosity, I would recommend simply borrowing it from a library."
3,i don't know about this...,"ok. the reason i gave this book only 3 stars is because i haven't read it, i don't know if i will, i probably would give it 5 stars if i had read it though.i totally agree that it should not be read...but Kurt probably knew that it would happen, i mean, he predicted Nirvana's fame; he predicted they would be ""hailed as the most thought-provoking band of the 90s"" or something like that, he predicted how long they would be number one, he predicted what awards they would win...so it wouldn't surprise me if he knew that his murderous wife would publish his thoughts...(he was considering divorce). so it's probably ok to read this...i'm still not going to though. i'd be spinning in my grave if someone else was reading my journals, whether i was famous or not...that's why i don't keep any."
5,Just a nice collection,"It's fun to flip these pages. You'll see a lot of writing, less of art. There is no story telling or even coherence in this published work. Really cool to own, sometimes you'll get a glimpse of what was going on in his mind."
4,A Captivating Journey,"This is a very good book which tells the story of the life of Kurt Coabin by using his journal entries. By looking at his drawings and entries, you can really tell what kind of person he really is. I highly reccomend this book to any Nirvana fan."
3,My opinions,"if someone asked me to recomend the Kurt Cobain journals to someone else I probably would, because I enjoyed the book myself. This book gave me the chance to find out things about Kurt that not many people have to. The book pretty much summerized up all the important events and people in Cobains life.It also shows how Nirvana made it to the top.It has letters that were sent to record companies and lyrics to songs.Therefore those are the reasons why I would recomend the Journal of Kurt Cobain to anyone of his millions of fans"
2,dance upon the grave,"While Kurt Cobain certainly had some interesting things to say, I'm appalled that so many fans find this book to be the acceptable way of digesting those things. Am I the only one who finds this work to smack of greedy betrayal by MS. Hole herself?To place this work in a design format that reads like a high school journal is a further insult to injury that detracts from a man who shaped a generation.Whatever one thinks of the brilliance, or lack thereof, of Nirvana, I scratch my head in dismay at the popularity of this work. The same lasciviousness that goes into the craving and absorbing of this book was the kind of stuff that added to this guy's downfall.Go ahead and salivate over this creative mind's output while he can do nothing about it. Why don't you consider a dance party ala Darlene Routier while you're at it!"
1,You'll be sorry,"The first thing you'll notice when you unpack this drive is the improper grammar used on the packaging, which indicates the drive was made in China.The second thing you'll notice is the unusual machine marks on the side of the drive, reminiscent of a product slapped together in a third world country.Even without plugging the drive in, you know you're in trouble by this point. But you hope that you're not like everyone else whose written a bad review of the product. Maybe I'll be different and mine will work.After you plug it in, it works and you breathe a sigh of relief. I did for all of 3 1/2 minutes. Then mine died. It won't power up again, either in the external drive case or the internal slot in my Dell.You'll be sorry if you buy this drive. You won't be different. You'll own a brick like the rest of us.Hey, but some people only learn by experience (myself included)."
5,The best manga series!!!!!,"In this manga it has many different characters that are supposed to be aliens. Washu has created some of the characters like ryoko(?) There is Sasami the youngest that takes care of house work and there is Washu, Tenchi, Ayeka( sasami's older sister), and more. in all READ IT THIS MANGA SERIES ROCKS ^^"
1,Total deception,"When it comes to these cheapie DVDs, there are many instances of deceptive packaging. This one, however, is probably the worst example since it's an outright lie. Despite the claim on the front that states ""Rod Steiger in AL CAPONE"" and the listing running time of 105 minutes on the back, this is actually a 50-minute 1998 TV documentary that contains a fleeting clip of Steiger from the 1959 movie that I thought I was getting. So how is the documentary? I wouldn't know, because I can't be bothered to sit through it. But don't blame the filmmakers...blame Digiview. As the old saying goes, ""When you're expecting ice cream, even the best fish tastes like poison."" Or how about this one: Spend your money on something--ANYTHING--else."
2,Simplistic,"The ideas presented in the book are very simplistic. I expected more of Eleanor Roosevelt's story, her reflections, and leadership lessons."
1,"Riley in the morning, boring all day long","I have always been a Sandra Brown fan, but this book truly is not one of her best works. The plot is very juvenile, and I could not for the life of me, understand why Brin left Riley. So what if he is more popular, is that a reason to leave a man and consider a divorce. Reading this story made me feel like I was back in elementary school. BORING, BORING, BOOOOOOOOOORING!!!!!!!!!!"
1,One of Brown's worst stories,"I had the misfortunate of listening to RILEY IN THE MORNING read by Alison Fraser. By the middle of the second tape I was so ready for it to be done I kept fast forwarding through it. I thought that Brin was such a jerk. Riley was meant to be a jerk at times but Brin was supposed to be this hot shot producer. Instead she turns into the wimpiest character I have ever seen in a Sandra Brown book. And her reason for leaving Riley was the DUMBEST reason I can imagine. It is hard to have sympathy for a character who up and leaves without giving the man she purports to love a chance to work things out. That is crass and ridiculous to the extreme. As you can see, I HATED this book. And I hate that I hated it because, truth be told, I LOVE Sandra Brown's later works. She improved dramatically. If you want the real Brown, don't start with this book. It is drivel of the worst kind."
1,I think I might yak.,"Formulaic, to say the least. I know if I had read this book ten years ago, I would have loved it. However, now I read the romantic novels less for the sex and more for the plot."
3,Lukewarm romance for two stubborn lovers,"""Riley in the Morning"" is not necessarily a BAD book...but Sandra Brown has done soooo much better in her other romance novels. Sure...this book is a quick read and may hold one's attention for a bit....but it lacks alot of the emotion from some of her other releases. Riley was stubborn and somewhat selfish and so was Brin. It kind of left a bad taste in my mouth as far as endings. I will continue to read all of Sandra's books in the future because she has alot of talent."
3,I've Read This...,"Thankfully I didn't buy this book, my mother in law lent it to me. But I'm reading it and thinking ""I have read this"" and sure enough, I checked the hardbacks publication date and notice it was published originally in 1985!! HATE THAT when they ""repackage"" books nad put them back out.The story was just ""ok"". The hero was kinda a jerk who makes you wonder ""what does she see in him anyway"", which never makes for a great book. Check out some of her other more recent works as she is a great author. This just is not her best (or most recent!!) work."
2,Poor plot,"If you're a diehard Sandra Brown fan, then wait for the paperback, because there's no way this book merits hardcover status. The plot is beyond poor. Brin's reason for leaving Riley is one of the dumbest I've read. Consider Riley a saint for putting up with this ridiculous and annoying woman. I expected better from Ms. Brown, as this book seemed rushed."
4,"We Love it, but just so you are aware","My son is only 2 and he loves the Alphabet Bus. He had the original My First Leap Pad but it seemed to be a little mis-wired and did not work correctly. My son loves the Beep-beep of the bus and listening to the Wheels on the Bus song.The things you should be aware of if switching from a traditional My First Leap Pad are:-The letters on the bus are not indented as they are on the original insert that comes with the Leap Pad which makes it harder for little ones to trace because the letters are quite small-The bus does not have a head phone jack like the original does, which we thought was a great feature on the Mt First Leap Pad"
1,Not worth reading,"This book is a typical Toffler mishmash of speculation and rambling incoherencies. Even if you can get through the first few chapters, it's not worth whatever mark-down price the stores are offering it at. Suggest you read the work of more cogent futurists."
3,"Small Upgrades, Some Issues","There are some important additions, such as clustering and failover support, and a few niceties like user-defined functions and indexed views. Upgrading the data format from 7 to 8 was seamless, but replication was painful. Gone are the Enterprise Manager HTML-based pages at the machine level, replaced by a small maze of things to do to make replication happen. We finally had to reinstall the server to make replication happy. The help file on this topic is a joke. It reads something like ""Step 1, configure replication. Step 2, start it up."" with absolutely no detail.My bottom line: take your time in upgrading."
2,Not as advertised!,"The details describe this as new, full retail box. This is not the case. What we received was a cd with the license key sticker attacehed to the jewel case. The jewel case looked scratched and used."
5,RCA 100 ANOS DE MUSICA,"originaly released in 1983 untitled became known as ""panelha velha"" bacause of hit song of same name. Sergio Reis sings a song called ""MEU SITIO,MEU PARAISIO"" together with the original composer-`ZE do RANCHO [ the top guitar player of brazilian country music].The great success of this song is due to the MILLIONS of Brazilians who had migrated from the ""interior"" of Brazil to the ""Industrial cities [SAO PAULO-RIO ]and related to the MUSIC because they were ""living"" the lyrics which spoke of the ""culture shock"" of a loud,fast paced city life with air and water pollution. In other words what brazilians call ""SAUDADE""!This cd made from the original tape is what made Sergio Reis #1 singer of ""SERTANEJO"" - Country music in Brazil."
4,Great value for money,This is a fabulous anthology - all the stories are lovely especially those by Mary Balogh and Edith Layton. Well worth getting a copy if you can.
2,keep looking,"The book offers a high level recap of Super Chief and El Capitan facts and lore. The author's fondness for the subject is evident. There are many photographs, especially of the car interiors. All photographs are black and white. Note that very few will be new to readers that have read any other book on these trains or even the ATSF railroad in generalUnfortunately, lack of content, pervasive bad grammar and typos make this a difficult read.Instead please look for a used copy of ""Santa Fe Streamliners: The Chiefs and their Tribesmen"" by Karl R. Zimmermann for an excellent book on the Chiefs, or a new copy of ""Santa Fe Railway (Railroad Color History)"" by Steve Glischinski for a great account of ATSF history."
2,relatively poor quality,"The paper is soft and rather flimsy compared to similar products I have used. The gummed binding is also poor and does not securely hold the sheets. If you need to make notes on more than one page, the top page will detach no matter how gently you attempt turn it back."
1,Painful to watch.,"Doesn't work as a comedy or drama, attempts both. I am a fan of penelope cruz (I highly recommmend 'open your eyes') but this film was terrible - filled with stupid cliches and an unconvincing plotline, including misguided allusions to ""Cassablanca"" which this films suffers by comparision.There is ONE redeeming scene: when P. Cruz performs musical number in traditional anduluscian dress."
4,Improves an understanding of creativity in architecture,This book provides multiple perspectives to better understand how to take an 'out of the box' perspective when approaching systems architecting. You'll get out of it what you put into it. Enjoy.
1,I would give it NO stars if I could,"I received my package, opened it and placed them in my cabinets....... wondering why there is no scent.....smells like a block of wood. So I waited thinking that it would be more noticeable once it was in a closed area overnight. So I waited...waited....waited....even by the next day there was NO lavender scent....no cedar sent.....I can hear the moths laughing at me! Waste of money"
5,Mandy's Review!,"I think this book was so awesome! It's my favorite show, and I'm 14 I just didn't want to fill out the other form. Like I said, Everwood is my favorite show, and the book is even better because it tells you what Ephram is thinking! You can usually tell by his facial expressions which is awesome cause he's so cute, but it's nice to know instead of wonder ya know?! Anyways... I would definitely recommend reading the book if you're into the show! I plan on reading the book for every season!!!"
4,"Early ""Pitt"", but worth the read","Dirk Pitt is just getting started and his character is a bit rough around the edges, but, as usual its a FUN book to read. I always wonder how Pitt is going to solve the mystery, and, he never fails. If you want a good book to sit on the beach and read on a weekend, this will fill the bill. If you like Cussler, you won't be disappointed."
2,TOO MUCH TALK,"This book started out really good. Out of all the beggining were a ship was destroyed this had the best. AT first i thought that it was just getting off to a slow start. I thought that with all this boring stuff that they would at least put on a great ending action part. I was wrong. This has Giorodino in it for about two secounds, and Dirk Pitt takes forever to fight in the end. I have enjoyed all other Dirk Pitt books that I have read except Raise the Titanic. So Check out the other ones and forget about this one."
4,vixen03,"Typically interesting escapade by Clive Cussler. This was somewhat less believable than most, but good none-the-less. Cusslers older work is more creative and passionate."
2,Not Satisfied,"I got this a few months back because at the time I was fascinated with foxes, and from the reviews, I trusted that this would be really cool. However, when I got it and opened the box, the.. Whole face in general... was entirely inaccurate in anatomy. The eyes were WAY too large, causing it to look.. Well, ugly. The snout doesn't have the small, slender shape of a fox, but more of an angular slant from the head and then a big hard nose that brings even more attention to it. I found that one of the hind legs was a bit longer than the other, and way too under-stuffed.Besides all of this, the fur is very silky and nice, and this is about the only fox plushie I've found with black tips (ears and paws) which is about the only reason I didn't send it back. In all, I really hate it, and do not recommend purchasing it."
4,"fresh food, fresh tastes","She puts red wine in her muffins, and it works. She also has some of the simplest recipes I've seen in print. You have to like someone who doesn't mind setting out a plain six-ingredient recipe that works very well. Other authors would dress it up with all kinds of extra ingredients just to make it unique, but she's not afraid to let simple good ingredients stand on their own."
1,never received this,"I've ordered this twice now and don't know why they don't pull it, because it must have been discontinued"
2,Very Disappointing,"I have not seen a Duran Duran concert ever! Though I grew up a ""Duranie"" in the 80's, I have yet to see them perform their hits live in concert. This DVD (I thought) will finally provide me w/ a sense of satisfaction watching every Duran Duran member live playing their hit songs. I would like to watch Nick ""one finger"" Rhodes play the synth one more time and prove once and for all that this band is not just a glam band but actual artists.This DVD failed me. Every live song was interrupted by snippets of aliens and what have you - and totally ruined the live concert experience.What a joke!"
4,Good Story,"""Whirlwind Wedding"" by Jacquie D'Alessandro. I disagree with two of the reviewers; one that said the characters were cardboard (I didn't find that at all and enjoyed both H&h personalities), and the other reviewer who said the sexual tension was high (while I found it lacking). I did find the story very romantically entertaining and I liked the believeable mystery which wound its way throughout the story. Although I usually don't like magic or fake characters, this heroine did have visions of the future which were written so well, I looked forward to each one. I would have given it 5 stars if the love scenes were more sensual!"
5,Fantastic book!,"I bought this book based on customer reviews and am so glad I did. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it ended.The story features likeable characters and a perfect balance of heat and humour.D'Alessandro is now one of my favourite authors, and based on this book I would buy any romance with her name on it!I don't usually write book reviews, but this was so enjoyable that I wanted to give the author some positive feedback and encourage any undecided readers to purchase the book."
4,Very sweet book. Can I have the brother though?,The main couple are so cute together and the cats' names are hilarious.The second couple were very cute as well.Can I have Robert? It was love a first sight. OMG I love his wit and humor. He seemed like such a sweet person.Book would have deserved a 5 star if not for the dragging part after the misinterpreted vision the heroine had. I really like Jacquie D'Alessandro hero and heroine in most of her books up until about the last 1/3 because she starts adding in some kind of misunderstanding/problems to drag the books out more. This book was much better than Red Roses Mean Love. That one I wanted to whack the hero for the last half of the book.
4,Happy,"The DVD was good quality and didnt have any scratches. It contains the ""deleted scenes"" in the extras menu. The original version that I saw years ago included those scenes in the movie. Over all I am happy with the item."
2,Bad Dvd,"The DVD is defective. It stops about 1/4 into the program, then recycles back to the beginning.Lost return address, so I am just stuck with the bad DVD."
5,Makes me Feel Young Again!,"I always loved the song ""Diamonds and Rust,"" so I play it over and over in the kitchen. Makes me feel nostalgic as she says. Husband and I saw her in concert year before last, and when she started singing THAT song the applause was deafening. Very emotional for me. Reminds me of a guy in my life, now dead, but also a genius with blue eyes and a writer."
5,Her finest hour!,"Joan Baez' Diamonds and Rust is not only one of the finest Folk albums of the '70's, it is one of the best albums released in the '70's and should be considered a classic recording.And she still is making quality music today! Which the critics, VJ's, DJ's, etc... should be aware of!..."
4,Vintage Joan,"The clear crystal voice of Joan Baez. This is a nice album and one of my favorites by her. Sometimes she can be a bit sharp and cold to me but the songs on this album fit her nicely. My favorites include ""Diamonds and Rust"", ""I Never Dreamed You Would Leave In Summer"" and of course ""Jesse"". Maybe she is an acquired taste I am not sure but I do know I have liked her since the late 60's when I started being old enough to appreciate her and the message in most of her songs. I think if you are trying to get your feet wet with Ms. Baez this may be a goog one to start wtih."
4,Great adventure yarn,"Swallowdale refers to a story the children and Captain Flint wrote over the winter... this is it, which accounts for the more fantastical elements some of the other reviewers mentioned! (Missee Lee -- pirates in the South China Sea -- is a story in a similar vein.) Great fun although I do slightly prefer the more ""realistic"" books in the series. But the whole series is great -- I first read Swallows and Amazons at the age of 9 and return to it often."
5,Swallows and Amazons series-how I learned to sail,"I grew up reading these books; I can't imagine going without them. In the 1970's, I had to write to the British publisher to get the one book missing from my father's collection. You're luckier; all you have to do is order them here. You will learn how to sail and how to speak British English. You will revel in simpler things and remember how annoyingly the grownups can try to stop us children from doing what we need to do. You will see strong female role models and learn how to bank a fire to keep it going overnight. You will learn how gypsies mark their trails and how to swim. And you will love every moment and wish there was more. You need theses books!"
3,"No voice, just Lucille","Anyone wanting the short story on the blues can be sent straight to the BB King bins. He had it in the beginning, and just got better, thriving on technology. After a while, you get to really appreciate his guitar and you maybe want no interference, like from voice. This is a great album that way, just Lucille, no voice. Some of the music is quite old and challenged sound-wise, and after a couple of times through this album, you're ready for the whole B experience again.It is worth commenting that the instrumentals on Blues on the Bayou (there are 3 of them) are the best B has done anywhere, anytime that I know of. BB's Theme, the opener, is worth the price of admission on its own. I'll Survive, also on Blues on the Bayou, is B's favourite over the years, he says, although it's vocal. That album is probably his best - a better starting point if you don't have it already."
1,DO NOT BUY!!,What a crappy game. All the other reviews have pretty much spelled out the plethora of problems with it. If you're looking for a good strategy game (what I was hoping for) try Rome: Total War. Don't make my mistake--don't get this game!
1,I could not get through it.,"I once tried to read this book, but I absolutely could not finish it(which is unusual for me!). There were several ridiculous mistakes (For example, Picard calling Riker 'William' several times--just in the first chapter!)."
1,Poor craftsmanship!!!!,When we got it we thought it was great. That was about 2 weeks ago. As of this morning when we lifted the top it came off!!!! I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.
3,Not a Rabid Fan - 3 and 1/2 stars,"I'm not going to give this game a ""raving review"" since I am not a gamer who thinks Metal Gear is better than air but it is one of the best looking ""console-to-PC"" games around. The visuals look great and the controls are easy to use and configure. The actual gameplay is pretty good but it will take time to master this game for novices."
5,more more more,"those three words sum up the pc verson of the popular ps game. the graphics have been souped up with full 3d support. remeber how the ps verson was all grainy and sandy during the movies? well the pc has no problem handling 3d motion so it shines and sparkles clearly going at 60 fps. the story is one of the most elaborate i ever saw in a game and for those who havent played it, play it now! buy it rent it, borrow from friends and burn it i dont care just play this game, you will not be disapointed."
5,Utopia's best,"OK, so I had to wait until the second great Depression to finally purchase this in CD format (I bought the vinyl when it came out in the 70's), but this has to be Utopia's best by far. If you love Todd, you will agree with me on this. He is a true American musical genius of the highest caliber. If you are not a Todd fan and are browsing some of his stuff, start with this one."
2,YUK...! NOT what I expected...,"this stuff does not even RESEMBLE your basic southern-style gumbo...the color, flavor, and texture are not even closeCAUTION: if you don't like mushrooms (and I don't...in fact, no gumbo I have ever had used mushrooms), don't buy this...a heavy, cloying mushroom flavor that stays with you for hours...!"
5,MY SIGNATURE SCENT,"The word ""Ici"" means ""here"" in French. As in...daub a little ""here"" and he nuzzles...daub a little ""HERE"" and he REALLY nuzzles...Ladies, this is the most subtle, long-lasting fragrance...total strangers have approached me and told me how wonderful it is! I've been wearing it for years, and when I moved to Nome, AK, I was HORRIFIED that I would never be able to find it again. I only have one bottle left, so I'll be back. You should try it, but don't order too many...save some for me!"
2,Dumb Story with Nice Artwork,"I bought this mainly on the strength of Coipel's fantastic work in J. Michael Straczinski's run on ""THOR"". Unfortunately this story and accompanying artwork didn't come anywhere close to my expectations.I think Bendis' main strength (and what makes him beloved by Marvel) is his uncanny ability to create scenes (however improbable) that incorporate a ridiculous number of heroes and villains from the Marvel pantheon, which artists can later render into a graphic worthy of any geeky eight year old's bedspread / comforter or wall adornment. As far as telling a compelling story, in an interesting way, his work isn't much more impressive than the story lines of the 1960's Batman TV series.(So, no, I won't be tuning-in for more...same BENDIS-time, same BENDIS-drivel!!!)I'd happily trade this with anyone for more of Straczinski's work, however... :)"
2,difficult to read,I wanted to read a contemporary book about General Marion. This is an interesting book but was written in 1844. It is undoubtedly accurate but I found it difficult to read for a nonhistorian.
5,The shoes are great,"I personallyu play soccer with the white pair of the Beck designed ones. They are comfortable and very useful for curve shots. The pricing, shipping and handling are convenient and easy. I recommend this seller."
3,Demonia Pleaser Boots.,"I liked the boots, they fit comfortably. However after wearing them a few tims one of the lace hooks broke loose. Still wearable though, and I enjoy my boots alot."
3,Fast service!,"I havent actually used this book yet for my class, but it arrived very quickly, and in perfect condition. It's a very cute, small book and it's a great size to fit in a purse. I'm sure that when I do actually start using this book it will be very helpful!"
4,Good grammar review,"This is a comprehensive, well wrtitten review of grammar and usage, I always have isssues with my sentences and this book helped me write a better paper."
1,Needed Better Editing!,"I found this book virtually unreadable. It was filled with Creative Writing 101 clunkers. For example, the lead character sets up the back story by ""reminding herself"" of things, ""lecturing herself"" about things, ""scolding herself"" about things, etc. etc. Characters rarely say things - they ""continue,"" ""snap,"" ""rejoin,"" ""whisper,"" ""recall,"" ""protest,""sigh,"" ""correct,"" venture,"" ""observe"" ""advise"" ""announce"" ""repeat""- well, you get the idea. Stomachs lurch and eyes leak. I'm sure the author worked very hard - where was her editor?"
5,MM2 -- Watch it kill everything in its path,"Whoa. Microsoft scoooooored. Midtown Madness 2 is better than the original simply because of all the possiblities. You can just Cruise around each city (Trust me, you'll do this for HOURS, I know I [literally] did), play games with yourself in Cruise mode like ""Cop Killa"" where you hafta get the feds off you tail (NOT a game mode, just something I like to do sometimes), countless race styles and types, mess around with multiplayer on the Zone, play an unlimited number of different kinds of online games (Cops & Robbers, Roof Warz! [the latter is not a game mode]), download some mods and new levels, go online with those and challenge and confuse buddies, battle it out on top of bridges...it just keeps going. Did I mention that some people make their own cars and mods, and you can too? Um, shouldn't you be buying this already?"
5,Training to be a London Cabbie...anyone....anyone?,"This is one of the best games I have ever played, certainly at least for the computer. The crazy driving action, yet realistic movement and sound gives this game one of the most realistic driving experiences you'll ever experience. If you were able to get out of your car you could call this the literal game of ""life"".......just remember not to repeat the stunts, it's just a game ^_^"
4,Innovative and never boring,"Okay, I want to set this straight: this game is fun and never boring. The replayablilty value is very high, especially in cruise. This game is also incredibly detailed, which I like. There are a few minor problems with this game: First, the AI is not that good. Computer-controlled traffic cars do not stop in cruise mode unless you are exactly line up in the traffic lane. Most of the time, they act as if you weren't even there. This gets annoying sometimes. Second, bugs occasionally pop up in the form of graphic glitches and lockups. These are rare, but take away from some of the believebilaty of this game. Other than these minor problems, I think that this game is a good buy for anyone who enjoys to drive the way they can't in real life."
2,The Graphics Ruined it for me,"Well to start off the graphics are terrible. There so boxy and have no detail whatsover, even when i run it on the highest resolution. The controls are nice, but the gameplay sux. I want to just wanted to drive and mess around in the city, but right when i push the gas the cop gets on me for no reason which get's really annoying after about....10 seconds. And the street lights don't work correctly, when the light turns green the cars don't always go. If you like games that are boring and full of many errors that could have been easily avoided, then i guess you like this game"
1,you guys are nuts,i wasnt gonna write a review but after i saw how many people gave 5' to this game i had too. this game ... if you like car games dont buy this one this an't a car game at. all it has is cool cars but they dont drive like cars and the object of the game is stupid. you can knock over almost anything and the bullet holes in your car window im not gonna say no more its a waste of my time. if you wanna a game like this but better and you have ps2 just get midnightclub same thing but way better.
3,ok,"Really enjoyed this classic FPS. Hardcore gamers wont be disappointed. i highly recommend purchasing. Graphics are great, story-line is solid (and not so short) , audio is excellent and the price is right."
1,"""dumbhead""","My daughter loves Berenstein bears book and never seems to get enough of it. I understand the ideas trying to convey in this book but I don't appreciate some wording, especially when Sister bear called Brother bear ""dumbhead"" when she was mad at him. My daughter picks it up just like that and we are trying to get this word out of her head. So, be aware when you decide to read this book."
3,Not as Good as Paris!,The first 'under the groove' (Paris) was a considerably tighter and consistent collection; the first half of the San Francisco selections were better than the second.
1,Wood Suggestion Box,"The only thing good about this product was the hardware, we threw the box away. Trash, covered with loose paper."
3,Good for those who have no clue what Coptic Christianity is,"The book is good for giving a lot of information about the Coptic Orthodox church, but the author doesn't give the church enough credit for its role in ancient and modern Christianity. I don't think its a book the Coptic Church will promote."
2,good research but hard to read,I found this book very difficult to sit and read. It seems to be a great reference book but the style is dull and I end up taking a nap after I read it. It is good to have by your nightstand.
4,Great content............but,"This book provides a very good in-depth introduction to the subjects of hypnosis, NLP visualisation , etc. It is aimed at the individual looking for techniques to enable positive change and the professional seeking to expand his knowledge / options. The author succeeds in this respect , however the text is spoilt by the incessant use of ""or she"" ""or her"" ""or herself"". This is unnecessary and ultimately became an irritating distraction from a free flowing read."
5,Nikon D40X,Fantastic Item. Bought both lenses and you must purchase a card as well. Great features!!!
2,What A Mess...,"What a mess this is... This ""darkly intoxicating brew"" (The Guardian) picks up the story of young a young Scottish lass (see his debut, ""Morvern Callar"") as she returns from the continent. She comes to a wee little island where honeymooners stay at a weird hotel, and there's a cast of supporting bizarros. Really tough to get through and none too rewarding despite occasionally clever language at times. Warner's got talent, but try his much more accesible ""The Sopranos"" before trying this."
3,Great for one year......,"I bought this one year ago and it made great coffee.Good, hot and great tasting. Now, however it perks find but does not stay hot. Also I don't like the looks at the perk section of the pot...it is black and crudy looking. Apparently that is not stainless steel."
5,It keeps on percolating.,"I've had this Percolator for several years. It's great and very fast. I lost the plug-in due to a recent move and had no trouble at all replacing it. Hamilton Beach also sent me a list of all the replacement parts available for this Model 40616 - should I need them at a later date. My coffee stays hot and fresh and never scorched. If I ever have to replace it (which I doubt), I'll get the exact replacement. It's the best coffee maker I've ever had. Sincerely,Carol Markham, Texas"
4,A Good Work of Fiction,"This was the first time I read Diehl,s work. I thought it was suspenseful and it kept my interest. The author left a lot of room for a sequel. It is worth the time."
2,Just okay.,"I've eaten a lot of protein bars and this one isn't any different. Very dry and not very good tasting, but it does fill you up. I just keep telling myself how good it is for me."
3,Marti's review,"This is Shelby and Nevada's story. Shelby returns home after many years because someone sent her a picture with a note telling her that the child she thought died at birth is really alive... Although the story had some good moments, I felt some of the plot was not really realistic and didn't flow for me. Shelby's attitude was sometimes cavalier about Ross, and the danger he represented. I like Ms Jackon's work as a rule, but with this book I was somewhat dissapointed."
3,Good book,I enjoy trade books. The help fill a rainy day. I have more time to read since I have retired
5,Very Great Story,"I discovered Lisa Jackson years ago and I read this novel the first time it was printed. Beware, this is not a new story, but a re-print of one of her older novels. I knew this when I bought it, but I purchased it anyway as I loved it then and I love it now. Sometimes re-visiting an old novel is like seeing an old friend again.The story was great! There was plenty of suspense and believe it or not I could not remember who the killer was! The romance was great too and I loved the character Navada. Lisa's story telling has changed over the years and her newer novels seem to involve more mystery and suspense, with less romance than her older novels possessed. Oh, but this is not a complaint! Her new novels are great also, but there are times I miss the sexier men she used to write about. So I find myself returning to re-visit time and time again.I would reccommend this novel to anyone who loves to read romantic suspense! She won't let you down!!!"
3,Good but too much sex.,The book had a great plot and the characters were good but the story got placed second to the sex . Sometimes less is better.
3,disappointed,"I rated this novel 3 stars, but it is about 2 1/2. I love Lisa Jackson's novels, but this was a disappointment. It was even more disappointing to find out that this novel was actually an earlier novel she wrote, but updated and some of the names changed. You could tell this was probably one of her early works, as it just wasn't on the same level as her most recent novels, like the Montoya/Benz series and the Alvarez/(?forgot the other name) series. In this story there was the usual murder, the rich girl wronged, the guy from the wrong side of the tracks, etc. But the story lacked depth and suspense that her more recent novels have."
1,stinks,"I won't take up much space to register my complete disgust with this book. Others in the one star section have it right. With the first ""yep"" by one of the characters I realized that I was going to have to read westernise throughout. Then we have the occasional one word of Spanish followed by a translation every time.I could go on and on. The book jacket was the best part of the book."
3,unspoken by Lisa Jackson,Unspoken was a quick read. I found the characters in the book interesting and I always like a book that has a happy ending. This was more of a romance novel with a little mystery and not as violent as many of Lisa's books. So those that like romance will enjoy this book.
2,eh,This book definitely wasn't one of my Lisa Jackson's favorite. I am not fond of female characters who have to prove how strong they are and don't need anyone but instead of strong they come of as more annoying. this character was the most annoying of them all with her attitude. it's reads like a corny soap opera and i find myself jsut wanting to get through it and over with.
3,A good story,"This is a mystery and romance story that is nice escape reading. You know from the beginning which two characters will end up together at the end and it does not take long to figure out ""who did the killing"" but...you have to wait till almost the end to find out who really did the killing. At least I did. My choice was totally wrong."
3,A slow British spy movie,It is movies like this that makeThe Man from St. Petersburg (Signet)seem contrived. Once you add British Royaltyto the spy picture seems like things get very cloudy?Any other man but Antony Blunt would have been hanged for being the spy he was for a very long period.It isn't a big secret that the British-Soviet connection was the intermediate that got the A-bomb plans to the Russians in the 40's.Some people think that the cold war competition was good for western culture.The funny thing about British homosexuals working for the Soviets is that the Russian system was much harder on such behaviors than the British ever were. There isn't a big secret about the British [........] problem?!Men kissing an a movie does come as sort of a shock.It seems that Antony Blunt was sort of the Royal fairy...
5,Great expansion,The conquerers expansion adds to the already great game Age of kings. I still play this now even though the graphics are outdated.
1,Doesn't Work,"Won't work on my computer (Win XP Pro). OS, video drivers, directX and game are all up to date. Crashes when I start it. Can't make it work under Wine on Linux either."
3,What's so new???,"I have played Ages of Empire II: The Age of Kings, over and over again. I was getting kind of bored with it so I thought the expansion would be great. What's so new??? Not much that I could see. I'm the non-conquerer type who likes to get the relics or the wonder so I found nothing new. Definately nothing worth paying for the expansion. Maybe if you are a battle kind of player it might be different."
3,About that load time--,"I'll keep this short! I found the game unplayable on a P350, 64 MEG of memory. Great graphics, unbearable load times--Network play was great (person to person, not via the zone).I recently borrowed a p750, GeForce2 with 256 meg of memory. What a dream! The game works well, most of the loading issues go away. It's just...considering what they list as their min. requirements. I say 3 stars."
4,Fantastic !,"This is one awesome game ! Beautiful graphics, very nice cloud and haze effects. Unlike FS98 or FS2000, you don't need to master your piloting skills. Very playable.But, I have a PIII 800MHz, GeForce 32M card... Slow load times, once it loads, no slowing down. On another 300 MHz machine I have, it takes 5 mins to load and has a low frame rate."
5,Road Trip!,We are always looking for something different to see and do when in California. Interesting book with some places we want to visit next time we go there. Would recommend.
5,A perfect ending to the series.,"I have been a devoted fan of L.M. Montgomery ever since I was a little girl. My favorites included the classic Anne books but a few years ago I stumbled upon the Emily series. Curious, I began reading those too. However, I only recently ran across a copy of Emily's Quest. While this book was slightly darker than its prequels, I think that I would have to choose it as my favorite. The trials of being young and in love make it the perfect ending to a wonderful series of books."
2,dissapointed,"I loved Anne Shirley and all her children and thought I had fallen in love with Emily. However, I thought Montgomery's style in this book was tiresome and choppy. The ending seemed abruptly short and difficult to read. About three-fourths of the way threw I almost refused to read anymore. I didn't like the journaling style of throwing in roman numerals between thoughts. I miss Montgomery's style that was evident in Anne, Rilla and the first Emily. I was disapointed to follow these characters all this way and have it end like this."
4,The Lonesome Jubilee,"John really put it all together on this one, songwriting, musicianship, he definitely paints great pictures with his music and words.All the songs have a catchy hook and cool story behind them. He cleverly uses a lot of different instruments that are not normally use on rock records.The whole album stays on that rural midwestern theme, but don't let that fool you, all of the songs on this album are anywhere from 3-5 star in quality. Recordings highlights, Paper and fire -- Cherry Bomb etc. great stuff"
4,Simply Money is easier to use than Quicken or Microsoft Mone,"Simply Money is easier to use than Quicken or Microsoft Money. If you don't want intergalactic, this is the program for you.Works fine on XP for me. Read the other reviews; Simply Money is sold by Simply Media that has 40 or so titles. You can get tech support at simplymedia.com, under tech support. They have posted a free updated manual (searchable; printable; free) and a Quick Start Guide.The new version has both the Quick Start Guide and the Manual on the CD.So if you want to do checks and things like that, this is perfect. If you want intergalactic, do Quicken or MM."
4,A greate read,"This was one of the first war ace biographies I've ever read, back when I was fourteen.It's a pleasure to see it published again, to replace my old copy.Of course, Mr. Brickhill seems to be a huge fan of Bader, but who in England is not, even those who realize that Bader had a difficult temper, but a difficult temper that was responsibels for getting back in a warplane in war tiem RAF without both legs!Good read, a classic."
5,Not for button pushers- a pro course for newcomers!,"I'm a working professional editor. I read Tom's first edition. I was blown away by the expert mix of how-to and why edits work which can only come from a veteran master editor who is also a teacher. This is the book that gives you everything needed to learn the application and the principles of editing form, structure, pacing, music-- wisdom you don't get from a dry software-only book. Tom layers in all the FCP operations-- appearing just where they should! It's an exceedingly robust work. You can spend well-structured time with it, as I did, practice the designed edit exercises with the supplied CD along with your keyboard chops from the included KeyGuide. Both editing skill and software know-how come together here in a dawning experience. In my view, it's either this, or a semester in film school containing separate classes on editing theory, editing practice, and a solid FCP course to boot!"
1,Not what I expected,"To be fair, I didn't get through this whole book. But from what I did read, this book should have been entitled, ""Why Catholics Think Premarital Sex is Bad"" and maybe subtitled ""Catholic Girls Shouldn't Date Jerks"". I was looking for a book about creating a spiritual relationship when your partner is non-Catholic, but I found that this book wasn't about spirituality, it was more about Church doctrine. I was very disappointed because this book focuses on one underlying theme of sexuality and I was hoping for something more dynamic."
2,Borderline and Silly.,"This is the debut album from Dru Hill, who name themselves after Druid Hill in Baltimore, Maryland. The lead singer is the exceedingly flamboyant Sisqo, an otherwise talented vocalist. While this album never lacks attitude or spark, the songs, though not disastrous, are subpar and predictable slices of radio-friendly r&b. The hit single, ""Tell Me,"" is a slow jam that qualifies as a guilty pleasure, despite its banal lyrics which attempt to rival Jodeci in the raunch department. For the rest of the ride, these guys don't really bring anything new or exciting to the table of r&b. If you're 14 and haven't listened to a note of soul music prior to 1990, then this CD will be your cup of tea. But for the mature and discriminating audience, we will have to get something else."
1,Never received order,"I never received my order.I contacted the seller and didn't get a response or anything,I will not purchase anything from this seller again."
5,The best new R&B group since Boyz II Men,"This is a superb album. Every song is at least decent, and most of them are great. I highly recommend it to every R&B fan."
4,Buy this album,"Ignore the editorial review.Every album has to evolve and Redd Kross accomplished that with Show World, while still keeping the harmonic sound that is distinctively Redd Kross, particular case in point ""Mess Around"".Other great tracks to listen to ""Stoned"", ""One Chord Progression"", ""You Lied Again"".Thousands of bands pay homage to The Beatles, but Redd Kross displays the best influence to date, while adding their own talents to make a delicious dish that is the VERY underrated REDD KROSS."
3,Hearing Enhancement,I didn't expect much for the price and was pleasantly surprised that it worked. I use it for watching TV and it allows me to keep the volume down to a level my wife is comfortable with.SSI 1 Bud Hearing Enhancement with Tone Control (Batteries Included)
5,Good Value,"The adhesive is better than similar envelopes that cost almost a dollar each at brick and mortar stores.The padding isn't quite as good as others I have seen. It feels fairly thin and stiff, but it still works great for my purposes.I will buy these again."
3,A good book but lacks action.,If you like action and adventure DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!! If you are not into action and adventure but still like the Pern trilogy this will be a good book to read.
1,No! I'm melting!,"Whatever you do, RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO READ THIS BOOK! It should be removed from the McCaffrey lineup by the publisher, it was so bad. A bunch of crappy characters, some of McCaffrey's most inattentive writing (and some of the latter-day Pern books are LAME, let's admit it), and a bunch of British class-warfare themes that the rest of us don't care about. Skip it."
1,A poor revisitation of the White Dragon,"I found this book a complete and total dissapointment. It had very little in the way of original material, mostly just containing a recap of The White Dragon. I was very surprised and dismayed at this fact, and feel it is well below McCaffrey's writing ability"
5,Excellent!,"This book is very comprehensive. It provides ALL the tools a teacher, professor, instuctor needs to teach a class effectively and with confidence. I highly recommend it."
4,"Big book, Small price","I bought a book for a class I didn't want to take, it was nice buying a book that wasn't expensive."
3,Great.,"Ecletic,powerfull, emotional songs. Something most people don't understand. This is a record that shows U2 at their worst (Discotheque, Miami) and at the peak of their powers (Do You Feel Loved, Gone, Please, Staring at the Sun). Pop is not for the casual U2 fan, but if you invest time listening to it, you'll find it's a good album, but the best songs off it are great."
2,"alright album, but compared to ""Achtung Baby""......","It would be an alright album, if they same band haven't made the masterpiece of them all ""Achtung Baby"". It makes ""Pop"" look....boring and without soul of music. The best songs are ""If god would..."" and ""Staring at the sun"" + ""Discotheque"" is a great song before going out friday night. But, Bono still writes great lyrics. On the other hand, nothing is worthy to follow up on ""Achtung Baby""."
3,Parental Advisory,"Some good tunes, but I don't understand why there is no Parental Advisory label for when Bono drops the F-bomb during ""Wake Up Dead Man."" Are they so big they don't require a label that would have been printed on a rapper's cover? Beyond that, I don't understand why he thought it necessary to say that in a Christian song by a Christian band to begin with. I would give it 4 stars minus that."
4,Extremely Strong Album,"Though many of U2's fence sitting fans jumped ship for this album, they may want to take another look at U2's artistic stab at the lighter side. In fact, this album really does stack favorably to it's more heralded immediate siblings. The younger, All that you can't leave behind, is a fantastic back to basics tug on the reigns but it is not the album that Pop is. the older, Zooropa is also fine but a little too directionally challenged for my liking. Is Pop another Actung or Joshua Tree? No, but nothing ever will be. Enjoy Pop for all of it's own personal greatness. You won't regret it"
3,U2's marriage of rock and techno should end in divorce!,"U2's flirtations with electronica were new and exciting on Achtung Baby and Zooropa, but the band's full-blown commitment to the genre on POP proves that marriage can take some of the thrill out of any good relationship. While there are certainly a few high points on the CD (Discotheque, Do You Feel Loved, mofo), POP leaves me a little cold."
3,okay,"Never really liked this album. But there are some good songs here including ""Gone"", ""please"", ""if god will send his angels"", ""wake up dead man"" and ""staring at the sun"". But I can't play discoteque without out laughing. And I am forced to skip over ""the playboy mansion"", ""miami"", ""do you feel loved"". Lot of better albums out there."
5,U2s most impressive album.,"Where do you start.Very diverse album, not one song alike.U2 reinvented themselves with this album and they sound just brilliant.U2s last great album."
4,"Great album, but U2 is best with October, Joshua Tree","This album is a deep thought on many things: love, sex, death, life, the great beyond, Miami, and especially a song for Bono's own deceased mother (Mofo). I enjoy it very much, I believe it is a great testimony to a band being able to have pop beats, techno, and depth all in one. (Saying this in lieu of - - and this is personal opinion - - Backstreet Boys, N'Sync, Britney Spears, etc.) I would listen to U2 and any style they put out any day, as long as they always have the depth they have always had. I'm greatly looking forward to the 2000 album All That You Can't Leave Behind, and the return of rock 'n' roll U2."
1,"wow, this is f$ck$ng hilarious, goes right in the trashcan..","wow, a 100 pound p%ssy and a crew called Murda Inc., you've got to be kidding, didn't he grow up in the suburbs, kids got some balls, well this album as well as all his others goes straight in the trash along with 50 cent, jay-z and all the other posers in the hip hop scene, going on TRL and pretending to be gangsters, so funny, this p#ssy needs to get his ass kicked severely, and then see what he thinks of thug life, just don't buy this crap and focus your interests on Ghostface ""Supreme Clientele"", and the Rza, and Wu tang, and even some Nas, where there are great stories to be told as well as lessons to be learned, real hip hop, even Mos Def and Talib Kweli, but Murda Inc and all these phonies should get clapped back son, word up. I wouldn't even take a crap on this cd."
1,worthless,"ja is just in it for the money, he will do whatever people want to hear. He is fake and his songs are about as good as his acting, how he got this far I will never know. CD is short because he has nothing to say"
3,Just full of 50 Cent disses,"This is all on 50 Cent and at time works.This was his last album until the just released R.U.L.E.Here it goes people the top tracks and some commentary of them.""Life"" a good diss of 50 I like this one.""Clap back"" was somewhat of a big disapointment for Ja Rule.""Crown"" a good beat for the ocation.""Race against time II"" is a nice song that works well.""N***** & B*****"" has a good beat.""Blood in my Eye"" sounds like he is Freestyling.""Its murda"" is a freestyle over a nice beat actually pretty good.""Wrap"" has nice Lyrics but he does not fit well with Mobb Deep's Burn that much.This album is a dissapointment compared to the better lyrics and beats on the Last Temptation.It was rushed together to fast.Lyrics 6 Production 6 X Factor 7 Classic 6 Replay 5Total=6 out of 10 Fingers end result 3 Mics1.Race against time II2.Its murda3.Life4.Crown5.Blood in my Eye"
2,Okay,"but why does everyone wanna be gangsta's 50 aint ja aint only gangsta that are commercial are beanie sigel and such and why does 50 make the same records as ja when he says that he makes pop records 21 question and wanna get to know you are the popest records even britney spears would be disturb with it worth a look but did this go gold?????? ja has no skills at all but 50 aint better!Favorite Track:The WrapGuest:Black Child,Cadillac Tah,Fatal Hussein5 of 10 lyrics 5 of 10 beats"
2,Apparently He Has Blood In His Ears Too (2.5 Stars),"This CD is good for one thing......beats. The beats are hot, but the Rule is not. The album is only 45 minutes long and he spends 40 of those minutes talking about 50 Cent. For those of you that get caught up in silly things like ""beef"" (a.k.a. ""tactless marketing that boosts sales""), or if you want to listen to Ja whine for 45 minutes about being shoved from the spotlight, then this album is for you. If you're looking for good music, then look elsewhere. Like I said before, the beats are hot, but that's all this CD is good for. If you can download it for free, then do so. But if you're going to buy it, get a used copy and don't pay more than $5.00 for it either. The only reason I even bothered is because I'm a DJ and people wanted to hear ""Clap Back"" in the club. But I borrowed it from a friend. Even I wasn't silly enough to put any dollars on it.Personal Favorites: ""Clap Back"" and ""Crown""....there really isn't much else there."
2,WORST ALBUM BY HIM! FLAT! INSULTING!,"I think that this is the worst album that Ja Rule has made. He could have taken more effort to have made it better. His attacks at 50 Cent come off as cheap, cold, insulting, heartless, and downright hysterical. He could have used his talents to rap about something else on this album. And as for the music, it sounds lame, some of the songs don't make me get up and dance to them and they sound like rejects from other Murder Inc. artists. His sing-song rap style is missing on most of the songs. And his attacks at 50 Cent tend to go overboard--is he THAT angry? He seem to be angry on most of the songs. Right now 50 is one of the hottest rappers now--Ja needs to accept that and this album just doesn't do it for me. It sounds rushed and he needs to reevalutate his music career if he wants to continue!"
4,Ja rules awsome,"Ja rule keeps it real, 50 cent is just a hater. Theres nothing else to say... anyway this cd was pretty good, if you like ja rule go get it"
1,Grand champ is betta,Get dark man exz new joint. Its called grand champ. Get that instead of this garbage.and this is clean. No dirty dancing darkness.
2,G-G-G-G- UNIT!,Clap back is the only good track on this disc. Go cop the black album by jay z or beg for mercy. The g unit cd is alright but its better than this crap.
1,Blood In My Eye makes a great coaster for your coffee table.,"Why does he bother battling with Shady/Aftermath? It's useless, he's been beaten up and he might as well just admit that he lost the battle. It's so sad seeing him try to get back at the most powerful people (Shady/Aftermath) in hip-hop right now. It's like bringing a knife to a gunfight. Oh that line was taken already. Anyways, I give this album 1 star because I wanna piss off the Ja Rule fans who give everything he does 5 stars. If I could give this album a zero I would. Who the hell still listens to this loser anyway? It won't be long before he joins Vanilla Ice as the lamest rapper of all time. I know alot of people are gonna say this review wasn't helpful but you know what? I don't care! Deep down y'all know Ja sucks. BTW< this is 50 and Free Yayo!!!"
1,IT'S A MONSTER!!!!!!!!!,"I can't decide who's worse, this guy or 50 cent. What's his claim to fame? Did he get stabbed 20 times, or maybe run over by a car 10 times. The voice sounds like something out of a horror movie!!(that's it, maybe he got shot in the throat!!!)I don't understand what's going on in hip hop, the music just doesn't do it anymore. This isn't entertaining, it's just plain annoying. My friend brought this c.d. over and played it, I almost threw him out of my house for bringing this crap in. It's time people started following the leads of musicians such as Outkast, Micheal Franti, The Roots, Snoop Dog and Black-eyed Peas and stop making this poor excuse for hip-hop or whattever you call this horrible stuff. Is he bragging about being a gangster too?? PATHETIC!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Ja gets some props for this one.,"I was never a big fan of Ja, never bought any of his albums, I couldn't give a damn about Irv Gotti, and I have no respect for Benzino ( oh wait who the hell is he again) but Ja KILLED IT ON THIS ONE. I've got respect for aftermath and G-unit as a matter of fact I think Ja is a pu**y like 50 said, but its all industry sh*t, 50 is doing the same thing ja used to do and is slowly becoming a softie, but no one has the balls to say it."
2,Besides The Beef.,"I am not speaking on the beef that Ja got with you know who. I am speaking on this album based on it's merit and it sucks. I mean the beats, the rhymes and the guest. I never thought that I would say this, but I rather him sing with Bobby Brown with Thug Lovin' II than here this album (not sayin' he should!!!). His first album was a great direction of where he should have kept going. He's better than this album but what he did was prove everybody right. You lose your battle with this album and it's no one's fault but your own. I still think that there's a rapper in you somewhere, you just need to not include all these cats and find it before you hit ""Where Are They Now?""."
2,Stop Focusing on 50!,"On his thank you's Ja should put 50 Cent in bold letters I mean come on 50 may have 1 or 2 songs on his cd talking about Ja but Ja decided to do a whole album and the sad thing is its not that great. Im feeling the crown, and clap back but after that you really get tired of the 50 bashing and the Outlaw Immortals voices. And if your gonna diss someone make it somewhat entertaining like LL Cool J and 2pac and even 50 Cent did with catchy hooks and funny blows dont just call the guy a wanksta snitch 6 different times. Ja needs to step his game back up to his first 2 cds."
1,screw 50 & Ja,"Neither 50 or Ja can even compete with the king of Queens bridge, Cormega. Nas cant even compete either if you listen to the records Mega ripped Nas harder than any one in the 50/Ja beef both of these guys sold out a long a** time ago and Yayo is the only good G-Unit member rappin. Black Child sucks too!"
1,"O God, u gotta Be kidding","I admit that i'm the slightest bit biest due to the fact that i cant stand anyone who tries to knock Dre, Em, and or anyone in Shady Aftermath or G-unit. But i cant stand this cookie monster, and his 2nd hand lyrics. Ja cant flow, hes lucky he can get up and go after fifty pulled his skirt up. sorry if u hate my opinion on the matter but ja sucks(not just his lyrics). Seeing ppl get sucked in by this 2 dollar migit pisses me off. All in all i hate every song cept maybe race against time or watever and dont get this cd if u have any loyalty to anyone at Shady aftermath....P.s. who the hell r u, get ya facts str8, its Aftermath and against the murder finks""they couldnt even murder ink"""
4,ja has the crown,"ja rule does his thing on this album with songs like things goin change, crown ,clap black and the life every hip-hop fan should get this hardcore album all the songs are hot."
4,Would you go through hell for a dog?,"Mr. Katz captures the disruption that a high-strung working dog can bring into your life--and the commitment that it takes to build a relationship with such a dog. As I read this book, I had the same feeling that I did reading ""Winterdance""--that despite how well the book was written, you could really only understand what the writer was talking about if you had gone through it yourself.Well, I haven't run the Iditarod, but I do have two border collies. Mine are less stress, but I know what Mr. Katz went through with Devon and Homer--it is a fun, sometimes wrenching read, but living the reality is a lot harder. Read this book if you are thinking about getting a border collie--then think again, if you have the patience and the time and the will for such a demanding creature--lots of other smart breeds that are a lot easier to deal with."
1,A Dog Year,"Jon Katz has a ""potty mouth""! He uses swear words that add nothing to the story. It only serves to offend his readers. I will never buy another book by this author. He's actually a pretty good author. Too bad he can't keep it clean."
2,Dissapointed!!,"I just discovered Mr.Katz's books and started with the Bedlam Farm book which I thought was good.(NOBODY DIES IN THAT BOOK). There were mentions of labs in that book so I got A DOG YEAR next....I am just so shocked and angry that someone would put a dog to sleep that they loved so much just because it was getting old. I have a 10 year old pug with her share of health issues which bring me to the vet sometimes on a weekly basis and I could not even dream of putting her ""TO SLEEP"" because of it....I had all his other books and the new one on my list of books to get and I think I will pass on those after reading this one and the other reviews of A GOOD DOG where someone else meets the same fate. Poor Stanley."
2,Put me down on the side of those who are unimpressed,"Others have written many of the same words I would have used so I will be brief. I grabbed this book based on a mention from John Grogan in the Marley book. Katz is not nearly as pure of a dog owner. He seems to take pleasure in recounting his practiced dominance over his dogs. He claims to adore them but uses force and physical punishment while explaining how lucky they are to have him. In my mind, the dogs seem like experiments. This book is more about Katz than it is about the dogs. A lot of ego on display. I didn't come away with warm regard for the author."
1,A bad example,"I simply can't understand why people like this book. Probably it just serves as a justification of their own clueless ways to deal with dogs.The man is just reckless, his ""training"" methods are borderline animal abuse and I despise him for pretending his dog was a service dog (ok, the author even doesn't know the difference between service and therapy dog) in order to ""take him places"".I don't care about his writing style, the book is just embarrassing."
1,Anyone who says this is better than the film is a moron.,"One of the things that made Gilliam's film great was Johnny Depp's brilliant, energetic reading of some of the key passages of the unique, musical language of the book. This CD was made by cheap hacks who have probably never even heard Thompson's voice. More importantly, they just don't understand the language. Depp is a professional who spent a lot of time with the author trying to lock on to his manerisms and unique vernacular. The two actually became freinds. These geeks have a minimal understanding of the book or the madness it came out of. They in no way do it justice."
4,Feverfew,"My girlfriend started taking Feverfew to prevent migraines. So far, she has taken it 3 times and the migraine symptoms went away, the migraine was curved."
5,Prevents Migraine Headache.,"Prevents and stops migraine headaches. Even headaches preceeded by parital blindness, flashing lights, memory problems...; these effects will be stopped or shortened, lessened. Side effects, for some people; littlt joint and muscle stiffness, pain a few days after; do not do heavy lifting... for a few days after taking feverfew or you can tear a muscle."
4,Works,As a migraine sufferer it does help. It's just another tool in your toolbelt to battle through the pain associated with mirgranes.
4,cheap heater,"easy use, heating quickly, a little plastic smell firstly. if the wire can be separated from bottom will be much better."
3,Decent for the money,"As a cheap kettle, it's fine. A few comments:--I've certainly owned faster kettles. It's still faster and more convenient than a pot on the stove, though.--As noted by other reviewers, the lid has to be closed for the auto shutoff to work. (This is not a bad safety practice, though.)--There's a stupid little mesh filter in the spout that falls out easily. On the other hand, I'm really not sure what the filter is supposed to accomplish.--Every other Proctor Silex product that I've owned has failed after a few years. This suggests that it would be smarter to pay more money for a better brand, but I've had equally dismal experiences with better brands (Sony and Cuisinart come to mind, though I don't think either of them make kettles or toasters.)"
2,it's got a very short cord,This little kettle has less than a 2 foot cord. Hard to place in most spaces with a cord that short.
3,Electric kettle,"I bought this to boil water for morning coffee. It is convenient: boils water rapidly and shuts off when water comes to a boil. The problem is the plastic smell and now the plastic taste. Others had mentioned this in their reviews, but I dismissed it as over-fastidiousness. When I first received the kettle there was a plastic smell to it. I thought it would go away. Not only is the smell still there, but after a few weeks of use, there is a distinct plastic taste to the coffee now. Live and learn. Stainless steel is the way to go."
5,Incredible value!,"I just had to give the kettle 5 stars for the price and quality. I've had mine for 2 years now and never had a problem. It reaches a boil in less than 5 min. (more like 2 - 3 min.) and stays hot for a good 10 - 15 min. after the automatic shut-off. We use it for instant oatmeal, tea, hot chocolate and any recipes that call for boiling water. It's so cute, we keep it on our breakfast table even when we're not using it. I don't understand the complaints about the plastic taste, maybe my tastebuds just aren't sophisticated but all I taste is no taste which is pretty much what I am looking for in boiled water! I'd say give it a try."
3,"Proctor Silex, fast heat, flawed handle","This kettle did exactly what it was supposed to do. Heats water quickly and is easy to use. My only issue was the way the handle is attached to the lid is not the best. The plastic handle is attached on each side with screws and if it is over-tightened it can crack, break the plastic and the handle can lift off. This could be a safety concern if the kettle is full of hot water when the handle breaks. I was able to heat one kettle full of water before I realized why the handle felt so loose, one side was completely cracked through the plastic. Amazon was great at processing the return, I packed it up, dropped it at the shippers and received my credit. I think I will be looking for a metal kettle now instead of plastic, it will be safer."
5,A Great Product,"I bought the electric kettle to use in my dorm room, and it is doing great. It was a good bit cheaper than some of the other ones, but you do lose a little bit of power with the price difference, but nonetheless, it is a great kettle. The automatic off feature is helpful and works well. After you heat the water, it stays warm inside the kettle for a good amount of time. The kettle doesn't get too hot, so you don't have to worry about burning your hand when trying to pour. Overall, a great product for a very good price."
1,Piece of junk,"You get what you pay for, and I should have known better. Do not make the same mistake I did by buying this piece of junk that is unworthy even of a dorm room. I bought it so we wouldn't be using our microwave all the time, come to find that: if you start with cold water, it takes about 10 minutes to heat up, all the while making enough noise to raise the dead. An old fashioned tea-kettle on the stove is far better, and doesn't have the same awful taste. Buyer please beware!"
2,Flimsy,This electric kettle does heat water. It does have an automatic shut off. It is cheap.It is ugly. The top is hard to open. A filter on the top broke after 3-4 uses. The cord is too short.
4,Good for the price,It works fine. I use it in my office. My only complain will be that the cord is too short.
5,great quality,"I have been using this heater for a year. Thought the size is small, but the quality is very good. So far I have no problem with it."
1,disappointed,It takes a very long time till the water is finally boiling (I had other cheap kettles before and they were much faster). It is also very annoying that you always have to unplug the cable to fill up the kettle with water. I actually regret that I bought it and I do not recommend this product!
1,Bad quality kettle,I just bought it. It is broken after the 1st day of usage. What should I do with it now? Return to Amazon? It takes a lot of my time to return to amazon and has to wait another week for a new one. The quality is the same I guess.
4,Good deal,"The design of this kettle is simple and nice, and despite it's compact size it boils just enough water. I must mention that it takes much longer to boil than any European electric kettle, however the price is much cheaper than most American kettles."
5,Still works after 5 years,"These kettles are perfect for boiling water quickly. I purchased my first one five years ago. It has been used almost every day, and it still works great. It's so useful that I bought a second one."
2,Looks like its been used and smells awful,"I just needed a small electric tea kettle and this seemed to be about the right one for a short term use.I'm leaving the country in a few months and it was only $11 so I said why not.When I got it, the lid part of the tea kettle was stained with some black stains as if it were used before.Another awful thing about this product is I haven't been able to use it because when I pour it on a powder soup or some tea, it makes my food smell AWFUL. Like a sewage kind of smell and I completely lose my appetite. I thought it was just the first time I use it, so I tried to use it again but no. I've washed it thoroughly and everything and I just can't seem to get rid of that awful smell. So it became useless without me using it once properly.I have two stars cuz it's cheap but it's not worth it. Just buy something that's $10-20 more. DON'T BUY THIS TEA KETTLE."
2,Poor connection,"I thought this would be a cost effective kettle for my office. It arrived very quickly, but I had to return it immediately.This is a one piece kettle & has the powercord that attaches into the base of the kettle. The cord would not stay connected in the kettle, it was so loose the only way I could get the kettle to boil was to hold the cord in place. I got a 2 piece cordless kettle instead, similar to the one I have at home and am very happy. This little kettle is not worth the price, getting a cordless with no parts to plug and unplug is worth the extra 7-10 dollars."
4,good size but you have to deal with the cord,"Pro: Good size, boils water fastCon: There is no separate base for the electric cord to be attached to. You have to carry the kettle around together with the cord to fill it with water. Or you can detach the cord, but it's a pain to do it all the time."
4,1 minor disappointment,"This product works very well. It was shipped and arrived with all of the parts and all of the necessary directions for use. the only thing I can say that I don't like is that the cord is on the short side, which to me as a college student is not a big issues because it's staying in it's on spot for a year.I recommend this to all college students!"
2,Buy The Bodum Ibis Instead,"I owned the Bodum, but we had to discard it after an unrelated kitchen accident. I bought this item because, well, it was $5 less and I figured that if they both boiled water, there was no reason to pay more. Two major problems: 1) The cord is very short, thus needing a short, straight line from the outlet into the machine. As is probably very normal, the outlets in my kitchen are shared by other appliances. The short length of the cord means that I have to move the toaster oven every time I want to use the kettle. 2) Unlike the Krups, with this larger heating element, you have to put a full two servings (as in coffee mugs) of water in the kettle for minimum use. Yeah, it's just water, but that's a waste, especially if you're using filtered or bottled water.Essentially, the Bodum was a timesaver... and now that I own this, I've gone back to using the microwave to heat up individual mugs of tea. It tried to save $5 and ended up wasting $15."
5,Handy....,I purchased this for my office. They recently got a deluxe coffee making machine and there was nothing to make hot water so I ordered this and it's perfect and boils the water very good.
1,It only lasted 3 months,"This planned obsolescence that manufactures are doing is getting worse, this kettle only last 3 months, I'm really bummed. Pretty soon we are not going to have enough land fills to keep up with all the junk that manufacturers are putting out there."
2,Don't buy it!,Just returned this..no problem with Amazon...but please don't waste your time with this inferior product. The cord is way too short and it spills boiling water all over. I have had an Oster electric kettle for years which is great..this one is poorly designed and cheaply made. Make sure you get a kettle with a base that has the cord in it so you can take the kettle to the cup or bowl.
4,It Does the Job,"This electric kettle heats water to boiling and turns itself off. The cord is not very long, but it was cheap. End of story."
2,Strong plastic smell,"You get what you pay for. I suspect I'll use it for a while (it really isn't worth spending the money to return it when it was only $11), but I wish I had bought a more expensive one that is metal inside because this one has a strong plastic smell that I don't like or want to think about drinking from.Also, the spot doesn't seem to close tighly enough on mine so i have to be very careful when pouring."
5,Great product!,Very easy to use. Boils water pretty fast. And compact design. Fairly priced. Great product. I personally like this product a lot!
2,Top leaks,"Not as good as the Bodum electric kettle I used to have. The design is attractive and it does heat water up quickly, but water often leaks from the edges of the lid as you pour it out which is both messy and dangerous. I am going to keep it - it doesn't seem worth the hassle of returning it - but I use this only at work and would NOT have it anywhere near children or older people due to the risk of burns."
5,Great little kettle,I really like this! So easy to use and a great size. I like that it is narrow and doesn't take up much room. Works great! Can't think of any cons.
1,Tea Kettle,"Proctor Silex tea kettle. My husband and I have over time bought 3 different types. The 1st was the 1 L and the cord busted after 9 months. We bought another and the cord busted after 6 months (making the unusable). Now we bought 1.7 L 3/22/12, and guess what, the power cord,again, went out so we can't use it. We have had this barely over a month! I will NEVER buy this product again! I urge you to look at other options!"
5,Great idea for dorm room,Purchased for a young lady heading off to college. A great feature of this kettle is that it separates from the power source for easy pouring. No manuvering an attached cord.
3,works great but loose plug.,i am constantly having to shake the plug that goes into the back of unit so that it makes full contact. does work great and very fast.
2,Not reliable,"It was great when I first bought it, but it began to fall apart after 3 months and stopped working in its 6th month. At first, the automatic shutoff stops working and then the light indicator went out. And one day, the whole thing just stopped working."
3,ok for the price,I purchased this kettle to replace one I'd had previously. I was surprised at the size; it was much smaller than I expected. It works fine - but the cord is very short so I had to rearrange the counter to allow it access to the wall socket.
4,For $15 can't be beat,"For a $15 expenditure cannot be beat. Made of plastic (not great but does the job-especially for $15), does not take long to warm up, relatively easy to clean, easy to see water level. The only critique is that it comes with an electric cord that is about 3 ft long. It would have been nice if it included a longer cord.PS- after using this thing more than a week noticed that the plastic taste that seems to rub off into the water does not seem to disappear, unlike some other plastic kettels. If you do not mind having your water taste like plastic would give this a three star rating, otherwise a 2."
1,Water smells like plastic,"I bought this electric kettle and while it did heat water very quickly, once I opened the lid the whole pot of water reeked of plastic. Needless to say, the water was not drinkable.I don't know if I was stuck with a bad unit but I would not recommend this electric kettle. Buyer beware."
4,Very convenient,This product works great and is easy to use. It is convenient to take with you where you need hot water fast. I don't use it anymore since I now have long term health concerns about heating up food and beverages in plastic containers.
2,Metal Corrodes,"I've had this kettle for about a year, and I wish I had spent money for a better product. When you put water in the kettle, it is exposed to the metal heating coil. The problem is that the coating on the metal corrodes very quickly, and bits of plastic flake into the kettle. This drastically impacts the taste of the water, to say the least. I agree with the other reviewers that said the kettle makes the water taste like plastic. Don't make the same mistake I made - spend a few more dollars to get a kettle that won't leave the water tasting like plastic."
3,Undecided,"The product works, but if you do not remember to empty the water out of it and turn it inside down to dry the coils start to rust. My husband forgets all the time. Wouldn't really say it was worth the price. Would have rather spent more money on a better product. It does heat up fast."
2,Broke after 45 days,"It worked fine, and then it just stopped working after about 45 days. It no longer turns on, so I'm returning it."
3,"good for heating, but...","I have used kettles before, so i feel qualified in rendering an opinion on this one. Two flaws:1. the screening part obstructs rather than facilitates water flow when you pours it; and2. you need to unplug it to put water in the body. With other base-types, you only need to take the kettle off from the base - - never the need to unplu and then, plug it."
1,strange odor,"Followed the directions for the initial cleaning (boil water in it twice then rinse) and afterward it still had a plastic odor inside but most all the odor seems to have dissipated after the third boil. Bought it to make black tea at work but am reluctant to actually do so until the plastic odor is completely gone.Design is easy to pour without getting burned by steam.3/5/12 Update: The kettle went into storage for a bit over two years. I've decided recently to take the kettle out of storage and try again. Water boiled in it seems to taste ok but the horrid, plastic odor is still there. I would have to be desperate for boiled water to use this kettle."
3,works but...,This product works fine. Heats water rapidly and is very easy to use. My only problem is the possiblity of toxins given off in the water that is heated in it. For this reason I limit the use of it with my daughters.
3,Flawed Top,"The water-boiling capability is good but the top (at least the one I have) does not close precisely, which means that the auto-off mechanism does not function every time. A couple of times I took my eyes off the kettle and it boiled off all the water and turned the metal at the bottom black (probably destroyed some kind of coating). I brought this based on the cheap price, it's definitely not as reliable as it could've been."
5,Proctor Silex Electric Kettle Review,"When the water and gas were turned off in the kitchen to allow renovation work to be done, the need for a source of boiling water became apparent. This kettle makes enough boiling water in just minutes for my hot chocolate, instant oatmeal and my husband's cup of tea each morning. It is efficient, easy to handle and an excellent product."
1,Switch Failure,"I purchased 2 of these to make 2-quarts of tea for iced tea. They worked great at first, but the on/off switch will break. After one of these broke, I bought another and that one has just failed, too. 3 units died, power switch the problem every time."
2,"Does the job, but built cheaply","I guess with this low price, I shouldn't complaint too much. But with the plastic material and poor built quality, you need to lower your expectation of its service time. Seeing so many positive review, I suspect the manufacture has lowered the quality standard for this product recently.Pros:Cheap price,Light weight,Boil a liter of water in reasonable timeCons:The whole thing is made of a thin layer of plastic&#65292;poorly finished. The lid has irregular surface, looks like been melted...It's inconvenient to plug and unplug every time you use it.The lid cannot be closed smoothly, and without the lid fully closed, the auto switch DOESN'T shut off after water boiling. This is DANGEROUS!The hinge of the lid is very thin plastic. With the effort to open the lid, it can be easily broken any day...The coil at the bottom of the jar is not easy to clean."
4,Totally Worth the $15,"Nice little product, especially the detachable cord so you can take it with you to your room or what not so you don't have to go back into the kitchen for a refill. Design wise, it is a nice to look at, compact and sleek. Boils at a decent speed. I've had another electric kettle that boiled much faster, but it didn't have a fail safe (this one does) and eventually ended up breaking. I like it! Very satisfied with my purchase :)"
1,Don't buy it! Worst taste ever!,"So, I bought this kettle thinking it was small and cheap, and it would be convinient for my small room. Turns out the kettle is cheap and small, but it give the water a horrible plastic taste, that after many many boilings doesn't go out. So DON'T BUY this kettle if you appreciate the taste of your tea, and also you health!"
2,Still some plastic taste after using several days and times,"I choose this electric kettle and it is fast when boiling water.But I feel very confused because the water has a strong plastic taste. I try for two days and several time, i even add some tea into the kettle and boiling again, the plastic taste still there.Is there any poisonous if i use this one?"
4,Nice product,I bought this cute little kettle last month and so far its worked pretty well. Only little trouble is that it takes a tad longer to heat water than my last one. On an average at max capacity it takes 10 min to heat. Otherwise its a good buy for lessOh good point! although white it does not get dirty at all.
2,OK... for the price,"This kettle heats water to boiling temperature and turns it off when it gets there.However, the cord is ridiculously short - maybe 12"".Secondly, there is no sound made when it finishes. It fortunately doesn't have the obnoxious whistle, but the little lever just pops up (no ding).Finally, it seems like it's very hard to pour this kettle without burning your hand, particularly when the cord is so short. The spout is very wide and pours slowly. If you turn it too much (because, say, it's pouring too slowly), then boiling water pours over your hand holding the cup."
3,Electric Kettle,"The price is good, but you can only use it for water. Do not try any other liquids or you will mess up the unit. You pay for what you get."
2,Hot Plastic?,"It does boil water in a flash, but that water tastes like plastic. And if it tastes like plastic, there must be at least some plastic by-products in every mug you drink. No thanks."
2,not so hot so fast,"I bought this kettle for use at my mother's house in the U.S., and I'm really disappointed with it. It seems to take forever to begin to heat the water. It actually seems slower than the cooktop. If I had it to do over again I would definitely invest in buying a higher quality model."
3,Not so useful for scientists,"I didn't realize when I ordered this book that it was so biased towards humantities. While they have some tips that are relevant to any educator, some of the topics which are crucial for the humanities (such as essays and hour-long class discussions) are less useful for an adjunct teaching intro chemistry!What I'd really like to see are tips for science educators -- how to run a lab, how to teach problem solving skills, how to involve students in active learning when you have so many FACTS to cover."
5,A fun read,"I enjoyed reading Tenure Track to Mommyville. The characters and their preoccupations really come alive. This book is well-written, often funny, and captures that whole who-am-I-and-where-am-I-going-from-here? dilemma that so many new at-home mothers experience.Barbara Grosh beautifully portrays the joys, frrustrations and ambivalence that are part and parcel of parenting."
2,"okay, but color fades fast","and I mean very fast. You could see the water lines in two days. We ordered the orange ones and by the end of the month, they were extremely discolored. Very disappointing."
4,Almost There!,"Having used dozens of brands, I have to say the Aterna product does more to straighten my waves than any other. However, it only does half the battle -- basically making for easier ironing and drying."
1,disappointing,"I found that his poduct wasn't worth the price. When I first applied it, the product like a 4.00 moisturizer. It's very over priced."
3,THE UNIQUE TOWN IN ALL OF AMERICA,"Lily Dale is one of a kind, no doubt about it. This is a town in New York State that caters to and is principally owned by Spiritualists. You will meet an array of characters that you will find only in this book and they are all devoted to be the benefit of others. Whether you believe in spirits or everlasting life is not really the issue. The fact is that many people do and this is a survey/rundown of how they think and their realities. The author was the greatest skeptic of all, yet after many visits in this town, her beliefs did change to a degree and you will find out why at the end of the story. You should enjoy all the information given and find out how ""the other half lives."""
3,Interesting story but hard to follow...,"Christine Wicker has written an objective book about the unusual community of Lily Dale. I am interested in all things supernatural, paranormal and spiritual but I really struggled to finish this book. While the material is fascinating it is poorly organized. Stories start in one chapter and pick up and finish in chapters much later in the book. There are too many people covered and keeping them straight is difficult. Overall, I'm glad I stayed with the book to the finish but I feel it could have been a much better book with a good editor and some organization."
5,Almost like attending the Opera.....,The Music Teacher is one of my favorite movies - music and songs are beautiful and alsogreat insight of learning the art of singing properly -Story is presented in a lovely way and the photography is there in equal parts to match thisfilm. Very happy to have this DVD for myself and share with friends.
2,Great entertainment..........for about 15 min.,"A fun little game to kill time at the office, but not addictive. Play the game 4 or 5 times and you will see, this is it. No more levels, no more guns, no more targets, no more fun. One level only and it gets old quick. For the price you can find much much better games. Oh well maybe next time?"
1,wrong region,This product is unusuable -- it is programmed for Region 2 use and we are in Region 1. I had no idea there is a difference -- but this copy will not play on my computer without making changes to my computer. If I change my computer to Region 2 -- then none of my other DVDs will play. My computer says I can only change the region 4 times and then we are stuck on that region for the life of my computer. I have easily ordered many DVDs from Amazon without problems -- but -- this is a BIG hassle. I am now uneasy about ordering from Amazon.
3,Obsession in a funny way.,"Addicted to Love starring Meg Ryan and Matthew Broderick is a predictable romantic comedy. The acting is good but these poor pathetic characters are so obsessed with their ex's, it kinda freaks me out how far they will go to get them back. Kelly Preston is the object of affection to Broderick's character, he then starts a quriky friendship with Ryan's character and they eventually end falling for each other. Addicted to Love is fun at times but not the best I have seen in this genre, pretty much a mixed bag."
1,This movie is brain dead.,"I don't know if I've ever in my life enjoyed a movie less than this one. It's slow-witted and vulgar at the same time - not a single character is likeable, and not a single scene is believeable. By the end of it, I didn't care if they got together or not.The only reason I really care about this movie being so bad is that it's such a waste of two talented people. Meg Ryan is a terrific actress who has done countless better movies. Matthew Broderick is a capable actor and can certainly do much better than this nonsense.Don't waste your time with this movie, folks."
4,"Four stars for the movie, not the DVD","First of all, Meg Ryan is the ebodiment of every acknowledged id out there. Who wouldn't want the chance to get even with the man who scorned you? Matthew Broderick, obsessed with his lost love, happens to cross Meg's path in the process, and the two become unlikely allies.Dark, funny and sweet all at the same time, Addicted to Love is a romantic, if strangely endearing film. Unfortunately, can't say the same for the DVD. Zero special features. Sure, you get scene selection and interactive menus, but what doesn't have that?I bought mine used, but the point is I bought it. Don't overpay, but buy it cheap, and you'll be glad you got it."
3,Good Cast-Mediocre Movie,"Addicted to Love was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Matthew Broderick and Meg Ryan among others.The movie brings to the screen the story of a young man who travels to New York City in an effort to change his girlfriend's mind after her terminating their relationship. Once there, he discovers that she is already living with someone and consequently sets up an elaborate surveillance system. Things get even more complicated when he finds out that he is not the only heartbroken ""ex"" who will go to great lengths to get his former lover back...In short, the acting is surprisingly average (!), the setting is pretty good, while the dialogues and the plot are below average.Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off. A shame really..."
4,"smart scenario, great cast...","I watched that movie on tv and i think it is great! The cast is great, they play perfect. Scenario is great, it is simple and smartly written.This movie is about an escape from a nazi camp of american soldiers. But nothing is exaggerated here. Everything is logical and smartly played. You dont want to miss any scene.It is black and white as it is 50 years old but still stunning. do not miss that movie!"
5,A Classic,"If you like a little comedy mixed in with a war movie then here you go. This takes place in a German POW camp, Stalag 17. ofcourse the major things to do are to survive and escape. Watchi how these men band together and make that happen."
5,very pleased with purchase,The item arrived timely in perfect condition and at a reasonable price. Would order on line again as it is so convenient and better than running around trying to find an unusual item
5,Am glad to have this classic,We have always loved this classic war movie. We're glad to finally have a copy of our own that we can watch whenever we want to.
2,This is an example of an unbelievable book!,"This story was unbelievable in many ways, not just because the idea of transplanting a human brain into a chimpanzee's body is incredible, but also because of the lack of emotion in the main character. We had a very hard time understanding why there was no anger involved in this incident. How could Eva not have been even a little bit angry at her parents for doing this to her? Many of the students in our book discussion group could not connect with the relationship between Eva and her mother. Most thought the book was extremely unemotional, a surprise considering the topic. Some students, however, felt that it was an example of the coldness of our society."
4,Wow! Very thought provoking.,"What do a chimpanzee and a thirteen-year-old girl have in common? More than you think. When Eva is in a car accident and thrown into a deadly coma, her life becomes intertwined with a female chimp's named kelly. Eva can tell something is not right when she wakes up and and can't move. Her bosy is numb all over and she can't speak. She is struck with horror as she sees herself in the mirror for the first time! Will she ever be the same again? The answer comes faintly from her poor mother's lips, ""no."""
2,boring!!!!,"This book was on a mandatory reading list in my school so I had to read it. I still can't believe that teachers would want kids to read this. This book is poorly written and boring. The plot wasn't great and neither were the characters. Considering that I am an avid reader who enjoys reading almost anything, its sad that I could barely get through this. It must be hell fro someone who doesn't like to read. Please, don't waste your money or your time on this!"
3,"Okay book. Nice and creative idea, but missing that lure.","Eva is a good book. I enjoyed it, but I found some parts stupid. An example of this is how EVA's diary jumps around from a few days after to twenty-four years!! I personally would have liked to hear more about her relationships with the monkeys more and would have liked to know more about her children's early life."
1,not good,"this book was hard to understand and difficult to read. there were not enough details, and it was hard to visualize."
3,Not as basic as it's made out to be.,"I already had some reliability related books and was intrigued by the claim of this one being more practical info. I didn't really feel this was the case after glancing through the book. I already own Accelerated Testing: A Practitioner's Guide to Accelerated And Reliability Testing by Dodson & Schwab. I found ""Accelerated Testing..."" more readable and applicable to learning about reliability and various models used in performing accelerated testing. Had the publisher allowed viewing inside the book online, i probably would have figured out it wasn't what it's cracked up to be. Amazon, as always, graciously let me return it."
2,Straws,Good product. I use these in my business and thought according to the description that I would get the normal amount of straws for that price. I did not. I paid about double what I normally pay when I ordered directly through Lollicup. Very disappointed.
3,good straws,i like these better than the others i have bought previously. they are a bit thicker and it makes them sturdier inside the cake.
1,Historical Revisionism At Its Worst!,One wonders if Kissinger had final cut on this romantic portrayal of the man. See The Trial of Henry Kissinger for the truth. This video should come with a disclaimer that it is a fictional account of how Kissinger would like to be perceived by history.
3,It's okay.,"Ordered this thinking it was a set, because the picture of each size shows a set, yet it was not. Can't return it because the papers that came in the box were shredded and messy, return label was already removed from the sheet, not that I could be bothered to return it. The box it came in was smashed in. The dumbbell itself is good, and will serve its purpose. Will have to order another dumbbell because it was not a set, but will NOT order it from Amazon.com"
2,"Not Bad, But Not Good","This book really disssapointed me. The blurb sounded so exciting. How can you accidently rob a bank? But it was very bland. There wasn't anything overtly wrong with it, such as lame dialogue or flat characters, and the plot was fairly imaginative. But for all that, it couldn't hold my attention."
1,Pages started falling our during the first read...,and continued to fall out more and more with each read proceeding. The script was virtually worthless after the first 12 hours.
2,Doesn't ring true,"Living in Kentucky, I was looking forward to reading this. However, it took only a few pages to see that the dialogue didn't ring true. The thoughts and conversations seem more like what a 20th century playwright would think, rather than an early American settler."
4,waist pack review,"I collect,sort & sell golf balls for charity and this morning attended a sale and we used the waist packs for the first time. There was ample space for marking pens, check book, a mobile 'phone & other personal things PLUS a nice spot to stash the dollar bills in - it suited my needs better than anything else I looked at.I am very happy with my purchases and the waist pack seems sturdy enough to see me through many, many sales."
2,"A poor, propagandistic book on the development of vodka.","This is a book that purports to tell the history of vodka. It was originally undertaken to prove that 'vodka' was invented first in Russia in an attempt to fight off attempts by Poles to usurp the name 'vodka' in international trade.Though there is undoubtedly much research that went into this work, the author does his readers a great disservice by his arrogance and cultural prejudices. Though his facts seem solid, his interpretation tends to be circular and often one conclusion is built on a whole chain of very shaky intermediate claims. His main conclusion, that vodka was invented not only soley by Russians, but in Moscow as well, is reached, by among other devices, carefully defining the product first.Nonetheless, the work is of some interest, but it really does need to be taken with more than a grain of salt. It will have to do until a more comprehensive and fair work is produced in the English language."
2,not permanent results but slow growth..,"it slows the growth down for1 becasue you epilate the hair from th root, so it takes just a ""little"" time to grow back and this spray adds a ""little"" more time to grow back, i have been using this for over a year now and i see nothing permanent for sure!!!!!"
3,just ok,"Been using the product for about 2 weeks and I have noticed a slight slowing of hair growth on my chin area. But, the hair still grows. I am glad that it does not grow as fast or has much though."
4,Great interactive book...but easily destroyed by 2 yr. old!,"My daughter loved this book! The movable parts even made her demand her potty so that she could try the same movements as the book's character! In the first hour, though, she tore one of the tabs. Still, a fun and engaging book!"
3,Served in Washington with Ambassador Sosa,"I spent two years working as a driver with Ambassador Sosa and this book is so refreshing. He worked tirelessly to eradicate Noriega and obtain freedom.May God continue to bless you!Stephen E Sealy, Author[...]"
5,Flesh and Bone,"I thought that everyone's acting was great. James Caan played a man who used his son to act like a lost boy to gain access to houses so his father could rob them. His son was still a young boy but was tired of his father's thefts, when he noticed that one family he went to as a lost boy had kept guns. I won't say anything more except that he let his father in when the family was still awake and he was supposed to wait until they were asleep. James Caan as the father was very evil. Dennis Quaid as the son was very kind. This movie shows that biology does not necessarily determine behavior. You have free will. I felt the ending was sad."
4,queiter queen,"mellower effort, then anything previous but that's when you see why Freddie mercury was one of the best, plus of course brian may continues to be a one man guitar orchestra once again,just a super talented band, making a very good album, not my favorite queen album, but definetly shows of Freddie's great voice, particularily on Take my breath away, teo torialto, and of course somebody to love, not so many rockers on this one, and to be honest tie your mother down is one of my least faves by the band, but i do like May's,white man."
2,"Queen in their Prime Years, but not on this CD","I am the biggest Queen fan that there is. I love every Queen CD that there is out. This is Queen in 1976. Right after the masterpiece ""A Night At the Opera"", and right before another genius album ""News Of the World"", Every Queen fan will probably tell you that this is their favorite or close to it. As an album compared to other music of other artists it is great. But, compare it to other Queen music and it doesn't stand up. It sounds like a lot of effort went into the production of this album, but maybe not as much to the songwriting. There are great songs like ""You & I"", ""You Take My Breath Away"" and ""Good Old Fashioned Loverboy"" . The rest are mediocre at best."
4,A Ring for Everything,"The rings arrived in a cheap packaging, the box that it was in was stapled on the sides to keep it together. However, all 50 rings were present in the box. Although some of the rings weren't all identical, some of them barely lined up. Overall, the rings work fine and it keeps my notecards together."
3,A good start but...,"Warning: Read book very slowlyThe idea is a sound one but requires that the reader provides a working system AND is able to backtest it. Otherwise, the reader is left with a concept that on paper makes sense but it is very hard to implement into his/her trading system."
3,A good start but...,"Warning: Read book very slowlyThe concept requires total concentration-while reading in order to throughly understand MAE.

3,Consider color-,I originally ordered this in walnut for my son. It was back ordered for so long I opted for the black.I think he would have preferred waiting for the walnut.
1,Dont waste your time or money!!,"This is the most frustrating thing I have ever tried to do! I used brand new razor blade in my utility knife, and instead of cutting the film, it just rips! Save yourself some time and stay away!!"
5,Yummy!,S&B; karashi is a traditional Japanese favorite.I love this stuff!I put it on egg rolls when I want hot mustard.It also goes well with a variety of Japanese dishes.Only regret is that I couldn't get a larger size.
4,Excellent CD!,"Che Arthur's latest album, All Of Your Tomorrows Were Decided Today is very outstanding! His latest album lyrics are just so touching you couldnt even imagine.. You gotta buy this rock CD so you wont miss out! :)"
2,A Real Good Sleeper for Me,"I was intrigued by the title of this film because it combined the Wild West with Sci Fi. How could it go wrong? Westerns are fun. Sci Fi is fun.Unfortunately, I don't remember much about this film except that Daniel Craig had something stuck to his arm, Harrison Ford was angry about something, the aliens looked like rabid dogs or something, and there were space ships that looked like dragon flies on steroids.The problem was that I fell asleep about 30 minutes into the movie and woke up 30 minutes before the end.I tried watching it again the next day, and the same thing happened.So, I guess I could call this a good sleeper."
1,Awful!,"There are not many movies that I actually have to stop watching, but Cowboys & Aliens was one of them. Why? Because it was total trash. I stopped watching the film at about the half hour mark. I found that I didn't care about the characters, found most of the acting dreadful, dare I say Harrison Ford was at the top of this list, and I wasn't interested in the supposed storyline. In this half hour we had one guy trying to take a dump into the river and another peeing into a bowl in his cell!? Why was this? The director or writers have a bathroom fetish or something? The portrayal of the West was painfully bad. The whole story up to the half hour mark was just stupid! How does garbage like this make it past the idea stage. So, yeah, really dumb movie.If someone wants to see a good movie about aliens visiting earth that's well done and a lot of fun I recommendGalaxy Quest, Sam Rockwell is in that movie too and does a much better job."
1,Cowboys and Aliens,The movie was probably good as I saw the first half or so and then the Amazon streaming process did not work very well and we finally gave up trying to watch. This is the first movie we watched from Amazon and probably the last. Back to other sources for my video streaming.
2,Surprisingly boring,"The commercials for this movie looked really interesting, but the movie was surprisingly boring. As you're watching it, you can come up with 100 better aliens vs. cowboy movies. After seeing the commercial for ""Men in Black III,"" I think anyone wanting to watch this should just hold on until that comes out."
2,kinda dumb but somewhat entertaining,not much to say other than what i said in the title. If you've seen everything else why not see this too?
2,Cowboys and Aliens,"Save your money. The film is a waste of time on just about every level. After all the hype and built-up expectations, I was sadly disappointed."
2,I wish I cared about anyone character in this movie.,"Good cg great cast. Script made of garbage.Harrison Ford is basically playing what i would call old Han Solo, but its mostly in a good way, though the script never seems to figure out how to make him the anti hero/scoundrel he's supposed to be.Everytime something bad happend to a character, I kept wondering why I don't care.Probably has something to do with the lack of character development.There was moment after moment of missed opprotunities with cg and action, plot development, cohesion and so on.Machete had better character development.mk?"
3,Cowboys and Aliens,Was good entertainment movie. Kept my wife interested. Good sspecial effects. I would take my children to see it. Lot of action it would keep them watching.
3,Wonder how it ends,"Never got to the end. Kindle Fire froze up-never to return.Was entertaining to that point, though....Maybe I should rent it from Netflics...."
4,Cowboys & Aliens,The movie was filled with action which held a few surprising twists. It was very entertaining even though the battle over gold and planetary seemed a little far-fetched.
3,This isn't much of a review since I'm not much of a critic.,Olivia Wilde sure looks like Kris Williams. Is that why you never see them both in the same room together?
1,"Yes, it sucks.","When the guy jumped from his horse onto the wing of an airborn CGI spaceship, a little part of me died inside. When the subplot about 'stop being racist toward Indians' cropped up, another cluster of braincells shut off in my mind. This movie was easy to write off even as it was unfolding on the screen.Oh yeah, and the whole plot device centering around a bracelet? Lame. What would you say to a film whose plot centered around an unexplained magical weapon?"
1,Very bad DVD,"My Wife got so angry she broke that dvd especialy around the end of the movie,because so many freezes and so many times I have to wash that dvd. Nothing did help! You guys are not watching your staff? A movie as good it needs to be taking care better than that."
3,Fun film,"We had a great time watching this rather goofy film. Was a tad intense and scary for some of the wee ones, but we knew it was filled with adventure when we started it.Space Aliens and Cowboys .... how could you go wrong with this one."
1,The worst movie of 2011,Big budget disappointment. Sorry mess of a screenplay. All that big build-up comes to nothing in a 2nd half that is at once incoherent and lacking in ideas. Buy at your own risk.
1,do not waste your time,"Usually my husband picks the movies and he does a good job, but even if this movie has some good actors playing in it....it sucked. I was tempted to stop watching after 20 minute, but I kept watching just to see how bad it was, and it was pretty bad. Do not waste your time, it is so boring...Too many good things to do, than waste your time watching this movie."
5,love it!,love the movie - love daniel craig! lots of action and not a lot of gore. as always - super fast shipment.
4,Better than expected,This was an interesting concept for a movie and we really enjoyed it. I think Craig and Harrison played well together on screen and the characters were developed pretty well.
3,Half and Half,"The Western part of the story is very good, and the actors assembled are great.The ""Alien"" part of the story, however, is quite bad. A glaring error was never even bothering to explainwhat was motivating the aliens in the first place. (They allude to this, but never bother to explain it)A mistake the movie SUPER 8, for example, did not make.Anyway, not totally disappointing, but not satisfying either.Thus, if you don't expect much, you'll enjoy it."
1,Not very good,"Poor film with such a great actor. Will be traded in ASAP. Should have listen to my wife and not made this purchase, she said the clue was in the title."
3,Not a Classic Yet....,"I have no problem mixing the Western & Alien genres, and I have no problem with the cast or acting in the film...but something is lacking. There are some slow spots and the action doesn't really pick up until towards the end, but there is some suspense albeit not much. I think Craig and Ford are fantastic in the roles they are assigned, but the film overall reminds me of how audiences viewed Predator when it first appeared in the 80's. The audience was kind of torn between ""is is it sci-fi or is it action-adventure?"" Of course in time we all grew to love the Predator franchise as a hybrid film. I think Cowboys and Aliens will be more appealing 10 years from now than it does present day, which in a way is a praise. It reminds me of a B movie on steroids and good B movies stand the test of time. If this becomes a cult classic we will have to wait and see, but I think it is setting a stage for future films to mix genres in a modern, appealing way."
2,Nothing works here...,"How on earth did this ""movie"" get made? There goes 2 hours of my life I cannot get back. Nothing about this movie makes any sense. But I guess todays' movie audiences are looking for action, not substance!"
3,cowboys and aliens,"The movie had a lot of action. No nasty. so that was goood. but there was zero plot. where did the space girl come from? and why did the aliens want the gold? Not much for having a point. So it was mind numbing entertainment. You didn't have to think. Again, NO PLOT."
3,Cowboys and 'Deamons',Certainly not what I expected after all the hype. Actors did a great job with their performances. Was certainly a twist for a SciFi. Entertaining all the same.
4,"Good movie, not great","Just about every Friday night, my husband and I have a movie night. Actually, it would probably be more accurate to say that we have a movie night at least three times a week. Tonight's movie choice was Cowboys and Aliens. I remember seeing previews and thought that it looked like a cool film with some pretty good special effects. I really enjoyed the action, characters and plot. It was definitely worth seeing. As far as adding it to my collection, I'm not so sure it's a necessity."
2,Nothing new,"First I want to start out saying that the only saving grace for this film were Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig. Having said that, the movie is really not worth the price of a movie house admission. SCI FI at its worst. The first part of the movie, about an hour or so, it is very slow even though greatly acted out by Ford and Craig. Nothing is new or refreshing about this movie. Let's see, the cattle baron rules over an entire western town.......Old stuff from old westerns. The Aliens themselves, seem to be taken out of the movie ALIEN. So, not much creativity there. I said it in one of my previous posts, whatever happened to good movie writers lately in Hollywood? The plot and the dialogue were really silly at times. And I also have seen better CG in other SCI FI movies. Great, if you want to watch it on Netflix or cable, but not worth it the admission fee at the movies."
3,Nice scenery.,"It was fun to watch and all, but i kinda wish it had been filmed in black and white. and 3d! (if that's possible.)"
4,Really Good,Gotta Say this Movie Seems Really Weird--That it was but it was very Good-Much better than I Expected!! I Will Probably Buy This Movie!!
5,Cowboys and Aliens,We thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Very entertaining and great concept - great story - well written and produced. A must see. It was so good - I'd watch it again.
4,Cowboys and Aliens and it works?? Who would have thought!,"When I first saw the trailer for this film I was very skeptical.I enjoy Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig, and who doesn't like a good western... but ALIENS??It just seemed like too much or a bad mix of 2 over played genre's...Yet when I watched this film for the first time there were multiple emotions that came over me.First I felt like I was watching a great western like Tombstone. The story, the characters, scenes etc... all made me feel like i was in the old west taking part of the film.Then when the alien's were slowly brought into the mix I felt like I was seeing an epic such as Star Trek for the first time!The 2 so easily meshed together in a way that only a great director and producer could engineer...this is a MUST see for any history or Sci-Fi fanatic!"
1,Trash,"This show is way too overrated!Ok,so you have a whiny girl who eats everything she sees and never gains weight.And then you have bishounen who all fall for the her!And plus,the rape scenes in here are way out of place!It could have been good,but I just couldn't bring myself to like it.Miaka and Tamahome fall in love way too fast and screaming each other's name every five minutes get so annoying!But,I'm not saying someone else might not like it.I just hated it.Maybe if the characters were more mature,I might have enjoyed it."
5,GREAT SERIES!,"I am a great fan of anime and this is a very good example of it. The animation is wonderful and the colors are vibrant and rich. A lot of work went into making this. And now that the first 26 episodes have been released on DVD, I can enjoy them whenevr I want. I can hardly wait for the other set!"
5,"Hey, I like it!","I had bought this set a few months ago and meant to write a positive feedback about Fushigi Yuugi.If you like that innocent and romantic kind of anime, I'd totally recommend it to anyone who is irked by the nudity and hard-core violence most anime feature. Though I hate Sailormoon, it looks something like that except the only main star is Miaka, a 15 year old senior in junior high. She goes through the quest of summoning Suzaku to grant her wishes for ancient China..It's better to watch it than having to read what others think of it. Right now, I'm waiting for Amazon to find the remaining episodes of Fushigi Yuugi. I'm that eager to see the rest of it!"
3,"Difficult poem, beautiful illustrations","The poem follows a group of 7 who infiltrate a kingdom and kill soldiers (and the king?). Then they must try to get out. I found that part of storyline distasteful even though it is linked to the first part of the poem in which there are some beautiful images. The images that touched me were of infants remembering past lives, being born in a family of memories, and a husband braiding his hair with his wive's hair.David Bolduc's illustrations are wonderful. I am so glad that I saw them.The poem is presented in type and in red pen which I found distracting.The 3 stars are for the enchanting illustrations and the poem's beginning. I realize it is my personal taste that I did not care for the killing aspect--which was not given the framework of purpose, morality."
3,"Nice images, but most 'old' and a lot of interviews","I'll be short here: it's nice the first time, but probably quickly dissapointing for 3 reasons:1) the images are all of the typical 'have seen that a million times already' category2) there is too much interviewing/talking, compared to showing cool images.3) it's a bit shortThere are much better Desertstorm documentaries out there. But unfortunately, they are scarce and most use the images that have been shown over and over...."
4,gift purchase,"A friend requested these as a Christmas gift and a group of us got together and bought virtually all that he has written, even his older books are still relevant today. Shipped Fast, great condition, exactly as promised. give this seller an A+"
3,Steve's first solo album,"This was Steve's first after leaving Traffic, released in June 1977, and no one knew what to expect. However, when it was first released the thing that everybody noticed was that Jim Capaldi co wrote and played on the album along with Reebop and co produced by Chris Blackwell(all of Traffic fame). So it was more than a little surprising to find nothing sounding like Traffic. Hold On goes nowhere and Time Is Running Out is way to disco. However, what Steve Winwood album doesn't have something good to offer? On this one it's Midland Maniac and Let Me Make Something In Your Life but the rest doesn't really go anywhere."
5,Very helpful book,"Although the word ""Anger"" is in the title, this book helps you to identify all of your emotions and sort out your feelings."
3,Mechanical Winwood,"After the smash success of 1980's ""Arc of a Diver,"" this album is something of a dissappointment. Only ""Valerie"" and ""Help Me Angel"" are up to the standards of the previous album. Winwood's smooth pop delivery starts to sound forced and mechanical after awhile. Perhaps this is why it took him four years to release his next album, the far superior ""Back in the High Life."" ""Talking Back to the Night"" is a weak link between two success stories."
5,"You get what you pay for, top quality.","Easy assembly, quality build, well ballanced and easy to use. This unit is expensive but then again the cheaper brands in comparison are way overpriced. I like the fact that they use tube type tires that are filled with expandable foam. This unit does not leak one drop. There is a slight bit of play between the handle bars and where they are connected to the frame but unless it fails I just don't care. The frame is powder coated just like the frames on my KTM motorcycles and that's quality. I also have a wall mounted Rapid Reel mounted on the south side of my home for two years and it still looks like new. The plastic three point mounted handle looks a little weathered but works like new. I will update if there are any problems."
3,3 1/2 stars actually,"I was surprised I had never heard of this book before and I was excited to read it. It was interesting. It started out great, dragged in the middle, and then picked up thankfully toward the end."
1,KIDS ARE NOT STUPID!,"I bought this for my daughter, who is becoming the photo buff that I am. She's actually quite good at age five, always wanting to snap shots with my camera. She knows, however, the when pictures are downloaded onto the computer, they are not supposed to be so grainy that you can't tell what you are viewing in the photo. She also has become very good at centering the photo in the viewfinder, but that's not what turns out to be on the picture. This camera is nice in the fact that the child only has to push one button, aim, and shoot- but the BEST resolution, which is AWFUL only allows about 20 pictures to be stored on the camera before a download. I don't know many children who take a trip to the zoo or the beach and take only 20 shots. I would rather spend the extra money and get my child the one that will entertain her, teach her a new hobby, and serve the purpose of getting her to STOP WANTING MY CAMERA!!!"
2,Save your money!,"You may be tempted to buy this one because it is a little cheaper than the others. RESIST! I bought three books to prep for National Registry and this one was far and away the worst. There are multiple wrong answers with incorrect explanations. The protocols are all outdated and the new ones aren't included (mainly because this is an older book). Also the paper it is printed on is porous (highlighters will bleed), dark, cheap paper. Toss in a couple more dollars and get the Learning Express or EMT-P Self-Assessment books. You'll be glad you did."
2,"Film is great, but it's overpriced for a DVD-R","I guess this is what we all have to look forward to. All films from the past are going to be DVD-R's, I suppose it is the only way that the very poor Warner Bros. can afford to release these old films. I just wish that they wouldn't charge so much for a dvd-r"
2,not so cheery,"The main review called this ""the cheeriest album about millennial tension and apocalyptic craziness that you're likely to hear."" Huh? I wouldn't call anything on here remotely ""cheery."" Even if you are a fan of ambient trip-hop, or whatever cleverly-named genre this is supposed to fit into, you would be hard pressed to call this an ""up"" album. Even atmospheric or relaxing would be a stretch. I truly enjoyed the Orb's ""Adventures Beyond the Ultra World"" album many years ago. As I recall, that one had actual songs and some interesting dance rhythms. This one just has ... odd sounds. Tunes that float and burp and go nowhere. The appeal of this one totally escapes me. Good to put on late night and fall fast asleep to."
5,the sound of our world,"is this music? who cares? the orb is the true heir of kraftwerk, but whereas kraftwerk just never went over the edge to true pandemonium; the orb embraces it, and molds it into the soundtrack of our lives. immerse yourself in the orb, let the orb wash over you, then you can be as wierd as these guys..."
2,An experienced musician on autopilot,"This album is not terrible, it is quite adequate and even sophisticated in a background music sort of way..It is just not very engaging on the forefront though..We all know Alex is a masterful programmer, but the famework that surrounds his beats this time generally does not hold the listeners attention, the album is mostly a showcase for the spastic and weird, rather then evolving beats that engulf a listener into the most immersive experience techno has to offer..You could definitly track this artist's waxing and waning of artistic zeal, with this album continuing Patterson's return to his more dancy, breezy roots, while incorporating the more twisted, dark elements of his post ultraworld releases.."
4,Pure enjoyment!,"I'm a big fan of Charlotte Church, so the first couple of times I listened to this CD all I could do was compare her voice to Charlotte Church. This took some of the enjoyment out of it but once I got past that and could really listen to the CD I loved it. Haley has such a beautiful voice! My favorite is River of Dreams. I did groan at the fact that they put Amazing Grace on the CD because I think the song has been so overdone, even though she does sing it beautifully. I personally would steer clear of any songs Charlotte Church has sung (this CD has 2 Charlotte Church songs) because it magnifies the desire to compare the two, rather than helping you to see them as uniquely talented singers. I also agreed with another reviewer who felt that she was drowned out by some of the arrangements. But overall, this is a great CD and I'll be on the lookout for her next one."
4,Quite adequate,I use it in the bedrrom and the remote is useful at bedtime. Everything has been to my satisfaction except the I Pod connectionn which is a bit to clumsy and dsitracts from an overall mgood design.
4,"Tedious at times, but worth the read","Several times in the middle, I got so tired of reading repetitive speeches by the unctuous know-it-all Chuan, that I almost quit. Glad I didn't, as the action finally picked up at the end with startling surprises that made me glad I finished it. I probably wouldn't plow through it again, but there are parts, especially in the last hundred pages that I won't forget."
1,A classic tale for armchair warriors,"This book is terribly written. And what is worse are the five star reviews for it. I've noticed a common thread in those reviews - spelling errors, grammatical errors, and simple-minded analysis (although the last is understandable - there isn't anything deep in the source material). This book does NOT get into the mind of a warrior, does NOT shed any new light on the war, is NOT a field manual for snipers, and to top it off, is so poorly written it's laughable. I'm not doubting Hathcock's bravery - I am merely commenting on the book itself. There are much better books on the subject out there. This book is good for some people though - wannabes, hillbillies, junior high dropouts, surplus store employees...."
1,hype,"This book only contains made-up nonsense. Hathcock was a superb shot and should have left it at that. There is not one shred of valid evidence to back any of these ""kills."" The Sea Tiger rag is not a valid source but that's where the sea story begain."
3,A Professional,"Without being too interested in the Vietnam War, I stumbled across this book during a trip in the US. Hathcock is definitely a master at what he does. And the book reveals that much about a man who has a job to do, and who does it with the thoroughness, concentration and craft probably equal to Stradivarius' when he was building violins.Of course, one can object that Hathcock was just coldly killing men. But is any soldier in time of conflict supposed to do so ? The only difference is that a sniper brings a more subtle death, silent and distant. Hathcock is a survivor, living by his own rules and principles,beyond the military regs he's got to obey. A man I wish I couldve met and have a beer with."
1,Why was this book written?,"Regardless of your politics, stop and think for a minute. This man was, assuming what he writes is true, personally responsible for killing 93 people, none of whom had any chance to fight back, prepare themselves or do anything at all. This is a step or two above cold-blooded murder, but not far. If you had spent several years doing something like this, why would you write a book about it? Why would you glory in it? A best-case analysis is that he felt this was something that had to be done, distasteful as it was. Then do it and out of respect for the people whose lives you had to end, shut up about it. But presenting this horrible career in slaughter as some kind of role model or heroism is obscene. What kind of mind would view it that way? This whole idea is sickening."
5,Marine sniper,This book is an amazing book. I really liked it. It never was boring it always had something happening. It was about a sniper how went to Vietnam and sniped over 93 Vietnamese died from him. His name is Carlos hancoth. He was a really good sniper and later became a legend. Shooting was his sport. He would go behind enemy lines and kill commanders and other high ranked officers from the Vietnamese. I would rate this book a 5 because I couldn't put the book down it was too interesting.
5,Great Book,"Hathcock was a hero, as were most of the men and women who gave so much in Lyndon Johnson's fool's errand we remember as the Vietnam war. His reward? A pension of less than $700 a month and incredible physical and mental pain. Our politicos send men and women to war, given them medals, and we all bask in their heroic sacrifices, while they are relegated to the dusty alleys of lives that could have been."
5,"it's not the body count, it's the man","Carlos Hathcock did not discover sniping. He did, however, revive it.This book draws the reader right in and pulls him along like a sniper drag bag. A must read for anyone wanting to know about the discipline needed to be a sniper."
2,"Okay for children, I guess.","As the previous reader indicates, this book is more for children, as long as they understand it's a fictionalized account. Adults beware, it is far from stelular. The competition shooting part is correct, but from there on it doesn't even reach orbit."
5,Marine Sniper,"We just received this book on Tues 10/12, and already my husband states that he's half way through the book. States - It's awesome reading for anyone interested in shooting accuracy and marksmanship."
5,My favorite sniper book,I have read many books on snipers and this one is probably my favorite. Carlos Hathcock was truly a legendary sniper. He saved many American lives because of his skill with a bolt action sniper rifle. This book is one that you will not want to put down. I strongly recommend this book if you have an interest in military snipers or military history.
4,awesome,well i love it but few movies was not there they put differnt movie in it the master with jet li isnt that movie its the tv series the master
4,"Good theme, but All in Black and White","I bought both C. Zinn's books ""Javelin Photo Archive..."" and ""AMX Photo Archive..."", as well as Patrick Fosters's ""AMC Performance Cars Photo Archive"". Although its good to see more books on AMC cars, I was dissapointed, and not expecting these books to all be in Black & White only. Not a trace of color! Although I do feal that the two books by C. Zinn, have more of a purpose in the ""concept to Reality"" theme, rather than just being picture books. Given the price of these paperback books, and because it was not obvious from the Amazon description, I thought it was a good idea to at least let others know. If you like color, this book is not gong to have any. Try Larry Mitchell's ""AMC Muscle Cars"", or, ""AMX &Javelin; Gold Portfolio"".Bottom line: I appreciate the effort put in the concept to reality theme, but a little disappointing for me. It would have been a great book if it was in color for a little more money."
5,Ch'i: The Power Within,Ch'i the Power WithinExcellent book on breathing techniques and exercise. Large A4 format for easy reading. Highly recommended.
4,you have to take the good with the bad,"like all tricky, you have to take the good with the bad. there are some tracks that are inaccessible, but at the same time (in the same cd) there are some absolute must haves. basically, not the best tricky album to cut your teeth on, but if you know what you are getting into, then buy it."
3,the first 3 tracks are great...,or maybe the first 4 tracks but the others are disappointing i guess
4,Underated if unpolished gem,"I think this is one of Tricky's better albums but is usually snubbed when i mention it to people.This is probably his darkest and most intense work, making it all the more endearing for being so.His signature incoherant, lispy grumblings are present - and stand out on the tracks Tricky Kid and Sex Drive.The earlier tracks are a lot funkier than the last few which could have been trimmed off without loss.Still i am happy to have it in my collection and do still play it on occassions though not at my Grandma's birthday party."
4,Post-Millennium re-appraisal,"I always remember hearing Tricky's first single, Aftermath, for the first time, playing in a record shop in Bath. It was quite unlike anything else I had ever heard.Hearing it on the radio recently when the singer Martina Topley Bird was talking about her musical past, it still sounded more futuristic and imaginative than anything around today. The next few singles and the brilliant Maxinquaye album put Tricky at the forefront of the burgeoning trip-hop movement that stemmed from Bristol at the time.Although I snapped up all the singles from this, the second album (Christiansands, Tricky Kid, the truly exceptional Makes Me Wanna Die) I somehow never acquired the album itself until now. Nine years on, it remains loaded with atmosphere and ambience, thanks in no small part to the exquisite and exceptional vocals of Martina, who was nominated for a Mercury award for her first solo album in 2003 (also recommended)"
2,Did not really care for it,"I didn't really care for this book. Yes, its giving you the History of what we think is paradise but it didn't have me wanting to know more. If you're interested in the violence, the daily life of the Jamaicans and the radical groups and government this may be for you."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this as a Christmas gift in 2008 for my friend to match her red-themed kitchen. However, I am now embarrassed I gave it to her, it didn't last very long. If you want something reliable, just get a normal manual pepper mill."
2,Would be great IF it worked,"I bought this for a gift and it worked great for less than a month. Refilling it is difficult but not a deal breaker. However, after refilling it only twice (not a lot of use) the motor's running but nothing's coming out. What a waste if we can't fix it because Amazon will not exchange or refund for it. I read another review that there's a small spring that comes off with refill and ends up in the grinds, can't find that either. (that was appealing). So I guess if you keep it operating it's super and we loved it but now it's broken it's a project to fix in the workshop."
3,Trudeau Graviti Batter-Operated Pepper Mil,"A very clever design, however, not so clever when the unit stops working due to jamming. ""Unjamming"" the pepper mill (to me) is a very difficult and frustrating ordeal and I think quality control should be ashamed for passing on a product without testing and working out the kinks."
2,"I don't think it's working- if it is, it stinks!","We just got it, and right out of the box, it's not working too well. It seems like it's struggling to find 'corns to grind- like it's skipping. Then a few very coarse grinds will come out... I'm tempted to return it, but I'm thinking I need to play with it more- though there's a lot of parts and I'm afraid I might render it completely inoperable. I just want an automatic one-handed pepper mill that works well... is that so wrong?"
4,Easy pepper mill,Purchased at AmazonI found this pepper mill to be very nice looking on the table setting and it is so easy to use. The grind of the pepper is just right for my husband and I.
1,Gravit Mill pepper grinder by Trudeau,"Quality control at Trudeau has seriously declined since we bought our first Graviti mill about eight years ago. That one finally quit working, so I naturally ordered the most similar model I could find. I ordered it online. It wouldn't work. I finally cobbled parts from the old one and the new one. I now have a grinder which is only acceptable at best. I really appreciated the original quality of this item. I recommended it to family and friends. Never again!Trudeau Graviti Battery-Operated Electric Pepper Mill, Chrome"
1,Did not work,"Ordered two for Christmas for my wife and the motors went when you turned them over, but nothing came out! I tried adjusting the grind size, Ended up returning them and going with a different company."
4,Just super for the price,"Excellent product, fantastic design. For the price, it is definitely not as sturdy as the over $100 electric mills available via Williams-Sonoma.Great addition to any kitchen especially if you suffer from arthritis in your hands but still wish for freshly ground pepper.It took me a while to figure out how to fill with peppercorns and not make a mess.Note: It takes 6-AAA batteries and if you use it every day, you'll be surprised at how fast you burn through batteries. However, one of the giant packs of batteries from Radio Shack will solve this problem."
1,Very Disappointing,"It was great when we first got it. However, it hasn't worked since the first time we needed to add peppercorns. It turned out to be a piece of junk. I am now looking for a new pepper mill after having this one for just about a month. Don't waste your time and money on this product."
1,JUNK,I received 2 of these as a Christmas gift last year. They did not make it to see the fat man this year. They looked like they would last... Nothing more than a novelty. Spend a little bit more and get a quality crank that grinds finer and faster.
5,Great Gift,Bought these as house warming gifts for two people and they really have bragged about them to others that told me about them.
4,Fun to use,"You only have to turn it over and pepper comes out. You can control the grind too. Mostly positive. It is difficult to open the bottom and then line it up again to close. Other reviewers warned about overloading the pepper, watch the fill line. I will do that. We are enjoying this!"
2,stylish but not functional,It looks great and gets many comments from dinner guests but it quickly became impossible to change the size of the pepper grains which it produces.
1,review of trudeau salt/pepper gravity mill,"At first we loved it. Then it began to jam. When we cleared the pepper, it worked for a while and then jammed again.Early on I had bought six for Christmas presents. I haven't heard from the recipients. I hope their's work better than mine.V.T. Abercrombie"
3,Cool in use but strangely unintuitive,"It's fun to watch and use but pretty noisy for what it does.Make sure you have six ""AAA"" batteries on hand when you get it. I'm embarrased to mention that I forgot to insert the batteries and wondered why it did'nt work.Filling it or changing the batteries involves removing the bottom cap which is is reverse threaded, you unscrew it clockwise. Once open, you use a pull tab to remove the motor and battery holder. Fill it with peppercorns or sea salt and reinsert motor and battery holder. Since it's upside down at this point it will immediately dispense pepper or salt until you reattach the bottom cap and turn it upright. The motor starts when it's held just past horizontal and there's no off switch.It holds quite a few peppercorns so you won't have to go through that rigamaroll often."
1,I hate I have to return it,I could never get the thing to make fine pepper. After adjusting all I could get was very coarse pepper to come out. That will not do so back it goes.
1,Quality is low compared to the past.,"I bought one of these mills about 5 years ago and used it many times a day for 5 year and it worked like a charm. It was ""GREAT""!With such heavy use, I half expected the mill to wear out, and it did.So I immediately purchased a new one from Amazon. The replacement didn't seem to grind as well as my first and the parts at the end of the mill seemed to contain more plastic with didn't line up well.Within 3 or 4 weeks the unit just failed completely. I used the same pepper that I had from the previous mill. I've been using the same pepper corns for the last 6 years, so I know it wasn't a problem with the kind of pepper I bought.There seem to be quite a few reviews which state that the mills don't last long.I suspect that the mills may have had some quality parts switched out to reduce the cost. The mills are much more affordable than they were 5 years ago."
1,piece of junk,"This pepper mill is a nothing but a piece of junk. I ordered two of them. The motor on the first one died within 10 seconds of putting the batteries in. On the second one, the motor is ""working"", but it is not turning the metal rod, so all you get is the motor noise and no grinds. The motor has all plastic, fine teeth gears - even if you get lucky and get it to grind a teaspoon before it dies, how long do you think that's going to last? Don't throw your money away on this bottom of the barrel ""made in china"" junk."
4,Just what a home chef's arthritic hands need from Amazon.,"I've always used a pepper grinder but they were manual. Osteoarthritis stopped all that, SO I found this at Amazon. The grind is a bit coarse (thus the 4 star) but the flavor is wonderful. Turn it upside down and you have flavorful, fresh ground black pepper."
2,bad copy,NOT sellers fault. Arrived exactly as described in unopened package but the quality looks as if it was copied from an old vcr tape to dvd. I hope I will be able to obtain a version that is of better quality.
3,"Crawling stages, I can respect that.","I liked this movie more as a kid than I do now. Back then I was blown away by the fight scenes, they are great. I need more depth now."
2,"American DVD review only, not the movie!","Fists of Fury was the name of the American release. The movie is cut and it's badly dubbed. Go out and find the import release titled The Big Boss. Not only is it uncut but it's in the original mandarin with english sub-titles, superior picture quality and it's properly formated in it's original aspect ratio 2.50.1. See it like you've never had before. The WB release is sub-par and about the same price as the import."
1,"NO-ONE SHOULD BUY THIS DVD, bad quality print - unwatchable","Amazon should not be selling this DVD. I have never seen anything of such appalling quality. It must have been recorded of a video, the last 15 minutes are unwatchable, the screen flickers, and has scrolling black and white lines all over the screen. Even apart from this, the quality is very blurry, and the sound is difficult to hear. It made me extremely cross having to watch (and pay for) such a good film in such bad condition. NO-ONE SHOULD BUY THIS!"
3,THIS IS ACTION,"Crude, amateurish Hong Kong Bruce Lee film from 1971 has resurfaced looking smart and entertaining in a movie drive-in second-feature sort of way. The Asian youth market made it a top-grossing hit as did the American market years later and there's no denying it's adolescent heroic appeal."
3,Skip Homeier,"Skip Homeier is always one of those what'shisname kinda actors. A face and acool, punk composure always familiar and hard to forget. A lot of guest roles in numerous series including WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE, PERRY MASON...andI'm just taking wild guesses here. It's a treat to see him in almost the main role in this one."
4,Her uncle's house,"I found it strange and jarring that the uncle and Robin didn't have even the barest conversation when they first met. It was basically, ""your room is upstairs."" Her whole relationship with the uncle was weird. The idea that she would be forced to move to Wisconsin for the three weeks leading up to her 18th birthday was also a little bit off.It was a relief to find that the author was 18 when the story was originally penned. That knowledge helped the story to fall into place. At first I thought the two potential boyfriends happened too quickly, but with her mother's death and a cold, remote and unknown uncle she was seeking a human connection.The mystery moved along, there were some surprises even for a jaded reader, it was clean with a few references to her faith, and it had a happy ending. All in all a good story."
3,predictable,"This its a fun, easy to read novel but I would not label it a Christian novel. Its g rated but the only Christian mention is going to mass. Much of the mystery is easy to guess, but even so I enjoyed this book."
4,Good :),"This is good, clean romantic suspense. After reading quite a few YA and younger audience books this year, it was nice to find a book that can bring forth a real romance, while managing to keep it clean. This book has an interesting plot and I thought the execution was handled well. The characters have dimension and the book moves at a good clip. The first couple chapters deal with the set up for the story, but don't be fooled, the book does get very interesting as it progresses. What I liked about this book the most was that the main character is strong and determined all the way to the end. Good book, if you are looking for a clean romantic read you don't have to be a teen to appreciate this."
3,too big for home use,"This is a great tool belt but it is for professional contractors. Wives, do not buy this for your husband if all he does is small jobs around the house."
4,High Quality,"It's always tough to tell what you're getting by looking at a picture. So, I was pleased when I received this tool belt to see that it was what I hope...high quality stitching, sturdy material, and otherwise as advertised."
4,Not good enough,It is a book with good recipes and very good discussion about sourdough starters but my expectancy was to have more about how to have the starter from scratch and solve problems in beginning the starter.
3,"Android ok, blackberry no go","Android phones will charge off it, but no luck with blackberry. As i have both types of phones, this is not a solution that works for me."
3,Not up to D MacOmbers usually excellent standards.,"I am a die-hard MacOmber fan, every one is a keeper here but... Moon over Water was not as good as Someday Soon or Sooner or Later. Wasn't as heart-warmingly sweet as either Promise Texas, Port Orchard or the Midnight Sons. I read it happily though, had to find out what happened to Jack."
5,The Sooner The Better (Deliverance Company),This book was excelent. It didn't take me long to read because it was so exciting and I wanted tofind out what happened.
2,Not as good as the Hype says.,"I did not find this book to be anything like the African Queen. It was slow reading and not very well put together. I found the dialog choppy, with really no humor at all. I've read MacOmber before and was very diappointed with this book. Hopefully, her next book will be better."
4,Right On Target...Great Stuff!!,"If you are easily offended, or are not familiar with the genre of extreame horror, you may find this volumne a bit grim, or offputting. Having said that, I LOVED it. Great stories that don't have some silly ""theme"" to tie them together, just cutting edge writing that will leave you weak in the knee's. Ketchum, Taylor and Lee's stories were great... well worth it. If you are worried about the kids, don't give them this one. :) Seeing a mass market edition of this suprised me and made me hopefull for the future of Main stream horror publishing. Keep up the good work! I can't wait for Darkside 2!"
2,kids happy...mom disappointed,"The Zurg action figure did not hold up very well. Within a week of owning it, the ironblaster fell off and the bottom on Zurg's body (the part with the wheels that rolls) came off and could not be glued back on. Also, from the day it arrived, the cape would not stay in place. My boys love the whole Toy Story 2 gang and were willing to accept Zurg with all his faults."
5,Very interesting,I must disagree. I found it a very enjoyable listening experience. Of course it is not jazz but it is inspired by jazz.
1,Very Disappointing,"Although I loved For Planets and Kings, and looked forward to reading Blue River, I found it tedious and monotonous. I thought the character development was limited and I didn't feel the involvement as I did with the character's in Canin's other book."
4,"I was hooked, it was great!!",The dancing drew me in but the story was a simple one of struggle and perseverance. I didn't really understand what was being said at first but I'm picking up things each time I watch it and I watch it often. I really enjoyed this movie.
5,Dancehall Queen,"Reply to Gail E. Clark ""The Jazzy One""The song is ""What's the Move"" by Chaka Demus and Pliers - madd-wicked!!"
4,A must,"This is a movie that I fell in love with immediately. I borrowed it from a friend once, and couldn't get enough- I've seen it so many times! There were parts of it that I felt could've been done better, but it overall definitely wins my praise. One thing I will say for those who are not of Caribbean descent is that it may be a little difficult to understand the language. Though I think that this significantly adds to the movie, one who does not speak Jamaican patois may have trouble. I myself am not Caribbean. I have many West Indian friends and listen to A LOT of reggae, so I understand patois pretty well. But even with that, it took me two viewings to get everything said. So if you don't speak or understand it, watch the movie with someone who does, or watch it repeatedly till you get it! Enjoy!"
4,"Functional, well-priced","A filter isn't a complicated endeavor, so it shouldn't cost an arm and a leg. That's why I like these. I bought a size too big accidentally, but cut it down to about half and its works just fine.Excellent price, good quality."
5,Must view,"This video should be required viewing for any entity that influences education in our country.1-Every school board member, principal and teacher.2-Every parent who cares about their child’s future placement in a competitive world.3-Our political leaders need to view this to come to the realization how the education or lack thereof will impact the future of our country."
2,Rather disappointing,"The film does expose much of what is wrong with the US's public education system, but then ultimately offers simplistic answers. The film is also largely gutless in dealing with the socio-economic issues. It instead argues that bad high schools create bad neighborhoods, but then contradicts itself when it gets to analyzing just how bad most of the education at suburban and rural schools is. The socio-economic issues are not limited to inner city schools, nor is bad education. This film tends to make the teachers looks like the causes even when it says it's trying to be fair. The one expert they interview the most is Canada and he himself is contradictory and a mixed 'bag'. No where does he or the filmmaker really give enough evidence that Canada and his people can scale up their approaches in order to provide a national solution."
2,This film has just four lessons..,"""Waiting For Superman"" has four lessons about education in America:1. The public education system is terrible.2. Teacher Unions are bad and the heart of all evil.3. Charter Schools are perfect and the answer to everything.4. Merit pay for teachers is a brilliant idea, although even its supporters can't explain how it will be implemented.(insert sigh here)"
4,Waiting for Superman,"Waiting for Superman is an interesting documentary about changes that are needed for our nation's schools. It did focus primarily on inner-city schools and painted a grim picture of schools. Personally, I know there are public schools with great teachers so one-size does not fit all. However, this documentary is a great supplement to a college class I teach for the chapter of School Effectiveness and Reform. Good discussions come from this."
4,"Incredibly infuriating, emotionally manipulative","It is difficult to come away from this film without feeling angry at the educational establishment. I know the filmmakers set out to manipulate me emotionally, and the succeeded in that goal. I would have appreciated a more balanced touch to the topic, but in the area where this focused, it was very effective."
1,Horrible movie that attacks the core of American public education,We can all learn a lesson about the evils of Michelle Rhee's philosophy. One just needs to look at the D.C. school district and the rampant cheating on test scores that took place in order to propagate her misguided ambitions. It's time to stop blaming teachers and time to start pointing at the parents who send their kids to school ill prepared and expect a babysitting service from college graduates.
1,Manipulation and bias,"This movie was ridiculous. There was not an interview with ONE teacher. Completely biased and anti-teacher and anti-public schools. Made me feel ill and worry about the future of education in this country.The ""heroes""in the movie include Michelle Rhea - utterly abrasive and obnoxious - and Geoffrey Canada - a complete phony. The ""villains"" are all teachers who do not subscribe to the director's beliefs.Don't bother to see it. No point in upsetting yourself."
5,"PARENTS, there is so much you can do!!!","This film goes to the heart of our society's issue; the systematic, epidemic killing off of our fantastic human potential by way of a failing educational system. A gigantic wake up call that needs to be seen by everyone and mostly parents. The fast moving train going in the WRONG direction known as our educational system may take a while to turn around AND PARENTS, THERE IS SO MUCH YOU CAN DO AT HOME WITH YOUR CHILDREN. Get educated on how to take advantage of the crucial early years that either ignite a child's genius and make him feel secure in himself and life or will simply take that away. Buy educational toys, spend time with your child, tell him he can do anything, expose him to all things in life and expand his mind!! Take parenting classes and realize you are the first and most important teacher of his life. And work on yourself as well... as we teach our children much more by who we are and what we do than by our words!!!"
4,A Sense of Place,"Myakka, by author P.J. Benshoff is a must read. She has created the kind of work that could only be done by someone who has a wonderful sense of place in an incredibly wild yet gentle land. She gives you the keys to secret places and adventures that are yours for the taking."
1,Not Enjoyable,"Bought this book for a class. If it had not been a required reading, I would have stopped reading it about 1/4 of the way through. Not enjoyable, in my opinion."
5,Great live performance,I've owned this CD for several years and listen to it often. After I ruined my last copy with scratches I had to replace it.
5,wonderful exciting action,This book was great it covered everything in it. love action etc. I would give it twenty stars if I could. I is the best book I have ever read.
1,This Book STINKS,"I was assigned to read this book for 8th grade summer reading. I cannot begin to tell you how boring it was and how dumb and stupid the storyline was. It used to many annoying egyptian phrases and words that readers could NOT understand, and it made the reader want to go to sleep. do NOT read this book PLEASE!!!"
1,BOO!,"This book was awful! Why do they publish books like these? It was extremely confuseing, and dull, and an unpleasent reading for me. The charactors were uninteresting, the plot was zooming in an awful direction! THis book made me hate to read, and since it was a school book I was nable to stop. Not one of my classmates enjoyed this book at all. Even for reading level it says 9-12, lets make that 65-80! I find books like this a terrible part of our world because it makes people dread reading. Why do schools make us suffer by reading this trash? So, if you are looking for a bad read, and an uninteresting plot, read Mara Daughter of the Nile. Rated B for Boring"
5,Wore it out!,"I found this in my school library when I was in 5th or 6th grade, and I checked it out over and over and over again the very first year I found it, way back in nineteen eighty-mumble. :) By the time the library card was finally replaced, my name was in all but 5 of the spaces. I loved this book so much. Like other reviewers, I am slightly peeved that the great queen-pharaoh Hatshepsut is made out to be a villain in this novel, especially as I was so interested in her that I did my history project on her reign. (But then, ever notice how Hatshepsut isn't even mentioned these days in all the Discovery Channel programs on Ancient Egypt.) Still, Mara's adventure is captivating and keeps you reading to see what will happen next. The final sequence had me white-knuckled the first time I read it, and I felt her fear and her pain even as I admired her courage. I highly recommend this book, and am very glad to see it's still in print after all these years! :)"
5,still a great story,"I read this story over and over again when I was young and have even named one of my daughters Mara after the heroine.This is still a great read with a clever heroine and strong secondary characters. Drama, Palace intrigue, a little romanceI'm so glad this is available for a new generation. Mara is one of the most memorable heroines around."
5,A Great Read!,"This book totally brought Egypt and its culture alive to me. Anyone who is interested in Egypt or just wants to read a great book that keeps them on the ""edge of their seat"" should definitely check into getting this book. Its a book you can read over and over again and never get tired of it! I would recommend this book for preteen to teenage girls, whether they like to read or not!"
1,not worth the money,"Though it is a beautiful looking stroller, and a very smooth ride, this product is definetly not worth the money. It is extremely heavy and doesn't fold very well. Seat must be taken out completely or facing forward in order for it to fold. The wheels are very far apart and don't go through doors of many stores and isles. The sun canopy doesn't cover very much and I often have to add a sheet of some sort to cover my baby's eyes from the sun.If you live in a city, definetly don't get this stroller-bad in small spaces, doesn't collapse easily, when folded it is very big and takes up a lot of space, and very heavy.Pros-comfortable seat and smooth ride"
1,Internal movement failed after 15 months,"I bought this watch as a wedding present for my husband. We were careful to make sure it received adequate light. After 15 months, the watch stopped working, and we were unable to restart it even following Citizen's recommendations. We have obtained estimates for repair from two different reputable watch repair services, both approximating $200. The watch is beautiful and has sentimental value, but I'm reluctant to spend the money on the repairs. Who knows how long it will work after that? I'm very disappointed as I thought this was going to be a reliable, life-long watch."
2,Too busy.,This is personal subjective opinion. Citizen echo drive are top of the notch design and manufacturing. Just it's very difficult for me to read time.
4,Great album by a great band,If you are interested in this album it won't disappoint. Do yourself a favor and get a copy from the bomp records website for $12 (shipping included).
5,A Kid's Opinion,Darren Shan is the best author in the whole wide world! He writes with so much intensity and detail it makes me shiver. I think that his topics on which he writes his books on are always very interesting and amazingly wonderful! I think the books he writes are for all ages and everyone should read it! What I like about this book is the way he tells the story. So intense you could say. Well that is all I have to say. Goodbye
4,Great New Age,album are wonderful from a music(Uman) With fine mix of rhythm instrumental beauties and vocal charms make this album truly unique and It adds a special touch to any A musical collection(Purple Passage)makes mark upon the world of New Age.
4,"I'm A Sucker for the Good, Good Stuff...","...I particularly like the Roy Orbison inspired ""New Kid in Town"". But my favorite is/has been/and will be for a long time ""Life in the Fast Lane"". It's the perfect rock song!"
3,Disappointing for SACD,"The positives: The price of this Japan-based SACD is very fair, and is what you'd pay direct from Japan. Audiophile disc retailers are charging around $50 for the same SACD. I own both this SACD and the SHM-CD version (also a Japanese pressing). What is odd is that the same producer did both versions, but the SHM-CD version is MUCH more musical. The SACD is ultra-clean and detailed, but the SHM version has greter ambience and richer tonality. There is more ""shimmer and chime"" to the guitars, and the disc has both detail AND warmth. I'm not sure what went wrong here--in my experience, SHM-CDs are usually very close to SACD, but lack some of the harmonic richness of SACD (though the differences are minimal). In this case, its the other way around. Grab the SHM-CD version from cdjapan before they're all gone. It's $10 cheaper and sounds better. How can you beat that?"
2,ONE HIT WONDERS ...,"To say that this CD is great .... is absurd !!! The gap between the sheer quality and creativity of the title track (HOTEL CALIFORNIA) and the rest of the songs in this trash is so enormous that you keep wondering if it were the same guys who recorded it !!! Even in the lyric department the difference is absurd. WHile ""HOTEL CALIFORNIA"" has substance and a different lyric, the rest of the song's lyrics is just plain cheesy (love, love, girls, heartbreak, and son on so on...). It seems some genius or saint appeared suddenly of the blue and gave the inspiration to the band write HOTEL CALIFORNIA. THen ther saint was gone and the band wrote the rest of the material..."
2,Overrated,"I like ""Pretty Maids All In A Row,"" ""Try And Love Again,"" and ""Wasted Time."" The rest you can have.Sorry..it's not in the league of Sgt. Pepper."
3,Just as good as a normal CD,I was expecting more sound channel diferentiation as a DVD Audio. It's not bad but for me is as a normal CD.
5,We Are All Just Prisoners Here Of Our Own Device,"This is their greatest album and one of the finest album of the 70s. Hotel California makes a grand statement about paradise lost and every cut is a cynical masterpiece. This CD could use some remastering and restore some of the original packaging elements. Twenty years later, the music retains all of its vitality and importance."
5,THE BEST TRACK EVER WRITEN,"I THINK ""HOTAL CALIFORNIA"" IS A MEANINGFUL YET EXCELLENT SONG. IT HAS SO MUCH TRUTH AND I COMMEND THE EAGLES FOR THAT!"
3,The book was okay,"Overall the book was just okay. It could have been so much better. As it is it's just okay. The tea parties were my favorite! It's so cute! I think the author could have done a better job towards the end of the book after he was revealed. If you just want to read a book, this one's okay. But if you're looking for something special I'd look somewhere else."
2,Predictable and prejudiced,"I am sorry I did not like this book, I wanted to kick the hero for being so selfish and the heroine for being so weak. I did finish it but only because I do not like to leave a book halfway through."
5,laugh out-loud funny,"A friend recommended this book and I'm glad she did. It was great. I normally shy away from first time authors, but this book broke all my previous beliefs. If this was Miss D'Alessandro's first, book, I can't wait to read her next one, although I don't know how much better she can get than this one. Congratulations on a fun-filled mystery that made me laugh and cry."
4,One of my favorites,"I thoroughly enjoyed Jacquie D'Alessandro's book, RED ROSES MEAN LOVE. Her characters were people that one could relate to and understand. Hayley and Stephen's story had me laughing, crying, and smiling. I sincerely hope that Jacquie D'Alessandro continues writing books such as R.R.M.L. and Whirlwind Wedding, which I liked even more than R.R.M.L. Keep up the wonderful stories!"
3,Loved her - hated him,"I enjoyed most of Jacquie D'Allessandro's Red Roses Mean Love. It offers good writing and despite predictable, but charming, secondary characters in scenes that are sometimes just too precious, a lot of laughs. But it has the most obnoxious hero I've met in ages. Although Hayley, the heroine, is sweet and too good to be true, I was willing to go along with her because I liked her courage and grace. But she's wasted on Stephen. He's mean and boorish and turns nasty at the most inappropriate times. If he's thinking about anything but himself it sure doesn't come across! And Hayley forgives this creep! How does this help women in the real world? D'Alessandro has a lot of talent, but should have used it to create a hero that we can admire. He's the only drawback to a fun read, but he ruined the book for me."
2,outdated,"I bought this book before checking the publication date. Some of the info is relavent, but most of it misses the mark with the current epidemic of pain med addiction."
5,Gooood Movie,"I am very happy with my purchase. I like this movie ""Sling Blade"" and glad that I bought it.Thank you."
5,Billy Bob's Shinning Moment!!,His screenplay was given a well deserved Oscar. But this movie was really an outstanding achievement in acting portrayal. You never would have know that the lead character was Thornton. He shines as the mentally retarded man who befriends a boy he shares a house with. Country Singer Dwight Yoakam is incredibly good as the boy's abusive step father. And John Ritter is great in a non-comical role. It's a moving drama that I thought was one of the best films of 1998. Outstanding!!
4,Billy Bob deserved his Oscar with this film,"This is the first time I can remember seeing Billy Bob Thornton on film. I didn't know what to make of him at first, but he proved himself a good actor and that made me want to see him in other films. Kudos to country singer Dwight Yoakam on his performance! I was more than happy to add this film to my dvd collection. You should enjoy this one!"
5,"Well,Alright then!","This is a wonderful film, and not what you would expect from the title.It definitely is no ""slasher"" story. The character of Carl is so finely tuned and so honest, it stays with you from the second you see him.You won't ever forget him. I admit I enjoy the scenes with Frankie the most. Carl's love for the boy, and the interaction between them, is what really drives this film. All the performances,however, are beautifully realized."
1,Baffled,"I just don't get it. People have been raving about this wretched little excuse for a movie for nearly three years now, and such estatics just don't make sense. The plot is extremely simplistic, the characters woefully clinched, and yes, the acting is so bad it can't even qualify as an Ed Wood film. Billy Bob Thonrton's performance is one note. He slouches and grunts and this is supposed to be what passes for great acting.I adore independent film, but this one is a major dog people. Avoid at all costs."
1,WILDLY implausible...,"...and totally self indulgent filmmaking. One-note performance from Thornton (whom I've liked in other films), up there with Sean Penn's performance in ""I Am Sam."" If you liked that, you may enjoy this. I just kept yelling ""WHAT?"" at the unmotivated actions of the characters.From the first incident, in which a middle-aged formerly homicidal mental patient, incarcerated since the age of 12, is released into society with NO placement services and is expected to fend for himself, right through to the signaled-way-ahead-of-time totally predictable ending, this is just an illogical mess.""Oh, you've just been released from a mental institution, have struck up a friendship with my adolescent son, and need a place to stay? Well, by all means, move in with US!""Can't understand the critical praise heaped on this mess. Oh yeah, and the self-conscious camera work doesn't help either.If you like logic and emotional coherency, skip this one."
2,OK if you get an accurate set,"These work well and seem to survive washing in the dishwasher. The problem is that of the 4 I received in the set, only 3 were reasonably accurate. One was off by about 15 degrees. I'd give them 5 stars if Taylor had bothered to test them and make sure that they were accurate before packaging them. You can test them yourself like I did and throw away the bad one(s). But, you shouldn't have to do that."
3,Good,"I like it, it's good, OK the pic on his back , not so good, he's a little undurable but this toy is cool."
4,Makes me wonder:,"""starring former adult actress Jasmine St. Claire""Makes me wonder if they have any video footage of her 'banging' to this stuff = THAT WOULD BE A GRAND THING TO SEE AND EVEN MORE SO TO EXPERIENCE IT IN REAL LIFE!!!laughingpig1@yahoo.com"
3,VAMPIRES REVISITED!,"I have read all of this man's vampire books, and the Necroscope novels are some of THE BEST stories in terms of sheer excitement and just plain good, fun reading today. DEFILERS, though not one of the best of this authors works, is still a fun and interesting chapter in the ongoing fight against the bad ol' Whampyrie vampires. New levels of storytelling and ongoing character development was sure apparent in this book. I hope that the next novel, (the last-darn-it), carries us back to the vampire world of sunside/starside, which is where this author does his best work in my opinion. I like the new necroscope Jake Cutter and his love interest Liz Merrick, but they are hardly together in this novel, but they are surrounded by other E-branch people who all have their own unique powers which is always fun to read. I reccommend this book highly and am waiting eagerly foe the final showdown and book in this long-lasting series."
2,Disappointing,I thought this was the weakest of the Necroscope series. Lumley is trying to turn his vampire stories into romances. He spent way too much time describing his lovely women and the virile Jake. I yawned! Where's the action???
5,"Great product, wouldn't be without it",I take this everyday. It even helps with lower blood pressure. I have double up during my current diet.
3,Not exactly what I expected.,"I did not know the hardcover would turn out to be a hardcover a little smaller than a mass market paperback. It is well made, but when I order a hardcover book, I expect a library-size edition."
3,Fairy tales and other stories,"I like the characters of the witches but just don't like the stories that they are featured in. Other reviewers think Magrat is a weak character. I think the character of Granny is the problem. She and Nanny preach empowerment to the other female characters in the book, ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""Cinderella"", and ""Little Red Riding Hood"" and yet they knock Magrat down every chance they get. It became very tiresome in this book. This book is very funny though and is a quick, easy read."
1,boohbah,"Maybe little kids will like this show, but I have watched it and its the most retarded television show in the world's history! Compare it to the cartoons from 30 years ago aimed at the same age group, and you'll find that they were far more...well...complicated! Kids must be getting increasingly dumb. Anyway, this show is about these big puffy aliens that these little kids worship and send gifts to by blowing on the gift until it goes up in the air. And in between there are these little stories with Grandpapa and Grandmama and Brother and Sister, which obviously must be made for very dumb children because they are entirely about some very simple thing like these kids jumping in a giant, squeaky sock...then grandpapa is listening to the sound and doesn't know what it is for a minute...then he finds out and they all do silent laughter.So only get this if you have very young kids, like infant-2 years."
1,A Self-Indulgent Mess,"I watched this film in amazement that it is somehow considered important or new. It is just a rehash of the 1960s with spoiled middle class children attacking their ""bourgeois"" and ""fascist"" society while managing not to work. There certainly is terrible prejudice against the mentally ill,but this film exploits it. If you want to change things you must have real talent and make a film about what it really feels like to be mentally ill. Having no talent is no longer enough i'm afraid."
1,Written by a middle school student,"The only excuse I can come up with for this book is that is was written by a 13 year old. The vocabulary, style, and mechanics would earn a B- in any 8th grade general education Language Arts class. The plot, what little there is, is convoluted and inconsistent; the science behind the story is non-existent.Granted, this book was written in 1979...but that's little consolation for the reader who makes it to the end of Sub Zero."
2,Not very good,"The seasoning on the flatbread is minimal, about 1/3 to 1/2 of each piece is covered in seasoning. Of the seasoning that is there, it is not spicy at all.The unseasoned portion isn't very tasty and reminded me of drywall.They packages arrived with about 1/3 of each pack broken. I would not recommend."
2,not really that great,"I had read lots of great reviews about this movie, but it's got too many plot holes and unbelievable events that spoiled it for me. I tried to like it, but there were just too many instances where the events were ridiculous.It was well made in an a hollywood action movie way, but if you care for even somewhat believable plots (even james bond level), you'll be insulted by this one."
5,Good Action Thriller,I thought this was a well done movie. It was interesting to see a Korean version of an American Action Blockbuster. It also provides an interesting brief glimpse of life in North Korea. It may not be realistic but not any less so that many American counterparts.
2,Lame Hollywood Wannabe,"South Korea's first serious attempt at imitating a Hollywood blockbuster is exactly that -- an imitation. And a real clumsy one at that. ""Shiri"" recycles every action movie cliché imaginable that I felt like I was watching a James Bond highlight (lowlight?) reel most of the time. The plot is laughably bad and predictable, and the acting and dialogues are even worse (not having to read the subtitles isn't always a blessing). If you want to see a real South Korean blockbuster, I suggest you check out ""Joint Security Area"" instead."
2,"Unfortunately let down, a first time for Canon","I've long been a fan of and advocate for Canon products, but this printer is a let down, and will be returned.The primary problem is consistency. I've printed the same photo 5 times (it comes with an ink cassette and ""postcard sized"" paper for 5 prints), each time the resulting print has some errors, generally yellowish blotches, a speck here and there. etc. It seems like it could be caused by what would have to be microscopic dust, but that's speculative.Unflawed portions of the photo look fantastic, but you wouldn't want to have them framed or on display... which is another problem, and is mistakenly written off by some reviewers. The paper it prints on is not standard size. A 'borderless' image, at least with the supplied Canon paper, ends up cropping portions of the photo, and the usable section is 5.8"" wide, because of the perforations.Confused what purpose this serves unless you love to send custom postcards... a lot?"
1,Too expensive to use.,I got this for free when I bought my MacBook at the Apple store. Not at all happy with it. Just to expensive to use regularly.
1,Check box carefully,"When I opened the box I was disappointed because it lacked: USB plug; power plug; CD-ROM; and Instruction book. It came from Action Package, Inc., and was supplied by Wall Street Photo.When I contacted them they said it was checked before being sent (which I doubt)and would refund postage only. I live overseas so it is difficult to return items on time.Dr glenn in Manila"
2,BROKE AFTER 1 YEAR,"This printer was awesome...while it worked. I had it for a year and used it pretty regularly, but not so much that I would expect it to break so quickly. The loading wheels on the printer would no longer pick-up the paper, telling me that I was out of paper. I was disappointed not only because I really liked this printer, but Canon's customer service solution was to buy a new one. I have always been a huge fan of Canon products, but now I am thinking twice about buying them in the future."
4,The calling of Emily Evans,"Great book. Full of faith, hope, and love. Can't wait to read more. Keeps you wanting more to read. Bravo!"
5,The Calling of Emily Evans,This was one of my favorite books. I think the author is very good andI will read more of her books.
5,Very inspiring,"This is the first book that I have read by Janette Oke. I enjoyed it so much that I am anxious to read her other books. Her main character, Emily, never shrunk from obstacles that she encountered but stayed true to her calling. I thought the request for her to prepare a body to be buried and the fact that she carried it through was a little unrealistic considering that she was described as a sickly, slight person and had never done that task. Emily depended on God's help because of her sense of His call to service and her needs were supplied."
3,oky dokey,It was good and Especially because it was free. It was a good read. Very good for that time frame.
4,Pretty good,This was a little different from other Oke books that I have read which made it a little more interesting to me. The outcome was still very predictable however.
5,"Loved this book,",I really got into this book and can't wait for the next one. It was a wonderful story from start to finish.
5,M Derrah,I have always loved Janette Oke's writing. This book has not disappointed me. It also gives me a greater appreciation of what church workers had to deal with in the younger years of the church here in the America's.
3,Sweet story,No surprises but a sweet story nonetheless. I would read more of her books if given the opprotunity. wouldn't say she' be a favorite though!
3,Vdr@hotmail54,"Have read many of her books in the past. Sweet, easy to read and always glorifying God. Look forward to finding more of her books to enjoy."
3,The calling of Emily Evans,"This book was inspiring as well as an introspective analysis of f a religious philosophy. The book forced one to look internally. Perhaps, not the most intellectually stimulating."
5,A great example of obedience,"This is actually the second time I have read The Calling of Emily Evans. As good as I remember it being, I see so much more truth this time. Janette Oke has long been my favorite author and she solidifies that title with this book. The simple truths of a life lived sold-out to our Savior, of one who has a living, breathing, and vital relationship with Jesus, are shown so clearly in this story. The calling of Emily Evans is an example to Christians of any age of what God can do through someone who will simply obey and trust. It is also a reminder of the pioneers of faith who have paved the way for those of us who follow the Lord today. Thank you for a wonderful reminder and window into their journey."
4,I think I would have loved this book.,I loved the Christian themes that were presented throughout the book. I loved Emily's devotion to God and her many acts of unselfishness. I was interested in knowing if she would find a man to share her life with who loved God as much as she did. I didn't get to find out. The book wouldn't move past 92%. I read almost the entire thing and couldn't find out how it ended. What a bummer!
5,Spike as a puppet doll,"I have to admit my heart belongs to Angel but I was excited to see Spike made into a ""puppet"" plush doll( he's not really a puppet). Years ago, I was curious one day and thought how cool it would be to make all of the Angel characters into puppet dolls so I googled Smiletime Puppet and that's how I found out about Spike. Quite a few of my online friends were diehard Spike fans so they were beyond excited about my find. My Spike doll is out of his box and sitting with Angel on a shelf. They look really cool. The details are amazing. Next, I'd like to see Cordelia made into a puppet doll.~"
4,"Strong, soulful","Edgar Winter brings Texas grit and funk, mixes it with gospel choirs and straight-ahead rock and roll. This is a band that could and did play anywhere from the Apollo to the Fillmore West. Rough, yet polished, sweet and mean, the White Trash were a serious experiment in American Music. From the gospel-esque ""Fly Away"" to Ray Charles' ""I've Got News For You"" to the rocking ""Let's Get It On"", this band kicks it into a soulful groove. There's a beautiful poem/intro in the liner notes by Patti Smith as well."
4,Legends:::Tony Orlando & Dawn,Excellent. Really enjoy listening to this and all the other songs I went through high school listening to on the wireless GREAT STUFF........
5,Kick back w/ a can of Faygo and enjoy ...,"Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope have outdone themselves this time. This album has a little bit of everything. All out good rhymes, comedy, and a drop of Crazy Killer Clowns. Those ingredients make this album a must have. The Great Milenko is the fourth in a series of a six album set that the ICP plans to release. Each album depicts a ""Joker Card"" which represents a figure of great evil in our lives. The Great Milenko is the fourth of these Joker Cards and represents such evils as greed, temptation, jealousy, and lust."
5,ICP Music Fan From MO,"I borrowed ""Great Milenko"" from my boyfriend and it kicks major butt!!!! My favorite songs on ""Great Milenko"" are ""What Is a Juggalo?,"" ""Boogie Woogie Wu,"" and ""The Neden Game."" ""The Neden Game"" is a song that is great and also funny! If you don't have ""Great Milenko"" buy it NOW!!!!! I promise you, you WILL NOT regret buying it!!!!!!!!!"
5,ICP KICKS *SS,This is the absolute best CD out there and of course the best ICP CD. All U Juggalos out there better by this one quick.
1,hey clowns go back to the circus,Insane Clown Posse are so annoying i can't stand them. Don't feel bad new kids on the block you can still beat them up. It's pain to my ears to hear this trash.
1,for the easily amused,"this cd isnt worth the money it cost to have it packaged. these two guys are makin money off people who are so willing to cling on to some kind of so called higher thinking...any amount of religious signifgance that they put into theyre rhymes is completely thrown away by the fact they produe these joker cards and the meaning behind them...they also try to make a big deal about racism...always telling of the evil of racism and writing songs about killing racist rednecks...thats great, but then they turn around and write songs degrading women...this isnt rap, its not rock, its not metal...its two guys that the intelligence to know how to make money of nieve listeners...if you insist this is rap, pick up some real music, mos def, talib kweli, common...and maybe you can learn what writing rhymes is all about"
5,one of the best,I am about to buy my third copy of this CD--I keep giving away my copy to friends because I want them to hear this awesome music.
5,I don't care who you are; this CD is a must have.,"I purchased this CD over a year ago after I heard it in a coffee shop, but it wasn't until I started taking Brazilian Portuguese this past September that I realized that this album is a masterpiece. I wasn't a true fan of bossanova until I listened to this album. I also bought Red Hot + Rio when it first came out, which is an album of contemporary covers of Jobim's more popular songs, and they all sound so much better now that I have heard the originals. I listen to all types of music, from hardcore to rap, and I am not kidding you when I assure you that no matter what your tastes, you will find something to like about this album. Dindi makes me melt everytime I hear it."
3,"OK, but kind of on the primitive side.","This collection reminds me of an old DOS game from the '80s. The graphics are pretty limited by today's standards, and the interface is a little klunky. The main menu is organized by categories that don't do a very good job of telling you where to find a specific game - you have to just poke around until you find it. As another reviewer noted, some items (gamepieces, etc.) are so tiny it's really difficult to make them out. (I'm looking at you in particular, Mahjong)You can download the PSP version from the PSN Store for ten bucks, so paying twenty to thirty here probably isn't your best move. For ten bucks, it's definitely worth having. Much more than that would be hard to justify given the relatively low quality of this collection compared to PC collections like Microsoft's Bicycle Board Games or Infogrames' Milton Bradly-branded version."
4,Far Out and Away,"I am not a fan of sci-fi, or even paranormal, but I have become a fan of Haakon Jones, intrepid adventurer and knight errant extraordinaire. Though he piously insists he ""ain't lookin' for no trouble,"" trouble with a capital T seems to follow his every footstep. Aaron Larson's blend of humor, myth and derring-do is irresistable and I was pinned to the pages as Mr. Jones rescues maidens in distress, discovers cities of gold, conquers dragons and generally covers himself with glory in one breathtaking escapade after another.A terrific read for summer under a shady tree--or in front of a cracking fire in the winter."
2,Not much fun,"I gave this as a gift to my grand daughter. It captured her attention for about ten minutes. I'm not saying your child might not find it interesting, but it bombed as a gift with me."
2,Time waster,"When I type in an idiom, even a common one, I am given dozens of locations to check out, and usually the idiom is not to be found in any of the offers. Apparently the system is not set up to dig up entries, but if the combination of words within the idiom are to be found in one or two adjacent sentences no matter the sequence, the location will be given as one I should check out. Given 6 at a time, it takes a considerable amount of time to go through 172 possibliities, only to find that none of them is the idiom, but merely a coincidental inclusion of all the words of the idiom within two adjacent, but disrelated sentences. Only once did the idiom I was looking for turn up, and it is a Canadian idiom I have not found in most other idioms dictionaries. That's what rated the two stars instead of none!"
2,Exercise in pointlessness,"This might have worked in French (and in fact Share's French is immaculate); in English the pretension is as laboured as the humour eventually becomes. An arid writer's exercise, alas, in which the solitary female, caricature though she is, provides the only glimmer of life. (For a possibly more measured view, see my comments on Amazon.co.uk.)"
3,Spiderman Laptop,My son loves it! And I think that is great but the letter E and U don't work and the off button does not work either. Since it is the day after Christmas I can't exchange it for a new one because they are all out.
5,THIS BOOK IS AMAZING. THE REVIEWS ARE SPOT ON!,This book took my headaches away. I had them every day before I started this diet. Now I am off of all of my medications and my life has changed.I will be forever grateful to Dr. Buchholz for writing this book.
5,Lifesaver,"I have suffered migraines for 30 years and this book has been a revelation. Dr Bucholz has a deep intuitive understanding of migraines and those who suffer from them. Reading this book was like talking to someone who, for the first time in my life, absolutely understood what I was experiencing. The advice is both practical and holistic. It's important to follow it (what price regaining control of your life?). I can't recommend this book highly enough and hope it offers the relief to others that it has to me."
5,"Heal Your Headache, the 1, 2, 3 Program","This book helped me realize I was only making my headache problem worse with the ""quick fix"". It is not an easy program to follow but it is making a difference. Some of the assertions may sound a bit much but overall it works."
5,Heal Your Headache: the 1-2-3 Program,"Buchholz's book is the best advice I've received as a migraine sufferer of 24 years. So much of his advice finally explains things such as why a food like chocolate will cause a headache one time and not another (""the threshold effect""). I never understood why I could never find a pattern to my headaches. He will convince you that it is worth it to do the no-headache diet. After a short period of mourning the loss of some of my favorite foods (I thought I'd have to go to Betty Ford to get off chocolate!), I realized that after a few grueling trips to the grocery store to read labels, it became easier. Each time I excitedly found more foods I could eat. Now that I'm on maintenance, I've added in several items on the no-headache list, just in smaller quantities. In a nutshell, the book has been a Godsend to me. Even if you just take one piece of his advice, I think you'll find the book well worth it."
4,Helped a lot,"I followed the plan to a T, for about a month. I was having about one or two migraines a week. Now I have maybe one a month, I also have gone off the plan a bit too, I know most of my triggers now so I avoid them always. It's definitely worth a try, packed with a lot of great info. It has drastically improved my life. I have been improved now like this for about 3-4 months now."
4,S. Becker,"I have suffered with migraines since my early twenties. In the Spring of 2006, they became chronic, lasting almost 5 months. After unsuccessful visits with two neurologistists and many different meds.I was losing hope. Five months of pain had left me confused and deeply sad.In Oct. I started Dr. B. 1,2,3 program. I gave up all the foods and then some, that I thought might be triggers for me. I didn't get better the first few weeks, until I eliminated the coffee. That was hard! It took a week after that and boom! my headaches were gone. I cried I felt so much better. I still get a few migraines each month but they are less intense. I treat them with Naproxen. I'am in the process of fine- tuning my prevention medicine. I believe I would be even better by now but I'am having problems with the side effects.I'am very grateful for Dr. B. book. It hasn't been a cakewalk, but the program makes sense and has worked for me."
3,MY First Paul Gallas video,"I was excited to use this product using my spin bike at home. My expectations were cut short due to the following:- First 30 mins of the video which is climbing the ""Hump"" was pretty intense, but as you go over pass the ""Hump"", it was downhill from there. There were some small hills which makes you work harder but other than that, you're ""spinning"" to the end.- Paul has a riding partner, but you don't see him through out the ride, but with commentary on, you'd hear them both talking about how he (the riding partner) became an avid cyclist/triathlon). I was hoping they would talk more about some technics along the way.- Music was OK. Need more upbeat.This won't be the last time I'd buy his video, i will try another one that might be harder/more intense to get me really workout on my spin bike."
1,Horrible Marketing Decision,I too ordered this from Amazon and received the Power version of the product. I noticed that the stores were no longer carrying the light green cap version and went to order online. I was a long-time user of the light green version and I am really upset if Menen discontinued this product. What a horrible marketing decision on their part. Now all the loyal users will look to other brands becuase the Power version is terrible. Colgate should read the business case history of New Coke. What a marketing disaster that was. I wonder how much market share Pepsi gained during the New Coke replacement of the original formula. The same could happen to Colgate.
4,Cha Cha,"Just wanted to mention, although you can't hear the sample here, Mean Spirited Sal is a hilarious song and a *great* cha cha (!)"
3,Not as good as the earlier albums,"This album sounds as though the record label wanted to market what began as an inside joke among a few musicians as a serious band. The music on this album along with Johansen/ Poindexter's voice is great, but lets face it he didn't start this project to be the next Bob Dylan. The appeal of the Buster Poindexter project to me was always that it allowed a great performer to simply perform so good bar music with no major message and have fun. The album is not bad it's just unnessesary.It reminds me of some of the lesser known Reverand Horton Heat albums."
2,Good charger -,This is a good charger - quick and portable. But the battery life of the battery SUCKS!
4,Quality product but not the easiest to mount,The reel is a very well made unit. Quality throughout. I only wish that the mount was a bit more universal for lining up the holes to morter joints on brick surfaces. It appears that this product will last forever.
5,Great Product!,I am very impressed with this product as I have used similar plastic products in the past with great dissatisfaction. The wife and I couldn't be happier.
2,Rapid Reel Garden Hose Reel,"I bought four of these garden hose reels but they leave much to be desired. If there was a better way of connecting the garden hose to the reel plumbing they would be good hose reels. However, I have not figured out a good way to connect the garden hose to the reel plumbing using the method provided by Rapid Reel! I plan to have a welder friend build a metal adapter to connect the reel plumbing to the garden hose such that the garden hose can be connected inline with the reel, which will eliminate the problem of the hose kinking and make the winding of the hose on the reel work more smoothly! This is something Rapid Reel's engineering department ought to have given more to when they designed the hose reel . . . very poor design. I wish had had bought four more of the Ames True Temper hose reels instead of these Rapid Reel hose reels!"
5,Extemely pleased again,This is my second Rapid Reel product and I have yet to be disappointed. I bought the two wheel cart version of this hose reel 3.5 years ago and that is still working perfectly too.
2,A disappointment for this collector,The images in this book are very commercial presentation of semi nude males. The settings and costumes are very contrived. I was disappointed in the presentation of males presented here. I'd suggest investing your money elsewhere for quality male nude photography.
5,Great dishes,I got these dishes as a gift and I really love them. They are dishwasher safe and microwaveable and I think that is great for beautiful dishes. They are great for holidays and the colors can go with any occasion. They are very sturdy and they are gorgeous on the dinner table.Hope you enjoy them as much as I have.
3,For older children,"This book is well-written and explains why we should recycle in a creative way. However, it does not rhyme and therefore gets a little dull to read. It is long and not very exciting. More suitable for kids over 8 or 9."
5,Are You Kidding Me?,This has to be the best AMT album in recent memory. What a psych-rock masterpiece. Highly recommended.
1,product not received,"Hi,I have yet not received the product. it's almost a month since the payment has been made. Please expedite or intimate progress."
4,We love it,"We ordered this as a basic conference phone for our small business, and it has more than served our needs. The sound quality is good on both ends and no one complains about hearing us, or us hearing them. In retrospect we might have ordered a unit with a headphone jack of some sort, due to some shared office/conference space, but that is not a problem with this unit, but our choice in purchase. Would recommend!"
5,Still loving my Peacy Lily,"I searched online for the perfect desk plant since my new workspace needed some color and life and read about the easy-to-care-for peace lily. To my surprise, they sold this very affordable and true-to-picture on Amazon and shipped directly to my work in great condition.I've had my plant for 9 months and what I love is that even some weeks it's not looking so happy (my fault), just a bit of water picks it right back up almost instantly.Item will arrive as just the plant, a handful of starter soil and a plastic base container, so you'll want to have another more decorative and permanent pot as well as potting soil ready when this guy arrives."
1,You don't get what you order!,"Be careful when ordering this item. Though the ""See Larger Picture"" illustration clearly shows 4x, 8x is shipped. Some recorders, mine for example purchased only 3 months ago from Amazon, state in two places ""This machine will not record on 8x discs""."
5,good deal,"Fast service. For a book so old, it was in really good shape and a hard to find item. My son loved it.."
5,A Goldmine !,"If you`re a music fan that wants to discover the genius of Lee Perry , or simply someone that wants to own an instant classic reggae collection , this is the place to start .This boxset contains 4 hrs worth of some of the greatest music to have come out of the legendary Black Ark studio , and therefore Jamaica in the Seventies . Tracks such as "" Police And Thieves "" , "" War In A Babylon "" , "" Roots Train "" , "" Chase The Devil "" , and "" Tedious "" have reached near mythical status whilst everthing else in this collection is a reggae classic in its own right . The 52 page booklet that accompanies this set only reinforces the fact that this is one of the greatest reggae/dub compilations ever to have been released . BUY IT !"
5,"Great product, easy to install","I ordered this wall mount to hang a 32"" monitor for our conference room at work. I had read many of the reviews of this product before hand and the vast majority of them were very favorable. The wall mount was very good quality and very easy to install. The extension arm allows us to easily retract the monitor when not in use and to pull it out and angle it as we wish for presentations and webcasts.Highly recommend this product."
1,No Scorates Here,"I found it hard too see how lying is supposed further the cause of creationism, but this book lays it out. Argue to confuse -- not the opponent, though. No, argue to confuse those who lack the intellectual apparatus to know what is being discussed. If you can keep THEM confused, you can have them consider the subject open. It isn't."
2,bad sound quality,"Here in Europe you can already buy this cd and the quality of the sound is poor. But if your a Metallica fan, then you just have to have this in your collection !"
3,For Metallica collectors only for completion,"This CD is nothing special. I did not know what it really was when I bought it. I thought this was a 'live' album and not a dubbed copy of 'No Life til Leather' with fake crowd noise. Still, collectors would probably want this just for the absurdity of it all.I am a huge fan of Cliff Burton and do not even consider Metallica as a band without him, but this early lineup with Dave and Ron is great to hear because it was a great time for metal before Larz and Jaymes turned into a couple of self indulged pus bags."
2,Interesting Anecdotes-There are Better Public Speaking Books,"Being a minor political junkie, I enjoyed this book more than my 2 star rating might indicate. Ms. Noonan has been writing speeches for (mostly conservative) politicians for many years, and has a wealth of fun stories to tell about that experience.However, that's not why I bought the book - I purchased it to try to improve my public speaking skills, as the book's title implies would be its purpose. On that note, it doesn't come close to other books on the same topic.If you want to read some of the interesting political anecdotes, this may be worth a look. If you're looking for a good book on public speaking, look elsewhere."
4,A READER from St. Cloud Mn. was wrong...,"A READER from St. Cloud MN. was wrong in their review of Ms. Noonan's work. She did use political references, but only as examples and never in a mean way. She provided pro and cons of various speeches given by both Democrates and Republicans. I found her to be straight forward and helpful. I would recommend this audio program to anyone regardless of their political leanings. Heck, she even gave Carvill high praise."
3,shipped quick,arrived in a cheap bag rather than the traditional flannel sack; however it did ship fast and happy for that!
2,"Not the best, not the worst.","Old ladies seem to like it on me. Maybe that's because it smells like I rolled in potpourri. At least it doesn't announce it's presence before you do. Decent longevity. If you work in a nursing home or are visiting grandma, a sample vial of this would do you good."
2,Disspointed,When this cologne was popular I would use it liberally and it smelled great.Not so today.I purchased it sort of like you would buy an oldie music album. Nostalgia modivated me.But the smell is more alcohol then aromatic scent that I remember it being.If you get nostalgic for Grey Flannel buy an old music CD instead.
3,Love the scent but doesn't last all day,It goes on strong but weakens fairly quickly. I bought this because some reviews talked up the Patchouli notes but they are not as strong or dominate as I would like. Very masculine. My wife loves it.
4,intriguing look into Victorian era life,"James Ruddick's ""Death at the Priory"" examines an English murder of more than a century ago. The cast of real-life characters rivals any fictional story, and Ruddick's carefully crafted reconstruction of the death of Charles Bravo will keep you turning pages. He presents a strong case for his theory of events, although there are still no definite answers. His insights into the lives and motives of the suspects are well written.This slice of Victorian life among the English wealthy class will open your eyes to the then prevailing attitudes about women, gender roles, property rights, and family life of that era. Women's lives were circumscribed by rigid norms, and those few who went against those norms, like Florence Bravo, the young wife of the dead man, faced strong sanctions. Highly recommended, an excellent read."
1,Crap!,"Do not waste your money. These handles are made of a hardened plastic. They have no pliability and 3 of them cracked during installation. If you can get them on without breaking them, your pot will look like a cheap ""camping"" pot. High gloss and overall cheap appearance."
1,Not worth the money,"The handle is made of brittle plastic, and broke before I could even attach the screw. Poor design, lousy product."
5,Just what i was looking for!!!,I have had handless pots for quite some time and been looking for handles that would fit my lifeware pots. My husband had to drill out the holes a little bit bigger to accomodate that size of screw my pots took but they fit now and are great!
3,"Big, strong, and comfortable, but what is that smell?","We bought one of these cots for visitors, having had it recommended highly by friends. It is very sturdy and comfortable, especially if you add a sleeping pad. A big complaint though: it smells really bad. We unpacked it and put it out on the porch two days ago hoping that it will air out. So far it has not. We'll give it some more time; I find it hard to believe that anything that smells this bad could stay on the market so I am assuming that the smell will eventually go away (similar to what happens with memory foam products). The manufacturer should include information about this for their customers. If they had included a note explaining the smell (and if it does indeed go away), I would rate this cot 5 stars."
5,Great single,"Geri Halliwell's ""Ride It"" was definetly one of the best pop tracks of 2004! It is an up-tempo catchy pop track, and all 3 of the remixes are great! The ian masterson mix is my fave, it is the original version of the song extended to 6:35! It is even better than the original, and a great mix. The maloney remix doesnt have many vocals in it, but the beat is irresistable! and the Hex hector mix gives a bit of a tribe feel, but it is still dance. The extras are availbile through a secret link, https://secure.digitalinsert.com/competition.cfm?promotion=121 The video is campy and fun, and all the other extras are also great."
3,Immediate Help,"This book gives immediate, practical suggestions for urgent behavior problems. It falls short in explaining the WHY of child behavior. Often, normal child development causes the common, troublesome, behaviors; sometimes a parent's response perpetuates a child's behaviors; occasional stress in the home environment or a child's inborn temperament explains his actions. These ""behind-the-behavior"" dynamics should be considered before employing corrective measures.This book could be more helpful if it included some background insights into child behavior so parents are empowered with understanding and not only with the mechanics of stopping a particular behavior.For another useful resource on childrearing see The Birth to Five Book: Confident Childrearing Right from the Start"
3,not bad,I enjoyed the book and it was at the right price ( free) .The story's where short and some art could improve on the book .
1,Not what I was expecting.,"The first page of the story made me stop reading. I was looking for actual stories on Norse mythology, not a biased Christian fluff book."
4,Norse mythology,Great collection of Norse stories. A great way to get your feet in mythology and especially the tales of A share.
4,Very stylish,I bought this pair of flip flops for my husband. They are very stylish. We fly to Mexico for a week every year. These shoes look great on the beach. They also pack easily. And I think the black color looks great in the evening when we go out.The price on Amazon was the best I could find online.
5,"Use it on wheel hubs, lug nuts and spark plugs...","This Permatex anti-seize is excellent for all of the above, as it prevents the formation of rust or galvanic corrosion between steel plugs / aluminum heads, stainless bolts / steel body parts, and the wheel hub / steel wheel (rust is a problem here).Please note that this is not a good product to use where continuous heavy vibration is present. Some variant of threadlocker is better suited to that application.I use this stuff on a daily basis, and it has saved me many fasteners that would have otherwise seized and broken off. I highly recommend it."
4,A little long and detailed,"I really enjoyed her relationship with Eleanor Roosevelt, that was surprising. Her marriage to Ernest Hemingway was insightful on what an self righteous self centered full of himself narcissist he was. Her drive for independence was inspiring but kind of boring and long. Book was okay."
5,Fun Birthday Calendar,"This is exactly how I thought it would be. I loe all of the pictures and words, and there is enough room on each date to write multiple birthdays."
3,Pleased But Disappointed,"Pleased to finally have a cute log but;Please check measurements before purchasing it's smallI didn't check the measurements it's 5 x 7and more importantly;August is missing the 1st thru the 16th& October has an extra page of the 17th thru the 30thSadly I've wrote in it so I can't return it, but for [...] and hard bound, guess I can't be too darn picky.."
2,Nice Mats But Mine Came With No Eyelets,I ordered these floor mats and waited 3 weeks for them only to dicover upon arrival that the two eyelets that were supposed to be inserted in the drivers mat were no present. Had the eyelets been present I would have given this item 5 stars as the mats are very well constucted. Now I have to return the mats and wait another 3 weeks for them to be delivered. That's bogus!!!!
