3,"Bombastic, half nonsense, half bitter truth - I liked it!","Grab a six-pack, start reading, and be prepared to cheer, boo, and be outraged. ""We live in fictitious times"", indeed - I think much of the book is bluster - I mean, you're been invited to an elementary school to read a book to some kids, and you've just been told that the US is under attack - who among us *wouldn't* get that GWB ""deer in the headlights"" look? No Michael Moore production is without a few cheap shots, but that's why I like 'em. Somebody has to stand up the ""dark side"", and Moore does it with more style and gusto than anybody in the whimpering, simpering ""Mainstream Media""."
1,"No truth here,","This book is a liberals screaming cry for help. Founded on the communist manifesto, the author is highly skilled in spreading lies. The book is really a waste of time if you're looking for the truth. A better book would be,"" The Real Lincoln"",or Webster's Dictionary."
1,Scary,"It is really horrifying to know that someone actually thinks this way - and even more so that people follow him. So much has been dispelled, and yet he (and many others) persist with the same arguments.I wonder why he never bothered writing a book about Clinton's questionable past, or any liberal candidates."
3,"Good ideas, sloppy journalism","Moore presents some great ideas, but he is just sloppy with the actual research. He makes blanket statements and over generalizations that reduce him to the level of Limbaugh, O'Reilly, Coulter, Savage, and all the other over generalizing liars.By steadily dropping his standards each book, he is doing a disservice to us all."
2,Disappointing,"I love much of Michael Moore's work, yet I found this to be disappointing. I was hoping for more incite into the Bush administration, more detail, more of everything. Michael Moore asks questions of George W. Bush and in my opinion already knows many of the answers (or at least intimates he knows). I found that the information provided did not satisfy my expectations and Michael Moore's humour came up a little short...I also believe that Moore covered many of the same topics in his previous book, which I loved...my recomendation is to buy Stupid White Men."
1,What does Michael believe in?,"I Listened on CD and while Mr. Moore does ask some Thought provoking questions he fails to pull the reader in as he trashes everyone as stupid. He mixes polls and survey results to answer his questions the way he wants them to sound (percentage, and 1-in 10000000 chances) He plays on the short memory of people and distorts dates to serve his own intrests. Other than hating George Bush I have no idea what he does believe in. It certianly isnt god, Stock market, capitalism, Democracy, or the working man (he's a millionair)."
4,exalted 2 is good like exalted 1,"you might be apprehensive about switching over from 1st edition, but if the hollidays are coming get your friends to buy you the 2nd edition core. they've cleaned up a lot of problems, both in the setting and the mechanics, granted they've added a handful of new problems, but that was to be expected."
4,Exalted a different type of RPG,"I haven't personally played too many White Wolf games but I have played 3rd Edition D&D a lot so I liked the fact in this game that I started out beefy instead of a character who could easily be killed off. I think the style is also very different from D&D in that its pulling more from Eastern style medieval period instead of the European one typical in D&D. Most impressive to me was how they did mass combat rules an item that doesn't typically occur much in other RPGs. My issues with this book is that it can be hard to find particular rules at times and some rules aren't entirely fleshed out enough that we've spent about 30 minutes debating on how a rule should work. The other issue is that this book gives you the entire background to the world which players themselves shouldn't always have because this book tries to be a combination of a GM and Players handbook. Overall, its has been a very enjoyable game to me and I would recommend any D&D player give it a chance."
1,Boring,Author had NOTHING to say. Nobody's life could be THAT boring. Come on. Author seems bitter and jealous of attractive women.I want my money back.
3,"Special Effect Are All This Movie Has, But They Are Worth It!!!!!","There is not point in droning on about this movie. The only thing that really needs to be said is that the movie contains some of the best special effects you could ever hope to see in a single movie. So many, in fact, that you will not catch much of the story line. You will be caught by the pretty pictures, and will not have time to really think that the movie line is crazy and very, very stupid. Overall worth a view from redbox, but not really worth buying, unless it is at a pawnshop for a few bucks."
3,Redeemed by the actors and special effects,"I love a good sci-fi movie. Throw in an apocalypse and I'm happy. However, I really do like to have some science fact and realism mixed in there, at least from time to time. Now don't get me wrong, the special effects were spectacular but when the coast of California fell off into the ocean, there should have been some gigantic tsunami racing across the pacific toward the asian coast, but oddly the tsunami didn't start until later in the movie. A little bit of a surprise at the end when the solution to save humanity turned out to be one thing when everyone was led to believe something else. I liked that."
1,"Bad, bad movie","I don`t understand how could John Cusack, Amanda Peet and Woody Harrelson lend themselves to make such a bad movie."
1,The worst movie I've ever seen,"With the top-notch actors and previews with awesome special effects, I expected an exciting film. Wrong! This movie fell flat. What's worse is that it's long. If not for the outstanding special effects and Woody Harrelson's role, the film is a total zero. Terrible writing, plot development and execution. Basically, a terrible movie."
2,missing info,"You should really tell people that this is NOT a standard blue ray dish..and its must have a RB-rom unit or It will NOT play,,,this really should be told..."
1,Gives me a headache.,"It fluxuates. It is either an irritating adventure,or overly dramatic/ upsetting movie. This is what the movies about for over 2 hours. Some how, only in holywood, this man and his family make it while billions of people are dying all around them. They always get away as the earth caves-in, blows up, or catches fire, ect. How many one line jokes, and quick get aways can you have in a movie? Well, that's all this c-ap is full of. Then the story changes to a highly emotional scene of father son making their peace, or man sacrafices his life for another person. If the director would have just stayed with the realistic, or the absord. However, he doesn't. So you'll either get a headach from the stupid one liners, or the overly dramatic heart tugging moments."
4,Good Movie,"I know its an event movie but thats whats good about it, its not suppose to make you think or stimulate your mind or anything. Its just a good, fun movie to sit and watch. Entertainment value only and good visuals."
1,Two hours of my life that I'll never get back,"I went to this movie with three friends and, on our way through the exit, we asked one another whether any of us could think of a worse movie that we'd seen. We all drew blanks. If special effects made a movie great, this one would be a chart-topper. But it takes more than that, and I just couldn't even begin to get around the two glaring flaws of this movie: [1] The pure cheesiness of the plot which mines every cliche that Hollywood has ever had; and [2] the completely incredible (literally) ability of the protagonists to survive disaster over and over again. To sum up, this is a movie with awe-inspiring visuals, but with a plot worthy of poor animation."
3,Not bad.,"Watched this the day after the world was supposed to end as a ""ha-ha, we're still here"" type of thing. A good apocalyptic movie if you ever need a good spooking."
3,Just okay,It was an okay movie with decent acting. The premise just got more and more unbelievable as it went along. Probably worth a watch though for $2.99.
3,Where is the spanish?,"I love this movie, but i didnt understand why this doesn't has spanish subtitles...... That was a problem for my friends that likes to see movies in our language"
1,Horrible 1985 made for TV movie,"all I kept thinking about while watching this, was the scene from ""escape from LA"" The horrible scene where Kurt russel was surfing on a title wave, it cant get worse, right?? Now, take that surfing scene and spread it out to 2 hours and thats basically 2012. The whole movie was rediculous. I cant believe people fall for this crap!!"
1,If this one is not...,"the worst screenplay ever to end up in the black, then what is? Please comment! The script break every principle (let's not get that one wrong)every ***** screenplay guru whose books are selling on this site recommends. Absolutely lousy acting, and an unbelievably pretentious storyline to begin with. And I loved Independence Day. 2012 is JUNK. The only apocalypse is that of the criteria of the film viewing audience (or perhaps???). Enlighten me, o dogwalkers!!! Don't forget those little plastic do-hingees. You mavens of cinematic art!"
2,VERY BAD,"I thought the movie was poorly done. Bad acting,Bad special effects.Seemed like it was thrown together to me for a quick buck."
3,"Cheesy plot, great special effects!","This is a fun movie by the same producers that brought you ""Independence Day"", so you know what you are getting into: cheesy plot, predictable characters, very conservative black-and-white morality... but you will have a good time with it. It is also one of the few movies that I would recommend to watch strictly on Blu-ray, since the detailed disaster special effects can only be seen on HD, and they are worth a look."
2,Another awful Roland Emerich film,"Another awful Roland Emerich film with fun special effects (thus making tons of money).As usual, there are lots of stereotypical characters doing stereotypical things against a backdrop of things falling spectacularly apart. Emerich wisely hires very good, engaging actors to embody his cardboard characters so the weaknesses are not nearly as glaring as they wold otherwise be. And really, you can't do better than John Cusack as a sympathetic leading man.Based on the trailers shown before the film when I saw it, the marketing folks know without a doubt that this movie is going to bring in the lowest-common-denominator suckers to pitch their other by-the-numbers comedy and action films to."
1,Misrepresented Product,"Given the way the product is presented, any consumer would assume that one or both discs would play on a standard Blueray player, but this was not the case. Neither disc will play on a standard Blueray player, and I do not have an X-Box, nor does my desktop PC have a Blueray player. I spent two hours trying to find a way to communicate with Amazon.com customer support, but after two hours, I now realize that Amazon.com customer support access (to take care of my issues with this product) does not exist. I have come to realize that Amazon.com has become a blind electronic fleamarket, where buyer beware."
3,Bad casting,"Well I must say that the special effects were the reason I bought this DVD. AND the Blu Ray is really nice but some of the choices for actors in this movie kept the picture from being as good as it could have been. Danny Glover, soft spoken, easy going Danny Glover for US President, come on now. Not in a million years. This is just one example. The plot is a bit week to begin with and then you throw in the bad casting and you have a so so picture saved by the special effects department. Oh well."
2,Lousy movie.,"Watched this movie (Netflix rental) in U.S. 03MAR10. Actors don't/can't act (except the dog). Movie's premise is ridiculous. Special effects are weak (e.g., USS John F Kennedy washing onto the White House - doh!). Movie's situations are contrived and disjointed and too many. All-in-all, a lousy film. The video and DTS HD-MA audio are great."
1,Did somebody lose a bet?,"At first I thought this was a practical joke but alas it was not April Fool's Day. Then - I seriously considered that some investors lost a bet and as the loser had to fund this movie. I am not quite sure about that either. What I do know is that this is possibly the WORST MOVIE IN MANKIND! Honest to God, it was THAT BAD. I almost feel bad for the director - but he/she knew what they were getting into. And the classic ending that leaves us with a soft rock ballad PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND - after 99.9% OF MANKIND IS DESTROYED!!!!! I AM NOT MAKING THIS UP! Do yourself a favor and spend your time on something other than this movie."
1,worst movie ever,"save your money and the two hours of your life. this thing is pure trash. better dialogue on bathroom walls. ridiculous plot. superhuman vehicles that can outrun every form of fire and explosion. lame love story. seriously, one of the worst things I've ever sat thru."
1,da bomb,"Cliche characters, predictable plot, pretentious sentimentality, ridiculously garish effects. Mindless drool-inducing brain-numbing hollywood potboiler.Noah's ark theme will appeal to the bible-thumpers.Please don't encourage them any further by paying money for this trash."
1,Bad Cinema,"Terrible, terrible. Couldn't be worse, couldn't be worse.That being said, considering the length of the movie, it should receive negative stars! What was John Cusack thinking to appear in a turkey like this?"
1,Do not waist your time and money!,"Could have been a great movie. Special effects were great, the whole idea was good, but turning Cusak into the next Rambo was ridiculous. The story line was terrible!!!!! At least I did not spend money going to the movies for this one!!"
1,Hang the screenwriter!,"I like John Cusack, he is a brilliant actor, sadly he is often in some minor movies usualy and still I hope he will play in much more serious good movies. Beside that, I wonder who is that brainless amoeba that wrote such a screenplay and get paid (!) and found a group of other brainless people that put their own money to produce such a nonsense????????????? Such theme could be made in much serious way, instead here is one noisy show with 3d effect just to remind to ordinary people that such serious issue (believing in issues like 2012 or not, bibblical flood or not, da vinci code main issue etc.....) are just something that you do not have to worry about. The goverment will take care of you and show to you the best for you: living in a complete ignorance! They Live, We Sleep!"
1,Waste of 2+ hours....,Dumb..Dumb..Dumb....Its gets one star for the cool yellowstone eruption..Last 30-45 minutes of the movie were one of the most ridiculous I have ever seen. You have been warned...
1,Really?,"My God, this movie makes 1951's ""When Worlds Collide"" look like ""Citizen Kane"". 2012 is sad indictment of Hollywood. It is a ridiculous movie with a cliché a minute. The scene where Calfornia is falling into the sea for instance, is a non-stop montage of narrow cliff-hanging escape among rivers of lava, buckling pavement and exploding skyscrapers all set to a John Williamesque sweeping musical score that is almost laughable. John Cusack's character achieves these feats of rapid fire skin of your teeth escapes while driving a limousine which among other passengers included his two children. Placing children in danger to cheaply raise the viewers feeling of angst is one of the lowest forms of Hollywood moving making. The CGI effects are passable but often very video game-like. Watch this movie only if you have 2 1/2 hours to completely throw away."
2,Dumb dumb dumb,"Even if you view this as a ""popcorn"" type movie, 2012 is terrible. By the third time I saw John Cusack narrowly escape doom by inches while the ground beneath him is literally crumbling, I was thinking ""here we go again."" All the CG was so over the top it eventually becomes a parody of itself, and it got *so* repetitive that it became a bit boring. Most filmmakers know that 100 explosions are not necessarily 10 times better than 10 explosions, a lesson lost of 2012.Then of course add in the stereotyped characters, nonsensical plot, and a pretty good cast wasted. The plot holes are stupendous. At the end I felt like I had lost two hours of my life. But I did finish the movie, and I think that Cusack and Oliver Pratt did the best they could with the material provided, so for that I give the movie two stars."
1,why this movie sucks,after you cut out all the fx in this movie you do have a good movie you have a load of crap john cusack look at the way he talks to the kids not good as a father you would think he just met the kids
3,"2012... sigh, another disaster movie, out on Stars by the time I got it","Well, like the title suggests... it was good, but left a bit to be desired. The plot was pretty guessable to use a fake word. You knew what was coming... you knew pretty much that Cusack and family would make it, and made you wonder when the crust was breaking up, why fly?? Where you gonna land? Then the giant ""arks"" for the mega rich... wow... who would've guessed the rich carry on? Sorry, seen one, seen 'em all. But have it now, add it to the rest of the collection."
4,Good disaster flick,"If you like disaster movies like me, you might like this one. It's not that realistic, but still pretty good."
2,Disaster(ous) Movie,"There were so many characters in this movie that the whole thing felt cluttered and tedious. It might have been a very good movie if they had toned everything down a bit and made it more believable. Plus I thought their alternate ending was more interesting than the one they chose. This is a movie that I would suggest renting if you want to see it that badly rather than buying it to add to your movie library. I much preferred ""Day After Tomorrow"" as a disaster flick than this one."
2,BOOM! CRASH! AAAIEEE!! RUN! DUCK! HELP!,"Yes, 2012 has some great explosions. Stuff does blow up real good. Big explosions!The plot? Well, it is about the sun heating the Earth with nutrinos causing massive earthquakes, or something, and the government's efforts to survive the disaster.Not enough plot for you? Well, add in John Cusack as a washed up writer/limo driver, who finds out about the government's plans and wades through the devestation with his ex-wife and daughter to a possible safe area on a special map.I was supposed to believe that the world's governments would cooperate like they did in this movie. There was alot of unbelievable stuff in this movie, but that can be overlooked if there was more to this movie than just some big explosions."
5,Amazing,"I was waiting for a movie that excited me from beginning to end, and finally 2012 was that movie.From the beginning i was on the edge of my seat. Great job the all those who had a handle in making the this movie."
3,Another big action movie with lack of plot,"But truly the visuals make up for it in this movie. And the cast is great, they do their best with what they have to work with. The plot could have been better but the visuals and effects are worth seeing this for!"
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"This movie should only have gotten one star, but I love John Cusack. I also typically love big-budget, great special effects blockbusters. But, while the all-star cast was doing its best to deliver lame lines, it was just a boring movie with an entirely forgettable plot. What little character development there was felt rushed and surficial so when supporting characters started dying off, you did not feel any sense of great loss like you might in a better film. This is approximately 2 1/2 hours of your life that would be better spent doing pretty much anything else. I'm sorry I paid for the blu-ray two-disc special edition, but would have been even more ticked off if I had wasted time going to the theater. Save your money and buy something else."
3,The sad life of Russian villages,"Perhaps you have to be a Russian literature junkie like me to enjoy this book, but I think it is good literature, although not a masterpiece. It tells the story of the brothers Kuzma and Tikhon Ilich, who live in the village of Durnovka. It is a small and isolated village, where life is dull, sad and hard. Everyday is a struggle for survival in a hostile environment. As always in Russian literature, the characters are tormented people (is it the cold and the vastness, or what?), with tortured souls and a great difficulty to get along with their neighbors. Kuzma goes to Tikhon's farm, to manage it, but at some point he leaves. The best about it is Bunin's sensitiveness and beautiful wording."
5,incredible savings,"I bought this unit on line because the local auto parts stores wanted $80 bucks for it AND had to back order it. It's not every day I save $50 bucks. With the economy being what it is, we have to find ways SAVE!Yes I would recommend."
5,LONDON AND RYSANEK FOREVER!,ZIZZLING PERFORMANCE--THIS IS WHAT LIVE RECORDINGS ARE ALL ABOUT. I DO NOT HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO COMMENT ON MISSED BEATS OR CRACKED NOTES. ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT THE PERFORMANCE CARESSES YOUR EAR AND GIVES YOU A HIGH. WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT? ANY RYSANEK RECORDING IS A MUST!!!
3,Ann got in a hurry,"I love Ann Rule's true stories and highly admire her talent as one of the truly great authors. So when I spotted HEART FULL OF LIES on the shelf, I didn't hesitate to buy it. I wasted no time in getting started with my reading, but I have to admit that I was really sort of disappointed with this story. There seemed to be a lack of continuity with Ann's prose, and I began to get confused about the characters. Then I thought, oh well, what to heck, just keep reading and see what happens. After reading EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE, maybe I expected too much. When I'd finished reading the book, I simply had to think that Ann was in a hurry when she wrote this piece of non-fiction. I haven't given up on Ann though, I'll still be patiently waiting for her next published novel."
2,Disappointing,"I've read almost all of Ann Rule's books, but this book is not up to her usual standards. There's not the usual excitement to the story (this crime is hardly worth a book) and the book is heavily padded with repetitive material. Almost every other sentence is about what a wonderful mother she was, how she lied about her husband abusing her...enough. Instead of ""not being able to put it down"", I couldn't wait until it was over."
1,Don't buy this book -- bad bad writing,"Oh, my. The story might have been a good one, but the writing is awful. How awful? .Paragraphs don't hang together, chapters don't hang together. It's repetitive. ""For all intents and purposes..."" used at least three times. Ms. Rule's writing is stilted and has no flow. Moreover, the story wasn't developed in a suspenseful manner, though it could have been.I never read Ann Rule before and I won't again. Can't believe she's a best-selling writer. It was a waste of my money."
2,Not One of Ann Rule's Best Books,I have been reading Anne Rule's TC books ever since her first many years ago. I have to say the last two books I have read (especially this one)have been very disappointing.She repeats herself through out the book which gets really annoying. Especially from such a noted author. I also wonder why editing didn't pick up on that and fix it?For sure this is a very biased book. Ann Rule's animosity for Lysa seeps through every page. I find it hard to believe such polar opposites are true. That Chris was all good and Lysa was all bad. That just isn't real life.This book just seems like a quickly written formula book with no real substance. I expect more from Ann Rule. I expect interviews from all sides and not a one sided book.I do think that Lysa has huge issues but I also think Chris was a documented abuser and alcoholic. I have lived around too many high functioning alcoholics and have seen first hand how easily they can fool people.
3,Like 'True Detective',"Because the author was unable to speak to either of the principals in this story, it sometimes reads like a ""True Detective"" mag; everything second- or third-hand. You can kinda tell that Ann was uncomfortable speaking with the relatives of both ""Chris"" and ""Liysa"". Her constant assertations that Liysa was such an ""incredible,"" ""loving,"" ""perfect,"" mother certainly wars with Liysa's personality as revealed in the book and is really sickening after a while. How could Liysa be the queen of every group she belonged to while everyone in Chris' world detested her? Life just doesn't work that way. Ann needs to get real."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this book because I was familiar with the author's previous work. This book is far below par, and is downright boring. I was very disappointed."
2,I wanted to put it down too many times...,"I'm sorry, but this was just not a good book, in my opinion. I love true crime and love many of Ann Rule's books, but this one seemed repetitious throughout the whole book. It was very one-sided and I don't think it accurately reflected the facts, or really, any facts at all. I would've stopped reading, but I've been very bored and did not have anything else to do. On Ann Rule's website, she talks about never wanting to ""fluff"" her material up... but I think that is all this book consisted of... a lot of fluff."
4,Loved the somewhat different approach on this one,"I have read almost all of Ann Rule's books and, by her own admission, this one was a bit different. The other books I have read from Ms. Rule are more cut and dried in terms of the clear line between innocent victim and evil perpetrator. In this case, there was much more of a ""balanced"" approach in weighing both sides. As usual, I was completely hooked from start to finish. You will find yourself shaking your head in disbelief at the lengths the subject of this book will go to in order to manipulate the people around her. Amazing story from a master true crime writer."
4,Too Short,"These stories were fun to read and very orgininal(peacocks!), but they were to short to have all the plot twists and suprises I really love about her other books. They were nice but I prefer her long stories better."
5,Hope At Last for Migrant Workers,"Immigrants, Unions, and the New US Labor Market is the most timely and intelligent examination of the implicatoins of the expansion of global capitalism on international migration. The book provides real life evidence of the human spirit of solidarity among migrant workers. This stirring book offers a roadmap for unions and employers of the eternal struggle for dignity among an outcast population that now forms an important component of American labor. This penetrating book is indispensable to understand the plight of migrants and how social conditions and human experience shapes the actions of working people. I commend the author."
1,Fluorescent Flicker,"***NOTICE***I just now wired it up only to be disappointed. Googling the issue led me here, so I'll share my experience.The product specifically states that it is compatible with rapid start fluorescent lamps; however, when in auto mode, the fluorescent lights will only flicker. The fluorescent lights will stay on when placed in ""on"" mode, but that defeats the purpose of the product. The best suited locations for this device are in laundry rooms and/or garages. Generally you're using compact fluorescent or rapid start fluorescent lighting in those areas.The packaging clearly misleads the consumer during purchase; therefore, this product is garbage.***STAY AWAY***"
1,"Very attractive bowl, but...","This bowl is so pretty and I love Corelle products. But I was very surprised when I used it the first time, lightly bumped the bottom against my counter, and a piece chipped off. My other Corelle products are so strong that I didn't expect it. I intended to purchase the beautiful matching platter, but decided against it. Just handle with care if you buy this lovely bowl."
1,L7780 - Not Really Wireless - Will Not Scan,"Ok, so this thing does print and copy well at a reasonable speed. BUT, it is not wireless, it has never been wireless, in fact it will not even show up via an ethernet connection so I print through a USB. It will not scan properly if at all and I cannot make adjustments through the software. This would-be-all-in-one is like a two year old child; it is loud, tempermental, gives you lots of crap and does only half of what it's told. It does not belong in an office. Click off it, walk past it, don't even think about it."
2,Good luck- you're going to need it,"I purchased this for use in my office. When it is working it sounds like the paper is being attacked. But the printing quality is fine. But every time I disconnect my laptop for travel use, I have to reinstall the software. I have 3 other older HP printers, I have sworn by them to others. This printer is nothing but a headache. I'm getting tired of installing this software and this is my second replacement. And yes the duplex system leaves a lot to be desired. Don't buy this unless you have very low quantity needs. There are cheaper printers that offer more."
1,Installing and using the HP L7780 is a real time sink,My 1st job out of calloges was with HP and I loved the company back then in the 70's and early 80's. Quality was a must. The HP Officjet Pro L7780 ought not to have been released. The installation was a nightmare and had to be completed many times. Once that was accomplished after many hours of frustration the paper has been jamming repeatedly. After a few months of this I am ready to throw the thing out.Don't buy one of these nightmares unless you are ready to waste a great deal of time with hassles every step of the way.
3,Tray default and lock don't work as expected,"I purchased the 7780 rather than the less expensive 7680 to take advantage of the 2nd, and larger, paper tray. The first tray holds 250 sheets, the second 350 sheets. My plan was to load the smaller, tray 1 with envelopes, letter head or photo paper, and the larger 2nd tray with ordinary paper. You can set either tray as the ""default"" tray or ""lock"" a tray to restrict printing to that locked tray. The idea is to prevent selecting a tray with letter head stationary when the stock paper tray runs out. The problem is that it doesn't work that way.With tray 1 locked and the optional 2nd tray set as ""default"", printing from the computer works fine, tray 2 is the source of paper. The problem occurs upon receipt of a fax or when copying a document from the device, it always prints to tray 1, which is ""locked"".HP support says that is the way it works. Sounds like a design error to me.Otherwise, it's a terrific printer"
1,HP missed the mark on this one.,"I own several of HP's printers for my home and office and this is the only product I would not rate highly. This product was a real DUD! I am almost to embarassed to admit this is my second HP multifunction machines. BOTH were from the same family and both auto document feeders malfunctioned after about 6 months. Jams, failure to feed properly, faxing 2 of 3 pages is the norm. It is a shame because I would rate all the other aspects of the printer very highly. It prints, receives faxes, and copies very well. BUT, if you advertise it as MULTIFUNCTION unit, it must perform multifunction. Not banging on HP, but they missed the mark here."
1,Avoid This Disaster,"I bought this machine two years ago and have had nothing but problems with it.Had problems getting it to go into power save mode - it randomly stays on with the scan light burning for no reasonDevice would always ask for a digital certificate - HP then camp up with this crazy 12+ step fix that didn't work, then basically said there was no other help they could suggest. In essence, they gave up.Both the scan and copy functions produce color streaks down the printed documentsAfter a year, the network card crapped outAfter the second year, the wireless crapped outNow I have to use the USB connection and all I have left that works is basic printing and faxingThis is a machine that gets very light and sporadic use. What a disappointment in product quality and manufacturer support."
2,troubles,"I don't think this product is ready for prime time.The Cd that was enclosed was not ready for a new Mac; find the righting the correct one was a pain.It contains NO manual, requiring you to find and then down load the trouble shooting section.First thing I did was a copy; and it had a paper jam.The manual was awful, the drawings confusing. (I am an engineer; it should not have been any where this difficult.) On the web I found some photo's.The photos were small and could not be enlarged.I called the help desk... the guy was nice and he tried.But, he did not have access to better quality pictures; and the machine that they had on site was missing parts!!I finally figured it out while I was on hold for (the call lasted nearly an hour).john"
1,Worst All in One I have ever owned,"Horrible feeder jams, no real scan into memory - the combination of the two means you have to stand over the printer to make sure you fax goes through which takes FOREVER.I have owned 10 plus all in one - and this one is the worst."
2,bugs.,"Bug after bug and error after error. Sigh. The basic printing is good, but the feeder, paper jams, and driver bugs make me concur with all the other low reviews. Also, for years it was programmed to stop working unless I put more color ink in it even though I was printing with the software set to black and white. That's right..every now and then, it decided I had to put new color ink (three colors; they take turns) or I couldn't use my black ink to print in black and white. I think there was a class action lawsuit and then the problem seemed to go away one day (maybe as part of the litigation?). Classy, HP."
2,Printer Glitch?,"I don't know if this is common for this kind of printer considering the 3 star overall rating for it, but every time I try to print something, when the paper comes out, it has lines running through the text/ picture. It has done this since day one and we don't know how to fix it. Otherwise it works fine but the lines running through the pictures is a presentation ruiner, as it looks terrible."
1,screwed,"HP Officejet Pro L7780 Color All-in-One Printer/Fax/Scanner/Copier (C8192A#ABA)Well, finally burned by hp. never thought it would happen. tech guy told me to trash and upgrade from this machine after I had it a little over a year and 200 prints and copies ( heavy use huh) Ink leaks from the manifold all over hte place. I have redownloaded and reinstalled the driver for this machine at least a half a dozen times. Wow where do I go from here"
3,Duplexing not the best...,"One of the reasons I chose this model over others is for duplexing. As it turns out, this is not the printers strong point. I've had about 10% of the duplexing jobs jam, which is unexceptable. So, now I don't use the printer the way I intended, and limit my duplexing requests to 1-page jobs that are easy to ""redo"". All the other functions are easy to use and work fine."
2,Not up to HP expectations,"The Officejet Pro L7780 offers a lot of features for a great price, but that is where the value ends. I freqently have had issues with missing print and crooked pages through the sheet feeder. It has also jambed a number of times in the month that I have had it. The driver has issues that HP and Microsoft are both aware of that cause Office 2007 applications to close unexpectedly. While I thought this combination of features in a low cost-per-page printer would be a dream come true, it has turned out to be my worst printer to date."
1,WARNING PIECE OF JUNK!!! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I purchase alot of printers and pcs for our small business and this by far takes the cake. To begin with the fax has stopped working all together. Secondly after less than a year the printhead had to be completely replaced after spending an hour doing all the suggested trouble shooting ideas. So HP does send a new one after repeating my information to someone I could barely understand at least 20 minutes. This takes about a week to get the part in. I replace it and the printer seems to work fine for about two months and now it is broken again. ARG! We do not do alot of printing, in fact we only use it for color but still somehow it keeps breaking. Useless, dont bother. I would recommend a Brother printer instead. We bought it at the same time for half the price and it is still going strong w/zero probs."
1,Duplex Jam kills feature,"I bought the HP Officejet Pro L7780 with high hopes for all of its advertised features. So many good reviews, but I too am having problems with the duplex unit causing paper jams intermittently. What good is a tool if you constantly have to mess with it. I am going to return it tomorrow. Why would HP, a company known for quality, sell out on the one thing that set them apart? Bah Humbug.Keith"
1,Quality issues - lousy support,"I'm on my second printer now. The first refused to print duplex (paper jam all the time). The 2nd printer has problems printing duplex after 20 pages or so. I've already spent hours with HP support on this - HP HAS THE WORST SUPPORT - let me repeat that one more time: HP HAS THE WORST SUPPORT. If you get a printer that works flawlessly, consider yourself lucky. If not, then be prepared to spend HOURS on the phone and very frustrating waiting periods. As far as I'm concerned, there are no quality checks and I personally spent a lot more time on this than what the printer is actually worth. I would have paid double the money if I didn't have to deal with HP's support. I long for quality not quantity - if any printer manufacturer out there reads this, please, whatever happened with printers that just worked?"
1,Do Not Recommend,I returned it. Nothing but problems with software and networking. Wireless worked but not wired. HP sent replacement and still didn't work. Wasted a lot of time on the telephone with HP Customer Service before finally giving up.
3,Interesting but skimpy,"Just a quick overview and a few riders' stories about the Tevis, rather dated since it was written 20+ years ago... only 86 pages, about half of which were Sam Savitt's great drawings. I read it in the parking lot of the library I requested it through! I would sure love to read more detailed ride stories. A nice collectible to add to an endurance rider's bookshelf, if you could find it at a reasonable price."
3,...like a backed up sneeze,"I have been a huge fan of Jane Feather ever since I first picked up ""Vice"". After reading that book, I grabbed up all of her other ""V"" books and anything else with her name on it. I read the first two books in the trilogy and could not wait until ""Least Likely"" was published. First imagine my surprise when it was released in hardback (a first for Feather) and then imagine my disappointment in the story itself. I had more sympathy for Olivia in the first two novels than I did in this one. The ending left much to be desired and the book on the whole does not live up Feather's previous work. I guess I had a different idea as to how Olivia's story would unfold as opposed to Feather. For a person who is unfamiliar with Feather's work, then this book would probably appeal to them; but as a fan of hers for over 5 years, I've read better novels of hers."
5,"Really, really, good!!!","This book is really good. I have read other books by Jane Feather but I did not really like them. ""The Least Likely Bride"" is a really good story and it's worth reading. It's a real page turner...I know, I know, I used ""really"" too many times but oh well. Have fun readin'."
3,Sad and Disappointed,"Jane! Jane!Jane! What were you thinking? I loved your first two books of the bride trilogy but was very disappointed in The Least Likely Bride! It was almost as if the wind was taken out of your sails in the end. You took a very sensitive subject and did a great job conveying how it totally effected Olivia's life, and relationships. However, I felt that Olivia never overcame this tragic event in her life, and settled instead of grabbing for the brass ring!Please make a part II !"
1,Not Readable,"While I am extremely grateful to the author for his service, this book was almost unreadable. It is a compilation of disjointed paragraphs of people's recollections. There really is no cohesive story. Each chapter is similar, with only time and place changing in the text. My second book by this author. I have purchased the third, but not sure I will try to read it. Regardless, it goes to the bottom of the pile."
4,Informative and entertaining,"I knew very little about the Holland campaign other than the events in Arnhem, this book really lays out the rest of the campaign in good detail. It's mainly a collection of firsthand accounts from both Dutch civilians, US Airborne and British troopers. If you're experience with WWII 101st Airborne is limited to the 506 PIR ""Easy"" Company (Band of Brothers), this book really shows what the entire division experienced.I really appreciated the civilian accounts. A humble and thankful people that risk their lives to assist troops again and again. There were heroes out of uniform as well.I would have given it 5 out of 5 stars had it not been for two things. The maps are not to professional (scale would be nice) and the nature of the chapters is somewhat confusing at times. It's not always in chronological sequence, but rather divisional or locational order. I, personally, would have prefered a complete chronological account."
4,"Fascinating, first hand accounts.","Like many people who saw ""Saving Private Ryan"" I was interested in finding out more about what happened in WWII. I was born in 1959 and I've seen all of the old war movies. This book brought it all down to a very human level. The men in the trenches tell their own stories and Mr. Koskimaki puts these stories together so that you get a much clearer picture of the day to day actions and heroism that these brave men (and women) survived. I recommend it highly"
1,WORSE PASTOR JONES EVER,"I have seen many Pastor Jones series movies, but this was the worse. Sorry I wasted my money on it. Bad acting, audio, bad script. I will not purchase any more Pastor Jones movies. Lemarr is not consistent in his moving making. Some good, some bad. I've seen all I want to see from him.He also chose bad actors/actresses. They have no skills, no ability to act. Looks like he just uses anybody. Just pull them off the street, LOL. chuckle, chuckle.He needs to improve his writing, directing & producing skills before he put out anymore movies."
3,NICE FIRST EFFORT,"THIS WAS DEFINITELY A VERY GOOD FIRST EFFORT, AND I DID ENJOY THE BOOK. THIS THE THIRD BOOK BY THIS AUTHOR THAT I HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF READING. TO ANYONE WHO READS THIS REVIEW, I STRONGLY SUGGEST READING ""BEHIND"" FIRST AND THEN GOING ON TO THE OTHERS. HER SOPHOMORE THEN JUNIOR EFFORTS WERE A LOT BETTER THAN THE FIRST. THIS ONE GOT A LITTLE LONG WINDED AND TIMES WHEN IT CAME TO DESCRIBING THE CARS, JEWELS, CLOTHING, HOUSE, ETC. NOT WITHSTANDING ALL OF THIS, IT WAS ENTERTAINING, I READ IT IN 3 HOURS."
3,The American Dream,"For Regina and Karen they seem to have the world at their fingertips. Outstanding careers, beautiful homes and successful husbands appear to give both these women all the satisfaction they desire. They have been best friends for as long as they can remember.Abruptly, these women will experience their fair share of marital infidelity, gambling, lust, and lies. Their Ivy League educations could not have prepared them for the greatest test of all...life.This is an interesting read. I read some of Roby's later novels first so I can see how her writing has improved. Her writing has evolved and her use of imagery is more perplexed. Very entertaining!"
2,oh my wordy!,"though this book gives a glimpse of the overall pace and stress of a bike messenger's work, it is incredibly overwritten. too much sloppy, masturbatory prose. worth a skim if youre intersted in the bike courier lifestyle, but take it with a few grains of salt. it is clear, after a few chapters, that this cat didnt actually live the life himself."
1,not very useful,"This book attempts to do the impossible by guiding non-technical people through the process of building an NT intranet. It starts with ""what is a network"" and transitions quickly to installing IP and installing IIS. The book lacks any technical depth and I found it mostly useless. Windows NT Server 4 Unleashed worked better for me."
4,"Some of it, I felt was not neccesary . . .","Pavel added really great workouts for that is gets a 4 star rating . . . but i would have given it a 5 stars rating if it did not includes a bunch of things I did not really care about. I found it bothersome. It was my impression that Pavel tries to sell you on the whole kettlebell workout thing. While reading I kept thinking to myself wow there is a bunch of things here I don't care about, like history of the kettlebell workout and how it can help my skinny body get huge. Now I realize you can skip all this because it is a book . . . that is a welcome feature in a books. Hope this helps you make a decision!"
5,Magical kettlebells!,"Russian Kettlebells are especially well suited for PHA training since it is so easy to move from one Russian Kettlebell exercise to the next without setting the weight down. The continuous motion will sufficiently tax the cardiovascular system to build endurance while the lifting of weights simultaneously stresses the muscles. You are going to expend a tremendous amount of energy, and that translates into tremendous conditioning and fat loss. If you cut back on your calories a bit you¿ll be amazed at how quickly you shift your fat!This book is an excellent resource![...]"
3,Breif introduction to Wagner's music,"If you want a short but complete introduction to Wagner's Ring , this book is a good choice. There's also a list of recordings recommended by the author ( which includes the ""must have"" versions of the Ring available today ) ."
2,Not Worth the Money...,"I was excited about purchasing this play coffee pot. My son only likes to play with things that are 'real' looking, so I knew if I got a brightly colored, unrealistic looking coffee pot, he wouldn't be interested. Although it is quite realistic looking, I was surprised at how small and 'cheap' the toy looked for the price. The 'realistic' sound is disappointing and doesn't last long. You can pour water into the basket and watch it run through into the pot, but there's no on/off to control it. So, if your child uses the pot to fill the water into the reservoir, just like mommy does, the water will come pouring out immediately all over. It's cute and my son was amused briefly, but for the 20+ dollars with the shipping that it cost...REALLY not worth it. I'm still mad that I bought it..."
1,Unacceptable,"Wow. Sony must be losing it. This bundle shows contempt for both the audience, as well as the films themselves."
5,Hormel Chunk White Turkey,"These cans of Turkey are great for turkey salad sandwiches, or add them to a salad or casserole, or a soup. Very nice chunks, packed full and great taste. Good to have around to snack on and not have to be so concerned about putting on extra weight. Tasty and an easy fix for a hungry friend or neighbor who stops by---or for yourself."
4,Bah to superstition,"Despite Mary Anne's sweet and shy personality, she has gained rivals because girls are jealous that she has a boyfriend (Logan) You know what they say, haters gonna hate. So they decide to screw around with Mary Anne by making her believe that she has been cursed with bad luck. In the end it proves to just be a prank, and the club learns to not take superstition so seriously."
3,Cute clothes & accessories,I bought this doll at Wal-Mart for my doll collection. I already purchased the Hilary Duff dolls and was satisfied with them. But I actually like Haylie Duff doll better. It looks a lot like her and the clothes are trendy and the extra accessories are neat.
4,The ghosts come out to play while the plot thickens.,"An apparent clue in the controversial missing girl case that Ethan Proctor's Black Oak took on leads to England and a unique haunting. What Proctor began to suspect in 'Episode' 2: The Hush of Dark Wings is confirmed here. Dark forces of some kind have marked him, but for what? The story arc plot grows thicker, the red herrings swarm, and the whole things builds to a nifty sword fight between man and ghost. Black Oak 'Episode' 3: Winter Knight is yet another delightfully creepy tale that will leave you begging for the next series entry."
5,Great!,This is an excellent book if you are looking to get out of debt! Dave Ramsey is very motivating and helps you to take baby steps so you can get excited about your accomplishments. It's easy to read and comes with great examples.
4,This more about the author...,"...I love this man. Not a Christian myself but I admire Dave Ramsey for living out his principles. Inspired by his radio show ([...]), I paid off the remaining $12,000 of my student loan debt in 8 months...and now I'm debt free! Now on to baby step 3..."
5,"Kermit the Hermit, a very entertaining story.",The Muppet Babies is a series of books which include characters with large imaginations that can go to imaginary places. Very entertaining for children.
5,The History of The Moose,BEST HOCKEY TAPE EVER! Gives you the whole story on one of the NHL's greatest players. Really exciting!
1,Interesting title to this movie. . .,"Leader, Champion and Legend??? OK HE IS NONE OF THOSE THINGS. Anyone notice how bad his teams got whenever Wayne Gretzky wasn't his teammate any longer? He never knew when to stop. For a while, he was succeeding in passing off his own skill as just that, his own skill, but once Gretzky left him out there alone, it became very obvious who he really was, or, I should say, wasn't. People like me recognized how overrated he was even when he was with the Oilers. He thought he was old school, when he was just old."
3,So so...,"Perhaps if I had not read any of Nancy Bell's Biggie series, I would have liked this better, but it is inevitable that one would compare this with the charming Biggie books. Judge Crain just isn't very interesting--if I must tell the truth--and the town is not so much fun as Job's Crossing. The plot is only OK, but plot is not the most important or noticeable ingredient in a Nancy Bell book. I kept having the sense that I had seen all this before in Lilian Jackson Braun's cat books. I do hope the writer will end the Judge Crain series and return to Biggie's adventures."
4,Does what it should!,"I really needed to organize better in my new, smaller closet when I moved. This really helped - but it did need to be somewhat balanced or it was a little dangerous to yank things off of when in a hurry. I have heavy belts! :)"
3,3 star review,"The ""Disciple-Making Church"" by Bill Hull was somewhat of a disappointment. Though he made several good observations about the modern church, I felt the template he applied to the NT was forced, and overall I found his argument to be a little flat. On the one hand, he proves his case that all believers should be disciple makers, and the structure of the church should be decentralized. But I think he makes too much of the difference between the method of Jesus and the disciples. In addition to the ""First Church, Jerusalem Church, and Disciple-Making Church"" being a somewhat contrived pattern that he overlays on the text, he also gets the reader lost in diagrams and flow charts that appear circuitous and difficult to follow. My advice is to get the ""Simple Church"" by Thom Rainier. It's a far better researched and practical book."
5,A superb storyteller with a wealth of stories to tell.,"Reviewer: David Gardiner from London, United Kingdom. 01.10.03Written with a wonderful sense of irony and dry humour, acclaimed and emulated by fellow-writers for their technical perfection, these stories will reduce you successively to shocked silence and helpless laughter. Mr. Bruce can find humour in tragedy and a vein of sadness just below the surface of comedy. These could only have been written by someone who had lived a long life in the role of an outsider, and who understands the uneasy truce that defines the end point in the battle against alcoholism. A truly riveting and unforgettable journey through the soul of a superb storyteller with a wealth of stories to tell."
1,Yucketh,"This version is horrible. I was looking for one of those Shakespeare versions that footnoted the words and phrases you didn't understand, so you could piece together the meaning yourself. Instead, this version gives you very a very simplistic interpretation of the text, every step of the way. I wouldn't recommend this edition to anyone."
1,When in Maine...,"...Go to the restaurants. When not, don't think this book is really going to cut it. True, there are a handful of great recipes--those come from the chefs who contributed. Brooke's recipes are unnecessarily laden with fat in many cases and are kind of bland too. This book did not Re-create the authentic tastes that I miss from my days in Maine--very very disappointing."
5,LOVE this book!,"Good old Shel Silverstein! Great sense of humor, has silly poems and deep ones as well. Easy for children to read as well"
4,good product,the problem is that only have space for 1 message....so when you record a new message delete the older...
5,Delicious!,"I have to disagree with the above customer....as I loved these cookies. But then again, I don't like a real sweet cookie. These taste like a breakfast bread. Very nice!!!!!!!! The other flavors are good as well. The almond are my favorite."
5,Glaoch Álainn an Phíobaire,"This is a truly beautiful album. Liam O'Flynn's skills need no explanation. With very few exceptions, this album is entrancing from start to finish. Some highlights are The Gold Ring, and the utterly beautiful air An Bhean Dubh na Gleanna, with a gorgeous orchestral backing scored by Mícheál ?"" Súilleabháin (why can't the Irish tenors do something similar instead of that boring drawing-room schmaltz?). The strathspey selection is also beautiful. Perhaps the only shortcomings of the album are a rather boring original tune with guest Mark Knopfler, and a dearth of regulator work. One of Liam O'Flynn's strengths as a piper is his use of the regulators and aside from one or two touches, they are sorely lacking. All in all, however, this album is a must for any fan of Irish music and uillean piping in particular."
1,ClearAV Cancelled my order!,"ClearAV, cancelled my order. I do NOT recommend doing business with ClearAV.I would give ClearAV 0 stars if it were possible."
1,Incredibly poor quality,"This cord didn't fit properly into the digitial optical audio jacks in both my AV receiver and my television. As a result, there was a lot of static ""popping"" while trying to play music or watch television. I ended up throwing the cord out rather than deal with the hassle of trying to get a replacement. Bought a Sony cord at a local Wal-Mart for about $13. Learned my lesson."
5,Quality Cable,Simply put this is a quality cable. I can elaborate but hearing is believing. The sound quality of an optical system is instantly appreciated.
2,Bait and switch. It works however.,"This is the description of the item: ""...Accept no substitutes! Your Tripp Lite cable will be shipped to you in its original Tripp Lite packaging (poly bag with Tripp Lite logo; see photo). This is your assurance that the cable you purchase will deliver the superior performance you expect. And if you don't see this packaging, it's not a genuineTripp Lite cable!..."" However, when I received the cable, it was just a generic, no-name cable, in a clear bulk-packaging bag. I bought it from Eforcity.The cable works though."
1,No Science behind this book! Beware,"This is a complete 180 degree away from the truth. If you want to see who is working for the $ then look no furhter then Preston Long, Ph'D. Not just some of this book is lies but all of it. If you read James Chestnut,DC's book the ""14 Premises"" then you would have the complete scientific proof behind how chiropractic works and helps the body to improve its health and well-being!"
4,The Best Lost Punk Rock Nobody Heard,"The 77's Ping Pong Over the Abyss was a volley in the moment but when All Fall Down hit the few of us who heard it realized that something serious and fun was going on. I have a cassette of it that is still playable but losing the oxide and as many times as I play it there's a freshness and unfinished-ness to it. Well worth hearing, wish these guys had more backing when they hit."
5,The Best Album You'll Hear All Year!,"In a word, simply amazing...This LP showcase's Fugazi's instrumental prowess from the hard core punk on their earlier records like ""Repeater"" to the more experimental stuff on ""In On The Kill Taker"", they are the last band left that have stayed true to themselves from the beginning..I suggest people should also check out the video documentary of ""Instrument"" if you want to hear the exclusive live performances which should have been also included on the soundtrack."
4,"Classic, melodramatic, gothic novel","I love the genre, so I am a little biased. It was fast, enjoyable read that I couldn't put down. I loved the setting and the plot ideas. True, it wasn't believable, but that is the nature of the gothic novel. I enjoyed the dramatic dialogue and I really like the ghosts.But, I do have a couple of complaints. The plot was way to predictable. I kept turning the pages waiting for the twist, but I already knew all the secrets pretty much from the first third of the book. This didn't stop me from enjoying it though.And the female character, Kate, really wasn't all that loveable.To sum it up, if you love gothic ghost stories, it is a must read, but it is not the very best I have read."
5,Claudia is great,Claudia's receipes are the best. She makes everything so easy to recreate at home. Her ingredients are easy to find and easy to work with. My kids all have their own favorites. My son especially loves her blueberry cornbread cake. He had it at the restaurant and has been waiting for this book so we can make it at home. Thanks Claudia --- it's great!!
5,"intense flavors, innovative desserts","LOVE this cookbook. Fleming is a genius at marrying flavor and form. I've made the Cherry Cheesecake Tart with a Red Wine Glaze several times, substituting strawberries for cherries and other variations, and I just love it. I made it for my Wine Club when we tried Syrahs and I used one for the glaze. A knock-out. Such an elegant dish -- one of so many that really wow. The tart's texture is just beautiful and it carries the flavor perfectly.I'm dying to make the Tamarind-Glazed Mango Napoleons.This is a really innovative and imaginative cookbook. Delicious, modern combinations and techniques. Highly recommended. GREAT gift, because the recipient will have to make you something delicious!"
4,THERE'S AN ERROR!!!,"In the recipe for the Lemon Lime Souffle Tart (Pp. 79-80) the ingredients for the filling call for 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons of sugar but the directions only give instructions for 10 tablespoons of the sugar (5 used in Step 5 and 5 used in Step 7). There is no accounting for when to use the remaining sugar which sits lonely in its bowl. If you follow the directions step by step sequentially, all you will have is wasted time, energy, and a mess to clean up along with a baked crust that yearns to be filled. Claudia Fleming, Melissa Clark and Random House should be ashamed that they couldn't bother proofreading this book, or at the least posting a notice with sale with a correction."
4,Took The Edge Off My Fender Blues Deluxe Reissue,"To me, the stock 12"" speaker that came with my Fender Blues Deluxe Reissue sounded too brittle. Even if I messed with the presence and EQ knobs it just always accentuated the highs too much for me. I had read reviews on this speaker and decided to pull the trigger and get one. I haven't regretted the purchase.I was hoping the improvement would be the same as when I put a 10"" Ragin Cagin in my Fender Super Champ XD. Wasn't the case. It DID, however, fix the problem I purchased the speaker for. My Blues Deluxe now sounds warmer to me and doesn't have that accentuated high-end that it did before. All in all it was a good upgrade and I'd do it again.~Slick"

4,"This item works as it should, but the battery is hard to place in","This item was shipped in record time! It was packaged appropriately. It works as it should. My only complaint is that the battery must be attached to a receiver (I don't know what it is really called), then very difficultly you have to place it just right to get it to get the electric current."
3,gogo tees,"Although the golf tees are very good, the shipping charge was very high resulting in 50 tees costing $.50 apiece. I will not buy them again."
2,Disappointing,"All throughout undergrad, I always used textbooks as reference material to use if I had unanswered questions from lecture. If that's what you're looking for, stay away from this book. If you're a student who's reading for comprehension rather than learning just the basics, this will be a disappointing read."
2,Poor recording quality,The songs were great but the CD recording quality was very poor. The cuts sounded overdriven and distorted on every player I tried it on.
4,Aldila,"It seems this is the shaft for better than average amateur players. I did reshafted using Aldila 65.350 on my oldy Callaway Steelhead, and indeed, my old Steel Head revived. Also it added 15 more yars of distance. The quality of product is excellent and anyone who considers reshafting may wish look into this ---."
2,Poorly written. Lacks depth,This is a poorly written book. The exercises supposedly on the CD are not there. The book gives a flavour of the app. but concentrates too much on the audio aspects of Vegas. There is better information avaialble online.
5,A Painful Mirror Into Our Present Situation,"""Learning to Eat Soup with a Knife"" is an essential read for anyone hoping to make sense out of America's current situation in Iraq.

5,still working after three years,"I bought this DVD player three years ago and use it almost everyday and it still works well. My kids have spilled drinks on the player part so the buttons stopped working, but I can still operate it with the remote. My kids have even walked and kneeled on the player and it still works."
2,Disappointed for the price,I purchased this DVD player at Target. It has been used 2 or 3 times. The one monitor now has 2 big black spots in the screen and the cable for monitor one has to be wiggled in just right for the monitor to work. I payed a good chunk of money for a poor quality product.
1,Don't waste you money,"The concept and design is great but, every time my HVAC comes on the night light comes on as well. Very annoying."
1,Incorrect description,This light does not go off during the daytime in room with open windows. Also comes on for no reason at random times.
2,3 out of 5 worked,"Bought 4 of these. One did not work. I was sent a replacement, but it didn't work. So out of the 5 that were delivered, only 3 worked. Not sure why they were broken, I would like to have more, but afraid to order anymore."
3,Good design but 2 out of 5 ordered stopped working within 1 week,"I like this product very much, however only 3 out of the 5 that I recieved are still working, they have a limited lifetime warranty so I will be sending 2 back to the manufacturer for replacements.Even so, I would buy again because it is a great product, but it is a sad fact that their quality control is terrible, at least for the batch of nightlights I bought, (40% failure rate in the 1st week). Like most small electronics these days, they are not made in this country, however that is no longer a good excuse for poor quality control."
2,"Decent quality, but will light up even in bright sunlight","I actually have 2 of these. The motion sensing is good. The timing of the light is OK too. However, I paid a premium for a light that would not waste energy during the day. This nightlight is also a daylight -- it will light up when sensing motion even when the sun is actually shining on it."
1,DOA,"While in the dark, unplugged the existing bulb night light, plugged this one in and instant ... dark. Pulled it out, it seemed to flash for moment and I got hopeful. Nope. The best it would do is a flash every now and then while wiggling or squeezing it... dead on arrival and going back. GE made in China, figures."
2,Interesting But Tedious,"Knowing that this book was written by Theodore Roosevelt makes it an important book regardless of the actual text. TR's influence on the strategic importance of seapower can be traced back to his feelings as a young author. The book itself was tedious and not very inspiring. It's interesting to glimpse the feelings of the young, strong, post-Civil War American writing the book. As far as a history of the War of 1812, you can do much better elsewhere."
5,Roosevelt's inimitable style,"This very well-written account, surprising from a youth of only 23, gives balanced portrayals of most of the major sea battles between the fledgling American navy, and the Lord of the Seas, Great Britain. In it, Roosevelt backs up his praise of American maritime ingenuity and the seaworthiness and discipline of its sailors with proofs, citations and cautious but sound reasoning. In each, diagrams of the engagements are provided, as well as other documented statistics, without overloading the reader with details, yet there are plenty of those. Roosevelt describes the handling of each ship and the actions of its captains with minute detail, without being, to the layman, purely technical. Although Roosevelt beats the patriotic drum, he also swings a corrective switch, against our commanders and our partisan historians, when their actions are faulty and objectionable -- a fact which underscores his fairmindedness and the authenticity of his rendering."
3,okay,"My son really likes Elmo,but for some reason he doesn't care for this book. We have had it for almost a year and still is not interested in letting me read it to him and he never looks through it himself. Not sure why. I'm not that impressed with it either."
2,Too old for child,This is a quality book for older children. But for my 2 and 4 year olds it is too detailed and not simple enough. It is confusing when speaking about the letters.
5,This CD is uber 1337,This is one of the best Industrial Underground collections raw and hardcore. If you like Industrial this is a must have.it is freakin 1337 as hell.Buy it now now i say or the evil clown will get you
4,"actually, the ranch was SUPPOSED to be the ""country"" Police","just a quick note to share with all of you that when Miles Copeland got involved with Keith and the guys, the intention was, in fact, to try and create a sort of country flavored Police, because of Copeland's Police connection...It didnt turn out that way and Keith has made a pretty big solo name for himself, but I think the guys definitely could have filled an interesting niche....and just so you know, I admit outright that I have a vested interest as my friend Cyril Rawson and I wrote ""Just Some Love"" which the guys did so nicely on the record...I hope they get rediscovered to the point that Cyril and I can write our next hit for them in our beach houses in Malibu!!...in the meantime, best of luck to them all...and I hope all of you enjoy the CD........."
5,Urban Original,"Although I already owned 2 copies of the original Ranch CD, I jumped at the chance to buy the re-release with 2 additional tracks and 2 videos. For those of you not familiar with Keith Urban prior to his solo career, he was in a band with 2 other muscians, Jerry Flowers and Peter Clarke. The band was called the Ranch, and this was the only CD they released. For some reason country radio did not take notice of the great rockin' country music these 3 guys made together. The group disbanded, Keith went solo, and the rest is history. Now the Ranch is finally getting the recognition it deserved. The combination of Keith and Jerry make for some beautiful harmonies, particulary on the song Desiree. I love this CD. If you don't add this to your music collection, you are missing out on one great CD. Try it today, and I bet you'll agree."
3,In The Ranch: A must have for any true Urbanite!,"This CD will truely enhance any music lovers library. Besides the incredible music, you are also treated too two very rare music video's of Keith for your computer. These alone are worth buying the cd, but you are also treated too 12 tracks of fantastic music along with two bonus (encore) tracks. Number 13, Stuck in The Middle With You, is a remake from a 70's (I believe it was released then) hit which I just love. Number 4, Some Days You Gotta Dance, is another favorite of mine. Okay, I don't have enough room to review each song, so trust me when I say they are all equally wonderfull! ;o) Buy it. Crank it. Enjoy it. I'm sure any Keith Urban fan will love it!"
2,Not Terrible,As stated in other reviews this album is much more country than later KU albums. And while I like country albums and Keith Urban this one just doesn't do it for me. I think it lacks a punch and a production that later albums possess. There simply seems to be something missing and maybe it is just the wall of sound that seems to come from Defying Gravity and the many guitars and stringed instruments present on that album.
5,All you do is laugh! Great for parties!,"I recently played Don't Make Me Laugh Jr. with a group of children from a local YMCA. We all laughed so hard! Shy kids came out of their shells. The more theatrical kids also had a load of fun. Aside from the fun, we learned how to listen better, work as a team, and how to laugh at ourselves! Everyone ends up a winner when they play. I love the game!"
2,Disappointing,"I was so excited to get this game after all the reviews, boy was I disappointed. Game doesn't have a strategy and a lot of the cards are not fun to act out, there needs to be a purpose to the game not just read the card and do what it says and then off to the next person. The title makes you think if you make someone laugh you get points but that isn't true at all, you just do what the card says and move to the next player. Nobody in my family cared for it, including my 5 yr old."
5,The 'UNDO' Command,"Hiding in their bunkers beneath a blasted world, the inhabitants of Sirgol are still not defeated. They have a unique colony world; their civilization is as old as Earth's, since Sirgol is the only planet known where time-travel can happen, and the first colonists dropped back thousands of years. Now the berserker machines have found them, and almost beaten them by scouring off the surface of their world, but the Sirgolians still have a chance as they fight the machines through the loops and bends of their planet's earthlike history. And on Sirgol, you can really go back and make it not happen. Saberhagen's berserkers are always a scary concept, but here they have a different side. It's a question critical to my own survival: how complicated can a machine be before it can be said to be 'alive?'"
5,Delicious.,"Scottie dogs. SCOTTIE DOGS. These are truly delicious treat, putting Red Vines into shame. My six year withdrawals from these things was well worth the relapse, as these are truly hard to find. Thank you amazon."
3,A Little Anthropology,"A Little Anthropology, by Dennison Nash, provides a much needed break from the tedium usually associated with books about Anthropology. The book presents crucial vocabular in context and does not burden the reader with excessive jargon. The sytle is easy to read and is presented in a convienent format, which separates the author's commentary from interesting case studies. The case studies provide realistic examples of the methods the author describes. The one flaw is that the author usually takes a negative view toward Western and American culture. In one sentence, the author will explain cultural relativity and then berate American culture in the next. It is an unfortunate double standard."
1,HELLO! WRONG PICTURE,"Who is the person that uploaded a JUDAS PRIEST album cover and named it ""Los Lonely Boys?"" Someone needs to fix this."
1,Not up to snuff,"Let's for a moment pretend that Depp's character Raphael, from the Italian tribe of course, is a strip of wallpaper. One day this wallpaper decides it's not good enough for the house anymore and gets in touch with an interior decorator, played by Marlon Brando in a convincing turn as Jabba the Hut sans special effects, who eventually sets this strip of wallpaper on fire in a fit of sadistic glee. But you literally have to watch the wallpaper glue dry for an hour or so before you go from the old batch to the new batch. You never even actually see the new wallpaper gracing the walls; perhaps our evil home decorator skips town without ever installing it. But isn't that just like life? And I'm sure that's what Depp was trying to tell us with this coma-inducing treat. So buckle up and move on to the next review."
3,Not as good as McCormick,I'm a huge fan of the McCormick brand gravy mix and I assumed that this would be as good. It isn't. It's not bad enough for a 2 but i'm annoyed that i convinced myself to buy a case of this stuff instead of the McCormick.
4,Works,"It works. The dot could be a bit more focused, the covers could be flip up, could be brighter or even easier to adjust. Perhaps it could have been made a bit more sold. But all that said it would have cost a lot more money.You get what you pay for, and this is what I paid for, at this price point I think it was a good value and should work just fine, no play in the rail when I mounted it on my 10/22 and it stayed true through several mags. Over all an average product that just works."
1,Get what you pay for,"At $30.00 you get what you pay for. It's a crap shoot as to what quality you get. Mine works O.K. just won't hold zero on my 22LR, also one mounting screw or nut stripped out first time (with very little effort) mounting the scope. I'm going to try to contact Tasco customer service and see if I can get a couple more sets."
3,Ok red dot,This red dot is not very good. The dot moves a lot with your head movement. This however was pretty decent for the price compared to a few other cheap ones I bought.
5,perfect size,i heard about this frying pan on america's test kitchen and haven't been disaappointed with the results. makes perfect eggs and lots more
2,buckles/bows in center on induction cooker,"The good reviews are mostly right - but the one I got - bought specifically because it is supposed to work on induction cookers - it does - but bows/buckles/raises in the center when cooking so that oil or sauce runs to the edges.Very disappointing - because of the very good reviews, but did not work for me on induction."
5,Great Pan,"Purchased this after purchasing the 12-1/2 inch version of this pan. I found out about T-Fal Professional on America's Test Kitchen, and ordered the 12-1/2 inch. It's a really great pan, but sometimes a little large. The 8 inch is just perfect for our needs and gets daily use. The T-Fal Professional line is not the same T-Fal you see at the big box or department store, it is heavier and better quality. You may pay a little more, but it is worth it."
4,Only Ovensafe to 350F? - NOT SO! - It's 450F!,"I was very interested in this skillet because Cook's Illustrated's review (September 2010) says that it is ovensafe to 450F and that the nonstick surface is exceptionally good and long lasting.Unfortunately the Amazon and T-Fal websites state that it is only ovensafe to 350F. To clear up this discrepancy, I checked with Cook's Illustrated and also with T-Fal. It turns out that after re-testing, T-Fal has changed the ovensafe rating to 450F but has failed to do so on their Website and on their packaging, although they have planned to do it.Cook's tested the higher temperature by making frittatas and finishing them under the broiler. They did wrap the handles in heavy-duty foil to protect them from the direct heat and the pans did well.Consequently, I've upped my rating from 3 to 4 stars.I need a skillet with a lid; according to other reviewers, standard lids do not fit this pan."
5,Pan-tastic!,"WOW. I had no idea that I could love a pan so much! I've always bought those cheap kits, because, well... I'm cheap when it comes to kitchen stuff. What a mistake! After the handle fell off of one of the cheap pans, I decided I'd rather have one great pan than a collection of crappy ones. I decided to build a good collection of pans starting with this one and I am so pleased with it. It heats evenly and is completely non-stick. I made pancakes on it and I had no idea I could make such beautiful pancakes. They looked like ones from a restaurant! I am actually excited to cook now and I will definitely be adding more pots and pans from this brand in the future."
5,quick delivery,Very nice pan for the price. Highly recommended by America's Test Kitchen. Don't put in dishwasher to maximize coating lifetime. America's test kitchen also recommends using a tiny bit of oil to maximize coating lifetime.
1,hotspots,"I had bought some nonstick frying pans based on recommendations from Cook's Illustrated or America's Kitchen, and they were good but not long lasting. so I had high hopes for this pan. IT'S TERRIBLE. Very obvious hot center, at least on an electric stove. Terrible. Fine for a saute, really terrible for something like quesadillas or pancakes.FOLLOW-UP - I've had this a few months now, and it has WARPED so that the inside isn't flat. When you add some oil (because you will need to sooner than later), it runs to the outer edges. But the heat is strongest in the center, where there is no oil, and everything will burn and stick. I HATE THIS PAN."
4,Lids Don't Fit,"This is a great pan. Easy to clean and nothing sticks BUT your 12"" lids won't fit!! This is a 12 1/2"" pan, not 12"" and I don't think they sell a lid to fit. I wouldn't want another lid anyway. So beware."
4,"Sturdy, non-stick seems durable, but a bit heavy","Sturdy, non-stick seems durable. Even though a bit heavy, I think I'll collect a few more sizes of this brand. It's also super easy to clean because the outside is also non-stick. Sometimes, when I'm cooking 2 separate dishes in the same pan, all I need to do is wipe it in between."
4,Has lasted quite well with proper care,"While I haven't found the ""Thermo-Spot Heat Indicator"" too terribly useful, the non-stick surface has held up quite well for the past 15 months. (I use an infrared thermometer similar toRosewill REGD-TN439L0 Infrared Thermometer.) The T-fal is definitely a better product than other non-stick pans!"
5,Best Non-Stick Pan Ever,"Looking for a quality, heavyweight saute pan? This is it! This is from T-Fal's PROFESSIONAL line and there is a huge difference! The quality is evident the minute you pick up the pan. I have used this product for over two years now and highly recommend this line of T-Fal cookware. You won't be disappointed, I promise!"
2,Not as good as the others,All of the other flavors we have tried have been excellent this one isn't. I wouldn't suggest it.
4,Not a Western but How the North of Australia was settled!,"I have read anything I can get my hands on regarding the history of Northern Australia, and although this book is fiction, it is a fair account of the hardships that was endured by the early settlers of the North. I would recommend it to anyone as a good read, espicially if you intend coming to the Cairns area for a holiday."
3,Informative but spare,"I may be the only person ever to read this book that doesn't think it's a landmark in herpetocultural literature. Oh well. For the record, I found the information sound, and I was pleased by the book's wealth of information about snake ailments. However, this is not a book for anyone who does not already know how to care for his or her Python regius. The discussion of basic care information is, I thought, inadequate, and De Vosjoli in particular seems to regard these snakes as incredibly delicate, look-but-don't-touch animals. If you are interested in ball pythons, buy this book, but don't buy *only* this book."
3,review on Ball python manual,i like this book very much. IT includes very important infofor a first time snake owner like me. it is very useful and i thank him for it
5,an inspirational fiction romance novel,"Love Comes Softly is an inspirational fiction romance novel that you just won't want to put down until the last word is read. Author Janette Oke's warm writing style will win your heart and tug at your heartstrings while delivering a picturesque prairie lifestyle. Love Comes Softly will take you back to a time where daily life was a struggle, but non-the-less triumphant. It was a pleasure reading the saga of main characters Clark and Marty (her real name is Martha). Their life complications are captivating."
3,Would love it with better dialog,"I absolutely loved the Love Comes Softly movies so bought the books, the original version. These books would be so good if it weren't for the awful dialog. I just can't get past it. Example: ""We'll find everythin' we want there in thet new country. The land's there fer the takin."" ""What 'bout a house? It'll be most winter when we git there."" Does anyone know if the revised versions of the books cleaned up the dialog or did they just change the covers? Such a shame. I was really looking forward to reading these books! Or should I say, ""readin' them thar books!"""
4,Beautiful love story,"I spent an entire day and evening watching the series, Love Comes Softy, on the Hallmark Channel a few weeks ago. I knew immediately that I had to read these books. There are times when I crave nothing more than a simple story about people, their hardships, their faith, and the love that they share. This book has all of that and more. I truly admire our ancestors that lived during the early 1800s and who were brave enough to venture into the unexplored west. After turning the last page, my appreciation for those that came before me increased tenfold and my heart was enveloped within the pages of Matty and Clark Davis' love story."
3,There are better...,"Of the Live in New York City series, volumes 6 and 7 are fairly weak. If you're looking for Jaco in a tight, small combo / club setting, you're better off with volumes 2, 4 and 5 from this series."
3,"Cheap, but works","This thing is way cheap, but it works. I would rather buy a cheap one, that I have to get up and switch, than to buy one that cost more with a remote. I have to many remotes around anyways. I like to play Xbox online, but my wife does not like to hear all the noise from COD, so I got wireless head phones at ROSS and I plug the wireless receiver into the switch box. I use it mostly for the audio inputs. I plug the video in the back of my tv and the audio cables into the switch box. Then I plug the switch box into my surround sound system. It works pretty good."
4,"Good, basic AV switch","There's nothing fancy about this AV switch, but it works as it's supposed to and the inputs are laid out in an efficient design. I like the fact that one set is on the front of the switch, so one could easily plug a gaming console or something of that nature in front of the set. The only thing I don't like about this switch is that it feels a bit insubstantial. I am careful when pressing the buttons so I don't break it. But overall it works fine, good buy!"
5,Glad Force Flex trash bags,Great fitting bags for my kitchen trash can--the quick tie feature is superior to the drawstring bags as it is not as tight-fitting on the rim and less likely to rip.
2,"Not serious, but entertaining.","I guess in 1989, people didn't know that the famous ""Plesiosaur"" carcass lifted by a japanese fishing vessel was in a 95% probability a decaying basking shark. But to present those photographs as prime proof of actual Plesiosaur existence in our century (without the carcass) is a little far out, in my opinion. And that is the general tone of this video, made in a very obvious entertainment spirit. Also, it is very average quality-wise (video, direction) but I give it a midrange rating as it shows nowhere else available (in my knowledge) footage of ""Chessie"" (the Chesapeake Bay Monster. Warning: it is very unclear) and at least a little tour on other-than-Nessie lake monsters. Another warning: It is a rather short feature."
1,"it's so thin, also has really bad smell","if they gave it to me for free, I will not use it. It's thin, smelly, and makes your skin itchy. returned for a refund the very next day"
2,Just justice,"Just reading the title turned me off. Muder. What murder? This Jesus knowingly broke Roman law by claiming to be the king of the Jews. In ancient Rome this was a capital offence. The man was arrested, tried by his peers, found guilty and sentenced to death by the customary method of crucifiction. So where's the murder? Anyway, what's all the hub bub? The point was to come to earth and die for the sins of mankind in the first place. At any rate, Jesus dies, rises from the dead and goes to heaven as a zombie. But that, dear reader, is another story."
1,Beware! Bait and Switch!,"Do not buy this from Polsteins Home & Beyond (They are the default)! They don't even carry them, but instead try and slip you the far inferior model 8510 Home Project Calc. They then promise to e-mail you a return label, and then don't do anything at all. I have just reported this company to the FTC for fraud. If you have been scammed by Polsteins Home & Beyond, either by the old Bait and Switch, or another unethical and illegal business practice, report them to the FTC at: www.ftc.gov. Be aware of your rights, the FTC says that if they send you something other than what you ordered YOU DON""T HAVE TO RETURN IT! They must still refund your money."
2,Where Is My Pea Soup?,"My intuition was correct in waiting until this was available on dvd to view. First off, the first hour into the film not only is the plot all over the place (if any), but you recognize similar scenes from Hannibal, Indiana Jones, Apocalypse Now, and The Omen, just to mention a few. The movie was too confusing, and exasperating for the first hour, one kept expecting father Merrin to battle the demon, but none of that happened.The Art in the film especially the cathedral was beautiful, and the casting was wonderful. At the beginning the film seemed promising, but the maggots, the stillborn, the hyenas, Nazis and the Kenya tribe how did that, relate to what eventually happens to Regan in D.C. in the 70's?"
3,MMMHH INTERESTING,"I really agree with all of you. I wasn't born in 1973 so I saw the 2000 version. Anyway, It scared me a lot, very well done there's no doubt about it. But I keep on asking myself how the hell will they be able to present ""secret"" or ""unrevealed"" plots without creating an anoying movie? It may be dangerous, and Im scared of the result because of today's effects... You know damn well what made THE EXORCIST so famous...its reality. I mean, you could believe in it because everything was so real. If the effects are badly used, as it was the case in the III...this movie will be a failure. On the other hand, if they succeeded in doing something strong, maybe as strong as the original, then be prepared to have a great time...how will pazuzu then look like? Just wait and see..."
2,Skip this crappy film,"Genre: HorrorGenre Grade: B-Final Grade: C-This prequel ain't got nothing on the original, but it still offered a few thrills to get me interested. It seemed like it was incredibly long, and in the end it tries to shock you with a surprise but you really don't even care enough to notice. The characters were weak (unlike the original) and the plot was too reliant on traditional ""suspense"" moments of the horror genre. This movie could have been a lot better I think, especially when it's focused on the (fictional) spot where Lucifer fell from Heaven. The few moments of demonic possession did hold true to the original, which I give the director some credit for, though not much. Skip this one unless you really love the Exorcist franchise."
2,Exorcist: The Beginning (...And Hopefully The End).,"Enough already! THE EXORCIST is one of the greatest horror flicks ever made and all of these sequels, prequels... they will always come up short in comparison.I don't know what to make of EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING. I didn't hate it but I didn't particularly like it either.Is it a mystery-thriller? Is it a ""sand & desert"" action-adventure flick, with British troops pitted against African natives? Or perhaps it's an old fashioned story of love from a distance? I don't know. But it's certainly not a horror flick.On the plus side, Stellan Skarsgard gives a great performance."
1,IT BURNS!!!!,This film is an abomination to true horror fans. Petition for the release of the original Paul Schrader version of this film. The Power of Christ compells you!!!!!This film is only slightly better then Exorcist 2:The Heritic and that still makes it terrible.
3,Okay,"An okay movie to sit through. Its a simple plot, and the only reason this movie deserves 3 stars is because of the last 30 minutes or so. This movie is about an archeological dig that discovers a church from ancient christianity. Mayhem persues, and all hell is let loose. This movie has a great deal of violence, most of it graphic."
2,Demon woman vs FatherJones,"After getting excited about this film I was completely disappointed. While there are the standard scares here and there, in the end its just plain ridiculous. I was laughing through the entire last scene between the possessed and the priest. Maybe if they had a couple of lightsabers it would have added to the excitement. This is nothing more then trying to make a fast buck on the word ""Exorcist."" Yes the first was good but I wouldn't say the greatest. It hit at a time when the world was much more gullable. One has to wonder if the ""The Exorcist"" was to be released today if it would become the legend it is. Fear not; rumor has it a re-make may be in the works. Uhg!"
5,This album was thoroughly enjoyable.,"I was introduced to Chayanne's music through a friend who let me borrow a cd of his. Even, though I am not fluent in Spanish, I really enjoyed the whole album. Volver a Nacer is a great mix of fast upbeat songs and slow soothing ones. Just one listen and you'll agree, Volver a Nacer is a musical treat!!"
4,"Loved, but not the most durable","My (now almost 3-year-old) daughter received this dinosaur set as a gift last Christmas. While she is very big into toy animals, she had never had toy dinosaurs before. She LOVED them right from day one! As she has had these dinos for nearly a year now, they still remain one of the toys she plays with lots, whereas the ""fun"" of many of her other toys has worn off. The only negative thing I can say about these dinosaurs is that the pterodactyl's head popped off when she first got the set (and he was immediately one of her favorites, so she wasn't very happy about that!). The t-rex has also gotten a ""scratch"" on him, but that doesn't seem to bother her. (He just sometimes has to go on trips to the ""doctor"" (played by either another dinosaur or animal of some sort!) to get checked out. She LOVES the brontosaurus, who is her favorite color, blue. My daughter is very, very happy with this toy."
5,Bravo!,In my opinion there aren't a lot of well-written Study Guides available for IIS-4 at this time. This is one of them. Mr. Isiminger's writing style actually makes this book a pleasure to read. The two sample tests (with complete explanations) at the end of the book provide an excellent review of the material.
4,I think I've found the right manga!,"Being a fan of paranormal/horror/mystery/suspense works, I was drawn to this via an internet recommendation. And it works. The suspense as Light tries to find L is quite good. As someone who is only just starting to read manga, this one is good for people who enjoy suspense novels. It's not exactly the light reading that people usually associate from manga."
3,Not a miracle worker,"In an attempt to not make things any worse, the compounds used are on the mild side, and they won't remove real bad scratches, nor gouges. That being said, it will work out lighter scratches and intermediate scratches. It even did a great job on the back of my 5G iPod."
5,Passionate,This CD glorifies God through the whole thing with total passion. You can feel the spirit through the music. I think you will dig this album.
5,Dewalt DW511 review,"With only one opportunity to use the product I am very happy with its performance. If I had a improvement suggestion, I would say the product should be available with its own case. All of my other portable Dewalt tools are cased."
2,not happy,so it is not the drill that i am unhappy with. it is the fact that here i was ordering a christmas present for my husband and while reveiwing the item there is a picture of the drill with a bag. so of course i super impressed with the fact that i was getting a great deal on a dewalt drill with case and when it gets to my house and i open it the is no case. that was very disappointing! when i went to contact the seller which i am pretty sure is amazon itself there was no where to click like on other items i have bought. i would not recommend this product as a gift since it is to my standars an uncomplete gift with false advertisement!
2,Poor chuck,"The Dewalt hammer drill; this drill has a keyed chuck, this chuck is very oor it will not hold a bit,believe me! I got it really tite,but the drill will not hold, in fact, my old one was the same , when I tried to remove the old chuck and install a new chuck I purached for $40.00 dollars I and 3 other guys could not get the old chuck of the drill shaft, so I deceied to purchase a new drill, Dewalt must get a new type chuck for this drill, Iam shipping mine back."
5,Dewalt makes a real hammer,"The DeWalt DW 511 met all of my needs and without any hickups. I needed to install electrical boxes as well as hanger bracket on 52 Ft of foundation wall that was 14 Ft high. In addition, the ceiling was also cement and it required numerous lighting fixtures to be instaled from the under side. The work was hard but by using the DW511 instead of my Mikita hammer drill that kept overheating, I cut the time in half and with ease. I'd recommend this drill for this type of work any day."
2,For beginners only,"I found that the majority of the exercises described in the book were ones that would be part of any good training progam. If you are a beginner to training, this book will help to get you started. If you believe that increased fitness will not improve your golf game, this book should change your mind. If you have been training, don't bother to buy this book, since you are probably doing these exercises anyway.Also, if you are not a member of a fitness club or have a vast home collection of dumbbells, a treadmill, stationary bike, as well as a home gym machine, don't bother to buy this book. The exercises and sample programs require this equipment, which will cost at least $1,000."
4,Good cheap N.T. to hand out.,"It's cheap ... not beautifully bound or anything. Buy two or three, and have them ready to give away. Spread the Word of God as revealed through His Son, Jesus Christ, the Messiah.'To preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.' I Cor. 1:17"
2,There are MUCH better Sinatra tributes than this ... Zzzzzzzzzzz,"Bland, bland, bland. The chief hipster himself was NEVER this snooze inducing. Stamp it ""Sominex"" and pass. Enough said."
2,Give me a break.,I cannot believe I paid money for this. Here is the self-help book for the Billy Bobs of the world. Platitudes and obvious recommendations are not worth the $12.
2,Book Explosion...Not as Good as it Seems...,"This book has a good idea, but some of the interpretation is not right. As I have heard before... the best interpretation is no interpretation. Although I think that this book has a great layout of learning Biblical Principles, it has questionable content that I would not recommend to others. This book has become very popular among people in our country, but it is important to remember that we need to look at what the Bible says, not simply take the interpretation of scripture from others.-Christian Fobian, Author of Why Christ?"
1,from faith to faith,"Rick Warren is a believer in the Scriptures, and he has a very good focus on its message. Thus, he speaks from his faith to my faith, for I am cut out of the same cloth. The European philosophers, beginning with the end of the 18th century, scrubbed the faith of which Warren so eloquently speaks, from the hearts and minds of Christians in Europe. (God may be there, somewhere, but you are the captain of your fate.) This thinking has come to America and has infected much of American citizenry, through the universities of our land. Warren attacks this and other agnostic and atheistic views with the power of the Holy Scripture. Magister Warren, floreas, crescas, vivas!Rev. Prof. emeritus Bruce R. Backer"
4,Great value,Got this book in hardback for a terrific price. Arrived in a timely manner. The book offersa challenge to one looking to improve his/her life and find God's purpose for it. I would recommend the bookto any Christian.
5,A greatness surrounds this book,"Some challenge the way we perceive life. Others try to force beliefs on us. This book tries to explain both, while inspiring the spirit within us. None have been this enlightening, at least not so magnificantly as this book. It changes the way we see ourselves through the light of our intuition, filtering through our spirit to a new consciousness. This book challenges all of those people who are yet to accept themselves and moves those people who have started to. This and another book called Dreams: Gateway to the True Self are among the most inspiring books I've read in the past decade. Dreams is about the transition of self from adolecence to adulthood by reflection of intuition onto the perceptions of reality by way of dreams, philosophy, and psychology. I highly recommend this book as a present or a personal gift to yourself."
5,The truth is still the truth,"In this newest edition of The Purpose Driven Life, the truth is still the same. God loves you. He has a plan for you. He will finish what he started. The good news is still the good news.The book is updated with more content (2 additional chapters) as well as links to online content that expands the message of this book. This would be fantastic in ebook form on a digital device where the reader could upload the videos as chapters are read.I read the original Purpose Driven Life 10 years ago. It was, and still is, a life-changing book. If your life has been changed by this book, you do not need to read it again. But since 10 years have passed, there is a whole generation of believers who may not have been transformed by this book. This book is for them.Thomas Nelson provided me a free copy of this book in exchange for my review which I freely give."
1,Warning! Not of the Holy Spirit.,"By the time I was half way through chapter one of this book I felt funny about it. By the time I was finished (I did not do the 40 day thing.), I was certain that this book was not inspired by, directed by, or done in conjunction with the Holy Spirit. I would not recomment this book to anyone."
1,Be afraid.... Be very afraid....,"I was given this book as a Christmas present, and though I do believe in faith and consider myself to be a spiritual person, I couldn't make it thru the first few chapters of this book. I found many parts of it offensive. Particularly passages suggesting that ambition and goals are selfish, unless they're focused 100% on God. I do believe in keepin' the faith and leading a rewarding life. I don't believe that wanting to do my best in my career and sharing good times with friends and wanting a comfortable life is sinful or a betrayal or attack on God. I was tempted to skip to the end to see if there was a recipe for the famous Jim Jones cynide kool-aid, or a detailed map to the Koresh compound in Waco."
1,Oh my poor God,This is not inclusive. This is divisive. It's one more huge crack in religion as the Western World understands it. I agree with the last reviewer. When will we ever stop thinking about God as Big Daddy? I hope when I have kids they won't get this kind of thing stuffed down their poor little throats. What am I saying? Of course they won't. Not if I have anything to say about it.
5,One of My All Time Favorites,The Purpose Driven Life continues to be one of the all time bestsellers and is one of my all time favorite books. Warren really captures the essence of defining oneself and one's purpose in the huge thing called life. I really enjoyed reading this updated version and hope others will commit to the practice of reading the book and applying the principles to their daily lives. AWESOME READ!!!
2,Not groundbreaking,"I picked up this book upon the recommendation of many friends. This book might be helpful for new Christians, or those who prefer an easy to read, repetitive approach to Christianity.For those looking for a deeper Christian experience, or thoughtful reading that challenges you - I would encourage you to look elsewhere. Personally I like books by Brian McLaren much better (favorite being ""More Ready than you Realize.""I couldn't stand this book anymore after reading about 1/3 of it."
1,What's the big deal?,"I read a third of this book. Got bored. Put it down.There's nothing unique or new in his message and the book is redundant.Good Christian books are:The Life Application Bible - Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.""The Case for Christ"" and ""The Case for Faith"" are excellent.Also ""Mere Christianity"" by C.S. Lewis is a little harder read but an excellent book."
5,Excellent to do in small groups,I really like the book and we will do it during our 40 days of fasting and prayer in the church in several small groups. I highly recommend it.
3,it's just okay,Lots of interesting food for thought. Don't really buy alot of the authors beliefs. Takes the bible a bit too litterally for my mind.
2,Vital Doctrines Are Missing,"My wife and I were given this New York Times Bestseller several years ago, and I read it a couple of times. The book is designed to be read over a course of 40 days, which I did in my first reading, but in my second reading I completed it in a few days. The Purpose Driven Life answers life's most important question: What on earth am I here for? If you don't know the answer, reading Warren's book will provide you the answer in a way that is easy to understand. Even if you are a Christian, this book provides some wise counsel that can help you live life for the glory of God. Unfortunately there are some major elements lacking in this book. Vital doctrines that are missing include man's sinfulness and our need for a Savior, the substitute sacrifice of the sinless Christ who bore our sin on the cross. For a serious critique of Rick Warren's Purpose Drive Life (from a reformed perspective), I highly recommend visiting Tim Challies' blog."
3,Fundamentalism for the Masses,"If you already have a fundamentalist inclination, then this book will provide valuable confirmation and focus for you. It's a manifesto for the 21st century true believer. A bit like a 'Charles Atlas' program for christians.If you are not already a true believer, then this audiobook will do little for you. The most compelling arguement for faith here is that if you don't believe, you go to hell (though he is never so blunt as to say it that way).His most useful message for me was simply that life needs to be purpose-driven. Humans need goals, focus and community support. His 'questions to consider' and 'points to ponder'were also useful topic to meditate over. But to me life doesn't have to be focused around my local church, as Warren insists.I admire Rick Warren for his community work and ability to impact positively on the lives of so many people. However, using this audiobook has not been a life altering experience for me."
2,"A wonderful book, with good advices but a sour tone","This is a truly wonderful book, filled with many good God-led advices. However, the tone is one of a constant criticism towards people, and what they DID NOT do, instead if helping and encouraging then. I have read quite a few books on the subject, and this is one that after reading half of it I got very upset and depressed about the overall tone.In any case, it is worth looking at, and learning from it."
3,Helful but basic,I thought the book was a good read overall but it just didn't provide the level of gut wrenching inspiration that I had anticipated.
5,better than any self-help book...bar none!,"Broken into 40 easy to digest chapters, you will witness the days fly by. There were times where I wanted to read on ahead, but Pastor Rick Warren discourages this because you need to do a bit of reflecting on what you've just read so you can apply it to your own life. Many many biblical references and scripture verses. Along with the book were wonderful verses to memorize. My favorite two: ""So in Christ, we who are many form one body and each member belongs to all the others"" and ""For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works which God prepared in advance for us to do."" Get in a small group & read it and discuss it together! It's very rewarding."
5,The Purpose Drive Life by Rick Warren,"Excellent book!! As a Christian I was at a time in my life where I knew I needed help and to lean on God, but I didnt know HOW to go about doing it. This book definately shed some light on my path.This book is thought and prayer provoking. It opens up your eyes to what it means to live as a Christian using thousands of verses in the bible. For me bible study was difficult and often times I did not understand what I was reading, but this book gave me insight and help walk me through the door of understanding so that it all made sense to me.If you are looking for answers inside of you and you know God is the way, but just not sure how to make a move-- then read this book! God Bless you!!"
5,Grow in your Church life,Info you can use in any religion. A way of life to guide you on your earthly pilgrimage.Good experience with vendor as well. Book arrived days before ETA.
3,Okay for those drawn to Christianity,"For people who find Christianity unattractive for whatever reasons, try The Reason Driven Life by Robert M Price---for a witty, clear, and, yes, reasonable approach to life that avoids claims based on revelation."
1,Purpose driven life for born agains,The title should properly read 'The Purpose Driven Life for Fundamentalist Christians' because that is who it is written for. Anyone hoping to discover some system for spiritual growth or understanding will be disappointed. The author's own understanding of God is of the 'Jesus wants you for a sunbeam' variety. Not very deep. And not for Hindus or any other religion. They presumably are going somewhere else.
1,not inspiring at all,"nothing new, full of dogmas, returned to the costco after 30 days. To finish reading REALLY needs effort."
1,Oh my God!,"Like some of the other reviewers I have read books about life's purpose. Edward Cayce, Nietche, Sylvia Browne and the series of books ""Conversations with God"" I was looking forward to more of this personal relationship with God material. What I got was a giant commercial for the church. It was downheartening to read that the church is the way to heaven and that one of the ways to make God smile is to socialize with other believers (christians). ""Other believers!!!!!"" I feel sorry for Mr. Warren if he really believes what he wrote. Don't wast your time or money on this bunk."
2,Really?,"This is just a repackaged edition of the same book. I read it 10 years ago and was not impressed with its religious overtones. That aside, where does Rick Warren come off calling this non-fiction? These writings are his opinion and nothing more. No thanks."
1,Confusing and belittling,"I tried with this book. I got the journal and made it through 10 days before I finally gave up. Between the self-righteousness of the tone and the mixed Biblical references, I very much felt that Warren developed his thesis and then went looking for the references, rather than the other way around.When he reaches back into the Old Testament for references as to what would please Christ, he really is mixing messages. For example, ""The Bible says, Figure out what will please Christ, and then do it."" Fortunately, the Bible gives us a clear example of a life that gives pleasure to God. The man's name was Noah."" (p. 69)Although Jesus came from the Jewish tradition, he challenged it as well. His great commandments speak of love. He drew on the Old Testament teachings but created a new way of looking at it.I didn't find my purpose in life from this book and I don't recommend it."
4,Worth the time and the $$$,"I was hesitant to read this. It's been around for years but it wasn't until I took a class in church that forced me to sit down and read the book.I'm glad I did. It reminds you of the things and people in your life that are really important. Family comes first for me and Christ is the head of my family. Hatred, and mean vindictive people have no place in my heart.Threats will not make me stand down. Bullying will only incite me and I will take a stand against the evil that attacks good people in the world because I have the strength and Christ at my side.Ultimately if you don't stand for anything in life, you will fall for anything. So I am taking a stand and I will not back down."
1,Utter garbage,"WHeeee!!! Here's another gimmick book for pastors who are envious of mega-churches and sick and tired of struggling with their small, poor congregations. You can also buy the Pupose driven mouse pad, coffee mug, keychain, and -let's see what's next? How about a line of purpose driven snack foods and sportswear? This is the same shallow, theology lite gospel that is reformulated every few years for the suckers. Hey, mega-churches may be doing something WRONG if they are so popular - churches that don't talk about law and judgment but just about grace and feeling good are always going to be popular.'Forget this trash. If you are too lazy to read the bible or a pastor who can't make the bible come alive you may not be saved and should get out of the church."
5,A real purpose,Rick Warren helps each person to focus on the real purpose of their life on this earth. It is so very simple...we only need to pay attention.
1,May I be blunt?,"This is the kind of thing that keeps so many people well away from organized religion. Honestly, do people really really _believe_ they are no more than puppets of some sort of God and that's what they're here for? That all their grief and all their triumphs and all their little moments of personal revelation are nothing more than God's Plan? Plan? As in, S/He has a plan? What? You mean like winning some damn game? Or seeing how many of her/his ""creations"" can get through a maze and not end up in Hell? Give me a break. This is sooo childish. GROW UP."
5,Inspiring,"This book is as fresh and new today as it was 10 years ago.I first read Rick Warren's fantastic book 10 years ago. I have since reread the 10 year anniversary edition. It features a few new chapters and a QR code at the start of each chapter linking a short inspirational video.I finished this book and had a warm feeling. I know I am loved by God and he is walking my life journey with me. Why am I here? is a question we all ask ourselves. Reading this book may help with the answer. It is 42 short chapters, designed to read a chapter a day.This book would make a great Christmas gift for family members! I have purchased several copies for my family."
5,Incredible book!,"This book has been truly remarkable in the life of myself, family, and many friends. Rick is very blunt, to the point, and honest about what it means to have a Purpose Driven life. I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever asked the question - What is the purpose of life?"
1,Worthless,"I bought this book hoping for some advice on making the difficult and important decision of ""what to do with my life"". Instead of anything useful or constructive, Warren offers the same answer for every situation: get into fellowship with like-minded Christians. The ""answers"" became so redundant that I couldn't even finish reading. If it's true that this is the best selling hardcover book ever, I'm very saddened by the state of western literacy."
3,Lost it's credibility with the onslaught of merchandise,"I have to admit that I was excited to read this book because it was so highly publicised and acclaimed - in actuality, that should have been my first red flag. I have to agree with some of the previous reviewers that while this book has a few pearls of wisdom, it has an overall preachy agenda that roused my suspicions. When I saw the slew of Purpose Driven Life ""accessories"" popping up here & there after the success of the book, I was downright irritated at the greed and commerialism of the product."
5,Life Changing Book,This book is so fantastic! I am reading w/ a friend as suggested by the author and it is a life changing experience. Needless to say I highly recommend this book.
1,The [insert trademarked term here] Life,"Far be it from me to take anything away from those who say that their lives have been enriched by this book. Spiritual growth can come in many forms and from many different sources.In my opinion, though, when someone registers a trademark on ""their"" system of enlightenment and publishes everything from a workbook to a DVD set on the topic -- well, let's just say I don't think that's the way Christ approached teaching. Seems like the author has a bit of an ego and is definitely looking out for the old bottom line."
2,Probably won't read it.,"This is not a true book review.I have heard so much good about ""The Purpose Driven Life,"" that when I saw it in a book store I leafed through it reading a few lines here and a few lines there. And I was very disappointed.Based on what little I read, it appears to be yet another Christian book domesticating God and letting middle class American Christians feel good about ourselves.It seems to be VERY shallow.I have a long list of books I'd like to read. ""The Purpose Driven Life"" is not on it."
1,What on earth is Rick Warren teaching?,"The Purpose Driven Life is a sad reflection of the current state of American Christianity. It has little in common with traditional Protestantism of either the mainline or evangelical variety.This is light reading. Basically it is a self-help book that uses Christian vocabulary to communicate a 40-day program of personal self-improvement. At best it is harmless. At worst people may mistake it for true Christianity.If you must read this book, then at least balance it with a thoughtful critique, such as ""More Than a Purpose"" by Marshall Davis or ""Reinventing Christianity"" by Bob DeWaay."
2,Be Careful - Read with a critical mind,One comment - be careful of how Rick Warren quotes scripture.1. He uses very liberal paraphrases and the original meaning is changed to fit the authors point.2. Only half the scripture is used or the scripture is used out of context to fit the authors point.
5,great book,Warren's book is life changing. It's full of thought provoking wisdom and provides much needed perspective. One of the best books I've ever read.
5,Purpose Driven Life,A wonderful book that helps me to understand just why I am here on earth. I use this book as a daily bible study. I have given this book as presents to many of my family and friends.
4,Unusual,"I usually run screaming from the room when self-help, religious, or ""inspirational"" reads are recommended by a friend. Usually I'm right. But in this case, and a few others, I was wrong. The Purpose Driven Life may not be the best book ever written, but it is full of some great ideas and elements that get the wheels turning. Certainly it's worth the price of admission. While it's not one of those fiction books that are inspirational, books like ""The Five People you Meet in Heaven"" or ""The Bark of the Dogwood,"" it is nevertheless a good read and I have to also recommend it. Just don't run screaming from the room on me."
4,Easy transaction,This book was given as a gift. The receipent said it was delivered promptly and in excellent condition.
1,The decline and fall of the church,"This book is for pastors who only are interested in money, power, large congregations and big tithes. Insipid pop rock Christian music and watered down gospel messages is what this book is about. Avoid at all costs!"
4,Feeling a little threatened are we???,After reading some of the negative reviews from the obvious ultra liberal anti-Christian readers I began to see what was happening. You all wanted to see what all the fuss was about and the message hit home a little too hard. Keep on doing your yoga and meditate to your Enya albums.
3,"LOVE the mangos, but not the price","I LOVE these mangos. I couldn't get enough of them last summer. I would order a case every month... but that's when the price was $30 for the case. For a couple of weeks, I was even able to get a case for $15! Then out of the blue, the price jumped to $50 and I gave up on them. And now, I came back to check to see the price has gone up to $55!!!! Are they kidding me? The mango pouches make great snacks, but the price is just ridiculous."
3,"Strange, but I got used to them","I found that if you mix them in a salad, they add a nice touch. Eating them by themselves is a bit like cardboard like everyone warned. I wouldn't buy them at ""full price"" ever, but maybe I'd get more it they were dumping them again."
3,Natural Dry Organic Mango,"That is exactly what I was looking for. It makes a good healthy snack. They are chewy and it takes a long time to finish the whole package, I think it should be packaged in smaller bags. My two year old grandaughter loves them and the deal is fantastic."
2,Bare Fruit is Barely Edible,I've tried LOTS of dried mangos - this has to be the worst. Tastes like slightly flavored cardboard. Definitely not an older child or adult snack.Since I purchased an entire case (stupid me) I'm going to try adding the mango pieces to various recipies. Maybe a mango chutney. Otherwise this was a total waste of money and is going in the trash.
4,MELLOW MUSIC,"Aahhhh this is just lovely piano...its hard to believe that it has Lakota Indian background. Also own their other one called Star People, thats got drums, flutes the works its beautiful."
3,"One outstanding track, the rest is okay","I got this because I love one track on it (Adiemus, 1999 version). I first heard it on a video showing a man soaring over Grand Canyon at sunset with a rocket back-pack, and the music was perfect for it. I also love, love, love Miriam Stockley's voice, which is clean, unwavering, flexible range of notes and style, and frankly very sexy. The other tracks are fine but (to my taste) not as distinctive or as good and directionally a bit more repetitive or boring (my opinion), but that's subjective. Sonically, it's a good CD, which is to say much better than (sigh) MP3, but not as good as the golden-ear media revered by audiophiles. I'm normal, so it's good.If you like this type of music and/or Adiemus, it's a good pick."
2,"No cross references, etc.","Have to disagree with most of the previous reviewers. In my opinion, the quality of versions of the NASB has been going down. In this one... no cross references, Jesus words not in red, and other issues. I love the NASB, but I miss the 1985 Cambridge Study Edition."
4,Great overall value,"I use the NASB for scripture memory and study so I picked this bible up when it was on sale a couple of years ago. Excellent value. I think that having a place to make notes as the Holy Spirit reveals them has truely transformed my understanding of the scriptures. The only drawback is that this bible does not have Christ's words in red, which I prefer. It also doesn't have cross-references, which is ok for me. Do yourself a favor and get the leather version. I admit that I'm hard on my bibles but I've had this hardback one for a few years and I can see that it's not going to last for the next 10 years (not a problem since I paid less than $20). I'm getting ready to spend some real $ on a new bible that will last. Why not. It's worth it, right!"
3,Zondervan backs product,I owned this Bible for less than two years before it started to fall apart. I went to Zondervan's website and got information on the warranty and then went through the proper steps and they sent me a brand new Bible for free without any hassles. I did not even need to pay postage. As a pastor I write a lot in my Bible and I wish the margins were even wider than they are. It would also be nice if it had cross references and a concordance. You do not know how much you will miss them until you do not have them.
5,A Notetaker's Bible,"Make sure and buy an XL Bible cover for this wonderful edition of the NASB. While I still refer to my cross reference Bible, this edition by Zondervan allows me all the ""elbow room"" I could ever want, germinating notes fit for a good Bible study. Also, this is one of the few Bibles that have not printed Jesus' words in distracting red ink! A must for pastors who still like to preach and teach the word, and not predigested, prepackaged ""sermons""."
1,the peg refills do not fit old lite bright models,"I ordered the peg refills thinking they had not changed over the years. My lite brite is an older model. I have absolutely no older pegs, they were lost in a move. Now I have oodles of activity sheets and still no pegs. Any help?"
3,"An interesting ""update.""","I have been following Hooper and his books since the first one appeared. I am a retired Spanish professor.This one is a good first step for someone who has not read the earlier studies. If you know the earlier editions, this one constitutes an update, not a complete revision.A ""GO"" for a first time buyer, not so much for someone familiar with the earlier works."
3,nice book,"Nice book, but not thhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat nice. Worth the money? Yes. But just so. And I'm spaniard, so believe in me!"
3,facts of drug index,"Sauder drug index is good informatory hand book specailly for nurces ,Explain indications very precisly and very important is that Drug index is not advertisment of different brands like other marketed books. This is very helpfull not only nurcses but also for doctors and pharmacist like me"
5,Jeter fans....,"fabulous book - great info, amazing photos. the only problem? I have to share it with my son, as i gave it as a gift to him. Jeter is spectacular, and this book is a must have for any true fan."
3,Product,"Product does not remove fine scratches. I followed the direction and went over the headlights 3 times and it still did not remove the scratches like the product said it would. The product made the headlights look cleaner and protected, but still did not remove the scratches and flaking of the outer coating."
3,"Burned Lenses, Includes Everything, Training Is Definately Needed","Everything you need is included in the kit. But not having done it before and not really used to operating power tools/buffers made it especially difficult. I seemed to have burned the plastic lens on the one headlight from using a high speed drill and put a gouge in my paint job when I slipped off the headlight with the drill because of the shape of my lenses. I did clear up the cloudiness somewhat, I just hope it lasts. But I can't fix the burned plastic on the one side. So I'm kinda disappointed, I fixed the issue but now have two new issues----burnt plastic lens (swirl marks), and a big scratch next to my headlight. So just be warned. Good Luck."
3,its functional,"i use it for work on lay out ,to plumb where its needed and easy to project measurements with confidence"
5,You got to have two brains!,"You have to have at least two brains to shoot. A cognitive thinking mind and a trigger brain. the trigger brain is much like the lizard brain and just lays there until you're up to your butt in aligators. This is definately a book of 'Brain Food' for both brains that you'll likely turn into a handy referance if you find yourself like me...your trigger brain remembers more than your cognitive brain. Don't be afraid to get them little marker thingies and mark the pages of importance! You won't remember all the ones that helped you!A well written easy to comprehend book for the most logger head of shooters. If Lou don't tighten your group, take up golf! If he helps, take up shooting golf balls!"
4,Slide-out mic could be a problem,"Overall, I really like this bluetooth speakerphone. But, I have had problems with the slide-out microphone not going back in after use. I actually had to open it up and glue the holding latch back in place twice now. A pain? Yes. But not too much to stop using it - the sound quality is the best I've used so far.**********Updated 6-28-2012I was correct in my initial review, the slide-out mic was a problem. It eventually broke and was unusable after that. I went to the Motorola TX-500 and couldn't be happier.Motorola TX500 Universal Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone - Black - Retail Packaging"
5,Best yet,Having purchased and tried 3 different devices this is the best yet. I have purchased it for my friends and family.
2,BlueAnt Light Pro's and Con's,"This product works well - the sound is crisp and it's extremely easy to use. Those are the positives. The problem is a flawed design in terms of the mic extended arm - which is also the on/off mechanism. I have had the product for just over a year, and use it infrequently, but the mechanism has ceased to catch/close. This means it can't be turned off, which means it needs constant charging. This is very disappointing. I can't recommend it given this problem was known to customer service, and other owners have experienced it too."
2,Functionality is good but magnets?,"The speaker phone is quite good - its performance is what you would expect but... powerful magnets to attach to a metal bracket on a portable product? Be careful throwing this little data killer into your briefcase - magnets and computer disks, credit cards and usb drives don't get along. May be a good way to attach to the bracket but not well thought out in my opinion."
2,BlueAnt Supertooth Light,"After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke. The retractable microphone,which also serves as a power switch,broke. The switch would no longer retract and the power would stay on. A simple on/off switch with a built in mircophone would be a more durable design."
2,Good but bad,"I bought 4 of these units for me, my wife and my parents ... We have had them for about 2 months and had issues with 2 of them - the SAME ISSUE with 2 of them. The On/Off / Microphone plunger is a poor design and on 2 of our units the plunger will not stay depressed. This means at least 3 things 1. The Blue Ant is always trying to answer my calls while in range, 2. It is ON all the time, 3. It constantly needs to be charges because I can't turn it off ... The supplier replaced one for us and I am going to approach him about the second one now (as it just happened). I am just not sure that I want another one ... 2 uits out of 4 broke within 2 months ...Oh, the good part (from my title) This is the best sounding blue tooth device I've ever used ..."
4,A definite keeper,This device is wonderful! I researched different handsfree devices for an affordable price and came across the BlueAnt. I was convinced by the reviews that this product seemed to be reliable and not just a waste of money. I got my BlueAnt in two days it was great! I charged it once and have been using it for over a month and it is still going strong! I've had no complaints of people not hearing me nor do I have any problems hearing them. So if you refuse to have something hanging from your ear 24/7 as I do...the BlueAnt is the product to get!
3,"Good By Day, Unusable at Night","Works fine in the daylight. Unusable at night since the nonstop, blinking blue light right at the edge of the driver's field of vision is so annoying. I assume the designers were stoned when they decided that would be a good idea."
2,Less then I had hoped for,I can here people who I speak to; however they have a very very hard time hearing me. This product does not keep back ground noise down AT ALL. It even picks up when they speak so they sometimes hear their own voice. It is strange. I would wait for a better product or until they improve this one. I was very disappointed.
5,BlueAnt Supertooth IS GREAT!!!!,"My husband purchased this product for me and I loved it so much that I purchased one for each of my two daughters and one for each of my son-in-laws. They immediately paired them up, put them in all of the cars and use them constantly. Thanks for such a great product."
5,"Great! Works exactly as advertised, sounds like it isn't there!","This is one item that is well worth the purchase price. I don't just use it in the car. It lets me drive -or do something else with my hands- while I talk on the phone, and it works wonderfully. People tell me I sound good, exactly like I do when just using my cell phone.I put the blue ant speakerphone on the visor and I put a plastic ""sticky pad"" on the dash. Now I just lay the cell phone where it gets the best signal.The magnetic back clip works very well, especially once I peeled off the clear plastic that covered the entire back of the speakerphone. Now it holds like glue. A great product that makes for safer driving."
4,This is a winner!,"I used to use a Plantronic 320 ear piece. When in my car, everyone I called could hear the road noise, the A/C blower, and static. The Blue Ant Supertooth was a quantum leap in clarity. No more ear discomfort, no more looking like a cyborg. Just clear sound. I also like the fact that I do not have to charge it every night. And for less than $100, it is a steal."
1,I'm very disappointed!,"I bought this product because I was tired of the head set wireless ear devise, and I thought this Blueant speakerphone was a good option, but went I started using it the people I called could not understand me very well, My voice cut off every single worth I said, it's been 2 months since I bought it I don't know if I can return it back. I just don't use it anymore. I'm very disappointed!"
2,Flawed design,"I bought one of these in Nov 2008 and was extremely happy with it until Jan 2009 when the mic boom stopped working properly. The boom wouldn't stay stored any more so the unit was always on... The batteries would run out and if we were close to the car we were connected to the BlueAnt. We got a replacement under warranty but in June 2009 the same thing happened to the replacement. I've taken the unit apart and it's a spring and catch arrangement inside that keeps the boom in place. Problem is that the catch is plastic and small, so after a while it wears away and no longer works. It's not replaceable.Shame, because otherwise the BlueAnt is a wonderful device."
4,"High quality, but seems to amplify some wind sound while car is driving","High quality, reasonable price, but seems to amplify some wind sound while car is driving.Windows aer all closed, and there is no wind is inside the car, but still - the persons on the other side seem to hear a wind whisper while I'm using this speaker (hanging near the mirror)."
3,Good sound - reliable?,"I like the way this works and it sounds good.But less than a month into operation, the retractable microphone (which turns the unit off and on) will no longer retract. This means the unit is on all the time, which means I have to charge it every night. That's a pain. Also, it automatically answers calls when I'm in the truck ... and sometimes I don't want to talk!"
4,Hands Free that works,I love the Ant. I get clear reception and I am heard on the other side. I love that I am not walking around with a headset. I have it mounted on the visor. It hold a charge for days and was extremely easy to install. I will be making this purchase again at Christmas.
3,BlueAnt Supertooth Light Handsfree Speakerphone,The positive: Sound quality is excellent. No highway noise detected-even the radio is not an interference. Easy link to phones.Charge time good enough.The negative: Going back to the manual for call management refresher-again. Disconnected an important call when answering. Want total ease of use on an L.A. Freeway.
1,Blue ant super tooth,"This is a great handfrees device, we bought three for our company trucks and locomotives and they work great, good clear sound and when talking the person on the other end say the sound is very clear, great battery life and simple to use"
5,Its a must have.,"Palmers cocoa butter is the best for lips. Because I work on the phone's all day at the clinic,my lips dry up But when I put on the Palmers my lips are soft and feel beautiful once again. I love it and can't live with out this cocoa butter. You have to try it yourself and you'll see."
4,It was good and pointed out a sad part of our history,Nicole Macy: It was a good book about a young girl who was put in a concentration camp for Japenese Americans.
2,Interesting- but mostly boring!,"I am just 11, but I love to read, and there are few books I don't get through. When I started reading this, it went nowhere. It just stayed very boring the whole time. Yes, I did enjoy learning about it, but overall, I really didn't enjoy this book. I'm not much of a biography person, so maybe someone who enjoys biographies would like this better. I was very surprised to see that many people gave it 4 or 5 stars."
3,Looking for something more...,"Guess I am cynical. I just got through writing a review of Finch's welding manual and I still don't have anything great to say about the Haynes Manual.The Haynes manual is probably better than the Finch book. It gets into a little more detail with the processes and provides useful insight into thing. Shows defective welds etc.Again, I'd recommend going to one of the welder manufacturer sites like Hobart, Miller or Lincoln and buying a learning set on the process you want to master."
2,Cute but not practical!,The elmo's world books are cute but they have flaps on every page that my kids tore off in two seconds. This is a book you can't leave them to enjoy on their own if you don't want it destroyed. I would not recommend this book for that reason.
5,Quite Simply......,"The very best black tea there is! I agree that there are a few good black teas, but if consistency and a deep, rich, delicious quality in a tea are attributes you desire, then you must consume Yorkshire Gold. I have enjoyed this tea for many, many years, and recommend it highly. Brian"
4,jolson be[ng jolson,so many of jolson's early movies just seemed to be jolson playing himself. It was as if we are watching his stage shows. He was even called Al in many of them. They must have been afraid he would forget who he was.
5,Good Tool But,I recently purchased this tool from Amizon.com but there is one problem. You can not purchase the metal cutting wheel. this was the only reason I made the Purchase. Now I have a Problem.
2,dc410,this tool heats batteries up and wears them out and the wheels have to be replaced quite frequently. also sucks metal into the motor the renders it useless.
5,Excellent option for convenience and portability,"As noted by other reviewers, the DeWalt DC410 18-volt cordless cut-off/grinder tool is not well-suited to production environments or other applications where extensive grinding or a large number of cuts are required. But for the average user who needs a handy angle grinder for small jobs, this unit is a viable alternative to the traditional corded tool, and is much more convenient to carry to wherever the work may be. With 18 volts of power on tap, this tool makes short work of grinding aluminum or mild steel, and with a readily available cutting wheel, it chews through padlock shackles, rebar, chain links and the like in just seconds. The DC410KA is a worthy addition to the arsenal of any serious DIY homeowner or tradesman."
2,here we go again,"Another rehash of the ""priest-who-finds-document-which-will-change-the world"" theme. Some of it was interesting, but the ending when an unearthed document has Christ speaking the most politically correct utterances ever...well, it was too much! Can someone write something original about ""unearthed documents""?"
1,Such a mess...,"The author is totally ignorant of majority of the things he writes about. His view of war in Bosnia is so one-sided and really insulting for the people who lived that war in real life. His research for the book is really minor, because his Croats bear Muslim and Serb names (and vice versa). Other thing, the Kosovo crisis - why did he put it in there, wasn't the war in Bosnia enough?? (I guess he needed 40-something pages to fill). I live on the territory of former Yugoslavia, and I was disgusted that once again the miseries of Balkan people are used as a backdrop for some wannabe priest-soldier-Indiana Jones escapades."
4,Packaging,I just recieved my order and I have to say that I think they could be boxed better. I did not have any major damage just scuffs here and there on some of the handles and i am still awaiting my free rack.
1,"Hmmm, Crap This Is...Good book, this is not.","YAAWWWN..Oh man this boring! Based on the title and the cover art, I decided to buy this. I bought the audio version on CD because I thought it would be something exciting to listen to in the car. Unfortunately, the advertising was misleading and I found book has very little to do with Vader, his rise to power or any major events within the Empire. Instead the book is about 90% focused on some Jedi named Roan Shryne and his Padawan named Olee Starstone. It is filled with long winded, drawn out descriptions and week dialog (once I heard a character say ""what the frizz"", I hit the skip button on the CD player). There really were no exciting ship battles, lightsaber duels, or the usual things that make Star Wars fun. Also, I was hoping for juicy dialog between Vader and the Emperor. There are some conversations between them, but they are few and far between and never really develop into anything or lead anywhere. This was a big opportunity wasted."
1,Major disappointment,"There are several problems with this book beginning with the sad fact that there is no real story, just a loosely woven collection of vignettes featuring a collection of minor characters that are best forgotten. Vader never develops as a result of any of the events depicted between this book's covers, although the author claims that Vader makes a major breakthrough in understanding the darkside. Unfortunately, we're never shown why, how, or what that possibly means.Secondly, the book is populated with minor characters (Vader isn't introduced until nearly page 50) that are really nothing more than fodder for the Dark Lord, characters that are stood up only so they can be knocked down. Except for their names, they are indistinguishable.Which speaks to the major shortcoming of this book, the very poor writing. I was never once ""drawn"" into any of the scenes or the lives of the characters. The writing was flat, the characters d.o.a., and the story missing in action."
1,the story does not match the title,"I feel the story should've dealt more with the title character, rathter than the title character being more a 2nd tier player in all of this.The story dealt more with the fleeing Jedi, their thoughts, motivations, fears, etc, rather than the Emperor's new apprentice.For my first Star Wars novel, I'm very disappointed, and unsure if I'll read further."
1,bad book,"This was the second worst star Wars novel I have ever read, the only one worse was the Courtship of Princess Leia."
4,Great story,"Unlike many of the other Star Wars titles, I really enjoyed this book. I felt that the author did a great job at keeping continuity in the story line with the movies unlike many of the other authors that attempt to write further stories.What I liked most about this book was reading how the Empire transitions the galaxy to their rule without showing it's true evil side... yet. I hope that this author will continue his story."
2,Ti'ng anh to ti'ng viet only!,"Returned this item. It is only an English to Vietnamese dictionary, not both ways.Will buy the Langenscheidt Vietnamese Universal Dictionary as soon as it's released. Seemed fine for what it was though."
3,"Disc is great, but...","Disc was in perfect shape, but the jewel case was from a blank CD/CDR... Really wish it had been the original case..Three stars."
5,Very cool - Cooler Master,"For the same reason Porsche, Volkswagen, Honda & Harley, all have migrated from air to liquid cooling, so have computers. I have tried many of the top rated massive copper heat sink/fan combinations available and the Aquagate Mini R120 out performs them all.I installed my R120 to draw through the radiator and then expel the hot air from the computer case which is by far the most efficient way to deal with heat buildup. So far my CPU has maintained just a few degrees above ambient room temperature and is far quieter than the previous ""turbo"" dual fan installation. The only downside to this unit is the cost and the installation. I have an AMD 64 3500 and it required a little ingenuity to cut the case for the blow hole and mount the radiator, pump and fan.Other than that I am very pleased, and highly recommend this unit over all the other products I have tried before."
2,Very disappointed,"Ordered two of these trays and got them in today. I searched everywhere for trays that hold 24 eggs and then I finally found this one! Imagine my disappointment when I opened the box and guess what? There are only 15 slots for eggs. Now maybe they use a different counting system than I do...I'm not sure. Even if I cram eggs in the center where garnish or dip is supposed to go, there is no way you can cram 9 eggs in that small area. And to add insult to injury, the lid has one of those great big stickers in the middle that is attached with super glue (you know, the kind that no matter what you try, you always have that gluey, sticky residue on it, and if you scrub it off, you have scratches all over the plastic.) I definitely would not waste my money on this."
5,A Very Practical Introduction to Design of Experiments(DOE),"This book was recommended to me by a quality manager of long experience and it was a very good recommendation. Having aquired an engineering degree before DOE became very widespread, I have largely had to educate myself in DOE methodology. ""Designing for Quality"" is written in plain language and has easy to understand directions and tables to use both in designing your experiments and analysing the resulting data. With this book, I planned, conducted and analysed data from several experiments before I ever had the assistance of a knowlegable practitioner of DOE. When I gained such assistance, I had my results and conclusions from these experiments confirmed. I am now Quality Manager for a plant of 650 employees and when I need to teach DOE, whether to an experienced engineer or a novice technician, ""Designing for Quality"" is the text I always use."
3,Just doesn't cut it,"Well to start off, I have to say this movie had a really good beginning. Characters were good and settings were ok, even had a good ending. However, about half way into the movie, it kind'a fell apart. It turned into a low grade slasher flick, and I don't just mean gory, so it was a little disappointing. What was also disappointing was Michael Ironside was hardly in it. I'd say it was more of a cameo.Also, ignore the product description above. After having seen the movie, I have no idea how they came up with that description. It makes it sound like it might be a zombie flick or something, so if that's what you're looking for, your way off. It should read more like ""5 Teens on their way to a party get stranded at a deserted motel in the middle of nowhere. One by one they start to disappear, and must discover what is stocking them before it's to late.""Because it had a decent beginning and end, I had to give it at least 3 stars for effort."
1,1 star too many,I had no problem putting this book down--constantly. I finally finished it and wished I'd spent the time watching TV or sleeping.
2,a long drawn out what if,"the story started out with a good introduction then develops the story-line with a fair amount of action, mystery. My opinion, it then stalls and just kind of lingers around what you know is coming next, but it never seems to get there. This is why I gave it only two stars.. The ending seemed lacking in substance although there is a great deal of curiosity developed around two characters. I was hoping all the way through it was going to come to life? It just didn't seem to reach out and really pull me in the way I was hoping it would. It got my interest, held it enough so that I read the entire book, and then left me unsatisfied. lolllllll"
4,"""Very cool military/paranormal adventure""","Donegan did a great job tying together some of Earth's biggest mysteries into a cool sci-fi story. History buff that I am, I really liked how he worked Flight 19 and the USS Scorpion disappearance into the book. Pretty good action scenes. Did a great job handling the survey crew on the downed plane in Cambodia. Ariana Michelet came off as a take charge woman focused on getting her crew out alive despite the strange goings on around them. Former Green Beret Dane seemed pretty stone cold, but given what he'd been through with his earlier journey into the mysterious Angkor Kol Ker section of Cambodia, it was understandable and worked well in the story. And what a secret this guy has! Also, the Shadow was a unique race of alien invaders. Very imaginative."
1,returned after 2 chapters,"this is a simplistic unintelligent book-like lets not cross the river i have a bad feeling but they cross and you know what happens ,machines come from nowhwhere and chew them up -also -HOW LOW can you go-the comment on the front of the book is from robert dougherty-thats the same person as the author of this book-written under a another name-he praises his own book-how low"
4,An excellent thriller with a beautiful twist ...,"This is an excellent book by Greg Donegan. I picked it up simply because it presented an interesting twist to the age-old ""Atlantis"" and ""Bermuda Triangle"" mysteries. The author weaves an intricate web of adventure and mayhem entangled with very believable sci-fi. From start to finish there is an incredible pace to the book. The main plot is very intriguing and it is really hard to put the book down. Simply because of the unique nature of the plot and the good finish it is a MUST READ! The only thing that begs a question is, ""When is the sequel coming out?"""
3,Mediocre at best,"This is my first review for a Kindle ebook....I always read customer reviews in order to help me make my decisions. I hope this review is helpful. I enjoy all genres of literature and have been on a bit of a scifi kick. This novel had potential to be very interesting and suspenseful, but sadly fell quite short. It left many unanswered questions and lacked much detail in character depth/detail and plot. When I finished the novel, I was left wondering...will there be a sequel? If so, will it answer the questions that the original did not? In my opinion, Atlantis left the reader asking...""Who"", ""What"" and ""Why""?"
3,"Fun read, but major tech gaffes","Overall it was good read. Fast paced adventure story. Lots of fun. But technical gaffes were more than a little distracting. Authors attempt to explain a lot of the technology in the story and they clearly don't understand it. Two glaring issues that I found very distracting were GPS technology and satellite orbital mechanics. Bad guys used signal to GPS satellite to hide stuff, but GPS satellites don't receive any signals from users, they only broadcast. There were other errors in description of how GPS works, but that was the worst. On the orbital mechanics issue, the book has a spy satellite at 150 mile altitude stop over a spot on the Earth, which violates some laws of physics. Then it has the satellite do something at least as impossible later on. If I didn't have a basic understanding of physics I could have probably ignored these and just gotten into the fun of the storytelling, but authors made too big a point of trying to explain these things."
3,Enjoyable,"I am having a tough time rating this one. Probably somewhere like a 3.5.I almost tossed in the towel on it but didnt, and in the end Im glad I read it. It had a good start, then dragged, but finally got rolling. I agree witha few comments that the ending felt weak, like the author wasnt sure where to go with it. Still, for $.99 its a very good book & was strong enough to entice me to try another in the series (I think its a series).I liked the characters, they were well developed, the setting was described quite well and at times reminded me of The Mist, by Stephen King.Give it a try."
4,New twist on an old story,Interesting take on the bermuda triangle. With modern day heros. Story takes place in two time periods. Vietnam war and the present. A group is taken into the depths of atlantis/bermuda triangle in search of who knows what only to be attacked by who knows what. Women in lead postions of power and the wealthy thinking that money can buy you anything make for the action and drama in this story. A little sci-fi mixed with military fiction. Interesting part one of a to be continued tale.
3,Exciting but frustrating,"Great plot lines, terrific detail, exciting adventures. Story could use a little more character development however.Big caveat: WHO EDITED THIS? Just using spellcheck is not enough. Fix the basic grammar and homophone mistakes! Sloppy work from the publisher occurs throughout the book. If the author can take time to research the military details, the publisher should make time to fix simple editorial mistakes. It takes makes getting lost in the adventure a little difficult when startled out of it by mistakes every few pages."
3,good page turner,"A fast, entertaining read and worth the price at 99 cents. Bought the Kindle version and found the presence of many proofreading errors to be distracting. Mostly missing words here and there and a few times the wrong word. Perhaps Amazon or the publisher can address this."
5,Great resource!,This book provides valuable information about the interactive authoring process that is independant of specific authoring tools. The content is presented in a logical manner that is relevant and easy to follow. I recommend this book to all of my students!
5,An Important Book!,"The failure of the publisher soon after this book was published is really a shame as it should have had a much bigger impact. Blakeslee's ideas are clearly presented and can make a major difference in your life by helping you to better understand the distortions that result from a faulty self-concept. Unfortunatly, the self-concept we are taught by our society totally ignores the thinking going on in all parts of our mind other than the verbal self-control part of your mind. A large section on mental illusions shows some of the bizzare lengths we go to to preserve this false concept of a self always in control.It's really a shame that this book is no longer in print as used copies are selling for as much as $250 in the used market."
2,AutoLoc Kl1800 18 Function Keyless W/Birt,"The product came well boxed on the packing. The Product in the Box was not in good shape. Product Box was broken and the Product was Dusty like parts sitting on a Dusty Shelf.Product still worked on all aspects, but this was not the AutoLoc 18 Function Keyless with ""Birt"".There was nothing about the ""Birt"" Feature on the Product Box or the papers in the Product Box.The Product still works, but dissapointed that does not have ""Birt Feature"".ThanksBernard"
1,One Star because There Is Not An Option For Zero,"Terrible, horrible no good read. The plot, charachters, and story development stunk. I would recommend sitting in traffic instead of reading this book."
1,not worth it,"I was so excited waiting for this to arrive. Once i received it i felt ripped off. it looked very cheap, did not shine at all, and it was an odd layout. The center piece was bevelled and raised too far out. The side view looked tacky to me. The ""diamond"" accents looked like flecks of tinfoil. I returned it for a full refund."
1,Horrible Conclusion to a Great Series,"This book was a huge letdown and a horrible way to end a great series. The first two books focused primarily on the Tuigan. In Crusade they were almost an afterthought. After winning battle after battle the first two books, suddenly they lose control of basic strategy.The major problem with the book is that the first two thirds of the book are about King Azoun getting ready for the crusade. The Tuigan (and any form of action)doesn't even make an appearance until the last third of the book.I've read this series several times over the years, but I always hate to pick up this last book, because it's more of a melodrama than a fantasy book."
4,A good book for managers,"I am continuously using this book to improve the productivity and quality in my company.As a manager in the software area, this book is a must.Every time I read the book, I find something new to change in the company."
1,Arrived damaged & defective,"The title says it all. Arrived in a flimsy box which obviously didn't protect it from getting banged up during shipping. The face is way off-center, which doesn't allow the blades to move/circle properly, or sometimes at all. Am waiting until I get some power tools to take off the screws holding the frame together to see if I can reset the face & blades. I'm sure if I can ever fix the alignment it will be a great fan. But for now, pretty much useless."
2,First order defective ...,"I was researching the best fan to replace one that abruptly stopped working last week and was excited to have stumbled upon this fan. I paid extra for one day shipping only to receive a defective fan. From reading other reviews, this is hopefully a fluke. Unless the fan is operating on high, the fan emits an extremely annoying clicking and high pitched squeal. However, the fan does push out a lot of air and can be felt across the room. In conclusion I am awaiting a replacement and will update this review upon receiving the second fan."
1,Very Disappointed,"I ordered a dashmat for my father for Christmas for a '92 Chevy Blazer. I was sent the wrong one. Turns out it is too small and made for a S10 blazer. I am very disappointed because I ordered this same product last year and the SAME EXACT THING HAPPENED. I was unable to return and purchase a new one before the holiday, but thought I'd try again this year. I will NOT be buying again and will be returning the current one...again. Waste of time."
1,Don't waste your money on this products,"After using this product along with Janson Beckett's Cleansing Milk, toner, Skin Prep, Okusil, Vitamin C&C and DermaExcel for 4 months, all I have seen is more pronounced wrinkles and older looking skin. I'm 32-years-old. Growing in a tropical island accelerated the aging of my face, but I think that I still can repair it. Definitively not with these products. If I can post pictures of the bottles and my skin somewhere I'll do it..."
5,"Beautiful, accessible introduction to an exquisite artform","Stuart Cary Welch is an art historian (I think he taught at Harvard, but I'm not sure) who loves his work, and it clearly shows in this volume. The pictures are exquisite, the reproductions are beautiful, but the best part is the commentary: his only goal is to make the work -- and the stories the pictures tell, for they are all essentially book illustrations -- as much a pleasure to the audience as it was to him. He could not wear his learning more lightly nor with more enthusism, and yet it is clear he must know everything there is to know about this culture. Right after you get this, you'll immediately go right back to Amazon to get a copy of the Shah-Nama, the marvelous epic Iranian poem that so many of the splendid miniatures in this volume illustrate."
4,Good entertainment but no surprises,"Martins The Hedgeknight offers good entertainment but no real surprises. The artwork is great, though, and as a Martin-fan, I look forward when no. 2 is comming this fall."
2,Disappointed.,"I love George R R Martin, and am in awe of the Fantasy series for which this was billed as a prequel. I was expecting more substance. His novels are brilliant with complex plots and characters. The characters are not developed. And I didn't realize this was a comic book. And it just sorted of stopped. It never really came to any conclusion. Really disappointing."
4,Guyot Designs Lg Utensil Set,"I purchased this set to use with freeze dried meal pouches and freezer bags when using a bag cozy. I have not had the chance to take them on an extended hike yet but in the short term they have worked out well. I like the seperate spatula/knife/spreader which gives me the option of leaving it at home to cut a few oz when it is not needed. On the down side so far, I wish it was less ridgid, more flexable. I will try to update this review after I have had it on the trail for an extended period of time."
5,Floor/Standing Yoga DVD Fits Busy Lifestyle,I have found John Schlorholtz's Floor & Standing Yoga DVD's to be an excellent form of exercise and flexibility training. The way he has organized the DVD's--with many options for types and lengths of routines--makes if very easy to work the routines into a busy lifestyle. I don't know of any Yoga video that has quite the flexibility and options that this one has.
2,Very disappointing,I am baffled over the rave reviews of this DVD set. I purchased the set as I teach several different types of yoga classes and wanted to observe some techniques for teaching a chair/standing class. This set is horrible. The instructor's teaching technique is so poor I had a hard time watching the entire program.
4,Solid Book,"I decided to read this book after having read 'America's Prisoner: The Memoirs of Manuel Noriega"", which I really enjoyed reading. This is a decent to good book overall with some high points. I really had no idea about this story at all until reading the previously mentioned book, and after reading that, decided to read a book by an independant source. Shooting the Moon is very intreging story, and seems like something that could not possibly happen. The writer is very in depth in his story telling, and you really feel like you are getting an education not only on the events surrounding Noriega, but also the time period in America as a whole. My one complaint about the book is the style of writing, it is not smooth, and is not a 'fun' read. Overall I really enjoyed the book, but felt that the writing could have been worked on a bit to make the read more appealing."
3,They have not fixed glue problem - read before buying or opening package!,"This was received in quick order as is usual with Amazon. I thought perhaps Dewalt had fixed the glue problem on these but they have not. The base fell off of the frame right out of the box and the nuts which are captured underneath it went all over the place. Luckily I was able to find all of them and replace.To glue the base back on I used Liquid Nails Perfect Glue. This is bit messy but has worked so far. After you let it dry a few minutes, clean the base off with mineral spirits and it will clean right up.After a day to cure, I attached my sander, made a few adjustments and began sanding a 42"" x 80"" table top. It works well for this purpose.This item has been available for several years...shame on DeWalt for not fixing this glue problem. I have always been satisfied with DeWalt products before."
5,Pretty Little Cat!,"I love cats, especially female tabbies. Mog looks so much like my parents' female cat. Her pose on the cover looks exactly as our cat looks. A great throwback to my childhood. This is a story about a cute, friendly, gentle cat named Mog, who is loved by her family (the Thomases), but also tends to get in the way. She eats Nicky's breakfast, for example. However, the Thomas' love for her is always shown afterwards. When she plays the unplanned role of heroine (stopping a burglar in his tracks), the Thomases realize fully just how important Mog is to the family."
5,Fantastic books exactly as I ordered thankyou.,i go by looking at an item and by looking at the iterm I can givea a rating and my rating is positive.feedback
5,We love Mog!,"Typical Judith Kerr! An excellent book for children, simple yet exciting. Would recommend to all parents who read bedtime books!"
2,drat that publisher!,"This was my favorite book as a child. I was excited to read it to my children, but this book was censored, removing the word ""drat"". Just not the same now."
5,Great buying experience,"Received the order quickly, no problems, and item was just as I expected. It's a great story and I bought it because it was a childhood favorite."
1,Not a skeptic,"This is not a Skeptics approach, it is based on faulty logic and does not use any of the tools of skepticism. The author may have been a cinic or an unbeliever, but should not have lied about being a skeptic."
2,Brings one question to mind,"If you are an evolutionist, then this book might spring some questions about evolution to your mind. It brings up some good points about the chances of life springing from nothing. However, after reading (The Blind Watchmaker), or any other evolution book, you will realize how dishonest, and misunderstood the points made in this book are. The idea in the blind watchmaker are that their was no specific aim, or idea for life, and that it just happened. This tears down the idea that there is some 1 in two trillion chance or so of life taking form. It also fails to throughly get into the fossil records, and purposely glides past any strong evidence for evolution. It seems this book just picks out the small flaws in evolution and skeptic beliefs, and fails to reveal all of the many flaws in religious belief. This book is quite deceptive as written by another reviewer."
1,"Better titled: ""A Believer's Search for God""","I must agree with the reviwers (iconoclast 666 particularly) that this book contains many scientific inaccuracies, omissions, and selectivly slanted misrepresentations of current scientific knowledge. Not to mention that a vast majority of the ""scientific ideas"" are really ""straw man"" arguments that are so watered down (or just plain misrepresented) that they become easy targets to those predisposed to attack them. I can only imagine this book would be persuasive to someone without a background in biological science. Do youself a favor and skip this one. A much better and more thoughtful read can be found elsewhere (I would suggest Richard Dawkins or Carl Sagan of course, but Gary Marcus's new book The Birth of the Mind is also spectacular not only in its new ideas, but in its summary of current biological science---something the ""Search for God"" sorely needs)."
5,Buying another Jane Brody,"I'm a huge Jane Brody fan. Over the past 10 years, I've bought several copies of ""Good Food"" and ""Good Food Gourmet."" I've worn out a few of my own copies and have found it the perfect gift for those I care about. Because of Ms. Brody's dedication to healthy eating and use of diverse foods, I have kids that eat vegetables and people that are always asking for the recipe. If you are looking to learn how to cook, eat better, or feel better, I couldn't think of a better book to suggest. Today, I am ordering a copy of the Good Food Book for my sister-in-law for Christmas. She loved the sweet and sour cabbage rolls I made at a recent party."
1,Gutless,Do yourself a favor pass on this one. Drains a fully charged battery in about two minutes Suction is a joke.Hope to get $5.00 for it at my next garage sale. Bought a small ridged almost the same size 5 hp 25 ft cord for $50 at HD
2,"You call this a vacuum?? It will not pick up much on carpet, works ok on hardwood floors...","I bought this for my wife for Christmas after searching for many vacs... The suction is near useless unless youhave only hardwood floors, it will not work on any type of carpet..."
4,Exactly What I Expected/Wanted,"This vacuum was exactly what I wanted/needed. I was almost put off from buying it by the negative reviews, but I'm glad I did buy it. Here's what I use it for:a) Pellet stove ashes (cool ones obviously, make sure you clean the fliter every time)b) It easily hooks to my Dewalt orbital sander for dust (wood and sheetrock).c) Quick pick-ups around the house.d) Quick clean of the car.e) Light to medium pick-ups in smaller and harder to reach areas.I use a lithium ion battery and it lasts a while (10 minutes of constant running is a long time for a vacuum).Here's what it's not good for:a) Heavy-duty jobs that you would normally use a standard size shop-vac for.b) ""Thorough"" cleaning of the carpets in your car (if you haven't cleaned the car all winter, you're beyond what this will do for you :)c) Long-running battery jobs (unless you have a lot of charged batteries)."
3,NO CHARGER,THIS UNIT WORKS WELL BUT IT DOES NOT HAVE A BUILT IN CHARGER. SEEMS LIKE DEWALT SHOULD HAVE DONE THERE HOME WORK AND PUT A CHARGER IN THE UNIT. REAL SIMPLE IDEA. IM TAKING IT BACK TO LOWES.!!!!!!!!! NO MORE DEWALT........
1,CORDLESS VAC??????,"I'M DISAPPOINTED IN MY VAC, IT SAYS CORDLESS, BUT DID NOT COME WITH BATTERY BACK-UP, DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD TO ORDER THAT EXTRA.CORDLESS TOOLS SHOULD ALWAY COME WITH A BATTERY, THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT CORDLESS!"
2,"Difficult to empty, low suction","The design makes it difficult to empty, odd shape and the lip on the inside of the tank catch dust and debri while you're trying to empty. Suction is marginal."
2,TK Testifies,"This tool was refurbished, the hinge was broke and canister wouldn't seal, I ordered a new hinge from dewalt and tool isn't cracked up to my exceptions, wouldn't recomend this one, doesn't suck well at all"
3,DeWalt battery vacuum,"I purchased the DeWalt cordless vacuum because I have been satisfied with my DeWalt cordless construction tools. The tools (drills, reciprocating saw, cordless circular saw, hammer drill and impact drivers) have operated well and lasted quite a long time. The vacuum is a little anemic in the suction department and moving the wand over rubber particles in the race car moves them around quite efficiently but leaves them in the same general area. DeWalt needs to do some work here."
2,"On the other hand, there's Duffin.","Readers of this book would be well served by also reading Ross Duffin's ""How Equal Temperament Ruined Harmony (And Why You Should Care)"". It covers most of Isaacson's ""blind spots"" and, as the title suggests, takes quite a different view of the subject. Duffin has a great mastery of the historical evidence and writes in a very accessible style--no heavy mathematics needed, though some elementary musical knowledge would be helpful."
1,Pretentious Rubbish !,"I saw an interesting review of this book in the Economist Magazine so I bought it from Amazon. It has been a long time since I have been so thoroughly disappointed in any book purchase - on any subject. This is an annoying ramble through historical mysticism which has little to do with the subject matter, thought to be the tuning of keyboard instruments. It pretends to be erudite but shows its writer as a dabbler and ends up being thoroughly boring and irrelevant. Of little use to any music lover or any musician."
3,OK read,McCullough knows his topics but tends to be overpowered by minutia. It was too in-depth for me. After about two thirds of the book I put it away.
4,"Friends told me it was a really interesting read, but...","I will have to submit a review later because I haven't read it yet. It arrived too late to reead it for the study group I'm a member of, so I set it aside for later."
3,Not sure what to think,"The Johnstown Flood was a very well-written novel, but I felt that some parts dragged. McCullough definitely did weave a nice story but parts could have been left out. It was very hard for me to get through the first 100 or so pages."
3,AN OKAY Book,"It takes a long time, with some irrelevant facts, to get to the actual problems with the dam, the fishing club, and the members of the town. Bottom line: It was a disaster the could've been avoided. I am sure a quick encyclopedia article would do just fine for anyone looking for data on this topic. Sorry! The Boorklyn Bridge Book was GREAT!"
1,Kindle pricing.,"Why is the Kindle version of this book more expensive than the ""real thing""? The Kindle version isn't even as complete, apparently."
5,Another great McCullough story,"David McCullough tells a compelling story of this tragic event. As always, he does a thorough job and gets behind just the basics of the story he is telling. It is a wonderful presentation of history."
5,The Johnstown Flood,This book was very interesting especially to me because my ancestors lived in Johnstown in the early 1900's. It was very detailed & graffic. I highly recomend it.
1,Absolute Non sense,"Absolute Nonsense in the book. If you are in a position of IT Manager then you dont need this book. Its better for a non IT person. For an IT pro, its nothing but absolute nonsense. Reading this book doesnt enhance any of your knowledge skills. Mere waste of money.....I wasted too !!!"
1,DW433 3X21 review,"I have owned this belt sander for a number of years, but I don't use it much because I have a 6"" DeWalt Random Orbit sander that I really like to use. Consequently I only use the belt sander for certain jobs. I had trouble with the tracking from the beginning. The sander ripped belts. I took it to a DeWalt Service Center soon after I bought it. When I used it a week ago. I got it tracked but when I started using it the tracking changed and I ruined two belts. Since then I am careful to continue adjusting the tracking while it is under load (while sanding with it) to reach a point where it tracks. The problem is that you are always watching the belt edge to make sure it's OK. I am not satisfied with this situation and I don't understand why tracking is such a problem with this sander. The one I owned before the DeWalt didn't give me a problem."
1,"A 3 pack, not a 12 pack","These are great concrete hangars - they install with virtually zero effort - but I received 3 of them, not 12."
5,Spectacular,"If you love the Stereophonics and if you love live music, then this is the album you've been waiting for. I bought it the day it came out and I haven't listened to anything else since. The whole thing, both discs, are great. They may have done a better job mixing the album, but it's a great live performance. I love Language, Sex, Violence, Other?, and this live album showcases the other. Great renditions of Dakota, Superman, and Devil are included here. But the best of the band comes out on their earlier stuff. A Thousand Trees blows the roof out of the stadium and the crowd just goes wild. I also really enjoyed their b-side Carrot Cake and Wine and their new song Jayne. But if I had to pick a highlight, it would be the stellar acoustic version of Maybe Tomorrow. All in all, Magnificent!"
2,Sizes are off,These helmets are way too small for the sizing. Had to send back without using so can't comment on quality.
5,Nice Design + Cheap + Solid,Broke my jaw mountain biking about a year ago so needed to get me a full face. This was about the cheapest helmet I could find and I has held up well. Plus it looks pretty legit. No complaints here.
1,Piece of junk,"I received this guitar today. It is a piece of crap! I don't understand how it got 5 stars. I am trying to return it, but the seller (countlesspages) does not seem to provide a return option."
5,Really Absorbing Manga,I find this Manga series one of the most absorbing I've ever read. It is very interesting and enjoyable. I am a teacher and will allow this series in my classroom. They will love it too!
4,X-23/NYX HC:My entrance into X-Men lore,"This is my first ""X-Men"" title, and was a great way into the X-Men Universe. ""X"" doesn't have as deep a history as a lot of the other characters(by deep I mean, decades worth of information). ""X"" has a deep history-really deep for a character that's only been around since 2004. This fact made the stories easy to grasp, you have the major info in X-23: Innocence Lost-where she's form/And in Nyx-what happened to her afterwards. As well as a second mini available in tpb(trade paper back)called, X-23:Target X-which links the two stories in ""X-23 & NYX"" All three titles: X-23/Target X/NYX-are a must to grasp the ""life"" that is X-23. Innocence Lost is the most vital and actually focuses on 2 ""lost"" characters-X and the other-(read the story).The story ""X-23"" is very detailed & dark story wise, not as much as Nyx-but still the tones are there.I highly recommend this hard cover-though it's hard to give a ""review"" to a title like this with out spoiling it."
1,If I wanted to listen to debussey.....,"I have the RCA CD so maybe this is different but mt problem is with the interpretaion. it lacked emotion, too slow, no fire or Brahm's strum und drang. The cello was particularly lackluster and effeminate which is a problem I usually have with him. I was very disappointed."
2,Space A Travel,"The book was great, but 6 years old. I don't know how accurate the information is now. Wish I have known that before I bought it."
1,ultimately...a real disappointment,"First off, I am not a professional woodworker...one or two little projects a year. The sander has less than 1 hour of total run time in the several years of ownership. A year and a half ago it abruptly stopped and (out of warranty) I went ahead and paid the nearly $50 for repair of the module referred to in other reviews. Went to use it today and nothing...sorry DeWalt, but I will move to a better-reviewed competitor for my next belt sander."
2,"Good ergonomics, but the good ends there","I bought this sander based on a Fine Woodworking review. Ususally they get it right, but not this time. I bought the sanding frame kit. The frame itself works well, but the stand can not be used with the dust collector and the frame doesn't fit in the stand well. The case that comes with the kit holds all of the pieces and is enormous and of little use to me because of its size.The sander is good ergonomically, I used it comfortably for about 6 hours straight while sanding a hardwood floor. However, the dust collection was poor to begin with and stopped working entirely after less than an hour. Apparently the plastic dust impeller broke, based on my visual inspection. I also knocked the dust bag off several times, as described by others. The design is just not up to snuff in my opinion.The other positive is that DeWalt will take it back for the first 90 days, so I'm sending mine back."
1,Sadly Disappointed,"I have always been satisfied with my dewalt products. I purchased this belt sander to replace a cheap 20 year old black and decker. I received the sander in April and used it to sand about 15 deck boards. The shaft for he rear roller snapped before I cnagged by first roll of sandpaper. Now I have to take time off work to drop it off at a service center 20 miles away that is only opened M-f, 7:30 am to 5 pm. I will drop this off but in the meantime I just ordered a Makita 9903. I should have read the reviews here before I ordered this dewalt sander. Spend a few extra buck and buy something better. Don't purchase anything from Nationwide tools- their return policy sucks."
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting something quite different. Definitely disappointed so far. The audio program is meant to be used along with the books. I suppose you can do this in your car if you're not driving but I don't think that's what people expect when they read: ""Learn French on the go or in your car"" I may be able to get something from this program but it is definitely not what I thought I was buying."
2,Amusing but terribly written,"I like lighter TT romances, really. I love Lynn Kurland. But this book has some problems, most of which have been mentioned by others here. It's full of anacronisms, which can be spotted almost every other page. The hero thinks in terms which are centuries from being invented. The heroine is very unreal, screwed up because her family are scientists (who are of course all unfeeling, all unemotional - where are these messed up freaks of nature - I'm a scientist and I've yet to meet any). She is also incredibly crude. Men and sex are described in the most vulgar terms (but of course the hero is a 90's kind of 16th c guy so he doesn't return the favor).And yet parts are funny in a screwball kind of way. This book reminds me of Dara Joy's High Energy in its humor, so people who liked that may like this. But fans of history and coherence beware."
2,"This isn't ""Outlander!""","I wanted to love this book. It has everything -- a hunky highlander, time travel, a spunky heroine, but it was badly written and boring. I struggled through and found it got even more preposterous at the end."
5,Boy am I glad that I stumbled onto this one!!!,"I'm kind of in a hurry, but if you're wondering wether or not to bother with this one, BOTHER BABY!!! It was a fantastic story that takes you through unexpected twists and turns. You'll never be able to guess the ending. So, curl up with a good cup of Scottish Breakfast Tea with cream and sugar, light a heather candle, and step into a misty, cool, yet hot world that you won't want to leave at the end of the book. Bon Voyage!!!"
2,Rip-off of Outlander by Gabaldon,"The concept is the same but the characterization is flawed and the world is flat. And the ending is honestly ridiculous- ""And then magic made everyone live happily ever after"". Seriously. Read Outlander by Dianna Gabaldon instead. SO much better than this one."
5,Great,Erotic almost too erotic but a story that will leave you wanting it to never end. I can't wait to read their dark highlands with Dageous in it. A wonderful book to live through.
5,Karen Marie Moning Highlander Books,"I love to read, and these books allowed me that escape I look for in my reading(stay at home mom :) I will certainly be keeping these to reread again and again!!Thanks!"
5,Superb! Gripping! Fantastic! Loads of Romance! True Emotion!,"Needless to say, I loved this book. I am very picky and a 'time travel' fanatic. This is the first book I have ever read from Ms. Moning and I am impressed. This work is very creative and interesting, a total ""must read""."
1,What a drag !,"I came to read this book because a recomendation of a friend , who said this was the book he liked most ever. The fact is that i had to make an incredible effort to go through its more than 800 pages. When i finished this book i felt kind a athlete who completes a supermarathon of 120 kilometers : very tired but also heroic, to have gotten to read this extreme long story which was so boring to me from the very beggining. Some may say that i am not up to understand the book. It can be true. But for now i have to express my impression. Maybe i decide to read this book again , lets say 4 years from now, and if a get then a different impression on the book i promisse to write a new review."
2,Incredibly Boring Waste Of Time,"I don't know what the reviewers giving this book 4 or 5 stars normally read, but this is a completely over-blown, endlessly repetitive novel. Like watching grass grow. Worse than reading Proust and that is pretty bad. I actually read through the entire novel which proves, I guess, that I have time to throw away. At least save yourself some $$$ and get it from the library, then you won't feel as if you threw your money away AND your life."
1,oh puleeez!,"thomas mann was a GREAT writer, don't get me wrong. however, it is my feeling that Magic Mountain is one of the most overrated books in history. it is dull! it is boring! it inspires somnolence! and that is being polite. thomas mann wrote so many other truly wonderful books, i find it very sad when people pick up magic mountain, throw it down in disgust and never read another book by this great author. let me name a few ... Royal Highness, Buddenbrooks, Transposed Heads, the Black Swan. i have not read the joseph books because my local library has never had the first volume in the set and i can't read them out of order. good reading to you all."
4,This is the exhaustive complete work!,"This book has been recommended by pharmacists to those of us who need a complete drug reference. It is exhaustive and comprehensive in its utility as a drug reference. If you've got to have a complete guide for your hospital or office, this is it.Now you may be thinking does this compete with the PDR?Whereas the PDR looks like a bunch of drug packaging inserts (which is fine if that's the way you want to look stuff up, I do it that way all the time) Drug Facts and Comparisons is about as complete as it comes.If you want a pocket reference, there are others. But if you need a comprehensive, definitive, gold standard reference...This is it."
1,Should Have Been A Three Part Magazine Article,"This book, full of the author praising himself, would have made a very interesting three part series in Active Trader or Futures magazine. There is not nearly enough interesting material to support building a book around it. Not a single stock market strategy discussed in this book. Highly suggest Sy Harding's ""Riding the Bear"" for beginners/intermediates to gain the stock market understanding necessary in today's tricky times."
4,"Excellent promotion for ""daytrading""","The good news is that Houtkin provides an easy read and a captivating glimpse into the world of the ""daytrader"". As one would expect it is what he doesn't tell you that will get you in trouble. Before you cash in your IRA and family jewels you may want to know that the daytrader success rate is approximately 15% not the 40% that Houtkin claims. And by the way with training,software,monthly cost of ALL-Tech"" service and a phone line your first trade will cost you $10,000-$15,000. This doesn't include the $100 000 buy in. Take your 10 grand to Vegas the casino will tell you exactly what your odds are and you will get free drinks and a nice room. And guess what; at some tables the odds are better than 'Daytrading'."
2,Not very helpful,"What disappointed me the most is that after reading this book, I could not find a single recommendation that would help me day trading. Also several technical errors leave doubt as to the quality and depth of the research done. Can I get my money back Mr. Houtkin? Probably not. By the way, where does the suit from the Massachussets SEC stand? (see Business Week Jan 6)"
5,Be grateful--not critical!,"Most people create nothing,do nothing, and blow smoke out their ass. Mr. Houtkin has been the spokesman for the individual market participant for over ten years having pioneered direct access electronic trading for the masses. People knocking his efforts don't understand the issues of todays market and are hurting themselves by being so ignorant. If the book was totally useless which it certainly isn't, it should be purchased anyway az a tribute to this man's efforts to make the market fairer."
3,Ummmmm,"Not pretty good, for the subject area it covers. On the plus side I will be making the money from reading the book. I didn't lik it as much as Getting Started in Electronic Day Trading"
3,Good introduction to the art of trading,"I thouroughly enjoyed the first half of the book, but became somewhat bored with his repetitious ideas that the marketmakers are the enemy. I finished the book craving useful strategies that are not found anywhere in this writing. The subject matter is spread all over the place and not kept in chapters. Still, not bad for the absolute beginner."
3,"Seriously,,,","Seriously, quite honestly, I don't reccomend this recording especially for flute concertos, a harp cocerto is fine though. Patrick Gallois's interpretation is sort of'incomprehensible, uncomfortable accents, wierd breathe places etc... These are not my prejudice, in facts some flutist regret that he changed his style completely; he used to play better than now!! In my opinion, you should also buy his previous recording or the same music played by the other to understand how strange this recording is."
5,Excelente todos los productos de Kinerase,"Todos los productos de Kinerase son excelentes, especialmente para pieles alérgicas o sensibles al sol. Realmente hacen ver tu piel más suave y tersa."
2,Exile Sheep,"The bonus feature titled ""Exile Fans"" should have been called ""Exile Sheep"". These artists who had nothing to do with the making of the original album, and seem to know little about it other than what they have read about it's legend and/or myth, would praise anything attached to its name. And Exile On Main Street is the last Rolling Stones album that I want to hear someone, who had nothing to do with its making, telling me about.Exile is a good album, but not without its faults, the biggest of which is it's sound quality, and if you don't know what I'm talking about you just may be an Exile Sheep also."
2,Well...,this DVD was very instrumental in putting me soundly asleep. I thought it was rather boring. Just keeping it simple here with the review.
2,Why?,"Little surprises or insights on this DVD. I agree with another customer: ""This DVD should have stayed in exile.""Why release it? Do The Stones need the money? Attention hungry? Are they senile? I gave it 2 stars because I'm a fan of The Stones(pre-Ron Wood); and it was cool seeing the basement, some never released photos, and Anita (when she was young and beautiful.)Jim Miller and Don Was have interesting comments; the celebs interviewed sound mentally impaired. The film-makers must have been desperate.This DVD has lots of surface ""filler."""
2,Clunk: This Could Derail the Series,"If I knew Mr. Martin, and he'd given me this to read before publication, I would have said, ""George, what are you doing? Why are you beginning the 4th novel in this series with 3 chapters focusing on new supporting characters that no one is familiar with? In sequels people want to encounter some familiar characters right away. THEN you can introduce the minor characters you want to add into the plot. Please, George. Also,put Tyrion Lannister in somewhere. Your readers LOVE that character! Cersei Lannister isn't a sympathetic or enjoyable character to read about, and waaaaay too much of the book focuses on her.""Alas, I don't know George R.R. Martin at all. This book was a chore to read, and I don't know if I'm going to come back for the 5th installment."
1,The Sander DW 433 with All Kinds of Problems.,"I purchased DeWalt DW 433 in November 03. After it took a month to recieve. It broke after 3 hrs. of use. I took it to DeWalt Factory Service center, but the Facrory Service Center did not carry the parts ( 3 diffrent new parts are needed !). It has been a week since I droped my sander.I do not know what is wrong w/ my sander but I can tell you a problem I see. If you put a corse grid belt sandpaper (60,40,36 or reused belt sandpaper) it will rub against the body of DW 433 because it do not have a space between the front top roller and the sander body. I keep the most of belt papers for future use, But you can not do that with this DW 433. Because a belt will expand and it will rub against the body.( the space between body and top roller is less than 1/8"" and you can not adjust it). It shoul be labeled B & D."
1,Dust Bag Worthless,"Used this sander one time for about half an eight foot board and after replacing the dust bag sixteen times in this short distance, I decided this machine was not for me. I can't believe Dewalt would make a belt sander where the dust bag is knocked/falls off the sander so easily. That little plastic slide to hold the dust bag and almost zero clearance between the dust bag and the surface is very poor engineering. I have no real clue how the rest of the machine operates as I have no use for a belt sander where the dust bag won't stay on. Well, I suppose I could duck tape it on... yeah right!!!"
5,simply amazing,"wow, their follow up to static prevails is just amazing. one of the best albums, ever. that's all you need to know."
4,Hypnotizing,"The slower songs are so hypnotic, the vocal harmonies put me to sleep but in a good way, i guess i should say its relaxing. Lucky Denver Mint, Your new asthetic, and beleive in what you want stand out. I like the faster songs better when i'm feeling impatient, but the slower songs have a place too. A lot of later bands copied or were at least influenced by this sound."
5,Crush!,"J.e.w. By far one of THE best if not THE best bands around since i can remenber! I just dont feel like typing to much so i'll just leave you all with this ok ? Buy it! Ha! The best song here to me is ""crush"" with that said...Buy it!"
5,forgotten masterpiece,This album is just incredible nothing like bleed American i'm not going to write a lengthy review of it cos i could go on forever and still wouldnt do it justice. I just say buy it NOW and discover the magic of 'Clarity' for yourself.
5,Absoultely Wonderful,"I had never really heard of Jimmy Eat World untill i saw a link to their websight on the Ataris web page (another great band) I just started getting into the emo or whatever this is but it is amazing, soothing music that will definately put you in a good mood or make you cry, no matter what the outcome it is a great cd. My favorite song on the cd is Sunday i love the xylophone at the begining and end and it is just cool. This Cd is definately worth your purchase."
3,Unclear About Whats So Great About Clarity,"Ok,most people that arent so impressed with Jimmy Eat Worlds' Futures cd say it lacks emotion and refer people to this cd or Bleed American.Bleed American I can completely understand,but I feel this cd is overrated.I actually bought Clarity after Bleed American but before Futures and it just seemed overall bland and simple to me.With the exception of Crush and Clarity and honorable mention to Believe In What You Want.So maybe Futures is overproduced,one of the many faults in the music industry,but still Lyrically and even musically I feel it makes this disc seem that much more bland.Jimmy Eat World have matured alot in their sound and are a very gifted band.Its just sad that groups cant have more creative control over their music,because I know usually what is released is what the label and or producer thinks will sell,not so much what the artist is trying to sell."
3,4th season o.c.,"i think they could have done a better job with these last epi's.i love it very much though, and the right people got married. i just thought they should have done alittle more with ryan's character. i wished they brought trey back one more time. but over it was awesome, and sad to see it end. my fav part, and this has been always my fav part, is when he drives down the drive of the house and in the haze of sunlight he passes marrisa watching him.....i think it was very beautiful. very touching scence."
5,Great!,"The OC is a great show, and I am so sad it got canceled. It started out strong and bottomed out in the 3rd season, but came back better than ever in the 4th season. The cast really did a great job, even with out Marissa. Taylor really became a loved character. Watch it!"
3,Great season...,I have this season and frankly the price should be reduced. There were only two unaired scenes on the 5th disk. I am glad I have the last season but wish there had been more special features. The things about Summer was cute and it really gave you a look at the character through Rachel's view. I haven't watched the other disks yet so hopefully there are more deleted scenes on those. I didn't see any gag reels either which was unfortunate. But if you can find it at a cheap price it is worth it to have the final season. I don't think it is worth the retail price though...atleast not yet.
2,HM,"This thing is really cool. 2 weeks ago i got it right before christmas. I bought a subscribtion for S.O.C.O.M. Navy Seals and everything. The first game i played was amazing. No lag or anything. Then the next 5 games were all lagging. I called up sony and they said it was because that the people i was playing didn't have a broadband connection. For Christmast i got offroad fury. I cant believe you have to pay for every subscription. The other day i was at my friends house who bought XBOX and XBOX Live. [The] XBOX's headset and starter kit [is reasonably priced]. It comes with a 1-year subscription for ALL games. You get your own ""gametag"" and you can play whatever games you want until your one year subscription is up. THe best thing is it is only for Broadband users so it guarentees no lag. ... Trust me, it was amazing."
4,PS2 Network Adaptor,"It works very well, and the only problem I've had with it was signing up. After that, everything works great."
5,question,"I really want to buy one, but I don't know if this Adapter works on a European Playstation 2 system. If somebody knows something about that, here is my email: GeneralMic@web.deI would relaly appreciate it if somebody could help me"
5,Very Easy Setup!,"I purchased my Network Adapter on Wednesday August 28th and 15 minutes from walking into my house, I was ready to go. All you have to do is remove the Expansion Bay cover, then take off the plastic ""plug"" on the connecter of the Network Adapter. Then put the adapter in the hole in the back of the Playstation 2. Put the setup disc in your PS2, and (or at least in my case) I pushed the X button 5 times, then waited 43 seconds, and I was setup.It is very easy, but please note that if you use Broadband, purchasing a Router may be an excellent idea. If you can't afford that then just take your Cable modem's cable out, and run another Ethernet cable (from the Back of your cable modem) to your PS2's Network Adapter.I would definatley purchase SOCOM: US Navy SEALS, with this because that is, in my opinion, the best game to play online right now."
4,Better hope it works,"I'd write a review about how much I like the adapter if it worked... Mine was DOA (Dead On Arrival), which caused me to learn something important - as far as Sony is concerned, if it doesn't work, you're on your own. Five days of regular calls to their 800 number just elicit a ""we're so popular that we can't answer your call now"" message (literally). So don't expect any help if you're having trouble, or the ability to actually get any kind of warranty service if it goes bad on you."
3,rascals peaceful world,"When groups are at the end of their run, and experience personnel changes, they sometimes change direction. Even with that said, Felix Cavaliere brought us an enjoyable, but different (more jazzy) product."
4,GREAT space saver- not easy to fit all spaces,"First, this has AT LEAST doubled the holding capacity of my little closet. So if you need more room to hang and stack clothes, this is a great product. The biggest draw back is that the product description says that ""no cutting is required"" which was key for me. As it turns out, ""No cutting is require""....IF You have the MAXIMUM (8') wide closet. Mine is just shy of 6' wide and we had to cut ALL the long horizontal pieces. All I had was a little Dremmel saw and this took FOREVER. I just want to let other potential buys know this is not ADJUSTABLE for all closets between 5 and 8 feet. It FITS 8' closets and needs to be CUT to fit smaller."
3,I should have done differnt,"All they have done here is take a couple of shelf's cut in pieces add some poles and brackets and ship with some pretty bad directions. I think the product it self is ok. I think it would be cheaper to go your local hardware store and buy the shelf, poles and hardware and build your self for half the cost. This only covered the back of our closet.I cut a half a foot off each long shelf as my closet isn't 8 ft wide it is hardly tall enough for this. Rather then spend more on something that is cheaper to do for less. I bought some closet pole hangers brackets a few dollars each installed them with anchor screws and cut some boards to place as shelf's on top of the brackets. I did this mid section of my side walls and upper side walls of side of closet for a fraction of the cost. I wish I would have thought of this prior to buying this product as its really not worth the price."
1,Impractical recipes,"This book contains a lot of useful information about nutrition, ingredients, and the differences in cheese vs. uncheese. Having said that, I have to admit I didn't find these recipes very useful. I can't vouch for taste because I didn't actually try any of the recipes. Most of them require ingredients that can only be found in a whole foods store, like nutritional yeast flakes or miso paste. You also have to plan in advance to prepare some of the recipes, like the imititation feta cheese which has to be marinated for 2 days to a week before it attains flavor. I didn't think it would be worth the effort to approximate the taste of cheese; I'd rather have the real thing. If you really need a substitute for cheese, it might be worth a shot, but if you're a real cheese lover, you might be disappointed."
2,Not for the nut allergic!,"I bought this book because my son is allergic to milk and I wanted to make some ""cheesy"" dishes that our whole family could enjoy. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the dishes call for nuts (cashews or almonds). Since my son is also allergic to nuts, this ruled out most of the recipes for us. Quite a disappointment."
5,I Remember Cheese Fondly,"I remember cheese fondly although I don't eat it anymore. Jo Stepaniak's The Ultimate Uncheese Cookbook offers recipes which make a valiant attempt to imitate the texture and flavor of dairy products, but the most successful aspect of the book is that it makes the comfort food quality of cheese available to those who may have never expected to experience it again.My favorite recipes from the book so far are the Gooey Grilled Cheez, the Durritas seasoning (the taste of Nacho Cheese Dorritos), the Unprocessed Cheez Sauce (I like it on burritos), Spinafels (Spinach Ricotta Balls), the French Onion Soup Gruyere and most recently the Philadelphia Potato Chowder. The book contains a variety of salads, dressings, soups, pasta dishes, deserts, and block uncheeses. Everything I have tried from The Ultimate Uncheese Cookbook has turned out nicely. I strongly recommend this book to vegans (or to anyone else) who would like to experience a unique collection of comfort foods."
3,"He's not much of a singer, but great for a mellow party.","Vikter's singing style is obviously breathy and demure. I would play this at an intimate house party in which I didn't want the music to overshadow the conversation in the living room. Decent beats, overall fairly good."
4,Gets better each time,"This is one of those CD's that just keeps getting better with familiarity. Etta really puts her heart and soul into each song. I bought it for ""At Last"" but now love all the songs on it. It sounds like my old 45's, but in a good way."
3,A Beautiful DESPERATION,"Hank, Jack, Edith and Terry are four friends, spouses and cheating lovers. They are all beautiful to watch. Their acting is subtle yet alluring. Their words and lack of feeling bring more desperation and isolation than is expected.They are all at a crossroads. They no longer know what love is, or if they really love or whom do they love, and it's all just sad to watch. When couples get to this place...the place of quiet desperation and at the point where there really seems like no turning back...what then do they do?They have few attractive choices.Do they give up and follow the life their actions have led them to? Do they quit altogether? Or do they start anew, with the one they made their promises to in the beginning?And even if they do try, is there any real redemption in the end?Bravo! For showing that there is hope and there is quite possibly redemption also, awaiting those who are willing to embrace it. We may forgive in this life, but do we forget?"
2,Four Great Actors in Search of a Story,"I give this two stars because the actors work their hearts out, and there are one or two nice moments. But much as I admire Larry Gross's writing, this movie is like watching paint dry--four whining, self-involved pseudo-intellectuals anguish over why they're sleeping with each other's mates. They have no reason to, and apparently no reason not to, and in the end nobody on or off-screen really seems to care. And don't go thinking it'll be erotic. It isn't: the sex scenes are purposefully ""tasteful"" and yet distasteful at the same time."
3,Needlework can be murder,"Betsy Devonshire needs a break. Her business is busy and she has finally wound up the details of her sister's estate. She is three million dollars richer, and it seems that everyone in town has an idea of how she can spend it. Her shop assistant suggests that she take a quick vacation and her friend Jill finds a way for her to mix business and pleasure. She is going to a stitch in somewhere near the Canadian border and invites Betsy along.On her first day, she meets a famous instructor, and later finds her dead. She leads the owners to the body only to find that it has disappeared. Betsy now has to find the body and the murderer if only to defend her own sanity.This was a pretty good mystery. I know nothing about needlework, but the author makes it easy with very vivid descriptions of the different disciplines. This is a quick and entertaining read."
3,"Contrived, but pleasant","In this installment, Betsy and her best friend Jill are off on a stitching retreat. But even while on vacation, Betsy is a magnet for murder.The plot of this book was even more contrived than the previous one in the series, but Betsy and Jill are nice gals and you just don't mind hanging around them as they trapse around solving murders. This is a quick, fun read for those that enjoy needlework and mysteries, but no great work of literature."
4,not to bad,The red piece screws into the base. You can change the the level of the ball by screwing it down or unscrewing it as far as possible. It has only about a 4 inch difference. The toy is very easy to put together... seems to hold up fairly well so far. It comes with two durable balls and a bat. It seems an ok level for my 2 1/2 year old But is a better fit for my 5 year old. They have beaten on this toy a ton and no cracks yet. You can also hang it by the blue base and the red stick and bat will lay flat for easy storage out of the way.
3,OK,"According to Jones, sailing is very uncomfortable and challenging, at least in open sea, ..noisy etc. He had a trimaran and said a monohull would be worse.I absolutely hate how sailors write with no thought for the lay reader, I want to learn and his vocabulary is foreign at times, when talking about boat details. That is so stupid to me! Why can't each writer define within the text each term, instead of forcing novices to skim over it. There are not only sailors in the world! Why limit your readership so much! At least have a glossory for all those terms! He just lost me and that defeats learning."
4,I Had Never Heard Of The Mountain Goats Before Today,"My ""listen"" comes from a very different place than some of the previous reviewers - I had never heard of The Mountain Goats before, and, to my knowledge, have never heard any of their songs before. I just borrowed this CD from someone and am going to buy it. It is very mellow and almost bittersweet. With the sound of the acoustic guitar and the singer coming through with occasional different tones overlaid (bells, piano, drums, etc.) for an almost otherworldly sound on some songs. Overall I really like the effect and the lyrics and it's a nice change from most of my collection which tends towards much higher energy, but more highly distracting stuff (of late White Stripes, Dandy Warhols and Interpol are new faves that I can think of offhand) and this is a nice mellow alternative."
3,Serious design flaw...,"I bought this router in October and it worked well for 5 months until the magnet ring in the motor housing broke while routing. This causes two problems when this happens: 1. The variable speed no longer works, and second, the broken magnet shards get flung into the motor brushes at a very high rate of speed causing damage. I have heard from many woodworkers that this particular DeWALT router is very suceptible to magnet ring breakage, especially when mounted upside down in a router table (like mine was). Other than this problem, the router is very well balanced with plenty of power and comes with a very nice plunge base. It just doesn't like working upside-down in a table configuration."
5,This is the one,"I have been using my router (cheep one) for a long time and been wating to invest in a better one for a while. This was the one I chose and Im glad I did. The three bases saved me money later. I liked that. I was amazed that no matter which base I chose to use I could still put it back in the case with the attached base. Someone was thinking as Dewalt usually does. Fine machine, speed controol, triger features, lots of things I would not have thought of untill after I started using it. Overall Dewalt is still my first choice on electrical wood working equipment."
1,"Does not come with bit set shown, will review again later.","I just wan't to warn anyone who sees this tool in the ""Tool Crib"" catalog and comes here to buy it. Tool Crib (An Amazon company) will give you a free set of bits when you buy the kit, and the catalog says to go to ""amazon.com\dewalt"" to order as well as by phone. Amazon even shows the same bit set in their picture, but doesn't offer this deal. I'm a new router owner and don't own any of my own bits yet, so I figured this free bit set would be good to trash while I learn more about using a router. So off to the store to get bits for my new machine....."
5,OMG THE BEST,This book is amazing and not to read it would be horrible. The mixture of suspense and fun is great and a hook to read. Each chapter changes its perspection and everything is AMAZING. I loved it and you will too !!!!
5,Different...,"If you want to learn how a writer gets along in its own story then you really should read this book. Together with the reader Meggie and the character of an other story, Farid, Fenoglio the author faces the charm and the dangers of his own fantasy.It's heartwarming how Meggie's parents are involved in her own daughter's evolution.I'm impressed how Cornelia Funke let an author be responsible for what he or she is writing. How she brings together characters who usually don't act together neither in the real world, nor in an ""Inkworld"".This book is cram-full with strong pictures, colourful imaginations and deep thoughts.This book is a challange both for the adult and the young reader.I read the German edition."
3,Book on CD disappointing,"i tried to listen to this audio book, but i did not like the narration by brendan fraser. the first book was read by a woman (i can't remember her name), and i wish they would have had her read the second book. i'm not sure what it is about fraser, but i had no desire to listen to the whole book. one of the problems i had was that he gives some of the characters such thick accents i can't understand what he is saying. anyway, i will have to get the book and read it myself, because i like the story over all, i just can't listen to the audio."
5,Inkspell,I am hoping to read this book soon. I have read other books by Cornelia Funke and she is a great writer. I love all of her books but I just need time. The adventures in this book seem to be as great as in Dragon Rider and Thief Lord.
3,I loved this book so much the first time I read it so I had to get it on my kindle,I would recommend this book to all all my friends.I gave this a awesome review.To everyone who reads the inkheart seris you are awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!--
3,Drags a bit,"Read this book from the library. Did finish it, but decided not to read the sequel, or to buy either.Kids usually know which books to read on their own - Harry Potter, Artemis Fowl, etc are all good. This one drags, and is predictable. No suspense anywhere"
2,not for adults - too boring,"Yes, thanks E. R. I felt the same. i've been inhaling books all my life, of every genre, and this is not a well-written book. the author is over-rated. i couldn't even finish the 2nd one. maybe for chilren 12 years old and under. i was reading more complex books when i was younger than that!i've been spoiled by Philip Pullman and J. K. Rowling.i give it 2 stars because i think it's ok for young children."
4,Excellent Read,"Inkspell was an excellent book, although not such a masterpeice as Inkheart. This book was slightly different from Inkheart, and wasn't my favorite read but the ending was a work of prize winning art. Any young fantasy reader should first read Inkheart and then check out Inkspell."
4,A Good Sequel to a Great Book,"Once again, Cornelia Funke's writing draws any reader in, as do her characters. This book did not tie itself up as well as Inkheart did, and didn't seem as satisfying. However, I look forward to the next part in the Ink series!"
5,An enthralling audiobook for all ages,"The sequel to ""Inkheart"", Cornelia Funke's Inkspell is an unabridged fantasy audiobook deftly narrated by Brendan Fraser about a magical story so real its characters came to life, and changed the life of Meggie, the young girl who wrote the story, forever. Now Dustfinger, the fire-eater who came into being from words, needs to return to the original tale; when he discovers a crooked storyteller with the ability to read him back, he abandons his apprentice, who in turn seeks out Meggie. The storybook has grown far more complex, and at times dangerous; together Meggie and her friend must ""write"" the wrongs of an enchanted world before a bad ending claims them all! Inkspell is an enthralling audiobook for all ages, and highly recommended. 16 CDs, 18 hours and 50 minutes."
5,"Inkheart, by Cornelia Funke",I think this book was very easy to pick up and get into but i found it hard to put it down! I immensly enjoyed this book and i recommend it to anyone who enjoys an adventure and magical story!Inkheart
4,Captivating!!,"I loved this book! I have yet to read the first one--I had to read Inkspell for a school project and I enjoyed it extensively! I picked it right up and Funke does an excellent job of updating the reader on what happened in the first novel, Inkheart.The characters truly come to life and her descriptive language is wonderful for any true fans of poetry and beautiful words.It's long...but it's worth it."
5,Great follow up to Inkheart,Um not great are you kidding? What's with everyone? My favorite books of all time are The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches and Inkheart/Inkspell. Funke has gotten so much better since Dragonrider so there!
1,STINE CAN DO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book wasn't at all the least bit scary!But it did have potential and I like that in a book. I'm just going back to FEAR STREET books because they're alot scarier and has alot more potential than GOOSEBUMPS.But I'm not saying all GOOSEBUMPS are that bad.I've read many GOOSEBUMPS series in my time and many of them I will remember for a long time
3,"Deep Trouble, R.L. Stine","I am a little disapointed to say the least. This book left out so many chances to thrill the reader, or in some cases actually cause goosebumps.. Instead, it went down the most boring of paths. It was an O.K. book. For example, I think Night of Living Dummy 3 was far superior to this book. Definately check this one out from the library,as I don't think you will want to keep it.Keep Reading..."
1,Tips over easily,"I bought two of these for my young boys. They just tip over too easily and make for a very frustrating day on the snowy hill in our backyard. Even if you pull the child carefully, up or downhill, the toy tips over sideways - a real waste of money and a lot of snow in the face."
2,Not the greatest Photoshop book available,"Not for the beginner. Nice picts, but not much direction for the novice user. Needs more tutorial info."
4,musashi guide,"the game itself is not as easy as you would think, so i was quite pleased to get this strategy guide. it has helped immensely.map layout is a little different,took some getting used to, but they do work. well worth the investment."
2,Not a beginners guide,"This is a carefully written book but, if you know nothing about Kyoto, the title might give you the false impression that it is a city that you can easily navigate on foot, which you cannot. It is a large city with good public transport but english is not as common as in Tokyo (naturally) and navigating the buses and trains that are required to reach the many destinations listed, can be very hard for a non-japanese speaker.The text is densely written, very detailed but I found it to be a little impenetrable. More of a book for the return visitor wanting to really 'dig-in' to the city and explore every nook and cranny and not (like me) for someone coming for the first time and wanting a guide to a few places reachable on foot with a minimum of fuss. I also found the maps a little difficult to use, as the larger area maps do not easily 'map' to the more detailed ones."
4,"So Far, So Good","I read several reviews on the DW735 as well as many other brands. The Rigid sounded like a good unit but I found out that dealing with HD wasn't worth it. I know several people with the 13"" Delta.....bearings, adjustments, etc keep going out.I heard that the first 735 knives may not have been heat treated properly,,,,,,,,,,,?? I haven't heard many problems since.Friends that have the DW735 all like it and they've used them a good deal. They keep their rollers clean and don't try to make real deep cuts and they've had good luck.So, I just bought one. I have had no snipe on either end or any other problems so far. Wood feeds fine and the unit does what it should.Time will tell."
4,Works well at either speed.,"Works way better than the equivalent JET and much better than my (really) old Mikita. I recommend the folding table accessory, but I still get snipe on short boards. (Probably a matter of adjustment). I had been dreading the day that the blades needed to be changed (turned around actually, blades have two edges) but that turned out to be a snap! The rotating drum has pegs that fit into alignment holes in the blades. I rarely use it on the 'finish' speed (179 cuts per inch) as it works just fine at 'rough' 96 cpi. I've had no trouble at all going down to 1/8 inch thickness. However, connected to my dust collection system, chips fall back down onto the table surface!? It doesn't do that when it isn't connected to the dust collection system, so I don't know what that's all about. It's an ear buster, and it pretty well needs a dedicated 20 amp circuit."
1,YOU'VE CHANGED MY MIND!!,"After reading the reviews and recalling other bad experiences with Dewalt service I'M RETURNING MY PLANER I purchased yesterday.I'm fed up with manufacturers treating their customers like morons. Did you not think the design flaws would be noticed, Dewalt???I've always stayed away from DeWalt products since my first encounter with their ""customer-service"". (that's an oxy-moron in itself).No more Dewalt tools for me!!"
3,Consider the Makita 2012NB before buying this one.,I read a review of one of the many (it seems) unsatisfied dewalt DW735 customers. One reviewer mentioned wishing that he had his Makita planer back. So I started looking at the Makita planers and bought one. If you check out the reviews by the Makita 2012NB owners you will see that they are satisfied with their machines. I just bought one and I will follow up with a review of how it works. I have 100BF of curly maple to plane.I am now following up this review after running 100BF though this planer. The Makita is working great and almost no snipe. That is saying alot considering curly maple is such a tough grain. Anyways I hope this review helps.
1,DEWALT 735 PLANER,I OWN A DEWALT 735 PLANER THAT HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP 4 TIMES WITH FEED PROBLEMS. THE PERSON SERVICING THE PLANER SAID HE COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE PLANER I RAN 4 BOARDS THROUGH IT AND THE FEED ROLLER SEIZED UP AND BROKE THE SPROCKET AND CHAIN ALONG WITH THE COVER. THIS HAS PUT ME OFF DEWALT PRODUCTS. DENNIS WILLIAMS
1,Do not buy,"I have the same experience as others. The planer stated to produce raised lines after less than an hour of use. It doesn't feed wood of any with or thickness well. The features are appealing, but the planer just does not work."
2,Disappointing,"I expected much more from a Nobel deserving author. Morrison failed to grab my attention. This was my third of fourth attempt at reading this novel, and I finally finished. I loved her style and technique. I also thoroughly enjoyed the characters and imagery. But I found the plot to be quite unenjoyable. I don't think that a theme ever developed. If you want to read something by Morrison, DO NOT choose Jazz. Thus far, Song of Solomon is still my favorite. This warning comes from a Morrison fan who has also read Beloved and Sula. I decided to share this with others since so few have obviously submitted reviews. Morrison is a great authour, but Jazz is far from a great book."
4,Vegas Casino Fun,"One of Playboy's best DVD releases out there. The whole feature has a nice set up. Inbetween the nudity scenes, they show the casino and parties that the models are talking about. You might even see a flash or two at the parties. All of the scenes are great, although the video only gets 4 stars because a few of the scenes drag out a little too long with the same action. Overall you will not be disappointed with this DVD. This DVD also features a bonus feature of Irina Voronia (Miss January 2001) and it is a very nice edition to the DVD if you know what I mean. Pick this one up today!"
2,Dewalt Planer Dust Collector,Results are modestly satisfactory. Overall a quality shop vac will serve the same purpose with less capacity but is adequate for occasional usage. Complete containment of dust is not possible as very fine particles escape from the top of the hood. Over priced.
2,Yes it works.. but the HCL smell is too much,"Most betaine / HCL will either come in a gel capsule, and not smell, or be coated in something to mask the smell. whatever the coating is with this product, there is no masking the smell. The smell is horrible, stays on your hands, and lingers for minutes.These definitely get the job done, but as a regular betaine user, I have put these in one of our vehicles for 'just in case' use when we are out and about. I cannot stand the smell on a regular use basis."
4,Excellent to re-cap your fundamentals,The solved problems are terrific and classic examples encountered.The text is well written and understandble.
4,In response to an earlier review,"TO the writer who had a bone to pick. This book compairs the two method of teaching dyslexics, the traditional as well as the Davis method. Traditional methods don't work for everyone. I know because I have been there. My so is dyslexic through and through! He fell through the cracks because of the traditional method of drilling phonics over and over and over! If it weren't for the Davis method his dyslexia would have driven him into the groung. Now he is a bright, cheery, well adjusted child because they taught him how to use his ""gift"" to it's fullest by giving him the tools he needs to over come the obsticles."
3,Missing maps,"This seems to be a comprehensive account of what's gone on with the Jews, the Palestinians and the rest of the players. It is done with no narrative, or very little, using actual documents from the interested parties. So you can read govenment docs, League of Nation's docs, speeches, organizational charters, interviews, policy statements etc and a lot of it is quite eye opening. However, the fact that there are no maps is a major oversight. Some of us are not intimately familiar with that region or the intricate permutations that have occurred over time. To have maps of the evolution of the divisions of the land would have been enlightening and I think really necessary."
5,Excellent Documentation,"This book presents an excellent overview of the major documents which shaped the Mideast conflict. It is an invaluable resource for anyone who likes to sift facts from fancy and should be consulted by whoever plans to write on this exceedingly difficult problem the First World War has left in its wake. The book should also be consulted by every journalist and media pundit. To expect that our politicians will do so is probably too much to hope for, although they would sorely need it."
1,Not much use if can't hook up to a compressor,"Does anyone know where I can buy a 3/8"" NPT male with a 1/4"" Series Coupling for this Hitachi air nailer?The nailer arrived a month ago and we still haven't used it due to fact we can't find the 3/8"" air fitting. Would it have cost Hitachi a lot of money if they had just sold the nailer with one installed? I would have gladly paid $10.00-20.00 for them to do so. I'll bet I'm not the only one with this problem as everywhere I look they have 1/4"" NPT male or 3/8"" NPT male with a hose clamp fitting."
3,Not enough power,"I used many brands of framing guns and found the Hitachi NR83A to be a good reliable gun. The main positives are it's durability and that it is easy to get parts. On the downside, it doesn't sink nails in LVLs unless the pressure is over 120, the metal magazine can get bent and then the nails hang up. Overall, it is a good gun and I am waiting for someone to come up with a better full head nailer."
1,"Professional Framers beware! Was the best, not now!",They have changed the internal parts! I had the driver break on the first week of owning this new model. This gun is junk now! (and this is the opinion of other contractors and tool suppliers also.)What used to be the top framer gun is now just a name now. Hitachi has gone way down hill. Switch to the Max or some other brand.
1,Made in Taiwan!!!,"I ordered this nail gun expecting it to be the same ""Made in Japan"" quality item I am familiar with. The pictures on Amazon's website even show a made in Japan model. Instead what I got was a consumer grade ""Made in Taiwan"" model which says NR82A2(Y) on it. Not sure what the Y stands for, but this is not what I ordered and it will be going back. Amazon needs to do better in representing this for what it is. These are the same type sold by chain stores, not the professional model I needed and expected. I'm hoping this was an oversight by Amazon and not a bait and switch."
1,Outdated. Worthless.,"Pretends to be written by practitioner, so my expectations were quite high.Alas, it is actually written in dry academic style, with lots of useless top-level outlines.As of 2012, most of practical techniques referred there are very outdated.Do not buy it."
2,Buy this only if you are a serious Hendrix fan!,"This is only worth while to the real hard core Jimi fan. If you want to see who the ""Experiance"" really was, then you might like this. You can also see some mistakes Jimi made during ""Sunshine of your love"". He seems to have gotten lost somewhere in the song's solo. But this is a good example of the bands nature. There is also a live perfomance of Purple Haze which is pretty good considering it was from a filming. There is not a lot of high tech used here."
4,NOEL ...,"This is a great video, and has excellent performances all around except for Noel. Time and time again, Noel just doesn't work. He isn't involved in the song the same way Jimi or Mitch are. I mean, that is one ...bass solo during the seemingly 40 minute version of ""Sunshine Of Your Love."" While doing his ""solo,"" Noel pauses and SCRATCHES HIS NOSE. COME ON, WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! Jimi should have thrown him off the stage, or gotten a bass player that puts his playing before a scratch he had on his nose. Noel's backing vocals are also whinny and raspy. Let Mitch take some of the vocals (if he's not scratching his nose). So in short, Jimi and Mitch are spectacular, but Noel is enough to give this excellent collection four stars."
5,planer table,This is a very strong well built table and recomend it for the strongly for use with the planer 735. A plus is the moble base
5,Very Strong and Stable!,"Very well made and easy to assemble. Has a lot of versatility that will allow it to be used for many purposes. Well worth the money, and I don't think I could build one nearly as well for the price. I like it so well that I am going to order at least one or two more."
5,Outstanding Value,"When one compares this table/stand against the overpriced junk available at Lowe's/Home Deport this table wins easily. Great design, rugged, rigid, excellent material, versatile, and inexpensive. Damn good value. If you're going to use this stand for something other than the planer don't buy the extension table wings, for they mount on the planer not on the stand. Assembly directions were poor, but pointed in the right direction. Shipped quickly. When I get bigger shop area I'll buy another of these stands, they're that good."
3,"Great Stand, Bad Assembly Instructions","As others have mentioned, this base is rick solid. However, I've found that the first step of the assembly instructions are wrong. The instructions assume the base comes preassembled, but the base was not preassembled in the package I received. I contacted DeWalt customer support and rather than acknowledge that there is a problem, they just forwarded me the existing wrong instructions. I did find an exploded bill of materials on the DeWalt support site that I was able to use to put the base together. After that, everything went together easily.I guess that's the quality of customer service we should expect today."
4,Dewalt Planer Stand,The stand was easy to assemble and heavy duty.The minor problem I had with the assembly had to do with adjusting the single wheel.
1,Dewalt DW7350,"I would be glad to review this product, however I never received it. It was on a special at Amazon for $113.00 free freight. Never got sent according to Fedex. Now to reorder it the price has gone to $147.25. I have tried to call Amazon, and got some foreign speaking person, who I could not understand very well and all she could tell me was they will issue me a credit. Told her I don't want the credit, wanted the DW7350 Planer stand as advertised. So this was ordered on 6-17-10, as of today 7-20-10 ,I still do not have the stand or my credit. I never had this kind of service from Amazon. Very dissappointed.Mike L.State College, PA"
5,Plane and Simple,"In all likelihood the first reaction of someone considering the purchase of the DW735 Planer is going to be that the stand is simply too expensive. And it is dear. I didn't buy this table at first, but used a standing table I had in the shop. The only problem was that moving the planer about in a small shop rapidly becomes a weightlifting exercise. The DW7350 is the heaviest of the portable planers. To solve this DeWalt as brought out this heavy-duty, rigid table that moves easily on its casters. Once you break down and decide to purchase it you are going to wonder why you didn't have it right from the start. Mine came with a midway shelf, which doesn't appear in the picture. Working height is excellent. Assembly is pretty straightforward as well."
3,DW7350 Mobile Planer Stand Assembly,"A good solid stand for a planer. However, the assembly instructions suck.1. Nuts and bolts are really 13 mm, not 1/2"".2. Very poor illustration.3. The foot pedal is a hazard mounted 'outboard'. It is much better mounted 'inboard' and actually functions better in that position. To make the foot petal easily usable 'inboard' you must reverse the actual foot petal on the pre-assembled unit. Remove the retaining clip (split ring pliers do not work, use a screwdriver) and just reverse (180 degrees) the petal.All parts will be used with none left over, so read the instructions carefully."
5,Great product,"Easy to assemble, rolls smoothly, feels very strong and securely holds my planer. You can't do better than that, really! It is sometimes tricky to get my foot in there to trigger the push pedal. Sometimes I forget to put it back down and plane with it up on its wheels, but it's never moved so far."
5,Can't imagine not having this,The 735 is heavy - the handles are nice but I wouldn't want to be carrying this around much. The wheel arrangement with the lever is a little goofy if you have it on the inside and if you opt to put it on the outside it is too much of a tripping hazard and in the way. The picture doesn't show the lower shelf which is handy but it makes accessing the wheel lever awkward at best.
5,Big roll of tickets,Picked these up for a raffle and they worked great. Nice and bright! With the 1000 tickets we had plenty left over for next year.
1,$549 Poorer,"The blades dull very quickly, making this a bad choice for anyone planing anything but a small quantity of hard wood."
2,alternative blades,Infinity Tools makes a HSS replacement blade set for only $4 more than this set. It isn't carbide but it is premium German tool grade steel. That's a start.
4,Flying Dutchman Overtures soars !!,"I have not heard this entire CD ( though maybe Ive heard these tracks on other CD's) but I just heard the Flying Dutchman Overture with Maazel conducting. Terrific !! Let's face it, what we want to hear in this piece of music is (as in the Tannhauser Overture) the coda building up to the soaring finale where the measure of the performance is how much intensity can the conductor pull from the orchestra in these critical moments. In this performance Maazel stretches out the climb, suspends it at the top of scale, and the descent to the bottom of the scale where he holds the orchestra to the limits of your emotion before releasing it into the final seconds. This may be the best Flying Dutchman Overture I've heard."
2,"good tool, not the best","i found this tool on sale at a local store. being a very satified owner of the makita 12v impact driver, i made sure i could return the tool if it didn't measure up.got it home, charged it up and went to work. the tool felt great in my hand and really performed well. i was thrilled with my new toy when the battery began to croak while driving the 15th 3"" screw into a soft pine log. i chalked it up to the brand new battery being not charged fully. i decided to do a side-by-side comparison. i charged my five year old makita 12v impact driver and my new hitachi. i ran three inch scews into pine logs. the makita was dead after 16 screws. the old makita burried 42!i hope hitachi can rectify this problem because this tool feels great and performs well when the batteries are fresh. if the battery doesn't improve, they need to include two chargers and four batteries."
5,Good book for getting a handle on DB access in .Net,"The book is well layed out and clearly written. It can be read out of sequence. Each chapter is self contained. It shows how you can get a free copy of MSDE sql server 2000 and deftly outlines the versions and how to get started using it. It begins with a good recap of basics of database. It follows with basics of sql. Then does excellent job of enabling you to handle administrative tasks of sql on your machine and getting started. It talks about new interface ADO, ASP Net and ties in xml. Well done. Got me going from startup."
3,Einstein,"It's heavy reading. There are very complicated concepts. It is still interesting to try to get a grip on. If you've had limited experience with certain mathematical concepts, you may not get a lot out of this."
5,One Great Book!,"Honestly, I didn't know this was still available. I think that it is one of the best time management books out there. Would definitely recommend it!"
5,Versatile product that covers everything from bread to seafood,"I used this for frozen Italian bread so it does not get soggy. This also works great for steaming seafood - crab legs, etc. I'm sure it has many more uses!!"
2,uneven shuffle,"Not a good product at all. it shuffles... but its very uneven and likes to grab lots of cards from each side when it works. We are playing a card game that has alot of cards so its hard to shuffle by hand. i tried mixing a new deck with the old and noticed it was very uneven, giving a few from the old deck, then 10 from the new deck, then 7 from the old deck, and then 1 from the new... and so on. bad quality all around. i found that moving the cards around in the top tray can help, but not enough. i'm going to look for different shuffler now."
3,Please in :Joplin,"I have used one for several months now and have purchased as gifts for friends. Recently I did have a problem with My Card shuffler, but upon calling the company a new one was sent out immediately with absolutely no hassle. Can't tell you how that rates your customer service to me! I have made sure that everyone I know knows of the good backing behind your product. Good Job!"
3,Works OK,"I bought it for uno playing, but only works well for brand new cards. I tried on the poker cards too, same thing. So if you play a lot & dont mind to keep getting new cards, then this is the item you want!"
2,died after a year,"We used this 3-4 times a month for just over a year and were happy with it. Unfortunately, it died and replacing the batteries didn't get it going. We're disappointed it didn't last any longer."
2,Poor Quality,"Bought 2 for my 80 year old parents. When working, they were okay. Nothing special, but did the job. Within a few months both of them broke. I used the parts of one to fix the other. That one lasted another few months then broke. Between the 2 they lasted a total of 15 months. Very poor quality. I will look for a different brand."
4,"Battery operated, 6 deck shuffler","We have a pretty avid group of hand and foot canasta players and typically use 6 decks. So this kind of shuffler is a mush. The price is right, and the product does what it is supposed to do, quite well. It would be nice to have an AC version."
3,Gets the job done?,"I probably bought this for the same reason many others did. I play card games (sometimes with as many as six decks) and wanted a break from the shuffling. My feelings on this product are mixed.Pros: 1) It shuffles cards.Cons: 1) Very cheaply made. I get the feeling that if I drop it, it will shatter. Looks cheap. 2) Not sure how well it is actually shuffling the cards. Cards on one side are always being ""shuffled"" faster than the other side. To compensate, I have to load a greater number of cards on the ""faster"" side and cannot split decks evenly. 3) It's noisy. Once baby goes to sleep, there is no way I'm breaking this guy out.All in all, if you have a large number of decks, then it may be worth it. I find that if I only have two or three decks worth of cards, then I'm more inclined to shuffle manually than use this product."
1,Did not work .....but pleased with Amazon,"Purchased as a gift. Did not work at all. Tried two different sets of brand new batteries to be sure they were not the problem. Will return for a replacement.Amazon made returning this product very easy. Hopefully, the new one will work, but I realize that Amazon is not the manufacturer, and cannot be responsible for the quality of workmanship. However, Amazon is to be applauded for its good customer service. Thanks"
2,card shuffler,one side doesnt not move the cards. very disapointed with this. dont know if its only this one item or if LL ARE LIKE THIS
3,Just a slight problem,The shuffler works great for six decks. One of the battery compartment covers comes off so I had to tape it on.
2,casino 6 deck automatic card shuffler,"I have had one of these before about 2 years ago and we worn it out, This one does not shuffler the cards evenly and then some get upset down. We haven't given up yet but are close. I was looking for a different mfg. but do not see one."
5,Casino Card Shuffler,Received the 6 deck card shuffler. I was well pleased with the length of time it took to receive. All thosein the group that I play cards with liked the shufflerand were surprised at the price. Great deal.
1,Don't bother,I was warned by several friends that these shufflers don't work. It was cheap enough so I thought I would try. Never could get it to work. Tried several different batteries. Had to return it.
5,6 deck card shuffler,"This 6 deck card shuffler does a great job of shuffling when we're playing Hand and Foot, which requires several decks of cards. It makes shuffling the cards so much easier."
4,Shuffler,It works well for the most part but from time to time is a little temperamental. I would buy it again.
4,Works great for the price,"While its not without its flaws, this deck shuffler is a great deal for the price. You just have to make sure that it doesnt jam and that the cards that sometimes get stuck on the side get put on the bottom of the deck for poker purposes. Saves alot of time to say the least while playing a game of hold em. BE SURE TO USE DIFFERENT DECKS or you wont know which is which."
4,Awesome shuffler!,"We play a lot of games with 4-6 decks. This shuffler is fast and it sure saves on your hands. Be sure to order the one that uses ""C"" batteries. Not meant for children. This little gadget is flimsy and could break easily if not taken care of."
5,The best,"I recently adquire this to play at home, and it is the best. We play just for fun and with this product we can play faster without losing time shuffling the cards"
1,shuffler never worked from day 1,I got a brand new shuffler several weeks ago used it at a party and whata flop it did not shuffle the cards -- had to sit and turn the gears by hand to even get some to shuffleBad item
1,It's a dud,"This does not work - it will only take a few cards at a time. It was purchased to be able to shuffle at least 6 decks, but it won't do 5 at a time. It has to be ""hand fed"" a few cards at a time on one side - the little roller doesn't catch the card and send it into the bin otherwise. Also, the clear plastic ""catcher"" has to be held at an angle so the cards don't jam. What a waste of money."
5,Happy card player,"This card shuffler uses ""C"" batteries which is great. It is very heavy duty and works great. It is nice to spend more time playing and less time shuffling."
3,Cards constantly get stuck.,Cards get stuck constantly. Tried three different cards still stick. Bought another and still gets stuck. Need a new product. Not useful.
2,Dont buy junk,"One the second try a spring broke and allowed the card holder to drop to the bottom.We now try to use it without the card holder,but a great many cards always end up reversed either face up or on the side of the card pile.If I could I would send it back.it nothing but a pile of CHEAP plastic."
3,Uneven shuffling,It didn't shuffle even unless you put a little pressure on the cards that didn't shuffle as fast as the other side.
4,6-Deck Automatic Card Shuffler,"This is a great tool to have when playing ""Hand and Foot"" or other games where more than 4 decks are needed. A draw back is that they usually don't last a very long time. Frequently one side of the shuffler begins to give out or pull cards slower than the other. It helps to hold that side of cards up a bit to force the cards in better. The shufflers are fairly cheap to replace, when and if this happens."
5,Card Shuffler,This is a good tool for shuffling more then one or two decks of cards.It is a little louder then I would like but it does the job.I only wish this and many other items were made in the USA
4,Has work flawlessly so far!!!,"Had some doubts after reading some of the other reviews but it has work rather well, so far!!!Only the drawer seems a litle flimsy when you are using 4 decks or more."
3,does its job,it works good and was received quick . i had a little problem with it shuffling even but fixed it easily by puting more cards on one side.
3,6 Card Deck shuffler,"Shuffler works great, but a piece of plastic corner was broken when received in the mail. Half the price than found at a nationwide chain, so decided not to complain."
3,6 deck automatic card shuffler,"Product is better than shuffling by hand. Price is too high for what you get. They advertise free shipping, but when you get the product, you realize the shipping was built into the price. It is cheaply made, and probably will not last too long. Like I said, it IS better than shuffling by hand."
3,Useful but...,"I play cards weekly and glad to have the larger shuffler to use. Our group of 10, have replaced three of these in a three year span. The plastic is very thin and breaks easily. The price is to high if over $12.00 for the fact that it does not hold up to moderate use."
3,Jams too easily,I found that I had to make sure that the rotating cams that fed the bottom cards off of the two stacks were set to alternate properly each time I ran the cards through the process. The problem with the design is that it uses two independent motors to throw the cards from the two stacks into the middle and would often get into a state where each was trying to feed the cards at the same time. The design could definitely be improved.
5,Great!,"Other than being a little noisy, it works great. Saves a load of time shuffling, and is easy to use."
3,Great when it works,"This is about my third one. The first one was fantastic and lasted a long time; the second one about a month so we're hoping this one has a longer working time. For some reason, the cards turn sideways and it flips the cards. BUT it beats shuffling 6 decks when your hands don't work so good."
2,Not very impressive,"DeWALT's 13"" planer does need some kind of infeed and outfeed support, but these extension tables are not sufficient. They are formed of thin sheet metal, and easily deform/bow in the middle when planing anything stiff enough to need the tables. Both are made to fold up out of the way, but only the one on the infeed side can physically be folded up. The outfeed table will hit the planer if folded. Neither is made to be secured in place after folding up. However, both can be easily removed without tools. Also, adjustments are easily made with screws that use the planers integral hex wrench."
5,Must have. Easy set up.,Must have for the Dewalt 735 planer. Easy to set up. Due to dust port location the back table does not fold all the way up.
5,DW735 Planer Tables,This is a must addition for the DW735 planer. The added stability for in-feed and out-feed of wood stock almost limits snipe entirely. They make a quantum leap in the quality of the planer.
4,735 folding table,They work ok. They are smooth so there is no friction and they seem to be level with the bottom of the planer so nothing catches. My only complaint is that you have a hard time using the provided hangers for wrapping the cord if you need to put the outfeed table up as I do when I store the planer.
5,A really good book for extensive knowledge,"Though this book is indimidating on the first instance, It might be an ideal book if it is read more for knowledge than Grades.It presents an extensive views on different architecture and even starts from explaining the TURING machine in the first chapter and ending with the Network architecture in the last chapter.It has extensive views on how different digital circuits can be created using gates and most of the book covers this aspect of digital circuit design.Such an extensive book should be considered for a 2 semester course rather than a one semester."
5,Can't imagine something better at this price point,"I've had mine for about 5 years now. The reason I decided to write a review now is the blades finally dulled, I am a amateur woodworker limited use on weekends. I was dreading having to change the blades on it. I had to replace the blades on my jointer recently and went through several set up tools/methods before I finally found the OneWay multi gauge that helped me set that up right. I was thinking I might be in for another ordeal with this planer. Not so, this was the easiest can't screw it up if you tried, set up imaginable. Pin locators on the cutter head line the blades up perfectly, no adjustment possible...or necessary. Two sided blades so I just turned them around, tightened the blade holder back down and I was done. Less than 20 minutes and the planer works like new cutting super smooth. I highly recommend this planer for the great performance and the ease of blade replacement/setup. 5 stars."
4,Good product that is over priced,"Amazon sale price-$499.22Everyone else-$399.00 (standard price).Comparing to my Delta 2-blade 12"" planer, this DeWalt is more expensive to buy and more expensive to replace blades. In return for the bucks I see no appreciable difference. I've never had problems w/ DeWalt tools (own many), but my Delta tools have proven equally good- at less cost to buy and cheaper to maintain (blades, batteries,etc.)If you must pay extra for the DeWalt name, look at Home Depot, ToolUpStore or elsewhere for better price. I buy a lot thru Amazon - but this is no deal. I also like DeWalt, when the price is competitive.Product-4 starsPricing-2 stars"
4,"Planing with the DeWalt ""734""","The ""734"" did a fine job on the 20 plus boards that I planed starting with rough sawed 1"" red and white oak. I planed them down to 11/16"". The process was slow and sometimes I had to help push the boards through. Oak being very hard was probably the problem. The finished boards were beautiful. These were random widths up to 10"" and all were 8' long.I needed a steady rest with a roller to aid in carrying the board as it went through the planner. I used a ""work mate"" to set the planner on, but it would have been nicer with a regular stand that was made for a planer.I used my shop vac to collect all the saw dust/shavings and it worked well, except I had to empty it often. I filled up two plus 55 gal. plastic garbage bags. Be prepared for lots of saw dust!I would recommend the ""734"" to anyone who does occasional planing. If you are making cabinets everyday, buy an industrial plane."
3,not competitive,"I purchased this Item at lowes last week for $359 and am so far happy with its performance. It does have more snipe problems than I expected, but not excessive for this price range. I was wanting to purchase this item from Amazon but their higher price was a disincentive."
2,Mediocre Glove,"This glove was just OK...I like the leather palm, but it just doesn't fit as well as other gloves that I have tried. You can feel the seams in the fingertips and the glove left blisters on my hand, and blisters are caused by movement. Make sure you get a good fitting glove. The Mechanix Wear 4.0 glove is similar to this glove but with a better fit, any of those gloves are better than this pair."
4,eps only get 4 stars,well if you never thought it was possible to have 2 more greats on one cd here you have it introducing lard!! with our favorite punk activist (jello biafra)and our favorite groove industrial power house(ministry)well this album i like the best i thought thelast couple did to much dabbleing in metal then this one. i think time to melt is an awesome song to wake the neighbors up at 4 in the am with you speakers lying out side your windows.wait dont take my advice just buy the cd and you decide what you want to do with it!
5,Windows XP Top 100 tips,"A very interesting book, I wish it had been available before. Even the newest newcomer could use it , every thing is simple and easy to understand. An XP bible."
1,I left it on the airplane!!,"I bought this book for a recent cross country flight. I enjoy the ""British neurotic single woman"" genere and thought this book would be just the ticket to entertain me during a 5 hour flight. It was SO BAD that I left it on the plane!! Do not waste your time on this book."
1,BORING,"I know there's been a lot of press on the new 'Chicklit' movement and have seen many Helen Fielding wanna-bes out there lately. some have been decent, but fluff (Confessions of a Shopaholic), but then there's this one...pure waste of time....unbelievable main character (I wanted to slap her uside the head for being so passive) and gratuitous sex..I mean, really unnecessary-I felt like the author could have given Cassandra some help with some of the laughable sex passages at the end of the novel with Anna and her guy. I mean, what was the point of that? to show how unsatisfied she was with _____? Don't waste your time....."
3,Panamá,"Just looking for pictures of the canal construction days and people workin on the big ditch, but no one in this book, deception!"
4,"You'll either love it or hate it, either way read it.","Everyone should read this book. Because identity, power, and the present are so wrapped up in how we interpret the past, the book is essential for understanding how there are multiple valid interpretations of history that can exist and be interwoven. Warning: some knowledge of Stonehenge is required to comprehend certain parts of the book."
2,Broken on arrival!,"I knew this was a Memorex so I really wasn't expecting all that much. I bought it for my 2 year olds room so she could listed to the nature sounds or an audio book now and them. Although it looks sleek, the row of buttons on the top are far from intuitive. Would be impossible to find a particular button in a poorly lit/dark room. Cheap volume wheel on the side and very cheap slider switches for am/fm, nature sounds, dim settings etc. The reason it's going back though is the broken tuner display. When you spin the cheapo dial on the side to change radio stations the digital display doesn't change from ""82.7"". It flickers like it wants to change...but it doesn't. Since I don't plan to use this as a radio in her room I did consider keeping it. But the overall poor design swayed me. Hope I can find that receipt..."
1,So very bright,"Overall it seems to be a decent product, but the display (even on the dim setting) keeps me up at night. It's so bright that I have to turn the clock away from the bed just to get to sleep and then turn it back when I want to see what time it is in the middle of the night."
3,"OK, not great","A typical light-duty bar clamp for woodworking. However, clamp jaw pads are not included and the beam is easily bent in shipping. I would recommend the Columbian SumoGrip clamps as an alternative."
4,"Excellent, as usual","This Celtic Woman DVD is fantastic. Not only do the girls sing and play at their best but also the site chosen is amazing. however, I don't know exactly why I liked their previous DVD a little more, and that is why I'm giving this one 4 stars. But anyhow, Celtic Woman still ranks #1 in my music preferences."
4,BEST YET,"THERE HAVE BEEN MANY VIDEOS OF THE ""CELTIC WOMAN"" SHOW. IN MY OPINION, THE 2010 VERSION IS THE BEST YET. I HAVE PURCHASED ENOUGH COPIES TO DISTRIBUTE TO MY EXTENDED FAMILY.ALSO, AMAZON HAS THE BEST SHIPPING POLICIES."
3,Wonderful but video quality could be better,"I love Celtic woman, one of my very favorite groups and they deserve 10 stars. The problem with this dvd was the video quality. I have a 50 inch plasma and most regular dvd's look great with my blu ray player that up-converts them. This dvd was not crystal clear as these girls deserve. It was fairly blurry and that is disappointing. The singing and performance was great."
2,didn't work,When my tape came it would not play. I sent it back. I was charged a fee for opening it. I called Amazon and they waived the extra fee. The customer service person was both helpful and professional. I will order from Amazon again.
4,Songs From the Heart,"Performances were superb, camera coverage good. Top performance, but not quite as good as the programe at Slane Castle.""Amazon Verified Purchase"""
5,Great Help - A Must Read for Yahoo Store Owners,This is a great book for Yahoo Store owners to know the best way to spend time and money in developing their Yahoo Store. I was able to benefit from this book by making a number of changes to my site. Rob is able to explain things in such a way that even I am able to figure out! I'm looking forward to the next edition!

Go Dummies!"
3,"Energetic, but immature Perlman","This being Perlman's first recording, at such a young age, you can hear the imbalance in his phrasing and sound in the first movement at certain times, however, he does manage to form a grand picture of this large masterpiece.The sound of the harsh landings on his bow in the last movement can be either exciting or annoying. I find it the latter. Its not a bad recording, but it isn't the greatest one around."
2,Have they changed the Angel formula?,"It was love at first sniff when I first discovered Angel. I just finished the first bottle I splurged on last year, and immediately ordered this larger size. But something is really not right. This perfume smells different, NOT the Angel I knew and loved. It's flat, doesn't have the same odor AT ALL and even after FOUR sprays, (three more than I ever needed before,) I still can barely smell it ten minutes later. This is the exact product I had, or so it appears, but it sure doesn't smell the same. Something smells rotten, but I don't know why. Did someone knock off Angel?"
4,Lovely but not on me!,"I am so disappointed by this lovely scent. I smelled it for years on an elderly aunt and finally learned what she was wearing. My soul! Angel smells amazing on her! I just could not get enough of this lovely, long-lasting fragrance. Knowing how scents alter with a person's chemistry, I determined to try it first. I spritzed some on my neck and wrist at the mall and boy, was I shocked. Angel just does not smell nice on me. It was much too musty and powdery.Fair warning: try before you buy."
1,Not the product I expected!,"I would not recommend. It is not the scent I buy from the dept. store. If you order it, you will be disappointed like I was. The identifying number was razored out and resealed and shipped to me. I will not purchase from here again. Lesson learned."
5,Angelically Delicious,"I have been an Angel wearer for over 8 years now. It is the only perfume that I wear. I get compliments from men and women whenever I wear it.My only suggestion is that if you are interested in this perfume, wear a sample because it is one of those fragrances that does not smell equally delicious on everyone."
2,Painful,Ambivalent Zen starts slow and goes slower. It took two attempts to get through it. All the Zen masters in the book have feet of clay. Shainberg struggles for the entire three hundred pages and so did I. If you are looking for a book about Zen this saga is not what you are looking for.
1,Lame Lame Lame,"This book was so bad I decided to forego the last 20 pages. here's why: 1. It acknowledges that it's a ""Faust"" knockoff 2. Gore is used as a substitute for plot 3. Big gaping holes--the coincidences are ridiculous 4. The heroine (pun intended) serves only to set the hero up for the next ""scary"" scene 5. Like all bad horror, it's premised on people doing stupid things that they would never really do if it weren't necessary to move the storyline forward. 6. Is this really just about how *bad* gambling is for your soul??"
2,Not enough detail,I didn't find this book to be very helpfull. You might as well read the online documentation.
2,unfortunately difficult to clean,"They were fun, and sure stimulate several wonderful places- BUT can't easily be sterilized nor cleaned... the BEST buy is a pair of Smartballs from Fun Factory- more expensive ($14-$29) but well worth it!"
4,Funny and entertaining vampire flick,"I first encountered this movie during a trip to England where it was titled ""Lesbian Vampire Killers"" - a much better title that what ended up in the US. At any rate, the movie arrived in the States intact and is well worth watching if you enjoy comedy horror with a lighthearted hint of of sexual innuendo. There are some wonderfully funny moments of off-the-wall British humor (along the lines of ""Shawn of the Dead""). Totally silly and totally entertaining and highly recommended."
1,Poor choice,"The Kinamax WebCam is a very poor choice. I purchased 5 of them, all create software problems (under Vista and XP,) all have audio/driver issues and the video color palette is severely off.For a few dollars more, the Microsoft Live WebCam is a MUCH better solution!"
2,get what you pay for,"I purchased this item 2 months ago, tried it with windows 7 using Vista drivers from their website.. couldn't make it work. Emailed support to see if there will be Windows 7 drivers .. answer: not sure, if we do we will let you know. Hooked up to a XP machine, works ok if the ambient lighting is ok, not so good in low light, don't know what the LED's do, never light up white as some people claim and appear to have no IR effect, picture black when I darken room. Does appear to see IR from a remote, in a dark room I can turn on a IR remote and see the glow albeit very weak. Nice Clamp..."
2,poor,poor image and the leds do not work and night vision is MIA ... turned out to be just another webcam
5,Awesome little camera!,"I was looking for a good-quality budget-friendly (around $20) camera that would work great with Skype, and that's exactly what I got! I have three computers at home, HP desktop, Asus netbook, and IBM ThinkPad laptop, all with different operating systems, and this camera works in all of them without any kind of installations and programs. I just plug it into USB port and it works!I also like the quality -- it's 800x600 at 30fps, the picture is nice and clear so is the motion. (Other cameras for $20 had 640x480 and that's how I chose this one)I also like the design -- looks cute in white color, and is very light, could take it anywhere with me. Great product!"
3,The Valuation of Real Estate-A reaction,"The Valuation of Real Estate is an industry standard. If you are considering this volume, be aware that it is NOT a hardcover. It is a ""downsized"" paperback, which was a shock to me considering the cost. The type in the volume I received was surprisingly light: some pages looked like they had been copied on an inexpensive copier.If you purchase this diminutive edition of a formerly wonderful book, I suggest you also purchase a magnifying glass."
5,Preschoolers love this book!!,"This book is terrific! My three children have all loved it. My 2-year-old twins have memorized its silly, bouncy, rhyming text, and it still has appeal for my five year old. I have given it as a gift to two other families, who have searched for other copies to pass on to their friends. You can't go wrong with this book. (An added plus -- the child who isn't afraid of ""Big Black Bear"" is a girl.)"
2,GRAND CHAMP,"DMX has been fallin off since his 2001 album The Great Depression hit stores. Before TGD, we all were into X and his yellin and barkin stuff but now its old. This album, which is supposed to be X's last, is filled to the top with so many mediocre songs i don't know where to start. The pop radio singles ""Where The Hood At"" and ""Get It On The Floor"" are sure to increase the sales but there is absolutely no substance or anything here. The only album DMX totally pulled off was his debut It's Dark And Hell Is Hot, after that his albums got worse and worse. Now X is reduced to simply barkin and cussin his way through an album not even worth 2 stars, but for the sake of a few choice songs, this album is not worth it. If this is X's swan song, then its a way overdue one."
5,"Worth buyin, no doubt","This is DMX's last album and it's also one of his best. It has lots of hits in it & even if it only had the songs: ""Where the hood at"", ""X gon' give it to ya"" and ""A'yo Kato"" it was still worth buyin'. Almost all of the songs are excellent."
1,What were YOU listening to?,"If I could rate this NO stars I would. I bought this out the gate hoping for something bigger and better than The Great Depression (which depressed the hell outta me). Oh, too bad for me. X's descent into nonexsistence is going to be littered with wack ass cd's if he continues to push garbage like this on his fans. The BEST thing about this cd is the guest stars who ALL outshine the Darkman pound for pound.If you want to hear GOOD Ruff Ryder joints, just pick up Styles, Jada's or even Sheek's cd's. His ""supposed"" protege's who are a bonfires compared to this weak as a candle in a hurricane schlock.Pull a Cube and stick to bad acting in corny action adventure movies."
3,"It's alright, but could be better.","I was extremely excited when i bought this cd because i thought Where The Hood At was DMX's best song, but when i listened to the whole cd i realized that it was almost complete garbage. The only reason i gave 3 stars is that A'yo Kato, Thank You, The Rain, Prayer V, and the bonus track On Top are all hot but the rest is complete trash. And Where The Hood At has so many bleeps that you have no clue what he is sayin. I recommend you get an unedited version of this cause there is way too many bleeps. I burned the unedited version of Where The Hood At and it is so much better, but most of the CD is garbage. Can anybody tell me a good DMX CD before i lose interest in him? He is truly an awesome rapper but he can do better than this."
3,grand champ of past his prime,although dmx is probably my favorite rapper right now its his older songs that i like not this new horse****. i bought it cause i liked the 2 singles and i wanted to build my collection but there are only maybe 5 good songs and that might be a stretch. he was so great in his first 3 but toughed it out probably too long. i give it a 3 star rating just based on the songs i actually like. the rest of them could of been left off this cd.
5,damnnnnnn great way to leave the seen for DMX,This is a great cd a bounch of great great songs on here for everyone that said this cd is not worth buying...well guess again its a great cd with some real heart and soul put into it because its his last cd ever. I have been listening to DMX sense I was 10. His the reason I listen to dmx and this cd is the real reason I listen to him. He is such a great rapper and such a great artist.
1,crack=horrible album,kids don't do drugs or you will someday drop an album just like this one. this guy just needed a fix so decided to go to the studio.please don't drop any more albums crack man x.
1,Dog days are over!,"This album is total waste of time, money and a slot in my cd book. There isnt anything on here I could just play over and over again. I only like track one and four. This is horrible."
1,Wack Album,"Don'tget me wrong, DMX is one of my favorite rappers but this album, just sucks. Thee is about 24 tracks on here and most of them are just filler tracks which you'll never listen to again. I only listened to this album once and while I was I got bored with it. DMX's albums are all good (Dark and Hell is hot is the best one) but he started to get lazy with his newer ones like this. The only songs I can stand is 'where the hood at' 'get it on the flor' and thats about it. Do not buy this and get his first album.Kray-Z187"
5,F**K YALL HATERS THIS IS THE LATE GREAT X SO 5/5FORU CHUMPS,"X is back and back with avanges with songs like f**k yall Ni**as and where da hood at this cd is one of the greats of x's collection,not the best but great the hood shouts out 5 stars while he is still the grand champion in rap1!!!!!!!!!"
4,The Roads of Texas,"As an experienced backwoods traveler, I have logged more than 15,000 miles in back roads travels in Texas in the last 4 years. My wife and I do it for our hobby. Althought the Roads of Texas is not 100% accurate, it is the best I have found, and I can promise you, I go places, no one else wants to; to the very isolated old ghost towns, cemeteries, etc. Roads of Texas is usually very very accurate in pinpointing a location. If you want to travel the isolated Farm to Market roads of Texas, this is the book to have."
5,Roads of Texas,"You know all those times you are traveling and wonder where a certain road leads, but it isn't on the usual map? This book shows every road, so you can find it easily and stop wondering. Keep in mind that they aren't all named, but every street, road, Farm Road, lane, avenue, etc. is in this book. You can't beat it."
5,belt tensioner,"I was chasing a noise in my wife's corolla & this item fixed that vibration straight away ,once fitted. I had made several attempts to sort this before, all to very little success. I think maybe I am back in the good books , so to speak, Dave."
5,"A response to the ""Drugstore Cowboy"" review of ""Junky""","Junky was written 40 years before Drugstore Cowboy was released. To lable Junky as ""another shoot 'em up book"" is dismissive and unwarranted. Junky was and is the first book of its kind. I'm certain Gus Van Sant realized this as well when he cast William S. Burroughs in Drugstore Cowboy. When you read ""another shoot 'em up book"", realize that these other pieces exist because Burroughs had the knowledge and the courage to write a piece this bold and in doing so, paved the way for other herion related works that might not have been published or released as films otherwise."
4,junky:great book for all,i would just like to say bottom line that junky is a great book. its a shot of reality that i think all should know. anyone who could read this book then turn to the needle is seriously wrong in the mind in the first place. unfortunately where i live the book is rather blacklisted as a bad influence on kids but i'm 17 and read it and i think that its a great book for anyone age 16-90
5,Almost as good as Burgess,One of the few books I have been able to read in years. I do not know of any other writer who has done as much with language as Mr. Burroughs has done here-The fact that this is also a very funny book may pass unnoticed-
4,Well enough,"I liked this book very much, I was surprised at the heroin addiction in the 1950's. I bought this book because the author was inspirational to Hunter S. Thompson. I would highly recommend it."
3,Never Has The Drug Culture Been More Dreary,"Burroughs' memoir of his days as a Beat-era heroin user among fellow heroin users is sickening and depressing. For its realism it deserves more stars than the three I'm giving it but it was mentally corrosive to the point I can't like what I read. How I finished this at eighteen beats me today. The mid-last-century drug scene was a place of living death and deterioration of the mind, body, and soul. No high, no experience, no act of social rebellion, nothing heroin can give or represent can be worth what the junky lifestyle takes out of a person and makes the user become. True some genetically cursed with the addictive brain seek out chemical highs like an infant reaching for its mother, but others drift into narcotic addiction because they perceive it as glamorous, and THAT is the terrifying side to Burroughs' story of uttery lost human beings rotting in self-imposed damnation."
4,"Cat lovers, take note!","Warm, homey illustrations that almost seem to glow are paired nicely with the sweet storyline. As always, James Herriott knows his animals, and can capture their essence on paper. I have known cats like Oscar, who is most definitely a ""people"" cat--he loves to be in the thick of things!--and reading Oscar's story was like a touch of nostalgia. If your little one loves animals, do get them this book. I have a hunch they'll like it."
1,Disappointing,This book was a disappointment. It doesn't even come close to describing modern debuggers. I'm still waiting for a good book to be published on debuggers.
3,Not recomended for anyone who wants source code,"I purchased this book because I needed to write a debugger for Win32. While it does give hints about the necessary API calls and processes, it does not provide any source code and avoided many advanced topics. I was highly disappointed."
5,The New Zelda!,"My brother had gotten this for me for my Birthday. It was the first Wii game I had gotten. I loved it !! :) It was just a very fun game. I loved the way everything looked too.. so beautiful.. It just made me want to jump into the screen! Link can fish, blow up walls, and blow up things under water with special bombs.I especially loved the dungeons.I know I didn't complete the game and get every secret 100% ( because there is this girl who is obsessed with bugs and she wants you to find her bugs, and I couldn't find all of them ).There are a lot of side quests too! Like finding the Souls, or finding bugs, the hearts for life, etc.There is a fortune teller who will help you either find more hearts, or figure out where you're going if you get confused in the game.You can even fish!!( I really did love this game! )"
2,"been there, done that.","this game just feels like a chore. little reward in the actual story. the game is also a bit too dark. depresses me.i got maybe 8 hours in and just said screw it. maybe ill finish it one day maybe not.wii controls were ok, nothing groundbreaking. graphics were a bit bad for wii."
5,Best Zelda ever!,"This game is easy to learn, fun, challenging at times, has fun mini-games, AWESOME puzzles, and a great story line. The boss fights were a little too easy, and the collectible items didn't pay off as much as they should have, but other than that this game rocks. It can last just about as long as you want it to with all the stuff to do. The controls are the best I've seen on the Wii. In my top 5 of RPGs and THE BEST Zelda of all time!"
5,Too much fun,"I am not a person with a lot of patience by any means. but this game is too much fun, just when you think you can't figure it out you do. Its challenging but not to the point of frustration. The characters and music and graphics are amazing. i grew up playing Zelda on the super Nintendo and this is a 110% better. i love this game, a little spendy but worth every penny. the first time i sat down to play it time flew by then next thing i know its 5 hours later! very entertaining for all ages. then other thing i like about this game is that its not over quickly it last a quite a while, i haven't finished it yet and i'm not close but i don't want to either, but when i do its one that after a while i'll come back to and do over and over. great job you guys and keep up the good work.SP"
4,K Leonard: Zelda Twilight Princess,"Graphics, music, and sound are amazing; controls are pretty good; quests are challenging; the story and characters are okay, but a little disappointing in comparison to other Zelda games. It's still worth getting."
5,Huge Zelda fans here...,"So of course we're a bit biased. When TP was released we first bought the Gamecube version. Our Gamecube has long since bit the dust but I wanted to play this game again. My kids have gotten to it first of course - I was a bit worried using the wiimote for the gameplay would be more difficult but they picked it up very quickly and have already beaten the Forest Temple. Can't wait to get to it myself, lol."
5,"Beautiful, funny, heartwrenching","This book is awesome! It has everything: pathos, humor, characterization, passionate love scenes, and an inspiring message. Roger Campos is a wonderful author, and the songs on the CD, sung by Jon Campos, are powerful, and are a range of many different styles. I especially like the song ""I Wanna Know."" And after the book is finished, I can still play the music, so the experience lasts. I think it is neat that the author and the singer are father and son. I am sure this father-and-son duo is one to watch!"
3,definitely used,"bought this book for my college class, so i wanted something relatively inexpensive but usable. definitely was not pleased with the numerous highlighting and annotations - i've bought used books before, but i felt like these markings were excessive."
4,Excellent Customer Service,"Although the Sadelite did not improve my energy level, I was very happy with the money back guarantee, which I received in a very prompt manner after returning the lamp. Also, the customer service was very good: whenever I had a question, I had no problem reaching a human being who answereed the questions I had.I have heard that bright light therapy doesn't work for everyone, and I guess I was one of those for whom it did not work; however, it was worth the chance because of the money back guarantee, which may only be available when you deal directly with the manufacturer."
1,Not what it appears,"THIS IS NOT A CHIN UP BAR! It's a bracket only, and the picture does not show the bracket. Moreover, the chin up bar shown in the picture is not the type that requires a bracket. So it's deceiving what this shows. The company is trying to fix this problem...I'm sure it's not intentional."
3,"Sorry, it's not Celine.","Close your eyes and you'll swear you're listening to Britney.At least the first two songs anyway. This isn't Celine. There's nothing here that grabs you. Sure the Celine purest will say its great, but I'm telling you its not. I think she misses the reverb in her voice as it sounds like any other singer out there.Hey, call me 'Simon' but its not her best by any means and I don't think it'll help her Vegas show. When you throw in a few songs from her New Day album back into this one, you know something's wrong. Sorry Celine, love you and all, but I'll wait until you're over this competing with the young girls and get back to the top of the mountain where you belong."
3,Have you ever been in love,"I don't really pay attention to this type of music ,im more into neo soul adn contemporary r&b.All you got to listen to is that song ""HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN LOVE""""da bomb its so tight ,i heard it on the radio and i was smoked by it.Just go and download it and you will be impressed.White girl got some skills ,i think you will like this jam as much as i did.Not an impressive album but that single is somethign else."
2,Disappointed,"I felt this was a thrown together album. I was and am sorry I purchased it. I have always been and will continue to be an ardent fan of her magnificent voice and style. This album of songs made her sound ordinary. If this had been her first album no one would of recognized how truly gifted she is. I wish she would do an album of old songs from the 40's. I can her melodic voice singing songs such as, As Time Goes By, My Man, and any Burt Bachrach compositions. She is most certainly blessed with a rare talent,and look forward to new albums."
1,Céline goes Backstreetboys!,"One Heart? Adult Contemporary sound packed with synthesized vocals, some not really exciting acoustic guitar accords wrapped in meaning- aka soulless lyrics produced by a Swedish producer team that is stuck back in the times of ABBA. In one word: boring ; and reminds me why I still prefer to listen to her in French."
1,"Celine,please,give us a break !!","We love you,Celine,but this album is really less than one star !!We'd like you to suggest you and your recording label to stand still for a while..Otherwise,in 5 years time nobody will be able to stand you and your lovely voice."
1,...irritating...,"When I first listened to 'One Heart' there was, or so I thought, either some dust or other debris on the disc because of an irritating 'skip' during ""I Drove All Night."" I cleaned the disc only to find that this did not rectify the problem. So I returned the disc stating that it had a defect. Well, it turns out that this 'defect' is also disappointingly apparent on the replacement disc. I am surprised that no other reviewer has mentioned this.At 3' 24"" into ""I Drove..."" there is a very irritating pause, however brief. I love the song but this pause is extremely annoying at best. In my opinion it nearly completely ruins this great song.I find the rest of the songs to be mediocre. This is not one of Celine's best offerings. 'One Heart' is good and the new version of 'Sorry for Love' is probably my fave on the disc, but the original version was much better.As a Celine Dion fan, I am disappointed."
2,"Celine, please don't throw your talent away !","We've wasted Whitney, then we've wasted Mariah and now (confirming the trend of ""A New Day Has Come"") also Celine is leaving us...They call it ""updating the sound"": maybe is a shorthand for ""no ideas, poor arrangements, plastic music, follow-the-market-wherever-it-goes"". Something can be saved in this album (basically a couple of ballads), but if you hope to find the GREAT voice of Celine, the voice that you loved to hear from ""Unison"" to ""Let's Talk About Love""...well, you must be very patient and selective between all the electronic mess and special effects and programming filling ""One Heart"" (Heart ? Which ""heart"" ?) up to the core.Celine, you are probably the greatest voice talent alive: after 100 million albums sold, do you really NEED to record something like ""One Heart"" ? 2 stars, only because somewhere, for few minutes, something reminded me what could be a CD by Celine Dion."
3,Bathing In a see of love,"well i'm a long time celine listiner first time buyer and i can say free and easy that, . People are to caught up in the whole trl popular chart, sales figures wars, its good to hear an album which dose not care about how it sells and is made to reflect the beautiful medium of music. This is a bold step for celin and though you may not agree with it you have to respect her courage, yes her courage, as see follows her heath and not sucess."
4,"Good job, Celine!","I was afriad this would sound like a rush-job, since it came out so soon after ""A New Day"", but it's better than the last CD overall! My favorite is ""Stand By Your Side"", but there are no dud songs on here-"
2,"More money, Celine?","There are a few songs on here that are good. I love ""I Drove All Night"". It was why I bought the CD. But the rest are mediocre at best. And reusing songs from your last CD!?!? It reeks of ""give me all your money and I'll placate you with whatever I have in my junk drawer"". Don't get me wrong - Celine is a phenomenal performer and I love most of her stuff. But this CD was thrown together with mostly leftovers and repeats. Save yourself the money. Pay to download the two or three good songs and skip the garbage on the rest. This is my least played CD I have bought from her."
4,Celine's new CD,"I wasn't as impressed by this as her other CD's---some really good songs, but others seemed repetitive sounds to past music. I love Celine and her music, but this one didn't grab me like her previous CD's."
5,ONE HEART is ONE FINE album!,"I believe this is Celine's best piece of work since ""Falling Into You"". I think Celine's voice sounds so comfortable and relaxed on this album. This album doesn't have as many ""chest pounding"" ballads as her past albums, and it is a new style for her. I will have to say I love her new style, and she should definitely earn a new crowd of fans with this new style. Every song on this album has a very happy theme. I especially like the song ""Naked"", as it has a very unique sound to it. I would definitely recommend buying this album. You will not be disappointed."
3,"oh,this is tough.........................................","Okay,let me start by saying ""my heart will go on"" was the first song by celine dion I ever heard (or noticed mabye)and I instantly fell in love with it,ever since then I have had a love for her voice and music that I basically keep under wraps,no one in my family like her,so it's a guilty pleasure for me.Well,I saw this CD in ""Value village"" for 1.99 (that's right,two dollars) and bought it and of course found out it was definalty worth every penny.now don't get me wrong,I love this CD and I listen to it quite often but I don't think it deserves 5 stars or even 4.First of all Idon't really think it's very creative I find most of it to be a little slow or blase.But that doesn't mean I don't listen to it,it just means I don't think it's a masterpiece.and that stupid chrysler logo.........................."
3,"great album, but?","this album is a great, but it has songs that were on the last album. this album should of been named Redux. i feel cheated!!!"
1,bring back celine dion!!!!!,"ived been a celine dion fan for years but this album disappointed me.first,some of the previous tracks e.g.sorry for love & have u ever been in love were recycled on this album...2nd, what is the chrysler logo for???3rd, love is all we need???what is that song doing on her album???4th, max martin and rami are good BUT its better if the songs that they wrote would be sung by teen pop stars.they should give the ultimate diva ultimate diva songs!?!bring back dianne warren and david foster!and bring back my DIVA!!!!"
3,Good,"This album is good. I like the songs but not each of them. This album isn't a classic, because here are some disco techno drums."
4,Music Powerhouse,"This work is not one of her best; but still deserving of a spot in anyone's collection. This CD sounds as if Celine has tried to adapt her style to the new trends in music (techno comes to mind). Her voice is as strong as ever, and there are songs on the CD that remind you of the ""classic"" Celine."
1,Ripped-Off In A Cell,Don't purchase this dvd. The matches were so boring that even the crowd fell asleep.
4,very useful book for the adult as well as children,"Recently i read this book. Firstly i bought it for my little sister, but on reading i found that my mind has been healing gradually.Generally speaking, it's fact that 'feeling' is ignored. Although our feeling is hurted, try to get away from it or calm down for oneself. But i realize that it may cause to be some problems for me. Hurted feelings absolutely have to be solved. someone who be same to me need to read this book."
5,We Call Him 'Turaffe',"My girlfriend gave me this companion with long legs and plump peds the day we said ""I love you"" to each other and shared our first passionate kiss. From there, he has proven an intrepid traveler and mascot for our relationship from SF to LA on a surf trip, Tahoe for snowboarding, to NY, London, and soon to Jakarta and Bali, Inonesia. He is adored by all races and is a sort of peacemaker as children from Pakistan and my own nieces (CA natives) have eagerly embraced and held him. Because of his long legs, he makes a great dancer on the Easter table with my nieces utterly enthralled (much laughter and shouting). I feel very sentimentally attached to the little guy, and could not have imagined a more loveable, huggable mascot. Because of his long giraffe-like leg combined with turle shell and colouring, we have affectionately named him 'Turaffe.'12"" TURTLE FUNNY FEET"
5,Beautiful!,"This is one of the most beautiful dolls I have ever seen. Certainly one of the prettiest in the Holiday Collection. Got it in perfect condition earlier than I ever expected. Wonderful doll, wonderful service. Purchase her, you won't be dissapointed!"
2,thinsulate is a joke,"I work in a freezer full of frozen foods where the temp is consistantly 10 degrees fahrenheit. after 20 minutes with these gloves on plus a polypropelyne glove liner my fingers had already started getting numb.the padding around the fingers to keep them insulated is nonexistant.I like the dexterity and the grip from these gloves. That's about it.for 49.99 though, I think the average person would be better off buying an extra large ski glove from walmart and layering that up with glove liners to keep warm during work."
5,excellent formula,"I have used this formula from Phyto Therapy for more than 10 years. I reach for it at the first sign of bladder discomfort and it is very effective. As an herbalist ( MS Nutrition ), I can tell you that it contains both diuretic and anti bacterial herbs which are combined with cranberry for a multi faceted approach to bladder problems."
3,Too dry and abstruse!,"Lord Peter maintains his affable yet enigmatic persona in this installment of the series. The mystery is set in an artist colony in Scotland where Lord Peter is vacationing. Fishing is one of the big attractions of this region as are the wonderful vistas. One of the characters comments that everyone in the village either paints or fishes.Unfortunately this particular installment gets a little dry. Not only does Sayers provide page after page of phonetic spelling of the Scottish accent which is at first amusing then tedious to read, she has the characters provide multiple theories of how the murder was done. Again at first interesting but after a while tedious. Also, the endless recitation of the train schedules was part of the action.There are the usual elegant and amusing Lord Peter moments but not enough to get over the desert of detail. Would be much stronger with some serious editing."
3,"Oh, the Headache!","I'm a Dorothy Sayers fan, but I think this novel does not work. At all! Lord Peter Wimsey is in Scotland, investigating a murder. There appear to be five, or perhaps six, suspects, hence the title (five of them sending Wimsey off on a false trail). The suspects' alibis involve being out of town, train schedules, and the like. Lots and lots of time tables. Too many. And: Sayers writes this novel in her approximation of a Scots dialect, with lots of ""nae"" and ""brae"" and other Scottish words. These are acceptable and readable. But all the dialect words with contractions are neither acceptable nor readable. Many times I thought of putting this book down, just because it was so uninteresting. But I did persevere and finish the book. This is for the die-hard Sayers fan only."
3,la fuente es muy pequeña,"Doy solo tre de las estrellas para éste. Quisa la fuente es solo tres puntos o menos. Pero es bueno diccionario menos éste. Antes este diccionario, uso españo-ingles diccionario pero no tiene muchas palabras para compro este diccionario."
3,Good but BAD hosts...(Maria LOOKS FAT),"Like most, I was excited about this set. I jumped at the chance to watch one of the GREATEST wrestlers of all time in action. What I came up with are mixed reviews.The matches are good. The subject matter is captivating, in ring. But outside there's no personal insight. You don't get to know anything about the actual MAN. WWE did the same for the Edge too. You would have thought they learned their lesson.And then to top it off, we get Matt Striker and what appears to be an outta shape Maria Ka-sumthin on mic. lol I'm sure maybe it was the dress. But she looked like she had a pouch.The WWE repeat what you did for the McMahon and Cena dvd cause that's the BEST style EVERY time. ;)"
1,complete garbage,"No documentary, Matt Striker and Maria as hosts to the dvd. Might as well of had Gold Dust and Doink the clown instead. Macho Man lost alot of these matches on this dvd. This dvd is an insult to all fans of wrestling. Randy Savage is a top 5 wrestler of all time, and gets no respect by the makers of this dvd. Not one interview was done with Randy Savage, or any past or present wrestlers. I am done watching wwe. I am done buying any wwe products. As a life long wrestling fan I will only watch TNA. WWE has turned there back on all there older fans. Since WWF became WWE it has bean a long slow decline in quality of programming and talent. Bring back Bobby the brain Heenan. RIP ECW."
1,Very disappointing,"I was very exited when I heard the WWE was finally going to release a Macho Man DVD. I had the release date on my calendar and bought it the day it came out. Wow...what a disappointment. No story at all, no interviews with Randy Savage or any other wrestlers. The commentary by Maria and Striker is horrible, and in my opinion is an insult. The set looks like something a high school kid would put together in his basement. The collection of matches is the only reason I gave my rating one star. However, I don't buy these DVD's for the matches; I buy them for the documentary of the wrestler's life and the interviews. For example, Curt Henning, Bret Hart, both were well done. I would not recommend this unless the buyer is simply looking for a collection of matches."
2,Centennial audio (abridged),"The title says it all with the word ""abridged."" After reading and tremendously enjoying the rich story line of the book years ago, I thought I would just like to go back and quickly visit the characters. The abridged audio is more of a synopsis with much of James Michener's prose lost to the cutting floor. If you have never read "" Centennial"", this quick listen might entice you to go ahead and start the readathon typical of one of my favorite authors. Buy the book!"
5,Michener doesn't disappoint,"This is the 8th Michener book I've read, and they're all good books. Always well researched and entertaining. This one concerns the fictional town of Centennial, Colorado, and like most books written by Michener, start with the formation of mountains and animal life at the beginning of time, and later focuses on a few families and their extended family trees throughout the ages. He wonderfully illustrates the influences of the many cultures that make up the heart of America, using this one fictional town only as an example. A long read at over 900 pages, but worthwhile.(If you want, though, you can skip the second chapter about the land forming and dinosaurs wandering over the earth... It's pretty dull and has little bearing on the rest of the book.)"
3,"One movie is pretty good, the other sucks","""If You Believe,"" starring a very young Hayden Panetierre in dual roles, is an entertaining little picture, although not really a Christmas movie so much (parts of it are set during the Christmas season but labeling it a Christmas movie is a stretch). It has a very rushed ending but other than that is very watchable made-for-TV fare.""A Different Kind of Christmas,"" with Shelley Long as a ladder-climbing attorney, feels even less Christmas-y and is at points pretty depressing and mean-spirited.I wouldn't recommend either for holiday fare, which is what I had been seeking when I bought them."
5,If You Believe - Christmas Favorite,"I enjoy ""If You Believe"" very much and had a ""bootleg"" copy, that wasn't too great, but watchable. Was very happy to see it finally released on DVD, but the second movie isn't one I particularly enjoy and wasn't needed. However, the price was right, so what the heck. The picture is great and I can watch it without commercials!"
2,Truly Film Noir?,"Being true film buffs, we purchased this set for the Holidays. During the viewing of at least two of the selections - we kept looking at each other saying: Is this really Film Noir? ""The Big Heat"" was terrific, ""The Lineup"" was also very good and we had seen it on Turner Classics. Then it went downhill from there. ""5 Against the House"" was a bizarre take on Film Noir, but watching Guy Madison (Wild Bill Hickock) was fun. ""Murder by Contract"" - B movie all the way. I'm sure I must have seen this at the drive in sometime in the early 60's. Poor acting. Good golly - the actresses were just AWFUL! And it took hours to get the dreadful music (mandolin/guitar) out of my head. We haven't watched the ""Sniper"" yet. A bit afraid of wasting another evening."
3,DAMN THEY REALLY THINK THIS GUY CAN SING?,"THE MUSIC SEEMED REAL TIGHT.HOWEVER THE DAMN SINGER REALLY COULD USE SOME SINGING LESSONS.AND WHATS WITH THE PENTAGRAMS IN THE COVER?I THOUGHT HEAVY METAL BANDS USED THEM?WELL ALL IN ALL I SAY START LOOKING FOR ANEW SINGER BECAUSE THIS ONE SEEMS LIKE A DEAD BIRD TRYING TO HIS HARDEST.DONT QUIT YOURE DAY JOB PAL.HOWEVER THE MUSIC IS WELL DONE.GOOD LUCK WITH THE NEXT STEP.""FINDING A NEW SINGER."
2,Even My Winchester 94 looks BORED,"A few fine old pictures of antique patent drawings & some old folklore about mining in general.part on obtaining potassium nitrate, aka SALTPETER, from compost heaps and ashes is interesting. The brief part on how some countries, such as Sweden, once required the crystalized leachings from such sources as a portion of yearly taxes. The two other ingredients of gunpowder- charcoal &@ sulfur make up the remainder of the book. The most tedious part of the book in the smallest proportion of gunpowder, sulfur, written in an over technical pseudo type style. One moment seeming like an inorganic chemistry text, the next like some turn of the century report from the US BUREAU OF MINES. Nowhere is the fascinating history of gunpowder explained indepth...nor the reader taken on a tour of the GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY that such a history entails."
4,"'N Sync Rules, though the CD sucked a bit.","I bought my CD in a store, and i was glad when it said that it had a re-mix. But when i listened, no re-mix at all. I loved it when it had the music video and an interview video on it, though. So, if you can stand no re-mix, buy this now!!!!!"
1,This is a waist of tyme.,I promiss you your money back for a crappy CD just E-Mail me and I will send you $10.I am very sorry for putting out a piece of crap like this Lance Bass
5,I really loved this cd,i really loved this cd.It was the best ive ever heard.I LOVE U CHRIS AND N*CYNC I LUV CHRIS I LUV CHRIS I LUV CHRIS I LUV CHRIS I LUV CHRIS I LUV CHRIS!!!LUV ALWAYS CRYSTAL
5,This is the most beautiful song!!!,"This single is great. The extra interview footage on the enhanced part is so cute!(even though it's the same stuff from the 'N The Mix video) The live version of ""Sailing"" is great. I absolutely love 'N Sync! They are so incredible!"
4,extractor base set,"Irwin Industrial Tools 394001 Bolt-Grip Bolt Extractor Base Set, 5-PieceI was looking for another product and reviews of this suggested they might be superior. Found these to perform as advertised extracting some seriously rounded bolts (managed to round them using an impact air wrench) - performed admirably - as advertised and the price was good - better than I could find locally."
4,Bridging the bluegrass divide.,"Following a Celtic rhythmic inclination that adapts synthesizers and contemporary Appalachian vocals, The Clumsy Lovers provide a driving Rock & Roll bass track and intertwining bluegrass melodies. Electric guitar and violin chase each other for the lead parts on ""Amen"" & ""After The Flood"", as many traditional melodies are incorporated over new lyrics and vocals that reflect modern-day speech inflections. If you like Scruggs-style banjo, then this record is recommended for the incorporation of it into most tracks. Eastern melodies are flirted with, and the five-string takes care of the modal rolls. These guys are country, and they know it. You can hear South Carolina all over this record, and probably bet your last dollar that these folks have the potential to be a gateway for the older music into traditional pop circles. [...]"
4,On target for the DIY mechanic,"An excellent supplemental manual for understanding, diagnosing and repairing brake systems found on late model American cars. A lot of in depth info on anti-lock systems. Excellent illustrations and typical Haynes hints and tips for the DIY home mechanic."
2,UK JUNK,"This may be perhaps the worst punk cd put out by a group of crazed women obsessed with the popularity of bands like the Sex Pistols, and the Clash. These chicks were amateurs when it came to playing their instruments, damn they even had to have Mick Jones from the Clash tune their instruments for them when they were on tour together. Sorry ladies just because you have the heart, and the enthusisam does not mean that the talent portion will fall in. This time you came up short. Instead try checking out X ray Spex, or the Avengers, or Patti Smiths first album Horses if your into the whole female empowerment punk rock group. POSEURS."
3,Extreme entertainment,"i may only have given 3 stars but that is only because i cant give it 3 and a half. I started reading this book on my summer road trip and i usually have all day to quitely read in the back seat and let me tell you this book is a page turner from front to back. dont beleive some of the reveiws on the book because there is not a whole lot of action and when there is it is extremely good. the book focuses more on the story of louis bastuto who with the help of attorney matt murdock will clear his name from the charges placed on him by renantech. The climactic fight scene is ok. the murder is very predictable. this book is very good for entertainment and i will probably read it again but if your looking for something action packed dont get the book if your into the whole side story of laws and boring conversations. the author did a great job non the less, good character development and good description. looking forward to the next daredevil book."
2,A disappointment - ordinary story and a weak author,"I bought this book only because of the positive response from the former reviewers. I must say that I was disappointed.Madeleine Robins is clearly a weak author. She tries very hard not to use words that a twelve year old wouldn't understand and succeeds - by a margin. The story is the same as in an ordinary comicbook, but this time it lacks the pictures and graphics. Robins descriptions doesn't make up for that lacking.This one is purely for the fans. The rest of us should go back to comicbooks and skip this failure of trying to convert a good tale to the wrong media."
4,Quick-Grip 3/4 pipe clamp,These are great clamps but I purchased them because they no longer make the PowerPress clamps that are awesome!I was really disappointed to learn they had discontinued the PowerPress. Wish I'd bought several when they were still available.
1,Forget These,"... the ""Sure-Foot Aluminum Bar Clamps [from Rockler] are vastly superior [AND CHEAPER]. No more heavy and clumsy piping for me!"
5,Makes you think,"What nineteen or twenty eight year old sitting in the baraacks doesn't think I could do that. Its what you have been trained for. This book peals away all the candy coating and tells toy the harsh realitys of what happens when you don't have your sovereign government backing you. This should be a manditory read for considering this profession. The cold splash of water that comes with reading this book reveals the cold hard facts. Number one the pay may be nonexistant or very slow in coming. Two know who you work for, reality may not be as you were promised concerning the support you get versus what you were told. The stories of narrow escapes are not as much fun as living them. If that doesn't disswayed you then good luck and God bless. I like to tell people I survived my youth, and did not get this age by accident."
2,Buy the Hardcover version,"This book needs no introduction. Be warned though that the mass-market paperback version is simply appalling - the book is small, and the tiny text is printed on thin, low quality paper - making it impossible to sit back and enjoy. Unfortunately none of the other reviews mentioned this before I ordered it.5 stars for the hardcover edition - but stay away from this one."
3,"IT WAS POINTLESS, BUT INTERESTING","I think the book was pointless. It didn't teach us anything or give us anything to reflect on. The reason I did not give it one star was because it was not bad, it just wasn't particularly good."
2,not what I expected,"Yes the movies was fab-who doesn't love Matthew Mc! But hey-they leave her single off of it-and don't even put the versions of the songs in the movie--- It is a good CD, but I am sad that I paid all that money for it.. it was a bit of a letdown...But check the movie out-it was great-definitely a keeper!"
1,MISTAKE CITY!!!!!!,I have had 2 accounting classes and I bought the book to refresh my memory and for payroll purposes. So I read the chapter on payroll first and I found two mistakes in the review section on page 346 on problem #2 and on page 347 problem #7. I haven't even read the other chapters yet because if the answers aren't correct how do I know if I am getting the right answer. I feel like I got cheated because the answers aren't right.
1,disaster,"I received this item in January with a base that had no top to it. The cabinet was damaged; when I eventually tried to use the CD component, the CD would not open. The base also did not match the oak finish on the phonograph. In March at the cost of $130 I returned this product. A month later, Amazon did credit me with the original cost. However, no one has accepted reponsibility for the high cost of packing and shipping a bulky product across the country. At the moment, I have no phonograph, nor would I want one from Kaito, and I am out $130 for returning a defective product. I urge consumers to avoid doing business with this firm. It is the only bad experience I have had in using Amazon for several years."
4,Microsoft Windows XP Power Pack,"GOOD XP BOOK!!!IN FACT SO GOOD,, A STUDENT NEVER RETURNED ITSURE WISH THEY WOULD BRING IT BACK!!GO AHEAD AND USE THIS FOREVER=> GREAT REFERENCEBUY IT TODAY AND BLOW VISTA AND WINDOWS 7 TEXTS AWAYRECOMMEND:A STRONG BUY AND KEEP AS A LONGTERM REFERENCEIF YOU SEE MINE PLEASE SEND IT BACK."
3,Repackage of an excellent CD,"In 1996 two of the founding members of Player (Peter Beckett and Ronn Moss)reformed Player and recorded the album ""Lost In Reality"". This CD is a repackage of the ""Lost In Reality"" CD minus four tracks (Something Good, Stand By You, Sometimes You Gotta Let Go and Beautiful Love). The new version of ""Baby Come Back"" on this CD is not an attemp to re-record the original version of the song, it is a whole new arrangement with a totally different feel. If you are looking for the original buy the Best Of Player CD. If you are looking for some high quality, very melodic music with great harmony buy this or the ""Lost In Reality"" CD. (A note: On this CD and ""Lost In Reality"" the new version of Baby Come Back features a lead vocal sung by Peter Beckett who sang the original hit version. On the Ron Moss solo CD ""I'm Your Man"", produced by Peter Beckett, the same track is used with Ronn Moss singing lead)."
4,This was a gift,for my father who recently took up the dulcimer and he immediately dug into the book and started scanning all the chapters. He was tickled
5,very good,"I really liked this book. I grew up as an MK so I could relate to a lot of what the characters felt and were going through. And the things I couldn't relate to, I could at least understand where they were coming from. Very thought-provoking."
5,good expansion pack,this game is really fun! the rules seem a bit complex at first but once you get the hang of it it's no big deal. this game leaves a lot of room for strategy-making. there are several methods that can help you win the game.a definite must have for lovers of the original catan
5,More of the Best,"Well, this is the expansion for Settlers of Catan, and a lot of things have changed. The ability to build military forces adds depth to the game, as does the city improvements. The abundance of new cards is worth it if for the beautiful illustrations alone. The expansion makes the game a little bit longer to play, but it still should finish out well inside two and a half hours. My only complaint is that in several games, the Barbarians have not beaten us once, they are way too easy. However, this is minor and can be remedied with a house rule of your own. All in all, this makes a great game TOTALLY AWESOME!"
4,Good Self-Help Book,"This is a great book for someone interested in appreciating what s/he has and would like to stop ""catastrophizing."" Great cognitive therapy book for individuals."
4,Very nice quality for the price,"This is a simple kit that I use around the house but mostly with my computers. I like the feel they have. I have purchased cheap ""bargain"" sets before and you can definitely tell the difference in quality. I Just look at the edges and notice that these have a good finish, smooth. Unlike cheap bits which have rough edges and chip away very easily. The magnet on these is not very strong but good enough for working with computers."
4,it's getting monotonous,"Although I enjoyed the book, the plot is getting repetitive. For the past three books, Elizabeth and Tom have been trying to get through to each other, but still haven't achieved this. If they were really in love (which I believe they are) wouldn't you think that they would have talked about this in an orderly fashion by now? Dana is looking more and more like a self-centered, airheaded musician. As soon as Denise got her credit card, it was obvious that she would over charge on it. Jessica is dramatic as usual, but this time she is acting more like Elizabeth in that she's fighting for respect for women. In conclusion, this book was funny and enjoyable, but after about three books of the Elizabeth and Tom thing happening, I'm getting tired of it. Either get back together or forget about each other!"
4,Success For The Business Owner,"The ""buzz"" word out of everyones mouth in marketing today is BRANDING yet when I asked people what they meant by that, I could never get an answer that made any sense until I was told about this ""WONDERFUL"" book.This very easy read explains EVERYTHING you need to make your business boom! ""Many Thanks"" to Patrick Hanlon, I am now in the process of ""branding"" my business with a new understanding and outlook of myself and my work-!!"
2,Hard Read,"This book was very boring and hard to read. The author uses his keywords (creation story, the creed, icons, rituals, sacred words, pagans)in almost every sentence like he's got something to prove. So much of this is common sense it's not worth your time.There were a lot of great reviews on this site and the back of this book made it sound amazing, but it fell short."
1,"GREASY, Grimy, and Gross!","This shampoo is beyond gross. After two weeks of daily use (as advertized on the bottle) my hair became so greasy it looked like I hadn't showered in days even directly after blow drying.Simply do a search of others' reviews on this product. You'll quickly find that many others have had similar issues with this shampoo.I must say, though, that during the first week of use, my fine, wavy (and color treated) hair developed a thicker texture that held flat ironing and styling well. But, by the second week it was so greasy I couldn't even get to styling--soooo gross it needed to be washed AGAIN and with something else!I didn't think one's hair could look dirtier/greasier than before shampooing, but Paul Mitchell nailed it on this one. Don't waste your money on this stuff. You can get greasy hair for free!"
3,"nice, but old","The pics are great in this book, but I guess I wasn't expecting it to be as old as it is. I consider the price guide to be completely outdated and useless. I am a new button collector and all this did was give me nice pics and a little info. Way overpaid for it."
3,Expandable knowledge,"This was a great book for photos and history, price guide would have been extremly useful, learned a bit about buttons, yet having the prices laid out in front of me would have been a great benefit."
4,Finally a place to put my coffee!,"It took me a little but to understand the instructions, but once I got it attached right this makes a great cup holder. It fits all sorts of size cups and I finally have a place for my coffee on my jogging stroller."
4,Decent Quality - Wish removal was faster,"Fits my Bugaboo Bee...but not perfectly. If it's not really tight the cup holder tends to spin. I also wish it was easier to remove the holder using one button instead of having to unscrew it. (Especially when traveling). Overall, I'm pretty satisfied."
4,okay holder,This holder was difficut to get on the Valco Runabout stoller tight enough. So it pivots when push with a bit of firmness. Otherwise a good holder to the stroller.
3,Cup Holder?,"This fit nicely on my Bob Revolution stroller. But, the ""cup holder"" I was sent, which looks identical to the one in the photo, has packaging labeling it a ""Universal Drink Bottle Holder"" and has a warning label to not use with hot liquids! Maybe they shouldn't advertise it with a coffee cup in it. It seems like it will work OK but it is not as sturdy as I had expected. It seems a little tricky to get the coffee cup in and out for shorter coffee cups than the one shown in the photo."
1,Very frustrating user experience,"I received one of these as a gift and must say that using it has been a very frustrating experience. Unlike a standard pipe wrench, you cannot set the jaw distance and expect it to stay. For some reason the jaws always slip off the pipe. If you are working on something that has an irregular surface (like a big bolt) it is fine, but if the material is smooth (like a pipe) forget it - the jaws will not grab the material. I spent so much time screwing around with this that I finally threw it away out of frustration."
5,A must have tool for the DIY painter,"Masking stations are often taken for granted however they make your DIY paint project more pleasurable and efficient. Once assembled, all you have to do is pull, tear and mask. To those who may use this for painting their vehicle, I used 1 1/2"" Yellow 3M Automotive Tape and 2 rolls of masking paper (6"" and 18"") to paint my car. The machine was easy to move around and I had 0 issues with it dispensing the paper once everything was setup. Assembly does take some time so be patient.Amazon was able to get this to my home quickly and cheaper than anywhere else!-Jay"
2,Doesn't clump,"It's probably my fault for not reading the description more carefully, but it never occurred to me that litter still comes not-clumping. This litter also has large pieces and isn't totally without scent. Besides what I think, the ultimate critic was my cat who left me a present on the floor next to the box. Went back to his old litter the same day."
4,No more loose bags all over the place!,"Great product. Holds many more bags than it says it can. Easily mounted under kitchen sink, but had to use screws. The adhesive strips that come with it to hold it up, don't work well. I would put it up, and within 30 seconds it would fall down and that's without bags in it."
2,Unreliable Hold,"I am a big fan of simplehuman products because of their functionality and sleek design and own many of their products. This product however, provided an unreliable hold as it did not adhere to the inside of the kitchen cabinet that I attached it to. Initially I thought I did not stick it on hard enough, but tried many times only to see that after a few minutes it continued to produce an unreliable hold. If you don't mind that this product won't stick to your cabinets, then go ahead and purchase it - it's functional otherwise."
5,Thank goodness for good ideas!!!!!!!!!,Looks a little weird. Wasn't sure if it would work. I mounted it to the wall in a closet and presto!!!!!!! I'm reusing plastic bags like crazy and there's no mess. Somehow these engineers figured out a way for it only to allow one bag to be pulled out at a time?!?!?!?! I don't get it but it works and it has cleaned up the stuffing of one bag with many getting shoved in the corner of a cleaning closet. If you don't have one of these and you get plastic bags at the grocery store or wherever then you need this little guy. It makes reusing easy and I haven't had to deal with the mess of trying to save bags since I put this on the wall.
3,Loosey Goosey,"Aside from the aesthetics and the luxury of finally having a neat way to store used plastic grocery bags for recycling, the method used to mount it to the wall leaves a lot to be desired. I opted to use the two screws provided with the unit instead of the double-faced sticky strips on the back. But I mistakenly thought it would make it sit more securely in place if attached with the screws. Instead, it rocks back and forth and slides from side to side every time I try to pull a bag loose from the slot. Having to hold the unit in place in order to pull one free seems rather pointless.... and invariably mucks up the face of the stainless surface with fingerprints. Handy? Sure...it's a great idea, but for these fastening defects."
2,Too narrow,I got this item based on the reviews and have to admit it is awfully inconvenient - getting bags in and out is a big hassle.
4,Organizing the bags for reuse !,"We put this item on our wedding registry and received it as a gift.I'm a little undecided about how I feel about this product but the feelings are mostly positive. It's very nice looking, looks clean on the wall, and isn't obtrusive. We placed it near the kitchen. The mounting it came with isn't super secure so there is a little movement when putting bags in or taking them out. It holds a good number of bags, though I would've liked to see it hold more. Or maybe I just need to cram them in better - but I'm kind of afraid doing that would mean I'd have to strong-arm them out and that may shift the item on the wall, further loosening it. Perhaps I worry too much and this wouldn't be an issue.I only use plastic bags for my kitty litter (lining garbage cans in the bathroom) - and I'm fairly good about reusing them when a cloth bag isn't around (at work, etc.) It'd be nice to eliminate their use completely one day - or fill my plastic bag holder with biodegradable ones!"
5,NIce grocery bag storage,"Nice, neat storage for your grocery bags. Installs very easily - 5 minutes. Very easy to get bags in and out. Great alternative to those cloth bags with elastic ends that always wear out leaving the bags to fall out."
1,"Not as good as rated, Ikea is better",Bought this because of the great general reviews but very disappointed. Size is not really large enough for many bags and once it is full it's hard to work with. To me seems to fill fast and is not as well thought out as say one from Ikea we've had. Will go back there and chalk this off as a bad buy
5,"Great, functional","I bought one of these for my parents and they liked it so much, I bought one for myself. Stuck to the wall easily and is so much better than the eyesore we dealt with before!"
4,Incident Management for the Street-Smart Fire Officer,"A very good book but Mr. Coleman relates a little too much about his department (Toledo Fire Department)when providing examples. I understand that's the way they do it in Toledo, but in other areas of the country things operate differently."
2,so-so,"poor slapstick, not very funny at all. Plot was ok, but not well done. Only half way decent part was at the hardware store. The rest was bland and a waste of time."
2,Corny!!!!,"Am not sure how they talked Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo into doing this movie, but the results are truly not worth their time and talent. Quaid is a widower with eight kids whom he fathers in a military fashion (he being an Admiral in the Coast Guard and all.) Russo is a designer who has a more relaxed mode of parenting. They have a chance meeting which rekindles their high school romance and, before even meeting each other's kids they are married (how likely is that?) The resulting blended brood of 18 kids has a lot of conflicts and even a large lighthouse is not big enough to hold all of them. Eventually they decide to band together to break up their mom and dad so that their life can return to the way it was before their parents married. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out how this all turns out. The script is bad and even the family pet pig can't save this one."
5,Cute movie,"I think this is an adorable movie that covers it's plot very well with lots of mischievous children, reminds me of a spin-ff of the Brady Bunch with more kids added to the mix."
2,Not entirelly bad but not good either,Here's another movie where you watch it thinking it's not good or bad but it could be way better. The film tire's too hard to be like cheaper by the dozen and home alone and alos tries to be really funny but it falls flat on it's face. The moive has some funny moments and the chemestry between Quide and Russo is real. The acting was pretty good but too bad it cant make up for the weak story. The story is hughly predictable and silly at times. the film is a good family film and that's about it. It wasent a totel waste of time but I would not recomand it.
2,Problem with HDMI,"I bought this last month and hooked this with the Acer PH530 projector. The component line works fine but having problem with the HDMI. It gives a black screen with flashes of sounds every few seconds. I upgraded the firmware but the problem wasn't fixed. Discussed this in the AVS forum and find out that some people had the same issue with DVP5982. This was due to the ""handshake"" issue between the two devices' HDCP. I don't have the same issue with all other devices that hooked with the projector. So I called Philips and see if they could help. Unfortunately, the customer service rep didn't have a clue and couldn't help with it. I think I will return this and try another brand."
4,The USB port stand out from the Others Brand,"I have the problem with this dvd player is the other reviews wish for, both output over the HDMI cable and the digital coaxial at the same time. With both audio out put (sound come out from TV speaker and Audio Equiptment Speakers)in the same time will sound ECHO. I turn off the digital HDMI audio at the sound set up, but it turn back on after I turn off and on the dvd player. I have to turn off the HDMI at the set up everytime I want to watch the movie or just stick with sound come out from TV Speaker. If anyone have the same problem and know how to fix please post for others. The HDMI cable I have cost me 1 cent plus $5 shipping at Amazon Market place (the gold paint chip off when I received it, one cent, what can I say). It work but not recommonded if you can afford a better one.The other problem is the remote have no Seach Buttons. Only have chapter backward or forward button, it mean I miss something I have go back one chapter not just a little."
4,Overall great player!!,"After hearing a co-worker talk about it, I had to get it for myself. Runs great, no problems as of yet. couple of people reviewed it's tray being flimsy. . .It is very thin, but I wouldn't say flimsy. The fact that it can be region-freed was a big bonus for me. I would recommend this player."
2,Why bother?,"I guess I should have just ponied up the cash for a Blu-Ray player because thing is weak. The picture is fuzzy as if you were at a drive-in movie theater and the projector is out of focus just a little bit. You can tolerate but you'd expect more. I have a nice Samsung 1080p TV which has a great high def picture but this DVD player doesn't upscale anything. Lettering and captions look like they have shadows too. I suppose until we know what high def disc format is going to dominate the market this is the best we can do. Maybe my expecations were too high. But be warned. You get what you pay for. The lesson here: If you order a filet mignon, don't drink a Bud with it."
2,Only for HDMI Users,"I bought this model to replace my Philips DVP5140 only because I wanted to play avi files directly through the USB port and to use the lip synch feature for files where synching was imperfect. I did not want to use the upscaling or HDMI features, and I connect through component cables. To my great disappointment the machine clearly has a much inferior video processor to the cheaper, older, 5140. Motion on all but the slowest bit rate avi files burned to DVD is unwatchably jerky, while the same files play perfectly on the older machine through the same connections. So this model may be fine for HDMI and upscaling purposes, but you should avoid like the plague for any other type of connection."
5,Very Satisfied,"I knew nothing about upscaling DVD players until I bought my Samsung LN40A550 40-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV and saw Amazon had this player listed as a sauggested purchase with it. I did some research and talkerd to a friend who knows about this stuff and decided to buy it.Boy am I glad I did! I connected to my TV with a 10G monster HDMI cable and the picture is amazing. There was no way I was going to convert my DVD collection to Blu-Ray, so this was the perfect solution.I also love the slim look."
3,"Works, but not perfect.","This DVD player works as promised, but requires the additional setup/program to play other region's DVD. Built quality is mediocre.One thing that I think is the main issue is the extremely SLOW boot up time. It takes a good 10-15 seconds for the player to boot up before it's functional and responds to any commands/actions. Picture quality is acceptable, nothing too spectacular. However, for the price above $100, there's better alternatives in Amazon. Not worth it."
3,Works for me,"I did not want to spend too much on a dvd player but wanted a decent one which is why I bought this one. I am not an advanced user, so didnt look for too many capabilities. But I did want a dvd player with USB input which wasnt there in cyberhome my previous player. Thats the coolest feature for me personally. Per my experience so farPros:USB option, picture quality, region free (not used yet)Cons:Takes a ton of time to open and close the dvd tray. Very basic remote.Overall good for the price. little quirks here and there."
1,AVOID -- HDCP required (its own definition),"This DVD player will not work with monitors it thinks are non-HDCP monitors. I connected the DVI cable to my 2006 Sceptre LCD monitor that is supposed to be HDCP compliant. The DVD plays a few seconds of the DVD in the background, and even gets to the menu screen, then says 'non-HDCP compliant device' and goes to white snow/fuzz. [HDCP is the movie version of DRM - only stupider. ONLY pirated DVDs will play with this type of 'protection'.]"
3,good for the price,"great dvd player for $60ish dollars. the upscaling works great and I'm very pleased with it. the only reason I took away 2 stars is because there are no rwd/ffwd buttons on the remote. not much of a problem cuz the remote is garbage anyways and got put aside immediately. the problem is that because of this my new harmony 880 remote won't register rwd/ffwd buttons. I know that someday, given the time, I can fix the problem, just wish I didn't have to. I gladly would have spent the extra $10 - $20 to avoid the frustration."
3,"Reads 100% of DVDs, incompatible with external hard drives!!!","PROS: (1) Reads 100% of DVDs from anywhere in the world, originals or copies, DVD, VCD, audio CD, MP3, etc. (2) Super slim, and nice design.CONS: (1) incompatible with most external hard drives. (2) too slow: takes 10-15 seconds for the DVD lid to open. (3) Remote control only works in very near distances (less than 5ft!)"
4,"Decent, cheap, unlockable","Motion a bit pixelated when viewed through latest generation HD LCD with 120Hz motion control, but picture is good overall. Best feature for those with foreign films, google remote control code to permanently unlock unit to play films of any region. They're yours aren't they?"
5,"Works fine for me, plays everything.",The only issue I had was with trying to play divx files using an HDMI cable to my LCD TV. After a little googling I read that HDMI doesn't like the compression that goes on with formats like divx so I ordered some high-quality component cables which fixed my issue. I LOVE this DVD player! The USB functionality was a GREAT idea! I'm planning to get a big external USB hard drive and load it with movies. A second USB port in the back would be a good idea for long term attachments like external drives. I bet the MPAA is crapping themselves over this development in consumer empowerment LOL!!! Kudos to Phillips for having the stones to make it...
4,"Works well, no problems","I needed an additional DVD player (essentially to play Elmo and Thomas the Tank Engine for my son). Plugged this unit into a Philips 42"" HD Plasma TV through an HDMI connection-- was up and running in less than 3 minutes. Picture is nice, although I have not really analyzed that much as this set up sits at second home-- and the abundance of Elmo on the screen."
5,A GREAT DVD,"The Philips DVP5982 is a great DVD Player. It is easy to setup and plays straight out of the box. The manual is easy to understand and the commands are easy to navigate via a well laid out Remote. The HDMI connection is a dream for both Video & Surround Sound. The picture quality is so good on my old dvd's I felt I was seeing them for the first time. It is awesome, both Video & Surround Sound. It would be nice,to have a button on the Remote to open/close the disc drive. I give the Philips DVP5982 5 stars anyhow."
3,"Slow response, but in good price.","the response is slower than the other dvd player that i have. couple times that i turned on the dvd player and started playing the dvd, it didn't have sound, even the volume had turned on. i had to turned off the dvd player and turned it on again few times in order the get the sound back."
1,Utter crap,"We bought this machine on special at a local big-box electronics store, and it died within a week. The picture is fine, and it plays everything I throw in there, BUT the sound is horrifically distorted. AVOID.Plus the disc tray is cheaply made, thin and wobbly. The whole player is made on the cheap, very light and plastic plastic plastic."
4,Really nice and worth the money,"The only downfall to this DVD player for me is the sluggish response times. But, the DVDs play and look great on it.What I really LOVE about it is the USB port. I bought a 16 GB corsair flash drive and now, i can dump my divx files to that and watch movies via the flash drive which means I dont have to burn disks or anything. I also hooked an external hard drive to it with no problems.This unit is worth what little it cost for what it does."
5,Absolutely astounding!,"This little blue box will explode your sound outward, upward, and around you--bringing back missing frequencies, expanding the stereo image, and maximizing the signal-to-noise. The Surround system is extremely good, particularly the Dialog Enhancement feature which works to make center-mic'd things clearer and more focused. It's great for DVDs, but where it really shines is in the music department. With a set of Altec Lansing ATP3s, I was astounded by the clarity and forcefulness suddenly present in every note... and hooked up to my stereo, a JVC MX-GT80, the result was absolutely ASTOUNDING-- crystal-clear through every possible frequency imaginable. In short, it has turned my modest computer speakers into absolutely extraordinary powerhouses of sound, and my $350 stereo system into one of the most astounding... OBJECTS... I have ever heard.This thing rocks."
5,Loving My Woman Self!,"When I told my friends that I was reading a book about loving my belly, they all snorted. It seems that no one like, much less loves, their bellies. The Woman's Belly Book is more about honoring your creative power center. Using breathing techniques, visualizations and art therapy, the reader is led through the process of discovering your secret treasure. Just using her belly dialogue techiniques, I feel more connected to my inner strength. Highly recommended."
4,A Beauty of a Book for Candy Containers Collectors !,"A super, 200 page book complete with more than 500 large, sharp, full color photos. Plenty of background information is included. Major topics run from: Candy Container Descriptions, Animals, Cars, Characters and Fire Engines, to Motorcycles, Musical, Racers and Windmills. Collectors will surely enjoy looking at these great photos. Item descriptions are very complete. Values are provided. A very useful and enjoyable reference."
4,Great fingerwork,"I particularly enjoy the Chaconne. The playing is colossal. For the other works, I think Pletnev was a bit too cool. Whether you like the disc is a matter of personal taste."
4,A Good Live Recital,"I didn't give this CD 5 stars because while being very good, it just didn't give me that ""wow"" experience that makes you want to start the CD over and listen to the whole thing again. Maybe it was the pieces performed or maybe it was Pletnev, I don't know. Pletnev has his own sound, and he sometimes likes to sprinkle a little too much rubato into his performances. I did appreciate the CD coming with the encores on a second disc. They were done very well.I will recommend this CD, it's a strong performance. But it may not be one of the best live performances you'll hear."
4,Olay Regenerist - Targeted Tone Enhancer review,I recently started using this product and I do notice that my skin appears clearer. I still have brown spots although it appears to be lighter and is fading away. This product is gentle to my skin and not irritating at all and I love it! It was recommended to me by a friend who uses it and all of her brown spots are now gone so I will continue to use it!
3,The incorrect Book,"I guess the book is ok, but it was the incorrect book for the class that I was enrolled into."
4,"Tasty, chunky, thoroughly enjoyable","A day trip to Maligne Lake in search of moose yielded bighorn sheep and elk along the roads. The Colins Range (Karen's favorites) jutted forth like broken ribs of some prehistoric giant. To celebrate, we ate Mountain House Beef Stroganoff. It had tasty chunks of beef and mushrooms, and was thoroughly rehydrated at nine minutes. We felt the sauce could have a richer, beefier flavor, but were thoroughly satisfied. At an earlier date, camped in snow fields at the base of Oregon's Mount Jefferson, it kept bitter cold at bay in the fading light. Pack extras."
1,Did not get the amount ordered!!!!!,"In the Campmor catalog, the meals range in price from $4.00-$8.00. BEWARE of the meals listed here that have an amount like $45.00 with a slash through it and then the price is now $5.00. It may also say you get 6 meals which sounds about right. BUT, we ordered from several of these vendors from Amazon and only received 1 meal. The cost of the POSTAGE/AIR FREIGHT was VERY expensive. MORE THAN THE COST OF THE MEAL!!!! Very deceptive!!!! I then had to return the packages at MY OWN COST FOR POSTAGE! I read a review before ordering that said they did not receive the correct amount of meals and did not take heed. The time and effort is is taking me to to send these back is a real pain and I will most likely NOT use Amazon again for this and maybe for other things due to this BAD experience."
2,From Back Cover,"When Theodora Hunter discovered she'd inherited a huge fortune, she became one sought-after single lady. Sudden;y the eligible heiress had more suitors than she could handle. And she was faced with the fact that these bachelors might want morefrom her than just her hand in marriage.One man offered her security her security and a safe, respectable life. But it was Colt Murdoch, the town bad boy, who really had Theo's pulse racing. Yes, there'd been talk of trouble in his past. But Theo couldn't ignore the promise in Colt's eyes, despite the rumors of his less-than-groomlike intentions."
4,Great overview,"This was my Prescribed Text for my Bachelor of Equine Science, Animal Reproduction course. The book has lots of pictures and is extremely easy to follow. I have been really happy with the book and will not on-sell it as it will come in handy in the future!"
4,textbook great to find,the book came when promised so my daughter was ready her first day of classes. would definitely deal with them agian
2,Corny,"I purchased this novel with high hopes, considering all the rave here. I had no idea this novel was a romantic comedy! The hero Kyrian, is your typical fabio-esque vampire complete with leather clothing and an-un-thracian appearence. The heroine Amanda (a blackbelt!) is a silly chit whose internal monologue was painful to read. Tired cliches abound in this novel...I honestly tried to finish this book, considering how popular this author is. But the dialog was too painful to read (the banter reads like a tv-sitcom aimed for 13 year olds..) ""Yummy leather guy?"" ""Do Me Gorgeous Man Man is a Vampire?"" Please.I guess I thought this novel was meant to be serious paranormal. Instead it read like something a fanfic writer might produce. 2 stars. Not my thing I guess."
3,pages are skipped!,"This book was a great read...until I got to the finale. At the climax of the book, I discovered many pages missing in the electronic version! How disappointing. I'm glad I had previously read this book in paperback version and knew what I had been missing. If the book had all of its pages, I'd certainly give it a 5 star rating."
2,Major letdown.,"Like many other reviewers, I went into this book with high hopes. I have a bit of a penchant for romance novels, but I was anticipating something at least a little deeper, and a lot less predictable. While Kyrian is a good character, and the author is very creative, I felt that the book went nowhere.If you're looking for a touch of sweet sentiment with some semi-kink, this might be your cup of tea. However, if you want some depth and more story outside of the romantic angle, read some Laurell K Hamilton. She does it better."
5,Highly exciting and erotic,Night Pleasures was the first book I read of Sherrilyn Kenyon's. I read it 5 times in a row and have since purchased the entire set of Dark-Hunter and Dream-Hunter novels. I've read them all and now have started reading them in order. I never thought I'd find a series I'd love more than the Sookie Stackhouse novels or the Twilight series but I have to say these have them beat.
4,Laugh out loud Hilarious!,"From the moment I read the words ""Hey, wake up yummy leather guy!"" I was rolling from laughing so hard. I absolutely loved the dialog in this book. Kyrian's sarcastic wit was terrific. It really gave the Hero a personality instead of the droning and boring HOT BOD FABIO WANNABE BRAINLESS HERO that is usually present in most romance novels. But Ms. Kenyon sure made this one stand out, even more so than FANTASY LOVER. I can't wait to read the rest of the books in this series."
5,"Good amount of space, reliable construction. Affordable.","If you have an Olympus digital camera, get this chip and replace the puny one that shipped with your camera.The chip is your basic xD memory chip, but it is well built and it hasn't disappointed me yet. You could always go for a chip with a larger capacity, but do you really need to be able to store over 200 pictures?Also, included in the packaging is a very handy carrying case (for up to 8 xD chips) that makes it easy, and safe, to carry around your various memory chips."
2,"Modified ""Earth War""","This is ""Earth War"" with the names of the principal characters changed. Newt becomes ""Billie"" and Hicks becomes ""Wilks,"". Needless to say this weakens the book quite a bit!"
5,wicked awesome,"This is my favorite digital camera of the 4 that I have. The zoom is excellent, picture quality is sharp and vivid. You can't get this good of an optical zoom on this small of a camera anywhere else. And I got a great deal on it at Amazon."
5,Great fabric,"I love this line from DKNY -- super thin, super soft, super comfy. Enough to make it verrry difficult to get out of bed in the morning. Bear in mind, these sheets are a little more delicate than most, because they are so thin and soft, but they're well worth it."
5,HOW TO DRY YOUR BIKE!,This is the best tool I have ever had for making my bike look good. No more spots! No more drips! It works! I am absolutely satisfied.
1,NOT for Black Cars,"In short, I had to return this dryer because it left spots on the surface of my black car. I tried not to dry it completely so I could wipe the mineral deposit spots off, but it was unavoidable to have some parts of the car dry. The water in the San Diego area is not specially hard. Also, it is a pain dragging the dryer around the garage floor, using an extension cord. It didn't save much time, and I'm much happier back drying my new 2011 Honda Accord with old towels.The seller contact, David Bernstein, cooperated in refunding his $18 (as I recall) shipping cost, but not the $32.04 UPS charge to return it. He never acknowledged that the drier is not satisfactory for use on a black car, writing, ""Sorry you don't care for the product,"" and somewhat strangely, ""I understand what you are saying but everyone takes some 'risk' buying online."" His refund policy was pretty good, but I would have been happier with a more customer-friendly tone."
4,Great pan for eggs,This is a nice alternative to much more expensive non-stick pans. I was surprised by the build quality.
2,low quality shirt,won't last long to expensive for the matirial the use for the shirt and this is that so far do not buy
2,Waste of money?,These 'chips' usually are nothing more than switches in a box that tell the speed sensor the car is accellerating which makes it add more fuel. Get an Apexi Super AFC Controller if you want to play with fuel curves!
4,Useful little gadget,My wife bought this for me as a Christmas present and I really like little thing. The USB drive unclips from the housing which is nice. I really like the light but am not sure about the pen; I almost would have rather have had a toothpick or tweezers in it's place (the normal end of knife option). The only drawback that I have found with this is it's size (and the reason for one less star). I'm a bit picky what gets put on my keychain and have found this a little too big to feel appropriate in my pants pocket with my keys.
2,"Couldn't wait to get this cookbook, but","In reading the recipes I was excited to see so many to pick from, but finding products like Maltitol, carbolite, and almond flour was and is a challenge. I live where there are two healthfood stores and neither carry these products, so I ordered on line. The maltitol (Steel's) is $11.95 for 2 pounds, the carbolite is $9.95 for one pound and the almond flour is $4.95 a pound plus shipping. These are very expensive desserts. Aprils resource page, is not the best place to buy, I got mine at Netrition, Inc. I am dissapointed in not seeing more recipes using splenda or stevia. You can not use splenda in place of maltitol, I tried. The maltitol crystals don't disolve very well they are gritty. I am still searching for a better book."
3,This book is loaded with many great recipes but...,"I will first have to admit that I haven't tried any of the recipes in 101 Low-Carb Desserts. The book sounded like something that would help me on my low-carb diet but when I received it I noticed that about 70% of the recipes called for Maltitol. I'm a little leery of cooking with this unfamiliar ingredient and I wished that I had been able to flip through the cookbook at a bookstore before buying it. The reviews sound great and I'll probably buy Maltitol at some point and try some but I was disappointed that other diet sugars that I trust weren't used more throughout the recipes. If I had realized that Maltitol was the sweetener of chocie, I would have passed on buying this book for now."
3,This book was okay.,I have read all of MHC's books. This one just didn't have the heart pounding suspense that I have come to expect from her books. Here the plot was okay. The characters are okay. The end was okay. That all I can say -- it was just okay.
5,a question,well there were very mixed reviews on this book. i haven't read it but i definetly will to get my own opinion on it.
4,Great Book,I just finished reading We'll Meet Again. I read it in 2 days.I loved the suspense of the novel. The characters were terrific. Ifelt so sorry for Molly. Fran turned out to be just the friend Molly needed.
5,My first Mary Higgins Clark but not my last,"I truly enjoyed this book. What a tremendous story. The characters were perfect and the issues and relationships were quite strong. This crushes my ""favorite"" Patricia Cornwell's Black Notice. Pat has gone down hill of late.I would highly suggest this book. I loved the Fran character."
1,Been there--read that!!,Well she used to be a master--now she just keeps writing the same book over and over!! This will be the last one I will bother with.
2,Disappointed,Actually found this text quite depressing. Bordering on Jansenism. Question and answer section seemed contrived and rather verbose; a bit of pseudo intellectual gymnastics. I couldn't finish the book as it became more and more disturbing in the tenor in which it was being presented. I experienced an underlying expression of elitism. Not conducive to the reality that contemplative prayer is gifted by God. I turned back to reading a more positive and challenging favourite; The Wound of Love. A Carthusian Miscellany. My sense of peace and the love of God returned quite dramatically.Thoroughly disappointed!!
4,Visual,I like this book very much. The book is easy understand and to find exactly what you are looking for. Best book I have to find a quick answer for a new way to do things.
5,Super SanDisk e250 Jacket,"My family owns three models of Sandisk MP3 players. All of them are in jackets, but this one is by far the best. Created specifically for Sansa ""e"" series players, the leather jacket is very sturdy and well constructed. The fit is excellent, preventing the player from falling out yet loose enough that the player can be removed without a ""tug-of-war"". The cutouts are all in the right places, and the player controls are easily accessed. The biggest bonus here is the protective flap that folds over the vulnerable parts of the player and fastens to the body of the jacket by magnetism. As with the jacket, itself, it fastens securely yet is easily opened when necessary. The belt clip is strong, yet not too difficult to separate. Amazon's price is reasonable and affordable. All in all, a great product.Vizor Sansa E200- Blk Leather"
1,What a boring kind of music....,"We don't have to talk about the voice of Kelly, she's got a great gift.But that song is a little bit of everything: A little bit of Christina Aguilera, a little bit of Britney, a little bit of Whitney Houston (a long, long time ago), a mixture of Mariah and Celine.I don't understand that. Why is she wasting her talent on a song, which is, depending because of so much roots, so boring.I hope she will find back to what she is: A great performer!"
3,Go with Musashi...,"Though of more historical interest, I thought Yoshikawa scored much bigger with ""Musashi"" than with ""Taiko"". The same intricate prose style that lent a quiet depth to the adventures of the swordsman drags this tale of Hideyoshi's rise to power to a crawl. The plot of this novel is much slower, and certainly of less interest to those looking for a casual read, as well as those seeking a touch of sparse Japanese spiritualism. It's certainly not a bad book, and those coming for a spiced-up history lesson won't be disappointed. However, if you were looking for another tale of adventure and self-actualization, you won't find one to measure up to Musashi here."
2,It's OK,"This book felt much longer than Yoshikwawa's Mushashi, which I enjoyed very much. Taiko, however, I couldn't wait to finish. The number of characters, and places was overwhelming. Like others have written, Hideyoshi's journey didn't have the same sense of conquering one's self that Musashi's journey contained. Dissappointed and glad to be done. I also have questions about the quality of the translation as some parts seemed confusing."
5,Excellent book,"Book provides an indepth view of feudal Japan. I found it to be even better than the author's bestseller, Musashi."
5,One of the best books I've read.,"I bought this book after reading it twice from the Library. That's only the second time I've ever done that, the first was ""The Lord of the Rings"" by J.R.R. Tolkein. The next will be Musashi, another book by Eiji Yoshikawa, another masterpiece."
3,A Bloom from A Barmyard,I have worked with Judith for years and I knew she would always write a good book This One I really Likes Jan
2,Epson BCD Twin Pack Ink Cartridges-Black/Color,"Delivery was quick & everything appeared to be just fine.I have purchased this item multiple times over the years for my C60 Epson printer & I am very happy with the product.The problem I have is this:I placed the order on November 30, 2010It was shipped quickly...no later than December 7th.THE EXPIRATION DATE ON THE ITEM WAS JANUARY 2011I noticed this AFTER I opened up the black cartridge which is whyI did not atttempt to return the item for replacement. If I hadnoticed the date BEFORE I tore into the box I would have returned it."
4,Use Chocoley chocolate in your fountain,"I also love my fountain and have used it mostly for holiday gatherings over the last few years. I have discovered that using chocolate sold by Chocoley is the best way to keep the chocolate flowing smoothly. [...] It melts easily and flows well with the fountain's auger-style pump. It's slower to harden as well, which helps with the clean-up after all the guests have gone. We have really enjoyed our Rival fountain."
4,Good for a small party,"This product was a great idea for a party of 10-15 people. I did have some trouble getting a constant flow of chocolate, but the kitchen (where I had it plugged in) was really warm and the chocolate was separating. Overall, it was a fun idea and all the guests enjoyed the chocolate!"
3,What! No on-line or head-to-head play?,"Great game, but not worth $50. I would say it is just as good as the last Gamecube version, but not as fun as the DS Version. My kids are mad. No head to head? What are they thinking? The GC and DS versions had it. Also, why no on-line play? I would think that they would have added more than just the Wii controls and a new story line. This game should be $30 as they took one step forward and 2 steps back as far as our family is concerned."
3,"Good game, but not excellent","I know that right now there is too much hype of this game, and many are saying that it is the best Wii game, but in my opinion it is just a good game.A first person shooter, but without too much options, just using your cannon, graphics are marvelous and music great, and the use of controls is very good, but as a story is not that great. Too many repetitive things. Gets kind of boring sometimes.Not much of replay value after you play it once."
1,Very thin & not very helpful,Try Second-Hand Style: Finding and Renewing Antique Treasures or Decorating With Flea Market Finds or Flea Market Decorating (Better Homes and Gardens Books). I love these three books.
4,Get with it!,"I was really dissapointed with this book. First of all, Liz and Tom should have gotten back together ages ago. This buisness with each of them thinking the other one hates each other is getting old. And how could Tom not tell that he was making out with Jessica and not Liz. I think that they would each kiss differently and since he and Liz went out for ages he should have been able to tell. Also, when Elizabeth saw them she should have seen Jessica's hair in a ponytail and her wearing Liz's coat. The Denise storyline is pretty good but she should have known she would have to pay the credit card bill. Nick should stay on the police force and do desk work or something so he isn't hurt. Then Jessica won't worry all the time. Scott and Dana are scum who need to hook up with each other. Also a note to the author: Get Liz and Tom back together!"
4,excellent movie,"this is a great movie, acting may be a little light, but the action and story make up for it."
5,UNCOMMON VALOR,I had seen this movie years ago and always wanted to own it to view now and then.I'm also a veteran and believed we did leave men behind. though the movie is fiction it had a good story line.
1,"Hard to read, too wordy.",I ordered this book for a little inspiration only to find out I could barely get through the 1st paragraph! This book contains some of the longest run on sentences I have ever seen. I even gave it to my sister-in-law to read and she came to the same conclusion. I think the author was trying to hard to het the point across and wound up pushing the BORING button. I am sending this book back pronto for a full refund.
3,Does not include chair,The table is fine but I thought that I was purchasing the table and chair set. The picture showed both. I did not see the small print stating the chair needed to be purchased separately. That was a disappointment. I did purchase the chair and my grand-daughter is now enjoying the set.
4,great creatures..........,"Its hard to have a great movie...either the acting sucks and the effects aregreat...or the acting is great and the effects are bad.In this one...i would have to pick the great creature effects with so so acting. Ok the acting is not that bad...but when you have great visual forcreatures...the acting must be brough up a par, but in this case it couldonly go as high as the quality of the actors could. Most of them did a goodjob, but the script did not give them too much justice, and once in a whilethe movie felted like other movies...run run run...wait wait wait ...panic panic panic....But anyway, im pleased that this movie exist, caused with such great creatureeffects possible, i can imagine future monster movies.... I hope theyimprove the casting.Good for a keeper"
4,future shock?,"For decades Gregory Benford has been writing both science fiction and physics research papers. This has led him to author regular columns in Fantasy and Science Fiction magazine on the possible future.This book's contents will be largely familiar to those readers of his columns, though there is some new material here. He speculates as to what forms cyborgs might take, and what the social reaction might be to them. Along the way, he suggests what a lengthy extension of the human lifespan might do to society. He discusses the various depictions in science fiction and movies, starting all the way back with Frankenstein. Of course, Blade Runner gets a mention, as you might expect!Very readable. He writes with his usual skill, and aims the book at a general audience. Don't worry about any equations!"
2,music lover,"I was very disapponted with this CD, after the 3rd song it get boring is the same style, the same tipe of music, I like piano but to listen 45 minutes of he same music is boring."
2,Spectre 903 Engline Lift Plate,Do not buy this particular plate. The stamped corners are very sharp. I compared to one bought at a car show for less money and liked it more. I'm not pleased at all with this one.
4,Good oversize binder,"I would give this five stars but the first one I received was torn at the bottom of the front cover joint to the spine. I need an oversize binder so I can put paper recipes in plastic sleeves. I use the sleeves that hold the entire paper without punching holes in it. These plastic pockets are wider than the others so I then have to use oversized dividers which require an oversize binder - whew! I like the construction and the interior pockets. If it holds up, it will be perfect!"
2,Boring!,"I just read ""Go Eat Worm!"" Which is what R.L. Stine should do for writing this awful book.Todd loves worms. He loves digging them up on the baseball diamond behind the school after it rains, loves collecting them in an aquarium in his basement, loves tormenting his sister Regina and her best friend Beth with them. Luckily his best friend Danny always gives him a hand in collecting worms, even though he doesn't quite share his friend's enthusiasm.Todd begins finding worms in his bed, his food, his homework, so on. Are the worms getting their Revenge?This book sucks. Nothing Scary happen. Nothing Supernaturl even happens until the climax. At least Bad Hare Day had a good ending. But the ending to THIS was just stupid.I give it 2 Stars"
2,NOT SCARY!,This wasn't a good horror story. Otherwise it's pretty good. Stines best books are The Scarecrow walks at Midnight and Beware the Snowman. R.L. try harder next time. Thank You.
5,Excellent Guide,I needed a guide for a visit to San Francisco and L.A. and this guide provided more than needed. The guide was thick and provided detailed information on sites and activities for all of California but the LA and San Francisco sections were thoroughly treated and I found more than enough to do. The recommendations on places to eat could have been better organized and detailed so if sampling Cali cuisine is important to you I would recommend a separate guide for cuisine.
1,Not operational,The unit will power on but will not play tapes. I tried several 8mm pre-recorded tapes and the unit will not play them.
4,Trigger lever,"I liked the trigger lever on my brake hand, but after a little while the clutch lever stressed my left hand. While I have large thick hands, my fingers a short, so the reach to the clutch was difficult. I changed the left hand to the adjustable clutch model by Kuryakyn and everything is fine now. There is a warning from Kuryakyn about the clutch reach being longer than standard."
5,A great album,"I have had a tendency to overlook most bands from the last few years because simply most just seem to sound and sing the same things over and over again. So I picked up this cd from listening to ""Kryptonite"" on the radio and ended up finding a great album all the way through. 3 Doors Down put out something that withstands repeat play. I've had this for almost a year and I still play it on a regular basis. The songs are catchy, the lyrics excellent and meaningful and they deserved the acclaim they have gotten. Since buying this cd, I have began to take the time to check out newer bands and have found some good stuff there.A great album with no flaws. The Better Life rocks!"
3,Good Debut Album,"Three doors down exploded with a pretty good Debut album. Everyone knew the hits Kryponite and Loser, but the disc continued to be quite solid until near the end of it. Still a good performance and a good CD.My top 5:KryptoniteLoserBe like thatDuck and RunBetter Life"
4,Great throw-back sound,"This album really reminded me of an old Athens band, Dreams So Real. Great guitar riffs, driving bass lines, and vocals and lyrics which are introspective and thought-provoking rather than just ""rhyming filler"". When you're in the mood for ""genuine"" music (no processors, synths, pads, computers, etc), this is definitely a ""must check into"" band. No pop fluff here."
3,Decent but nothing special,"I like all the songs on this cd but none of them are really great. There is nothing special or unique about this band. The lyrics are ok. There are much better cd's you could spend your money on. My advice: If you really want this cd, buy it used. There are plenty of used copied out there."
4,3 Doors Down Rocks Hard on Debut CD,"3 Doors Down is an awesome rock band whose roots are in Mississippi. There aren't many bad parts to this CD. There are alot of amazing guitar riffs and awesome vocals that perfectly flow smoothly with the music of this band. The CD contains the hits Kryptonite, Loser, Duck & Run, and Be Like That. All of the other songs could have been hits too, if only they would have been released as singles. If you are thinking of buying this CD you definitely should. You won't regret it."
4,"File under: Rock 'n Roll, The Resurgence of","All too often bands like 3 doors down slip through the cracks- there's nothing particularly flashy or amazing about this band. Nothing other than the fact they play solid music- no nonsense rock 'n roll that reminds me of Creed and 7 Mary Three.There are few flaws with this album, the songs are sonically powerful with all the features you'd expect of quality rock music- good melodies, strong guitars.I expect this album to stay close by for a while. Highly recommended, more like 4 1/2 stars!"
1,Please join the fight against hand-holding rock!,"If you put the money you were going to spend on this cd right back into your pocket, you've done good, budddy. You've done good."
5,More than worth it,"I bought this CD for Kryptonite, but I couldn't stop listening...every song seemed to be better than the last. There really aren't words to express how much I enjoy this CD, even now, 2 years after I bought it. Just buy it, you won't be sorry"
4,Not Bad,"I happen to live in Hancock County Mississippi(where this bands drummer went to school). So naturally when the school discovered that Richard Liles had attended Hancock High they started trying to um ""promote"" this band(stupid administrators). It was because of this that I first dismissed them as [junk] (i'm also not a big fan of alternative music). However, once the hype died down I decided to give this CD a chance. Now that i have listened to it, I have to say that it is actually good. Although the rednecks now claim to be related to Richard since they have hit the big time I still find this band to be good. I wouldn't exactly say they are ""[great]"" like Sepultura or Anthrax, but they do rock. If only more bands from mississippi could be like them. But no, no more rock for now."
5,Excellent Music,Lots of kids like that hard core heavy metal music like metalica or whatever. I don't. I like barenaked ladies and matchbox twenty. I heard this cd at my friends houde and just had to get. I love it. It's not hard core all out screaming. It has a meaning to it and i think that its kind od addicting. Its so full of life. I definately suggest buying this cd. Its totally worth it.
1,terrible,"3 Doors Down is a waste of your hard earned money. Buy, bad...don't buy, good. I personnally thought it waz the wworst CD I have ever heard! The songs all sounded the same or closely linked in different ways. If your gonna impress me 3 doors down, better start changing your songs up a bit because they just don't sound good!!!"
5,An awesome grunge debut.,"In a nutshell - this album is awesome. Kryptonite is a great song, and it was awesome to hear it played on the radio so much, but the rest of the album is just as good. Where Kryptonite has a bit of a pop sound to it, the rest of the album is grunge style rock. Loser is another awesome song, along with Duck and Run. Another good song (I thought it was great before it was released as a single, just so y'all know) is Be Like That, a very slow song compared to the rest, but still very good. It's hard to believe something this good is a debut album, but it is. I can't wait to get their next album. I recommend this to all rock fans, especially if you like Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Nirvana, STP, an stuff like that."
4,Biloxi Blues,"I was station in Biloxi MS for four years. The music on the cost was not bad at all. I first went to see 3 Doors Down at a little bar in Gulfport MS in 1996. They were a little 3 piece band that really was not that good. I went to another concert a few months later and they had improved a lot. I started going to see these guys whenever they were playing. I told the guys one night in a Bar called ""The Locker Room"" (small and crappy)that they were going to make it well here they are! If you want to see some guys who truely play good music and like the way Rock N Roll was in the 80's then see them. The CD is good. I am sure people will be looking for the previous CD's that were sold on the cost. Don't bother, the songs are the same for the most part but the quality is better on this release."
5,Bravo,"Highly recommended. These pans are amazing! If not, they are guaranteed for life. You really can't beat that for the price. I cook like a chef now b/c I cook with what chef's use! Bon appetite!"
5,"wonderfully clear, useful book","I agree with the other reviews, and only wanted to add to one of them that in regard to examples of chern classes, I believe they also use the whitney formula to derive the chern classes of a hypersurface from that of projective space, which really expands the realm of examples significantly.This was all I needed in writing my notes on the Riemann Roch theorem for hypersurfaces in 3 and 4 space, for instance. I felt I knew little about concrete chern classes, but I was able to take the presentation in this book and use it for my purposes immediately."
1,A few good styles buried under pages of useless information,"Learning how to care for and style your hair seems to take a back seat to a distracting, absurd, and irrelevant storyline of four fictional girlfriends. I did manage to find a few hairstyles that I liked, making it more or less worth the $13.57. I'm all for trying a new look, but this book is innundated with downright ridiculous hairstyles. The photos are not labeled with what style it is, so it is frustrating to try and match styling instructions with the look you would like to achieve. The layout is visually overstimulating and chaotic, making it difficult to find simple answers to styling questions."
1,Disappointed,"This book reminds me more of a teen magazine than an adult, ""get the job done"" book. The pictures seemed more intent on selling figures than hair. There are some good tips on how to do hair, but not on styles and step-by-step procedures. I am returning the book."
2,*yawn* I've seen much better then this.,"I am not sure if it was the lighting or the camera work (or the editing for that matter), or the costumes, or the performances themselves, but this is not the best tribal fushion belly dance compuliation out there that I have watched. A lot of the performances were mediocre at best. Their movements were miniscule if they did movements at all. And I'm sorry but fire dancing and rolling on the floor in wannabe Princess Leia costumes does not make for a tribal performance. I am sure all of these women have much better performances that can be seen live or at least on YouTube, but they didn't bring it to the carpet on this DVD. Kami Liddle & Elisheva's performance saves this DVD but only by a fractional margin. The only two things I could tell that made this gothic at all were -some- of the costumes and -some- of the music that was used. That's about it."
3,"Sells well.... Helps, I'm told.","Hi. I wrote this book. I'm told it's now (March, 1999) sold in excess of 200,000 copies...which isn't bad for a how-to-write-fiction book. Try it: you'll like it! I only gave it three stars because being honest (I think it's GREAT!) would also be immodest."
4,A quick but useful read on the topic of writing a novel,"I found myself writing notes in the margins and staying up late at night reading by the lamp in the bedroom and trying not to wake my wife up in the process of turning pages. This book covers elements of dialogue, how and where to use characters, how to know if your topic is too personal for readers to identify with, the list goes on. Buy this book, the few dollars you spend on it will help you to hone your writing craft just a little bit more.Paul Buckner,Author of:Opening Lines For Your First Novel: Forging Your Writers Craft Into A Page Turning Novel They Won't Be Able to Put Downand:From Broke To Broker: Stories of Finding Financial Freedomand:Never Give Up: Book Two of the Finding Financial Freedom Seriesand:Gabriel Jennings and the Ferret Freedom Fighters (The Free Ferret Saga)"
5,BEST NEW ARTIST I'VE HEARD,"REMINDS ME MORE OF HOWLIN WOLF, ESP. THE GUITAR DOESN'T NEED COMPARISONS, THOUGH. I LIKE HER."
4,Outstanding,"I saw Susan open for Jonny Lang. She blew the roof off the joint with her voice alone. Unlike Janis Joplin, she has the ability to sing with a softness, and unlike Bonnie Raitt, she can raise her voice through the stratosphere. Her voice is the best of both worlds Her guitar playing may not be spectacular, but this is without a doubt one of the most amazing voices I have ever heard. She had an audience of Jonny Lang fans, mostly who had no idea who she was judging by the reaction during her introduction, going absolutely crazy by the end of her time. Those ""professional"" reviewers are full of it. She is it. A must see live performer."
2,Just Won't Cut It,"Those critics perhaps have a better understanding of blues than most listeners. Look at the customer comments carefully, and see how many of them say that Tedeschi is ""just like Janis Joplin"" or words to that effect. That should tip you off. While I think this effort has its fine moments, it sure comes across as someone trying desperately to painstakingly mimic the Joplin style. Perhaps this is because Tedeschi, like many other performers these days, is well aware of the seemingly unsatiable thirst of baby-boomers for nostalgia. Tedeschi may sound fine, but you have to ask, ""Why listen to a Joplin clone when you can still get the original stuff of Janis?"" In my view, most of the songs on ""Just Won't Burn"" would work well in a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit which parodies Janis Joplin -- not as great blues for the 1990s."
4,Almost the real thing,"I do like Susan's voice, and I do agree it is strong and soulful. She reminds me so much of Bonnie Raitt and Janis Joplin, but it is in this comparison that her light dims. Still, this is good listening for any blues fan."
4,Sings with soul,"This girl is just starting out. Take Aretha, Ray Charles add a bit of Koko Taylor and a dash of Janis Joplin - this is what you gets. Its worth a spin."
5,Can't listen to anything else,"I first heard Susan on the Blues satellite and ordered the CD from Amazon. Many compare her to Janis Joplin, but frankly I think she has a much broader range. It's blues with rock and spirituality. I highly recommend this CD!"
4,Don't let the cover fool you....,This little girl has got a great soulful voice. I haven't heard a girl wail like Susan Tedechi since Janis Joplin. Rockin guitar rifts make this a great blues album.
2,Hard to stay interested,This story was way to slow for me! The most interesting part for me was halfway through the book & the end. I would not recommend it.
4,Interesting,I really enjoyed this book. It was a great story and kept me reading. I was interested to find out the ending and how things changed.
3,okay,Enjoyed reading this book. It was cute and enjoyable. The characters were interesting and overall the story was pretty good.
3,Fair,"It was okay, kept me reading, but nothing special. I would agree with the others who said that the ""twins"" premise was a little creepy. It was a free book, so no regrets, but I wouldn't spend much money on it."
3,Good subject not very good writing though,"I'm over half way through, trying to choke it down literally. Too much bouncing around and unnecessary information. Story line sounds good, but the writing just doesn't make it appealing at all."
2,Less is best!,What can say it was a great story line but there was just too much crap in between that needed to be edited out. I found myself forwarding multiple pages just so I could get to the story. Very disappointed in it.
3,Good story line; however,"There is a good strong, story line for the book (sister # 1- perfect, sister # 2- not so much); however the book is also full of strong sexual sceens, inuiendous, profanity. I liked the story line, but didn't like having to sift through all of the other junk to get to the heart of the story. It was a free book and I'm glad!"
4,entertaining,made me laugh out loud enjoyed it alot but the ending did not leave me wanting for more but maybe book 2 will save it
3,"interesting storyline, poor editing","Overall, I enjoyed the story. However, there were tons of editing errors that distracted from the story and easily should've been caught beforehand. The insertion of the 'Dear Aunt Mary' netiquette questions sometimes worked, but sometimes felt as though they were placed right in the middle of another scene. Also, I wish the main character had been developed a little more carefully, as sometimes the beating home of a point just became too much. Despite these complaints, the overall story line was interesting and I finished the book because I had to know how it would end. Plus, the male protagonist was a great character."
3,"slow, slow, slow","I bought the CD basing myself on the reviews. As soon as I received it I stuck it in the player and listened to it. And I got bored in the process.Some might find it good for meditation, I don't know. I personally did not find it particularly relaxing. Actually, it got annoying and started running on my nerves. Like, after 20 minutes, I found myself saying, 'OK that's enough! I got the picture!'"
5,Jockeys,"Great, enjoyed this alot. For the racing person this is a good watch, looking forward to Jockeys 2"
2,Very bad binding,"It is very difficult to use this book cause of the binding, the content is so so, want to learn, go with other books."
4,Nice and Elegent!,"I purchased this book after reading the review about it. It matches quite well with it! The book gives nice intro about the origin of piano, history of it and its current status. It also describes the functioning of a typical piano (electronic keyboard/piano works on different principle).I recommend this book for the starters, as it covers the basic music notations, scales, practice tips. May be, it can be useful for the music teachers to teach the beginners."
5,The Citadel,"I got this book at a second hand store like 3 years ago for eiegty-cents, let's just say beat up book. I had no idea who A.J. Cronin was, no clue as to the books genre; I just didnt have anything else to read one night and picked it up. This book lit me up. I found myself asking ""where did this guy come from"" and it was written in the thirties! But I looked into it and saw this Cronin is like famous and stuff.........rightly so..printed 15 times in '37 alone...krike. good book"
4,As true today as 60 years ago,"In this book the author, a Doctor himself present the dilemma of Doctors between business & reputation and pure ethics.Every detail sounds as if it is taken form today's medical world although written about 60 years ago. Anyone that was treated in a Hospital and felt that the Doctor was not 100% with him an his problem, will identify with this book even thoug it's a bit dragging for nowadays way of writing."
3,Good low buget condenser solution,"I bought this mic to record acoustic and classical guitar as well as vocals in my modest home recording set up. It performs ok, better than the Shure SM58 I used before. It sounds way more crisp and ambient, picking up a lot more details and clearer highs. It is not a professional studio mic, but it definately adds some semi-pro quality to my recordings. For miking-up electric guitar, placing it in front of my guitar amp, I still prefer the SM58 though. All in all a good price/performance ratio."
2,Not on par with the BRS series,"I was very disappointed with this BRS. I have collected most BRS's for MS-1s and have been impressed with the thorough but concise manner in which information is conveyed.In contrast, micro is outdated, redundant, disorganized and generally not useful.The one high point of this book is that the immuno section is good. It helped me greatly with our half semester immuno course. Otherwise I would have given it only 1 star.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend a better resource."
5,Western Movie collections,This is a great series my husband is having a great time watching them. I am very glad to see that the golden time of the western is not lost.
2,Not all that great...does not distribute heat.,"We purchased this because it was listed as the safest space heater by consumer reports. We found that the heat it puts off really only puts off right at the heater. You have to almost touch it to feel the warmth. It's hot to touch, which is expected. The thermostat part isn't that great because you put it up to a degree that seems comfortable (75) and it is reading the temperature right at the source of heat, so it hits this temperature right away. We haven't yet determined a high enough temperature to keep the room at a pleasant temperature. Pros are it's very quite and easy to use. We have gone back to using our small honeywell space heater that blows hot air. Seems safer and keeps a large living area warm."
5,space heater,"Very pleased with this product. Quiet, my husband did not think it was on except that the room was warm. We have a very large bedroom with two sets of sliding glass doors over a two car garage. It is usually very cold and hard to keep warm without overheating the rest of the upstairs. This heater has been the perfect solution. I highly recommend it."
5,"As the name says, Silent Comfort!","This is a terrific product with simple to operate controls and a great heat output. With a digital control and mostly intuitive features, this device works well. Be warned, however. If you lose power it turns off and stays off until manually reset."
4,a very good choice,"The honeywell works well and is really silent. It provides enough heat for an average size room. Because it has no fan, it may take a few extra minutes to warm the whole room, not a problem. Has various digital settings for time and temperature. I recommend you choose a time for it to turn itself off as it's so quiet you may forget. Although it's low and unobtrusive, it is approximately 40 inches long, which may be awkward for some. Overall a very good choice for the price."
2,Haven't lasted long....,"This space heater is easy to use, heats up quickly and was quiet....qualities I loved.The down side is we've had two of the exact same ones and each one broke down. We only used it in the evenings in a spare bedroom in the colder months (so NOT running all the time). After buying two....and having them no longer heat we're on to another brand. Buyer beware or be sure to keep up with the warrantee and paperwork to be sure to get your money back."
2,Only one problem...,"I liked the heater very much at the first year. All I need is a quiet convection heater without fans.But starting from the second year, it started to give cracking sound when heating up and cooling down. So when you set the thermostat to a temperature, the heater will make noise all night long because to keep the temperature at the set point, it will turn on and off every a few minutes... you get the idea. Probably something inside is not assembled well..."
2,Most people will not find this helpful...,because I'm not going to rehash the plot. It's been ably described by many. But how many people could buy into some of the situations Ms. Balogh gave us? The man a virgin at his age and at his station in life? Getting all the men of the ton to give back a woman's reputation after a meeting in the park?This author has frustrated me for the last time. There are several of her books that are on my all time list of best romances but in later years it is evident that she's writing to get a book out and not spending time on writing a story that begs to be told.The best thing about this book was the cover.
2,A chore to read...,"I picked up this book because it seemed appropriate for summer reading. I'm about the same age as the main character and thought ""Hey, why not?!"" Uh. Here's why not... I couldn't get past page 45. Reading this book was NOT fun summer reading. It was a chore. This one put me to sleep!"
3,It was ok... not as good as other novels,"This is my 3rd Gaffney novel. I found it difficult to trudge through. I became highly annoyed with the main character. the cliches of a grown woman who feels that she will repeat the history of her mother's abandonment. A grown woman who is searching for someone other than her grandmother (who raised her) to take the place of her mother. A grown woman that hasn't found herself and winds up getting pregnant and has a hard time deciding on whether to keep the child or not.I really really really was annoyed with the main character. She was such a dolt. I wanted to scream ""GROW UP!"". Obviously she would not have heard me.I still think Saving Graces is the best work I've read of Gaffney's so far.If I could, I would have given it 2.5 stars instead of just 2. I'm hoping Circle of Three will be better."
3,A glimpse of the late 1800's in America,"All true stories, as revealed through letters from Carrie, a young woman growing up in the middle and western U.S. states before there were very many settlers. She speaks of living and farming in Montana, and other northern states.My only complaint is that there isn't more detail added. For example, the author might say ""We had to put up corn shocks, and that's hard work..."" but the author didn't paint a very clear picture of what made it hard, what it all involved. (If you've never heard of corn shocks, they are the stacks of old dried corn stalks all leaning together like a teepee, often seen in fields or as decoration around Halloween.)So while it is interesting to know a bit about what life was like day to day back in the ""olden days,"" it would have been even better if things had been less generalized, and fleshed out with more detail. Little in the way of emotion is discussed, so that makes it a tad dry as well.It left me wanting more..."
2,Does not work,"Within a week of installing, lost power to my devices. I need to get this new item serviced, power to the equipment does not work. Apparently the power outlets when connecting the devices (digital & Analog) are plugged in, they do not energize. Had to reconnect the old power conditioner or directly connect to wall outlet."
1,Great while it lasted,This is very disappointing. I purchased this over the holidays because of a very good deal. Earlier in the year this model had some known issues that Monster had dealt with. Unfortunately Amazon continued to sell the faulty model. I guess they care more about money than customers. Monster and Amazon should have pulled this off the shelf. The device worked as designed for about 3 weeks. As of yesterday I heard a loud pop out of my sub-woofers and then everything shut off. Everything except the front panel indicators on the Monster. According to the indicator lights I had clean power and correct voltage but there was no power to any of the outlets in the back of the unit.Bummer!
2,Product failed after 1.5 years,"I purchased this to replace a long owned hts 5100 signature series that was causing issues with my receiver. The new unit worked fine for a while but ultimately two outlets are no longer functional.As other reviewers have noted, there are serious quality challenges with Monster products these days.Too bad. Please avoid."
1,Just stopped working after a few years,I was awoken at 3AM by my powered speakers being turned off and on every 30 secs with an abrupt bang. My receiver and components were going crazy turning on and off. I could hear the Monster switching inside of it. The only way to control this was turning off the monster power. Pretty expensive component for just regulating power surges. Now it's done. Replaced with an APC AV H15 power conditioner and everything works fine again. 12 inputs as well!Seriously shouldn't the Monster work longer then your other components that have working parts?Do not buy unless you plan on replacing it in a few short years.
1,Dont bother,"No matter how cheap you can get this for its not worth it. I bought 1 off the daily deal. Ran for 2 weeks the just stopped working. I exchanged it through Amazon, which went great. I got the new one, and it lasted for about a month. Its dead again. Nothing out of the ordinary happened. Just a 25lb paper weight. I can send it back to Monster and they will fix it but whats it all really matter if it only runs for about a month. Its now becoming an inconvenience."
1,Over priced piece of junk,"This thing lasted 2 weeks and then started uncontrollably switching outlets on and off. No improvement in picture or sound quality over a 40 dollar APC unit which, does regulate voltage spikes, unlike this one. Save yourself some grief and money and just get a small spike and sag voltage protector with a decent quality cord and you'll be good to go. Unless you're running tubes your digital amp is built to anticipate voltage that is ""unconditioned""."
4,Good for what it is - soothing,"Serrie began his professional life scoring the music for planetarium shows. Even though there is no music in space (without an atmosphere, sound can't exist - it's like thinking that you can have waves without water), the premise here is that this music gives you a sense of the expanse of the universe and the movement of the spheres. This is new age music. I like it in small doses - the whooshing synthesizers as they crescendo and decrescendo - all of this can be very relaxing. It doesn't stand up to close examination though. Better to have this for when you want to nap or nod off."
5,Finally!! Jonn's back to his 'Space' music!!,"In the tradition of Planetary Chronicles and 'And The Stars Go With You' this CD lets you imagine a journey through space, etc. Yeah - this CD sounds a lot like Planetary Chronicles - SO WHAT? Planetary Chronicles I & II are some of the best work. I was a little put off when Serrie branched off into the tribal sounds of Spirit Keepers and all the lovey crap in Midsummers Century and Ixlandia. However, even those 2 CD's were pretty good. Don't listen to the other review about this CD not breaking any new ground and that this CD sounds like his others. It's SPACE MUSIC - how much NEW ground can you really break in this genre?? The music either sounds all spacey and junk or it doesn't. Bottom line if you LIKE Jonn Serrie's previous ""space"" music then you will LOVE this CD."
3,It's Alright....,"I use this accessory on a daily basis. The adhesive tends to loose its holding power after a couple minutes and the level starts falling towards the floor. At least I can hear it beginning to separate and have time to run over and push it back onto the wall or take it down. I was hoping the adhesive strips would hold better, but at least they don't leave any marks on the walls.Was it worth it? YES.Buy it again? Yes, because I have no choice.Satisfied? Not really, but I can't leave holes in my customers walls."
5,Outrageously funny!!,A friend showed me Letters from a Nut just last night and I laughed so much I cried!! The style of Nancy's writing is hilarious! His choice of subjects to write about was a show of creative genius.
2,credit where credit is due,"Why does the author give NO credit to Don Novello's ""Laszlo Latters"" from more than 20 years ago? It is the exact same concept, but Seinfeld and author act like it's original. It's not."
4,what about lazlo letters?,"this book is funny enough, but it's a blatent ripoff of the ""Lazlo letters"" written by the comic who used to play Guido Sarduchi on saturday night live. You really can't appreciate this book without first reading the Lazlo letters, which was written in the mid 70's."
4,Spectacular peformance,"As I'm typing this, I'm hearing the 2nd movement, very beautiful, hair raising sonic beauty from Richter accompanied by the rich sounds from the Boston symphony. I can see why Richter is one of the best pianists ever. Truly beautiful playing and the sonatas are breathtaking."
2,poor sound quality,I found that the level of sound distortion of this recording made it unlistenable. I put it on twice and couldn't get through five minutes of it.
4,A terrific record...,And it is still available directly from Green Linnet on CD for about thirteen bucks. Check it out.
1,Don't bother!,"Only 3 of the 5 episodes are avalible to watch on Amazon! You can't buy them!! Only episodes 1, 3, and 5 can be viewed as I write this review. Why put them here when you can't see them all is beyond my understanding. Shame on you Amazon for tricking me into watching the 1st and left me hanging for the 2nd!"
3,#3,"Well, love the book, but this adaptation is my least favorite after 2005 and 1995 (Colin Firth) versions. I am a strong believer in a great sexual attraction between Elizabeth and Darcy (after all, what else could have attracted a rich man to a poor girl in those days?). Didn't see any chemistry between them in this film. Darcy was so stiff, I couldn't find anything attractive about him, whereas I fantacise (A LOT!) about Colin Firth's and Matthew McFayden's Darcys. Elizabeth Bennett is nice enought, cute and witty, but appeared a litlle gold-diggerish in this version. Didn't like how Lydia's storyline was portrayed either. But overall worth watchingPride and Prejudice (BBC, 1980)"
1,Painful to sit through...,"Love the other versions so much I purchased this one with high hopes, dissapointed to say the least. No chemistry between the characters, looks low budget and found myself distracted by the awful lighting which casts unflattering shadows on everyones face. Darcy walks around scowling with a stick up his arse and is completely unlikeable, Elizabeth appears to be just reading her lines and Mr. Bennet is miserably mean."
5,My daughter has loved this version of P&P for years ...,"We thought my daughter might wear out the VHS tape version of this BBC Pride and Prejudice series. Maybe it is not the same quality as the Colin Firth version, but it is the one she loves. Now that we have a couple of copies of the DVD we know it should last until she can show it to her children. It got so that even my son could repeat lines from this version.BTW - Don't watch this version and then watch Horatio Hornblower. You forget time has passed and people change and David Rintoul matures a lot from P&P; to Hornblower."
5,This IS Jane Austen,"I absolutely LOVE this video. I watch it several times a year and never tire of it (I also re-read the book every year or two). It is quite faithful to the book, with very few deviations, and the characters, with the possible exception of Mary, are wonderfully and faithfully drawn. I have watched only a few minutes of the A&E production and was so put off by the departures from the book in just that segment alone that I have never been interested in viewing the entire thing. Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul are perfect in their roles, and they will forever personify Eliza and Darcy for me."
2,Episode 2 is missing,"Episode 2 is actually episode 4. Episode 4 is, indeed, listed correctly. I have enjoyed these old series from the BBC, including Jane Eyre and Sense and Sensibility, but would have enjoyed this one much more if episode 2 were actually present."
2,The worst that I've seen!!!,"I have seen just about every single version that was ever made of this movie and this one is possibly the worst that I've seen. I could hardly sit and watch it! The version with Collin Firth was much more entertaining. If I had to pick a P&P movie, it would not be this one!"
3,Yet another P & P comparison,"I have both the A&E and BBC version of this wonderful book and I have to say that I prefer the A&E version. I don't know how anyone can think the 1980's one is true to the book! Um, did you notice that in the book Charlotte's sister and father went to visit her and Eliza accompanied them? Not to mention all the dialog not found in the book that people kept spouting. Yes, I thought Mr. Collins was better portrayed by the BBC actor, but Mrs. Bennet in the A&E version is a scream. The BBC version kept having to place dialog where it didn't belong because they spent time inventing lines not in the book and then cramming all the real written dialog into places where I didn't think it sounded right! Not at all as good as I had hoped it would be. I do have to say that this Mr. Darcy a was stone fox! Yow!"
5,The best version yet.,"Mr. Rintoul and Ms. Garvie are Darcy and Elizabeth!! Although this production does stray from the book in a few key areas where the A & E prodcution does not, the choice of performers and their subsequent performances more than adequately atone for these small divergences. I was absolutely entranced by both David Rintoul and Elizabeth Garvie. Excellent choices and an overall excellent production."
4,Excellent Adaptation!,"I must agree with the reviewers that find the BBC version truer to the book. The actors better protrayed their characters in line with the manners of that time. The pacing of the story is slow and the setting is not as visually striking as the A&E; version. The costumes are very good though.The A&E; version is a visual feast. The story is paced well and the set and costumes are beautiful. However, there is a more modern spin on the story. The actors did a wonderful job but their portrayal of their characters was not quite in line with society of that period. There was not enough reserve of emotions that was displayed in the book.I can't say that I liked one version over the other. If you want a truer version of the book, you will be most impressed with the BBC version. If you want a feast for the eyes, the A&E; version would be your preference. I own both."
2,Disappointing version,"It really wasn't that great... long, slow moving, low budget production. It didn't even compare to the A&E version, nor the new feature film. Probably not worth the money or the time."
2,Don't put your faith in reviews!,"I bought this video based on the reviews which claimed it was more faithful to the book than the A&E version. Well, I don't know what book they were comparing it to, but it was definitely not Pride and Prejudice!I found that this version cut a whole lot more scenes and dialogue from the book than the A&E version. The subtle Jane Austen wit and humor that is inherent in the book is completely missing from this version. The casting is disappointing and the performances are wooden.The characters of Elizabeth and Jane are perhaps a little more conventionally pretty than in the A&E version, but that's all that can be said in favor of this adaptation.If you want to see the book come to life on the screen, rent or buy the A&E version. Skip this one.But, as I said, don't put your faith in reviews, not even mine. To each his own. To me, Colin Firth!"
4,Much better than I thought it would be,"I saw the 1996 Firth production first. In fact, I got this version because the Firth one was not available. It was execellent. Almost everything was better in this version than the Firth one -- with the exception of Darcy. Here, Darcy is too stiff and unlikeable, but not horrible.I liked the casting much better as well with the exception of Darcy. Give this one a shot !! Although it is hard getting used to the tape vrs. film format the emotion and detail makes up for it."
3,"You want the 1995 Ehle-Firth verison, not this one","This version of Pride and Prejudice is not good at all, except for its portrayal of Mrs. Bennett. If you love, love, love Jane Austen, you'll probably want to at least watch all filmed versions of Pride and Prejudice. But the A&E version is so wonderful that it is addictive and you'll want to watch it over and over. So, buy that one. This version is quite dull."
5,Great for Dream Insight,I love this book. I have had it for years and I always find myself turning to it. And now even have friends who have bought it after I used it to help interpret their dreams with it. It's uncanny how close it really is if done right. It has helped me nderstand hard times in my life and se things about myself I never knew. Even to the point where I was better able to understand things about others. One of my many favorite books.
4,A different take on Afrosalsa,"This CD had some interesting interpretations of some Afrosalsa classics. I particularly liked the version of Pata Pata. Not what I expected, but very interesting."
1,Completely inappropriate,"I'm no prude, but I have to say this book is completely inappropriate for children of any age unless, as a parent, you think potty humor is okay. I ordered this for my son's teacher and one for my son as well, but will be returning both copies. Some of the ""brain teasers"" are okay and not terribly off-color, but too many of them are just...wrong. I was disgusted and wouldn't even let my kids look at it."
2,fantasy or truth?,in Hangmans Curse by Frank Peretti though this is a good book it is hard to tell whether this book has any truth in what it is teaching. i believe it is a good book to read but dont take everything you read in here so seriously. It talks about how these kids (Elijiah and Elisha)find their strength in God when really they find their strength in manipulating people. This book was a quick read and i would reccomend this if people want to hear both sides of stories but otherwise if your searching for truth (or veritas as this book calls it) you should look somewhere else.
4,T-birdy,"I truly enjoyed this book. It was a great story and it made me never want to put the book down. Besides being one of the best books I have ever read,it helped me see what others go through in their lives who aren't as popular as others, liked as much, or some who just have some problems. Also, this book is mysterious and you don't know what's going to happen next. This book was great and a must read for all ages."
4,Nice and fun.,"""Hangman's Curse"" and ""Nightmare Academy"" are entertaining and easy reads. If you've been doing heavy research or reading this is a good switch. Light, and fun, I enjoyed it after a long study program I was in.. I read both books back to back so this review will be seen under both books.I liked ""The Visitation"" better, but all three are worthy of your money.."
2,Good songs recorded badly,"Too bad thee guys were'nt around during the mid 60s, they'd be remembered in the same way as the Seeds............oooopppps........ they are remembered in the same. No one remembers them."
5,My review of Guide Dog to the Texas Medical Center,"This book is ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! As an out of towner, I arrived at the Texas Medical Center and was immediately overwhelmed by the sheer size of it. It is true what they say, ""everything really is bigger in Texas.""When I told my friend in Houston, that I felt like a fish out of water at the Medical Center, she suggested that I pick up, Guide Dog to the Texas Medical Center.This book was truly a LIFESAVER! Not only is it a wealth of much needed information, it is easy to read, has lots of pictures, and fit easily in my pocketbook of the day.Guide Dog showed me where to park my car, where to eat, where to get money, where to stay, but most importantly, how to get around the medical center with out losing my mind.My family could not have survived our 7 week stay without the book, Guide Dog to the Texas Medical Center. It truly saved our sanity. I take my hat off to the author!!!"
2,coffee filter,bought to use for a bunn and the filter is to small it tells u to brew half and brew the other?????????????????
3,coffee filter basket,This filter is nice because there are no more paper filters. The down side is the mess it makes to get the coffee grinds out of it. You have to turn it upside down and beat it with a spoon that is what I use. Coffee splaters everwhere.There are grinds that go down the sink. Not good.
3,Coffee Filter,It's okay but rather difficult to keep clean but do feel it is worth the cost of the product when saving on paper filters.
1,Not good for Bunn Coffee makers,This basket should state it is too short for Bunn coffee makers it allows grounds to escape and get into the coffee pot.
1,Junk,"This is not a good product, a good concept but the size is too small, and it doesn't drain properly and fills up with water. Just stick with paper filters. They are a proven product."
3,Sent the Bunn coffeepot back,Don't need this because I was so disappointed with the Bunn coffeepot that it is being sent back. Don't believe the hype about this Bunn product.
2,Bunn - Not Compatible,"For those with a Bunn coffeemaker, this may not be the best choice. You have to allow 1/2 of the water to brew through prior to filling the remainder of the water for coffee. My pot is not set up to do so."
5,Prescient,">Of course people have gotten bigger in the 20th century, due primarily to better nutrition, health care, excercise, etc., but we are hardly the 40 foot giants Wells' talks about.Look up ""nutrition"" in a dictionary: It means ""food"". In particular people have gotten RADICALLY taller in the last fifteen years of the twentieth-century--a remarkably short span of time--due to what's being put INTO food (chemicals--I'm not talking about vitamins here): not ""bigger"", TALLER. Taller, thinner, less muscular, more stretched out, in a word, misshapen, disfigured.This book can be taken as a parable or an adventure story, and so on, but to a remarkable extent it happens to be a DEAD-ON prophecy."
4,RECEIVED THIS BOOK TODAY,"Originally, I checked it out from the library.Covers composition, palettes, and techniques. Great book with plenty of step-by-step lessons and a ton of tips, tricks and guidelines. A must-have for any seascape painter in any medium.Was surprised to find this book in NEW condition. Seller also packed it very well...a good thing because USPS tried their darndest to destroy it.This is a difficult book to find, and I'm very happy to finally get a copy of my own."
5,L'eglise bimillenaire,"Le Christ ne revenait pas. Le beau St Etienne et les apotres trouvaient la mort. Alors tous les convertis au Christ savaient qu'eux non plus, ils ne quitteraient pas le monde vifs. Alors ils voulaient faire ressortir la croyance prioritaire en Dieu et en son fils redempteur et sauveteur, Jesus-Christ. Ils voulaient aussi la garder saine et sauve au moyen des eglises, un peu partout, pour des generations croyantes et fideles, jusqu'a la fin du monde. Hors des bonnes nouvelles spirituelles, c'est ca l'histoire que l'on apprend des epitres aux COLOSSIANS AND PHILEMON."
1,Junk!,"Had 1 last year it lasted 6 months, Intex want sell part's. All I needed is the power supply. Bought another went out in a month the company that sold wouldn't acknowage me. Found out it was older then my other model. power supply would not work on other one! Bought a Smartpool chlorainator no problems after 2 months and fits to side of the pool with no hoses."
2,Intex Saltwater Generator,"We puchased the Intex Saltwater pump about ten months ago along with the 9x18ft pool and have been battling keeping the pool balanced on pH, copper ions, etc.. The generator is cleaned often as recommended. We have had to add muriatic acid at least once a week and still not knocking down the pH, along with copper binders to remove the Cu. The pool has a large covered gazebo so that the kids never have to put suntan lotion on, and rain does not get into the pool and change the pH. Intex support does not help and the local three pool stores has no idea how to help other than ""keep adding chemicals"". I am going to try adding a higher hp pump in order to more thoroughly keep the pool mixed and not have stratified layers (tests taken in to have professionally analyzed fluctuate from all over the spectrum even when nothing is doen between two samples a couple of days apart). Good part is water is clear!"
1,Beware of problems with these units,"There have been several postings on the web on problems with these units getting a low salt code error which has also just happened to mine after only 5 months of use. Intex sent me a replacement under warranty, but I do not have high hopes that it will last. I would recommend you look for an alternate brand chlorine generator."
2,Flawed,"For all the good that can be said about this atmospheric novel, Part I 'Combray' represents the point at which well-observed becomes over-analysed; Part II 'Swann in Love' represents the point at which foolish characters become false; and Part III 'Place Names -- the Name' I haven't read and probably never will.(Edit: OK, I got around to reading part III 'Place Names -- the Name', and it's as good as 'Combray', not as bad as 'Swann in Love' -- 3 Stars, all up.)"
2,Sense and nonsense,"There are some wonderful sections in this, especially the early part when the narrator is young and struggling with sleep, wanting his mother. The part about Tilia leaf tea is another high point. But mostly it seems to be overwritten, largely without any meaning or involvement."
1,"""Translating"" Proust has become a racket in the last 16 years","Got sent this book by mistake, but I was game for a fresh reading. Like many, I'm not sure why Lydia Davis bothered with yet another translation so soon after the failed Penguin translations. The only one who got it right in the past 20 years was D.J. Enright, but Amazon has all but choked that version out of its selection, perhaps because it's not the latest ""annual"" translation by yet another ""professor"" who teaches literature at the community college. Starthereand work your way through the rest of the set. And please, if you have the urge to write YET ANOTHER TRANSLATION, get a life. It's been done to death now."
5,"Shooter, a great but sad book","This is a great book about a boy named Len that is having a horrible life. On e day he takes his thoughts to far and he organizes a school shooting. Left dead In the aftermath was his bully, another student and himself. In the story, Lens best friend Cameron tries to fight his way out of trouble for this horrible event. This book is definitely not for the faint of heart. The book has a lot to do with guns, killing and just plain mischief. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone younger than the 6th grade. I really did think that this book was probably one of the top 5 books I have read in my lifetime and it is a very easy read for all of the slow or reluctant readers. I would defiantly recommend this book to all of the people that like stories about crime."
4,"Solid info on software testing ""from the trenches"".","This is a good text on how to avoid time consuming mistakes in software testing. Experience is the best teacher around and this encapsulates that. This would be a good book for the novice to learn from. It may save you from going down a ""rat hole"" in your testing thus wasting time and resources."
5,Far and away my favorite herb book...,"and I have dozens. Herb growing in the south, and gardening in the south in general, is different from anywhere else - we fight heat, humidity, flash frosts, but rarely have a long dormant period. This book not only explains how do deal with herbs in our part of the country, it is also a beautiful volume to add to your library, with photos of great gardens, recipes, and absolutely beautiful photography. I've given away several copies...makes a great gift for any southern gardener."
3,Not the Best...Not The Worst,"After reading this latest book in my favorite series I was..yes I hate to admit it let down. HOWEVER it is by no means the worst one. ""The Cat Who Sang For The Birds"" holds that dubious honor. This latest entry lacks the snap and banter of the previous ones. I did read the whole thing, but felt like one does when you see an old friend after many years- the anticipation is far better than the reality. Qwill might be aging, but he still has charm."
4,A Great Book For a First Timmer,"This is the first book in the series that I have picked up, yet I still feel as though I have read the hole series. The Cats are wonderful, the Charicters are beleaveable, and the plot is great. It is a Purrfect Book for a first timmer to ""The Cat Who"" series."
2,Not Her Best !,I was disappointed as an avid fan. This was not either mysterious nor was there any news in the community. I read these not merely for the cats but for the events of the community. I was disappointed in both story and content.
3,Sadly disappointing,"I'm sad to say that I was disappointed in this latest Cat Who book. The letters from Qwilleran's mother seemed to be just page fillers (very thick pages too!) because they did notlead anywhere and apparently will not ever do so since he burned the unread ones! There was no mystery; the character and history of the murderer was superficial at best. I, too, am starting to suspect the existence of a ghost writer. However, my somewhat negative reaction doesn't mean I won't continue to be a big fan of Ms. Braun's because anytime I read 16 books during a 3 month period -- as I did when I discovered the Cat Who books -- I have to remain loyal! Let's just hope this is a temporary problem and the next book will be written by the Ms. Braun we all love. No one can always be a star!"
2,Who wrote this book?,"I have always enjoyed KoKo and YumYum and I think Qwill is the greatest. This book however just did not flow. I kept asking myself who wrote this book. It felt like the outline was Ms. Braun, but the writer did not have her smooth whimisical flow. The story was good as always, the dialogue was just too choppy and inconsistent."
2,Could not possibly be written by Ms. Braun,"Most of my enjoyment of this delightful series has come from the literary skills of Lillian Jackson Braun. Her nuances of humor, her turn of a phrase, strong character development, and the life threads that run through the series cause me to always come back for more.This book is clearly NOT written in the same style. It is inoffensive, very light, but tends to the cloying, tea-table mystery style. Not my favorite, and I hesitate to buy any more ""stories"" from this ""series."""
3,"Enjoyable, but just not the same",I have been very interested in reading the reviews of this book. I agree that The Cat Who Robbed a Bank is not the equal of other books in The Cat Who...series. It lacked the depth and descriptive prose of the previous novels. The one sentence paragraphs became tedious at times. It is almost as if this book was written by someone else. Perhaps someone else was ghost writing this book for Ms. Jackson-Braun?
3,"Worth reading for ""Cat Who"" fans, otherwise, skip it","I think I've read all the ""Cat Who"" books, and although this one was better than the previous one, these books seem to have lost their charm -- the characters have become wooden and predictable. Still, these books are such short, easy reads, it is worth it for longtime fans to keep current on the characters. I am hoping that the introduction of Qwill's mother's past might provide fodder for a more interesting Qwill."
2,How sad...,"I have been reading this series forever, and I think it's about time for the publisher to admit that Ms. Braun is no longer writing the series, or if she is still writing (which is highly unlikely considering the time frame of the entire series) she is being aided by a ghostwriter. There is no possible way that this book could have been written by the same author who was writing the series five years ago. Very boring and cluttered with detail. Those of us who have come to know ""Qwill"" and his two cats feel a great loss within the pages of this book- their personality, humor, and warmth. To me, the ""clue"" that Braun is no longer involved in the series was when, in THE CAT WHO ROBBED A BANK, the cats stopped being Qwilleran's respected roomates and became instead his demanding pets. How truly sad :("
5,Just as promised,"I was concerned about buying my book from this vendor because the advertised price was so much cheaper than others listed. I emailed them and they assured me the book was new, and that the price was accurate. So I took a leap of faith and ordered it, and - Surprise! - they were telling the truth. The book was delivered quickly, wrapped very well, and in excellent condition. I couldn't be happier."
4,Someone has to be King of the Blues Guitar,"Thats right and his name is Jimmy Thackery. This album is really good. It has something for everyone. Guitar instrumentals all over the place. If your a guitar player, especially a blues player, YOU have to love this guy. He is just so good. I want to know when he is going to release a DVD of one of his live shows???? I'll put in my order now......."
4,Basic knowledge with some extras,This is a good book to review if you have forgotten some of the basics or need a refresher. It is really a book on common sense with some techniques to help find a comfortable level with you partner.
5,How to Give Her Absolute Pleasure,"Wow alot has been written about this book. Its a must read. I was a little concerned when I read of a reviewer, to basically save the STD chapter. I found its only one chapter out of nine. Come on its a sex book. We need to keep hearing this over and over again. According to the US Center for Desease Control an example with AIDS presently 42 million people world wide are infected, 5 million became infected in 2002, over 3 million AIDS deaths worlwide.In a year 14 miilion children have been orphaned. 3 million comes out to 9,000 daily. I TAKE IT ALL TO HEART. Most of the women I've been with did not know about the G-spot. Lou starts off about a dinner party. The producer comes back with ""We could use it too"". Not everyone is going to agree but the numbers do not lie."
2,Common Lou,The text did not live up to the title. Eighty percent of the information offered is father wit. Guys you already know it. Just court your woman. There must be better how to text. This book missed the mark.
5,"Ok men, get ready to make your woman drool!!!!","Men, if you love your woman, get this book. Not only with you be pleased with the responses you will get from her, but she will go CRAZY. This book has it all. Lou Paget has been in this business for years, and im very glad that she finally made a book for us guys. For years, she told girls how to please us, and we were left in the dark with how to make their eyes roll in the back of their head. Well here it is.In this book we get diagrams of different girls vaginas and it goes into how each one is different, and how to please each kind. Its great.Thats right, before the sex even starts.Dont pass this up guys."
5,Please Reprint This Book!,"I read this book several years ago--and I am shocked to see it is no longer available. This is the definitive examination of the case: author Kelly looks at all the evidence, the sensationalism, and DeSalvo himself, with a scholar's objective eye. Her conclusions are disturbing and cannot be ignored. If you want to have a genuine sense of the terror in Boston from those days, this is the book. Some publisher ought to put this book out and give it the attention it so deserves."
2,Save your money!,"The first two tracks on this CD are good hard trance remixes of a couple of popular songs. Other than that the rest of the CD is pretty boring. If you're looking for good hard trance there's are much better choices. Some good ones are Tidy Trax's Resonate series, and the Hard NRG-The Album volumes, from the Ministry of Sound.""DJ"" St. JohnMusic for a harder generation"
4,Gerard Butler poster,"Poster was as described but, the postage, seemed to me, to be outrageous. I would not buy anything else with postage as high as it was."
3,item doesn't match photo,"Although the item description is correct, the item photograph is not. I did actually want shelf labels, which is what I got, but I also wanted Binder pocket labels & I saw the photograph & thought I'd already ordered them.Hence, it is important to make sure the photograph & description match.I'm keeping these since I did need them...but I'm going to double check the photo & description when I order the binder label holders."
1,Komputerbay,I ordered this part and It came within a week. It was the wrong product. They sent me 128mb of ram packaged and labeled as 256mb. They sent me a return package and told me it would take weeks to process. I am on a time line and cannot wait weeks to get the product I ordered. I will not buy parts from Komputerbay again.
5,"""Hypnotic and Electrifying""","""If you still don't understand...Read my Lips.""One too many good songs contained in this pro-duction from 1985.The intro of ""Love of a Lifetime"" is electeri- fying and very slow techno. As well as the single and extended versions of ""Can't believe is Over.""Melba Moore put her heart and soul on each song.Her version of ""Dreams"" from Fleetwood Mac is very refreshing. ""Winner"" and ""King of my Heart"" are two very danceable tunes included.In a few words ""Read my Lips"" is to be enjoyed from begining to end. This expanded and remastered edition surpass the quality of the other double album.Previously released by the same label. Where songs were chopped perhaps to have enough playing time for two albums. Although the sound quality is outstanding!So if you ""Can't believe is over"" play this CDagain and again."
4,Solid Road-Rock/Blues,"First of all, Craig Erickson is more rock than blues. He's a deft guitarist, with good instincts and blazing talent. I really like this collection of traveling songs. His songwriting manages to take you to the places he's singing about, in the Bob Dylan, John Hiatt vein, but with a lot more guitar. This is a really successful effort in my opinion. I hope you'll agree."
2,Please send me a new one,"I just opened my mail and found that this cover was in it. Hopeful to give it to my daughter for Christmas, I opened the outer envelope and found that the case has a terrible crack in it. This should be shipped in a carton or something other than a plastic bag. I hope they send me a new one or refund me completely."
1,"Received broken item, no response from sender.",I received this item promptly. Unfortunately it was broken. I have emailed the sender twice and Amazon once about return and reimbursement. Its been a few weeks and I have not gotten a response.
5,Best !,"Revisiting album after 25 years and it KILLS. One of the finest produced projects, EVER! Songs as smooth as can be, Flawless! Solos rip! ""Just ain't enough good stuff.."" Should have been a double album release. They had all the right players and rolling at their peak. Govt Mule needs to cover this jewel.."
5,Will never dread putting up lights again!,"We didn't get the pole to put these up with, because we clean out our gutters when we put up our lights. But these clips are perfect and easy to use!"
3,Wheels for the World,"Wheels for the World by Douglas Brinkley is a lengthy, but well written book that details the Ford Motor Company's epic history and many accomplishments. Brinkley offers the reader plenty of information on Henry Ford, the pioneer of mass produced auto manufacturing. He details everything from Ford's instabilities and contradicting behavior to his impeccable business savvy. A major downfall for Wheels for the World is Brinkley's inability to make clean transitions from one idea to the next. The reader gets attached to one idea, and the next thing you know Brinkley has begun an entirely new concept. But, in the end I believe the author did a great job of capturing the struggles and successes of the Ford Motor Company, while also taking us through an interesting journey into the life of an extremely intelligent man in our nation's history. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the nation and the auto-making industry."
4,Great early Ford history,"I liked this book a lot and obviously a substantial amount of energy was put into research.One thing though.......it is so comprehensive up to Henry's death, and then little is left for the days of HenryII et al. So, my remark is what about the exciting post-war years and then the present? The old 3 volume Nevins book covers this more thoroughly.At least until 1962.So, I want suggestions about a Ford history through the Iaccoca years til now. Yes, we know he built the Mustang, but Henry built the Model T and a lot more was written about him. Will have to do a search for Hank the Deuce material too.And I leave it at that.....should have been called a half century of progress"
5,Excellent reference book for those that still use Windows 2000,Really nice book that covers about everything with Windows 2000 operating system.
2,Nice landscapes but slow paced.,Good start to film then it was at a snails pace thereafter with a totally predicable script. Hardly a thriller more a taste of the countryside. Shame as the actors and actresses seemed really good just a boring plot.
5,A refutation of Calvisnism,"Description: A refutation of Calvinistic principles through dystopic, surrealistic allegory from contemporary times to future history. Characters include delusional tv news anchors, homeless heroes, student loan defaulters, intelligent cephalopods, female cultists, and evolved intestinal parasites."
1,Visual Dictionary,Not satisfied with book purchase. Book purchase was not in color and would like to return book and get my money back.
2,Ew,"This lotion reeks especially after you just get done tanning it smells even worse. I will not continue to use this lotion. I bought the playboy daily mostiturizer instead, much better"
3,Too fragrant,"I have very dry skin in the winter and I originally bought this moisturizer because the reviews touted its effectiveness. I cannot attest to this products effectiveness because I refuse to use it. The only time I tried it, I applied a pea sized drop just to ensure there would be no negative reactions. The vanilla fragrance was immediate, overbearing, and refused to wash off. I was forced to go to work smelling like a stripper. Not a male friendly product."
2,Scent is a Bummer,"This lotion works amazingly, but I can't use it because the scent is SO overpowering. Gives me an instant headache. Throwing it out because I can't use it. I've tried several times, but I can't deal with the headache. :("
5,Amazing Product!,"As soon as I got this lotion in the mail, I opened it to smell it, and it smells amazing! It's such a fresh, clean, airy, vanilla scent, and it is to die for! I haven't used it after tanning yet, but I can say that it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth to the touch. I also noticed within 15 minutes of putting it on, I could literally feel the tightening agents tending to my skin. I did a lot of research on this lotion for weeks, and I finally bought it. IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY! And it's a huge bottle too! I know it says 22oz, but when I opened it up, it seems a lot bigger than 22oz. It will definitely last me a long time."
5,OMG AMAZING,"I have dry skin, ive been using hempz which smells great works great.. However I bought this to switch things up and OMG this smells AMAZING and to me this is WAYYY more hydrating!!! The hyrdation AND SCENT from this last from shower to shower them hempz scent I didnt notice after a few hours and u needed to apply it every 12 hours. This one lasts 24 hours I LOVE ITTTTTTTT"
3,Baby Powder,"If you don't mind smelling like baby powder, this is the lotion for you. It's a great moisturizer, but I am not fond of the smell, I prefer something more grown-up."
4,mmm I just could not put the book down,"I am not a critical book reader, I read for entertainment, so I don't judge a book if it is realistic or not, it fast paced and exciting."
4,Melodic,"Very accesible cd- for western ears- I love many international artists- but some are a bit harder to listen to for the western ear- This album is very listenable, yet has that 'something different' that many of us who buy international music strive to hear- different instruments, different arrangements, and even different language. You'll actually listen to it becasue of the great music- not to annoy your neighbors. Check it out!"
1,"IHATEPOSERS, ANTIFLAG, AND CRASS","this cd sucks. they have turned more and more commercial as time goes by. don't get me wrong, i love the unseen, but this album and anything after it sucks by them. get their early stuff. they sound like anti-flag here except different vocals. it sucks."
4,Screw the Haters!!!!,"Ok first off to all you punx that dont support bands cause they got better you need to realize that when you get to play music all the time you get better. Also if you think the songs are ""softer"" than their old stuff once again you and i have not listened to the same cd. But anyways this cd is an awesome representation of the first cd Mark Unseen sings on and songs like ""Give Into Hate"" really get me really pumped up. So if you like the Unseen buy The Anger and The Truth and make up your own mind."
4,Fits like a glove!!!,"It fits like a glove, very easy installation but be careful in doing so ... Can't be more satisfied."
3,covers the duct tape,I am going to have the seats fixed. This is a temp fix. The price was right. Cheap seat covers
4,Wonderful and fun,"These little leg warmers are fabulous. We have all hardwood and tile through our house and even in summer with the AC, the tile can be a bit cool. these made perfect padding, protection and warmth for my little crawler. The only drawback to these is the sizing. I don't believe they will fit older toddlers and preschoolers as the information indicates they should. but they are good for crawling babies!!!"
2,Loses color,This product seems to be made up of some kind of alloy with a coating. This coating comes off during washing. I wouldn't have purchased it if I knew this beforehand
3,Not for Gaggia,"In spite of Amazon tryig to match this to Gaggia machines, it does not work. Diameter is too small for pro filter-holders."
2,For use with the Delonghi EC155,"The EC 155 baskets are 52.5mm. Terry's RSVP Tamper has 2 sides: 55mm and 50mm. If you want a good tamper for the EC155, this is not it. On top of that, the tamper is made out of aluminum and scratches very easily. After your tamper scratches it will start scraping grinds from the top of the shot and create weakpoints in the puck."
3,Didn't fit my Delonghi EC155 basket,"After reading all the reviews of people recommending this tamper for the Delonghi EC155, I was excited. I love finding good deals. However, I was disappointed when I first used it. The small side was too small and the large side was too large.I'm beginning to think I received a different tamper than everyone else, due to all the positive reviews. The EC155 needs a tamper that is 52mm. This one is only 50mm. I would not recommend this tamper for the Delonghi EC155.As for the tamper itself, it's a great value buy. Yeah, it's cheap feeling and tricky to use, but you are not gonna find a better deal on a tamper anywhere else. Just make sure it fits your machine!"
4,Light and neat,The price is just right and not expensive as other online sellers. Great for expresso machines and perfect for those whole are coffee fanatics. Another must have tool or extra kitchen toy. VR. (AJ)
2,Not Exactly 58mm,"This tamper is not exactly 58mm on both ends. If you use it on most of the espresso machines, it won't fit the standard 58mm portafilter. I measured the diameters, they are 56mm and 62mm. Meaning when you tamp, it at least takes 2X or 3X time because you need to work on the edge. It is 8 dollars, but if I knew, I would probably spend a little bit more to buy the Rattleware http://www.amazon.com/Rattleware-58-Milimeter-Round-Handled-Tamper-Long/dp/B0016CBO74/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1294618208&sr;=8-2If you are serious about Espresso, don't buy the $20 blade grinder and the $8 tamper. Spend a little time to research on h0me barista or coffee geek."
2,It works if you rework it,"As another review said the cheap way it was made caused a seam to protrude and this caused it to not fit in the basket right. It can be fixed with a file, so it you don't have a fine tooth file you should buy one to go with this."
1,NOT DISHWASHER SAFE,"This product is absolutely not dishwasher safe. The first time in the dishwasher, whatever coating is on it, to make it look nice and shiney, came off. Since it is made in China, who knows what this coating is?"
1,les gone pop,"if you are excited about finding something new from les,let me warn you.this is a very slick produced album of hard rock/pop tunes,at times flashy guitar but not on par with any of his previous albums.a real disappointment. kind of like (this is hard to believe) reo speedwagon with a harder edge.i can't believe i would ever describe a les dudek album like that! keep playing the old stuff and hope he records again with the old spark!"
5,great product,"This is a perfect cigar ashtray. Its plenty big and can hold up to 4 cigars at one time. I leave mine outside all the time, being stainless it dosen't affect it at all, which is great. Just wash it occasionally."
1,easily cut,"Our neighborhood bike bandit didn't seem to have any problem cutting through this lock and now our bike is gone. It looked impressive when we got it but it was cut with a single, smooth cut. It would keep the neighborhood kids from making off with your bike but not an actual thief."
4,Perfect for the intermediate UNIX user!!!!,"This book is wonderful for the intermediate Unix user. It does not assume you are a ""DUMMY"" but also does not assume that you could write your own version of Unix. I found it thoroughly enjoyable."
2,Bubbie & Zadie or Santa Claus,"We got this as a gift for our kids, but won't be making it a tradition in our house. And we don't have a Channukah bush, either. Bubbie and Zaidie are Santa Claus in a beard and dress.I am happy to let my kids know about the traditions of other religions, but those traditions should be associated with the appropriate holidays. Channukah has enough of its own traditions, such as lighting the menorah, dreidel, latkes, sufganiyot, and the story of the miracle that God gave us when He helped the Maccabees defeat the Greeks and rededicate the Temple.And by the way, Bubbe and Zaide are YIDDISH words, not Hebrew, as this book claims."
1,immediate response,"I have nothing but praise for Amazon. The DVD which I received is for one of my favorite movies. Unfortunately I received a flawed product. Amazon responded immediately with offers for corrective action. I chose to receive a new DVD but learned that the company had ceased production of that film. Although I had to bear the cost of shipment for the original oder, my refund was initiated courteously, professionally and promptly. I continue to enjoy and trust Amazon."
3,just the start,"Not a great cd. The songs from Stop Pretending are mostly hers and was the real deal for fans of Paula's ""more snot per square inch"" approach. Her metal period is largely unlistenable except for her power ballad attempt,""close behind"". The moxie ep is actually better than this full length job,(sorry greg shaw. But your ""You Don't Satisfy"" single made up for this weak performance weak choice selections for ""It's about Time"" For a brief couple years nobody burned brighter than Paula's beauty, youth, and talent. I loved her in '86 and still love her. The internet has more hits for her now than when Pandoras played live. Paula launched the following bands out of her enthusiasm for live rock 'n roll: feline, mad monster party, rebel pebbles, the screamin sirens, muffs... these founding members got their start with Paula, and yes mainly because they ""looked right"" not because of dazzlingly wonderful chops."
2,filter constantly needs to be changed!!!!! Expensive upkeep,I have replaced the filter on this multiple times this winter---mold growth is a problem!!!! Filters definitely do not last a season. Good humidifier if willing to deal with this problem and spend the money.
4,"Works great, cools/humidifies/cleans the air in one end of the house.","The only reason I didn't give it a ""5"" was that the canisters are a little hard to fill up since the tops aren't flat so that they stand up for filling.Other than that-- easy to carry the canisters for filling and the castors make it easy to move the unit around.The fan is quiet on the lower settings and that's all I've ever needed to use.It had a small chip in the plastic of one of the canisters but there was no leaking so I didn't return it."
2,I love it because it produced a lot of moisture but it broke after 2 weeks,"Shortly, i had no negative feelings about the work of this humidifier. The only problem was that while it was really quiet most of the time at certain periods it started to roar - pretty noisy. it woke me up one night. but it didn't happen often.Then, after 2 weeks, it stopped working. Probably that roaring was the sign of some existing deffect. I sent it back to amazon and ordered a new one, not Honeywell this time."
2,Disappointed,"I bought these programs for my four year old daughter and I am not impressed. From what I can see they only offer ""Same or Different"" and ""Does it Belong"". I was hoping for more like letters, numbers, pre-reading.She gets bored quickly with these games. Another problem is they don't allow you to save where you are so every time you start the program you have to start at the beginning.I also bought the Leap Frog Learning DVDs and they are excellent. My daughter knows all the alphabet sounds and is already starting to put words together."
5,calphalon everyday pan with lid,"I have been using calphalon for 10 years, but this everyday pan is the best so far. I love the fact that is has two short handles instead of the usual long one that sticks out. It is definitely used everyday in our house!"
1,suggested retail price,"After checking the Calphalon web site the Suggested Retail price for model R1384 14"" Everyday Pan is $160.00.I am dissapointed that this is not a true discounted price."
2,misleading,"The book itself had no pencil marks or tears but the title of ""like new"" was inaccurate. It had lots of shelf wear and the pages were a yellowish color and were wrinkly and hard like they had been in a damp place. It was readable I was just disappointed overall."
2,"Hard to Endure, Even for the Diehard","Choose wisely if purchasing this anthology. It does have some great matches, as there was a move away from only elimination matches to singles matches.The Bret Hart matches in 1995 against Nash, and his 1996 match against Austin are bright spots, but I lost interest by the 1994 Series and could barely manage to get through it. Midget clowns...Yokozuna at gradually more massive sizes...they were brutal.Even for a diehard WWF fan, it was hard to focus on all of the mid-1990s Survivor Series. The storylines seem to be at their most cartoonish. Be sure that this is an anthology that you'll watch more than once. I found it challenging to get through this anthology, let alone watching the all the events again. I would equate the events to WrestleManias 8, 9, and 11. It represents a transitional period for the WWF, and I know that the challenges stemming from the steroid scandals among others strained the available talent pool."
3,"Scholarly, not for casual listening","I agree with the reviewer who said this set was for ""scholars"". If you want a CD that you can play for your friends, that sounds good all the way through, this isn't it. There are a lot of tracks on here that just sound like generic R&B.; Of course there are also brilliant recordings, but you'd want to make your own ""mix"" before you just sit back and listen without hitting the fast forward button.This set includes Elmore James's entire recorded output, except for the recordings he made for the Chess and Meteor/Flair labels. As such it's a good place for DJ's or afficionados to start building a complete collection.The liner notes include a good synopsis of all of Elmore's recording sessions, including those not represented in this set."
1,Not What I Expected,"I purchased this video for my 7 year old twins to introduce them to jazz dance. It is poor quality, from the 80's, and definitely not for beginners. I returned it."
3,It Works,"But the way it is organized leaves a bit to be desired. That said, if you're stuck for a chord, and you don't know how to build them from scratch, this will get you where you need to go."
1,"low quality, distorted image",I get lots of smear and ghosting with this cable. Returning it. This is the second cable I've bought off Amazon and both of them sucked (different brands). Guess I'll stick with the local brick-and-mortar stores. They're less likely to sell garbage if they have to look you in the eye.
5,Popular mood music,This is an excellent collection of all time favorite melodies played by the best artists.
5,"Well organized, extremely readable","Gordon lays the material out very nicely, proceeding in a top down style. He seems to provide the information your requiring just when you need it. Begins by providing good motivation for the topic, which is often missing in many technical books. Good breadth too, covered all my questions."
2,For most applications the JavaSoft site covers what you need,"As my title says ""For most applications the JavaSoft site covers what you need."" In working through this book I often found it easier just to surf over to:...And figure it out. Of course the Sun site doesn't cover NT Services, etc.. So the book isn't a total loss....Steve"
1,Not for Java programmers - catered to C/C++,"If you are a Java programmer trying to learn how to connect to C/C++ libraries this book is definitely not for you. You will have to buy another book to supplement this one just learn C/C++ so you can run the examples which by the way do not work. I was disgusted with this book as I had read a few positive reviews, but as I read them closer they were all authored by C/C++ programmers. Again this book is not a Java programmers book and should be cast aside by such."
1,NOT For Any Sort of Frying purposes,"I wanted something large to be able to fry fish, chicken, meats, etc. This is NOT the pan for it. With many of my previous teflon coated pans and even the hard anodized pans, I would use very little oil, maybe slightly coating the bottom. Here, even with about 1/2 cm of oil in the bottom, the fish stuck to the point where I couldn't even scrape it off using both wooden utensils, chopsticks, and metal spatulas. I guess a good thing is that metal can be used...I knew that this was bad for eggs as the saleslady mentioned that, but she claimed that all meats wouldn't stick which is a complete lie! For sauces, it probably would work fine, but why would you need non stick for sauces? In fact, when I make sauce, I like to use steel without any of the nonstick chemicals...Don't buy this crap unless you're not going to be frying anything on it."
1,"Terrible product, terrible customer service from Direct Care. Please do not buy this product.","We ordered 2 of these even though I read some negative reviews regarding them. I was hopeful because we had one of these years ago and it was fairly effective. However the two we ordered not only don't work, they leak water all over - I believe from where the impeller fits on the tanks - so a huge mess and except for the water that they leak and the wet towels from cleaning up the messes, it seemed to add very little humidity to the air - useless. If it was possible to give the product a negative star review, I would have done so. After communicating with the seller several times, they refuse to do anything - just replied, talked to their department that handles these things and since they had no complaints and no comments from the manufacturer regarding and recalls, they will do nothing. Hopefully Amazon will stand behind their A-Z guarantee and help us out or we have lost the cost of the humidifiers."
1,Never worked!,I am now in the process of packing this item and returning it. It leaks water all over and we could never get it to stop. Instructions were read over and over again to no avail.
3,Cradle of Filth,"As one of my friends so poetically said, this is basically the boy band of BM. They took a genre that prides itself in its blistering atmosphere, its coldness and its speed and made it less brutal, less cold and less fast. Now thats not always bad, but when you're done with a few COF songs its like, oooooookay, 'hey lets put 'Battles in the North' back in!'. Cause while this isn't at all bad black metal, its just not as good as the bands they took their music from. If you think this is too pop for you just get some of the oldest MayheM, get, Immortal, Darkthrone, 'in the nightside eclipse', Ulver's 'Nattens Madrigal' or something, you get the idea. But anyway, i guess Cradle of Filth is a worthy doorway into what people can really do with the beautiful shadows and fires of music."
5,another killer recording,this time around the band seems to borrow concepts from Nile for a unique atmosphere unlike their previous releases.these are the best tracks:2. The Promise Of Fever5. Damned In Any Language (A Plague On Words)6. Better To Reign In Hell8. Carrion10. Presents From The Poison Hearted12. Babalon A.D. (So Glad For The Madness)13. A Scarlet Witch Lit The Season14. Mannequin15. Thank God For The SufferingA worthy addition to Cruelty and V-empire.
4,Bitter suites to succubi part 2 !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Excellent!!!!,"Whoever liked cradle of filths Bitter suites to succubi will probably like this one. Lots of simmilarites in rythim, singing, and of course as always great lyrics. his voice isnt the same anymore wich is why i gave it 4 stars but i very much like the effects he uses on it, so it sounds very nice. ALOT better than MIDIAN cd wich i personally didnt like. This cd is great, i love it, brings back the feeling i had when i heard bitter suites to succubi- so if you liked that cd buy this, oh and chorus is great too..."
1,No,"Dani Filth told Metal Hammer this was going to be the best album yet. He said how much they are going to improve, probably because on Sony Records. And he said there was going to be a 40 piece orchestra thing... Yeah there is, but the albums CR-P! Oh he was so wrong. This is the most boring CD I own. Nothing makes you want to pick this CD up again. Babalon A.D is horrid. Get Midian or Cruelty first. Don't bother with this."
4,good but could have been great,"Considering this band said they used a full orchestra on this album, I expected much more. To me, you really dont notice it. It sounds about as orchestrated as any of there other albums(meaning I do not hear any greater depth of instruments, like you do with metallica or aeorsmith when they did the same thing). I share a similar complaint that some others mentioned. This band really needs to let their female singer sing more. That is one aspect that makes their midian album better than this. Anyway, all and all it was a very good album, songs that stand out in my mind at the moment are ""Better To Reign In Hell,Serpent Tounge, and Babalon A.D."" One thing is for sure, their next album will either make them or break them, because it sounds like they might be running out of ideas. I wish they would keep in the direction of the midian, or bitter albums!"
3,Damnation,I have been a COF fan since Dusk and Her embrace came out. This is a far cry from what they used to be. Production is excellent and everything on this new album. This is still somewhat Black Metal with great production but this is not what COF used to be.
5,Deadbolt's Daily Review,"Hurt and Virtue is one of the most ripping, slashing songs I have heard. Danny's voice goes form high to low in only the way a seriously heavy band could do. Damnation and a Day is a must for all heavy rockers who would dare call themselves that.Babylon A.D. is their famous one, but they're all just as good. Recommended to me by a friend, I brought this album and stuck it in my C.D. player. Ouch...Buy it if you dare...don't buy it if your nothing. A friend saw them live and said they were amazing. I heard this album and thought they were insane. The rest is up to you..."
2,Bof...,"Compared with Cruelty And The Beast (the greatest album EVER!), this ""epic"" soundtrack is poorly written and very disappointing for such a great band as Cradle Of Filth, and for such a talented and intelligent lyrist as Dani. During the first of the album, the British band remained true to their goal to tell the story of Lucifer, the Morning Star, cast away from Heaven for rebelling against G-d and Mankind, but as the songs goes on, the lyrics loose track of the story; ending up with songs like Mannequin, which has absolutely nothing to do with Lucifer. They could've done an album MUCH better (even better than Cruelty... if they really wanted to). One on a Biblical proportion; when you consider that the Devil, and other lesser demons appear more than once in the Bible and the Gospels. If you want epics Cruelty... IS much better!"
5,"Delightful, Entertaining and Educational","""Santa Shops on eBay"" is a delightful work by Marsha, both a friend and colleague. Visually interesting with actual eBay Stores and lots of great shopping tips and tricks. Marsha never fails to deliver the goods. I give it two big thumbs up and hope you will read it too!"
4,very nice,"great little speakers, love the sound, they look nice, the only complaint I have about them is minor, the blue lights flash and move all the time, and thats a bit annoying"
2,Lousy audio support,"This set would be much better if the author had hired a concert pianist to play on a superior piano. Just because you only intend to play one note at a time, doesn't mean any ol' meat handed lounge player can make the recording. On the contrary, on an ear training set you want to take care not to have distracting overtones caused by an inferior instrument and a careless touch. I can't recommend anything so sloppy for the purpose of training the ear.I'm afraid to say that none of these focused ear traing methods are very good. If you want to do it right, get Schiff's recordings of the Well Tempered Clavier along with the Dover scores. First analyze the score, then listen to the CD while following along with the score. Schiff has the good taste to play only the Bosendorfer piano (nothing else comes close) and he won't rattle your brains with buzzing, hammered overtones."
2,Your basic RHPS Primer,"If you want costume detail: get ""The Official Rocky Horror Picture Show Movie Novel"" (Foto Novel) or any RHPS DVD with still-frame capability. Henkin provides adequate 1980 dated RHPS cult narrative history with nominal illustrations and some inaccuracies. However, if you want a general overview from that era of this movie, this is your book. Worth the read. At the time this book was cutting edge. Read it, know it, love it. Standard library fare.A CAUTION: Amazon does not always distinguish hardcover from softcover on its product pages. Contact the seller since the actual offering may be a Tradeback softcover."
2,Useful but SEVERELY out-of-date.,"This book is good for someone looking for basic information about ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", but most if not all the information on the ""Rocky Horror Experience is severely out of date.The pictures are very good, but be careful if you want to use them as a reference for costuming. There are several transposed images, most notably the photo of Riff and Magenta in their ""spacesuits""."
1,CATS Fans Can Pass On This One,"Fans of CATS looking for new and interesting recordings of their favorite show won't miss having this album in their collection. People unfamilar with the show would also do well to pass on this recording in favor of the Broadway, London, German or Australian cast recordings instead.Unlike the cast recordings which have powerful music and strong vocals, the music on this album is very weak by comparison. Even large group songs were apparently only sung by a small group of four or five singers, which makes these songs lose the energy and power that the show really has.The only positive point that I have about this album is the instramental version of Memory that is on it. It at least makes the CD good for kareoke."
1,Not instramental,I don't know what the other person was talking about. I was hoping to get an instramental version of Cat's Soundtrack. I was very dissapointed when I got this one and it included the lyrics. This is the third time I have ordered what appeared to be an instramental CD on Amazon and was dissapointed when the CD arrived. I am giving up ordering through them.
2,Am I missing something here?,"I agree with the other reviewers comments on this book. How accurate are passed down stories from ancestors many generations back. While reading the book I had no idea which ""facts"" were from historical accounts or which came from passed down stories. Also, ""the white man"" as portrayed by the author is evil, selfish, greedy, and full of lies while the Indians were brave, valiant, honest, and trustworthy. yeahhhh right. I have read enough factual historical accounts that show Indians as being every bit as corrupt as the white man. The only difference is the whites were greater in number and were intellectually superior when it came to developing weapons. The author is clearly biased. I don't recall him ever putting down the Indians for their savage scalping or pointless raids on other tribes, but as soon as the whites leave behind some trash on the trail it is noted. Not impressed at all."
1,done with amazon,"This beautiful level set arrived from Amazon in a plastic bag - not a cardboard box, not a mailing tube, not even bubble wrap but taped together in a plastic bag. Of course there was damage but it was small so I decided to keep it which is probably what Amazon was counting on. I'm tired of fighting with Amazon and talking with people from India who have no idea what is normal or correct in the USA. From now on I'll pay for shipping and deal with a smaller company that cares about it's customers and reputation and that I can talk and reason with. Oh - the levels are great."
2,Old text and Photos,"I purchased this book for instruction on new pond construction. The text was somewhat informative, but the pictures were a joke. They show pond construction using steam shovels! I sent my copy back."
3,I enjoy cooking the recipes in this book,"A friend gave me this book, and I thank her! I am enjoying using it in my Rival 1.5 quart slow cooker! Especially enjoy the Manhattan clam chowder and beef stew. The recipes often call for canned, sliced veggies. This is a time saver. I also like the fact that the recipe is ready in about 3 hours' time instead of the traditional 8-10 hours in the large slow cooker. There are times I need to cut back on the liquid the recipe calls for. Can always add more liquid at the end of cooking, before serving. It is nice to use a slow cooker which makes a smaller amount, just right for two!"
2,Woefully narrow sense of the place.,"AMit Gilboa's OFF THE RAILS starts out giving a vivid sense of a fascinating city, but soon the pounding one note he strikes, the note of westerns as bottom feeders out for rotten good times, begins to weary. Any visitor in Phnom Penh meets and sees some of the people Gilboa knows--they are there and Gilboa provides something of a record of their existence. But Phnom Penh offers so much more than his talk of the depressing ""Majestic"" Hotel crowd. Yeah, in a one-line disclaimer in the preface he admits that such people aren't the whole picture, but good journalism must not ignore the greater context after a such a limp disclaimer. Sure, show us the Majestic crowd but at least show them rubbing shoulders with the other expats in the city who work in real education, in building commerce, in landmine operations, in goverment exchanges, in journalism, in physical therapy. Gilboa presents a sensationalist vison--no big problem about that; but it is incredibly narrow."
4,Great for the Learning Delayed or Autisic Child,"My daughter is 4 years old and has high-functioning autism. She loves this video and asks for it everyday. She is naming all the animals in the ""A to Z"" section. The pictures are beautiful with soothing music in the background. I plan on buying another Baby Good Sports DVD."
1,Waste of money,I purchased this product as it claims to be made for the iRiver Clix 2. IT IS NOT purposed made. The case is too large and bulky and is a generic case into which the iRiver clix 2 will fit (so also will your cell phone - it is so large. Do not go for this product - i have never used it and probably never will!Horizontal Leather Case with Belt Clip/Loop for the iRiver Clix 2 (Clix2 / U20)
2,Cute short story written as a novella,"You must admit that the first few pages of the book, as the reader learns of William's story, are cute, endearing and funny. However, after 20 pages of this, it was already too much. The 100 pages that follow continue to be too much! The idea of exploring an underachiever's mindset is interesting and possibly what attracted most readers to the book, as I think many people at least wonder if they have fulfilled their ""potential."" However, all William does is revel in it--he does little to illuminate the reasons for it in him or in others. The book seems to simply rehash William's unchanging mindset, which, granted, is the idea--he is a devoted underachiever, and perhaps underachieves by telling a story of an awkward length. But the book really needed to be much shorter or much longer. William is too one-dimensional to interest us for the length of this short novel."
2,Tough to finish,"The life of William, an underachiever, is revealed from childhood to adulthood. His twin, Clive, is his opposite--successful and well liked. William receives just below average grades, attends a below average school, has below average girlfriends, and tells a below average story."
5,A very entertaining and funny novel.,"An Underachiever's Diary was a very good novel. Not since Catcher in the Rye have I had so much fun reading a novel. I never wanted to stop reading it. The book is about a young man named William, who is a complete loser throughout his whole life and trys his best to not be in the shadow of his own younger twin brother Clive, who is a very successful person. The sad thing is that William has had bad luck ever since his birth in the hospital room. It is funny, however, how he never tries to become like his brother even though he idolizes him and just when things start to go right for him, he gets messed up again. He is like a modernized Holden Caulfield. Overall, this is a very good book to read and I highly recommend it."
3,An interesting testimony of a period in the south,"A book is an interesting testimony of the poor people in the South in the 1930s. Some criticized it for making money from the fates of the poor, or for fabricating what people were saying on the photographs. Well, Calldwell said himself that people on the photos didn't say what he wrote and he warns the reader about that in the beginning. In my opinion some of the passages are really a bit too opinionated or maybe Caldwell tries to preach the reader. However, together with good photographs we get to know much about the plight of the poor tenant farmers and sharecroppers in the south, and also about the consequences of poverty and hunger. I recommend reading also some of Caldwell's novels or short stories: Tobacco Road, The God's Little Acre, Trouble In July."
1,An alternative product,"I have the Escort 8500 model which includes this suction mount. The mount constantly falls off my windshield. I was going to order a new one to see if it improved things, but the reviews her made me think twice. Then I found an aftermarket mount at southerncarparts dot com. It's a bit more expensive but looks solid and worth the extra cost. It looks like the mounts that come with GPS systems."
1,What you see if what you get - 1 bracket and 2 cups,"This is the same cheap, low suction, bouncy (due to the metal bracket flexing) mount that came new with your Escort detector. The new cups will work marginally better than your old, worn out cups but you will soon come back to your car and find your detector on the floor or dangling from the power cable. Some folks recommend putting your old cups in boiling water for a bit to freshen them up for better grip, but I have not tried it.The Valentine V1 mount is head and shoulders better than this offering from Escort (as is the V1 detector) but the 8500 X50 works pretty good and can be found a lot cheaper - but the Escort mount is just terrible.Note that if you buy a replacement suction cup mount direct from Escort or at many other online stores you get the bracket and FOUR new suction cups - so you have spares when the first two quit gripping. This item from Amazon is just the bracket and TWO cups."
