1,A sure cure for insomniacs,"I had no idea such a visually intense movie could be so bloody boring. It attempts to recreate the night in which Mary Shelly got the idea for her novel ""Frankenstein."" The entire movie plays like a dream or hallucination sequence, with unintentionally funny dialogue and marginal acting by a cast that would be impressive in any other movie. If you enjoy gratuitously lush visuals supported by a weak script and embarassed actors, go ahead and rent this movie somewhere. If you have more important things to do, like taking a nap, or watching grass grow, you might want to pass."
5,"Excellent guide to the ""must do"" adventures in Maui!","I found Mr. McMahon's suggestions excellent. Especially when using the guide for our ""Road to Hana"" trip. There are Audio cassettes available all over the Island to guide your course along the way, but we found this book much more enlighntening. We had several tour books and local guide books and ended up only using ""Adventuring"" for our entire stay!!"
3,cute shirt,The shirt got rave reviews - but the shipping and handling was atrocious. It was just as much as the shirt. Wish I could have found it in the store.
2,Let Me Explain,I bought this a while back. It arrived in great condition and looked great. I had a lot of trouble setting this up on my computer. It was hard to get tech help and it currently sits in my closet. I went and bought a Lynsys a few days later. Maybe I am just not intelligent enough to hook this up but it didn't work for me.
4,Wired Router,"Have used 2 D-Link routers in the past for my home network, and they performed like they were supposed to. However, both failed after a couple of years and am hoping this one lasts longer.Had to call tech support as the installation was any thing but ""plug and play"". There were several settings that had to be changed to accomodate my network which is DSL from ATT. We are using Windows 7 as the operating system, one 32 bit, and one 64 bit.After installation was completed, the router has worked like it is supposed to.At this time we only have 1 desktop and 1 laptop connected with another cable plugged in for a visitor with a computer."
3,Some problems,"I gave it a try, but it did not work for me. May be it is not for AT&T because this router connects to internet directly. It does not let modem to connect. Actually, Router needs your AT&t ID and Password then it connects to interent through modem, but router is taking control of the connection instead of letting modem to do it. I have no problem with it even if it is taking control, but the real problem is that it drops connection after some time. I have tried different settings, but it never stays connected to interent more than 24 hours. There is some kind of problem which I am still unable to figure out. I have it for more than a year already, but I am not using it anymore. I gave it a try for a week. May be it can work for someone, but it did not for me. I am good in computers."
1,Have To Reboot Once A Week or Slows To A Crawl,"There is probably a reason that the ""latest"" firmware released for this router is four years old. This router is horrible. Unfirtunately I discovered six weeks after the Amazon return period that my network issues were from this router. You get what you pay for and this thing is horrible.While plugged into modem directly I get 10 megs down. Put this router in-line and it drops to 2.5 megs down...wow...that's not what is supposed to happen is it?Save your money..."
2,Has some quirks,Well it was easy to setup and use. However i noticed it would lose sync with the ISP overtime the DHCP time would renew. I tried everything to fix the problem but it persisted and no settings would suffice.
1,Piece of Junk!,"This router is terrible. First, very unclear directions for Mac setup. Once hooked up, it FREQUENTLY drops the connection, especially when web browsing with multiple tabs or high bandwidth activities. Tried both DHCP and static IP addresses; no difference in performance Called D-Link customer support. No help at all. After an hour on the phone and no solution D-Link insisted that the driver on the mac computers must need to be updated. The drivers are the latest version but that was the end of the road for D-Link's support- blame it Apple. Product was cheap, but you really get what you pay for. Won't be buying another D-Link product anytime soon."
2,"Worked for a few months, then overheated and quit","Router worked fine for about 5 months and then overheated and quit. We ordered a Cisco Linksys replacement and installed it. According to the D-Link warranty info, I needed to have a Case ID number from an online tech who would first walk me through troubleshooting procedures. We needed an immediate router solution. I never did get around to uninstalling the new router so I could reinstall the non-functioning D-Link and call the D-Link tech support to get the required Case ID number. I'm not a computer novice so I'm sure the problem was with the D-Link router malfunctioning, particularly since nothing in the environment had changed and the new Linksys router resolved the problem. Plus, I would have had to pay for shipping the D-Link back to the manufacturer. Just wasn't worth the time, cost and hassle. The D-Link EBR 2310 was a disappointment. We chose it to replace an older technology D-Link that had served us well for several years."
3,wired router works ... but ...,"wired router works ... but ... with cable modem and power switch at the door it needs to be coaxed back into sharing the modem - looks ok for real time always live but would not recommend for a novice unless they have lots of time to access it with a browser and tweak it until it's happy - but for $25 it solves a problem so maybe it's ok for us, the last of the wired dinosaurs"
1,BETTER LOOK ELSEWHERE,"I 've had this router for about nine months I tgave me trouble from day one. All i needed it for was to run my little Roku, for movies. kept dis-conecctilng from the internet. tech support is very poor. Spend your money elswhere"
3,Only Average For Kerastase,"I`m a HUGE fan of Kerastase products. I basically swear by them. But this is not one of their better products. I tried it for something different, but find it to be no more inspiring than mid-range leave-in conditioners. I usually give Kerastase products raving 10`s. I would give this one a 6.8 at best. I did NOT notice the ""ultra shine"" the product title implies. Also, when the shipment arrived, the bottle had leaked and had lost about 15% of the content.Kerastase has other leave-in conditioners that are far better than this one.If anyone from the Kerastase company happens to read this review... PLEASE start using botanical scents for your products. Kerastase products are generally some of the best hair care products a person could ever hope for, but they smell like a typical, chemical laden day at the hair salon.How about some lavendar, citrus, tropical flowers? Use real botanical essences and no one will be able to resist your products ever again."
3,A good traditional approach to learning Portuguese,"This review also relates to the first edition. This text covers all the basics of Spoken Brazillian Portuguese with a style and reading level appropriate for university students. This book isn't perfect, but then the other choices available aren't either. I've studied four other foreign languages and now live in Brasil and overall I would recommend the book. The book does employ colloquial language but this is how the real people of Brasil speak. Some of the cultural essays are a bit biased but they are not intended as professional sociological studies. They represent the current thinking of Brazilian young adults. This book is best suited for classroom study or for use with a language tutor. The writing and lab manual and tapes which supplement the text are also helpful."
5,A Wonderful Read - you won't put it down or soon forget,"This is the first book that I have ever taken the time to review; that speakes volumns right there. Listen, this book is just a great read. A thoughtfully written piece that is a fun romp, an intriguing page-turner, is thought-provoking and soul tugging all in one. It's not an intellectual read, but then that's the real beauty of it. You won't find yourself searching for a dictionary to figure out what anything means, but you will find yourself going back and re-reading parts just because they were so much fun or so intriguing the first time. Ok - enough's enough. Really, buy it. I'm telling you that you won't regret it."
1,"Didn't work, so disappointed","I received this bank today, opened it up, added batteries, followed the instructions for inserting money and...nothing. My husband and I proceeded to mess around with it for several minutes to no avail. Good thing I tried it out before I gave it to my son for Christmas!"
1,Fun but flimsy--Made in China,"This toy worked for all of 5 minutes. Then it seemed to jam and not work anymore. I tried a number of things to fix it, which was challenging because it is not well made. Nothing worked.This product is made in China. Why don't product descriptions from Amazon indicate where products are made?"
1,Worked for one day,We have ordered two of these and each one only worked for about a day. We really want one that works - our grandsons loved it when it was operating correctly. Is there any possiblity of getting one that does work?
4,Fascinating!,"I really enjoyed this book - particularly the chapters recounting the wolf's history through myth and literature. The hardest-to-read chapters were the ones recounting the many tortures mankind has inflicted upon the wolf. Some of these sections were stomach-turning and emotionally heart-wrenching. What surprised me the most about this book was that there was not more on convergent evolution and the early history of men and wolves. Still, it was a fascinating book and a terrific read."
5,My Brain Laughed Outloud,"Blazek's mind bending comics gets to my funny bone like none other. This book is as good if not better then the first ""Loose Upon the World"" in that the each page brings on more mind bending humor then the last. Have had family and friends pick it up off the end table and they have not been able to put it down; thinking at times with a quirky smile - laughing out loud at other strips! Keep them coming...."
5,A good introduction to an amazing photographic eye,"I read about the Phaidon 55S series in Popular Photography and thought I would check out the volume on Mary Ellen Mark. I have been drawn to her photographs for years and had recently seen an exhibition of her work in NYC. She has Walker Evan's gift for capturing moments in people's lives and she finds the life beyond the smile or grimace of the subject.Her subjects are lively and a bit wicked at times, but there is supreme truth in her photographs. This series gets its title from the fact that each book has 55 photos by the subject. The price is excellent for someone who wants to collect some great art for a low price. Great introduction to a talented artist....highly recommended."
5,Boyle's Crowning Achievement,"This is by far Boyle's best work yet. He was initially deeply vilified for writing this novel, but as California's political and social climate shifted, and became part of mainstream cognizance the same people who labeled him as 'human garbage' now praise him and this novel for what it suggests about the nature of California's immigration and the vast social connections it makes within the state's culture. By far my favorite novel ever!"
3,"Raises some interesting issues, but is totally unrealistic","Immigration, both of people and of animals, is an important topic. So is the unequal distribution of wealth. On the other hand, I felt that the book was somewhat irresponsible and shallow. The story is completely unrealistic. I hope no one is gullible enough to think that this book is a realistic portrait of life in Los Angeles. Similarly, the characters are just plain silly. The book is still readable, but understand that you will be reading a political cartoon, not serious social commentary or literature."
1,A waste of life,Our book club selected this book and I couldn't be sorrier to discover that it existed. It pretends to be clever and sympathetic but delivered with the most disingenuous note. The best use for my copy would be to tear each page and use it to wipe windows or clean toilets. Total rubbish.
2,Stereotype upon stereotype,"We are reading this book for our book group. I'm not sure if it made me uncomfortable because the perspective was so accurate or if it was because it never went beyond the stereotypes that I already have.I didn't like one character in the book. Even the dogs and the kid were annoying. While that may have been the result of good writing, the end product was that I was left feeling nothing but ""ick."" The characters seemed one dimensional even though a large amount of time was spent detailing their thoughts and opinions. I never understood the ""why's"" behind any of their actions, just their histories. Perhaps I was too slow to draw the conclusion.I felt like a big, over consumerized, ungrateful loser.If that's your thing, you may love the book."
1,"Oh my, how awful....","What an awful cast of shallow, unsympathetic and stereotyped characters (and caricatures). It's lucky that they're such awful people, however, because if you cared about them, you'd be overcome by the torrent of serial misfortune that befalls them (spoiler alert): Let see: Three brutal rapes, including the brutal rape/murder of a teenage girl, man hit by car, two beloved dogs eaten by coyotes, multiple cats eaten by humans, forest fire, floods, brutal mugging, child molestation, baby born blind (due to STD transmitted in previous brutal rape...), baby dies...I'm sure I've missed something...and this is all in the course of a few months....All culminating in an ending that leaves you shaking your head....Perhaps the author ran out of calamities."
4,"Oh, My!","This is a very intriguing story - honestly more a piece of literature than a simple novel. It has resounding characters that you pity, but don't identify with (or at least I didn't). The opening car accident reeled me in and that's what the whole rest of the book felt like: a car accident. I couldn't tear my eyes away from the pages.Overall, I liked it, but it's definitely the type of book that would be nice to talk to someone about. It would be nice for book discussion groups, and definitely evoke a lively discussion with the wide variety of issues that Boyle touched upon here. Although, I don't really know that I would loosely recommend it to everyone, as it is certainly not light reading. But I did think it has much stronger writing than Boyle'sThe Inner Circle."
1,Horrible,"This book is horrible. It's barely even readable. Nearly every paragraph is packed with tiresome analogies that go on forever and could only make sense to the person writing them.Then there's the story. Lost in all his cumbersome, descript, superfluous writing is this little story that goes absolutely nowhere. And the ending--I forced myself through 350 pages for that? Give me a break.Unadulterated crap."
2,Ahhh,Predictable storyline and nothing new. I read it for a college English class and I just it was boring. Props for the author for writing the book and cool title but I don't care for this book at all.
1,WOW!,"I consider myself a fairly well-read individual and as a 1st generation Mexican American, I thought this would be an interesting book to read read. Early on, it became abundantly clear what this book was about.It was garbage. The moral of the story is that if you want a better life, your S- outta luck. Settle for what you have and don't ask for more!""Materialism is bad"". Isn't materialism and the right to complain what this country was built on?"
1,One of the Worst Books I've Ever Read,"Not only was the writing style reminiscent of high school creative writing class (fill it up with adjectives and adverbs, who needs character motivation or development?) but the story was exaggerated, overblown and entirely unrealistic; for this kind of story, I had more fun wathcing ""Volcano."" I thought it was not a responsible narrative of the immigration situation here in Los Angeles. There was no tranformation or evolution of character except from bad to worse,and if I was supposed to like or identify with anybody, or gain insight, it totally failed."
2,Leaves no cliche unturned.,"Dumb Mexican squatters and dumb bourgeois white Californians. Nobody understanding their impact on the landscape, etc. etc. etc. A hackneyed story, although line by line readable enough. Just not rewarding."
5,Faulkner/Cormac McCarthy/Steinbeck/Leonard Cohen/Springstein,"Boyle is all of these men, and writes in celebration of the cult of ""Beautiful Loosers.""Something is happening in Norte America... Read these authors,read about Chris MacCandless-- the loss of innocence, the loss of lifeas celebration of life-- the valorization of frailty against the world.Boyle writes like an narcisist who thinks he understands painand the roots of confusion and the cult of loss. He is truly a talecrafter to be read critically.My head applauds his synthetic thinking, my heart prays he sleeps for a month in aditch in Juarez. What one finds there is notbeautiful. Life has not been lost--only the rich can think this. It is somethingelse--something yet to be captured by contemporary writers.Perhaps it lies outside the bounds of words, the bounds of books."
4,A Tragedy For Our Times,The Tortlla Curtain deals with the controversial topic of illegal immigration. After reading 100 pages I had to stop for a month becauseI was afraid to read more of this sad story. I cared for the people in this tale. Neither of the two families were bad people. Once you knew them it was difficult to judge them. This is a great book for a book discussion.
1,Truth and Deceit,"As a sincere Christian, I find this book to offensive. It is neither a true Bible, nor Orthodox, nor Jewish. It is one of many attempts by so-called ""Messianic Jews"" to deceive Jews who have little or no training in their own faith, by pretending that Christian faith is really Jewish. The Gospel of Christ has no need of this kind of trickery. As Paul says in Romans 11, though Jews do not believe in Jesus, they are beloved by God, ""for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable."" God's covenant with the Jewish people therefore is still in full effect, and their way to God is valid. Christians follow a different way to God, also valid. If you come from a Jewish background, educate yourself about the truth of Judaism, a beautiful and ancient tradition, full of spiritual and moral depth. Then, if you decide to be a Christian, you will be making a choice based on truth, not on deceit."
1,Bad deal,"This looks more like an ice-cream scoop. As a 4-quart pan, it would appear to be chock full of fail---it does not have the advertised capacity, and its plastic would melt or burn over even a low flame."
4,Great pool float,"Durable, doesn't fade. Holds up to the antics of kids who think it is a diving board, trampoline, etc. Easy to inflate. Fun to use."
3,Technicolor is the real star,"I watched this on Turner Classic Movies a few nights ago. I found it an average horror movie with some surprisingly grisly elements in the plot, probably due to the fact that the Production Code didn't have any teeth until the mid-30s. The use of two-color Technicolor was probably what ""made"" the film. Although most of the film was in the shadows, the Technicolor bathed it in shades of orange and green, giving an unnaturally eerie look, especially in the lab scenes. I thought actor Lee Tracy's physical comedy stuck out like a sore thumb, as did Fay Wray's shrieks. All the scientist suspects looked appropriate spooky, and when the killer was revealed, the acting was ghoulishly hammy. God bless."
5,Scary Fairy Tale Penned by Painter,"This is a rare example of an artist who can write as well as they paint. The Plucker is a 160 page large-format hardcover, lavishly illustrated with over 100 Brom paintings, published by Abrams (the big art book publisher). The book is a delightfully politically-incorrect and convoluted ""children's book"" of the sort that children really do need to evoke the kind of nightmares that fire their imaginations (instead of the sweet simplistic pap they are usually fed). Where would Gary Larson be today if it weren't for reading ""Mr Bear Squash-You-All-Flat"" as a child?! The jacket blurb for The Plucker says: ""a world where fairy-tale tradition collides with vileness and depravity, love and heroism, suffering and sacrifice. A shadowy land of make-believe where happily ever after can cost you your very soul."" (Sleep tight, kiddies!)"
5,amazing Brom!!!,This book is really amazing : Brom mixes inside different kind of wonderful pictures. Furthermore the book is really well made : it impressed me. The paper is very good.enjoy your book
4,GM History,A nice overview of the corporation. I especially enjoyed some of thephotos of Flint area scenes.
3,okay,"this book was really good, until the ending. It seemed that westerfeld really wanted to finish his book, so he shoved a whole bunch of stuff into 10 measly pages and boom- the end. but, if you're hooked on the other 2 midnighters, this is a must."
1,Turn back now while there is still time!,"Ok I read all 3 books in this series because I read scott westerfeld's other series the uglies (which I loved), but I was extremely disappointed. I actually felt embarrassed for the writer after reading these books. The story is stupid and at the end nothing gets explained. I had my Mom and a friend read them just to make sure it wasn't just me and they hated them too. However I highly recommend reading The uglies series by the same author!"
1,doesn't help with static,"I bought this because my hair was very static-y due to winter weather. Used it once with the matching Kerastase conditioner, and my hair was much MORE static-y. Ended up throwing away both products."
1,Kerastase Shampoo,This product may have been ok exept for the smell it has a very unpleasant smell. It may have been old if it wasn't old and it still has this odor new I would not recomend this product.
5,Fabulous doll for toddlers and beyond!,"This was my daugher's third Corolle Doll... given to her at 2 years. She still loves ""Sarah"" and takes her everywhere. Now that my daughter is four, we will be giving her the newest Corolle known as Lia, who talks in four languages, but Sarah is still beautiful, has that wonderful scent, and is the prettiest baby doll I have seen so far. You cannot beat Corolle dolls for quality or life like features. In addition, they are meant to be played with and loved!"
3,ok but not what we wanted for the price,"my daughter was turning 6 and wanted a ""real"" life-like baby doll. we love our other corelles because they withstand a lot of abuse and smell lovely even after 4-5 years. this doll was disappointing because i thought it would have more weight to her body and feel more like a real baby, especially for $50. i think with dolls that are life-like, you need to pick them up and hold them. good luck."
1,Terribly inferior subtitling on this release!,"I acquired the MegaStar/Golden Collection release of Days of Being Wild at a relatively low price. While the video transfer is quite good, the English subtitles are so much of a mess that I had to stop and review several scenes before I could get a sense of the dialog. I've got a high tolerance for the occasional errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation found in subtitles on many otherwise excellent Asian releases of Asian films;but the subtitles here are so difficult to slog through that the viewer really comes away with a diminished sense of what the film is about.After watching this version, I rented the Kino release. The subtitles are excellent -- as is the film, of course -- so my advice would be to avoid this one and get the Kino. Also, if ordering used, be sure that the seller is in fact offering the Kino version -- I've seen this one for sale on the Kino page as well, so look closely."
1,Very small,Looks like a print out from regular color printer. Very small. Not like a movie poster. Don't know what else to say here
4,all about braising,"I am a very average cook, and at first I had hoped for more scope and less detail. Having said that, I have recently prepared 3 recipes for guests, and all of them played to rave reviews. It isn't me, I just followed the very specific directions.In following the steps, I have discovered some tips about braising which have allowed me to ""free lance"". I have cooked some ""food section"" recipes, and the author's tips have helped me to bridge over the gaps.As a beginner, I am quite pleased with the text.... who knew cabbage could taste so good!"
3,Too many ingredients,"The final products of the recipes in this book are very good. That being said, I'm more about recipes that have fewer ingredients and don't take a long time to prep. The recipes in this book all have at least ten ingredients, not all staple items, and require too many steps. Just the leek dish took over an hour to make for my boyfriend and after a lot of work in the kitchen all I had to show for it was a braised leak side dish! Granted they were delicious but as a working woman I just don't have two hours at night to cook the dishes from this book. Perfect book for aspiring chefs or stay at home wife/husbands that have the time and energy to make complicated, delicious dishes."
3,The Take Is Okay,"At points, the background music is too loud. Music is used to set a mood, but, if I can't hear what the actors are saying, then the mood is lost. The part right around the TV scene comes to mind as an example of this.I think that the show got better as it went along. Tom Hardy is good at playing the roughest characters and giving them a part you can sympathize with. However, I didn't really feel that way with this character. You can't help but hate him throughout. I think that both female leads did great (Charlotte Riley and Kierston Wareing)."
4,Step-by-Step Ikebana,"I am a newcomer to flower arranging but I want my arrangements to look professional. This book is perfect for people like me -- the author tells you exactly what you need, what tools, what equipment, what plant and accessory materials, and then shows you step-by-step where to place each piece of the arrangement. I have varied my plant materials and accessories according to what I could find in my area, and the arrangements have been stunning. A book that explains the philosophy behind Ikebana would complement this book."
4,"There are better books, but I'D buy it.","This book is reflected from two different view points- that of Ria, and that of her brother. Ria, a half elf, is raised amongst humans, and her brother raised amognst elves. Ria, promised to marry a boy who's like a brother to her, longs for the understanding of someone, while her brother wishes that all the elves that stand against him would not. Will Ria and her brother learn to live with the race that cares for each, or will the plans of agroup of people run awry, and the two races go sofar as to kill each other as they did before Ria?"
4,Nice Towels,"I have several of these kitchen towels and really like them. I have not had the problems others mentioned with washing at all. I wash w/ my whites, no bleach, (oxiclean) and they remain in shape. I would recommend and am purchasing some more!"
3,My husband likes it,"I received the tomato red plaid (which matches nothing in my kitchen) as a free gift with a 10 qt Calphalon Dutch Oven (LOVE IT!), along with a free wooden spoon and a red pot holder. My husband likes the towel because it's big enough to dry his hands on in the kitchen. However, I would never spend the money for kitchen towels when I already have too many. Mine has laundered well and hasn't fallen apart as some have reported. It's my husband's kitchen towel and as long as he likes it I like it."
1,Defective order a week before company,"I started putting this tree together and it promised to be really beautiful. As I proceeded to add the middle section to the pole -- I couldn't!!!! The pole sizes do not fit inside one another, there are no brackets, and the instructions do not match this tree. Discouragingly, it looks as if this very tree may have been a return as the poles are already scuffed up a bit. Perhaps I received someone else's return. This is incredibly frustrating a week before company is arriving, and do you know how hard it is to return a Christmas tree! Furthermore, the instruction sheet gives no help line to call. I realize that all online orders carry some amount of risk that something like this will happen, but I've been ordering from [...] since they first started business in something like 1997, and it has just been within the last couple of years that I've received defective items. I'm very disappointed in this product."
3,Great movie but the ending was a letdown,"I was expecting some more interesting plot twist at the end. I felt like there were a number of things left unresolved. If you are looking just to scare some teens then really good movie, but for the rest of us - this is kind of a ""B"" movie."
2,Twisted,"What to say about this film...it's strange, disturbing, and...well that's it. Jack, the mutilated best friend, shows up throughout the film in various stages of decomposition to convince his friend to kill himself. David is a werewolf who must die to set his victims souls free. So, the plot is twisted but what horror film's plot isn't. The plus with this film, the part I liked, is the transformation David goes through to become the wolf. In an age where everything is cgied, it almost seems like costumes and makeup have become a lost art. Some cgi effects, like those in Cursed, are just terrible. Here, you don't have that. So, pick up the film and watch it. It's a fun, dark, twisted watch."
4,trivium liberal book review,You really need to read this book! It's an excellent incite into communication. If expressing yourself clearly and understanding others is what you are looking then this is the book!
4,Interesting lessons from a time capsule,"I have been looking through this fascinating book for several days, and I am convinced that it gives me a good view into the classic education of Catholic children. Sister Miriam Joseph was truly dedicated to the value of such an education, and who can fault her?The book is very old-fashioned, and it may contain too much warmed-over Aristotle, but it does get some things absolutely right: logic and grammar are essential to good speaking and good writing, and rhetoric is an essential study for those who would try for excellence. Just today I was reading more complaints from English teachers about the faults of the current curriculum; every time they assign some writing, it comes in with horrifying mistakes in both grammar and logic.For a deeper (and more interesting) discussion of rhetoric, I would recommendFarnsworth's Classical English Rhetoric."
4,"Not the best, but still fun to watch.","In 'Survivors' we see the Earth President visiting the station. As the episode unfolds, we witness an attempt on the president's life, while his security chief holds Garibaldi responsible for it. We also learn information on Garibaldi's past, who escapes to Down Below while Sinclair tries to get him off the hook.In 'By Any Means Necessary' a serious accident is causing a major strike and Sinclair has to work it out without betraying anyone: Earth dome, his crew or himself. Somewhat boring, but the side story is quite fun, as G'Kar and Mollari harass each other by stealing religious items."
4,Incredible,"The book's main character, Orchid, achieves one of the highest statures that a peasant in the Chinese Empire can attain. That is, she becomes a concumbine to the esteemed emperor. Making his way into his bedroom and into the politics that eventually deteriorate his mind and body, Orchid serves as the first empress to take part in the man-only world of the chinese government. Anchee Min paints an amazing picture of the male-dominant, eroticly-charged world of an empire based on archaic traditions. Empress Orchid is surprisingly fascinating and very hard to put down."
2,Surprisingly disappointing,"This is a sequential follow-up to The Last Emperor, and given the excellence of its predecessor, a really poor sequel. This book is so different, and so poorly crafted, it seems dubious that it is written by the same author. My expectations were admittedly sky-high, but honestly, this effort cannot even be considered OK. It is an extremely tedious, ""hard to get through"" read."
3,"Good, not great","A good read for any historical fiction fan. While based on the true story of Empress Orchid, the story had the typical plot of a lower class young woman defying all odds and expectations of women of her time and gaining unprecedented wealth, fame and power. Of course, the themes of deception, treason and alittle romance were thrown in for good measure. I kept having to remind myself that there was some truth to all of this soap opera.We read this for my book club and most of us were disappointed by its average and typical plot, but agreed that the writing was well done. Shold be enjoyed by most historical fiction fans-an interesting time period-I learned new things."
2,Boring and amateurish,"I am surprised to see so many positive reviews of this book. This is a silly book with ridiculous use of simile: . . .""My mind was a stewing pot where my thoughts turned into mushy beans."" (p126) There is no plot to speak of, it just drones on predictably."
2,Yawn,"I am a prolific reader but I occasionally found myself dozing off as long, boring passages were fairly common. I listen to all my books on tape and this usually enhances a book but I'm sorry to say I put this one down before I reached the half-way mark."
1,HORRIBLY DISSAPOINTED!!!!,"I WOULD NEVER RECCOMEND THIS TO ANYONE.. I OREDERED ON DEC 16 AND IT ARRIVED ON DEC 29TH. IT DOESNT EVEN LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THE BEAUTIFUL BASKET THAT IS DISPLAYED AND THERE ARE MANY THINGS MISSING/. NOT ONLY WAS I SO EMBARASED THAT I COULD NOT GIVE MY NEIGHBOR HER PRESENT FOR CHRISTMAS , NOW I HAVE THIS PUNY THING TO GIVE , WHICH IS NOT WORTH $40... IM GONNA TRY TO GET MY $$$ BACK... THIS IS THE LAST TIME I EVER ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN.!!!!"
5,Perfect!,"I ordered this online for a coworker who loves chocolate. The basket arrived very fast, was packed great, and the presentation and variety in the basket was the best! If you are looking for a great chocolate gift basket...I recommend this one."
3,Looks are deceiving,"Arrived on time and in good condition. A gift for the grandkids and family - kids loved the contents, but when I came to their house, the basket & contents looked a lot smaller than the online photo. Amazing what a wide angle lense can do!"
3,Sometimes You Buy A DVD And Find You've Been Had,"The video quality is pretty poor, like a third generation VHS copy. It has bad vertical hold and the video freezes every now and then. You can hear background noises like airplanes flying overhead, sirens, and traffic noises. There was no DVD insert and no DVD special features. The first poem read is about Sheri Martinelli."
5,Superman Free Throw Shooter's Fundamental Instructions,"Jacksonville, Florida's Ted St. Martin can shoot free throws with an accuracy beyond one's imagination to conceive. He owns the Guinness world's record for sinking 5,221 consecutive free throws.This is an excellent instructional basketball free throw shooting video that describes the proper mental philosophy, fundamentals and mechanics of free throw shooting.I perfom basketball shooting exhibition shows myself and I can attest to you that Ted's free throw shooting tips have assisted my own shooting."
2,How to Make the Lawyers Rich,"We are getting a ""pleasant"" divorce. Very few fights, just have different gooals in life. This book almost got me stirred up. It pushes many hot buttons and wants you to prepare for battle. I promptly destroyed the book for fear that my spouse would find it and get even more stirred up than me.It appears to be accurate, but I can't recommend it."
2,Pretty pictures and mostly useless,"Extremely disappointed with this. Save yourself the time and just go hang out at .... You'll get a lot more insight into making great motion graphics.Basically, there's a small section on each design studio, with one page devoted to each project they think worthwhile. There's very little about why or how they did a certain piece. Most pages have a single paragraph on the piece shown, which usually isn't very informative.It's useful to get the names of design studios so you can go to their web sites and look at some good portfolios, but beyond that I'm not sure what else to do with it. It's mildly inspirational, but with so many web sites offering video clips of great pieces, it's difficult for me to get excited about screenshots. A CD with the pieces shown on the pages, would have enhanced the value of the book."
3,Good Movie,I remember this movie and wanted to see it again but you can't go back. Time does make a difference. Not that it's a bad movie. It's just ok.
3,what about Billy McNamara's nude scene?,Forget about Erika and concentrate on cute Billy's buns and abs. Erika is an amazon and Billy is the real interest in this movie because of his fine looks and nonchalant acting. He is well worth the price of this item.
5,Whats going on,School mouse is a awsome book with a slow start i would recomend this book for all ages. It is about a school full of mice they are called school mice they are mainly owned by the parents Ragged Robin and Hiasenth. It is a great book.
5,Great sun coverage,"This did a great job of keeping my daughter covered and protected from the sun - she wore it all day on the beach. It dries easily and the colour looks cuter in real life. My daughter is 20months so the sleeves were long on her, but she'll grow into them. Great price too!"
4,merchant delivers on promised product,"It was a good bulb at a good price. Shipping was excellent.Improvement:More LEDs in a bulb for the same cost would be nice.How about a 150 LED bulb for $29.95???Now that would be worth it!Exterior usage: I recommend at least a 225 LED for $49.95..A good merchant overall, he delivers what he states.Will buy again from this merchant!"
3,Good for an LED Lamp,This bulb puts out light the equivalent of about a 25 watt bulb. Good construction and it is shaped like a tradiional bulb making it useful for clip-on shade lamps.
4,easy to use and helpful,"i bought this journal about a year ago and it took some time for me to finally use it. but, once i did, i recognized it's usefulness in enabling me to lose weight. i couldn't give it five stars however because of several factors: a) it comes apart too easily, b) although its size is convenient to carry, it doesn't leave much room to write, and c) related to b, a little more space for notes would be nice.in summation this little journal met my expectations. the calorie counter in the back was very helpful as well."
5,Better than the ads!,I ordered 2 bicycle seats for my husband & I; we love these seats. They are better than stated in the description. We feel that we made an excellent choice.
5,"Heroic, realistic","Wonderful plots. John Drake is a genuine hero in a not-always-clear and not-always-fair world. He does his best to be true to his values. I especially like ""A Man to Be Trusted"" -- the plot about a third-world election is very ingenious and would apply today.Fun to watch on DVD where you can back up and slow-mo the stunts. Look at the scene where Drake turns over the dinner table in ""Have a Glass of Wine"" -- the actor playing the villain subtlely helps McGoohan flip the table! <smile>Many of the actors became stars and are familiar to us in British drama and comedy. But wonderful acting in even the smallest roles. I especially remember Drake's expatriot widowed landlady in ""A Man to Be Trusted""Heroic and realistic, too"
5,"Exellent book, written with clarity and dry humour","I was lucky enough to find the hardback edition of this book being sold really cheaply and I`ve never regretted buying it. It deals with the full breadth of the `fringe' phenomena. The book is very well written and by turns, informative, amazing and amusing. Dash walks a tightrope between impartiality and outright scepticism. Particularly amusing is the way he completely demolishes the legend of the Loch Ness monster. There is such a wealth of information here that I seem to get something new out of his book each time I read it. I don't agree all his conclusions, especially the one about UFOs being a product of `fantasy prone' individuals but most of the time he seems to hit the target dead centre. Essential reading for those interested in strange phenomena."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Unfortunately this program does not deliver. Supported applications are so limited that you will find no use for CrossOver outside of running Internet Explorer on your Mac. Sorry, but paying almost sixty bucks to run IE is not worth it in my opinion. All applications I have tried running with CrossOver are not supported. I'll take the time to install them, but then they will not run. If Leopard didn't run as slow as molasses on my iMac, I would install it and use Boot Camp instead of even wasting my time on trying to get CrossOver to work. Apple, please hurry up with Snow Leopard so I can get my Boot Camp back!"
2,Good for 3 years and then it broke.,"I was very happy with the unit for several years, until the pivot where the TV comes down loosened up and eventually, detached.I took the unit down and opened it up an saw that the pivot mechanism attaches the screen to the unit with four little screws. If I would have tightened that screw in time , everything would have been fine. But when the screen detached, it must have put too much force on the wires and now there is sound but no picture."
5,Too cute,"it is so hard to find African American dolls for toddlers. This one is great. My niece loves it. Best of all it's washable...good thing since she takes it everywhere, including outside. I would recommend this doll to other aunts looking for a great first doll for a little girl."
2,highly annoying user interface,"I bought the bridge for my AVR 645. While it looks sleek and the sound quality is not bad, the ipod navigation through the OSD is extremely non intuitive. Trying to navigate with the remote is even worse. I would have been better off just connecting my computer to the AVR 645 through the USB input."
4,the best out there,"amazin way to hook up yr home theater to yr IPOD, all menus pop up on yr receiver unfortunately they scroll so u cant see all details at once.but the convenience of not having to leave yr couch is a super plus."
1,Don't plan on scrolling,"The interface is pathetic. If you have a large library you won't be able to scroll even remotely quickly. I have about 20 GB of songs, and it takes me literally five minutes to scroll all the way through to the end. Works if you only want to play one of a few playlists, but you would be better served to get a charging cradle and a mini/rca out to connect to one of the other inputs, then use the iPod's controls to play the music."
3,good but frustrating,I'll make this as short and to the point as possible. The bridge for the most part works fanatstic. The ONE REALLY FRUSTRATING thing is that everytime i connect the ipod and move the select button on the receiver to bridge the same song starts everytime. I have the ipod on shuffle but the same song starts everytime which is the very first song alphabetically on the ipod. anyone know how to stop this from happening other than deleting this song? i think i've tried everything.thanks!
3,"calidad excelent, product deficient...!!!","This product can only be used to listen to the music of his Ipod, but does not play video. I bought for my home theater system to view the video on my iPod and take a one-touch all my digital content but do not achieve this with accessories. You may only be useful for earlier versions of the iPod classic. What if it succeeds is able to control the music from artists, most recently heard, albums, etc.. by remote control receiver harman kardon.I recommend that you only get if you just have iPod 5.5 or less, since I bought it thinking that all civil servant to my iPod classic and I failed to see the videos."
5,Timepiece,TimepieceRichard Paul EvansThis book is beautifully written with lessons of forgiveness and love that will touch the hearts of every reader.
2,going digital,"Sony is known for quality and if you're looking for the simplest voice recorder, this is it.But if you're looking for a voice recorder with more to offer, go with Sony's digital.I returned my original order for the Sony digital voice recorder which offers many nice options the former does not have and am perfectly satisfied."
2,sunglasses,"These glasses were not up to my expectations, the lens resembled plastic instead of glass like what was advertised. Would not recomend to buy."
2,No insights into cancer experience,"I don't mind 'sassy' heroines, even where they're overdrawn and romanticised, but this is just silly. The connections between characters are ridiculously implausible, as is the plot and many little details. (In a remote cabin in the woods, Blair 'presses a button' for self-administered morphine but the iv equipment must have just appeared and hooked up to her all by itself.) If you've had cancer or you're living with someone with it, and you're examining your own experience, avoid this book; it doesn't offer any insights at all into living with a life-threatening disease or learning how to die.Get _Love Life_ by Ray Kuun instead."
5,The Piano Man at his recent best. You won't be dissappointed.,"I have been following Billy Joel for most of my life, and have seen many of his concerts and all of the video releases of him. This was an awesome concert, and the DVD captures is well.You won't be disappointed."
2,On DVD No Bonus Feature,"Recently purchased this DVD and thought the concert was electrifying. Great sound and the picture was amazing.Complaint : There is no BONUS PERFORMANCES!!! No Steve Tyler, Roger Daltrey, or John Mellencamp. Not to be found on this DVD."
1,BAD AUDIO on BLU RAY,"Be careful....no bass content and a damaged mix on disc. This has been noted elsewhere. 2.1 mix has bass, but that's it. Don't buy until this is fixed!"
1,george jones friends,i ordered this dvd in may for my son birthday which was this month but when he went to play it there seems to be nothing on it the dvd seems to be blank not very happy as i order a lot of stuff7i
4,Expensive but good,This is a solid piece of gear. very heavy. This works as expected. I did have to sand down the ridges left from casting to keep from cutting up my snatch strap. Nice shackle included. Could be cheaper and not bright silver.
1,is an ink eater,"This printer takes sooo much ink.the only feature that's great is the scanner, but it only scans if you have ink."
3,A regular commedy,"This movie is a commedy.Even using a good cast, this movie misses the target, many times.Using a real caracter - Dr. John H. Kellogg- as a source to a fiction, this movie is a regular commedy, but fat from amomg the best commedies available, to see.This movie was made, following a book with the same name.I didn't read the book, but this movie is just regular."
2,"WORTH SEEING ONCE, THAT'S ABOUT IT!!!",I saw THE ROAD TO WELLLVILLE although I thought ANTHONY HOPKINS was great as DR KELLOGG I just found the the rest of the cast like MATTHEW BRODERICK and BRIDGET FONDA to be uninteresting and dull although I do admit DANA CARVEY has his moments that make you laugh. It's not enough to compensate for the above. Also the story is a little weak too and sometimes confusing in what way it is I won't say just watch and find out. I'd like to recommmend THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE but I find I can not.
4,"A refreshing look at ""Alternative Medicine""","Granted, THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE may not be one of my absolute favorites, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Considering some of the quasi-medical gadgets and assorted ""cures"" that are still being peddled to people today, this movie was quite refreshing. While the scatological references might have been a bit too much, they nonetheless reflected the obsessions and fetishes of many health gurus of the period with surprising accuracy. Although fiction, THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE was based a true story, which makes the whole tale a bit more disturbing - but also a bit more humorous.NOTE: For those who saw the movie, the Texas town of Glen Rose might have had its own version of Dr. Spitzvogel in the person of one Dr. Milling, a ""magnetic rubbing"" practitioner who was gunned down by a female patient's husband - possibly out of jealousy. Something to think about!"
1,Waiting and waiting......,"This item showed as ""available"" when I ordered and after 20 days still no sign of receiving anytime in the near future. Doesn't really matter if I'm getting a good price on the formula if I DON'T ACTUALLY RECEIVE THE FORMULA! This vendor's supply chain management is completely inadequate judging by the other complaints. My baby will be eating steak and potatoes at college by the time I receive this item...."
1,Where is it ???????????????????????????????????????,I ordered this on May 12th. It was available. Now the estimated shipping is June 9 - June 27th. Will someone at Amazon please contact me a tell me what is going on! This is very unlike Amazon to treat their customers like this!
1,wrong image,"image shows nutramigen lipil,but the product is enfamil lipil.these are two different products.i had to return the order."
5,Velvet Acid Christ comes for your blood,"Velvet Acid Christ is my favorite band, the first CD I ever heard by them is Twisted Thought Generator (TTG), it and Fun with Knives (FWK) are my top favorite, but there is nothing that I really don't like that has been done by VAC. Hex Angel though was a disappointment for me, it just didn't have that VAC cathiness that kept me coming back for more. So I was kind of weary upon listening to Lust for Blood. Though it might lack the trance stylings of FWK and TTG it is a well thought out, well put together CD that topples what Hex-Angel was. This album is a dark, broody, elegant musically feast. Some of the songs just send chills up my spine. Some of the songs remind me of older VAC from Fate and Pestilence. This goes on to prove that VAC can still make good music time and time again, while keeping it fresh and new."
3,Disappointing,"Most of the music on this album is very good, however, the vocals and lyrics leave a lot to be desired. The vocals are distorted because let's face it, Bryan can't sing or write good lyrics. Another low point is movie samples. There is nothing more pleasant than hearing low quality samples with background noise, and static in your music. The worst song is ""Lust"" - same guitar riff for 3 minutes, and very uninspired lyrics. The instrumental tracks are excellent though."
5,If you liked Scout from to Kill a Mockingbird...,you'll fall in love with Mina Pereira. Suneeta Peres da Costa captures the ideas and world of a child using very adult language to express it.This book is for anyone who remembers being a kid and being frustrated with any part of the world.
2,Gangster Story is awful. Beat the Devil is watchable.,"Walter Matthau said that his film ""Gangster Story"" was probably the worst film ever made. I think he was right. Terrible story, terrible acting, and it probably cost $ 50 to make. ""Beat the Devil"" is interesting to see, since it's a cult film. One bad feature - the synchronization of the speech is off - the actors speak, and you hear what they say with just a very slight delay. It's very slight, and it's not so bad that it ruins watching the film, but it IS a small irritant to see them speak and have the sound not match their lip movements. (The film didn't do much for me, but many people think it's great.)"
3,RENTAL FOR SURE!,"This movie was okay... saw it in theaters. Did not care for it much. It was actually very slow in most parts, and was boring for me. I am a big MW fan, however this movie does not cut it for me. Definately will not be in my movie library. Check out Shooter, Invincible, Fear, Four Brothers, Rockstar, or the Italian Job for MW movies!"
5,Saw it in the theatre! Was Fantastic!!!,"As a fan of the Max Payne games, I was sceptical when I first heard about this movie as I didn't want the great memories to be ruined. Eventhough, they flooded every TV station with trailers which I had to see 100's of times before I actually saw the movie, I was still greatly surprised by what it had to offer. It followed the storyline pretty close to the game and the action sequences were well put together, especially the slow motion scenes! I also really liked the beating heart sound effects (just like in the game) when he was dreaming, and when Max is on V it's pretty trippy! I can't wait to see what it's like on Blu-Ray!"
1,WTF,I was very upset with Mark Wahlberg. He is far to good of an actor to be doin some stuff like this. The best thing in the movie was the graphics. The acting in this movie was more then horrible. It was so bad that I cant even think of a word it could've been. The way the vilian died seemed to simple. And the way the people were dying was not graphic enough. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. It gives the game a bad name. It did not do the game any justice at all.
3,Close to a pain to watch,"My son warned me about this movie, but it was too late, I had purchased it already. Usually I rent until I know but I thought Mark Wahlberg, oh well live and learn."
4,Max Payne the movie NOT as good as Max Payne the Game....,"Still, it was ok, but Mark Wahlberg did not bring the same 'graphic novel dark humor' from the games to the big screen... decently done from a dark crime adventure perspective, but lacking the character developement, the icy demeanor, the constant dark train of thought, the grim memories of living joy and love lost of the game character. In comparison it seemed somewhat cold and bleak, lifeless and detached... I did not get the impression I was watching the same guy I had gotten to know in Max Payne and Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne, A Film Noir Love Story..."
5,Brilliant piece of installation art!,"First saw this piece at the Hirshhorn Museum, and I just had to see if I could find a DVD to take back home to show my family. This is a fantastic chain-reaction, cause/effect, law-of-inertia piece of art! It's mesmerizing to watch."
3,It's a good reminder to watch the movie,"I guess the fact that I haven't bought many soundtracks (if any) played a part in not knowing what to expect from this soundtrack - or if maybe I expected too much. It makes sense that the songs from a movie (not sure if they were made specifically for the movie, but it'd make sense) aren't terrific as stand-alone songs when listening to the cd. What I mean is that there are some good songs, La Valse D'Amelie, in particular and its variants, but it's not a cd that's just good to listen to on its own. It definitely brings to mind scenes from the movie, and if that's what a soundtrack is supposed to do, then it does a wonderful job. The songs also seem a bit too short - La Valse D'Amelie (Orchestra Version), for example, is only 2 minutes - so in that respect it leaves you hanging a bit..I'd give it three stars just for the fact that it makes me think of the fantastic movie. As a cd: eh."
2,Not so hot,"The only real problem with this puzzle was the shape of the letters on it. I'm 30 years old and couldn't tell is the small b was a d or p or even a q etc... The W could be an M or E. Too confusing. I wish they had done some pattern or something on the letters to tell them apart. Also, with a big puzzle like this, it should of been magnatized! It's hard to pick up so many puzzles each time my 3 yr old feels like dumping them over! UGGG"
2,Missed the mark on this one.,"We had this on our wish list and are big Melissa and Doug fans. However, I just saw it in a store and some of the letters are really misshapen. I think this is a BIG problem when the purpose of the toy is to teach letter recognition! We, sadly, took it off our list."
1,Shewd smear of the Vietnam War soldier.,"Looking for a Hero is a cleverly written book that takes well researched information and twists it in such a way as to distort the historical facts and reality of the Vietnam War. The authors would like you to believe that the VC/NVA were the heros and the American soldiers were either fools, suckers, cowards, drunks or anything else but not courageous. I believe the book is nothing more than a slanderous smear of America and its soldiers. If you like read the book and see if you agree with me."
4,More opinions than news,"I really like the global format of The Week; it covers news from all over the world on a wide spectrum of topics, from serious to gossipy. But most of it is in the form of opinions from editorialists and columnists, all of whom have their biases. You can always count on getting two or more contrary opinions on every issue, but you can't count on getting any neutral in-depth analysis. This sometimes leaves me feeling more confused than enlightened - trying to understand the world through opinions can be challenging. Having said that, reading The Week is fun and it will keep you current on domestic and international headline news, and it doesn't hurt to read what people in foreign countries are saying and thinking."
3,Pretty good.,"The stories in this book were quite clever, save for several in which the author seemed to insert the wedding cake as an afterthought."
2,The translation is the worst ever!,"Boy! I like the series, even though there is not much of a story - but the english translation is the worst I have heard in a long time! The translator must have been realy in a bad moode when he did write the script - so much slang from nearly every character is way to much..."
5,The Case For Gun Control!,"The Winchester Double Rifle Case With Wheels is terrific. It excellently stores both rifles and has been a real backsaver for me. The case is sturdy, with retracting wheels, has plenty of handles and rolls like a dream. The Winchester case has been ideal for storing and transporting my rifles. You won't regret getting this one. I'd hate to be without it. I've used myDremel 290-01 1.15 Amp 7,200 Stroke Per Minute Engraver includes Letter and Number Templateto brand it as mine. ~ The Boss"
3,"JOHN CARPENTER, OPUS 18","I've always liked John Carpenter and have been lucky enough to see all his movies fromHalloweenon in theaters. So I'm very sad that The Ward didn't have a proper release in my country. Now, it's true that this film, after a first viewing, may seem a little light in comparison with the average horror movie of the 01's. But it's also true that The Ward gave me the desire to see it again as soon as I would be in the mood for it. What I use to do with all his other movies after all. I've always liked John Carpenter. Recommended."
1,Unhappy,The natural seems like it is just unpainted plywood. Maybe it looks better in the painted version. It is made well and holds puzzles as described
3,Does the job,"This puzzle case fits the Melissa and Doug small peg puzzles I have, which was my biggest goal. It is pretty ugly and cheaply constructed for the price."
3,Not for chunky puzzles,"This is a great way to keep all of my daughters regular size puzzled organized, but the Melissa & Doug ""chunky"" puzzles did not fit. The puzzle pieces are too thick for the slots. I plan on painting it since it looks like dirty cardboard (it seems durable, just very industrial-looking), and I didn't loke the primary colors of the other version. Overall, it's a great idea, but it would be nice if some of the slots were adjustable."
1,Avoid,I bought one and found a cut on the power cord. Returned it and found another gash on the power cord of the replacement. I think the way they package this product was the cause of the damages.
5,hell,"This seasoning is fantastic for making bloody marys ! Once I found it, nothing else will do. The fact that its salt free is a huge plus, too."
2,Super Hot It is Not,"Being labeled ""habanero"" and said to be from ""hell,"" I figured this has to pack some killer heat. But what a disappointment. It's a bit hot if you pour a lot of this on, but no hotter than any other chili pepper seasoning. The flavor of habanero is moderate, but I bought it to make my mouth sizzle. It comes in a nice tin (similar to black pepper tins at the supermarket) and has good labeling.Another negative is that it's clumping inside the tin - when I shake it I hear a big clump banging back and forth. I'm not sure of its freshness - perhaps its been sitting in storage for years."
4,SEASONING FROM HELL,WE USE SEASONING FROM HELL WHEN WE MAKE HOT CHICKEN WINGS.. GIVES THEM A LITTLE KICK (BAM).. WE ALSO USE THIS SPICE IN JUST ABOUT ALL DISHES WE MAKE (NO SALT AND PEPPER NEDED)..
1,Never Again,I spent about 2 weeks tweaking the colors and getting it just perfect and then a week later it died. The carriage ran itself to the far end and began to make a loud grinding sound. Tech support is a long distance call and has banker's hours so good luck getting through.
2,Painful,"This movie is a disappointing contribution to the horror genre. There are a lot of sylistic parallels to the exorcist but without the punch. It tries to move in the same quiet pace and with the same tension, but does not pull it off. There is a lot of filler and not enough plot devices to keep it moving. The acting is wooden given the realism this movie was aiming for. Hammer movies are much better off as pure vampire movies. Christopher Lee is not very convincing as a heretic priest."
5,Marked for Death,"I have been a Steven Seagal fan from the beginning.Overall I think this is one of his better movies,if you like a movie with some black magic. Myself I don't really care to much as long as there is alot of kickin butt and good action...If Seagal is in the movie I watch it."
3,No Oscars Here - But Pretty Decent Action,"If you can get past the racial stereotypes and some pretty ludicrous special effects, then ""Marked for Death"" is not a bad film for this genre. Seagal is actually pretty convincing as the Ex FBI Agent out to clean up his neighborhood from the crack dealing ""posse."" The leader of the Jamacian ""posse"" is a nasty dude called Screwface who weilds a machete like Martha Stewart with a potato pealer. Expect broken bones, plenty of punches, a decapitation or two, the typical bad guy flying out of a window and smashing on top a car, and even an unfortunate cop who did'nt look behind him and is turned into a shishkabob by Screwface."
2,NOT REALLY ALL THAT GOOD,"A FORMER COP [STEVEN SEAGAL] GOES AFTER SOME LOCAL JAMAICAN DRUG DEALERS. THIS WAS AN UTTERLY DISSAPOINTING FILM, BEING THAT ''ABOVE THE LAW'' WAS SO GOOD. HAS THE USUAL SHOOTOUTS AND THE USUAL CAR CHASES THAT ONE WOULD EXPECT TO FIND IN A STEVEN SEAGAL MOVIE. DIEHARD SEAGAL FANS [WHICH IS WHAT I AM, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT] MIGHT LIKE IT. OTHERS SHOULDN'T EVEN WASTE THEIR TIME."
3,Not really a must have,"As goes for the second part of this compilation as well: one does not really have to own it. Would she have put the best tracks of each volume one one album, it would have been sufficient. But as it is, both part can not really satisfy. Especially the remixes are a real mood-killer. There are a few nice tracks on each volume, especially the live recordings. But the rest really is no good. So the average fan should stick to Sarah regular albums, there is no single miss among those."
3,A Full Range Of Music and Emotion,"As others have so eloquently detailed already, this album explores Sarah's full range of talents. Some songs really shine, such as ""Gloomy Sunday"" and ""Fear"", even though some really didn't grab my interest, as in the remix of ""Posession"" and a few other. But it's an interesting variety, the songs that do pull it off; even controversial such as the ""Dear God"" track.And as to that, anyone who thinks ""Dear God"" is an atheist song obviously isn't the sharpest tool in the shed. A true atheist wouldn't bother with a letter to someone who they didn't think existed. About only thing worse than a self-rightous religous fanatic are the atheists who use them as an excuse. (Don't mistake publicity for reality.)/\ - Insert next rant above and happy listening."
5,From gems and art to antiques and handcrafts,"Ron & Caryl Krannich's Treasures And Pleasures Of Rio And Sao Paula explores two popular Latin cities, revealing their shopping opportunities from gems and art to antiques and handcrafts. From planning the trip to observing shopping rules of the region, Treasures And Pleasures Of Rio And Sao Paula provides important information."
3,She's the maid of steel,I am not about to tell you that this is a great movie. OK? But with Faye Dunaway as the villaness and Peter O'toole as Jor El's brother it has to have it's moments. If nothing else if you have all of Superman's movies how can you not have Supergirl. I just can't believe there has been no sequel or a movie with both superman & supergirl.
3,Magic,"It was ok not great, story could have been done or written better..... don't really care for all the magic in it."
5,I couldn't look away...,"...It was like seeing an atomic bomb drop in slow motion. I loved every minute of this stinker from my childhood. Helen Slater is cute (and whatever happened to her? I guess after this and ""The Legend of Billie Jean"" everyone probably assumed she was destined for obscurity) and totally lacking in motivation; Brenda Vacarro (gotta LOVE the scream.. her performance here may even be better than her one in ""Zorro, the Gay Blade"") and Faye Dunaway are camp-champs; and while battling to the death over a gardener may not work for The X-Men, it works here. Feminism gone horrible awry. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEAS PLEASE watch this DVD to make sure we never forget... the horror... that was... SUPERGIRL.BWHAH-HAH-AHHA-HAHA-HAHAH!"
3,Supergirl,"Camp fun fest; worth seeing for Peter O'Toole refusing to phone it in, even though he obviously knows what a piece of crap he's in. Faye Dunaway and Brenda Vaccaro at campy best and Peter Cook doing god knows what.Helen Slater would have been a great Supergirl if they had bothered to do this for real within the decades Superman franchise. As it is, she acquits herself admirably among Oscar winners and the debacle of the film she's in."
3,"Not a great movie, but superb flying effects!","The first time I saw this movie, I was very disappointed, because it didn't have heart like the superman films. Kidnapping Supergirls boyfriend isn't exsactly the same as stealing nuclear weapons, like Lex Luthor!However, the special effects in this movie are stunning!! The scene with Supergirl and the monster at the end isn't a good special effect shot, but the rest of them are superb! They make it hard to believe that this movie was made 17 years ago, because the special effects are so realistic!The optical flying ballet shots are my favorites. The only thing bad is that you can't see her reflection in the water when she's flying over it.For special effects fans, this movie is a must have, and it's also good for hot summer night or rainy afternoons."
2,HELEN SLATER,She is the only reason to even view this mess. Not enough time spent with Helen's character! Hard to get through. Too much Faye Dunaway. A big was of time.
1,DO NOT GET THIS VERSION! Get the Supergirl Limited Edition!,"DO NOT GET THIS VERSION! Get theSupergirl (Limited Edition)release instead, even if only a used copy. Only in theSupergirl (Limited Edition)release do you get the ""European"" version (on the second disk), which is actually the complete movie, before it was tampered with and gutted out by the studio executives. This is the version that makes presents a coherent story, because it develops the plot and characters."
2,Superman without the drama.,"After a stone vital to the survival of her people is lost, Kara travels to earth to find it and discovers she has incredible powers whilst on the blue-green sphere.A nice attempt at anti-sexism, but sadly this film falls flat. Whilst the effects are impressive and there are some good performances, it just seems too much like a cash-in. Supergirl herself comes across as pretty twee and melodramatic and the evil Selina is too campy to be frightening.Not completely terrible, but it just doesn't stand out as anything bold or dramatic."
2,Supergirl,"I feel this movie is hot! This is one of my two top movies. The other is Elvira, Mistress of the Dark. These are hot movies!"
3,Nothing wrong with this but kind of a yawn,"Nothing wrong with this but nothing that great either. This got a major push from the record company as a Santana-style all-star collaboration and the record buying public yawned. The fact that it is selling used on Amazon for $1.02 may be some kind of record for hype to bargain bin.Curiously, the best thing to come out of this album is a B-side from one of the CD singles called ""Blue"". Check it out.Items of interest concerning the record company-generated hype that surrounded this release:1. The Daily Show did a hilarious burn on Mick by showing a close-up still of his face from one of the videos from the record side-by-side with a recent close-up of his face taken in public: One face smooth as a 29 year old and the other as craggy as an ancient sea captain2. Jann Wenner proved himself a sad, sad, sycophant when he personally reviewed this in Rolling Stone and called it a five star classic and generally spewed unmerited praise all over this mediocre album"
1,keep away from this!!!,"some heavy bands like Deep Purple, King Crimson or Uriah Heep are the rolling stones's contemporaries! but they are still able to create the new studio albums for thier long time ago fans like us!Jagger is not able anymore to create his new album, there are no good studio songs in the new album. This might call an unsatisfied ego!"
2,POOR ELVIS....,"The CD Cover of this Jagger album brings Jagger as Elvis, in a clear reference to the ELVIS PRESLEY STATUE (""THE KING OF ROCK AND ROLL"") placed inside the Memphis Visitor Center -TN.The problem is that Jagger doesn't have the voice, neiher the soul and passion of the KING.The CD sounded simply too commercial ... As phony as a three dollar bill...The tracks are mild-tempered and the ballads definitely dont work... Mick J. can make better than this...Yes folks, ""money makes the world go round..."""
3,Mick in the Middle,"Well, to take exception to some not so impartial media reviews, this is not The Great Mick Jagger Solo Album. That was ""Wandering Spirit"" released and pretty much ignored in 1993. If you don't have it, buy it first. As for ""Goddess"", it certainly has its moments but like Mr. Jagger, there are a few too many personas for the space occupied. The same scattering of lackluster ballads that dog most latter day Stones albums, but also minus any overpowering air guitar moments (sorry Pete T.)."
1,buy deep purple newest album! avoid this!,"yes this is a result of unsatisfied ego of Stones's Boss.Deep Purple, another contemporary classic heavy rock band from the 70's still surprise everyone until today with their latest Album bananas 2003. But Jagger ?? he is only looking forward to the money, business and fame!!!! nowadays he rarely surprises everyone! Deep Purple still do their best by making anew album! because they are still attempting musically ""how one still makes a good sound in a album for 2003. Rolling Stones never think about it!"
1,No Expectations,"Jeez, where to start with this review? I heard this album over the holiday and I can say that I almost cried because it was so poor. I believe this thing is a producer's album and that Jagger only spent a second looking at the lyrics that someone else penned and then recorded this shlockfest. If this album were even on par with ""Satanic Majesties..,"" it would be good. This album stinks. Keef would roll in his grave if he were dead. Stick with ""Exile On Main Street."""
4,Where's the ginger?,"I'm not a connoisseur of chocolate, but I can tell this is a quality product - dark, smooth, not bitter, nor overly sweet. However, I do love ginger, and was disappointed that this does NOT have juicy chunks of ginger inside. Instead, it has a mild ginger zing that is perhaps too subtle to be noticed unless one is looking for it. Not bad, just not what I was looking for."
2,review,this movie was ok it wasnt the kind of movie I thought it would b it just wasnt haunted enough or even scary. kind of a lame movie actually.
2,don't recommend,"This conditioner doesn't do it for me. It's very expensive for such a small quantity. Texture is thin. Love the scent, hence two stars."
1,Arrived broken,Mickey was detached from the face. Returned immediately...so far (almost two weeks) no credit received.
3,A long voyage and a long read,"Charles Wilkes was a new name to me and his mid 19th century voyage was somtheing I knew nothing about. He led his little fleet on an epic voyage: he explored Antartica, charted the Pacific Ocean and explored the area that is now the states of Oregon and Washington. I am glad that I read about it but a condensed version would have been enough for me."
3,"Too Much Dramatics, Too Little History","This book had the potential of being a rather interesting tale in the style of Undaunted Courage, the Stephen Ambrose classic about the Lewis and Clark expedition. Unfortunately the author chose to put much of the focus on the continuous bickering and infighting between the leader of the expedition and his subordinates. While some discussion of this would of course have been appropriate, it forms the main theme of the book and barely a page goes by without some Kitty Kelly like ""who hates whom"" revelations. The author also tends to skip over things like how the ships were operated or provide more descriptive details of the places visited. Not recommended unless you want more human drama (and dramatics) and less history."
4,Are any all that quiet?,"Not that quiet, but is that possible? There is no leaking, very easy to clean and an all around smart machine. I am very happy with it."
4,"Works superb, but where are the repacement pads?","I have been using HWM450 for the last 3 months, and it works fine. But where in the world can I find replacement mineral absorption pads for this model? I bought this model from Home Depot, but they are out of pads. Amazon is out of pads. Kaz does not sell them. Internet search did not get anything either!I am planning on trying the round pads from Slant/Fin and see if they do the trick. One tip: If they fit, I am buying them in bulk! :-)Thanks,Julia S."
5,Humidifier works great,"This is the only model of humidifier that we use.Helps greatly to reduce dryness in house, caused by winter heating.Supplier kept all promises."
4,Satisfied,This humidifier has worked well and has all the features that I wanted. The room humidity read out takes a long time to adjust but other wise works well. It has been easy to clean and use.
4,Works well,"I have had this humidifier for a few weeks now, and it has certainly helped with the static and dryness in my apartment. It is generally quiet and does its job well. So why did I only give it 4/5? Two tiny reasons prevent this product from being perfect. First, the cap on the water tank is somewhat hard to get screwed on straight, and after about a week I can no longer get it to seal tightly. I have to carry it cap side up after I fill it, and then quickly flip it into the humidifier when I replace it. Second, when you unplug the humidifier to clean it, it loses any settings you have set and reverts to the defaults when you plug it back in. Not a huge deal, since there aren't that many settings, but it would have been nice if they had put in a little flash memory to save the settings so you wouldn't have to keep resetting them."
1,Short life span,"After throughly researching and taking the recommendation of consumer reports we purchased this humidifier. We had a good run for two months, although the humidistat was not accurate. Then the trouble started...we changed the filters, maintained it properly. When the humidifier was turned off or stopped when the humidity level reached it's desired level the unit slowly drains all the water out from the bottom. We have been unable to get the unit replaced or repaired."
1,Died quickly,"While it worked, it worked well. But after a couple of months it simply stopped turning on. Now Kaz wants me to send it back under warranty for a replacement that will take 6-8 weeks. As I said to them, winter will be over in 6-8 weeks. VERY disappointed."
2,Broke within a few months,"The second winter I began to use this, it broke early on. Plus, even with the recommended maintenance, mineral deposits collected, which is what I think ultimately broke it. This time I'm going to try Crane's cool mist humidifier, hoping for better."
3,Nice humidifier,"I've been using this humidifier for about a month now and it's still working like the first day I got it. The unit is super easy to use if you want just the on-off feature. It starts producing a mist very quickly after you turn it on. One re-fill of the tank will last about 8-9 hrs when running the entire time.There are two downsides to this unit.First is that I can't re-fill the unit while it is still running since the refill valve is at the bottom of the tank that you detach to bring to the sink. When I bought this, I thought it wouldn't matter, but it does.Second, there is usually a little bit of spillage as I remove and install the tank because of water that's caught in the crevices of the re-fill cap."
4,"Work nicely, big tank, little noisy","So far it's working out good. Works pretty fast, water tank is pretty big. Little noisy thought, but once you fall sleep, hard to notice. I would recommend this."
3,Needs weekly cleaning,"Not a bad piece of equipment, The main thing to keep in mind is you recommended to clean the scale off the heating unit once a week, purchase the largest container of clear vinegar available and soak everything for 10-15 then wipe off with a cloth. Plus there is the issue of buying mineral absorbing pads for it as well. If I had it to do over, I would probably buy this unit, easy to assemble, multi-fan speed, and gets the job done (the most important thing)."
3,Do not purchase this unit,"While the performance of the unit has been satisfactory, we unfortunately have hard water which requires frequent changing of the mineral absorption pads - required to run the unit efficiently as it keeps hard water deposits from the heating plate.The unit is manufactured by a company named Kaz but is sold under the Honeywell name. The instructions say to contact Kaz to order new pads. I have contacted them twice to order new pads and each time, they say they are out of them and will get them in ""next month."" I have since seen several reviews indicating this same problem. Therefore, the options are to either purchase mineral water and fill the unit with that or clean the unit EVERY DAY.I recommend going with another brand - one in which you know will be supported by the manufacturer and not render the unit virtually useless."
1,The worst humidifier ever,"I am really disapointed with this humidifier. It's pretty pricy and doesn't work properly. I bought the humidifier last winter, used for about 4 months and stored it throughout spring and summer. This fall, last week, when I tried to use it again, the humidifier started leaking. I turned it on and when it reached the humidity set, it stoped working (as it should be). But then, when the steam stops, the humidifier starts leaking and makes a mess in the room. There is water all over the table and the floor, etc. I am throwing it away and will defenetly go with a different brand now."
1,"Even at $23.15, this was a waste of money.","I bought this humidifier because it was on sale for a bargain price of $23.15, or so I thought. The first problem was that it was very difficult to clean the scales off of the heating element, and the cleaning instructions were anything but informative. The second--and fatal--problem was the handle of the water tank. Less than 4 months after I purchased the humidifier, I was carrying a full tank of water back to my room when the handle broke off, sending the tank plummeting to the floor where it broke and flooded the carpet. If not for that fatal problem, I would have probably rated this item 3 or 4 stars, since it did do a decent job of humidifying my room. Unfortunately, a broken tank = a useless humidifier."
4,Working fine,"Very pleased with this humidifier. The tank is easy to fill and I really like its operation. I'm comfortable with the humidity at 35%, but you can set it as high as 55%. When you first start the machine, you have to set the desired humidity since there's no memory function; but, once set, it works really well. The unit will typically run until the ambient humidity is +- 2% from the desired setting and then shut off. I haven't been able to find Honeywell replacement mineral pads; but there are similar pads available on Ebay. I don't mind the slight ""gurgling"" sound at all. The switches are a little flimsy."
4,Honeywell HWM450,"This is a good, easy to use humidifier. It does make some noises that take getting used to while trying to fall asleep but has three different settings that can quiet it down. It also has a timer to turn it off after 1hr to 18hrs (increments by 1hr). I also got mineral absorption pads (HMP-12P) with the humidifier. I have hard water and need to clean the humidifier and change the pad less than every 2 weeks. It has a LCD display that constantly shows the relative humidity. It can be set to turn off between 25% and 65% humidity (increments of 1%). Easy to set up, easy to maintain, digital buttons make it easy to control. Great Product."
1,Leaky and dangerous,"I had to toss it because more water would dribble out of the base than would end up in the air, and I had to either choose between soaking wet floors or electrocution if I put the humidifier in a container to keep the liquid off the carpet. Based on the other reviews I guess I just had bad luck, but with other humidifiers I've owned before this I've never had such a problem."
1,Terrible product,"I normally don't write reviews, but this product was so bad, I felt I had to warm other potential buyers. I threw it away after about 4 weeks, because I unfortunatley did not keep the box to return it, and I couldn't stand it in my house any more, it was such a ridiculous design. The power did not work well, kept switching on and off, there was immediately green mold that collected in the bottom of the tank .The design was terrible , so in order to refill the tank , you first had to take it out of the humidifier, which had no way to stop the water , so it dripped all over the place and then you had to hold the tank upside down , with no handle to try and fill it up, and then , yep, turned right side up again to put it back into the humidifier it drips all over you , the floor etc. combine that with the green gunk and I am not a happy customer."
1,the thing leaks!,"I was unhappy with this humidifier. Within two weeks of having it, it began to leak and ruined my hardwood floors. I am planning to return it."
2,More like a pamphlet than a book,"This book is very small (34 pgs). Like several other reviewers have noted, don't expect anything more than what you see on the cover. Although some of the figures are cute, they are very ""cartoonish"" rather than realistic. Some good basic piping tips but not as informative as I was expecting."
2,Not Worth The $$,My children received this toy for Christmas and I found it to be a poor value for the price. The yellow knob kept coming off (I finally glued it back on) and it is very difficult for a child to spin.
2,Just OK,"An OK toy, but interest in it wore off fast. I think a regular top would hold interest longer."
3,Solid Gold,"As with every episode, Sharpe's Gold is another escape into Historical Fickion with lots of action to boot."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this book based on the rave reviews it has gotten, but have been grossly let down. Although the author seems to be knowledgeable on the topic of .NET internals, his explanations and book structure are reflective of someone who just wants to show how much he knows, not help you learn. Additionally, good examples are severely lacking.This book is not a good learning book, and at best a mediocre reference book."
2,Not too impressed so far...,"This is my first book from this author, and I don't know why, but I just didn't like it. I thought that there really wasn't a good ""struggle"" in this book, the writing was not as descriptive as other authors' writing, and the characters did not seem as developed. Just an opinion."
5,love her story line,very much enjoy Ms. Pierce's writing style and i am glad she sobeautifully sets out the laws of working with magic...
1,Not well though through,"This has to be one of the most disapointing books the beloved Tamora Pierce has written. I believe the characters where not adhered well enough to the main plot well enough. I don't know, I'm still stuck to Alanna. Well, that's my critics point of view. But anyways, If you're a Tamora Pierce fan, you gotta read this just to keep the ""I READ ALL OF TAMORA PIERCE's BOOKS"" record."
5,Couldn't ask for a better torque wrench,Not only does it work perfectly and accurately but it's beautiful too. The torque wrench fits perfectly in its own case however they could have given you a bigger slot to hold the calibration certificate.
4,Great for the Price,"While I agree with the previous reviewer that the net can be over shot when at 10+ feet and it is best to use lower clubs, it has many positives. For an inexpensive net it does the job. I was able to set it up alone. I was able to hit my long woods at about six feet away. Whether using this one or another net, I recommend it. I am able to hit balls every night after work and then solidify my shots with a bucket of balls. Now don't everyone buy this and drive the price up before I wear this one out :)"
3,"Works Fine, except...","the net works fine, but i hit a couple of shots that got under the net and ricocheted dangerously. I'm trying to figure out how to avoid that outcome (maybe golf swing lessons?). Also, it helps to have a friend to set this up. For the money, though, it's a good deal."
1,extreme disappointment,"pole broke the first time the ball hit the pole. used one day, total waste of money!! i would not recommend to anyone"
4,"Bought it as a gift, Dad loves it.","Tall, solid, nothing special, but he loves it, so nothing less to say about it. Seems to hold well against even more powerful drives. If set up right, seems stable even with mild winds."
2,youll look like ed norton at work the morning after fight club,"I'm happy with the quality of the net. The quality of the poles that hold the whole thing up on the other hand could use some work. The poles a somewhat flimsy in even a slight breeze, the only way to fix this is to stretch the support string and net very tight. End result .... The net becomes like a tennis raquet and if you try to drive the ball into it it flys back at you at extreme speed and you end up with a black eye and near broken nose like I did, even while standing back the recommended 10-12 ft. The only good thing that came from it was my wife whom I was teaching to golf got it all on tape, so while I'm not much for suing maybe I can win a few bucks on Americas funniest home videos"
3,Disappointing,"If you were hoping for ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" that should have been, way back when, it didn't happen here. This version of the Magnificent Ambersons had the advantage of Orson Welles orignial script, but unfortunately not his direction. The tone is never really set. Even without reading the interviews in which Stowe (Isabelle) gives Arau negative reviews you can see she is lost.Gretchen Mol (Lucy), and William Hootkins (Uncle George) come out best. Bruce Greenwood (Eugene) has his moments. I normally like Jennifer Tilly (Fanny) but she was overwrought and all wrong here. Jonathan Rhys Meyers seems out of his depth. He's so glaring, huffy, and self aggrandizing that you can't see why Lucy would fall for him.I hope we do not have to wait another 60 years for a better attempt."
4,A Bit Deceptive,"This book is more academic than practical, which is not a bad thing. I enjoyed reading it and found it to be well researched and very educational. Just remember, however, that any systematic strategy that makes money in the stock market will become ineffective as soon as it becomes well known (anyone remember ""Beating the Dow"" or its offspring, ""The Foolish Four?""). So read this book if the topic interests you, but don't expect to cash in by exploting these anomalies.Also, A Random Walk addresses some of these anomalies and explains why, given transaction costs among other things, one cannot profit from them."
1,Weak Unrealistic Plot,"Story starts off well enough as two inseparable girl friends attend a Carolina college fraternity party that goes bad. One of them, naturally the one who was reluctant to go the party ends up being attacked by drunken brothers and as she tries to save herself she falls out a window and dies. Believe me these nine pages are gripping. It's straight downhill from there. The author seems totally fixated thruout the rest of the book in totally unbelievable characters. There seem to be racists and bigots absolutely everywhere. This was really a painful read to get thru."
3,Great magazine and a great state,"but anyone who says something like ""Idaho holds the torch high when it comes to the themes of cultural diversity ..."" really, really needs to get out more."
4,A VERY FUNNY MOVIE!!,"I hate people who give bad reviews but don't give any reason WHY it deserves a bad review. For my GOOD review of this VERY FUNNY movie, let me just say that the Coen Bros. did a great job in creating odd and u-pleasent situations for these strange charatcers to go through. This was the stranges kind of crime farce. I think it is the Coen's best, although I think many people will argue with me about that. Not a waste of time or money, if you have a good sense of humor. This is a good movie."
5,The True Genius Comedy,"The first time I watched Raising Arizone, I remember being a lot confused and little impressed by the humor. I was 16, and the movie just didn't work for me. I ended up watching a year later. As a 17 year old, I laughed more. Within the next five years, I watched it 15-20 more times. It actually became funnier with each viewing. I can only reference Dr. Strangelove and Monty Python's Holy Grail and Life of Brian as similarly comedic. Nearly every line has the stylished flourish to be quoted verbatim, out of context, and still retain its humor. Don't like Raising Arizona? Watch it again, again, again... the true genius of this film presents itself to those who are willing to put in the effort."
3,Very amusing but not entirely pleasant,"The plot is exceptionally clever, lively, and witty, with lots of surprise twists. But unpleasantly there is the very likable Holly Hunter, who ties herself to a complete loser (making herself a loser too), and the sadness for her spoils much of the fun."
2,"OK, however worst movie by the Coen Brothers","I am a great fan of the coen brother's movies, in fact i'd loved evryone i'd seen, until this. Unfortunately, the comic side of this didn't realy settle with me, and there was only 1 par in which i showed any sign of amusemen (the shop highjacking scene). If you want classic coen brothers, look to fargo, the big lebowski, blood simple etc. They could have done a lot better."
1,A Coen brothers' letdown,"I can't believe that the average review of RA is 4.5 stars. I've purchased hundreds of movies through Amazon the past 3 years and have never written a review but I feel compelled to on this one. This is not a funny movie in the least. Oh, you'll get a couple of chuckles but it certainly doesn't warrant 1.5 hours of your time. The narration of Nicholas Cage needs a MAJOR upgrade - I just couldn't wait until he finished his final one so I could ""shut it down"". And the bounty hunter had no place in this picture - like, where was his story thread any way? The Coen brothers probably want a redo on this puppy - they can (and do) do much better."
2,The first 30 minutes are funny and enjoyable mostly due to tickling and witty dialogues. The rest is boring.,"The first 30 minutes are funny and enjoyable mostly due to tickling and witty dialogues. The rest is boring.**** SPOILER. DO NOT READ this if you HAVE NOT WATCHED the MOVIE ****The film goes south when the two friends of Nicolas escaped from the prison and visited him in his home. Since then, there are only a couples ofhilarious scenes. One is where the boss suggested wife-swapping. The other is when the kids of his boss wrecked his home.It gets worse when the bounty hunter started to track Nicolas down. The imagination is so wild that it's not interesting any more.Anybody who is expecting a child or wants to have one should watch this. It realistically and funnily portraits part of the difficulty of raising a child."
4,Reason for the high price,"The high price is predominately due to the shipping costs as this magazine is produced in the United Kingdom. A subscription over there runs about twenty bucks. However, even with the added expense to get this delivered stateside, iCreate is a great looking magazine with excellent editorials.Top-notch magazine and highly recommended. Just wish Imagine Publishing would recognize the potential of this product and start producing this, as-well-as a few other of their excellent magazines, here in the States."
4,Almost perfect keyboard gigbag,"I bought a Korg SP-250 88-key keyboard and needed a gigbag (I play in an oldies band). After doing a bunch of Internet research, I settled on the Gator GKB-88. It arrived a few weeks ago and I have already used it quite a bit. It does the job really well. It seems to be made of quality materials. To me, it has but one flaw. Once the keyboard is in the bag, the bag and keyboard together probably weigh 40 pounds or so. The bag is carried in one hand by two short handles gripped together. This is a bit heavy and awkward for one hand. The bag would be perfect, especially for the price, if it had a shoulder strap. I may try to fashion one to the bottom of the bag and then carry the bag upside down.Gator 88 Note Keyboard Gig Bag (GKB-88)"
4,Quite a fine production,"This Don Giovanni is not the worst, and it's not the best. But it's about as close as one can get to the top of the list without actually being there. Ruggero Raimondi is a great baritone and too often overlooked (his signature role is Scarpia). His Don Giovanni is given both a fantastic voice, full of expression, and a fantastic actor to back it up. The ""Donnas"" both shine, and their performance alone is worth the price of this DVD.The sound is difficult to deal with--the balance between singers, etc.The filming aspects--cinematography, lighting, sets (oh, the sets!) are all very well done, and the work is as much a success as an opera as it is as a film.My only beef is with Malcolm King's Masetto, which is horribly overdone (and, at least for me, the character whose lip-synching was the most obvious, as everyone else seemed to disguise it well).My advice: buy it."
3,poor sound,"It had everything to become a memorable performance, but the sound spoiled it all. After all what matters most to me is music. Very disappointed!"
4,Marvelous Audio Visual Experience,"This was a fantastic experience for me in that the sum of the parts was greater than the whole. If I had to rate parts individually, I would Rate Cinema effects 3, Audio 2 Acting 3 Singing 3 (because much of it appeared to be lip synched). Nevertheless, the Italian country side views were exquisite! If you compare this work to a visit to La Scala, you'll be diappointed. But if you compare it a good movie, you'll be happy. In this context I rated it a 4 to Amadeus' 5."
1,What a Crock,"Great Concept, Great Price - Hence the Lonely StarNow on my 2nd TV in 12months - and the new one is just going in for its 4th major repair. 1st TV got replaced after 3 major repairs.So far the 2nd TV has had 3 power supplies, 2 new circuit boards, and now it needs a new PDP ....Philips response - ""Deal With It"" ""We're going to repair it aren't we""....Picture fails, Sound fails, Intermittent Red Pixels on black portions of the screen... The list goes on...Good News is that the Service performance has been good, oh and the ambilight works..Dont have a constant picture, but the wall glows nicely.Recommendation: DO NOT BUY THIS TV.. Try another Brand - Yes they may cost more financially, but from my stance I'd pay it in a heartbeat now."
5,Sneaker Pimps meet Fluke,"Melodic electro beats and smooth sultry vocals fitfor the dance floor at the club or in your living room. Tricky combinesthe flavors of Sneaker Pimps Six Underground and the Euro beats of Fluke Risotta and Six wheels.Love to find great new music, even if it just new to me.fullcodemaster"
1,SNAFU,"This air filter was listed as the cabin air filter for my Tundra truck. Not only was it not THE cabin air filter, it was an air filter for the engine and not even a Tundra truck. When I called to return it and explained the problem Amazon immediately sent me a new one, THE SAME AS THE WRONG ONE SENT IN THE FIRST PLACE. I went to nearest auto parts store and bought what I needed and scratched Amazon auto parts from my favorites."
4,It will grow on you....,"The first time I listened to this CD I only liked a couple of songs, and was actually somewhat disappointed with my purchase. I decided to give it another listen, and am glad I did. It grew on me, in fact I walked around long after Chanukah was over singing some of the catchy tunes. If you want tradition - this isn't it, but it sure is a lot of fun, plus a little reggae goes a long way to brightening a winter day!"
4,very impressed,"i have seen alot of anime in my time and i must say that this movie was unlike anything ive seen. im always on the look out for a good animated movie and i saw this one day while browsing through the anime section and was impressed by the packaging, the cover art, and the description on the back. i rushed home to watch it and enjoyed it from the beginning. the art work in this movie is very well done. the colors used really convey the mood of the film. alot of people would find this movie slow. its not for everyone. the sound track is haunting, the story is powerful, and the ending was so shocking that i had to watch it again right after i finished it. the ending made my mouth drop and my eyes tear. very good movie in my opinion."
4,"Good anime, no happy endings.","The animation was pretty good, action was good but the story was a bit slow. I won't disclose the ending, but many Japanese movies, even in animation, seem to carry with them a depressing theme or ending. I've seen other anime that I prefer, but I know many of my friends who swear by this movie. If you're a fan of anime and lots of shooting, I'm sure you'll like this movie."
1,Watching Paint Dry,"It is impossible to say anything negative about the animation here. It's top notch and breathtaking to look at, particularly the use of lighting effects, but that's all this film has going for it. This is an unbearably dull piece of film making. I saw it recently in a theater, and the soundtrack was nearly drowned out by the audience's groans of boredom. The use of ""Little Red Riding Hood,"" which so many reviewers have praised, is simply obnoxious. A small child can easily figure out this connection in the first act, but the film makers, not trusting the audience's intellegence, deems it neccesary to hammer this point into our skulls time and time again. The end result is a flat, emotionally lifeless waste of celluloid. If you want emotion in your anime, pick up ""Cowboy Bebop"" or ""Grave of the Fireflies."" Just stay away from this one."
5,An absolute Classic - 5 Stars,"I've little to add to the other reviews. This is not only a superb anime, but a classic. The english voice-acting and the subtitles are often quite different as it seems great care was taken to make the english dub match the mouth-movements. I found it interesting to watch the dub with the subtitles running to try to catch every bit of information."
3,Be sure to know what you are getting into!,"I am very sorry that I was not prepared for this anime in the slightest. The first time I watched this anime I was expecting a fast paced-action film with a straightforward plot. Instead, what I got was a much slower-paced film that focused on animation rather than character development or excitement. I will admit that the story was interesting, but I couldn't stand how the characters showed little to no emotion throughout the whole film.All in all, stay clear of this film if you are looking for action or adventure, but if you are an otaku, like me, check this one out just for the sake of expanding your horizons."
1,Not enough talent,This is a terrible waste of some interesting ideas. The writer and director once take on more than they can handle with this film. The whole thing is a muddle. The use of the Red Riding Hood fairy tale is clumsy and unnecessary. Rather than deal directly with their subject the writer/director choose to hide behind metaphor.All of the characters are thinly drawn and portrayed with little or no emotion. The film keeps the viewer at a distance by neglecting emotional envolvement.A total waste.
5,Certainly an anime of great depth,"This is a very sort of anime from either the romantic or mecha driven genres. While there is certainly a love story, of a sort, and no shortage of those anime staples hardware and gore, the experience is very much of a modern Japanese or Hong Kong movie transferred to animation.Absolutely worth buying, even (perhaps especially) if you generally don't care for anime.For those who seem a little confused about all the German equipment and organizations: watch the first 5 minutes again. The anime storyline represents an ""alternate history"" in which Germany occupied Japan during WW2. The strong German influence is neither accidental nor affected; it is very much central to the story."
2,More difficult than a textbook,"This book starts out painfully slowly, leading you to believe that when the author gets to the hard stuff, he'll go slowly enough so you can follow him. Bus as soon as he gets to integrals and derivatives, he seems to speed up. I wanted many more simple examples of these basic ideas so I could actually understand how they were being solved. For example, instead of slowly teaching you how to find integrals, he gives three (three!) ""easy"" examples before he adds on sine functions and the like.Look at other calculus books before you buy this one. What would be covered in an entire chapter in a textbook is covered in half of a page here. Idiot's Guide my fanny."
3,Again...not the greatest but decent.,"Yes, Fodor's is an ok travel guide to London, but there are several other options out there that are better choices. The map included is only for the central London area and is not very detailed. The restaurant and hotel recommendations, as everyone is commenting, is mainly upper-crust establishments. But there are reviews of lower end places as well and Fodor's has a great section in the beginning describing what to see if you are spending 2 days, 3 days, etc in the city and giving detailed walks. If you're choosing several travel books for your trip, Fodor's might be a good secondary guide but I wouldn't make this my first choice."
2,"""Not Astrud's Best Hour""","I dearly love Astrud Gilberto. Have almost everything she's ever hadrecorded. This particular recording has been issued, re-issued underabout 20 different versions of cd covers, faces, titles, etc. They allhave Astrud Gilberto listed on the front, but not always the same photoor caption. Same songs on every cd and same versions. For me, the ONLYkeeper on this is the gorgeous rendition of ""Far Away"" with Astrud andthe late, great Chet Baker in a vocal duet. I only wish the whole cdwas up to this standard, but alas, it is not. Those looking for theoriginal ""Girl From Ipanema"" version w/Stan Getz or ANY of Astrud'sother beautiful Verve songs need to stay away from this low point inher recording career. I don't blame Astrud on this project, and willforgive her. She obviously had bad advice and/or management with this.5 stars for ""Far Away"" and 2 stars for the rest of the material."
5,Fire Pit Ring,"Very pleased with The Gas Fire Pit Ring. I Live in Montana Where the Summer nights can be Quite chilly. I purchased a fire-pit made for wood burning, but converted it to natural gas. The ring was the perfect size and of good construction.To finish the pit off I filled the pit with sand just below the ring then covered the ring with shattered brown safety glass. the gas will find it's way through the glass emitting a nice flame and plenty of heat on those cool summer nights."
3,Watch the Second Half Only,"2 reasons why I would watch Megiddo.1) It's a movie about Revelations - that's cool.2) The battle of Armageddon was nice. Not as intense as battles from Lord of the Rings, We Were Soldiers, etc., but, it was an epic battle scene. What can I say? It's good!The problem with this movie is it runs the middle. The fighting is better in other movies (as listed above) while the plot does not as biblical as movies like Left Behind.One last thing... If you are deciding between this and Omega Code, skip Omega code. It doesn't contribute much to the plot and is not nearly as good.Ultimatly, if you want to see it, I suggest renting the movie, but not buying it."
2,The Total Blasphemy Network's latest project ....,"Fortunately, this movie has little to do with the theologically errant Omega Code I. Unfortunately, it also has little to do with the Bible. While it is entertaining, I would absolutely not show it to an unsaved friend. Despite TBN's claims, it is not a good witnessing tool. Apocalypse/Revelation/Tribulation/Judgement are much better for witnessing."
4,Great Movie!,Megiddo was a great action film. It presented good graphics and battle scenes while staying true to the bible themes it represents. Most of the other reviewers covers the plot and outlook on the movie so I just wanted to second most of their movies. This movie is very good but falls short of being fantastic. I would recommend watching it.Note: This movie does not accurately portray endtimes Bible prophecy.
1,Horrible,This was the worst movie I have ever seen. The special effects matched that of the Scorpian King in The Mummie Returns. I would reccomend not buying this
2,Too much ambition.....,"The ambition surrounding this project is really funny. I think that to shoot a screenplay like this one, there should be at least 200 million dolars available, instead of the low budget this movie got... Let's see why:The plot is about a HUGE war between China / United States / ""THe Latins"" VERSUS EUROPEAN UNION. THis alone would deserve expert special effects.THere's also special effects when Satan appears. There's world wide caos going on.Also, the movie spans a fifty-years period of time...The good point is to see that people still give leading roles to old actors. Michael York (one of the co-producers) is strong some kind of spiritual and political leader. David Hedison surprised me. He's still strong (I was always a fan of VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA). Michael Biehn's career is going downhill since, whatever the reasons, he is not included anymore in James Cameron's projects, but here he tries his best.Anyway, altough a pretentious one, this movie is plain funny."
1,Propaganda for Christian Fundamentalism,"Megiddo doesn't only have one of the worst scripts ever, it also has some poor acting, cheap effects and horrible pompous sound score. But that's not all: If the message ""God kill all bad people"" is what Christianity is all about, I wonder why the New Testament was written. I also wonder, how such a fundamentalistic movie can get a decent review by anybody. It is good to know that there are people who agree with this message, but also more than a little scary."
2,Our baby wont drink it/ smells and tates bad,"We have a baby that has a lot of gas and acid reflux so we tried this out. I was surprised at the smell and taste of it before i even fed it to my baby because it has a pungent smell and a gag inducing taste. Well, i thought maybe it would be different for the baby.... it wasn't. We tried it a couple times and she just wouldn't drink it. We are going to try mixing in a little at a time with the regular formula to see if we can ""work it in"" slowly but initially id say this stuff was too much of a change in taste for our baby to see any results relatively quickly."
3,butter,"Good product, just inconveniently packaged. Given that I live in Texas, shipping something like butter could be a problem, but arrived in good shape. Just not sure it was worth the extra cost of shipping a staple that could be purchased locally."
2,"You can live with it, but....","The most troublesome thing about this TV is the black line and white shading that appears at the top of the monitor whenever there is a dark screen--horror movies, transitions between channels--anytime you watch a dark scene! Sure, in high-def with a bright colorful screen, this TV looks fantastic, but just wait. I've had mine six months, and I sincerely regret spending $700 for it, when I could've gotten the Sony for just a couple hundred more. It's making me insane! Do not purchase this TV if you obsess about the little details like I do!"
3,Body of Evidence,"Audio Book Review - I found the Author to be unnecessarily wordy, with characters and events over discribed. The basis of the plot was good and very intreiging, but unlike other reviewers, I felt the book fell short at the end. The wrap up was just to perfect for a really first rate mystery."
2,Underwhelming,"After so much hype about Patricia Cornwell, I found her book a disappointment. I thought the story was weak, and the writing itself, average. I will not be reading another book of hers."
3,A Line of Murders,"Again Cornwell kept me up at night. This is a fast pace thriller with a body turning-up at every corner. Scarpetta must put a stop to these murders. It started with the murder of an author and the following victims were apart of his past. Cornwell forensic knowledge makes you feel that you are there in her morgue. Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
5,Her best,"Only Rustad's The Triumph and the Glory can match ""Body of Evidence"" for suspense, intrigue, intensity, great characters, and stirring plot. What a great book this is !"
3,same plot trick used about 5 books later!,I just read a recent Scarpatta (Black something) and happened to read this one right afterwards. In both books Scarpatta falls for the same trick: the bad guy comes to the door dressed as someone else and she lets him in! Come on now. Other than that Cornwell did a very nice job on making a readable police procedural.
4,Great mystery,"A well-plotted mystery with well-developed characters. Got me hooked on the entire series, which I'm buying one or two books at a time. Kay Scarpetta is a great character and Cornwell has obviously done her research. Highly recommended."
5,Really liked it!,My 2nd Kay Scapetta novel and loved it. She is a terrific author and never ceases to amaze me. Liked the Key West theme.
3,Calcutta Chromosome Review,"This was a decent book with interesting plot twists. It was very fast paced and kept me interested through the book... until the end.Towards the end of the book, it was as if the author ran out of steam. Many of the plot developments remained underdeveloped and unexplained; I still don't know why some of the stories were included in the book (What was that about the rail station ghost all about anyway?) And the ending was one of the worst I've read in my life, there was no denuement. It simply ended with no feeling of completion.Despite this book's short comings towards the close of the book, I thought it was a good, quick read."
2,A Disappointment,"Having read his exquisitely crafted ""In an Antique Land"" and his almost lyrically beautiful ""Glass Palace"", which struck a special personal chord as I grew up in Burma and India, I couldn't wait to read ""The Calcutta Chromosome"". I found it disappointing, not sure if it was history, a medical who-done-it or what. Amitav Ghose is in my opinion one of the most talented writers alive, but this book which is written with his usual gift of language and expression, left me with an incomplete feeling."
2,I do not understnd the end,"I loved the images the book evoked .I loved reading about the British in India and how they would behave and use euphemisms about the natives its so like how my mother and father would describe their experiences with the English in Malaysia.He writes very well ,he has a delicious sense of humour especially Murugan (call me Morgan) but although I understand the premise the end totally stumped me.I just cannot understand why he would end the book the way he did .I can accept some of the chromosome theory he tried to explain and the extraordinary coincidences with Lutchman and all that but why he chose to end it so weak is why I give it two stars."
3,brilliantly confusing,"i never was able to figure what this book was about. Having never read a book of Mr.Ghosh, I started this book with an open mind.Its a miracle I managed to finish it. I do not know whether I am mentally retarded not to find this book a compelling read, like the many who recommended it. But I do feel that the characters lacked depth, the story lacked logic and the ending was downright sadistic.I mean the way he linked the many characters was splendid, but then the ending was a real let-down. It was asif somebody had torn the last few pages of the novel."
5,motherhood as a spiritual path YES YES YES,This book helped be laugh and learn from the first couple of years at being a new mommy. Excellent read and support for all the emotions and life lessons as well.
1,"Fantastic player, but has one major hitch.","While I found the player itself to be fantastic, there was one major drawback that forced me to give it a one-star rating: it does not actually play mp3 or rm files. Instead it uses two proprietary file formats, mpx and rmj, which can ONLY be written by the included RealJukebox software. The only file format it actually handles straight-through is wma (Windows Media Audio), a proprietary format itself. As I have no facility for creating any of these three formats, and the specification for the executable format of the on-board decoder is not open, I was forced to return this device in favor of another CompactFlash player. If you run Windows exclusively, you might consider the Lyra (or its equally proprietary successor, the Lyra II), but otherwise I would highly recommend another player which can handle standardized formats (such as the Kodak MC3 or the Frontier Nex II)."
3,"Not enjoyable, like pulling teeth","Pam by far has written the best review for this book. I have read as much as I can but can't read much at a time because it is so dry. The way everything is presented in this book was a downer for me. It is written in a way to form your own opinions, but then doesn't give enough detailed and vital information to even do so with a clear vision and interest. It looks like someone just copied and pasted information from many different sources to make a book. I gave 3 stars due to the information on the subject matter IF it is correct. I also wanted to know more about the military operations in Sparta. Above all, it is not worth $25, I would purchase a used one if you're still interested."
4,great toy for quiet time,"We just got this and it is great so far. Perfect quiet toy for the car, the dr,'s office, etc. or just when need to have quiet play time. I didn't buy any additional software and my son likes to freestyle draw and color. Seems to encourage creative play more than handheld video games. Love it!!"
1,Boring Beyond Belief.,"This video begins promising. Two toys set out on an adventure to find out where they come from. However, the show bombs faster than gravity. By the time the toys get to the factory where they were made, no one really cares because the film is so bad no one can stand to watch it anymore. This tape is so bad that the kids at the day care I taught at got so bored with it they all fell asleep (that is a first; television, no matter how bad, has always enthralled kids, as long as it's not too long). This tape is boring beyond belief."
1,This cushion IS NOT THE MEASURMENTS STATED!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!,"So sad that manufacturers now days have to fib about there product to make a sale. It seems to be about that almighty dollar rather than just selling an honestly described product. It is so frustrating to check and then double check and check again to make sure it is the correct one and find out the manufacture is NOT HONEST in the description in the first place. The cushion is a great deal with the one exception. IT IS NOT THE STATED MEASUREMENTS AND WILL NOT FIT. The manufacturer states the product dimensions as: 14 x 8.8 x 2.8 inches. THE TRUE MEASUREMENTS ARE 11.75 x 7 x 1 inches. It is not even close people and it can't be stretched that far. The worst part is, Amazon paired this product with the exercise bike I purchased at the same time. I paid $19.50 for it and now they raised the price to $25.00 I suppose they have to make up for all the returns somehow."
2,"Good, but doesn't fit all seat sizes.","The item seemed of good quality, however, it doesn't fit all bike seats. At least it didn't mine."
3,Description and Packaging Don't Match,"While I can make this capo work, the packaging says it's designed for a classical guitar. Because it's not designed for the electric guitars I'm using it on, placing it requires extra attention. Also, the size and placement of the handles sometimes keeps my fat hands from playing near the capo.Having listed the negatives, let me note that the product seems very well made. It is sturdy and the pads seem both firmly attached, and substantial enough to last a while."
1,Disappointed,I ordered this item over a month ago and have yet to recieve it! I expect to get the items I pay for and am severely disappointed with the lack of help I have recieved.
1,Digital Control Board Failed after 3 1/2 Years,After 3 1/2 years the TV acted crazy. Would turn off automatically after 20 minutes. Later could not turn it off and had to unplug it. Had a Repairman run diagnostics. Main control board failed. Cost $400 to repair. Last Phillips TV I will buy.
5,A great lost classic,"Iron Butterfly has been dismissed by many, if not all contemparary reviewers. I think they are dead wrong. The band was inovative and unique. But of all their work this album belongs in every serious listeners collection. This is an extraordinarily fine disc. This disc has it all: wonderful lyrics, great hooks and melodies, and the musicianship is of the very highest caliber. It sounds like nothing else the band ever did. For those of you who enjoyed Captain Beyond, this album is the jumping off point for that effort. I have listened to this disc for 25 years and it is just as fresh and exciting each time I reach for it. Do yourself a huge favor and buy this disc."
1,Illustrated? If that's what you want to call it....,"First of all, I must say that Leroux's original novel is a bit of an obsession with me, so whenever I find another edition, illustrated or otherwise, I buy it. It's my ""Catcher in the Rye"" as it were...so when I found this ""illustrated"" edition...I jumped on it and bought it. I was truly disappointed with the pictures...I've seen better art from Jr. High students. Who would put such garbage in their book? Not only were the pictures poor...so was the ""abridged"" text. If you want a ""simplified"" version to read...read Lowell Bair's adapted version.Poor take on The Phantom of the Opera...and only a good copy to put in one's ""Phantom of the Opera Library"" should you be a hardcore fan that must have every edition published (as I do)."
4,A good product,"Even though this came with no directions as to how to put it together, it was easy to figure out. It has a good height for a large greyhound and has ample storage but I would keep the food in an air tight container within the feeder. The bowls are certainly a nice size. It filled the need for what I was looking for."
5,A Literary Masterpiece!,"This book is, unquestionably, a piece of literary gold. When people mention great writers, one usually hears the names of Hemingway, Faulkner, and Kafka, but now the name ""Collins"" HAS to be added to the list. With her lucid prose and poignant characterization, Collins enters the realm of legendary status. A masterpiece!"
4,Treashy and entertaining story of Hollywood once you get to know the many characters,"Hollywood Wives follows a big cast of characters in Hollywood, and not only wives, but husbands, talent agents, male hustlers, would-be actors, moviestars and ex-moviestars, directors, producers, screenwriters and talent agents. Most of them are presented early in the book, making it a bit hard to keep track of them but after a while I got them sorted out and found myself more and more involved in their intigues. ""Hollywood Wives"" is fun, trashy and entertaining. There are some far fetched episodes but on the whole the story is well constructed and certainly entertaining. Recommended, espcially for thos who like reading novels set in Hollywood and don't mind lots of sex in their books."
4,True Jackie Collins Book,"This book was a good read, enjoyed it. Have read most of Jackie Collins' books and all are enjoyable. Romance, Sex, and Mystery makes for a good read."
4,Textile Dyeing,a great reference book covering many aspects of dyeing. Gives plenty of detail and recipes.
4,Nice grouping of old favorites,"This DVD features 2 of my daughters' favorite stories - Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny - along with a story about another adventure when they had grown up and had little bunnies. A very nice grouping, and we really enjoyed it. I am glad it is out on DVD - my videos were getting worn out by the 4th kid!"
4,Engaging and Fun,"Our 4-year-old received this for Christmas from Grandma. She quickly figured out the pages for each letter correspond to the short songs on the tape. Each side of the tape has the same content - the traditional alphabet song, little songs for each of the letters (featuring an animal, a name, and a musical instrument), then the alphabet song again. It's a nice little educational entertainment for the car."
4,A Godly Woman,A very interesting book. My ladies minstry group is reading it in study group this term.The ladies and I are covering a lot of material from this book.
5,love it,perfect in ever way. perfect colors for my kitchen. perfect naustical thime for my house. i love natical themed stuff
5,coffrr,"We love Yuban ground decaf coffee,but can't find it in any stores where we live Amazon saved the day. There service is excelent and delivery is very good."
5,Disney at its best,"I still like this film after all these years, yes its escapist and not at all believable but that's what makes it fun. I still want to go live in the that tree house. Solid cast that does a great job making this whole film come alive. Sorry to all of the people under 30 but this is way better than all of the animated stuff that has come out in the last 20 years."
3,Swiss Family Robinson - Wide Screen,"This DVD was a big disappointment. It is in widescreen and the color and clarity are just not as good as a VHS copy I own. DVD's are far superior to VHS normally, but I'm just not happy with this particular DVD."
1,Extremely Unhappy,"I purchased this DVD for my daughter for Christmas. Had no clue as to what region 2 meant. Assumed it had to do with the warehouse location or something else unimportant to the consumer. When my daughter tried to play it after Christmas it wouldn't play. Found out that region 2 means it can only be played in Great Britain. Why the heck would you sell a DVD to a U.S. customer in the Mid-West if it couldn't be played? I simply searched for the movie by title, had 4 or 5 choices of places to purchase it from and picked the one that I had already made other purchases from. That's the real kicker. I purchased 3 DVD's, ON THE SAME ORDER, from this place. Didn't it seem strange that I would want to play one of them way over in Europe???"
4,oldie but goodie,I remember the original show and the TV series as well. I watched them religiously on Disney on Sunday night with my family.
4,surprise hit with whole family,"Though it might strike some as corny, our kids, aged 5, 10, and 12 all loved it. The treehouse, the wild animals tamed instantly into pets, the thrill of fighting pirates - something for everyone. The storyline is pretty silly, and the pirates ridiculous, but we all got a kick out of it. The 5 and 10 year olds watched it three times. If your kids like the outdoors, and don't mind a little retro fun, try this one."
4,Good Family Movie,It's a classic... can't go wrong if you are looking for a safe family film for kids under 10 years of age.
5,A Classic...,"This film was made back in the day when Disney knew how to make a live action film. Nowadays they just make that teeny-pop junk that only little 8 yr old girls go to see. But anyway, this film, ""Swiss Family Robinson"" was one of my most favorite films when I was growing up. Man, did I want to be on that island with them. Diving off waterfalls, capturing wild tigers and ofcourse, battling scirvy pirates with the aid of coconut bombs. If that ain't livin, I don't know what is. If you're like me and love the old tales of adventure like ""Treasure Island"", then this movie is a must buy. Speaking of ""Treasure Island"", Disney also did a great adaption of this story aswell, which I recommend highly. You might also want to look up a film Disney did called ""Ship Wrecked"", which was only made a little more than ten years ago I think, but is of the same calibur as ""Swiss Family Robinson"". Enjoy!"
5,A sublime account of a spiritual search,"The Writing on the Water is a sublime account of the simplicity, honesty, humility, faith and focus deployed by a man on his search to spiritual truth and wisdom. Shakoor writes in a simple and genuine style, with no attempt at convincing us that he got it right and that we should all do as he did. He simply did what he felt was right for him to do, and for me, that was the essential message. The book left me with a deep and lasting sense of humility and joy."
4,Some hilarious parts,"In general this is a low budget movie and it shows. However, there are some pretty hilarious scenes--one is the exchange between Ralph's mother-in-law and the diner owner--which make the movie well worth seeing."
3,Nice but hard to keep clean,this is a nice product and feel great against the skin. I do have a problem with keeping it straight on the comforter and keeping it clean it gets dirty very easily which is kind of annoying.
3,Decent if not complete collection,"Though somewhat more popular in the U.K., three of Smokie's singles made the top-100 stateside. This 18-track compilation out of U.K. BMG's Camden imprint gathers up most of the group's U.K. and U.S. charting tunes along with other singles and album tracks. Missing is the first U.S. charting single, ""If You Think You Know How To Love Me"" as by Smokey and this omission, most likely due to licensing considerations, makes this piece a less than comprehensive overview of the group leaving it less deserving of a higher star rating. Sound quality is decent and the insert has a track listing with a brief one-page overview of the group's musical output. Overall, this is a reasonably priced, decent no-frills overview of this late-70's British pop group."
1,Glosses over reality,"In his noble effort to encourage peace, the author has written an indictment of US policies, while glossing over the realities of the present world order. He presents Islam in an irenic way, ignoring the fact that the Islamic resurgence is fomenting violence all over the world. This book is a one-sided view, based more on rhetoric than reality. Don't waste your money on it."
5,Stylistically Perfect,"We purchased many lighting fixtures from the Kenroy Home Plateau family. We have a 4-Square/Craftsman home, and these lighting fixtures are modern yet fit our Craftsman-style home perfectly. They are very Frank Lloyd Wright-esque. We have two pendants over our kitchen island and another pendant over our kitchen sink. We have the 4-light chandelier, 2 floor lamps, 1 table lamp, and 3 ceiling fixtures. They are substantial and 'rich' looking, and we love them all!"
3,Good book to have in my collection,"I think I will get some good pointers as I try some of the techniques in the book. I was disappointed in the size, thought it would be a larger format."
2,not much to it,"This serves the purpose, but there isn't a lot to it for the price. There is no hole for the volume control. But it is as advertised and received it very, very quickly."
3,Belt Clip Not So Great,"I have no problem with the skin or the arm band, but the belt clip was too big and loose. First it wasn't included in my package, then when it did come, it was white and didn't match the skin. I like the swivel function of the clip, but it tends to move around the waist band of my workout pants. And it bounces when you run. To the point where I had to take my mp3 out of the clip and hold it while wearing a particular pair of pants. I've taken to sticking it in the tie of my shorts to keep it from moving."
3,Broke 2 weeks after we got it.,I really liked the idea of this but the button that holds the clip in place broke after I used it about 3 times. Very disappointed!
1,What a major disappointment.,"I consider myself a new ""fan,"" of No Warning, having accidentally received their Ill Blood album from their old label, Bridge 9. Ill Blood was wicked. This, however, is completely disappointing. The change in label tells the tale: they went from all-hardcore Bridge 9 to the Linkin-Park-and-God-knows-what-else Machine Shop label. If you're a fan of Linkin Park or Sum 41, you may enjoy this, because it definitely incorporates elements from their music. More power to you. However, if you come from the Old School Hardcore school, like I do, and were really turned on by their previous albums, you'll see this one as a travesty. The worst part is that the songs are almost good, but then they break into a really lame melodic radio-friendly sound right where you think they're gonna let loose like they did in the previous albums. In short, if you were a fan of the Ill Blood or the S/T, avoid this album."
5,Delightful accounts of the earliest disease descriptions.,"This collection of the earliest descriptions of common diseases provides wonderful insights into how early physicians dealt with diseases which, in most cases, they were incapable of treating. The descriptions pay tribute to the observational skills of the earliest physicians, who had little to offer their patients other than a prognosis based on keen diagnostic skills and careful observation. The introduction by Major to each description provides the setting for understanding the period in which each physician wrote. You do not have to be interested in history to appreciate the perspective this work gives on modern medical practice. This would be a particularly good gift for the student beginning medical school. It was given to me on that occasion 30 years ago and I still enjoy reading the descriptions."
2,Hard to sit on,"I wouldn't recommend this swivel to anyone for use in a car. It is small, hard and sinks in to the car seat, preventing it from swiveling much. Once on it, I felt great discomfort. ( I was recovering from a broken pelvis.) A folded towel worked better, and a friend recommended a plastic shopping bag that you get free with purchases. These work better."
4,Inspired Fingerstyle Guitar Renditions of Beatles Songs,"As a former member of Paul McCartney's latter-day Wings (he appeared on Back to the Egg in 1978), it is only natural that the classically trained Laurence Juber would eventually record a collection of Beatles songs.Juber covers songs from all of the Beatles except Ringo--""Octopuses Garden"" would have been a nice addition. With most of these songs, Juber uses altered tunings. Overall, these fourteen acoustic solos, showcase his formidable fingerstyle guitar skills.I first heard Juber as a solo artist last year when I picked up a cutout copy of his second album Naked Guitar and was stunned by the beauty of his playing. When I saw this loving musical and artistic tribute to the Beatles (Baby Boomers will recognize the cover), I knew this had to be my second purchase. I wasn't disappointed! RECOMMENDED"
4,What an improvement over a plain stainless steel bottle!,"I am shocked at how well this insulates my water bottle. Depending on how much I carry it around at work, I can keep ice in the bottle for 7 hours. The stitching worries me as well as the snap that people talk about but I'm super careful and don't use the snap and haven't had any problems with the tote yet. I'd recommend this to friends just for the fact of the great insulation properties and because you no longer leave water marks everywhere you go. I'd buy this again!"
1,received wrong book,I was going to use the book last week but then I realized that I had gotten a totally different book than the one I ordered. I didn't realize it when I received it in the mail I guess.
5,Sherlock Holmes,I always enjoy a good Sherlock Holmes movie. Basil Rathbone is a classic Sherlock Holmes. He is my favorite next to Ronald Howard in the short series of Sherlock Holmes TV movies made. Always a must watch.
2,"Nice map, but waaayyy too high level","This map looks nice, but if you're going hiking, you'll be better off with the free park maps given at the park. It's just way too high level, with 100-foot contours, and very little detail. It's also not waterproof or resistant."
2,A Downer,"Don't expect that your audience will have a good time with this one. It will take first class direction to make it tolerable. It is a 1937 play based on circumstances that still held horrifying remembrances of World War I. It is anti war extreme emphasising the dreadful results of war: the young men whose lives were cut short and the loss felt by their loved ones. It is loaded with carictures of generals, priests and right wing media illustrative of the playwrite's liberal and unknowledgeable view of the military."
4,wonderful music,this romeo and juliet production was wonderful. as the audience will applaud their approval of the singers and music. and the music...gounod's music is quite lovely throughout. at times the soprano was barely audible but did not distract from the role. roberto alagna is very good here. i come to appreciate him more and more....tom hammond
1,romeo et juliette,At chapter 19 the DVD stopped and would not continue. If this had been purchased at a local store it could have just been taken for a replacement. At present I am stuck with it.
2,Not original enough,"I practice Earth Spirituality but Ms. Sams' writting left me confused over how to relate to nature. For me, this book was frankly too New Agey for my tastes. Many of the writings seemed to be a rehashing of New Age Indianisms. I prefer a more original approach to Earth Spirituality than simply ""Indianisms""."
5,A satisfying read,"A compelling and well-written story of an awkward adolescent girl, Natalie Irving, who discovers that she possesses the power to turn invisible at will, just like her famous and highly controversial mother Jadyn. Her sympathetic and loyal bodyguard, Peter Maraszek, provides the only stability in her life, as she is almost immediately forced to make difficult decisions on how to use her new found superpowers.This story is as much about how Natalie comes to grips with her conflicted feelings about her parents as it is a fast-paced and clever superhero story, with many unexpected twists along the way. Altogether, a satisfying read."
4,theological aesthetics,This is an excellent resource for those who care about the visual arts and communities of faith. Somewhat intellectually advanced but well worth the effort.
5,perfect,just what i needed and shipped out very fast and packaged very good. would recommend to everyone Merry Christmas everyone
5,Perfect resource to win the war against cancer!!!!,"Awesome book!!Very complete, simple to follow, and thorough...a perfect resource for anyone struggling with cancer and overwhelmed by how and where to get the right information to win this battle in a healthy,easy to follow,non-toxic, and cost-effective manner.The part about prayer and healing is very important.Trusting in a Power greater than yourself to win this battle for you is very EMPOWERING because unlike us,God has no limitations.Using these methods my breast cancer was cured w/o chemotherapy or radiation."
2,Scaience and spirit-the great questions,He told us what was wrong with current belief-what is the replacement and where is the scientific backing for his view?
2,Didn't care much for this super fast pace Bossa Nova.....,"I love Brazilian music but this CD didn't do the trick, the music is super fast, if you are like me looking for that groovy Brazilian music that makes you so happy from the inside out? Then this CD is not for you."
3,MIXED CHERRIES,"This CD was released after the European success of MAN, an album that never was released in the states. At 7 tracks, there is only a few worth hearing. La Funk MOB does a remix of WOMAN, that is spectatcular. There are 2 remixes of FEEL IT, and the DOCTOR L B remix is the standout. Also witness AIR remix KOOTCHIE. A good spin, but the other tracks are made for trendy background music for cafe's. This would be the last official NENEH CHERRY CD as she dove into collaborations with AKASHA, DREEM TEAM, and contributed songs on various soundtracks. Neneh has also popped up on the recen 1 Giant Leap CD and guested on Eagle EYE CHERRY's latest."
5,interesting,a true story of jack and the beanstalk. goes back to about 600 years at least. one thing about the movie is the beanstalk world ages a lot slower. a few minutes up in the giant world is like 7 years down hear. see when i say in the giant world you know in the storys the beanstalks leads to another world.
5,Not Just for Kids,"I thought it would be a good tape for the kids but I was surprised. It was interesting and captivating. However, I did not see how long the movie was before I bought it. The quality of the picture on VHS (due to it being over 3 hours long) was less than pleasing. I will now check all tapes for length and if they are much over 2 hours long, I will get them in DVD only.I liked the movie enough that I am going to purchase it again . . . in DVD."
4,A cool twist on an old tale,"This movie has been a favorite of my family since it first aired. I love how they tie in financial responsibility and an old fairy tale. The twist making the giant the good guy was and showing Jack for the theif he always was is great. I love Vanessa Redgrave's part; her ability to show dignity on screen was clear. Jon Voight's comedic side was also apparent in his role.That said, the plot is very slow, particularly in the beginning. I also think the ending was a bit abrupt. Personally, I would have liked to see more of the giants world. Overall, though, I would definitly recommend this to families with kids over 8 (younger children may not have the attention span needed for the slow plot)."
5,Excellent,This movie was excellent. My husband and I watched it twice. I highly recommend it for adults as well as children. The storyline was excellent as well as the choreography.
4,Perfect drumsticks for a toddler,"My son is in love with drums! His dad is a drummer and he's always wanting to use daddy's set, but the sticks are just too big for his 2 1/2 year old hands. I found these and they are big and light enough for him to handle successfully. I wish that they looked more like an adult stick,(not blue, but natural wood)...overall they have served its purpose."
4,Nice but bad managing from Amazon,"It's an awsome sounding product, believe me. I wish to by it but for some stupid reason they won't ship it to me internationally."
2,A Disappointment- but Fess Parker was Good,"After seeing Davy Crockett King of the Wild Frontier ( when I was only 12 or 13), I thought that it would be nice to see the second feature film that Fess Parker was in as Davy Crockett. But, I was extremely disappointed, especially that the script was very poorly done, more like a cheap western from TV than the quality film that it could have been. The scenery was beautiful, Fess Parker was excellent in his role, as he always was, but everything else was not up to par. Actually, if I could have rated the film as one and a half stars I would have done it ... two stars is too high."
2,Forestlover,I have loved all of the books by this author but this one is slow and hard to read. I love Emily Carr's unusual art and history and will finish this book but the experience had been painful.
2,Misleading,"When you look at the front cover of the DVD, you might think you were buying a detailed and picturesque description of the inside passage, but you'd be wrong. Ditto on the comments about this DVD belonging in a museum. It was often boring and didn't describe any of the cities or towns along the inside passage. A total waste of money."
4,The Title Speaks For Itself!,It Just Gets Better With Time is like a premonition for the writing career of Maseyree Lofton!The charaterization of these two sisters and the struggles of their life was very well done. As first novels go Ms. Lofton did the job and then some!I thoroughly enjoyed this story as it was different from the urban novels and romances I'd read recently and I can't wait for the next offering from this talented writer.
3,"Clever, complex and a fun read","It's a clever story, although the first few chapters are somewhat slow (especially after such a powerful prologue). It does pick up nicely around the fifth chapter and then it seems to morph into a very complex story, with a huge twist, in the middle of the book. From that point on I really enjoyed the book and it really became a page-turner. I did not like the ending; a more clear cut conclusion would have helped answer some lingering questions."
4,Great story -- certain to rival The Da Vinci Code,"Nash, the lead character, is clever but also gullible, brave yet frail, passionate but sometimes cold---seemingly real traits of someone who stumbles into the espionage profession---and that reality is what makes this story interesting. At times the plot becomes quite complex, particularly in the middle, and a couple of chapters are too long, but the characters and the dramatic twists in the book make this a true page-turner."
2,I didn't finish this,"I fell asleep so it tells me it was not very interesting or compelling. Or maybe I was just too tired, but I will not be renting it again to find out what happened."
2,Mediocre.,Kim Hyesu's acting is a little over dramatic as usual. The story is improbable. It is not horribly boring but I had to fast forward frequently.
3,Author! Ending Needed!,"For the first four-fifths of this movie, it was one of the creepiest, scariest films I've ever seen. A souffle of understated horror, acted to perfection by Bob Hoskins and Elaine Cassidy. But then, plop, the souffle falls in. The screenwriter simply could not think of a way to end the film. He set it up for the first four-fifths, and then, cliches upon cliches. Doesn't any director read the entire script before starting the filming? Or do they just read up to 80% and then want to be surprised by whatever ending the actors come up with? Why do I give this film as many as three stars? Because it was so well done, for a while. Not even a drop of blood. No corpses. No maiming. It delivers the horror by the sheer cinematography and understatement. Bottom line: strictly for moviegoers who want to see good horror-film-making technique, but stay away if you don't like to be disappointed by the plot."
4,Learning Critters is Fun,"We purchased this DVD along with others to make learning about ""critters"" in their habitat fun and enjoyable for children. Thanks Amazon!"
4,Where's the Five Part Harmony in Alt-Rock?,"Possibly the most complicated music ever recorded by a band saddled with the descriptor rock, Gentle Giant grabs the madrigal format of the 13th century vocal music, and adds a mix of xylophones, trumpets, krumhorns, and electric guitars. This is one of their two great works(the other is Freehand) and features a vast assortment of prog anthems (if such a thing is possible) many more acceptable than others. If you think prog rock must always be about topographical oceans, examine this medieval masterpiece."
2,Visual Puns,"I haven't seen this book since I was a kid, but I remember that it is basically a collection of visual puns using cartoon cats, one per page. For instance, one page was titled ""Caterpillar"" (or some variation) and showed something that looked like a caterpillar with a cat's head. If I remember correctly, it was in French and English, but it was all so obvious that knowing French wasn't necessary. Probably not a book worth buying for the content."
5,Very Impressive!,"I have yet to see a DVD that is this extensive. The matches are well taped, and the sound is amazing! I really enjoyed watching the special features which is something that you never see with badminton videos."
5,Great Easter Sunday activity.,Great for use in Sunday School setting. I used it for my Sunday school class. They loved opening the eggs.
4,"Did the trick, but probably could have made this if I had the gumption","The sellers sent it quickly; I bought it used at amazon marketplace and it did smell like it came from a home with smokers. It's fading, and we will survive, but that was a bit off putting at first.That being said, the eggs were in great shape, and each little token or symbol was a great tangible learning tool as we talked to our kids age 5, 3, 18 and 10 mos about Easter. We also used Benjami'ns Box book to help tell the tale and that worked great.One of our eggs cracked, but all plastic easter eggs do when kids play rough. Won't be hard to replace for next year. Just grateful despite my tardy ordering it got here before Easter.If you have any desire to save money, you could buy the book Benjamin's Box and make your own eggs. You just have to pick something to put in them. Will def use these again next year."
2,cheap material,"these are made of like a rough lace material, too scratchy probably wont even wear them... shipping was fine fast enough. will try washing see if that helps but doubt it"
4,useful but a bit oudated,"After reading the book, I found a clearer picture about mass customization. Mass customization is now widely used by many businesses, but we may not know how it operates!In this book, it tells you how you should change your business operation to mass customization step by step, also tell you 5 methods to customize your products or services. And these 5 methods are useful and practicable for designing how the business enter the market.The stucture of the book is clear, give a full description on the development of the operation, from mass production to mass customization , and the pros and cons of those two operations, followed with the detail explanation on mass customization.However, I think it's a bit outdated because all the things around us are mass customized and we do not have to decide whether we should change to customized operation or not, but to decide the degree of the customization."
3,"Cute, but lacking...","This is a rather amusing take on Merlin - Rik Mayall plays an affable but rather bumbling Merlin, who lives in modern-day England - and has to awaken a Hibernating Arthur and company to battle Mordred, who is trying to break free from a magical prison. The flick is produced well enough, but in watching it, I get the feeling that it's culled together from selected clips from a TV series or some such - end result being that I feel like I've witnessed an 'insider joke' - it's amusing overall, but you just don't have the whole story. I'm also taking away a star for the producers not being able to find anything for Adrian Paul to do, other that the expected gratuitous swordfight or two. Points off for Typecasting. All in all though, there's worse ways to drop ten bucks..."
2,Do not waste your money,"""Colombia Map,"" by Itco Itmb and the International Travel Maps & Books of Vancouver, Canada is a detailed and concise publication that defines the contoured boundaries of a major Andean nation. Moreover, it provides exact descriptions of critical regions and major cities. Nevertheless, there are many other commercial text's available on Amazon that do a much better job of exploring Colombia and documenting critical travel information.To this end, ""The Colombia Map,"" is culturally hollow and offers limited valuable insights to travelers on how one negotiates the streets of a nation in the middle of a bloody civil war. If the purpose of this online purchase is a quick guide from the comfort of your home... to identify an area reported on the evening news...go ahead and buy it. But if you plan a trip to Colombia and are relying on this publication to get around...go elsewhere for guidance."
1,"Rusted, bent handles, poor quality","The product was of poor quality, rusted on parts, and bent at the handles. For so cheap I should have suspected as much, but was maybe a little delusional in thinking I might get a decent pair of hemostats for so cheap. Not using them for surgery of course, but at the very least hoped for the appearance of ""newness"", which these lacked. Customer service seems fine with this seller, nothing wrong there, but the product is in no way similar to the picture on the site. If you're looking for decent hemostats these are not the ticket, however if you just need some cheap little clamps for whatever you're working on these will probably do the trick."
5,Being as this is SUBLIME if find it GREAT!,"I always play this CD to lift my spirits knowing Brad loved his music and KNowing that NO ONE can ever come to close of what Brad has done for the world. Remember and Listen to the lyrics and accept the fact that they are the same songs but the more you hear the more and more You love this band. SUBLIME is really great and Brad is loving every minute of watching us all enjoy his music. Acoustic is more then just another addition to my collection......more like my own wave link to understand Brad and his pain and his love for all types of music. This CD IS really GREAT.......YOU WILL ENJOY if you are a SUBLIME Fanatic like me. Listening to this CD will Help you understand Brad and make you love him,Bud,and Eric and their Music and their way of enjoying life and overcomming life."
3,"Not awful, but not that great either.","This is my 3rd booklight now... and I will be soon buying my fourth.My criteria for a booklight are that it needs to illuminate the crossword page in the newspaper, and doesn't disturb my wife when she's trying to sleep.This light works fine when the batteries are new, and it's very bright. I've found that it does drain batteries (non-rechargeables) very quickly however (after just a few hours of use), and the light flickers becomes increasingly dim. The light also flickers a lot when you move it around or adjust the arm. Also the design of the light fixture means that it produces a lot of ambient light (disturbing aforementioned wife). It would be better with one side shaded."
4,Pfaltzgraff Tea Rose,"These dishes are very pretty and durable. My only complaint is that they show little gray ""wear marks"" when you cut your food. Some come off in the dishwasher or with scrubbing, but some don't."
3,Unfinished Bracelet,"At first view looks impressive however once you try to wear it, the bad finished on the back of the bracelet becomes a nightmare for your wrist's hair.I really did not expected this kind of problem coming from a Swiss Army product."
2,Not The Best Choice,"High points of this book include good safety notes, some basic charts and tips on easily peeling various fruits tucked throughout the pages. I was also pleased to see that it contained two canned soup recipes. On the other hand, the recipes were primarily chutneys, jams and other items that were neither unqiue nor particularly varied. I was extremely disappointed with the inclusion of modified food starch in the apple pie filling - isn't avoiding modified or unnatural ingredients one of the great motivations for canning to begin with? Regardless of your level of canning experience or what you're looking to put up, I suggest you skip this book and try one of the much better options available (Putting Food By or Ashley English's Canning & Preserving being excellent alternatives).Definitely on the short side, as well."
4,Better Homes and Garden Presents: America's All Time Favorite Canning & Preserving Recipes,The book itself was packeged well and as described. Only problem ~ wasn't shipped until one week after the purchase date.
1,Not as Pictured,"Not as pictured...how hard is it to put up an accurate photo?I bought this because it was shaped like the supplied iPhone plug which fits the case I currently have.Unfortunately, the supplied plug is rectangular and will not fit!"
5,GREAT MOVIE,"I absolutely love this movie, I had my mouth open through out the movie womdering what was gonna happen next. This movie reminded me alot of 28 days later and 28 weeks later. The UNRATED version is gorey for all your gore fans out there this movie will not dissapoint. Caught me off guard, the acting was ""GREAT"" no complaints, the director was ""AWESOME"" A+ is a keeper. ENJOY! ENJOY! ENJOY!"
3,"Not bad for what it is, and it is what it is","The title says it all. Flight of the Living Dead: Outbreak on a Plane is exactly what it says: a glorified D-horror movie that should have basically been called Zombies on a Plane. Surprisingly though, Flight of the Living Dead isn't all that bad, and in spots it's actually kind of enjoyable to boot. There isn't a whole lot in terms of plot to be found here (like I said, the title says it all and tells you everything you really need to know), but there's enough bloody fun to be had here. The blood and gore effects are decent enough for a low budget, direct to DVD horror flick, and there's some familiar faces to be found here including Pet Semetery's Dale Midkiff and The Mummy's Kevin J. O'Connor. It's campy and kind of goofy, and if you're reading this, chances are you already know what you're getting with Flight of the Living Dead. As an afterthought, maybe New Line should have released this theatrically instead of Snakes on a Plane."
4,A to Z-ombie review,"A-irplane flying to ParisB-oneable stewardesses provide serviceC-argo below is highly unstableD-eath is not always permanentE-xperimenting with human life is funF-ormulating the setup for the slaughterG-ore, gore, I'm waiting?H-o-hum, Mackshere's getting boredI-t's on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!J-eez look at the bloody human devourageK-illing gets creative and plentifulL-ove the gore, of courseM-an, this is great!N-o place to run for safetyO-verwhelmed by the madnessP-ilots just got devouredQ-uestions grim about survivalR-ampant fear & desperationS-tarting to use CGIT-his is getting a tad ridiculuosU-tter retardationV-icious is no longer deliciousW-TF?X-tremely silly conclusionY-ou probably saw that comingZ-ombies still rule!!!!!!!!!!!!!FINAL GRADE----B-etter than expected 3.5 stars"
3,Not totally worthless.,"You may see this and feel it's a 2 star at best, but 2 stars to me is saying that it was not enjoyable on any level. 1 star would mean wanting to assault all those involved like i feel about night of the living dead in 3d. I found this to be somewhat entertaining. It had some good moments and some good makeup & effects, very acceptable acting and only a few moments that would make you think ""Why would they put that stupid $#!+ in there. If you love Zombie movies, you'll like this one. If you like Zombie movies, you still probably will not regret the time spent watching this one. If you don't like Zombies period, go check out Snakes on a plane. It's the same movie, only with snakes."
4,Over the top and beyond!,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw this film. It started out somewhat slowly, but within 25 minutes the action began, and then did not stop til an hour later. This film is so far over the top, and unbelievable that you'll have to apologize to your brain if you were expecting a George Romero film. However, this film is good, and fun to watch. The special effects are quite good and the action is fast paced. all in all, not a bad little film... It is worth adding to your zombie collection..."
5,Old fashioned fun!,John Wayne and Dean Martin together after Rio Bravo- Great old stars with good entertainment... they way Hollywood used to make films.
3,"good plot, bad lead?","John Wayne was old and fat and walked like a duck in this movie.There was just a bare romantic thread with Martha Hyer.As a western it is pretty well done, but there are some real faults.I'm a big John Wayne fan and this is not his finest hour.I think that the story is the best part of thisas the acting wasn't all that convincing to me.I like the movie anyway."
2,Not one of Duke's best!,"This western has its moments - but there is a fatal mistake in the final shoot-out: John Wayne actually manages to fire 16 or 17 shots (just count them)with his six-shooter without having any second in the movie to re-load. Hathaway should have caught that! It is also unlikely that Wayne - who is nearly 60 - could be big-brother to Michael Anderson,Jr. - who is about 18 years old in the movie. If you watch closely, there are other mistakes. The director must have been tired. The movie could have been much better!"
1,I don't think we saw the same movie!,The other reviewer MUST be referring to something else. Master with cracked fingers is wretched.
1,Do Not Buy This Software. Corporate Policy Unfair.,"I bought Rosetta Stone Japanese and Spanish (Latin America) in the last couple of years. I found them (particularly Japanese) a bit difficult. Last week in an airport, a Rosetta representative said I needed the new version - it is very much better. I called Rosetta Stone and they offered me a price of $399, $100 off of $499. This is a pretty harsh upgrade route and left me disappointed. I am not the US Government or an institution, just an individual trying to better myself and this is way too expensive. I can return original disks for the upgrade. They have not quite worn out. Perhaps an updgrade with a media fee of say $25 would be fair. Their policy is not a fair policy and I cannot recommend anyone do business with Rosetta Stone."
2,YOU NEED TO KNOW THIS,"You cannot legally sell this software when you are done with it. They threatened to sue me when I did - they said I had not bought the software, but a license for the software and it was nontransferrable - that I did not have the right to even GIVE it away."
5,I Couldn't walk away until it was over.,"Great silent film! I was up late one night flipping through channels until I came upon this one. After only a few minutes, I was captivated and hanging on to see what would happen next. Action, history, romance, comedy, this has it all and of course an emotional and happy ending."
2,Better purchase individual phrasebooks,You are better off buying multiple phrasebooks for all the countries you plan to visit. Does not contain enough useful phrases for any of the included countries.
1,"If I could give this movie 1/2 a star, I would.","I think Lauren Velez is a great actress. However, I really do believe this movie was neither comical nor realistic. This movie gives Puerto Ricans, especially Neuyoricans a real bad look. To all those who actually liked this movie, I'm not too suprised. Your bought into what Hollywood thinks of Latinos, and you really don't mind if this stereotype continues. Maybe if the director knew a little bit about Puerto Ricans, he might had put some effort into making the Puerto Rican characters real enough to believe. As a Neuyorican with dignity and respect for myself, my family, my community, and my ancestors I give this movie an F.To the director, and producers, ""Put your money to use, pick up a book about hard working, educated Puerto Ricans. You might learn something."""
5,My dog loves these balls!,"I have a lab who loves these balls. She will retrieve most anything, but always has one of these in her mouth ready to play ball. They are well-constructed for what they are... a plush toy. They will endure labrador abuse for a couple of months before needing repair."
1,Very strong smell,"I expected a better smell from Cartier , I used santos de Cartier in the past and it was much nicer and better smell"
1,received wrong flavor,I am so disappointed. I ordered Hazalnut flavor and received another flavor. I have no way of reaching anyone. I feel I have been ripped off. I need help. someone please help me. My money is gone. who can I blame?
1,Totally lacking any substance,"After reading the first three books in this series i felt it was only right to embark on the final installment. Boy...what a disappointment! I struggled endlessly to finish it. It totally lacked substance and had no backbone..nor did its characters, especially Summer. Talk about a spoiled child!!!! And the part with Suze and Ed was just enough to make me want to stop and not finsh the book. I surely hope I'll find what I'm looking for in the ""Willow"" series. There is something to be said about ghostwriters...and Ms. Andrews' ghostwriter needs to wake up and smell the coffee!"
2,Recommnded for little kids,"This really stupid if you like the original VCA books. I, for one, think the ghostwriter needs new material and better characters. Those who say Summer is a ""strong"" character need to read the Heaven series and FITA. Then see if she's stong. Oh, she was so deprived from good upbringing!! Her Mommy and Daddy tortured their little Princess when they gave her gifts and hugs and kisses. Such a horror story. I expected to find this in the children's section of the bookstore after reading it. Poor VCA, she must be so embarrased to have such kiddie stories written under her name!I'm sorry, but Summer was a weakling. Why would she go out to the guy's car to, um, talk. Yeah, right. She odvously doesn't know much about guys.So this book is good if you like children's books, the eleven-years-olds seem to like it... but if your a real VCA fan... it just a sad disappointment.Hopefully Willow will be better."
1,Thank the Gods that this is the last one!!,"The Hudson series was nothing more then a rewrite of the Cutler Series. So if you want to know about the Hudson series, just read the Cutler series over again! THe GW just copied it all over again and only made very, very few changes. What could have been a groundbraking saga turned into a damp mess.The GW has offically made up my mind NOT to buy anymore VCA novels."
4,The End of The Rainbow,"I enjoy VCA and look foreward to new releases, This book was okay. I felt let down when I finished this book. It did not seem to have the drama that most of VCA has. I think it is time to find a new ghost to write, Someone whom can deliver in a true VC Andrews way..........."
2,Cable,"Not impress. Looks cheap. The cables look skinny. Expected more since this is Monster THX.Not a great buy, have put it to my unwanted toys storage"
1,8 Mixs! now only if they were good..,"I waiting to buy the us version of this single [instead of importing the uk one] because there would be more mixs. Too bad most of the mixs are terrible.They try to take the song and make it more upbeat but fail. The full song isn't on this cd [the orginal is 10 mins long , you can get it on the Movement in still life import +9 ] Pass on this cd. The only good point form the cd is the album version even though it is short."
3,"gritty story, but what about that ending?!?","David Goodis is the champion of the down-and-outs, druggies, boozers and misfits. In 'The Moon in the Gutter' we have an interesting story about a stevedore (dock worker) and his utterly miserable existence. He has difficulty in coming to grips with the grisly death of his sister, his home life is a disaster, and his future looks bleak. But then he meets a blonde from the other side of the tracks and ....While I won't give any spoilers here let me just say I felt very let down by the ending of this novel. David Goodis brings the reader into the life of this poor soul and shows us his world without compassion. Towards the end the tension builds (..again no spoilers) but the author fails miserably in tying it all together at the end. Very disappointing.Bottom line: a missed opportunity by Goodis. Intriguing, but best left to Goodis fans only."
1,A great show - A horrible treatment!,"5 stars for the show - 1 for the DVD. I have purchased and loved the first three seasons of TAGS. I had plans on buying all of the seasons. BUT - Paramount has done us all wrong. First editing\deleting of scenes in Season 3, and now no laugh tracks on four episodes in Season 4!Paramount my have thought quick, cheap issues would increase their bottom line. Well to that I say penny wise and dollar stupid. [...]"
4,"A good listen, but there are better versions of the music","What caught my eye was ""When your Life was Low"", a song that was first done back in the early 1980's by Randy Crawford on her LP. Between the two recordings, I like her treatment of it better, although the LP is hard to find in CD form. Street Life isn't worth listening to if you remember Randy Crawford and the Crusader's joyous performance. But overall, the CD is a very nice bit of music for a mellow evening. Sample does tend to be a little bit annonying with the simple little runs that make you want to run to a piano and do the same thing...doesn't sound that hard to do or creative. If you want to listen to a great voice, go to the source and Randy Crawford."
4,A very wrongful review,"Saw their concert at Yoshi's in Oakland last year, one of the best I have seen in a very long time. Sample is a legend and has brought the best out in Lalah. Don't listen to the Amazon's review or you will miss music that is soothing to the soul."
4,Never listen to critics,All I can say is that the critics need to chill...literally this is an album for a Sunday afternoon with that someone special.
5,BEAUTIFUL,"Soft, mellow, sweet and peaceful, like a river flowing down to valley, this cd conquers you slowly but steadily after few lsitenings. Lalah's voice is warm and soulful, she has learned the lesson well from her GREAT father, the greatest soul singer ever in my opinion. Mr. Sample is essential, convincing and delivers a perfect tapestry for the expression of Lalah s beautiful voice. When your life was low, One day I'll fly away, Street Life, everything's just perfect. A must!"
5,The Song Lives On,"The entire CD is one hell-of-an-experience. Sample and Hathaway sure know how to tantalize the senses and/or emotions of their listeners. Their offering takes me to a certain place and time everytime I listen to their CD. Is there a DVD version? I am an old Jazz and Blues fan. I have listened to the likes of Hodges, Armstrong, Grover Washington, Miles, Coltrane, Ellington --- you name it. 'The Song' will enjoy its place among the classics. I don't regret buying it from AMAZON."
4,Ignore Amazon's review!,"This is a typical example of not listening to the critics. Does this CD break any new ground? No. Is it somewhat formulatic? Yes. Is Joe Sample's playing akin to noodling? Yes. Does any of this matter? NO! This is a great CD. The songs are very tasteful - very romantic. Plus, and what Amazon misses, is that Lalah Hathaway is the daughter of the great Donny Hathaway, whose brilliant career ended prematurely when he committed suicide in 1979. She may not be the talent he was, but you have to give her a little break just because of who she is. So......light the fire, break open a bottle of wine for you and your partner, and play this CD. You will enjoy it."
2,Formulaic elevator jazz from a former innovator,"Nothing new or original here from Joe, and Lalah's version of ""Fever"" makes me want to put on Peggy Lee's original, or the fine new Jeanie Bryson cover. And as for ""Street Life"", nothing could top the original cut, with that killer arrangement and Randi Crawford's inspired vocal interpretation. Buy an old Joe Sample album or anything by Donnie Hathaway you can get your hands on and give this tired rehash a wide berth."
2,TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED!,"I found this one a little too mellow for my taste, and I consider Joe Sample one of the all-time great jazz pianist. Ms. Hathaway adds absolutely nothing to this CD. In one word, BORING!"
4,Madura was a Terry Kath solo project,"Have not ordered this yet, just saw that it was now available, plan to get it right away. Just wanted to add that the guitar player in Madura is Terry Kath from Chicago. This was a Terry Kath solo project, but he couldn't use his real name at all due to contract obligations. So the ""Terry Kath like guitar solos"" are the real Terry Kath. I have not heard it yet, but a friend of mine has been raving about the guitar playing on this for years."
5,Very good!,"I definatly enjoy this book, I would love to someday become a dog groomer, so this book is very handy in that respect!I would recommend this to anyone!"
2,Wasn't what I expected,The book itself was in excellent condition for being used. I guess I was just expecting a book that would have all dogs old and new breeds in it. I also thought it would have step-by-step what to do for each of the breeds. It only showed certain ones. The pictures weren't that good. All in all it wasn't what I thought it would be.
1,Waste of time,"From the book: ""Zen is nothing"" and ""Zen isn't logical."" So why bother studying it?That pretty much sums up Zen Buddhism, according to Suzuki."
2,"yah, NO!",I bought this book yesterday from borders and spent some with it and ive decided that im going to return it tomorrow
1,Very weak book,This is one of the few books that was so bad that I actually returned it. Very superficial information in the book. Too much focus on where to get drugs across the world. Very little focus on the experience of a world tour. Do not waste your money on this book.
2,Good for teenagers and college kids,"I am disappointed with the book. The book it can be useful for teenagers and college kids that have never wandered very far from home, as it provides a health excitement about world travelling and good anecdotes. However it is shallow, repetitive and opinionated. It is the world as seen from a rich kid perspective. All said, although do not recommend it to travelers, it can be interesting to 16-24 inexperienced wannabe stompers."
4,A CLASSIC... I f you're in your 40s and up!,"Few days ago, I had a meeting with my High School mates (class of '76). Among others, I brought this CD and also ""Deep Purple- Made in Japan (Live)"". My buddies got crazy when I played them! Don't expect perfectly-crafted music and recordings, as with Yes or Genesis digitally remastered albums of the 70s.This is RAW ROCK MUSIC, just for fun and for good memories. Enjoy it!"
4,searching,"Actually,I am looking for a song I listened to 23 years ago and it had words,if I am correct ""...you know that I need a woman"".Was it by Slade - I am not sure.Help me folks, to find it.Peter at Allsorokin@aol.com"
3,Decent sound card,"I think this card is OK. I really like the MX300 more. I would have kept my MX300, but I could not get it to work with my Asus A7V.The sound quality of the MX400 with CD's, MP3's and DVD's are great. Games are ok. Aureal 2.0 chipset is better then the one on this card and EAX.When I play Vampire, I have to turn off the 3D sound hardware to get sound that is not muddy. But when I do that, I do not get any sound effects.Recomendation: Buy a sound card with a Aureal chipset. If you want 100% compatiablitiy get a Creative Labs Live!. Stay away from this card, if not it is a good card for the price."
2,I HATE DIAMOND,"Never will a buy another Diamond product again. This is the last one that gave up on me. I've had 3 Diamond modems, the Rio mp3 player, and the MX400 sound card. None of them lasted over a year. I built my computer in February of 2000, and I decided to use this sound card. It had pretty good sound, but I was always adjusting the volume level because it was different with each device I used, and this came to be really annoying. Last week I put in a new hard drive, and after that, the MX400 no longer worked. Windows didn't recognize it at all even when i tried disconnecting the new hard drive. I'll tired of Diamond products, and i'll never buy anything from them again!Can you imagine that I used to think Diamond was the best."
4,I'm sure its fine...but...,"This is a digital signal. The quality WILL NOT CHANGE based on the cable. Coax, optical, coat hangers, doesn't matter. If it gets a signal it will work. Optical is nice for a lot of reasons, but it will not vary the quality of the sound."
4,Good audio quality,"Transmits audio signals from Sony upconverting DVD Player to my Onkyo reciever quite well. But, I don't detect any quality improvement over the digital co-axial cable that I was using before."
4,The almost perfect GARBO SILENTS collection,"Garbo is my favorite actress and I am very happy to see this collection, which is included in the ""Greta Garbo Signature Collection"" being released at the same time. I am even more happy to see ""The Temptress"" available for the first time. I would give this collection 5 stars if only they had included ""The Torrent"", her first Hollywood film, instead of ""Mysterious Lady"". While the latter has been available on VHS, ""The Torrent"" has never been available on home video, not to mention the fact that this collection would then have included her first three Hollywood films. The only Garbo film previously available on DVD is ""Grand Hotel"", so despite this criticism, I salute TCM Archives for giving us this collection, and especially for releasing ""The Temptress"", never previously available. I also recommend the TCM ARCHIVES LON CHANEY COLLECTION."
3,good sandals but size runs too narrow,I have average medium width feet and these sandals were too tight for me. I gave them to a friend who wears the narrow width of my shoe size and she loves them. So they are great sandals if you have narrow feet.
4,How much sacrifice is too much?,"Fanny Savage has been a self-sacrificing political wife for 19 years. Her husband Will is totally absorbed in himself and his career and he constantly puts Fanny and their daughter Chloe on the back burner. Fanny gives up her career as a partner in her beloved father's wine business and concentrates on furthering Will's career as a Member of Parliament. She also tries to take care of Will's alcoholic sister, Meg, and attempts to patch up her relationship with her mother, who has been absent most of Fanny's life. Finally, Fanny has had enough and she takes a solitary trip to Italy, her father's birthplace, to contemplate her life and to consider whether she wants her marriage to continue. In her novels, Elizabeth Buchan manages to hit on universal themes which most women face and does so with wit, grace, and style. This is not her best book, but it is certainly worthwhile reading."
2,disappointing,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Revenge of the Middle-aged Woman"" - finding it bittersweet but at the same time funny. Thus, I bought the newest book offered by Elizabeth Buchan and expected it to be as good as the previous. I was quite disappointed to find this newest rather shallow -never quite believing in the characters or the storyline. No part of the story was convincing and I forced myself to read to the end and then promptly pitched in the trash can at the airport - something I rarely do! It seemed that she had a contract deadline to fill and so it was written. I'm tired of falling for an author because of previous writing and getting cheated. I'll certainly be more careful next time!"
3,It's great to have spares of these pieces but needs more!,A good connector kit would include the Neoprene coupling washer (in my non-expert opinion) because that is what we have had to replace the most on our kegorator. These parts are good to have as well but this won't get you all the way there if you are having troubles with the O-rings!
5,Great product,"I don't buy expensive watches. I'd beat them up too badly. I wear a watch for three or four years and then just get a new one. The numbers are easy to read. The strap is sturdy yet comfortable. But then, like all the digital watches I've owned, I have to give it to someone under the age of 30 to reset the time when we go to and from DST. I'm enjoying it."
5,Excellent watch,"I bought this watch to use while running and bike riding, rather than using my cellphone. The screen is big and clear enough to read from a distance. Indiglo looks amazing and works wonderfully. Basically, the hardware is exactly what I wanted and hasn't let me down at all.Beyond all of that, my favorite feature is that the instructions for setting the time and date are displayed on the screen, so I'll never have to dig out the manual to figure it out."
4,Gotta love Monster Cables,"Bought these to go with my home entertainment system. Great for long-term use, leaving them connected, but not so much when you need to make changes every so often, as they have a super strong grip once connected. No worries about them getting pulled off accidentally or when anything is shifted. Work great otherwise!"
4,Why this is not a 5 star movie.....,"This is a very fine John Wayne classic, with a host of well-known supporting stars. I was really looking forward to enjoying this superbly acted movie, but something kept disturbing me from time to time.....the multiple sexual references.I looked at the cover of the DVD and I realized that this movie was made just around the time when America was losing her innocence: open sexuality and ""open sexual relationships"" were beginning to flourish, and morals were becoming rather obsolete. It's sad to see this happen to an otherwise very distinguished movie. These detractors did not need to be there, but were obviously put in as a reflection of the decay of religious mores that had so firmly been a part of the American fabric only 10 years before.For this reason, I feel that this blockbuster movie did not deserve 5 stars."
1,"Big, overblown, incredible, boring","Like most late Preminger (the entertaining ""Advise and Consent"" the notable exception) , this is a huge turgid bore. Not much well-staged action, certainly no memorable character moments. Even Jill Haworth's suicide generates little audience shock or reaction simply because the surrounding characters don't seem to give much of a damn (Haworth's death as Kitty in ""Exodus"" seemed much more affecting). Even the reliably terrific Jerry Goldsmith's score is none too interesting, and Kirk Douglas, Patricia Neal and other stalwarts are wasted. Preminger's reputation has diminished since his passing, perhaps because this oversized personality was always his own greatest hornblower."
1,Disc won't work in DVD players in US,You must have a region 2 DVD player for this movie to work..... Which basically means unless you play it on a computer ..... Any US sold DVD player will be region 1 and the movie won't play....don't buy it!
4,John Wayne Movie,"A typical John Wayne story, enjoable but in some ways to obvious and easy to sense the end."
3,In Harm/s Way,"If you like all John Wayne's films, here is one for you. I didn't think it was one his better ones however."
5,John Wayne and Patricia Neal at their best!,One of the all time best of WWII movies. Relatively true to the actual facts of the Pacific war.
4,In Harm's way...,"I also found this to be a good movie, well acted with a good multi-plot storyline. Otto Preminger had a lot of talent to work with, and made the most of it. I stumbled upon this movie late night on cable - and enjoyed it. The fact that it was in black-and-white did not even enter the picture - in fact, it added to the 'grittiness' of the story - and of the people in it. This was a depiction of war, ladies and gentlemen, people didn't have time for genteelness, for tomorrow, they could be dead! I recommend viewing of this picture. If you can get yourself a copy at a good price - then buy it! The only reason why I didn't give it five stars was the (lack of) special effects. Still, very worthy, Four Stars!!"
5,"The 2nd Best War movie ever made, in my opinion.","I have watched this movie many times over the years, and it always has an overwelming effect on me. The way it intertwines the naval war after Pearl, and these men's very private and intmate personal lives. A great part of the fleet was devastated and these men had to use what ever was left to the best of their abilities to win this very important battle. Their patriotism high, and their sacrafice great. John Wayne was at his best in this movie in my opinion.The battle scenes were very convincing, and powerfully depicted.The movie also had some very risque' scenes in it and dealt with some adult manner and behavior which was pretty much taboo for that era.I love this movie, it holds close ranking in my heart right next to Midway. I know I will watch and enjoy it many times again in the years to come."
4,Like this one,Enjoyed reading the romance book. Would recommend this to someone who likes easy romance and suspense together to keep you interested..
1,Really lame,I gave up reading this book because I was a third of the way through the book any nothing was happening. To this point everything was boy/girl angst. I bought it because it was supposed to be a murder mystery. A third of the way and there was no mystery
3,Did I read the same book?,I'm amazed at the incredible reviews for Raspberry Crush. It makes me wonder if I read the same book. The romance was definitely the strength of this novel but the mystery weakened the story as a whole. The characters were likable enough but the conclusions that were jumped to by Billy and others seemed to come out of thin air at times. Some of the elements of the mystery itself were far-fetched at best. It felt like it was the author's first attempt at including a mystery in her romances.
3,"Hey, it's cute.","There seem to be several negative reviews. I admit, Don Bluth as made some crap in the past few years. Titan AE, Anastasia. But you have to admit, this wasn't all that bad. The fact of the matter is, it's for kids. Bluth's movies typically had content that was a quite intense for G-rated movies, this was probably just his break from that. I'll admit, this isn't the best movie ever made, but it did what it set out to do. It made a cute kid movie. And I think they did a good job. Recomended for people who just want to see all of Don Bluth's movies."
5,Great cartoon for KIDS!!!!!!!!,This cartoon is from 1994. I saw it when i was a kid and loved it. I would for sure rate this film a five star for kids.
3,"Excellent Audio, Terrible Video","My title sums it up: The songs are excellent. Superb. But put the DVD on and walk away. Play it loud through your surround sound but do not watch it. Its way too fast. Jumpy. Terrible cuts. Terrible editing. Terrible. Terrible. No shot lasts for more than a few seconds. So dumb. The music, however, more than makes up for the atrocious editing. Well worth it."
5,wow.,"At first I couldn't stand how these stories end, but then I realized that if they ended the way I wished they would, they wouldn't be half as interesting or as thought-provoking. It would just be a well told, cliched archetype we've all heard a million times.Fives points to Vivian Vande Velde for another awesome book!"
3,Rumpa - pum pum,"My littlest boy loves this thing - it makes a lovely drum noise. It has lasted a long time, but it hasn't experienced rough handling, so I'm not sure how strong the drumming surface actually is. As with all toys, he loses interest, but regains it later, so it has remained a staple in the toy box."
5,Thoughtful,"There is not doubt that my ""purpose"" in life goes in and out of focus. And right now, I am unfortunately in one of those lost periods of my life. I have tried many times to write myself through this process, making lists of goals and areas of my life that need improvement. But it is hard for me to deal with how trite my goals look on paper and, as I found out from reading this book, I stop before I completed a critical step in this exercize.For the majority of the book, Kerr does not offer advice that the reader hasn't heard before. But this is actually very helpful, since he presents things in a clear and earest manner. I was won over. He even got a cynic like me to reconsider the wisdom of advice like, ""Show others that you appreciate them."" And he offers suggestions on how to work on some of these principles. This is a very helpful little book."
2,High definition setup disk,Product did not contain everything needed. I would not recommend it to a friend.
5,"Great series, great finalé!","I was a little worried about how things were going to be wrapped-up but I need not worry. The whole series was a great science-fiction read and this book never became dull while reading. Yeah, there are some typos but get over it! Read and move on, don't dwell on silly things! Again, really good book and series."
4,Excellent close to an excellent series,"I eagerly awaited each of the books in this series, and was so excited to read the conclusion, I purchased the hardback version - something I rarely do. Although the conclusion almost felt like a let down, this was mostly due to the fact that I wanted the series to continue. I have never read a science fiction book that captured a reader's interest in the characters so well (except perhaps for Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card - though that was very different). Most amazing is the background of the universe - without going into a lot of detail, Hamilton managed to flesh out a very deep universe, that you could not only still relate to, but seems to be quite possible. If the future looks like Hamilton paints it, I wish I could visit, and I enjoyed the time Hamilton gave us."
2,Disapointed with the end,"I read all of this series and enjoyed them greatly. Five stars to all and worth the price - until this latest. After a wonderful world building and setting up the fearsome returned dead, the author solves all with a classic Deus Ex Machina. I was terribly disappointed but will probably continue to buy his works."
3,Good but.....,"I could not wait to get my hands on the softcover. The book was captivating for the first 90% but in the end it was all too hurried and too convenient. Still, Hamilton deserved the praise for managing the characters and storyline across the 5 books so well although some of them seem secondary to the plot. For instance, Ione Saldana was such a central character in the first 4 books but became a bystander in this final installment. There was no ""Aha!"" just the ""I see.."" and lots of it. Overall it is recommended if only because the first 4 was so good and I just want to keep on going."
3,The Beginning of the End,"This is the first half of the final book of ""The Night's Dawn,"" a novel of about 4,200 pages. It really needs to be read in order, starting with ""The Reality Dysfunction"" and continuing with ""The Neutronium Alchemist"" or much will be lost. The Mortonridge story drags, but don't give up; the best is yet to come!watziznaym@gmail.com"
1,terrible is too good a word,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen. And I like cheesy diaster movies!I look forward to the Saturday SyFy movies. I enjoy them (yes, I realize there should be a 12-step program for that). But this...horrible. It just stinks.The acting was stilted, the script was lame.. I could go on and on. I was really suprised by how bad this really was. The scene where the Snow Patrol officer warns the snowboarders about the danger - ugh! Cringe worthy. Even Mega-Piranha had better acting than this.I don't care if this movie is on sale for $1.00 don't blow your money or time on it. It isn't campy, it isn't semi-good, it is just full on crap."
3,Amazon Deflates Bubbles,"Amazon sampler plays Gordon Jenkins's recording of I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles with Artie Shaw playing solo clarinet, then playing in unison with Gordon Jenkins's one-finger style. This is how I remember the boxed 45-rpm album in 1954. It is the reason I oedered the reissue CD. But when the CD came, there was no Artie Shaw--only a mixed chorus of voices.It was a disappointment that does not ease, and it relegates the CD to the unplayed, unwanted stack. What Amazon offers is not what Amazon delivers. I wonder if Billy Butterfield gets the same treatment in Stardust--or even Artie Shaw on Begin the Beguine."
5,Required reading for any ISP startup,This book has undoubtedly earned a place on the bookshelf of today's ISP owner. Its contents were invaluable information required for the business plan I prepared for an ISP/ASP business.
5,Excellent history.,"From the landing of the 1st Light Antiaircraft Missile Battalion in 1965 to the final liftoff of the last U.S. Embassy guards in April 1975, the U.S. Marine Corps suffered more total casualties in Vietnam than in all of World War II.Their story of their bravery and sacrifice is well told in one compact but remarkably comprehensive work; thoroughly researched, admirably readable, with a notably well-organized and complete index which makes finding a particular unit or action fast and easy.With photos and bibliography, Murphy's work will stand as an excellent one-volume history of the Corps in Vietnam.(The numerical rating above is an ineradicable default setting within the format of this page. This reviewer does not employ numerical,ratings)."
5,"""One"" of a kind!","""The One"" is an awesome song, great to dance to, and fun to sing to. The lyrics are sweet and the voices are incredible! A must hear song for any pop fan!"
4,the one,"loved it, but not the best that the boys have done. the video was the bomb, having been to the concert it took me back there."
3,"Speaking of &#65533;The One,&#65533;....","....I'm working on a song titled ""The One I Love,"" which will not unfortunately be sung by these dudes and will not bear the same relation to this song (God forbid!). Disco influence. Hmph!"
2,Failed in France - Loose fit wouldn't stay plugged in,"In order to use the converter in France, I had to set objects up against the back of the converter to keep it plugged in. Alone, the converter would sit loosely in the wall socket and fail to connect."
4,"Easy to use, works as advertised.","This comes in a set with a clear tube that fits all 3 in if you want to travel with all of them. I used these when I went around Europe for 6 weeks and worked really well. These fit better in all sockets than the All-In-One adapters but I brought one of those too for the flexibility in smaller form factor. They both have their uses but if you're looking for one off adapters, these make a good set."
4,Works well and stacks together nicely,"I'm on the road about 20% of the time, mostly to international destinations, so I'm always on the lookout for travel gadgets that are easy to carry around. I had seen a version of this adapter in the Novotel Hong Kong and finally found it here.The plugs nestle together nicely (the stock picture doesn't do it justice), although I'm a bit concerned about the long term quality given that it's plastic and I tend to have a lot of things jammed in my shoulder bag. It's easy to tell if you've left an adapter behind because you'd notice the stack wouldn't be complete.I've used this successfully in Asia (Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China), as well as Australia. Yes, there is an adapter for Australia, you have to turn the prongs on the US adapter to fit the Oz electrical outlets, but it only takes 2 seconds."
4,Good. I used it for Australian to US conversion.,"I bought an electric razor on my recent trip to Australia, bought this converter to use back in the U.S.Works fine."
5,Perfect Adapter for European Travel,"Love this adapter set. The fact that the adapters plug into one another keeps them conveniently all in one place--instead of having three loose pieces. When you're living out of a suitcase, this particular feature is especially handy. The slots accept two or three-prong plugs, and unlike some individual adapters I've had in the past, the slots stayed snug. I plan to buy another set. I recommend pairing it with the Monster MP OTG400 BK Outlets To Go 4 Outlet Travel Power Strip since I found European hotels are often stingy with outlets. Together, the Sima set and the Monster power strip were the perfect solution for charging multiple electronic devices and powering my dual-voltage hair dryer, steamer, and flat iron. (Please note: these are adapter plugs only and do not convert the voltage.)"
1,Just Naked Ladies,"I enjoy camp and excess as much as the next person, unless the next person had anything to do with this release. This is mearly an excuse for the Troma team, which has made some entertaining movies, to be social critics and show some naked women on tv. Very poorly done, don't waste your time."
1,older is better,"over it is an awesome band don't get me wrong, but their style has changed, go listen to ""hindsight...20/20"" and tell me that they havn't changed. They got played on 99.1 whfs the other day though that was cool."
3,"After Mating, a disappointment","Mortals features much of what I love about Rush's writing style as it takes us back to an Africa perceived through the eyes of disaffected, jaded ex-pats. However, Rush seemed to be recycling many of his entertaining/enlightening quotes and observations found in Mating. What was he (and for that matter, his editor) thinking? I groaned every time I saw a regurgitated ""Zeno's arrow..."" or bon mot from Mating. Despite the disappointments, I am still enthralled by Rush's characters and his slice-of-life descriptions of Africa."
3,A good book but nothing to write home about,"After Mating and Whites I was ready for more Norman Rush. I love his prose and intellect. He is a master at character development. Mortals had its good points and I don't regret reading it but I think I would have been fine if I had not read it. The first 300 pages were slow and I would have given up a couple of times had it not been from the other reviews I read and my love of Rush. I read this after reading Anna Karenina, a tough act to follow! It was a pretty good book but, in my opinion, not worthy of all the superlative reviews it received. While I find myself thinking of Ray (I feel like I know him well and that is striking to me,) I wouldn't recommend the book to anyone. I recommend Mating and Whites all the time without reservation."
1,Horrible,"I read enthusiastically so-called 'novels of ideas' -- but this is bereft of ideas and really is junk. I am so mad I wasted my time reading 700 pages of small type text. The characters do not act or speak true to them themselves, especially the principal woman character, Iris. There's a one-chapter speech that at least is shorter than the speech in Atlas Shrugged, but must be on what people base the contention that this is an intellectual novel -- boring, boring, boring. The prose is fairly leaden. The setting is exotic, but one doesn't really learn that much about Botswana as a result (see Kapuchinski, Shadow of the Sun to learn about Africa). Maybe people like the fairly abundant sex or sexual content in the book.I could not more highly discourage you from reading this book. Amazing to me the positive reviews it has received. Read Madison Smartt Bell's triology on Haiti instead."
1,Black screen with costly repairs,"Great buy for someone who has money to waste. I purchased this TV less than 2 years ago and it has stopped functioning. While listening to the television and reading a book, I looked up at the TV and noticed there was no picture, just a black screen. After several attempts at contacting RCA I was advised that the TV was no longer under warranty and I would be responsible for the very costly repair. With todays techology there is no reason why a television would have such a short usage period."
4,And now I know,I have wanter to know what experiences a good shooting writer had to form the opinions that he expressed and now I know.
2,it was ok,it was ok but didnt seem to realistic. some of the storyline wasnt very well explained. the cast was weak.
2,Older Musicals,"When I bought this soundtrack, I forgot one major thing. A musical recorded many years ago is probably not going to have great sound. Well, no stereo, scratchy, and echoing sums up this disc. If you like original its good, otherwise you would be better to forget this one!"
5,"O'Boogie, Oh so fine!","John Lennon is shown here in this box set as a true individual that he was. Afforded independence to do what he wanted, one gets a feeling of honesty which one rarely hears from major artist. On the other hand, if your not a complete Lennon nut like myself, I wouldn't buy this set. I would try a ""greatest"" CD first then if it's to your liking, come backand get this Box set. To me, this set was just what the doctor order...I needed a little of Dr. Winston O'Boogie to get me through the ""Holidays""."
3,Hold that line... hold that line... hold that line....,"This album presents the potential purchaser with an imaginary line. Whether or not you should buy ANTHOLOGY really depends upon which side of that line you're on. For completists, LENNON * ANTHOLOGY is a godsend or revelation; for the casual fan, this collection is a jumbled rough-cut head-scratcher. If you don't own all of John's solo albums, you probably won't want this one.More so than the BEATLES ANTHOLOGY series, this set is replete with fragments, false starts, incomplete demos, slight or off-key vocals and silly chatter.

5,HISTORY IS NOT A FARSE TO BE REPEATED.,"Really,an important book that takes account of many anglesthe events of that period.Smyrna is much more than a city ofalmost 3500000 inhabitants.Istanbul,Thessaloniki and Smyrnarepresent a special way of quality living during 18,19,20 thcenturies."
3,awakening!,"the occupation of istanbul by turks starts in 1453. from then on all the nations under ottoman rule did well. at certain times, there were numerous christian and non turkish rulers in the empire. i wonder what happened so suddenly that after 470 years turks decided to kill non-turkish elements. they could have done it when they had absolute power, but they did not. therefore people who come up with accusation should start thinking about social, economical, geographical and international facts to comprehend what really happened and why. remember, anatolia was under the occupation of french, italian, english and russians when all greek and/armenian suffering took place. greeks were mainly backed up by british, armenians by russian. in addition to these, the ottoman military was dissolved by the invading powers. how did all these things take place under their control?"
1,Smyrna 1922,"This book has been popular, because no one independently checked the statements in the book. Many of the facts came from the papers of Admiral Mark Bristol, USN, in the National Archives. To that extent, the book is accurate. However, Ms. Housepian is an Armenian hater of Turks, and she created some ""history"" when she wrote the book. I know, because I have boxes of original documents left by the man she credits with the rescue, Asa K. Jennings, my Grandfather. His assistant was my Father, Asa W. Jennings. Ms.Housepian does Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and Turks a disservice by not sticking to the truth. This is not a scholarly work. The best book written on the disaster of Smyrna is Ships of Mercy by Christos Papoutsy. That book contains some of the many original records of the events, and is a must read for anyone interested in Smyrna, Greece, and the Greek, Armenian and Jewish people. Roger Jennings"
4,Wild about Harry,"The movie is captivating, and the acting is good, but nobody seems to be able to imitate the coastal Maine accent right, and Andre was a wild Harbor seal, not a trained sea lion. I lived near Boston in the 70s, and Andre was quite the celebrity every October when he arrived at the New England Aquarium, and every TV news station tracked his progress when he left in the spring, based on eyewitness reports. He was a real charmer who knew how to work a crowd. He was a wild seal, but his heart belonged to Harry, and his love for Harry always took him back to Rockport year after year. I saw Andre perform 3 times, including his last performance, when he half-heartedly did a few tricks then raced out to sea for the last time. For me, the movie wasn't as good as the real thing. But if you never saw Andre, and you want a well-done, funny, heartwarming family movie, this is it. Enjoy!"
4,"Andre is a very good video and is compatable with the book, Andrew the Famous Harbor Seal",A very entertaining and heartwarming video of a family who had a love of animals and a seal who became famous. It is a good video for young and old alike.
2,Unable to use,"Yes, this is very quiet. Yes, it doesn't take up much space.This wasn't on for more than 2 days before the ionizer, producing negative ions, within the filters bothered me so much that I had to return it. My nose, eyes, throat, and eventually chest burned after only 5 minutes, then 3, then less than that. When I called the company, the rep said I must be especially sensitive to the ions released. They gave me a return number and I sent it back for a refund, which I received.I bought this because it was a ""low producer"" of ions. These ions will harm you if in sufficient quantities. The purifier was as far away from me as possible, at the outer range of square feet specified in the advertisement."
2,Malfunctioned within two weeks...had to return it.,"I did some research and noticed several units that looked like they all had the same design...I thought they would all be the same so I bought the most economical. I received the unit and it worked fine for the first few days. Actually the clips inside the cover were broken but I thought it wasn't a big deal. After the first couple of days, the machine started emitting a foul smell like something was burning but I thought it would go away after a few days. It began to get progressively worst and after a couple of weeks I decided to act and return the thing. I gave the technology another chance but opted for the more expensive model. I immediately noted the difference and quality - I have had the other unit for several months and still running as it was on the first day."
2,"Love the product, but won't turn on after six months","I bought this filter as a gift for the house as we were experiencing allergy-like symptoms in winter. Worked great, easy to use, great results, and clean up/maintenance is pretty straight forward and easy.It's been six months and now it won't turn on. The manual only says to make sure it's plugged in, and check of the cover is loose. I've taken great care of the machine, checked the filters when it needed and followed all the directions.It's a bit disappointing to see such malfunction, and it's even more disappointing to see no customer service available. My only option is to contact the distributor which Amazon.com won't accept returns (no options for exchange?)Love the machine, but it's quite upsetting that I payed $200 for it to work six months."
1,"Look at negative feedback, it's true!",I never take the time to write reviews but just want to warn others. I received the unit today and it seemed to work fine for a few hours. Than the replace filter and clean grid indicator lights turned on. I don't know why they did but I opened up unit and all filters looked new and clean. I followed (poorly written) instructions on resetting the indicators but they won't turn off. There is no customer service number to call. The button panel on unit is so cheaply made. Not worth 200.00 dollars and returning first thing tomorrow. I also bought 2 Hamilton Beach smaller air purifiers and they seem to be working well. Don't waste your money on this. If you need more sq ft coverage I suggest maybe few smaller better quality purifiers.
1,Not Working,"I received a non-operational one with two broken tabs on the front cover. Thanks to Amazon, I returned it. I purchased Sanyo ABC-VW24 Air Washer Air Purification System instead. I'm very happy with the purchase and I purchased the second one."
3,A fitting anthology,"Like the city itself, these pieces are all over the place; most of them are rather mediocre, but there are a few gems to be found."
2,Not so genius,"I am pretty disappointed with this DVD. I thought my daughter would enjoy watching it because she loves animals. I think that there was not a lot of consideration in picking the music that went with the different animal groups. The frames/views change very quickly throughout the whole video. Also, there was no reason to add in the baby genius cartoon characters into the animal scenes - it adds nothing to the viewing experience, is distracting, and feels like blatant marketing. Particularily, when the animal viewing is over, a ""music video"" with the baby genius characters plays which does not fit at all with the rest of the video and gives the very clear impression of brainwashing and product placement. No thank you baby genius. I'd rather have bought a national geographic film."
5,Dachshund Love,"This book helped me learn more about Dachshunds. I would recommend this book to anyone who is thinking about getting a Dachshund. It tells you everything about what a Dachshund is,it says it's traits, how to properly groom it it's health problems and much more. It helped me alot."
4,READ THE FINE PRINT- You *CAN* upload mic recordings,"A previous reviewer, who doesn't appear to actually own this product, claimed that you cannot upload your recordings from the RH10 to a PC. This is not true. All Hi-MD recorders allow USB upload of mic and analog line recordings. You can also record in PCM and upload in Wav format! No matter which Hi-MD recorder you buy, be sure to download Sonic Stage 3.4. You'll be a happy camper.If you're a Mac user, you should get an M100 or M10. These will only allow USB upload of PCM recordings to Wav on a Mac. Sonic Stage will not work with Mac, but these units are still useful in the limited way I've just described."
3,It gets worse the longer you have it,"I bought another MD player becasue my old one broke and I have a huge collecction of MDs. Id prefer a new MP3 player.It was great the first year. The second year the remote went bad, which is not digital. It would have been better if it was digital like others I have had. It cost $50 to replace. The shock proof performance degrades over time. Not sure why that would be but after 3 years it has become VERY sensitive.Its an attractive MD player, its great but for the price......look somewhere else."
1,Beware ordering from Amazon.com,"This product arrived on schedule. My first instinct is to always look at packaging to see if it's been opened before. This one had been. A piece of packing tape that sealed the outer cardboard shell was missing as indicated by blemished strip of cardboard. Opened the tool case and found acrylic plates floating around out of their slots, which I don't believe could happen during shipping if they had been in their proper slots. Noticed small dent by power cord receptacle which was caused by something sharp like an awl. Inspected acrylic plates closely and found many scratches. One quick release latch was completely broken off which also couldn't have happened during shipping. After seeing these things I immediately packed it back up and ordered a replacement. This unit was NOT NEW. In addition they expect me to pay for shipping to return the item. We'll see about that! I am very disappointed."
5,Good Stuff,"Love my router! Great right out of the box. Easy tool adjustment/change. I have arthritus and this tool is a blessing. Enough power for any job, big or small."
1,Cheap motor burned out,"I bought this router after much research and was happy as a clam to have it. Used it for a few projects and then I got busy with other stuff. After much time, I picked it up again for a project and while using it the motor burned out. My actual total usage time was less than 20 hours but the warranty had expired (at the time the warranty period was shorter than the current period) because it just sat in its box for a long time.Took it to a local authorized dealer and motor replacement $ was as much as a new router. I seriously thought about buying a new router but I had a D-handle for this one that I really liked. Asked it to be repaired but wait! The motors were back ordered (you guessed it - from China) and it took 3 months to get the thing fixed. Since then its working fine but I am staying away from this brand in general."
3,Good product for the money,"After receiving the router I noticed it was missing the centering cone and pin. I called customer service and had a difficult time with an unqualified agent. She had a very hard time understanding what parts I was missing. Finally we got that resolved and she had the missing parts shipped. Since then I have read other reviews and found that this is a very common problem and many have had the same parts missing upon delivery.So far I am satisfied with this purchase. I have used it both as a plunge router and table mounted. One small criticism I have is that when the plunge router is turned with the bit facing up, the plunge action is disabled."
2,Missing parts - have not used,"I just received my DW618PK and opened it up. Like a few other recent reviewers, I too am missing the centering tool. I've used a number of Dewalt products and this is the first time a piece was missing. Hopefully it was an oversight that Dewalt can quickly correct. I contacted Dewalt and asked it to send me the missing part. Once I hear back from Dewalt and use the product, I will amend my review as appropriate as I have not yet used the router."
5,Holistic Guide for A Healthy Dog,"This diet has been backed by years of documented laboratory research. I had read books and listened to others regarding raising my dogs the way nature intended but only Wendy's book really made sense to me. Since switching my dogs from ""cardboard"" dog food to raw I wonder why it took me so long! My dogs are thriving on the Volhard Natural Diet. Not only does the book advise on diet but also vaccinations, kinesiology, homeopathy, complementary therapies and the five element theory. Thanks, Wendy, for a life style change for my dogs . . . and me!"
4,80% Spectacular.,"This book is filled with some very very useful information, but some of it should be taken with a grain of salt. Like some other reviews have mentioned a few of the diagnostic methods are a bit too neuvo-hippie for my relatively conservative tastes, but all the information on what is (and isn't) put into your dog food was dead on useful. It's absolutely indespensible information for anyone who truly loves thier dog.The recipes were good, but they are a bit too involved to be realistic for most people. The sections on diseases, allergies, dietary deficiencies are all filled with useful information.I would recommend this AND Dr. Pitcairn's complete guide to natural health for dogs and cats to anyone who is even thinking of getting a dog, ESPECIALLY a large breed dog."
2,Not for Kindle!,An interesting book but not for purchase on kindle. I couldn't back reference or get to where I wanted to go. I guess reference books don't work with kindle.
2,Disorganized,"I found this book very disorganized and difficult to look things up in. Maybe if someone just wanted to read it from front to back for fun, it would be okay, but if you're looking for specific information on how to treat a certain disorder, it's pretty useless and frustrating. Not a good reference book."
1,one of the worst movies ever made,"It's called character development, Mr. Figgis. If you can take a few mins to show Nicolas Cage was a film industry exec who's lost his family, then surely you can take 2 mins to explain why Elisabeth Shue is a hooker with perfect grammar and huge bookshelves in her apt. Female characters aren't just sympathy and sex machines that exist only to listen to the male characters whine throughout the movie. Why can't we give less than 1 star on amazon.com?"
2,Seriously?,"This movie is terrible. Its only redeeming quality is the committed (and Oscar-winning) performance of Nicolas Cage. The fact that Elisabeth Shue was nominated for an Oscar for her performance is a crime. She's awful. She has two facial expressions. She isn't even able to muster up one tear. It's a horrible, horrible, horrible performance.The movie has no plot. Everything about it is gratuitous. The cinema verite feel that writer/director Mike Figgis went for is a joke; the movie isn't even vaguely realistic. There's almost zero backstory, and the characters are completely one-dimensional. It's impossible to relate to these characters. In what universe does this film take place?The screenplay is chock-full of cheesy lines. Avoid at all costs. Two stars for Cage; zero for everyone else."
3,Overrated acting,"I was shocked that Nicholas Cage actually won a Best Actor award for his performance in this film. Cage is not a very strong actor and all he did was simply act drunk throughout the entire film; 1995 most have been a pretty slow year. The screenplay wasn't bad although it was a little cheesy. Worth renting, but not buying."
2,So What If He Drank Himself to Death?,"Viewed: 10/03, 2/13Rate: 42/13: Damn, want to see the most overrated film of 1995? It's, without a doubt, Leaving Las Vegas. The Academy Award committee has a long, extensive history of giving out nominations and wins to actors and actresses playing drunks and prostitutes. And what do you know? For their absolutely mediocre performances, Nicolas Cage won it, and Elisabeth Shue got nominated. Somehow, there must be a link between alcohol/sex and the members of the Academy. Let me tell you: anyone can play a drunk, and it takes no talent to pull it off. And anyone can play a hooker, and it takes no talent to pull it off. That's exactly what the two leads did in Leaving Las Vegas. There is no story either, and it is a one big nothing. All in all, there are way better films than Leaving Las Vegas such as Honeymoon in Vegas and Swingers."
2,Great for Overview; Bad for Small Details,"Preparing for a trip to Mallorca, I borrowed a German map from a neighbor. It included topographical detail, hiking paths, and residential clusters; so I expected the same from my Globetrotter map. Alas, all those important details were missing. It looks good, however, for driving, and has a good overview of cities and towns, with detailed street maps. It also shows beaches in yellow, while the German map only named them. So, I'm taking both maps!"
5,Good reading for starters and advanced scholars.,I read both Greek and Hebrew and I read all sorts of materials on bible studies. but every scholar needs a short concise book on these subjects. This book will give you a simple and clear statements on these advanced subjects. Beginners will receive a short idea on even the most advanced subjects.
2,Not even good apologetic,"Simply terrible. The book is so patronizing that it sometimes appears it was written for children. Whatever little (and often twisted) information it contains can be found in much better books by much better authors. I was very disappointed with this book, which had so much potential."
3,Paid too much,I don't feel like its worth what I paid ($50). The hinges on the lid are loose and rattles when you open and close it. The box itself is nice a sturdy but the hinges and latch are low quality.
5,Hilarious! A real talent!,"As a first generation fan of Freddie, I watched Chico and the Man when it first aired. I can remember purchasing this on vinyl when it first came out, and have kept it after all these years. It's great to have it on CD. Freddie was an excellent comedian, and I would highly recommend this CD. It is observational comedy with an ethnic twist. If you are hyper sensitive and extremely politically correct, maybe you won't find the ethnic humor very funny. But things were different in the 70's and I find nothing wrong in the way in which this was done. Freddie was very funny and didn't say anything inappropriate as far as I'm concerned. He is missed by lots of fans. Now I wish they would put out complete seasons of Chico and the Man!!"
3,Groovy trip back,"If you grew up in the ""days of agonizing reappraisal"", the 60's, these documentaries will be a fun reminder of the music of the time. the conversations with the artists are an interesting retrospective, they give you insight as to what was going on in their minds at the time. I love 60's culture and would receomend this for those who want to research the era. If you are just all about the music, you might have more fun just playing your old records, uh I mean cd's"
1,"Very Upset With the Distributor, Beauty.com","I purchased this product on September 1, 2011. While the blush looks nice it was, unfortunately, totally shattered when I opened the package. I sent two emails to the distributor, Beauty.com, seeking to return the product but received no response. My next step is to work through either Amazon or my credit card company to get a refund, steps I should not have to take. I will never order from this distributor again."
1,Amazon Return Policy,"I am usually satisfied when buying from Amazon, but I overlooked the No Return policy on compasses. My Silva Guide Compass arrived with a large air bubble in the chamber. It probably works OK, but likely would eventually leak its internal fluid. I've sent it to the manufacturer - I don't know if they will provide a refund or replacement.My advice- pay a few more bucks and see what you're buying when shopping for a compass."
2,Poor shipping,"I ordered the product for a specific job, the shipping was delayed twice past the date I needed it. I treid to cancel but it turned into a hassle so I have 2 compasses. This one is honest barely better than the $4 walmart one I ran out to purchase in a pinch. Very dissapointed with amazon on this one."
1,Hope,The tool came with air leaking from the trigger. The direction lever is very hard to move. You can stop the drill from turning with your finger.Seller made contact and promised to fix the problem.
4,Clear diagrams and togetherness,"I found the drawings clear and easy to follow to work along with my kids. True, the photo of the finished product was black and white, and not that useful, but the instructions were fine. I was glad the floss was included so we didn't have to run out and buy more right at first. This is a good activity for a parent and child to do together."
2,"great memory, bad book","Obviously, I am the only philistine here, but I disliked the book, and gave up after the first 100 pages or so. The reviews here call the book tedious, irritating, haphazard, etc., yet they obviously found something to savor in it. Alas, I am not one of them. Perhaps it was the writing style that did me in, as I am not familiar with the author's other books. But I do think most memoirs benefit from having at least a rudimentary linear format. This book was like what the mind may do before you fall fully asleep - it plays hopscotch and images, people, places, etc. all tumble about willy nilly. I don't think imposing a more straightforward format on your memories necessarily destroys the beauty of them. It's just common courtesy if they're going to be out there for the public to cnosume."
3,A literary autobiography by a brilliant man,"This is the autobiography of the author of Lolita. Nabokov was a Russian intellectual born to a rich family in czarist Russia in 1899. His father being a member of the Kerensky government, they had to flee the Bolsheviks.Nabokov wrote about his tutors, his girlfriends, and his other interests, including a fascination with butterflies. There are no exciting events in the book. But we get to know Nabokov, a craftsman with language, both in English and Russian. He was a likeable and brilliant man.As for why this book is considered the greatest autobiography ever written, or one of the very finest works of the 20th Century, you got me. It has a style. Is that enough for you?"
2,Bollywood copies Hollywood (again!) but fails again!,Another poor copy of a Hollywood movie the class movie 'Memento'. Everything Hollywood does right Bollywood does wrong. Over scripted with holes so big it's just laughable that they get made!...Do yourself a favor don't watch second rate copycat scripts; watch the superior original (Hollywood) version 'Memento' and forget that Ghajini even existed!
1,Don't Buy..............,"This is a pretty poor attempt to explain any type of relationship in the gay/lesbian world. It has no basis in Psychology (Gays/Lesbians choosing their ""lifestyle?""...long ago proven wrong), and the whole idea behind the book seems to be to jump on the ""spiritual band wagon."" Unforntunately, rather than having any substance, this book seems to be more of an autobiography than anything else."
2,Limited Capability,"This works as advertised provided that the outlet being tested is powered up. On the other hand, if the circuit is not powered up, this circuit breaker finder is useless. If that distinction had been made clear in the item description, I would not have purchased this item. It is because that the requirement that the circuit being tested be powered was not specified that I gave it two stars."
2,tricky auto sensitivity,"I just got the Zircon CF12 and tried it for the first time. It has an ""continuous automatic calibration"" function. According to the instructions on the unit, you ""scan over all circuit breakers"" then ""rescan until the green LED only lights over one breaker. Rescanning causes unit to learn which signal is strongest."" I found this setup a bit tricky to use for the first time. It also means that it cannot be used to find other plugs on the same circuit, or to find wires in walls, as people do with the manually calibrated units.Also, the unit cannot really distinguish the two sides of half-width breakers. Maybe I'll like it better when I get used to it."
1,Zircon circuit finder makes no sound,"This is the second one I have gotten with the same problem. I sent the first one back, and it was exchanged very quickly by Amazon, because when it would find the right breaker, it would light up, but not make a sound. Now I have gotten the second one and it does the same thing. I have emailed Zircon and asked them about it, but they seem to ignore my emails. I don't know what to do, it works with the light, but it does not make a sound like all the literature says it should. That includes the paperwork I got with the unit. Not a problem with Amazon, who gave me splendid service but with Zircon, who won't even answer my inquiries about the unit."
2,Not True About the Specs on this Laptop,At first I was amazed and was ready to buy the this laptop when I saw what I did see. But then I thought no way this has to be to true. And well it was. I did some reviewing and found out that this laptop does not have a 80 GB HDD. If you use the model number and...look it up it says there that is a 20GB HDD...
1,I wasted a Saturday for this??,"I'm not a big fan of Sue Civil-Brown's books to begin with; her characters are always way too 'flaky' for me. I had hoped that I'd enjoy Tempting Mr. Wright. I didn't, but not because of any 'flakiness,' although that was certainly there, just not as prevalent as in her previous books. TMW had *way* too much petty bickering between Tess and Jack, especially after they came to realize the extent of their feelings towards each other. Where was the romance?? Where was the emotional dialog? The whole story just dragged along; I believe Tess and Jack didn't even kiss until halfway through the book.If you're looking to read a good romantic comedy, check out Susan Elizabeth Phillips, Rachel Gibson, or the more recent books by Susan Andersen; don't be 'Tempted' to spend your money on 'Mr. Wrong.'"
3,Too Many Characters!!!,"This story could have been a pageturner for sure had it not had all the characters. It seemed like there was a new character in every chapter. This storyline was hard to follow and at times, it was extremely slow. It took me close to a month to finish this book. When I finally got to the end and discovered the killer I was SOOOOO disappointed.I would not recommend this book at all."
2,A chore to read,"This book contains some very valuable insights toward interpreting various books. Unfortunately, these insights are all presented in the first chapter, and are subsequently beat into the reader's head repeatedly afterwards. The author pulls out every obscure, thirty-letter vocabulary word you can find in Webster's, and some that I couldn't. The most useful part of the book is the Prologue. The Prologue is extremely well-written, and sums up Armstrong's entire argument in about ten pages. I would suggest that potential readers read the Prologue first, skip the Introduction altogether, and take the rest of the book as they may."
2,"Rambling. No music or production value, just voices droning on. Sorry.","No music or production value, just voices droning on. Sorry, wanted to love it and I'm glad the story was told, but especially the two fireman going on and on was too much."
1,I can not believe buying this product is a disaster,"I just got the RH910 for me, and the RH10 for my wife.After reading so many good reviews, I do not believe these 2 little guys are that bad.I transferred about 150 mp3 to RH910. It did not complained when transferring. But when playing back, only about 10 files can be played. All of the rest just got a Can not play message. Why? Do not tell me because I do not know how to use the software. I had a first generation MD player. The software for the MD player is much harder to use.Then I gave RH10 a shot. Guess what? Even worse. All of the 150 files even can not be transferred. I just got a message said can not transfer. No reasons.Hahaha. It is funny, right?"
3,Wonderful parallel history.,"Few writers understand history and how to use it as a base for fantasy as well as Guy Kay -- and here, as always, he does not opt for the too-usual pseudo-medieval world. This time, he uses Byzantium, and his Sarantium almost lives up to the dangerous, convoluted, fascinating original. But (isn't there always a ""but""?) the book is VERY leisurely. It contains some wondrous things, intelligent characters (Kay's specialty), imagery to stop the heart, but one does ask, what's the story? Do I care enough to read the next volume? Maybe not ... It'll have to be really compelling."
4,Skilled Writer,"Guy Gavariel Kay really deserves to be one of the authors selected for Legends II, if Robert Silverberg ever find the time and determination again to compile it.And no author can marry history and fantasy with such balance and skill as Kay. A truly magnificent result - Sailing to Sarantium."
4,Cute choker!,This was so cute but broke right away...I was able to fix it so my daughter could still wear it...however i didn't try and return it ....can't complain for the price though...it still looked cute...wold by from seller again!
1,pretty bad,"wow. very disappointing. I love books, most of my furniture is bookcases, and I read everything dozens of times. I have had these three Nancy Kress books for several years, but have only read them two or three times. I had forgotten why, until I read them again this week. Now I remember.The series started out interesting, had a bland sequel, and went over a cliff in the finale. No noticeable character development, trite and unbelievable plot with artificial twists, and has nothing to be said that could not be fitted onto the back of a small book jacket.DOn't waste your money, go get cj cherryh or elizabeth moon instead."
2,Doesn't Cover Quattro Pro,"This book came up sixth when I did a search on Amazon for ""Quattro Pro 12."" However, looking at its Index online, it contains less than two pages of information on Quattro Pro."
2,Disappointed,"Having read the other reviewer comments, I am disappointed in this novel. I have not finished it yet and I am dragging myself through the story as if I were the 85 year old title character.In addition to finding the pace of the story to be slow, I find the use of time to be inconsistent. There is an obvious juxtaposition of time periods in the story, which is fine, but within the main time period shifts, there are also slippages between time periods that I find annoying.There are sentence structures that I find difficult to follow, perhaps because I did not grow up in the South.I may do this story an injustice by reading it while I am commuting by train but I am on page 229 of 344 pages, and I am still waiting for the story to catch my interest."
3,My new friend,"I bought this Violin a few days ago and already received it. The bridge was easy to install, and tuning is a process. I am just learning and even with the tuning half done it sounds wonderful already. I only had a few pet peeves. Unlike the picture in a similar product page from this seller, my case did not come with the cloth. Also, the delivery people (not sure if it was ups??) beat the heck out of the box. The rosin came in pieces and the strings were everywhere including one having a kink due to rough handling. The violin itself is very pretty and sounds better then i ever thought. Now all i need is a cloth and rosin and i'm good to go. Tuning is a bit difficult though so i'm spending an extra $3-$5 to have a music store tune it for me. I bought the Violin for dummies book and it's helping me a lot. i was even able to play several notes...even though i don't know how to read music."
2,Bleh.................,"I will be completely honest, I am an alternative model, so the use of this violin was simply for prop purposes, however after my photos shoot, I was going to hand this violin over to a friend who was interested in becoming a player...WELL....I'm no violin musician, but I can tell a piece of crap when I see it! Like I said, I only used it for photos...but tuning wise...when I go to tighten the knobs, the little bastards wont stay in place and in general its just poorly made..."
1,Car smells like a dead animal now!,It took out the stain but now my car smells like an animal died in it! Horrific! I have left the windows down for 2 days and smell hasn't gotten any better. Avoid this product at all costs!
1,Do NOT Buy This Product!,"If you are thinking about purchasing this product, DON'T! I purchased this product, and used it as directed, when cleaning the seats of my car. This product made my car smell HORRIBLE... A disgusting combination of vomit and who knows what else. The smell not only lingered, but it intensified as the day went on. You will not only regret purchasing this product, but you will also find yourself spending way too much extra money, searching for a product that will undo the disgusting and nauseating damage that this product caused."
1,lazy work that does not attract kids for too long,"Our daughter soon lost interest in most of the songs compared to Baby Signing Time DVD. Of course music DVD and sign language DVD are different, but this product is such a scamped work that has randomly shot play scenes of the same children (overly caucasian) and repetitious animations that do not even match the lyrics. It's annoying that they feature same girls and boys that it makes me think they must be the sponcers' children. Many of the songs are not really for kids, and are sang by so-so singers. I find it nothing attractive about this product. I recommend Baby Signing Time DVDs (even if you are not into baby sign language) for their quality and baby-friendly, interactive original songs."
1,Crappy,"This is the worst dvd I ever bought. All the positive reviews must have been written by the makers of this dvd. First of all, this dvd was not at all engaging. Second, the music videos are just shots of children playing. Third, the main characters are (in plain language)crappy. Fourth, lyrics did not accompany the songs. Some songs are so fast that it was difficult to follow if you didn't know the lyrics. I knew most of the songs, but not my daughter. Aaaaghhhh, this dvd is so bad that I'm not going to spend any more time on this review. It's not worth it. I'm just going to make this short with one final statement: Buy at your own risk!"
1,Poor- not even close to other titles from Baby Genius,"I bought this title after the great experience with the ""Nursery Rhymes"" DVD. I have several unpleasant problems with this title:1. The quality of audio is very bad, it sounds like a home recording2. Images and scenes are average, not much effort has been put into them3. The accompanying Compact Disc turned out to be in SPANISH! (no mention on Amazon about this)4. Though my baby son is totally riveted when i put on the Nursery Rhymes DVD, he couldn't care less when this one is playing5. What songs are these anyway? the lyrics seem altered in a very weird way, for incomprehensible reasons"
1,"A reply to Gandeto's ultra-nationalist Yugo-Slavic myths: ""The Alleged Differences Between Macedonians and Other Ancient Greeks","I had to give a more comprehensive answer to the Yugoslav mythology presented by Mr. J. Grezlovski aka ""Gandeto"", than the space allowed here so I sat down to clear the nebulous clutter presented by the falsifiers of Macedonian history.It is unfortunately quite a bit longer than a brief review, but if you got suckered to pay money to buy Gandeto's propaganda pamphlet, you can now get some compensation by reading this one gratis from me:""The Alleged Differences Between Macedonians and Other Ancient Greeks""[...]"
1,Garbage--no color plates,This is a piece of junk. None of the color plates of the original book are included. Even the product review on Amazon talks about a Colour Chart on the frontispiece but there is no such chart in this edition. Don't get sucked in like I did.
1,Creepy and torture to read,"Oh my god, run! This was pure torture. If someone updated the language and took out all of the weird occult stuff, maybe it would be a short statment like, dude your thoughts turn into little things and take on a life of thier own. I think that if you read modern astral projection or energy healing texts, you would get a better understanding of thought forms. Personally I couldn't get into this, even for free. There is also something creepy about this book in general, I kept getting images of those old photos that they used to take of the dead children and family dressed up and sitting like they are still alive. I'm just saying..... if you want to feel like dead people are staring at you, read this book. Or go to the early bird buffet before 5 on a sunday..."
1,NO ILLUSTATIONS!! ALL 50 of them are missing!,"I saw this book in my friend's house and the illustrations were amazing. I went on Amazon and bought the book, anticipating reading it! I was so disappointed when it arrived and all the illustrations were missing, they provided only the text referring to the illustrations that were NOT there! I am returning it, very very disappointing."
3,badfinger drummer,"I am a completiest you could say when it comes to Badfinger, so I try to pickup up everything that is available. Mike is a very good drummer who also plays other instruments as well. This was the last Cd I needed to complete my collection on Mr. Gibbins. The music itself is not really Badfinger like at all. Its more a modern day not so heavy style of Rock & Roll. Now his singing is not really that good, but I can overlook alot that other reviewers may not. He put this & some of his other cds out on his own private label. I found him to be a humble honest human being, & above all else thats what matters the most to me."
1,Too Expensive to be this Bad,There was very little usable info on this tape. It would have been better if they had maybe shown close-ups of how he was twisting his attacker's hands.
5,Great pair of underwear,this style will easily become a favorite of mine when I want to wear briefs. The material is fantastic and extremely comfortable. I have since bought more.
3,Layer by Layer DVD,This arrived in a timely fashion. It is a gift. The recipient likes to make mixed media art projects and requested this on her Amazon gift list. The company that made the DVD is reliable and I expect it to perform or recipient will contact manufacturer or product contact.
5,Best Running Shoe by Far!,"If you've heard of Chi Running you will LOVE these shoes. They are so comfortable and have enough padding to run long road running or on trails. These shoes are very hard to find and I hope they keep making them. I've used them running in snow, on ice, everything... and they are GREAT!!!!"
4,Super Light,"If you are looking for something with a little less weight to it, these are the shoes for you. Extremely light and comfortable. Could use a bit more support at the arch, but all in all, an excellent all around work out shoe."
5,Beautiful and dreamy,"One of the editorial reviewers used the word ""gauzy"", which describes it well. Can be read and reread. A nice bed side book for house guests."
4,Great Music,The Best Gospel Songs ever is a great book for piano. It is difficult enough to challenge a newbie to piano like me yet easy enough for me to play. Great selection of songs also.
3,"Nice and light, but doesn't last","First off, let me state that I am a professional carpenter with over 25 years experience.I purchased this hammer in April, 2011 after rupturing a tendon in my right forearm. It is nice and light, and after taking a week off work it was the only hammer I could use with my bum arm. I prefer to use a lightweight hammer for framing as well as finish work, especially since most work is done with air nailers these days. The hammer worked fine-not so great for whacking joists and beams into place, but I knew that it wouldn't be and I keep a small sledge handy for that kind of work anyway. Fast forward to October 2012- the face of the hammer is significantly worn and rounded making it difficult to drive nails. Time for a replacement. I don't believe the high cost of this hammer is justified and I will be going back to a standard 16 oz hammer, which costs less than 30 bucks..."
3,disappointed,"Having used and liked my friend's Roget's 4th Edition Thesaurus, I wanted one of my own. But apparently, Roget's changed the format after the 4th Edition. Rather than get the latest Roget's (6th Edition?), which several buyers didn't like, I went for the Merriam-Webster. For one, it boasted over 60,000 more entries than Roget's. And, it was supposidely easier to use. Well, I've barely used it and I'm really disappointed. Several words I consider fairly common weren't even there! For example, look up ""anomaly"" in Roget's and you get 5 catagories, each with numerous word-choices. In Merriam-Webster ""anomaly"" isn't even there!! Neither is ""vested"". I'm sure there are dozens more. I wish I could return it, but it is 2-weeks past the 30-day limit."
1,Disappointed,"Being new to using a thesaurus, I bought this book in part because of its overall rating. The book was of no help with many of the words I looked up. Instead, I found Roget's Thesaurus to be much more useful and a wonderful tool."
2,Wasn't able to program remote,"Lost the original remote - and bought this as a replacement; however, the shop I took remote to was unable to program. I found the directions (which are downloadable on vendors site) a bit unclear, but you can be the judge. The remote appeared to work - lights active while buttons are pressed, but again - was never able to program correctly."
2,Disappointing,"I picked this book up to learn how to tie a couple of the more obscure climbing knots like the trident and triple bowline and to have fun with the rest. The book is well organized (except for the utterly useless directory of knots), and the diagrams are large. My gripe is that he skips steps, and magically produces extra slack halfway through a knot. There are cases where I have thrown the book down and had to figure it out by trial and error (not what I paid $20 for). Furthermore some of the methods he uses to tie knots (such as the butterfly) are flat out strange, or clumsy. When I'm up 100 feet and my life depends on it I need more efficiency."
3,It's ok,It is a handy book to have but som of the knots are not to easy to follow because the drawings seem to leave you hanging
2,Poor paper & print quality,"Warhol pioneered art that could be easily reproduced. This is a great example of where cutting too many corners, though, caused that to fail. The paper quality is poor. The print is blury because of a poor quality print job. The layout is unflattering to the work. The only redeeming factor is that the Warhol piece (as created by Warhol) is great. Look somewhere else for art prints. This is rubbish."
4,It's a Book 2,"While the first book set the for a great trilogy and the return of the way Dragonlance was but this like so many trilogys is just a book 2 meaning book 1 set the stage, told what probleoms the the characters would face, introduced new characters and so on but not much really happens until the last 150 pages the whole book just talks about what it builds up to in the end setting the stage for a great conculsion in vanished moon. Most of this story talks about The elven nations for about 3/4 of it that really gets boring after a while well not borning but monotonous. the other 1/4 of the book talks about the things that is more interseting like Palin, Dalamar, and Tas. Although i do tend to dog on this book it's still pretty darn good. THe only real probloem i had was an event in the beginning of the book where Caramon suddenly appears and then disapears and they never really explian how or why don't worry about this being a spoiler it happens on about page 40."
5,"DragonLance ""Saga""",This is an outstanding book - very easy read - I would recommend this book to my friends and family it's that good of a book
4,A Brit Ponders the Banks,"Anthony Bailey admired the Outer Banks from his native Britain, but was sorely disappointed upon first arrival. No bucolic, unspoiled nature spots, but strip malls, traffic jams and houses built to the ocean edge. But he gave the Banks a chance and over the next few weeks traveled from Corolla to Nag's Head to Ocracoke to Harker's Island. While doing so he gained an appreciation for the region's unique natural beauty, culture and history. Bailey effortlessly weaves nature writing and adventure with history and resident profiles to document the broad social trends affecting Outer Banks culture. Recommended for anyone with an interest in the area."
5,Adventure Medical Kits,"The Adventure Medical Kits has just the right amount of supplies to keep it light but functional, great value also"
5,Perfect.,This bag is exceptional. It fits two binders and books perfectly and it doesn't feel like it's going to tare or give out.
1,SMALL ENGINE REPAIR,This book is so out of date that I am going to send it back and get a refund. It is useless. Michael
3,Just average,This is a good book if you collect repair manuals but don't expect it to be your only reference. Much of it seems to be un-updated reprints from earlier editions - but this is just a guess. The section on Briggs abd Stratton small horsepower motors is very poor and excludes many variations. The overall quality of illustrations is very poor. I don't regret buying it and have found many useful tidbits in it BUT it is not a comprehensive repair guide for small engines less tha 20 horsepower as it is touted to be.
1,`small engine repair,One star as the book is outdated and was printed in 1994. This was my fault for not checking this first.
4,Humble Pie,"This album was a truly great surprise. It was recommended by a friend so I thought I would check it out. If you like Led Zep. with a little bit of Liz Phair thrown in you will definitely like this music. Good Wife is a finely crafted pop song with a little bit of an edge to it. Love Knot is a great kick off for the album and sets the tone nicely with edgy vocals and fuzzy guitars. The rest of the album continues to bridge the gap nicely between great pop and good ole blues based rock and roll. Her singing style is unique and her voice is a refreshing change from the overproduced, over animated, boringly polished singing style of alot of singers out there today. Check it out. You will be pleased."
3,Good to have in the collection...,"We dont use this DVD very often. My daughter likes it but she has other DVDs that she like more, we therefore pull it out for something different every now and again. Our favourites are:Baby Signing TimeGoodnight MoonYour baby Can ReadAnd a British DVD called Row Row Row your Boat"
4,My kids favorite,"My kids (9 months and 26 months) watch this video ALL the time. It is one of their favorites. With the combination of puppets, music, and children they seem to really enjoy it. And I appreciate that for most of the songs they did not change the original words. I have had a hard time finding DVDs and CDs with the original words and not a ""re-writing"" to suit the theme of the video.One problem though, these are not what I would consider Nursery Ryhmes, but children's songs. I was hoping for something with ""little jack horner,"" ""Sing a song of Sixpence"" ""Old King Cole"" etc. These are truly children's' songs."
3,Nice collection of nursery rhymes!,"My baby does enjoy this show, but seems more interested in a DVD that we just got ""Singing Babies Nursery Rhyme Time."" This DVD has the babies singing the nursery rhymes, which so captivates little Michael (age 7 months) that he watches these singing babies over and over again. We actually rotate between ""Baby Genius"" and ""Singing Babies."""
4,Makes great cookies...,"I love the pan for cookies, but that is all I have used it for. They slide right off; however, the pan is heavy and slightly awkward to handle when hot."
2,Made for a giant,"This is a solid flute, let me say that first, however there is little else good about it because of the placement of the finger holes.I am 6ft 3 and have average sized hands for my size, however, I can't cover the finger holes for this flute effectively at all. I don't see anybody being able to play this thing effectively except for a person with gigantic hands. If they can get past that part, it has a good sound, amazingly enough for a cheap flute, but it a massive obstacle that many will not be able to over come."
2,disappointed,"It was nice to hear the old songs that were a part of this group's presentations. However, the quality of the sound was not up to my expectations. Whatever was done to make this into a CD could have been done in a better way. I will be more careful about selecting remastered recordings in the future."
1,Trivial -- the McDonalds of Travel Literature,"This book takes what can be a great experience and McPilgrim's it . . . The writing is wooden, and the depth is about as thick as the meat on one of those teeny basic hamburgers. The only reason you would read this is to get a list of sites you may want to research elsewhere. For travel to sacred sites, see such well-written and inspiring books as Phil Cousineau's Art of Pilgrimage and Sarah York's Pilgrim Heart -- don't waste your money on this one."
2,tragic,"worth less than they sold for .50 cents, that would have been ok but they were 5.00 to deliver... save your money"
1,Absolute Garbage,"What a waste of money. While I was not expecting surgical grade, I was expecting it to tweeze (is that a word?). Instead the second I apply some force, all of them fold. Either these are as cheap as it gets, or I have developed super strength. I don't think it is me."
1,Absolute garbage!,These products are so light and flimsy that when they arrived each one was already bent and useless. Even if they had not been damaged the quality is so poor i do not beleive they could be used for any purpose. To add further insult thye have some sort of shiny plating that had flakes and cracks. I guarantee your disappointment if you buy this product.
2,Flimsy,"These tweezers are very flimsy and bend easily. All four needed to be bent so that the ends come together. I have not used them yet. I think they will be adequate for my needs, but I was disappointed."
2,You get what you pay for,"These might be worth it just because they're so cheap, but don't expect much in the way of quality. They're a little flimsy, definitely not up to the task of pulling out splinters or hairs."
3,Good for the price. Quality is ok.,I bought these tweezers because it is a set of 4 general use tweezers for a good price. They are not high quality tweezers for pulling small objects. they are good for holding small objects like on board leds and little electronics. thats what i got it for and they are not bad. BTW they are very easy to bend so choose wisely.
1,Crappy at best,"RIP OFF....these tweezers are basically paper thin metal bent in half. None of them tweeze!!!! they are all bent.. I WILL be sending them back. Not worth even $1.00....very displeased with this product . Don't waste your time or money.. Weak. Oh and the add says ""re useable pouch"" also BS , no pouch. Not cool"
1,move along and find something worth spending your money on,"This item is the epitomy of Chinese made cheap junk. Save your money. The seller did refund my money and I give them good marks for that. I could go in to great detail about why they are junk, Trust me when I tell you they are a TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!"
4,Insider Conversation,"Chatty and irresistable, rather than being the harsh polemic that the title might suggest, this volume is a multifaceted discussion of the issues involved in teaching and studying art in a studio environment. Anyone who has ever lived through a studio critique will find the book hard to put down. Like Elkin's earlier work, ""What Painting Is,"" it will make any art-student readers wish that they could study with him at the Art Institute of Chicago.Despite the provocative title, Elkins has very little interest in transforming arts education. Rather, he wants to point to both the virtues and the pitfalls of critique-based evaluation, and to get both teachers and students to appreciate just what a mysterious and irrational process it is to attempt to teach/learn the studio arts.The author is an insider speaking candidly for other insiders -- the audience for this valuable and intelligent essay may not be huge, but within that group, it will stimulate many electrifying conversations."
1,Shampoo and conditioner,"Would not buy this again, as it totally dries out my hair and makes it brittle. I really love John Frieda products, except this one."
5,Quick Intro To A Pit Bull,"This review will be short and to the point...I recently rescued a dog that is mostly Pit mixed with Chow Chow and Mastiff. This book was a great intro to the characteristics of Pit Bulls. I didn't know a whole lot about Pits, so this book was very helpful to me. If you are considering a Pit as a pet and have never had one and don't want to read a book the size of a dictionary...this is great!"
3,Not what I expected,"Campbell Hausfeld FP2048 OK for small things like bike tires and balls, but takes exceptionally long time to fill auto tires and simply not usefull for anything like a nail gun. Product quality just fine. Price on Amazon excellent.Make sure you understand the CFM capabilities before you buy. Next time I will buy a larger unit."
1,Wee Sing with No Music???,"I ordered two of these books for friends because my son loved it so much. But, when they came in the mail, we only recieved the paperbacks. How can ""Wee Sing"" with no music. When I bought it at the store it had a CD with it. What is going on here?"
2,Pan warps,"Although this pan is heavy, it warps during cooking. (It's flat when cool, but once placed in the oven, it makes a sharp noise within a few minutes as one corner of the pan bends upward). I like my pans to stay even throughout the cooking process. I wouldn't recommend this one."
5,Best Ball Ever!,I purchased one of these balls for my Koolie (Kelpie sixed working dog) and it has been the best ball for him. It smells minty and it floats! He uses it every day at the park chasing it on land and in water and squishing it up and down between his jaws as he's walking. It gets a workout! Two years later the only damage is that the continents have fallen off. The ball has no pieces out of it and still smells surprisingly good. :)
2,didn't even need it,I bought this for cheap and I thought I would use it in my class but it turns out that the teacher had the info online and it was easy to get a good grade without the book.
4,WCF12 and a Sharp Zaurus,"Reading a review about the WCF12 and a Zaurus 5500 from user on Amazon almost kept me from buying this device, but then I found a useful tidbit of information. As long as you have updated the Zaurus' ROM, the WCF12 will work right out of the box."
1,Doesn't work with my HP Jornada 548,"In spite of what the box says (Windows CE 3.0), it just doesn't work with my HP Jornada 548 PocketPC and Linksys doesn't even answer my emails!!! The install utility came back with a message saying that the device connected (Jornada 545) was not supported with the WCF12.I bought it and can't use it! :-("
3,"2 tries, finally works","Picked this card up and the first one would not work in infrastructure mode. Exchanged it and it worked perfectly. I use it with a Linksys befw11s4 access point. the wcf12's reception is decent, not great, and its power consumption seems pretty high. It works great with my 300Mhz Dell Axim X5. Once I got the working card setup was a breeze, even with 128bit WEP."
3,"nice thing, but not really usable","I have to agree that this is a nice card from outside to inside compare to its competiters.But, at the same time, current day's technology really [is not good], not linksys's fault. Three things killed all wireless CF card:1. They are battery killer, they are not just hungry for power, they are real killer! Every wireless cf card take at least 250mA, those power saving card REQUIRES advanced feature to support it on the AP side, which most home AP does not.2. They are still big and ugly. True that this linksys card is much better than the dlink 650, but it is still such an ugly thing extruding from my PDA ...3. Last, pocket IE [is not good] ...... you can not seriouly use it, although it IS fun to try it."
4,Pretty swift,"I'm using this card with my iPaq 3650 and SMC7004VWBR. Setup was pretty straightforward. The only problem is that the connection seems slow, but I think it's the iPaq not being able to render the web pages fast enough (need more CPU power). I'll have to try it on my laptop to see how fast it really is. I only wish the card didn't protrude this much out of the top of the iPaq and power consumption needs to come down (hence 4 start rating)."
4,Getting WEP to work,"This is to share my experiences getting this card to work on iPAQ 2210 under Windows Mobile 2003 with 128bit WEB encryption.As was mentioned a number of times the default drivers that come with the card do not work. Get the new ones from Linksys. All these new ones do is enable the default Windows driver.Now comes the fun part. How do you get it to run 128 bit encryption. The configuration window looks like the Windows drivers were designed only for 64bit, this confused me for a while. Ignore the look though, just enter your 128bit key even though it looks like the ""Network key"" text box is too small to accept it and it should work. Seems obvious but took me a while to get to it. Linksys tech support did not know how to deal with this."
1,really very bad,"Cute chihuahua on the cover, but this is a really bad ""spanish language"" DVD. They use terrible pronunciation that you don't want your children to learn, spoken by children AND adults who obviously DO NOT speak spanish (not even as a second language). There are mistakes in gender (""el hamburguesa"" is one example) and there are glaring mistakes in phrasing that no fluent spanish speaker would use (not in Mexico, not in South America, not in Spain.. nowhere). If this had been edited by a linguist, or at least a real fluent spanish speaker, these problems might have been corrected. They were not. Music CDs in spanish with an accompanying book with lyrics are better, and reading books written in spanish with your child is very good. But don't waste your money on this DVD. I'm still searching for good teaching aids, and might have to spend the big bucks on a Berlitz cd/dvd (if they have a series for children). I'm sorry I wasted my time and money on this one."
4,Home Life in Grandma's Day,"I enjoy the concept of the ""In Grandma's Day"" series. By looking at the childhood of real people born in the 1930'2 and early '40's, history takes on more meaning for children. The photographs for the most part are accurate and interesting. I do have concern with one photo in this book. According to the text, the Afro-American family in this book only had a wood-burning stove, yet one of the photos shows a girl at an electric stove. Despite this mistake, readers will be surprised at the life of a black family in the 1930' s and 1940's. Geneva talks about her community with love. Her parents had to work hard to make a living and she and her sister were expected to work hard cleaning and cooking at home. Church was an important part of their family life. Movies were much more fun though for the kids. Of the four books I've seen in this series, this is the only book about growing up in a minority race."
5,Ergonomics on the 618 are tops,"From the moment you pick up the 618, you feel the perfectly shaped handles and notice the routers light weight. It edge-profiles like a dream. This is my go to router for rabbeting, chamfering, and dovetailing. I have also had great results cutting hinge mortises. I bought the kit mostly for the fixed base, but I find myself using the plunge base frequently as well.Power is ample.Ergonomics and control make this router shine.This router accepts standard Porter Cable style guide bushings - a feature that is important to me. I use these bushings for cutting dovetails with a jig, and making signs.I have achieved accurate results with all projects. This is a tool capable of fine woodworking. And it works great for general construction as well.Great router!"
1,rate it really no stars,"I bought a Dewalt dw618 router with the case and three bases. It looked like a great router, but it started making sounds like parts flying around inside the router, then black smoke came out the air vents, then a flame and it sounded like it exploded. It was cutting a pine board. I was babied and had only used it 45 min total. Dewalts service center said 2 weeks till they could get to working on it. Need an authorized receipt of purchase, or 129.00 to fix it. guranteed tough - yes if you are willing to keep buying new ones. manager wanted to know if it was used in a router table? he suggested 45 minutes use sounded a bit extream. yes really tough. nothing but road blocks to getting service. ***DO Not Buy One *** disappointed in Dewalt PS don't buy a dewalt router!"
5,Wonderful Item,"I don't know what people expect when they buy this item, but for me, it was to keep addresses, phone numbers and download my outlook calendar. If that is all you expect, then this is perfect. For those people who live and die by the palm gadgets, then get yourself one of those expensive palms. Zire is cheap and convenient enough to take it anywhere you want and you don't get upset when you bang it around a bit. I had it for about a year and zero complaints. Also, the battery lasts extremely long for my purpose. So, if you are a simple guy like me, then this is perfect for you. If you are expecting a small computer, then you need to spend some money. Hope this helps."
2,NO BACKLIGHT!!!!,"Until you use it, you won't understand how incredibly annoying not having a backlit display is, especially with the text being so small on it. Not worth it, I returned mine after a few days."
3,Pay more money for something better...,"This palm is best for people that don't plan to use it much. For those of you who live by your palm, invest in something better. Those 2MBs will not be enough, and the fact that it does NOT come with a backlight makes this palm pilot NOT worth the money you spend on it. It looks cute, but it doesn't serve its purpose very well."
3,Not stable,"I wouldnt want to take awak positives from the Palm Zire. it is a preety good peice but then mine crashed for no reason(4 months later).Sadly enough I bought my peice from Amazon.com. What sucks big time is the fact that Palm doesnot come with a warranty period. They asked me to repair it which would cost a cool 75$ when i could get a brand new one off the shelf for the same price.As long as I had it, it works fine. Its a good recommendation for someone who wants to own their first pda. For a serious user, you better look at something that has a lot more features,a.more memory spaceb.color( though it is not a requirement)c. more functionality( compact flash, SD memory)"
1,Zire Palm Review,"I do not recommend this product. This is my second Zire, the first one I had less than a month, so I could exchange it. When I tapped the stylus, it would not respond or it would bring up the wrong item...very frustrating. I have had this Zire about 4 months (not returnable) and the same thing is happening. I also would like it back-lit, it's hard to read in dim light. I am very very angry, I had gotten it to replace my address/appointment book. Save your money."
1,DANGEROUS IF LEFT PLUGGED IN WHILE AWAY,iN LESS THAN 6 MONTHS FROM PURCHAS STARTED TICKING SOUND AND DIGITAL WENT TO 8S AND THEN SMELLED BURNING WIRES. I FEAR IF NOT HOME WOULD HAVE BURNED DOWN HOUSE. GOOD IRON BEFORE INCIDENT
3,Good quality dvd and service,The dvd arrived on time and in good condition. The quality of the dvd was good as promised. I'd recommend purchasing this dvd from this vendor.
2,Legend of the Lost,"Although I am a dedicated fan of John Wayne and dearly love his movies, I found this movie, which I have never seen before, to be slow and for lack of a better word boring. I will view it again and add it to my collection because John Wayne is in it."
1,Legend of the Lost,Some of the dialog was hard to understand. The movie dragged on and on and was boring - nearly fell asleep.
5,"The Best ""Miami"" Season Yet!","I just finished watching the third season of ""CSI Miami"" and I have to say, it's definitely the best best season so far for this show. There is a major plot twist this season that will blow your mind! Forget everything you think you know about these characters, because they're about to take you for a wild ride!"
5,Plain Truth,I've been a fan of CSI Miami for many many years. I think all the actors are fantastic. Anyone who purchases this product will enjoy an evening of great entertainment.
3,....my 2nd time through...,"Because of the use I put into this book, I had to order another since my original is in such dire straits! VERY informative and helps to give you a different outloook on what Yoga is all about. It's MUCH more than fitness...."
5,If I could have only one yoga book this would be it.,"If you want to know all the important yoga asana and have photographs and descriptions of them all, this is it. I would suggest you buy this book and memorize it. Mr Iyengar is a master of his art and even though this book is now quite old and the illustrations would be considered weak by modern standards, this is the one. There is nothing to beat it. I am not unbiased here. I am a certified teacher, but you did ask to see my opinion!"
4,Great for beginners and those who wish to push the limit!,This book is perfect for the beginner and experienced yoga student. Each position is clearly exlained along with the benefits of each position.
1,Not happy,"This item appears to be a knock off or at the very least, a factory second. The surface finish is poor and actually had rust showing upon arrival. Le Creuset is spelled backwards on the handle and the there is no manufacturer's stamp on the bottom of the pan. I would have returned it immediatly but my husband disposed of the packaging before I could send it back."
5,One of the greatest Westerns ever made.,"I am a fan of realistic westerns that let you identify with the Old West and the lives of the people who stuggled to make it their home. This is one of those.In many westerns the story line doesn't ring true or seem plausible. The setting, props, etc. are not reflective of the time line of the story.This is one of the few movies that sets the standard for western movies. Others would include High Noon, The Searchers, and the original Monte Walsh. Lonesome Dove comes close.A great story, whether set in the West or not."
1,Major allergic reaction,I have sensitive skin and I broke out all over my face after using this product. I don't recommend it.
3,sunscreen for sensitive face,"This product is not odorless, but does not smell bad. Suggest Olay Complete Defense spf 30 for sensitive skin instead."
4,"Big cats, big cats, everywhere big cats","If you're a die hard fan of panthera XXX (fill in the blank as you wish, you'd be correct), this movie is for you. Hordes of lions, male and female, tigers and leopards are constantly milling/leaping/roaring/ around all corners of the set almost literally from start to finish. An inordinate amount of human/animal interaction should keep those who derives great pleasure from seeing big cats acting docile and manageable around human beings very happy. Do not expect a robust story line or inspiring acting. That can't be what you buy this DVD for these days, anyway unless you're a Melanie Griffith worshipper. A very young version of the actress is featured in the movie. In short, treat this as a big cat documentary, not a movie."
4,Nice Looking Tea Cups,"I really like the look and feel of these tea cups.The 6 oz size is just right.The box says ""Satin exterior finish stays cool while glossy interior keeps beverages warm"". Unfortunately this is not the case. If your beverage is quite hot the cup will become too hot to hold. This is not a problem for me because I use these for green tea with water temperature well below boiling but it's something you should be aware of when deciding whether or not these are right for you."
3,Too small,Too small cups. Smaller then expected.Can't understand that freaking american units i.e. ounce.
5,Laid back and relaxing!,I pop this CD into my car's player whenever we are heading to the beach. Extremely relaxing music that gets me in the mood for a true Trini-style lime!
3,Runs REALLY Hot!!,"Maybe this is normal for a charger cord, I don't know, but this one runs REALLY hot. The cord is hot and the shaver is hot. Not too hot to pick up, but almost and it feels like something is going to burn out quickly somewhere. Could be it's a defective cord. If the vendor is reading this, please comment."
2,Arrogant tone obscures probably useful information,"When my doctor diagnosed my hypothyroidism, my wife bought me this and another book on thyroid disease to help me understand what was happening to me. The authors write with an annoying lack of humility -- the text seemed to be as much about these doctors' superior knowledge as about thyroid disease itself. I was put off by this arrogant tone and did not finish the book. The other book, _The Thyroid Solution_ by Ridha Arem, is a much better choice."
3,"Solved: The Riddle of Illness by Stephen E. Langer, James F. Scheer","I give it a three because I had to think about which book it was....Informative, useful, a book for layman and professionals....worth the read."
3,Pretty violent,"My children begged me to buy these DVD's after seeing previews for the show, but the previews never indicated just how violent they would be!The animation is darling--bright colors and charming character images--but I'm afraid they're too violent for their intended age group to earn the full five stars from me."
5,"Must have, just in case","Bought this unit because like so many two story homes... all the bedrooms are upstairs. That leaves all possible fire points like stove, furnace, hot water heater, etc. below us. A ground floor fire and your trapped. Unit in every bedroom upstairs is a must. Overall construction seems good and it fits under the bed. Instructions are explicit. Practice drills a few times recommended as the hardest part is getting out the bedroom window. Unit design fits window sill well and stand off legs add to surefootedness."
5,nin never lets me down,"i saw nine inch nails live in cincinnati during this tour and it was one of the most entertaining and exciting concerts i've ever been to. besides the quality of the music being the best, the lights, videos and stage show were amazing."
5,Rob Sheridan for President,"You should, upon purchase of this dvd, sufficiently prepare to be blown away. I got to see NIN twice during the ""with teeth"" circuit (once on the rail in front of the inestimable Aaron North) and it was a rapturous experience. NIN kills it live and this incarnation of the band has the chops - even if you didn't like ""with teeth"" (and shame on you for that) you should buy it for ""wish"" alone."
5,NIN have never looked/sounded better,"Wow. I'll say it again...WOW! This is a MUST HAVE for anyone that's even remotely close to being a NIN fan. Great visuals, superb audio...I will be watching this this over and over. Trent is incredible, the light show is incredible, the energy is incredible...and the set list is nearly perfect. What a great Blu-ray. I can only hope that there will be a Year Zero Blu-ray like this, as I believe it ranks up there with ANY of Trent's work. The man is one talented musician, no doubt about that."
4,A very nice HD disc,This band kicks in HD. I can't believe how great it looks. Trent looks buff and this video makes him looks amazing. The camera angles are just beautiful.
3,"When it works, it works fine -- when it works","When it works, this USB wireless adapter is very nice. The main problem that I've had is that it does not make a tight connection with the USB port, and I've tried several different USB ports that other devices work with just fine. When the connection is not perfectly snug, the wireless connection is lost. Also, the installation, software and drivers are not intuitive. Nonetheless, it's still a nifty device, most of the time."
4,D-Link make it pretty easy to get a wireless network up-and-running,"The G-122 works like a dream with Vista once you can find the driver at the D-Link site. Vista sorts out all the configuration for you.Also works well with Windows 2000 but you have to configure it using a utility, which is not that intuitive to use - required a visit to D-link support site to figure out how to set up a secured network.Didn't work on my Windows ME PC when the wireless network was secured but did work when it was unsecured.Had to change my router to channel 11 to avoid interference from my 2.4GHz Panasonic cordless phone.Altogether a pretty good product for D-Link."
3,worked but did not last long,"This item actually works OK. WPA-PSK worked OK for me (with DI-624 router). The problem lies in the construction of this adapter. Mine broken after a few month of use. If you use it often on your laptop, the wires within the adapter can snap fairly quickly. I had to have mine soldered back on, but it is now broken again. I recommend that you either get a different one, or make sure using the USB dangle every time...FYI, I bought mine from Fry's for about FIVE bucks after rebates..."
4,Good little device,"I picked this up for $20 after rebates at Circuit City. Worked very well under WinXP paired with my WRT54G router. Good range, steady signal."
4,Mac users beware,"I use this with an iMac. It does not come with drivers for Mac OS X, nor does D-Link offer any help. They refuse to admit it will work with Macs. I was pointed toward a driver made available at [...]. I remember having trouble getting it to work, but once it was working it has worked well and consistently. The iMac connects to an AEBS a couple rooms away through the D-Link."
2,Already Broken,Not even 6 months and the little USB adaptor has pooped out. All that happens when i plug it into the computer is a USB device malfunction message. My suggestion: Buy cheap and you get just what you pay for.
5,Better Than The Wiggles!,"The Wiggles N Tunes CD's were recommended to me by a local music store as a gift for my 4 year old, and she loves it - even more than the Wiggles TV show, which appears to be more focused on merchandising than teaching."
2,Looks better online,"I thought this would be a good tool to hold the things I buy like groceries but when I opened it, too small I had to send it back. Cant believe it cost that much for its small size."
2,Not Satisfied,"The CD I recieved, which indicated it was Used - Good Condition was damaged and would get stuck on Song 5. I emailed the supplier with this information, requesting either a replacement or a refund. After not hearing anything from anyone for a while, I emailed them again. I got a reply that they had shipped a replacement on February 15th and to please be patient. It's now March 22 and I still haven't recieved the replacement. Not very good customer service that I'm sure we're all used to.As for the CD Songs 1 - 4 are pretty good!"
1,Two units malfunctioned,"I ordered the original item, used it for about a week, then sent it to my son in New Hampshire. He used it less than fifteen minutes and it locked up, never to function properly again. I ordered a replacement, checked it out and sent it on to him, with the same result -- less than 15 minutes of use, it quit working.I thought the unit was nice, compact and fairly easy to use, but with two malfunctions in two cameras, I don't think I would recommend this Aiptek model to anyone."
1,this is a scam,"I guess I misread the description, but I thought I was ordering a dozen childrens ""magic gloves"" for $5.63but this was actually 1 pair of little knit gloves for this price. I did get a return authorization, buthad the expense to return them also.I guess I will read descriptions more carfully next time"
3,ex suicidal members 3rd try-/not thier best but their last!,"2 of these guys record ST 1st cd but they have had a hard time trying to cut a musical career out for themselves since! they did a very good debut with say uncle very crossover(dri,mod,coc)like but then they spent several years till they released will work for food and that cd was very speed metal styled but still not very impressive but decent then this? when god dies was nothing new or original.I think the first 2 cds are better than this especially say uncle was very underated"
5,Garmin Portable Friction Mount,Provides an alternative to sticking your Garnin GPS on the front window (mine occasionally falls off). Sits well on the dash (even if not perfectly flat) and doesn't slide about when cornering. Easily attaches to Garmin unit and easier to uninstall than window mount for better security. Performs as you would expect.
5,Great Price,"The Garmin Portable Friction Mount is a great price through Amazon. It is exactly as described, works really well on the dashboard to keep my GPS in place. The packaging was easy to open and the appropriate size for the product. Once again Amazon comes through."
4,Does the Job,Does a good job in holding the GPS and certainly preferable to a permanently attached mount. It is a bit bulky to store when not in use however.
5,mount,This is the best item for use with the Garmin it is so easy to use and you don't have to even think about what you want to do just put the Garmin on the mount and it is ready to use. Excellent item
2,I don't like it,Set up was easy. I went to re-position the base and it came apart.The 4 tiny screws flew every where and I lost 2 of them.
5,garmin portable friction mount,I've only used this mount a couple of times so far but am extremly happy with product so far. I put it on the left side of the dash in my Prius where it is out of the way and doesn't block my view. So far it has stayed in place and doesn't move. I can put the mount with garmin 1490t attached in the center counsole to keep out of sight when car is parked. No rings on windshield from windshield mount (dead giveaway to thieves) and don't have to keep taking off and putting on windshield mount. Would buy again from retailer who delivered when promised.
5,I love this!,I really like the way this sits on my dash & doesn't obstruct my view while I'm driving. My GPS fits well & I'm able to see my directions clearly.
3,Waaaaay better than the suction cup mount.,"I was really excited to purhcase this mount for my GPS, as the suction cup mount I had was always falling off the windshield. But, the friction mount didn't live up to my expectations. This mount protects my GPS from wear and tear much better than the suction cup, but it does not provide much 'friction' for a friction mount. My dash is molded plastic, and I drive on gravel roads quite a bit. The whole system tends to slide around on the dash, but I'd take this system over a falling GPS any day. I'm considering a small piece of duct tape on the underside of this mount system for max stabilization."
5,works great,This is the best invention for the garmin I have ever used. Stays in position and can be moved from car to car easily
3,Good product,Versatile mount with only reason for not giving it a 5 star being the fact that in our cold climate it gets very stiff and possibly slippery allowing for movement. That said it is a well constructed product and should perform well for the majority of time
5,Garmin Friction Mount,"The Garmin friction dashboard mount is wonderful. My nuvi gps sits securely on the dashboard when the mount is in use, and stores out of sight when not in use."
4,Garmin Portable Friction Mount,This mount holds well on any dashboard I have tried it on. The Garmin is fully adjustable for viewing when on the mount.
5,Works great!,It really works great. Just put it on your dash board and attach the GPS. It stayed on the dash and didn't move. Easy to read the GPS.Glad I bought it.
4,Great Stand,This is a great dashboard mount with quick release. The only drawback is the difficult to reach disconnect for the DC plug.
5,does what it says well,"Some windsheilds just won't hold the Garmin included rubber suction thingy. On 2 of our cars it holds fine all the time, but on a friends car where the windsheild it just shaped different it always falls down after a while no matter what we try. So we bought this just to be safe and it holds the GPS well in place and I think I like it better than connecting it to the windsheild, taking it on and off for easier access to typing in multiple destinations is better. Also note if you like to make quick or wide turns this thing is heavy and designed well enough it always stays in place."
4,Garmin Friction Dashboard mount,Good product; the Garmin I own snaps off and on really easy. It is easy to put on my dash and doesn't slide. The only challenge I have is plugging in the power chord; it is a little tight.
5,Very well designed.,"This is a very well designed base. Don't let the atypical shaped base puzzle you - this is well designed to grip your dash. The framing brace that grips the actual GPS permits incremental adjustments upwards or sideways for optimum viewing. The base stays put and looks good on my dash. Never had an incident of it sliding - ever.Nicely made. I also saw these bases being used at a rental car company in California, they were atop their customer counter and were being accessed when providing driving instructions to customers. All works nicely."
4,California legal,"The Garmin Friction Mount allows a GPS unit to be placed anywhere on the dashboard without violating rules against attaching objects to the windshield, as prohibited in California. As a bonus, Amazon's price is half that of certain retailers!"
5,best mount I've found so far,"Tried 3 different suction cup types, all were fair to poor, this one actually works well, I'd recommend it highly.....a VERY quick (i.e. panic) stop will dislodge it, but it's great 99% of the time"
5,Really adds to the Nuvi's usability,Highly recommend that Nuvi buyers purchase one of these at the same time. It makes the Nuvi easier to move from car-to-car and prevents possible damage to your Nuvi as a result of the standard suction cup mount falling off.
1,no good,I purchased a garmin nuvi from Costco. I purchased the bean bag holder from Amazon. These were gifts and my niece didn't get to try to use the beanbag until after the Amazon returndate. The ball on the beanbag is too large to fit into the socket on the nuvi so is unusable. I'm going to try to get Amazon to give me a replacement ball.
5,excellent alternative to glue on dashboard,In California it is illegal to glue anything to the windshield so this mount is excellent. Even if I could glue the factory included mount to the dash board I still prefer this because I can move it to other cars.
4,Garmin Portable dashboard mount for Nuvi series GPS Naviators,I have not had time to use this product although it appears to be just what I wanted.
1,Where is my Product?,"It's been 2 weeks and I haven't received my product. I ordered on July 2, 2010 and Beach Camera gave me a delivery estimation date between July 9, 2010 - July 14, 2010. Today is July 15 and there is no sign of my product. They already took more than usual shipping/delivery time on Amazon and yet they couldn't meet their latest delivery date. And this sucks even more when I haven't received any reply from them to my question regarding the shipping status. I sent a 2nd email and yet no response back from them."
2,Hold well but kinks cable,"I bought this for my Nuvi 680. It does stay where you put it. But it does put a tight bend radius in the cable. My advice is use it without the power cable that came with the unit or plug in the USB cable in the side of the unit to power it. The price of a replacement cable for the Nuvi 680 is over $200, if you buy the OEM one with the radio receiver built in. I have no idea how long your cable will last with such a tight bend radius but I anm not taking any chances. Truly a poor design."
1,Don't buy this for the Garmin 1490LMT model,"We brought the Garmin 1490LMT model and this mount at the same time but it just simplify DOES NOT fit the Garmin. Yes we should have read the fine print (keep scrolling to the bottom of the page) which only says its compatible with the 1490T model but we saw the 'suggested' purchases with the Garmin 1490LMT item to be this mount. Why suggest something Amazon if it doesn't fit? Given the cost of the item though, we decided not to return the item and now stuck with a not fit for purpose mount. We can't find a similar type mount either to fit this model which is a real shame as we love this item when we rented a car with it."
3,Not too bad.,"So far so good, I have absolutely no complaints yet. Haven't used it for a long time. Approximately 2 months."
5,Garmin Dashboard Mount,Works perfectly. GPS does not move or slide at all. Can be moved around inside the car easily. Leaves no marks on dash or windshild. Great for theft deterent.
5,Garmin dashboard mount flawless,"recently used the Garmin dashboard mount on our trip to Myrtle Beach. Since I am a law enforcement officer I know what thieves are looking for. With the Garmin dashboard mount you can easily take the bag off your dashboard and place it under your seat. It is such an advantage over the window mount. Many times people have their GPS's stolen because they have the mount stuck to their window, even though the GPS is not connected, thieves are smart enough to see this and realize that the GPS is probrably in the car somewhere. The dashboard bag, as I call it is easily accecable and does not slide or move when driving, you can easily move it around and adjust it. the GPS mounts to it and disconnects very easily. I love this product."
3,Garmin Portable Friction Mount,"I have one of these for my own GPS (Garmin 1350) and absolutely love everything about it. Therefore, I ordered one as a gift for my sister. The description specifically says that it's compatible with her Garmin GPS (Model 350), but that is totally false; it cannot be used with that model at all, so the gift was useless and a total waste of my money. Thus, I am upset about the product description, which amounts to false advertising, but if you have the right GPS, this is a terrific product."
5,Great product,This is a great product and not expensive either. I've put it on the dash board and used it for my Garmin GPS and it's terrific. Stays in the same place and won't move an inch no matter how sharp turns I make or how much I step on the breaks. Would definitely recommend!
5,"Excellent, Very Stable",Read all the reviews and did my own research before purchasing. Very happy with it. Yesterday I had someone run a red light and I had to slam on my brakes and swerve to keep them from hitting me....the gps mount never budged!! Everything else I own was on the floor but my gps was safe and sound.
3,needs to be more a little more tacky,"The concept of the friction mount is great. Enabling you to place your GPS on angled and irregular surfaces of the upper dash. But I find it moves around a lot. It is just not quite flexible or tacky enough to really stay put. I'm not switching to another mount, but this one could be improved. I do have mine on the far left of the dash near the A pillar, and the slip angle is just too much. It would not take much to fix this, so you really could use it on any area of the dash."
5,great little mount for nuvis,allows ease of change out from different vehicles and sticks to the dash or what ever like glue. not affected by cold temps and doesn't leave a suction cup ring on window!
5,Garmin Nuvi Portable Friction Mount,"This is an essential accessory for the Garmin GPS units. It permits you to place your GPS anywhere on the dashboard and easily move it wherever you wish. When you park your car, just place it under the car seat, and there is no GPS base mount visible to potential thieves."
3,A Little Velcro Helps,"This is my second Garmin GPS and mount. The GPS is great but watch out for the mount. My first one flew off the dashboard so many times, the old GPS couldn't take an address although it worked in all other respects.A self stick square of Velcro on the dashboard and the bottom of the mount is all it took to never have this happen again. I should have done it a lot sooner and I'd still be using my 2004 GPS now."
5,I Love This Mount!,"I really Love this mount!! Not only is it quick and simple to set up, but it actually works, and well I might add. It will fit on practically any dash without movement while driving, and stores nicely in the bottom of the optional Garmin gps bag."
5,Great product,"I was in need of a mount for my GPS that was stable and portable, the Garmin Portable Friction Mount has been the perfect choice. If you are tired of your unit falling off the mount because of loss of suction you need the friction mount. I give this product two thumbs up."
4,great product,"This works well in my van, which has a curved dash. Probably not crash worthy, but what is?"
3,Not for every GPS,"I bought this for very less price but it is not compatible for my GPS, so i cannot really say if can handle any GPS. What I can tell is that, it is very stable and stands still even when extreme turns are made."
5,Great experience,good product with comfortable use. it much more convenient than using fixed GPS holder and like it a lot......always use this now
5,Handy item,"The mount stays on my dashboard securely. The only time it slides is when I am on extremely rough roads. I like not having anything attached to my windshield. Plus, when I park the car somewhere I can easily put it out of sight so a would-be thief doesn't think there is a GPS unit in the car somewhere and break in."
5,Very functional.,"Works as advertised. Good craftsmanship. This allows portability of GPS unit to the floor to be 'out of sight' when leaving the car. This is important if you have a convertible, as thieves will steal it if they see it! This Friction Mount is stable and allows me to hide the Mount and the GPS when I leave the car. Good product. Good service! Recommended."
5,No question,Suction cups get un-stuck and fall off. This is by far the best way to mount your Nuvi. Dashboard shape makes a difference.
1,So disappointed.,"Well, I can't really review this product as all the accessories were mailed to me prior to the actual GPS. I can't really say how this item works because I have nothing to place into it.My order was placed in August and I have yet to receive it. What a disappointment and an inconvenience. If you want a product quickly from Amazon, I'd think twice if I were you. I have several trips planned and no GPS to assist me. I just can't understand why they offer a product that they apparently do not have in stock. I'll look elsewhere when considering my future purchases... and you should to."
1,Save your money,"I got this unit because I did nto want to stick anything on to my windshield. Well two turns and I stop, my unti was attached to the window and this thing was some place in the back of my car!!!!"
5,Great product!,"This works perfectly on my 2010 Altima's ""wavy"" dashboard. My sister and brother-in-law were so intrigued by it that I sent one to them for their Honda Element. Now they love it too!"
5,Garmin Portable Car Mount,"I love my Garmin Portable Friction Car Mount. It's very stable on the dash board even when taking a turn. My old set up was very unstable and I had to hold my Garmin in my hand or put it on the seat, otherwise it would topple over from the dash board. I'm very glad I bought it, especially for long trips."
1,Garmin portable friction mount,I felt that the mount that came with the Garmin would not work so I ordered this friction mount. The mount window mount came that came with the system worked well. I returned the mount unopened to Amazon.
5,This mount works great!,I was afraid it would slide around my dash but it stays put. The Garmin GPS fits it perfectly and it is such a great mound that I bought one for my parents as well when I have them a Garmin GPS for Christmas.
4,Good mount for Garmin with one warning.,"This is perfect for moving your GPS between multiple cars, but be careful where you place it on the dash. I set mine over the defroster vent and hit a huge pothole. The GPS bounced cracking the defroster panel. Make sure to place this over solid panels and you'll have no problems."
5,Garmin friction mount,I bought this mount when I bought the Garmin 255. The first time I used it - it was sitting on the dash - I had to make an emergency stop. The mount and GPS did not move! Easy to put up and take down and works equally well in the truck or car.
5,Dashboard mount holds your Nuvi in the right place,"The mount is very portable, lightweight, and keeps your Nuvi just where you want it on any dash."
5,Usefull,It is very useful mount. It is:- easy to install- easy to hide your navigation- stabile when you break- firm
3,Portable Garmin Mount,"the GPS stays on the dash fairly well. Far superior to the one that stuck on to the window. Heat, moisture, cold knocked it of the window."
5,Best...,"I didnt want to use the traditional suction cup on my windshield. I live in an extremely hot country. And several other people that use the suction cup with their GPS, it falls all the time... So i tried a different route. AND I LOVE IT. It stays in place, doesnt move at all, and i've been on some bumpy country roads... I wouldnt use anything else."
5,No hassle simple mount that works,"I have had difficulty finding a mount that works well in a mini cooper. The surface is curved, and the faux leather does not play well with stick-ons. This heavy mount works really well. The undercover material provides good friction with the dash, and the weight keeps it from falling over. I can move it around easily while driving, and it sits still for aggressive cornering. Only the most crazy steep hills, or high-g curves will budge it, but it is a rare occasion. I have tried many mounts, and this is by far the best and hassle free."
5,A good solid mount,"I had the same problem as many other people that the windshield mount constantly fell off while driving, creating safety hazard. Now I feel a lot more comfortable with this friction mount. It stays where it is and now I can focus on the road instead of trying to catch the falling GPS....."
5,Bean bag holder,Our Garmin came with the windshield suction holder. This was in our way so we wanted a bean bag type that was easier to move around. This one is great. You can sit it almost anywhere.
5,Ruslan,"Item received in time, works excellent as it should. Will definitely order from this vendor next time. I am glad to own this item."
2,Not on all dashboards,If you are going to use this; be sure not to use a dash cleaner/polisher; be prepared to catch your Garmin and warn your front seat passenger too; and put it on the seat or between seat console for safety' sake.
3,Heads Up,"This is a good product, BUT, make sure your dash has a large, flat space to support this item."
2,You people must have flatter dashboards than mine!,"Um...well, on the strength of all these reviewers who LOVE the Garmin beanbag, I ordered one with my new 855.Mistake.It may work fine for law-abiding citizens, but the slightly sloping dash of my BMW roadster, combined with any abrupt acceleration, sends the darn thing flying! I have had it one day, and have retrieved it at least three times.I am thinking of returning it to Amazon, if I can get them to take it back without the original packaging; the @#$%! blister pack was enthusiastically destroyed in my efforts to get this thing out of that infernal plastic. Evidently the fiends who used to package CDs have now been employed by Garmin.Since I am currently on a cross-country trip, I will try to make this thing work, perhaps with gaffer's tape. But that sort of defeats the purpose, doesn't it?"
5,Just what I needed,"This product is awesome. I searched online for something awhile back and didn't find it. Then, I recently came across it on another site and went to Amazon, where I knew the price would be better. The mounts that came with my Garmin Nuvi did not work for me. The dashboard mount did not stick well on my car's curvy dashboard. The windshield mount was on a bad slant for viewing, not to mention a distraction while driving. This mount sits wherever you want it on the dashboard and does not move. It's amazing. It's also easy to hide if you park where you don't want to disclose having a GPS. Sometimes I store the GPS in my case (also purchased from Amazon) and throw in my purse; other times, I just move the mount and GPS to the floor where nobody will see it. I made my decision to purchase based on other positive reviews, so I wanted to share mine for anyone undecided. For me, it was worth every penny."
5,Amazon verified purchase,"This portable bean bag mount is very handy. It stays where you put it, without anything permanent on the dash."
5,Happy with the purchase,The friction mount works great for me. Especially with a windshield that's not configured for attachments in a practical way. This mount goes anywhere you want it and stays in place. Highly recommend it.
4,Works great,The friction dash mount works great. It's grippy on most if not all surfaces and keeps your device where you need it. I haven't driven a slalom with these so I'm not sure if it'll stick around during a track event. :pMy only wish was that it would get a bit smaller to easier stow away somewhere unnoticed by thieves.
5,Nuvi dashboard mount,Great product. Heavy and stays put on dash. Never have tried a suction cup mount for comparison. Would recommend this.
5,GARMIN NUVI FRICTION MOUNT,"I purchased the Garmin Nuvi friction dashboard mount . The dimensions are really 7""x 8"" not what the description says. 12.3 x 9 something.I'm so glad because it's not bulky and sits just right on the dash of my new Ford Edge. I would not have liked it if it was larger. It would have been too large.I lucked out....."
4,Garmin friction dashboard pad,"I'm pleased with this -it does not slide around on the dash.I have noticed that you see the GPS unit take every bump (when the car hits bumps) vs. when it was stuck to corner of windshield.I decided to purchase a gymbag to carry this thing and GPS unit in- in order to hide it out of sight when not in use.I also keep the little bracket on the back of the unit attached to the GPS unit. The ease that this snaps on is great but this thing has detached at times unfortunately when I was doing some manuever(moving around) inside the car.I also will put this thing on the seat if there's no passanger and found that GPS will work if on the seat & away from nosey people in town,etc. I rate this thing as good."
5,A must-have accessory; perfect for my Garmin nüvi 1450LMT,"I never liked trying to stick my Tom-Tom on the windscreen, mainly because it didn't work, and holding the GPS while driving is a pain. So, after the Tom-Tom died, I ordered the Garmin Portable Friction Mount along with my new Garmin nüvi 1450LMT. Wow! This accessory perfect!I wedge the mount on the ledge above the dashboard between the left of the steering wheel and the driver-side door. The ball-and-socket-style hook fits perfectly into the GPS and I can adjust the GPS to be in just the right position. I can see the GPS perfectly AND it doesn't block my view. The mount is like a weighted beanbag, so you can set it up in a myriad of positions.When I get to my destination, I just slip the mount into the covered lift-up bin between the front seats and all evidence of having a GPS in the car disappears, leaving no tell-tale marks or (semi-)permanent mount markings the car.A great accessory, and highly recommended."
5,This thing is awesome!,"This little device works great. Just clip your Nuvi (mine is a 650) on, plug it in (if you want), and set it anywhere. I set mine in the center of the dash. It NEVER moves and is very stable. My wife and I transport the Nuvi back and forth from our cars, and this is the ideal mounting device for that.Get one!"
5,Garmin Portable Friction Mount,"I have been completely satisfied with this GPS Mount. It fits nicely on inner frame of the car.I can adjust the direction for myself or the passenger. It is weighted enough that it doesn't slide around, and locks in place with ease."
4,Portable Dashboard Mount for Nuvi GPS's,This has 'bean bag' type base that holds the GPS steady wherever you want to place it on top of the dashboard. It is a bit less bulky than a similar one a friend uses and about the same price. The GPS snaps into a holder and the holding arm snaps into an arm extending up from the base. No magic in this product except maybe how securely the GPS interfaces with the holding arm. No problem in that regard. A secure fit would be my only concern in choosing a similar but lower priced unit.
5,Great addition to the Nuvi 350,"This product is really great. We use this mount to transfer the GPS between my wife's car and mine, and the mount, while a bit big, holds tight to the dash. A great buy for someone who wants to use something other than the suction mount."
5,Good product,Got the friction mount after reading a number of reviews and am very happy with it. It allows me to easily use my navigator in two cars and can be hidden out of sight without a lot of hastle.
5,Love this!,"I love this mount! The suction cup mount that came with my Garmin Nuvi became misshapen and unusable within one month. I've had the GPS for a few years and just kept it on my lap listening to it and occasionally lifting it up to see it, just like I would paper directions. I finally broke down and bought this dashboard mount. It changed the way I use my GPS, into more the way a GPS should be used. In addition, I opened the package it came in in front of my family and after seeing how wonderful it is (that there are no suction cups involved, the arm and ball lock into the base) they went out and bought their own. And it's dirt cheap. Away from suction cups!"
5,Works in our fire trucks,"We purchased these for the Garmins in our fire trucks...they work great, stay in place on the dashboard, and are always where we want them while responding to emergencies. I'd recommend them.Chief"
4,Does what I bought it for,"I previously used a winshield mount, but with the increase in GPS theft threats I became wary of that circular blur left on my windshield after stowing my GPS away. This little circular mark is an invitation to GPS thieves because they know you have a GPS somewhere in the car. This dash mount does what it claims, wherever you place it, it isn't going to slide or fall off the dash. It leaves a slight dullness on your dash after removed, but nothing permanent. If you use Armorall on a regular basis, you can wipe it away with a tissue after removing the mount."
4,One small criticism...,"Great product, excellent idea. Read other reviews for more details. Fits just about anywhere, and stays put. The only criticism is that the rubbery ""underpart"" material holding the mount in place starts to show wear almost immediately. Keep out of direct sunlight when not in use so the bottom doesn't dry out, crumble or break apart. Otherwise, as stated: a great, user-friendly, wonderfully functional device."
4,Portable mount Works on New Cars,"Garmin Portable Friction Mount for Nuvi, StreetPilot I Series & C530, C550 (010-10908-00)This mounts works perfectly on a new car dashboard such as a 2007 Ford Edge; but my old 1997 Tarsus dashboard it does not work at all; it slides right off. No doubt leading to its conflicting reviews. In my car it has to ride in my passenger seat."
5,Great if you don't want a permanent mark on dash,I bought this so I wouldn't have to have my device mounted to my windshield or make a mark on my dash. I love it. It dismantles and I can put it into my console so it is out only when I want it to be.
5,Great Item for your Garmin GPS,This Garmin portable friction dashboard mount is excellent. It can be placed on you dash or other surface without allowing the GPS to slide or move. It's a must have if you want the flexability to use your GPS in different vehicles.
5,Highly recommend for the Garmin C550 GPS,"Very happy with this product. It does not shift on the dashboard yet it is removable/portable. It is the perfect companion for your Garmin C550 GPS receiver. Anyone in a ""hot"" climate should purchase this item."
5,Excellent GPS mounting solution,"I wasn't sure if this product would perform as well as I was hoping on the hilly and twisty Pittsburgh roads, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. It's very stable on the dashboard of my 2007 Honda Fit (Sport) and doesn't budge even when I take fast, sharp turns. It's much smaller than I thought it would be also, which makes it easy to store in the glove compartment when not in use. And the best part is that you don't have to drive around with a big eyesore permanently attached to your windshield."
2,If I Only Had the Missing Attachment Piece,"Well, I did receive the ""Friction Mount"" for my Garman GPS. Only trouble is there was no attachment for the GPS to allow me to connect it to the mounting device. Surely there is one more piece to this. All I received is what you see in the picture. I'll admit I'm not the most handy person I know, but I do believe there is another part that I do not have. As a result, the Friction Mount is of no use to me...so far."
1,garmin mount,i have a garmin map thing.I don't like the suction cup mounting system.I ordered this to replace the suction cup thing.It did not fit my Garmin device.I had to mutilate my garmin to make it work.It works OK but I am irritated that the information in the ad did not say that it only fit certain Garmins
3,Garmin mounts,I ordered 1 Garmin friction mount and recieved and billed for two.To make it worse niether would fit my iQue M3 Garmin GPS.So I am stuck with two mounts that are no good to me and i'm out more than 4o dallars for nothing usefull.Not very happy about this but what can I do?Thanks for asking.Ken Whitsett
5,"Works great, and easy to hide","The suction cup we used before was stolen, but not the GPS as no valuables were in the car.So we decided to buy this instead for the ease of removal. That was over a year ago.pros: works great (in a Camry). Stable, easy to move... Built with quality: this is and feels solid. No problems, not looking worn out... after a year of use.cons: heavy, so you will want to leave it somewhere in the car. When left under a car seat for instance, if visible that might attract thieves (again)."
3,haven't been able to use yet...,"I wish this had come with instructions. I realize that other people are probably rolling their eyes and saying, ""what a lamebrain!"" but even with a bachelor's degree (yeah, okay, it's in English, but still!) it just isn't intuitive. I actually tried to use it yesterday but, in a hurry, I really couldn't figure out what goes where with my particular nuvi. I will sit down at some point (or get one of my teenagers to do it) and see if it actually works as it should, but even then I couldn't find a good spot for it on the dash of the Ford Escape. So as of this moment, it's a 1-star product for me but I'm taking into consideration the possibility of my being too dim to figure out how to put this together! Still, a little sheet with some diagrams would not have been too much to ask!"
4,Garmin Friction Mount,"This is a great device for your dash. It holds our GPS device at the right level for viewing, and heavy enough not to slip. When not in use-- it fits in one of our car compartments."
3,Helpful but not value for money,"The product looks like what I've thought. It certainly helps but considering the simplicity of the product, I doubt that it isn't worthy of the money."
4,Does the job,"I certainly like the friction mount better than the suction cup on windshield. It is less obtrusive, and is closer to driver so input is easier. It is clunky looking, but that is the only negative that I have."
5,Easy to use.,Easy to use in any of our vehicles. Can be moved around to the driver can see every turn on the map.
4,Still on my dashboard!,"After a significant period of time intentionally trying to dislodge this thing while driving, I can only say I have failed. It's still there. I can reach it to make changes and I don't have to rip it off my windshield every time I get out of the car. It is big - the only flaw I can find, but it still fits on my Fit, though admittedly not well. It is highly functional in every other way."
5,Works like a charm,Easy installation. Had none of the problems installing the ball joint as experienced by other users. Just takes a little firm pressure to pop it in. Conforms nicely to all surfaces and stays put. I might suggest removing it from the dash when not in use to preserve the adhesive qualitites of the base as heat can deteriorate the contact surface.
5,Excellent replacement,This is an excellent replacement for the windshield mount.I do not see the GPS fallen on the floor of the car every morning in summer and Winter.My suction cup would just not hold on any day with extreme weather.I got the idea of buying this because my Avis rental had one of these.And it is a good replacement. It fits right on my dashboard.
5,The mount works great!!!!,This GPS mount works great to keep your GPS in reach and in sight.You don't have to worry about a suction cup letting go and droppingyour expensive electronics.
5,So handy,"Love the fact that I can just plop this on the dash board before a real trip, but leave it in the closet when I'm doing local errands. It's so convenient that I bought a second one for a friend who hated the stickered base that came with her Garmin."
4,perfect for the deep dash console and windshield,this item lays comfortably on the dash. using the garmin was more difficult in the Honda Civic than other older cars due to the slant of the windshield and depth of the dashboard. the friction pad brought the unit closer to the driver and the co-pilot. don't hesitate. just buy it.
4,Very useful,"I am so glad I purchased this dashboard mount. I actually have mine mounted below the dashboard in a little alcove and it works fine there. I prefer to mount it there when I'm traveling in major cities so that everyone can't see that I don't know where I'm going, but would recommend putting it on the dashboard when driving distances/highway. It is so much easier (and private) than having your GPS suction cup-mounted. Worth the investment."
5,Finally,"This ""bean bag"" is the answer for me (finally) to locate my Garmin above the center console on a flat area of the dash on my Subaru Outback. No more suction cup failures or cables draped over the steering column. Garmin is now positioned perfectly for viewing by both front seat passengers. Also, it stays put."
5,Very useful mount for long dash in van,I was tired of having the suction mount pop off in hot weather and the friction mount solves that problem.
4,Reccommended,"I've actually used the mount in 5 cars in the month that I've had it and it worked fine in all of them. I was a little worried about the dash in my car, which is a hard plastic material that I had slicked up with a waxy cleaner. But the friction surface on the mount clings to the dash even on rough roads and curves. Much better idea than letting the GPS fall when the windshield mount comes loose. Good product - fair price."
5,So much easier,This portable mount is so much easier than trying to pull it off the window mount. You just pull the whole thing at one time.
5,Brilliant,"Looks great and holdsGPS tightly,though flipped sometimes on hard breaks,but still not a problem,as it still keeps the GPS uit safe.Also tried the other model from Garmin ,but this is better."
5,Great addition for GPS,This is a wonderful option/improvement to the windshield mounted device that comes with the GPS unit. Just remember - you have to have the tray that came with your GPS to make the friction mount work.
2,Will not stay in place on dash,Doesn't work like it's supposed to; slides down dash till it's ratteling against window. will try to find some removable tape to put on dash. if this unit wasn't filled so full it might get a better grip. Guess you can't believe any advertisements any more. Ron
5,It works better than all others !,"I tried a Bracketron UFM-210BL -I found the Garmin Portable Friction Mount is just better1. It can be picked up easily and the whole GPS moved to the floor when leaving the car2. It doesn't require a large sticky mat3. It has a smaller footprint than the Bracketron4. Altho it's not as appealing as the low profile mat , the convenience it offers far outweighs the appearance5. With 4827 positive comments - just buy it - you won't be sorry !"
4,Works great,"A little awkward to store because of size/shape, but works great and was reasonably priced. Replaced a different less expensive mount I had purchased that did not work well."
5,Garmin Friction Mount,"This stays right where you put it. I had my doubts, but am very pleased. I like the fact that the whole thing is removable from the dash and leaves no telltale attachment on the window."
5,Great Price and Product,The price was the best I found. The portable mount is practical and very stable.Garmin Portable Friction Mount [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging]
4,Garmin Portable Mount,Excellent product. Much easier to use and more flexible than the friction mount that comes with the Garmin. Once the portable mount is positioned on the dashboard it stays in place even if you have to stop suddenly.
3,"Good product, but could be better","Overall, this product works as described. It stays on the dashboard and does not move at all.Maybe my GPS unit is too heavy, it always tilt down, especially after we hit few humps on the road. I have to put something under my GPS unit to hold it up. I don't have the same problem with the window suction cup mount that comes with the GPS. I have to say that my gps is an older model. Maybe the newer Nuvi, wich is slim will not have the same issue as I do."
5,More Stable Then Expected,After 3500 reviews can more be said? The suction holder for my Garmin didn't hold anymore so it had to be replaced. The options were to spend very little money and get another window mount unit or a friction mount for three times the money. Obviously I opted for this type. I found it to be much more stable then I thought it would be. The weight and materials cause it to firmly stay put on my slanted and slick dashboard. It's easier to remove for security or to another car and my windshield doesn't get those annoying rings on it. I'll go with the general consensus - five stars for a design well done.
5,solid base,"The dashboard mount seems very solid. It has not slipped once. Unlike a windshield mount,you can easily hide this mount along with the GPS itself while your vehicle is parked, thus not tempting the wicked."
2,Not as stable as the suction cup window mounts,"The suction cup window mount for my Garmin broke, so I thought I would try this friction mount. It has a nice size, and is easy to set up. I started driving, and was impressed with how stable it was on the surface roads. However, then I got on the freeway, and the stability went out the window. With the window mount, the GPS didn't shake, and stayed put. I had driven over 8 hours without an issue. Unfortunately, I learned that the dash shakes a lot more than the window. I had trouble following the GPS while on the freeway, because it bounced around quite a bit from the vibrations in the dash. The friction mount didn't do much to dampen the vibrations. Also the friction mount slowly drifted across the dashboard as I drove no more than a few minutes on the freeway. So I am back to Amazon to buy a new suction mount for the window. I don't recommend this friction mount if you do a lot of freeway driving."
2,Garmin Killer,"True it will not slide but very often rolls to the floor.The first or second time it topples over because its top heavy, you worry if that could be a problem. Then one day it happens. It flips off the dash and slams to the floor shattering the control screen. The base needs to be wider to prevent roll overs."
5,geat way to mount my nuvi,I had not wanted a permanent mount as I use my Nuvi in two different vehicles. This solved the problem and is very steady when driving.
5,exceeded expectations,"I really thought that this thing would be crap. So, why did I buy it...simply, I have a nuvi 670, and my other-half and I use it in multiple cars. The suction cup mount for the windshield is not always the best option, and we only had one of those sticky disc things - furthermore, I did not want to use a sticky disc in EVERY rental car!I was so skeptical, that I put it on the dash without the nuvi (too afraid of breaking an $800 system). It didn't even MOVE! So, then I tried taking corners faster - still it didn't move. I'm really not willing to flip any of my cars just so that I can say that it moved.This little guy is great for putting in your friends car without putting horrible circular dirt on the windshield. It is also lightweight to travel with it and put it in a rental car, and can be stored away so that there is no sign of a nuvi in sight for those thieving little sods that will break your car window for a couple of candy wrappers and 27 cents!"
4,Good Alternative Mount for the Garmin Nuvi 350,"Sometimes you prefer a non-adhesive friction mount over a windshield mount when using your Garmin Nuvi 350. Although it is bulkier than the windshield mount, it does a decent job of keeping your GPS in easy sight & reach. No problems with the mount staying on the dash under normal driving conditions. I don't know if I could quantify it as a good value due to the price that Garmin charges for it."
4,It actually works,"I was a little sceptical of this when we first got it as a gift. It looked to bulky to actually be practical, so we didn't actually use it for a few months. But now after using it for almost a year, my wife and I are very satisfied with the product. We use it in two cars (Honda and Subaru) and and it has worked perfectly every time. No slipping, easy to use, and not as obtrusive as it appears. When not in use, we just stash the beanbag part under the seat or in a door pocket and put the GPS and plastic hardware in the glovebox. Thus, the tell-tale wrings from the windshield mount are gone, and potential thieves are none the wiser."
5,Garmin dash mount,Made the purchase based upon reviews from buyers. Glad that I did. Really the only way to go when traveling and making stops whereas you can merely remove the unit to back seat and not a temptation for theft.
5,Garmin Friction Mount,Original equipment mount made by/for Garmin in Garmin packaging. The price is considerably less than direct from Garmin. Works well and does not slip off the dashboard even with aggressive driving.
1,JUNK,Don't waste your money on this. It's junk. It is called a friction mount but it is just a bean bag. It moves around and you constantly have to move it back. stick with the winshield mount that comes with your unit.
1,Dashmount Review,"I bought this for a good friend as a christmas gift. At first he wasvery excited to finally get one, until he used it. It slid all over his Dashboard every time he rounded a curve. Needless to say, we are both disapointed about this product."
4,dash stand for my GPS,This item is simple and works great. No more GPS falling off my windshield on to the car floor. I can anglefor easy read and it is easily stored in glove compartment when not in use....Love it!!
1,So upset about the sale,"I ordered this item at the same time that I ordered the GPS that would *fit* it. Well, this Mount arrived lickety-split and that next day I got an email saying that there had been a miscount in the inventory of the GPS and it was simply not available.The price HAD seemed a bit **too good to be true***....Meanwhile, to return this item would have cost me about what I'd paid.I bought another Garmen without thinking/smarts because I needed it NOW, and this mount is way too big for the item I ended up getting.This all being said, it is a rather cumbersome, weighty item for a person who travels and wants to make quality use of the limited weight in baggage on airlines...............I really regret purchasing this."
5,Great for moving GPS between cars,This mount works great when you share a GPS between multiple cars. There's no need to mess around with the suction cup mount. Just grab the GPS and toss it on the dash.
3,Good but needs directions!,This mount came in a box with no directions. The original instructions for Nuvi 370 didn't have directions on how to get the 'ball' into the socket either. So I spent a good amount of time and needed research on amazon to figure out how to put my Nuvi on this mount. To get the ball into the socket you have to apply A LOT of pressure - I would have never done that if I didn't read it on here. They should put the directions on the box.Other than that it seems to be working good.
5,Perfect Solution!,"I had the suction cup mount for my StreetPilot. It was a hazard to drive with, constantly falling off the windshield. It's just a stupid design.So I purchased this mount - it is great. It stays put, you slide the mount in, position it and lock it in place - it's easy to remove the mount for storage. I don't know why I waited so long but if you have your Garmin crashing on your head while you drive, buy this mount!"
5,"A Definite ""Must Have""",You definitely want to have this mount if you have a Garmin GPS. It just kept falling off the windshield when I used the mount that came with the item. This stays in place and is easily removed when you are leaving the car unattended.
5,Great price and yummy!,"This is a great deal for the amount of pretzel packs that are given. We love these since they're only 100 calories each and perfect for a snack, pair with a sandwich, or just to stick in your purse if you get hungry."
2,Doesn't hold attention,"Bought this for my son's 3rd birthday (last May), and I don't think he has played with it more than a handful of times, for more than a couple minutes. I thought well maybe he was too young, but his older brother (17 months older) isn't too much interested either. I bought this because it was shaped like a train (which they both love) and it taught numbers (up to 10). FYI, our sons are extremely active and rarely sit for more than a minute. The toy itself is just as the manufacturer describes."
5,A must for prog rockers and music fans alike,"This 3 CD release is Rush's latest live collection (they usually release a live CD after every four studio records).Two of the CDs are taken mainly from the 'Test for echo' tour, and include mostly tunes from their last four albums ('Presto', 'Roll the bones', 'Counterparts' and the aforementioned 'Test for echo'), but also includes a few fan favorite classics, such as 'The trees', 'Closer to the heart', '2112' (a portion of it, anyhow), 'Freewill', 'The spirit of radio', 'Tom Sawyer' and 'YYZ'. There's also an updated drum solo by Neil Peart that will make you drool.As for the third CD, its taken from a concert in 1978 in London's Hammersmith Odeon, from some tapes *rediscovered* after more than 20 years when Geddy and producer Paul Northfield."
4,"Rush proves ""Test for Echo"" was great tour","This is a strong live album that has the live full-length version of ""2112"", which the band played live for the first time on ""Test for Echo"" tour. Two of the other stronger cuts are ""Analog Kid"" and ""Natural Science."" If you are a Rush fan, you will love this album. If you not a Rush fan, start at the beginning and buy ""Fly by Night"" and ""Caress of Steel"" first."
1,talk about milking the fans !!!,"This release is an absolute rip-off to the die hard Rush fans. C'mon, does Rush have to release a 3CD live set of already previously released live material?!?! The majority of these songs have beeb released on their previous live discs. How many versions of Closer To The Heart do we need!! And to top it off, Rush released a double greatest hits package in '97 (which also contain the SAME songs that are on DS). The sound quality of DS is poor."
2,Not that great people!,"OK everyone here is massive Rush fan and I am no exception (fanatic since mid-eighties) but these songs are sloppy! Listen to the meter. They seem to speed up and slow down all over the place! I think us fans deserve better. Maybe it's just me but I think a professional band should be TIGHT and you can say that's too ""sterile"" for I live recording, but I just disagree. Give that new Journey live album a listen if you want to hear a tight live act. Also Geddy's vocals are way down in the mix..what gives? I know he doesn't have the greatest voice in the world but it is the one that's defined their sound for over 20 years. Good overall effort, though."
2,overpriced brochure from Rational Corp,"In the grand tradition of Rational Corp - this is an overpriced book from Rational Corp to complement its overpriced software. I must commend the HealthCare example in the book that is described in fair detail. The book's website is empty and does not supplement the book's content - only contains a link to order the book and an email to contact the authors. If you have to buy it, buy a used copy or read the free marketing stuff on the Rational website."
4,"Very satisfied but, still wishing:)","The lightweight compact size makes it very convertible. We bought it to keep the battery on our sailboat topped up. Start out with a fully charged battery and it will maintain. However, if you put a serious draw on the battery and run it down it will take days to recharge it. Easy to carry and keep any electronic equipment charged while out in the wilderness doing that wilderness stuff.This is the first solar panel we have ever purchased and are very pleased with its versatility. Wish I had gotten the larger one for the boat. Product was received much earlier than expected."
1,cool,i love this song a lot a lot and i bought his cd tha first day it came out. tha only reason i gave it a one is because i wanted to see how many stars it would give it overall but really i rate this song 5 stars
3,GREAT IDEA COMPLICATED PROCESS,THE TOY CONCEPT IS A GREAT IDEA BUT IF YOUR USING IT FOR TURBO TWIST SPELLING BE PREPARED TO BUY DOWNLOADS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. AS FOR RIGHT NOW YOUR CAN GET FREE DOWNLOADS AFTER A VERY LONG COMPLICATED PROCESS. AFTER SPENDING TWO HOURS PREPARING A DOWNLOAD THE SERVER WAS TOO BUSY TO DOWNLOAD IT TO THE CARTRIDGE FOR ME.DON'T GET ME WRONG I THINK THE IDEA IS GREAT THEY JUST HAVE A FEW BUGS TO WORK OUT ....
3,Can't get a Hotsling to really fit right.,"The Hotsling didn't fit right, I tried a 1& 2 my two closest sizes. Maybe it's just me, I'm 5' and 115 lbs... the Peanut Shell sling size small fit me perfectly."
3,Doesn't work with iPhone,"Not a bad little toy - I got it on sale at a store near my house. Does not work with iPhone, works fine with my iPod Video 60GB.Sound is adequate, seems sturdy.Too bad about the iPhone."
2,Very compact & portable but disappointing sound,"I purchased and returned this miDock but was very disappointed in the sound reproduction. Music was ""shallow"" with minimal bass. Would recommend JBL On Stage; a little more pricey but with excellent audio in a small, portable size."
5,Incredible CD!,"This CD is a perfect example of a timeless children's praise classic! My wife started listening to this album when she was a preschooler, and now OUR preschoolers are listening to it, but on CD now instead of record!Please get this CD, it is really good!"
1,Horrible Tenth Anniversary For Greatest Wrestling Show Ever,"I don't own the DVD so I can't comment on the special features, but this had to be the biggest disappointment ever. At the time Stone Cold Steve Austin was on hiatus from the WWE after walking out the year before. WWE kept bringing notions on their television show that Austin would return at the special but after the superstar of the year was announced we all were left in disappointment. Plus WWE seemed to only award athletes who were in the organization at the time of the show. I can't see why they called it the tenth anniversary when all they did was really show highlights of the Austin era to time of release. Another reason why professional wrestling has lost its fans is this show. A huge disappointment and not even worth the one star for the lowest rating that it can be rated."
5,Summer Reading with a Kick!,"I read this book while I was back east this week -- I couldn't put it down! Those wonderful characters and clever structure...what a terrific read. I didn't want it to end, but thank goodness for Molly it did. If you're looking for an engrossing summer book, ""Going Nowhere Sideways"" is the one. I can only hope Hollywood doesn't make me wait too long for the film version."
1,not good for squirrels,Caught one baby squirrel .Next day an adult squirrel flipped over cage and broke the piece of plastic and it does not work -Lasted one day
1,So far nothing,I have had this out for several months employing several different baits. The bait gets eaten but the trap so far has not been triggered ever.
2,Havahart 0745 animal trap,"The product arrived as promised and in good condition; however, I do not care for the way the trap mechanism has been changed from the older model. I still have and use the older trap of this size, as well as the 2 larger sizes that use the older trap system."
5,Easy to use,"I purchased this Havahart 0745 trap in the hope of stopping three squirrels from completely devouring my entire vegetable crop. They had already finished off all my cucumbers, squash and half of my tomatoes. The trap was easy to set using small pieces of peanut butter on bread. I put a couple of small pieces on the fence for them to taste and they couldn't resist the larger piece in the cage. Within 3 hours I had my first squirrel. I transported him to the park, opened the door and he was relocated. The other 2 squirrels took only a couple more days. Thank you Havahart, I did not want to hurt them and this worked amazingly well."
4,Pleased thus far,"I set the trap up and caught 4 chipmunks in 3 days using sunflower seeds. None of them were harmed. No adjustments needed, fairly easy to use/figure out (who reads directions??). I only rate it 4 of 5 stars because I'm not sure how durable it is. I think a bigger animal could give it some issues, but for red squirrels and chipmunks, and probably large mice, it's fine and does the trick!"
2,"Effective, but disposable. Won't last.","This Havahart trap is effective. A little peanut butter and proper placement and you're sure to catch the rodent you're after. Unfortunately, the quality of Havahart products has declined over the years, so if you want to catch more than one critter, better buy several.Today, the 0745 trap I bought 4 months ago became useless when the clip that locks the door shut after a rodent has tripped it simply snapped off, rendering it useless.I don't mind having to bend Havahart's highly-effective mousetraps into shape when they arrive. That's easy. I do mind that the Havahart 0745 is essentially disposable."
2,Broken clip,"The clip that releases the door came broken. It does not make the trap unusable, I just have to use a screwdriver each time I reset the trap which is kind of a pain. Also, I have yet to catch a chipmunk. If I catch one soon I will rate this item higher."
5,absolutely unbelievable,"Tried all kinds of traps, nothing worked for these tiny chipmunks. This trap has such a hair trigger on it, it would trap just about anything! SO glad we gave it a go."
4,Caught several squirrels in just a few weeks.,Product was easy to use and got the job done. I just put some bread with peanut butter on it and the ground squirrels went right for it. I actually ended up catching a few each day on the weekends (when I could check it frequently). It was also easy to relocate and release the buggers.
1,Don't waste your money,quite simply a plastic tray that is too long and too narrow for the tank. it also does not alow enough clearance for the lever to raise up so you can flush. this is a terrible product and it is completely useless.
4,Replacement Toilet Tank Lid,"When the lid of my 23-year-old Eljer toilet was inadvertently dropped a few weeks ago, I searched for a replacement lid. Since a used lid would have cost 75% of the price of a new toilet, I decided to look for a plastic one at this time. The EZ-Flo Fit-All Plastic Toilet Tank Lid was a good choice. It was easy to assemble and fits my toilet well. The color is molded, so it will not chip or fade. Its neat rimmed edge creates storage space for bathroom accessories. All in all, a cost-effective solution."
1,Not as Pictured!,"Picture shows a thicker ""Heavy Duty"" grill, this is just a cheap steel wire grill. If you want the thick one search ""heavy duty grill"""
4,A Prelude to Great Works,"I am not a regular reader of short stories. In general, I do not like them. Still, as a Mark Helprin fan, this is one of his few works that I had not read. I pressed on ... when I concluded the final story, Ellis Island, I felt completely satisfied with the journey. If you've never read Helprin, I believe ""Ellis Island"" and ""A Vermont Tale"" are most representative of his longer works. Each story will tempt you to read his novels, all of which are poetic magic. As I read through these stories, I saw glimpses of each subsequent novel, particularly my favorite, ""A Winter's Tale."" If you've read Helprin before, you owe yourself the time to read this collection. If you are new to Helprin, this work will encourage you to read more."
2,Dance Teacher- annoying,"We have a couple other musical Sesame Street DVDs & Videos- I have a really hard time watching this one, and my 19 month old daughter doesn't pay much attention to it (and she loves to dance along to most anything)... The ""Dance Teacher"" is rather annoying & doesn't have a good singing voice. The scenes without the teacher are OK- where there is dancing & singing with other people. I wouldn't recommend this DVD- there are better choices out there."
3,Sesame Street: Get Up and Dance by Garth Brooks,"Not bad. The first part is ok, but the voice is a little annoying. Preschoolers love the beginning, but lose interest after that."
2,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, this tape did not live up to the quality of other Sesame Street tapes I have seen. The beginning of the tape is long winded and the toddler watching, who loves to dance, lost interest before the dancing began. The excercise leader seemed more aware of the camera than of the children. Once you get past the intro though, it does improve somewhat. All in all, I'd pass on this one."
3,what about little people?,"As an English ex-pat, who has been living in the US for 12 years, I am enjoying this book. It's a good read and makes me smile. But there is a glaring, glaring omission - children! Nothing about attitudes towards children, attitudes of children towards adults - nothing. It's like they don't exist. Nothing about the elderly either. This book is written by a 30-something about a 20 or 30-something's world. The author writes about her life and what matters to her. That's OK and it's amusing. But it cannot pretend to be a comprehensive or, as is often implied, 'scientific' account of English social behavior when it ignores so much of the population or the population's concerns."
3,Get the paper version not the Kindle copy,"I suspect this book was scanned in for the Kindle version as all of the photos were black and white, even on the Kindle Fire. Somewhat disappointing and hopefully not the case with the printed book."
1,Great until it fails.,I have owned many HP printers for years. I've never had a problem with any of them until this one. My formatter board failed just outside the warranty. HP doesn't stand behind this product and says you can have it serviced at your cost. All that you have to do is google search for formatter board problems with HP P2015 printers and see what you get. I told the tech support guy that I'd take my chances on baking the formatter board in the oven as recommended on the internet. What do I have to lose? HP knows of the problem with this product and they fail to stand behind it. This will probably be my last HP printer purchase. I would definitely stay clear of this model.
4,I liked it!,This book is vry informative and really has some great information. I wish more people would read it and learn a little!
5,fantastic sound - very bad user interface,"I had the Bose 5.1 all in one system which cost $2000, this one has much much better full (rich) sound quality than Bose!!!I buy this for only $1000 in Costco.I tried a $180 audio toslink cable from audioquest (optilink-3), which had improved sound over a $70 monster cable in Best Buy.this receiver would has alot depth in it's campabitlity if you can spend on opital cable.I run cable from optical output in my notebook and plays CD quality music, much better quality with different cable.again Bose is very bad, I had bad experience with Bose include it's PC speaker and headphone."
2,"An O.K. unit, but I expected more.","The H.K. AVR-340 is Heavy. At first look and feel it seems to be built rather well. Some of the things that I found later that were of poor quality were the instruction book to set it up properly. It was, in my judgement, poorly written. A loy of the set up became ""try this and see if it works"".There was a sticker on the front panel that said ""Remove after unpacking"". Unfortunately this is difficult. I pulled to get it off, but only the top layer of tape came off. I scraped withmy thumb nail for quite a while, but did not have much success. I tried alcohol to remove the sticky residue, which worked, but has left me with a dull section of the plastic.The volume knob is plastic instead of metal and feels like plastic.In summary, I think that H.K. could have done a better job."
4,"Good, but with some notable errors","I am rather fond of the story of the Nightingale (I wrote a modernized version for a Spanish class which went well), and looked for a copy of this novel for a long period of time with no success. I finally found a copy in Ashland, Oregon, while on my first visit to the Shakespeare Festival (amazing, just amazing, though this is a side note), and read it on the long trip home. I had no problems with it then, and enjoyed the story, but now having read more about Japanese folklore and spending time with people who speak Japanese, it is harder to thoroughly enjoy. ""Kitsune"" and ""Hidoi"", for example, would certainly never be used as names, and the moon deity Tsuki-Yomi is male, not female. However, if one does not take every detail too seriously, the overall spirit is engaging and the characters are endearing (except, perhaps, the Emperor, of whom we simply do not see enough). Recommended, for light reading."
3,some background,"Just wanted to provide a little background for this book. The animus between Wolin and Derrida, which the first reviewer perceived, is real. Wolin reproduced (in the first edition of this book) Derrida's ""the Philosophers' Hell"" without permission and in a poor, often misleading translation. (Derrida cites many of these errors in ""Points..."" pp. 440-444. The editor of that text cites more of them on pp.486-487.) For these reasons, Derrida requested that it be excluded from subsequent printings. There is also an exchange consisting of several letters and articles from the various parties printed in The New York Review of Books in the Spring of 1993."
4,Liberty's Kids,"Very good and educated shows for kids but it doesn't have closed captions. On TV, it does but not on DVDs."
3,A good way to pass the time in an airport,While no one will ever be as good as Puzo in detailing for us the readers the fortunes of the Family I have to say the author captures enough of the essence of the characters involved for the book to not read like glorified fan fiction (for the most part). The only draw back is of course the one thing that dogs every book that is supposed to fill in the blanks of a story it doesn't matter how good your story is if we already know the ending.Overall-Even though we know the end result this book is still worth the read if you are a Godfather fan.
2,Along the Godfather line,"I have read all the books related to the Godfather line and seen the movies, too. So I thought when I picked up this book, I would be entertained in the same manner as the rest. Unfortunately, this book did not hold my attention or pique my interest as the others did. I didn't get the same ""edge of my seat"" thrill because it contained more explanation and dialogue than it did action. The ending was lackluster and bland."
4,Not the best...,"Not the best of the Godfather knockoff novels, but I enjoyed it. It's good to see the characters continue in their lives."
1,WORST EXPERIENCE EVER MAD MONKEY WAREHOUSE SUCKS,"This was a total waste of time. I never received my book and had to file a AMAZON A-Z guarantee. I don't know why how AMAZON allows MAD MONKEY WAREHOUSE on their website. I have been waiting almost a month for the book and now I have to purchase it again from another vendor. MAD MONKEY WAREHOUSE SUCKS!!! DO NOT BUY FROM MAD MONKEY WAREHOUSE!!! They didn't even contact me after several emails and phone calls. THE MONKEY WAREHOUSE is probably run by monkey's and definitely has no books. But even MONKEYS could probably figure out how to send a reply message via email. So who knows what is going on there. Maybe they don't know how to read and sent the wrong book to wrong address, but then who would hire someone that can't read to work with books. Only MAD MONKEY WAREHOUSE ladies and gentlemen. Hiring Monkeys and people who can't read in a book warehouse."
1,Mario Puzo Rolling Over,"One of the worst books I have read. The Godfather was a one of a kind book. This is another one of those books were the family of a good writer is trying to make a few bucks off the guys name. Even worst than the formulaic ""new"" Ludlum books. Slow, ponderous and not a compelling read. The last aprt of the book was just about filling in some gaps from the movies and served no real literary purpose."
2,No better than rabbit ears!,"I had high hopes that this would bring in digital channels better than my old rabbit ears or the other passive HD antennas I have tried. But no such luck. It does bring in a couple of distant channels more consistently than my rabbit ears, but fails to bring in three public TV digital channels that the rabbit ears capture. I moved up to the Winegard SS-3000 amplified antenna, and that did the trick, although it seems overpriced. Reading the reviews here, it makes me wonder how many people assume that they need a digital antenna to bring in digital channels and never try their old one, since the old ones seem to do almost as well with most channels."
5,great reception in downtown nyc,"I had an old rabbit ear that got me 1 channel. When I got this one, it was crystal clear and received more than 20 channels. This antenna was for an apt building near a lot of other buildings and trees."
4,For What It Is Worth,"This antenna works great for stations 30 to 40 miles away. Unfortunately the majority of stations in my area are over 75 miles away. I mounted mine at 20 ft and even with a preamp this antenna does not have enough gain to reliably pick them up with a 24/7 constant signal. I give it 4 stars because it is constructed well, easy to assemble, and does work well on the closer stations."
1,What?,"I can't believe the praises for this. It works no better than an old, inexpensive one I had lying around. Not one channel is close to HD quality. What a waste of money."
1,This film is purposefully misleading and sneaky,"From the name of the production company (Hatikvah Film Foundation -- Hatikvah is the Israeli national anthem) to the innocuous packaging design and description on the vhs case, this ""documentary"" seems designed to lure unsuspecting Jews to watch what purports to be an interesting documentary about Jerusalem and the Prophets of Israel, but which slowly reveals itself to be a ruse and is rather an underhanded attempt at conversion, selectively mirepresenting the Hebrew Bible and ending with the hope that Jews will come to see who their ""true"" messiah is. Why not be forthright and honest about your intentions from the get go? I appreciate the support for Israel but am very offended by the sneaky way this film goes about proselytzing. It is not done in good faith, to say the least. (Note: I took this film out at the public library and was completely surprised when I realized its true contents)"
2,Not enough info,"This book doesn't have enough recipes or enough ways to use essential oils. I havent found anything i was looking for in it. I wanted to know how to use the essential oils for applying to hair and skin, etc and I couldn't find the answer."
4,Doug Moo moo moved me,"Bought this as a resource for our Bible Studies look at James. Already had Moyter's commentary, this one has a less devotional, more technical feel. Accessible, deep, a def resource for our study."
1,wrong plug,"they never described the plug part of the keyboard...i was so exceited to get it sonce my current keyboard no longer had any visible letters....well - the one I needed had to have a USB and this did not. very unhappy - sent it back - went to Best Buy and for $15 bucks got a logitech keyboard - which I love,..."
4,Kudos HP,"After many reviews read, I chose this keyboard. I'm satisfied with it. Clean look, the keys are smooth upon pressure. Priced right!"
2,Not worth the purchase price.,"My primary complaint with this book was its predictability. Less than halfway through, I knew exactly what was going to happen, and I wasn't wrong. So it was just a matter of slogging through the rest to get to the end.I also wasn't overly amused by most of the so-called witticisms and amusing one-liners of several characters. It wasn't endearing, only annoying.All in all, pretty disappointing."
5,A Must Read!,I loved this book! From page one I was sucked into the story and I found it very hard to put down. Jane Moore's humor in this book is so great. If you are looking for a great read then this book is a must read!!!
5,Pretty and user friendly !!,Product is really easy to use. I bought it for my niece as a birthday present. And even though she is 2 years old she had fun taking pictures with it !!
1,Awful,"I can't really say anything that hasn't been said before. I bought this camera last July for my son's 4th birthday. It is small, about the size of a box of matches. Too small for small hands.Has an LCD on the back, but it only shows picture number, no preview. No flash. Holds about 50-60 pictures, that my son went through in about 3 minutes. He didn't seem to care that he didn't see a preview, but never asked to use it again after we downloaded the first batch of pictures and no one could tell what was in them. I uploaded some examples.The viewfinder is not lined up with the lens so even pictures taken by an adult are bad and cut off. Indoor pictures were just terrible, outdoor pictures wouldn't be too bad if viewed only in small preview size, not printed, and if the viewfinder lined well enough to get pictures that weren't all decapitated and the side of the image...shoulda just given him my old digital camera and bought a new one for myself..."
1,These reviews are TOTALLY accurate!,"I thought that maybe some of these bad reviews were for the other models of the disney camera. It doesn't matter! I got the more expensive disney pix max camera ($75) and it performed EXACTLY as every bad review on here states. Grainy pictures, way to bright with flash and too dark without. The wait time between pushing the button and the picture snapping is FOREVER.I am SO glad that I checked out the quality before giving it to my daughter. I will be taking this back tomorrow and looking for a new product."
1,Awful,"Awful quality. Even 0.3 megapixels could produce pictures of a much better quality. Linear distortions and so on.Also, the description misses one important thing: it doesn't have a display that could show the pictures taken.It's only worth one dollar, not fifty! Do not buy"
1,Disappointed,This camera is really small but has no viewer screen. We ended up getting a different camera for our 7 yr old.
1,Terrible,"Two of my daughters received these cameras for Christmas and were both very disappointed at how bad the pictures turned out. I tried to tell them that it takes practice to get good pictures but even when I used it the pictures turned out horrible. It is also disappointing that there is no screen to view the pictures and that they have to wait to see them on the computer. I have not seen either of my girls use these since the week of Christmas, huge waist of money."
2,"Ok camera for 6 year, could be better.","I bought this camera for Christmas for my 6 year old soon instead of the fisher price kids digital camera. I thought being a 3mp it would produce better quality than the fisher price. I was mistaken. Even after transferring the images to my computer they are fuzzy, poor quality, and the lighting absolutely sucks. When the flash is on it washes everything out, when its off you can't see the subject at all if the picture is taken inside. We have not been able to try it outdoors yet. My son was able to figure out the features and it is easy for him to use. He enjoys the camera and doesn't seem to have any complaints about it. I should have spent a little extra money and gotten him a cheap namebrand camera made for adults. I would not suggest this camera for other children if you are looking for printable pictures."
3,Camera didn't work out but supplier refunded.,"This camera did not work out for us, but the supplier M Z Photo promptly refunded our money, so this was a quick and easy transaction. I would recommend M Z Photo as a great dealer."
1,"Absolutely, positively garbage!",I purchased this camera for my 7-year-old Daughter. It looks like a cute little camera but the pictures that it takes are horrible. They are so blurry and so dark that you can hardly see anything. The camera doesn't have any type of flash and it is badly needed. We even tried taking pictures in very bright light and the pictures still look like they were taken outside at midnight without a flash. I don't leave 1 star reviews very often but I feel this camera is very deserving of it.
2,how could they have thought it would be so easy?,"there doesn't seem to have been much thought put into this one. while musicaly tight w/ the occassional guitar moment lyricaly it sucks .song after song of everyone yelling the name of the song 3 to 5 times & that was the chorus .all the way up to track 9,""dazed & confused""cover. very nice ,worth the 50 or whatever cents i payed (plus s&h)fer it.& whats this? track 10s a jammin'original ,can't say that i know what its about but oh well .if you wanted to know what happened to suicidal tendencies ex drummer amery smith ,here he is.wow......i wanna know what happened to grant estes.anyway this album is only a penny now so why not?"
5,Clear and simple interpretation of an Ancient Philosophy,"Archie Bahm's interpretation is by far the easiest to take in. Clear, concise and straihtforward, without any attempt to mystify the meanings.The last chapters about Lao Tzu, Tao, Teh and Confucius is very informative."
1,"Oh Well, I tried","This game did not happen! It would not function properly on a Laptop running XP Home. I thought an old game should work on a new computer, but it didn't happen. I took out my frustration by getting ""Legend"" for the PS2."
2,I had quality issues - twice,"The other reviewers don't seem to have had these problems, but the first mill I received had mis-molded teeth that wouldn't mesh so it couldn't grind at all. I returned it for a replacement and the second grinder had good teeth but the lock popped off before it was ever used. Rather than return it, I glued the lock back on. The grinder looks great and seems great, but I would take a look at one of the competitors because of the quality issues."
3,Interesting and Eh,"I wasn't impressed by any of the acting in this movie, and I thought the daughter's role could have been left out entirely. The plot was interesting but kind of faded away to blah at the end. I liked the plot of the husband having two lives in another country, but the IRA thing was kind of weird. It did make things suspenseful for a little minute, though, and I guess without it there wouldn't be a movie. I didn't get why Kathryn had to travel to the last place that was in the poem John loved so much. The poem could have been left out, too, in my opinion. Nothing really happened there in Ant--- whatever it was called. The ending was unsatisfactory and didn't really fit in with the rest of the movie.The best thing about this movie was Campbell Scott just because I think he's hot. Too bad he didn't hook up with Kathryn. That would have been weird, but I would have given another star if that had happened. ;)"
5,Gentle Ben,This book is great. It is a good book but it also have alot of words that 9 year olds wouldn't understand if they didn't look them up. I'm 11 years old and almost 12 so I would have to say that you should have a good voabulary if you are interested in reading this book. Over all I give this book 5 stars. GREAT BOOK!
1,Very Poor,Very poor print quality. I just sent mine back. My 15 year old laster printer has better quality.
4,Chicano love songs,"I used to have the album a long time ago. Since I had the original album it didn't sound as scratchy as the Disk that I purchased with Amazon.com. There is too much grainy sounds on some of the songs on the disk. If the grainy sounds would disappear,it would be great."
4,Great Video for Mental Health Professionals,"This video is great for use by mental health professionals who work with teens, as well as teachers, parents, and pediatricians.The video discusses both unipolar and bipolar depression. Parents of teens who actually committed suicide are interveiwed throughout most of the program. The video also presents recent research on impulsivity and suicide risk. Finally, the video closes with efforts a school system is making in order to identify depressed teens, and to provide help for them.This video generates good discussion among parents, college students, teachers, and counselors. The video assumes the audience possesses some knowledge of unipolar and bipolar depression, but not a tremendous amount."
3,Good but not great.,"An interesting look at the political world and the reporters who cover it. It would be better if Matt didn't try so hard at being cute and smarter than everyone. His view point is entertaining, but it is also a view that hangs arrogantly above everyone-that gets old. Matt is inventive and smart, he doesn't cover the campaign in its usual way. Overall it is a good read, but Matt is so proud of his style that it wears on you."
2,GOING TOO EASY ON A START-UP PUBLISHER,"I have mixed feelings about this book. On one hand I love the idea (hold a nation-wide photography contest to produce a book featuring American children as taken by moms and dads-basically amateurs), but the book fails miserbly on the execution. The book is cheaply made and does not do justice to the photographs. Some of the photographs are rough to begin with while others with high potential suffer from the super-poor printing. The worst part is the price. I usually associate with the likes of books by Aperture, Phaidon, etc. and even their good stuff doesn't cost [this much]! Save your money. If the publisher could have faithfully reproduced the photos and packaged it appropriately that may have justified a book in [this price] range, but honestly this book should be selling for [much less]."
5,My daughter's favorite!,I bought this book because it came highly recommended and is now my daughter's favorite book. It has always made her laugh with its adorable pictures!
4,FORTRESS OF THE DEAD,Mysterious ghost story more related to an extended Twilight Zone or similar horror anthology series. A sole survivor of a unit wiped out on Corregidor in WW2 returns to the island 23 years later.
3,Barely functional,"Very flimsy. Top, bottom, and seed starting tray. The heat mat is weak, and after I removed the dome so I could lower the grow light close enough to the new growth, it could not maintain 80 degrees. Used Hydrofarm MTPRTC Digital Thermostatto control and monitor temp.Gave it an OK because the tomato seeds all came up and continue to grow. Now two weeks old."
3,decent for price,I was satified with this only because at price it was like getting dome tray for price of just heating mat at hydro stores locally where I live.
5,"Small, attractive, classic and accurate","I bought this one for myself to replace an old, originally electric, mantle clock that I had converted to a quartz battery movement many years ago. In had just fallen apart. Although this new one is about half the size of the old one, it is quite attractive in its dark cherry finish. The numerals are clear and easily read from across the 12"" of my office and, after about two weeks, it remains perfectly in synch with my 'atomic' wrist watch. For the money, it is really quite nice and elegant yeet unobtrusive. A nice compliment to any room in th house or to an office to add just a touch of the classicalong with the correct time."
2,a little boring,"i thought this was the free amazon movie rental, so when i clicked to watch, i was disappointed. it is my fault for jumping ahead too quickly."
3,okay,"I thought I really like this movie but it wasn't my favorite. Most of my friends loved the movie, but not one I want to own."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"THIS SIS A LOT OF MIXTURE AND CONFUSION OF PATHS AND FAITHS. RECOMMENDED ONLY FOR THOSE HEAVILY INTO THESE WAYS. OTHERWISE, IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME. DON'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO READ IT. MAYBE FOR THOSE INITIATED INTO SOMETHING LIKE THIS IT WOULD BE USEFUL BUT I AM NOT SURE. THIS IS NOT WHERE YOU WOULD FIND INFORMATION TO LEARN. READ OTHERS FIRST."
2,huh?,i have not even been able to finish this book because i just couldn't relate to Dr. Karp's comparison of toddlers to prehistoric man. i just didn't get it. maybe when i have some free time i can finish reading this book and find something useful in it! i wouldn't waste my money or time on this book!
5,very good,very good helpfull book a lot of good advice still reading it but the reflecting feelings technique wrks very well
1,Monkey see monkey do!,"This book is the strangest book on childcare I've ever read. Monkeys and cavemen, I wonder how Nanny 911 would handle Dr. Karp and his children in his home. I guess it's how one believes if we came from Adam and Eve or monkeys. I'm having problems with his approach, if the ideas presented in his book create the kind of relationship I would desire to have with my children."
1,Stupidest Book on the Block,We really liked his Happiest Baby on the Block book so we bought this one very eagerly. What a waste of time and money. Comparing toddlers to cave men and talking to them like idiots just went against our grain. Save your money on this one and invest in other strategies that don't demean your children!
2,couldn't finish it...,"I was excited to read this book, due to it's location. But sadly to say, it just didn't hook me. I usually give books around 50 pages or so, then stop reading it if it doesn't seem worthwhile. That's all I read."
3,Claws,"Jed's got a great girlfriend, good grades, and a star rike in the tennis team. He figures his life is pretty well perfect until he gets a note telling him to meet at a nearby cafe. He shows, and this pink-haired punk girl sits down and tells him that his father is having an affair with her mother. Angst, angst, stuff falls apart, and in the end it all comes down to a kayak, a sudden storm, and a rescue by helicopter.I was okay with this one (good, solid read even if I liked Zipped by Laura and Tom Mcneal MUCH more as a variant on the whole parent-having-an-affair thing) up until the last chapter, which came completely out of left field. The ending didn't fit with the rest of the tone and story, and left me feeling vaguely cheated as a reader."
4,If you plan to sculpture with CLAY consider this book 1st!,"I was pleasantly surprise once I received this book and found myself captivated by the detailed. When I ordered from ""OrderFromMe!"" little did I realize my books would have extra wrapping to protect their delivery process. Reading within the pages of these chapters offers ideas to accomplish my projects in workable methods. I chose to sculpture to help my stress levels. But I may be walking into enjoyment by learning a skill I can offer my granddaughter. Excellent read. Should you find you want to make jewelry try; ""Making Polymer Clay Beads: Step-by-Step Techniques for Creating Beautiful Ornamental Beads"" and have fun while looking smart"
2,NO INSPIRING Projects,"I'm a mixed media artist and wanted a book to introduce me to Polymer clay for Jewelry making. Since this book has a nicely illustrated cover and so many great reviews, i decided to purchase it. Sadly, I coudl not find and inspiring step by step project. Sue demostrates many ""techniques"" but never walks you completely through a project to finish a piece. So it is what the tite says, just techniques. This cousl have ben a smashing book if it had 3 or 4 projects with complete step by step, start to finish instructions for at least a few of the techniques. I'm sure i'll put it back on half.com :)"
2,The FOAM BOOK,"I expected more from a 25$ book, this is not suitable for kids due to the fact that there is nearly not enough diagrams and simple color images.For young adults maybe good but again not enough break down on the actual manufacturing process. I don't like putting bad reviews, but due to the fact that I use a lot of books to teach and work. This is deffently overrated. My advice is start with 'the puppetry handbook' by Anita Sinclair ....It is great value"
4,Left out,This is a GREAT book in so many ways but I do feel as a beginner that there are a few things they left out. I found myself left with a few questions and no way of discovering what to do next. One thing that would of been great would be fabric/material swatches. I think I know what I'm looking for but swatches would help.
3,Made in Mexico,"I like Nivea Creme quite a lot, and wanted to try the 'Made in Germany' version to see what all the hype is about. Unfortunately, though the seller ""American Beauty"" writes 'Made in Germany' in the product description, the product upon receipt was in fact the same old U.S. 'Made in Mexico' stamped on the jar product."
1,Poor Design,"Right after assembling this dryer, the small plactic part that holds the dryer head to the base snapped. This plastic post, which is weakened by the holes drilled through it for the three attachment rivets, is poorly designed and too weak to handle the torque created by the weight of the dry head. This attachment point is critical in this type of dryer, and should be strong."
4,Great option for home treatments,"With naturally curly hair I do deep conditioning treatments at least every few weeks. This really allows the treatment to penetrate my hair and makes a big difference. I used to use a cap and hose that you connect a hand dryer to - that was a big pain in the butt and I found the only ""comfortable"" way to manage the cords and the hose and the dryer while keeping the bonnet on my head was to sit on the floor next to the outlet. With this, I pull it up behind my computer chair and can get work done. It is also important for curly hair to dry naturally or slowly to prevent frizzing and maintain nice curls. This has been a nice adjunct when I need to speed up the drying process - again allowing me to do so while I use my computer. The only downside is it is difficult to maneuver and store, and is very top heavy. I already broke when when moving as it toppled and the bonnet cracked off the base :( Still, for a salon like treatment at home it is hard to beat."
5,so far wonderful!,"dries really fast, is pretty, and is easy to put together. it is just what i wanted, a fast way to dry my hair while i read."
4,Fun and educational,"This is the second of this series that I purchased for our currently 9-year old boy. He really enjoys it although he goes through phases when he doesn't play with it (too many other toys, maybe?). I think the entire Leap Frog line is very good and educational and better than just playing some computer game with no value. I recommend it."
4,Great fun while learning,"My 7-year old son has this one, Brain Blaster and Turbo Twist Math and loves to play with them. We also have the Mind Station and I have created his own spelling cartridges for the week. He loves to spell and this makes it more fun to learn."
3,WAIT!,Right now this toy is just like all the other spelling toys on the market. It cannot do what the box says it can do yet. For instance the box says if you buy the leap link to go with it you can download your child's spelling list. You cannot do that beacause the leap frog web site is not ready to do that yet. I e mailed them and they said it MIGHT be ready by mid November. I personally bought this toy because of all the extra benefits it said it had. Had I known that the company was selling a product that is not even ready yet I would not have bought it. That is why I gave it such a low rating. I was being generous with the three stars. Maybe once leap frog gets their act together and it can be used to its full capacity I will rate it differently. So if you haven't purchased one yet WAIT!
5,Great Learning Tool,"We bought this item for my son last Christmas, but it wasn't until this year, when he entered the first grade, that he actually started using it to help him with his spelling lists. Being able to download your own spelling words is fantastic. The website offers generic spelling lists according to grade level that you can download. With this toy, my son can study in the car and at other times when I'm not around. After he's done studying, I can print out a progress report to see in what areas he may need help. Be careful not to ""slam"" the big button on the end when entering your answers. It has broken once, and luckily, my husband was able to take it apart and fix it. The Turbo Twist Spelling has great features like a ""repeat"" button and volume control. It says encouraging phrases and can even address your child by his first name."
4,Can't find accessories.,"I bought the Turbo Twist Spelling for my 7 year old Grand-daughter. I have looked everywhere that I can think of & I can't find the part that lets you download her spelling list from the internet. I would think that this would be available so I could make this item work the way I intended it to when I bought it. I sure could use help in finding where I could get one. My daughter-in -law tried leapfrog, and she couldn't find it there either."
4,"Well, At Least They're Entertaining","This series manages to be entertaining and laugh out loud funny without addressing the story every volume. While this series continues to make me laugh, there is still concern that they are going to run out of time to introduce the story and get us through the second half effectively. Hopefully the close of this half is foreshadowing something good in the coming episodes. In the meantime though, this series is worth just sitting back and enjoying. The writing is sharp and its clever nature warrants continued viewing."
1,"Cheap, non functional","Don't buy it!!Only the setting to lower your voice works... somewhat.The other settings are useless. The output is unintelligeble. Yeah, like that."
1,"Product arrived quickly, but did not work.","Product arrived quickly, but did not work. Returned it and got a refund."
3,Alum tree,"This was our 1st aluminum tree, a little disappointed, not as full as I thought it would be.I would probably not get this model. Have a happy!!"
3,"Adequate, Overpriced","This product is essentially a set of five flat cardboard boxes, each one inch high with a few small bits of cheap hardware and some staples. Once again, it shows the difficulty of evaluating merchandise by looking at a picture. It is adequate for its purpose, but ought to be half the price."
1,Surbex Vitamin Disappointment,"Years ago I bought Surbex B-complex at the drug store, and did well with it, then it became only available in Canada. Recently I found it on the Internet sold by AmericaRX. I ordered it through Amazon.I received it two days ago, and yesterday, after a meal, I took a Surbex. The Surbex made me very sick later, and throughout the night.I believe this was definitely caused by the Surbex. Now I am afraid to take another tablet, and there are 100 in the bottle. I became concerned as to whether this vitamin was made out of the country, and upon examining the bottle it was made in Barceloneta, PR for Abbott laboratories. I do not recommend this product, and AmericanRX and Abbott should take another look at this before they sell it to trusting customers. What happened to the real Surbex, the good and safe product?"
5,got it for mom,my mom loves this game. great mother's day gift or little christmas gift that means so much
2,Fairly dopy movie,"Very odd and original movie about shrinking people to microscopic size and injecting them into a man's body to allow them to do laser surgery in his brain and save his life.They gave some special reason why his life was so important to save, something about national security, but that was irrelevant to the movie. It was so irrelevant that the movie never bothered to tell us whether the man was saved, and nobody cared. He was just an excuse to make a movie about traveling inside the human body.So we get to see red blood cells floating in liquid. We get to see the inside of the man's ear. This and that. Actually a fairly dopy movie.They even gave us a bad guy. One of the micronauts is a saboteur.The movie fails to give me the feeling that it takes place inside a human body. The plot fails to grab me. But it's a novel idea anyway. If a college kid put it together I'd say the kid did a fairly interesting job for a college project."
4,Not her best...but...,"This is a great quality cd. Lisa Stanfield was my favorite singer for about 5 years growing up, so when i found this at Borders music as an import title, i coughed up 30 bux to get it. Real love is still my personal favorite, i think it features her musical talent the best way. There are great up cd's on Natural, like Little bit of Heaven and track number 4. I Give you everything is a great ballad, too. This is a solid album, but if you want 1 album by her i would get Real Love."
2,Disappointing,"This book started off really well. The story of Hanna was riveting. As I read on to discover that the narrator was Johanna, the grandaughter, I became totally disenchanted. What person could recreate the story of their mother AND grandmother with such rich detail with only old photographs and newspaper clippings? Who can look into the heart of another and know how they feel, especially when that person has passed away or is lying in a nursing home mute and unresponsive? I highly doubt that even with all of the diaries in the world someone could tell such a story. I was very disappointed with this book and have to agree with one of the other reviewers here on another point...Hanna only had one daughter."
3,Disappointing and passionless,"I usually LOVE books about mother-daughter relationships, especially ones that span more than two generations. I found this book hard to follow, though, with the going back and forth between characters and with the women's names being so similar. The writing was strangely bland and in my mind, did not bring the women to life. I regret paying full price for this book."
4,A book about growing as a human beeing,"This book goes under your skin. No mother/daughter relationship is the same but there is always the tension and the tenderness, and Marianne Fredriksson describes it delicately and without mercy. Her characters, as always, come alive on the pages. They bring out emotions of old and yet still erupting. However this is not Ms Fredrikssons best book. I hope and pray that her amazing books about Eve, Kain, Norea, Noah and others will be translated as well as her latest Maria Magdalena, for all my english speaking friends to ENJOY! Ms Fredriksson has the capability of putting historical and biblical events in a fiction format, and give it a womans point of view, that makes you feel you knew the people and can understand how it really happened."
2,A drag to finish,"There were too many characters that were similiar. I couldn't keep up with who was who and after awhile, I just didn't care anymore. I read this book for a book club and felt obligated to finish it. I don't understand why so many readers connected with the characters. I guess I'm in the minority though."
1,s e r i o u s dissapointment. DO NOT BUY,"this book is more than dissapointing. the book never says anywhere that the first three ""stories"" or chapters are only 23 pages in legenth.the main story is fairly good, adds a new element to movie, but other than that, DONT BUY THIS BOOK, only get it at the library if you insist"
1,Not that great...,"Like many here, I found this book because of the connection to the film A.I. However, even though the film itself had it's own flaws, the story it was based on was lacking itself: no obstacles, albeit potentially interesting characters, and not a very satisfying conclusion...having me asking ""And...?""""Supertoys Last All Summer Long,"" the lead story, was followed by two other sequels in the same book, but they also don't really have anything to say, no characters to latch onto, and no satisfying conclusions. Unfortunately, this basically describes the stories in the book overall.Writing short stories is difficult: Having a beginning, middle, end...and feel ""done;"" and, as aforementioned, having characters that we as readers find interesting and remember. However, the stories in this book read as if they were ideas that still needed developing."
5,I love this book,"This book is extremely well written and laid out. I like the easy explanations and diagrams, as well as the more technical boxes for those who wish to delve deeper. This is a great primer for AI. It should be required reading for those interested in learning about AI, to whet the appetite."
2,SHOULD HAVE READ ALLLLL THE REVIEWS FIRST,"I really wish I had read all the reviews to find out that this is not really a ""book"" but a ""booklet"". It is OK, but not enough information to justify the price of $12.95."
3,The glass on the magnifying side is wavy.,"The glass on the magnifying side is wavy. I can still use it, but it's a disappointment. The tweezers aren't very good. I like the case, though. I put my own (good) tweezers in it."
4,Truth & Reality of Indepedent Ball,"Garret Mathews did a superb job at getting into the game of an independent team. I enjoyed the company in the dugout. Garret did a good job at not forcing the issue of getting a quote all the time. It seemed like he would speak out at certain times of the game that was appropriate.Furthmore, he did a good job at getting quotes from most of the members of the team. It just shows you that there are so many different types of people from all over the world that can come together to form a baseball team."
3,"EROTICA, HORROR STYLE","SINFUL SECRETS is best termed an erotic horror story. In keeping with Thea Devine's style, no way is it a romance novel. Passion is discussed, but not love. A virgin stripper is kidnapped and taken away to become either the chosen child-bearer or the next meal for a deranged man, possibly a vampire. The hero enters, and with much luck and cunning, saves the day, and the stripper, while deflowering her (for the entertainment of their host). The story is the stuff of which horror fantasy is woven. If you're looking for something a little darker than usual and not very realistic, this may be your book."
1,Keep your hard earned dollar!!!,"In how many ways can I warn unsuspecting readers away from this tripe, I'd certainly need more than 1000 words to convey the message that this is the most poor attempt at erotic fiction I have ever had the misfortune to read. I know we are not looking for realistic here but for the love of God if you are going to write about sex make it believable and PLEASE, their is something called a plot that you can add to the sex next time...."
1,Only if you're lonely and have no other option...,This started off intriguing but quickly devolved to a waste of time - very skimpy and obvious plot - just an excuse to write sex scenes which actually became boring due to the repetiton - no basic male-female understanding - no insight into the main female's character - is Thea Devine actually a woman or a consortium of men writing under that name?
1,Silliest I've read in a while,"Not only was this book silly, it was practically one long sex scene. There was no plot, no characterization, no setting, no nothing--just one sex act after another. And half of the book was in italics, making it difficult to determine who was speaking or thinking. I was terribly disappointed in this book."
5,Great set,"I have shopped around quite a lot for something like this. My first choice was a different brand, wood made. Then, when I took it home, I realised my 3 years old daughter would be playing with a 1 year old friend who stills chews on the toys a lot. So I took back the wood ones - they can chip under the active action of a 1 year old teeth, the paint can be eaten and so on- and instead I purchased this set. It is a great buy, provides the kids the amusement and learning tools I was looking for, and is as safe as possible, and very easy to clean and disinfect. We had it for about 3 months now, and kids still play with it daily."
2,Disappointing from one of my favorite authors,"Hogan is possibly my favorite Sci-Fi author, but this one does not deliver at all. Had it not been Hogan, I would have quit halfway through, and I have rarely put down a book in my life - especially because I am picky about what I read in the first place.As mentioned in other reviews, it's not only confusing but there is just no compelling story here. Even though we're seeing some familiar characters from previous books, there's nothing I really care about in the story. I don't care about Jevlenese being taken over, I have no investment in them. Nothing is really threatening the main characters until very late in the story - too late for you to care.And the people we are supposed to care about are not likable. The new female character introduced is not compelling either.I SO wanted to like this book, and I struggled and pushed on, but I was only relieved when it was done, not satisfied. Skip this one and stick with Hogan's better stuff."
3,A Great History on Ancient Egypt,"The Oxford University Press, as many of you scholars already know, is famed for producing inimitable compendiums and texts that anyone interested in history or literature simply must own. And the have done it again with The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt. While the book is pretty small for encompassing an entire civilization of dynasties, gods, beliefs, and thousands of years of ancient happenings, it nevertheless somehow manages to do the job. With tons of black and white photos, as well as many colored plates, together with an interesting and detailed text. The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt tells the reader much more than they can ever hope to know about the most mysterious of ancient civilizations.Originally published on October 21st, 2002.Go to BookBanter [...]for over five hundred reviews and over forty exclusive author interviews, and more."
2,Not a helpful narrative,"Less a ""history"" of ancient Egypt than a collection of essays, presented in chronological order, on TOPICS in the history of ancient Egypt, each presented by a different academic. There is no central narrative presenting the story of Egypt, the topics and writing style are far too arcane for the average reader. I like to think I am reasonably intelligent and I know I am interested in this area, but reading these essays was painful...do British academics have no sense of how to make their material come alive? Perhaps they take it as a badge of honor that only other academics find their material enjoyable. It is as if these authors went out of there way to make this history as dry as possible -- and the disjointed nature of the book left me disappointed. A shame."
5,Hot Band in the Windy Place,What an awesome band! And the cover photography! Was that a trick camera? These guys rock!
5,These are great tweezers,"There isn't much you can say about tweezers. They either work or they don't. These ones work great, especially for the price."
1,Reincarnation: A Critical Examination Proves Nothing,"This book did not prove that reincarnation does not exist. I am a skeptic and I did not feel that the book make any good points. The author just stated how others might support reincarnation, but did not make an honest attempt to refute it. I thought it could have been written better. The points used to disprove reincarnation could have been used to 'disprove' anything such as God, heaven or hell."
3,Not Very Good,"This is not a very good movie. It is also not a lesbian movie so it is mis-categorized. The entire movie revolves around two former band mates/friends who are meeting again for the first time in years. They catch up on their lives since they've been apart while both struggling to remain sober. Both women also appear to be straight until one kiss between Vic and another woman. That was the closest the movie got to ""Gay and Lesbian"", hence why I say it was mis-categorized."
4,A must read if you want to attact quality women,"This book completly filled in where how to succeed with women left off, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their ""inner game"" with women."
3,Hip Girl,"This is about how you can mix in one thing hip-hop, funk and kind of jazz that is played by big-Candy-girl. No nostalgie themes like in previous Dulfer's works, the album is full of ""drinky"" optimism, but... not anyone will like it. Saxophone themes are mostly sad and quiet, but here you'll hear traditional ""a-ha, a-ha""'s by rap singers and other funky surprises from Candy. It can be said that arrangements are also not so good."
3,Be careful what you order.,This item looked good. I thought it was the english/spanish version when I ordered. They look so much alike. That is deceiving. The author should not create covers so identical. I was very disappointed. Be careful when you order.
5,Everything you need to know about magick!,"If you are searching for a shortway to become a magician, please skip this review and do not read this book.When you start reading this book, you know it will be your long-term friend, and that only you will know when it is time to read the next chapter. There are not grimories, not spells, but Practice of Magic enlist everything you need to learn. There are simple exercises to perform daily until you master them!"
1,Is this some kind of joke?,"Don't get me wrong: This movie is fantastic!Great script - wonderful acting (especially by Brad Dourif), awesome action, but 99 mins?What happenend to the other 12 mins? I have seen the short version - some important key scenes are missing in it.So when do they bring out the movie on DVD in the complete version? I hope soon - because my tape is nearly worn out ...."
2,Death Machine,"The DVD that was sent to me was in really bad condition. I don't know if it was because of the sender or the carrier, but it had a crack in the disk. I dont know what we can do about this but i would like to try."
4,Theory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy,"Great information. Hard to read in the beginning, but gets easier. Yalom uses a lot of detail to describe the inner-workings of group therapy and its purpose."
2,yalom,didn't like the book. we never used it in class. it looks like fireworks making the cover too busy. i didn't find the info useful
5,A glowing novel,"This is the first book I've read in longer than I can remember that made tears just stream down my cheeks. But mixed with the sadness was so much joy. Barbara Samuels writes about family, food, love, motherhood, and the joys and sorrows of balancing all the roles that come with being a woman with wit, tenderness, and shattering honesty. The genuineness of the writing and the universal truths that this book explores lift it far above your average ""women's fiction"" novel. I never once felt like my emotions were being manipulated. It's only March, but I'm already placing NO PLACE LIKE HOME at the top of my Favorite Books of the Year list."
2,The good and the bad,"I read the sample on Kindle and thought those first pages were marvelous--so I bought the entire book. The characters were wonderfully exciting and different and had such depth. The ending had me in tears--which seldom happens. It was wonderful.Sadly, there was a middle which was slow and repetitive. Okay, she was worried about her son--over and over and over. Okay, her father wasn't speaking to her and that broke her heart--over and over and over. Okay, Michael's (and Malachi's) father did a terrbile thing, but we hear about how this has ruined Malachi over and over and over--get counseling!!!!! Either Ms. Samuel didn't trust her readers to understand the plot OR she needed more words. Where was the editor?"
2,Letdown,"I must admit to being letdown by this CD. While I am all for artists expanding their horizons this one does not come across as Alison expanding hers as much as it does her contracting them. As pop goes it is clearly better than 99% of the stuff that gets played on commercial radio, but the majesty of her earlier work just isn't as evident here."
5,Sit back and enjoy...One of her best!!!!!!,Thoroughly enjoying it. I've listened to it now about 10 times. The first time was great and it is getting better each time. Be ready to love it!!!
2,Latest album a dissapointment.,"Great album title! I agree with Mr. Selhorst. Bluegrass has lost, hopefully only temporarily, one of it's greatest artists. I find this music dull, and expressing a small range of emotion. It holds few surprises for this listener."
4,Check this one out....,"""Forget About It"" is worth remembering. I have everything of Alison's but ""So Long, So Wrong"" . I heard that at a listening station and the snippets didn't grab me. This album evokes the haunting beauty of songs such as ""Last Love Letter"" and ""Teardrops Will Kiss the Morning Dew"". It's pretty mellow - a nice change of pace from today's country music. Settle back with a glass of wine and be drawn into this one!"
5,Always an experience!,"I've been a fan of Alison Krauss since 1995, and every album I've heard packs an emotional punch. This one is no exception. Whether she's belting out a heartfelt plea to her friend/lover to stay with her or she's whispering about a broken heart, you'll be pulled in by the powerful voice and lyrics."
2,Alison as a lounge act?,"I remember with almost equal disappointment when Linda Ronstadt abandoned her folk rock roots and started singing torch songs. It was great for the torchy crowd, but disappointing for those of us who remember the Stone Ponies with some fondness.So it is with this latest Alison Krauss CD. Too many jazz chords, too many ""strings"" and not enough fiddles. And unlike Linda Ronstadt's record, these aren't even particularly good songs. Just average. Everything from the photography on the cover to the arrangements is just too self-consciously crossover.Unfortunately for those of us whom Alison amazed with her bluegrass albums, this will probably be a great seller and encourge her to do more of the same. That leaves Lynn Morris and Claire Lynch to listen to, and I recommend the latest from both of them more highly than this new one from Alison."
2,Pop not bluegrass,"A disappointment. Does not bear repeated listening. I thought the point of Alison's sticking with Rounder was so that she didn't have to churn out the stuff you can hear on your local country FM station. If you want bluegrass, buy Dolly Parton's The Grass is Blue."
5,Beautiful,"This is our first Allison Krauss CD...It WILL NOT be our last. From the first song, this CD captivates you. Her voice and style touch you. I can't wait to find the next one we will get!"
5,Arrived in perfect condition,"I was hesitant to order after reading some of the reviews of damaged refrigerators. The refrigerator arrived in perfect condition and has been plugged in for three days now. I had it delivered directly to my office, paid nothing for shipping through Prime and feel I got a great deal. It is absolutely silent. I think it's a great little fridge for the price."
5,Fun With Two Glass Plates,Painting the plates is a fun activity because you can be creative. The only problem is that you have to be careful or they could crack or break.
5,"The Best Of The B-17, Flying Fortress books","This book is a ""must have"" for any collector of air combat books. The best of the best. Excellent collections of factual stories. Completely entertaining. If you can't buy it look for it in a good public library and enjoy. Then try to buy it for your private library. BOB STANE President B-17 Combat Crewmen & Wingmen Pasadena, California"
5,It's About Time!!!!!!,"This is the album we as fans have waited all to long for. I really don't for the life of me understand any of the negative reviews. Steve Augeri will soon make everyone forget Steve Perry. This is the best Journey album since Frontiers. From song to song this is a masterpiece!!! I can only wish Perry the best, so long pal! Oh Yeah, if you have any doubts about the live shows, don't worry Steve Augeri is unbelievable, I have already seen them twice!!! Hold on,to your seats. Welcome Back Guys!!!!!"
2,Stick to the classics.........,This could of been good but their new singer Steve Augeri does not have the vocal power to sing these songs and he is a very weak version of the great Steve Perry nuff said.
1,not the same journey,"While I can agree that Steve A. does have a good voice...I can't get past the fact that he sounds like some Steve Perry wannabe, who is desperately trying to mimic his voice. I was a huge journey fan from the beginning and really tried to give Steve A. a chance, but I guess once you get used to the excellence that is Steve Perry, some mediocre copycat singer simply won't do! I don't recommend this album if you're someone who loves Steve Perry, unless you can over look the poor attempt at copying."
2,Decent Songwriting...Lukewarm Delivery,"I purchased this album after hearing the band's Greatest Hits album. My interest had been sparked and I was curious to see what type of music the band was making these days. I was pleased to see that they hadn't strayed from their perfect blend of guitars and keys. The songs were okay...just okay. It was basically a collection of filler without one prominent hit. I almost got the feeling that Journey, like so many other veteran bands out there trying to find their place in this ugly rock scene we have today, were trying to hard to write a hit. The new singer was okay but not outstanding. He kindof sounded like a mix of John Waite and Steve Perry."
5,Back on top,The guys have come back with a very good cd. The us version i heard will have a few more rockers....Ron
3,"The body is there, the soul is gone.","Seeing VH1's ""Behind the Music"" prompted me to buy this album. Yes, Steve Augeri sounds like Steve Perry. But it seemed like an impressionist doing an imitation of Perry. Now Journey sounds like a tribute band to itself. They sound more or less the same, but I come away without that feeling that I used to get (and still do) from their other albums. I would recommend ""Trial by Fire"" over this any day."
2,Inferior product,"I've had several brands of truffle oil, and think that this one is probably one of the worst. Poor quality oil, very bland, hardly any aroma at all. Won't be buying this one again..."
5,Xtatic,"Machel and Xtatic has one of the best soca CD's around, do not hesitate to purchase it. Every track is a hit."
1,Defective,"I wasn't that happy with this waffle maker from the start, but when it broke after a couple of uses I was pretty disappointed. No luck getting Cuisinart to honor their guarantee, either. I'd skip this one."
2,Cuisinart round waffle maker,"I have only used this waffle maker once. And I have noticed some problems. The Cuisinart round waffle maker seems to be a bit cheap, the hinge connection seems like it will break easily, and it cooks a little fast. The cooking is also un-even, some parts on the waffles are burnt and some parts are not even cooked! I know it is very hard to try to find a classic round waffle maker besides this one. Overall, this seems to suffice enough for my needs."
5,Old type waffle maker,I wanted to purchase an old type waffle iron. I do not like thick waffles for breakfast. They are perfect if you want to put fruit on them.This waffle maker does a great job. It is easy to use and works perfectly.This is a brand with a great reputation so you will not be disappointed.
3,Cuisinart Round Classic Waffle Maker,"This waffle maker is certainly fast and easy - however the grids are shallower than the waffle irons I grew up with, so the waffles aren't as high and don't have as much surface area to get crispy. The lid is wobbly - definitely could use a redesign on the hinge.It was cheap, so its fine for my needs."
4,Does what its suppose to...,Some of the negative reviews of this product made me skeptical at first when deciding to purchase. But it works great and is a good value for the price.
2,"Good on paper, but small in real life","I was excited about this waffle maker because I really like the thinner waffles (not belgian style). I'm also a big fan of the square waffles so I was eager to try it out. However, I was really surprised by how small it was! The waffles are tiny and would take much too long to make for hungry cyclists, so I'm returning it. I've learned my lesson and will buy waffle makers in person from now on to see what size it actually is before buying."
1,Worst Product I have Ever Used,"I would have rated this minus stars had that been an option. I have been using the same recipe (beaten egg whites folded into batter) for waffles for 33 years--the last 5 with a similar Cuisinart waffle iron which failed two weeks ago. I immediately replaced the failed waffle iron with what I thought was a similar product. No matter what I try, the waffles stick. After seven attempts interspersed with cleaning, reheating, sometimes trying to grease the grids (which you are not supposed to do) sometimes not and various temperature settings, I give up. This product simply stinks."
3,3 Start Item,"I think that this Waffle Iron is less than perfect, not nearly as good as my old one that lasted almost 20 years. It does not cook evenly after several tries. This is the 3rd one I have tried and none seem to be able to cook evenly."
5,Love it!!,This waffle maker is so easy to use and wipes clean so easily!! I use cooking spray but that's just me. You can probably use it just fine without the spray. I Highly recommend this product!!
5,Cuisinart WMRCA Round Waffle Maker,"I've had others, the is very good. The temperature gauge is a bit flimsy, but is accurate. Don't overfill with batter!"
5,Waffle Fool,"Great find. Hard to find a classic waffle maker anymore. Really like the selection lever, cleans well, and makes great classic waffles."
3,Good basic waffle iron,This is a good basic waffle iron. The only problem I have with it is the browning control. It seems to be too flimsy. I feel it is going to fall off at any time.
5,Sunday morning staple,"Pancakes used to be the Sunday morning breakfast here, now it is waffles. Cuts prep time in half or better and clean up time is nearly non-existent. Ten minutes tops for 4 golden waffles on the table and better than I've had at any restaurant. Highly recommended. For a large family a double iron would probably be better, but for a family of two or three I would say this can't be beat."
1,Horrible waffle maker from day one.,"This waffle maker is not good quality all around. First, the switch to make it lighter or darker is very unstable. You never know what you are going to get. Second, how do you handwash the thing without getting water in the electronics? Third, the waffle ALWAYS sticks to it so I have to scrape it off, often times breaking the waffle which ends up in throwing it out and starting over. I can use spray...but if I forget to use spray, forget about it. I've had this for a few years and it's just completely fallen apart. It's not durable and just not a good product. I don't recommend this product."
1,not so good,"Not so good. The batter stuck to the grids and had to pry the stuff off, I waited for the green light too. Tried oil on the grids and the same problem existed. Will give it another try if it doesn't work back to the frozen waffles at the super market."
1,WORST. WAFFLE. MAKER. EVER.,"This is, hands down, the most frustrating product I've ever owned in my life. When it first arrived, I was a little put off by the looseness of the hinge in the back because it wobbles every time you move the lid. I actually almost returned it, but after seeing another reviewer said the same thing, I figured they were probably all like that. The first couple uses, were fine. I haven't used it much at all in the last month and a half that I've owned it. But, after the initial couple uses, every single waffle I've made has stuck. To the point where all my waffles split in half and I have to dig them out. And yes, I do put oil in my waffle batter. The description says it is NON STICK, I shouldn't have to put cooking oil. I am furious with this product, which is now ruined and I have to throw it away now because it is beyond the point of being cleaned and uses. Essentially, I there $40 down the drain and my kids, who love waffles, are going to be devastated."
1,Horrible--broke after 3 weeks,This waffle iron gave out after just 3 weeks of use. It also to be 'finicky' while it did work. A given setting did not work throughout a session (i.e. a '3' setting would have to be shifted to get the desired doneness).Don't buy this.
1,Bad news for waffle lovers,"Based on my experiences and the other reviews, it seems one must be lucky to get a waffle maker that works. The Cuisinart WMR-CA Round Classic Waffle Maker I received was a disaster from the very first waffle.On our first try, the waffle split neatly in half when we tried to open the waffle maker and stuck to the griddles. We carefully peeled it off, cleaned the griddles, seasoned them with cooking oil, and tried again. Waffle #2 was burnt to a crisp and raw inside. Waffle #3 was a return of waffle #1. We used a faithful old Black & Decker for almost 20 years before it wore out with never a failure, so we're hardly waffle novices. I believe that some people may have gotten waffle makers that worked, but ours wasn't among them.I'd say if you have plenty of time and don't mind packaging up returns and taking them to the post office, go ahead and order one. You might get lucky. Otherwise, keep looking. This waffle maker isn't worth the effort."
1,Disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this waffle iron just before Christmas with the intent of having a brunch with 4 other couples. Everything went as planed for the first 6 waffles. Then everything went awry. The waffles started sticking and became darker so we went to turn down the heat adjust and it litterer came off in my hand and the metal it was attached to disappeared inside. Could not continue making waffles. Very disappointed with product. Will look for a better one made by someone else.
1,just stopped working,"This waffle maker worked great until the 3-year warranty expired (of course). After 3 1/2 years with no problems, it just went dead in the middle of cooking a waffle!"
1,"Great waffles, until it breaks","We have owned two of these. They make perfect waffles, as many of the reviews have said. The problem is that the top handle becomes loose. It is attached by scres that have their heads inside the top of the waffle maker. Once they become loose there is no way to re-tighten the handle. Eventually it just falls off. Our first one died within the warranty period. The second one lasted until just beyond the warranty period. It is a stupid design flaw on an otherwise wonderful product."
4,"May call for a little adjustment, but it's good","This waffle iron cooks an excellent light thin waffle. I've enjoyed having it, and I recommend it.There is one possible misunderstanding that caused me a bit of trouble at first, so I'll warn you. If you have been using a waffle iron where the best indicator that the waffle is done is that it stops steaming, you may end up with the waffles made in this one being a bit overdone and a bit hard. Because the waffles are not at all thick, the cooking is very quick; and the steam may still be there when the waffle should be removed. The best method I have found is to wait for the ready light (green) to go on and then remove the waffle fairly promptly; it will be cooked and crisp and tender.For that reason, I wish that the lights were elevated a bit so I, sitting at the table, could look at the waffle iron, sitting on the countertop, and see the color of the light; but that's just me--if I'm sitting I like to stay that way as much as possible."
3,Where's the Magic?,"I am in the process of reading Flight... and I think that Misty is out of touch with some real character development. Everything always turns up roses in this novel, and it's a bit boring. What happened to the suspense and chances of death in the Arrows Trillogy? These characters are a bit cookie-cutter for me, but I love the gryphons who always are fresh, so I will read on. zhai'helluva!"
2,Disappointing for Mercedes Lackey,"I'm sorry to say that I consider this the worst book Misty has written, bar none. I felt no sense of urgency until I was approximately 7/8ths of the way through the book, and when a conflict *finally* arrived, it and the ending were terribly predictable. I'd recommend this book for people like myself who are in love with Valdemar and can't stand the thought of missing a single tidbit, but non-Misty fans would probably hate it. If you've never read any of the Valdemar books, go for the ""Last Herald Mage"" trilogy - don't bother with this one unless you become addicted. Misty can do much better than this!"
3,for mercedes lackey- so/ so,"I thought this book was a little disappointing for her. I've read every other book in the Valdemar series, except the one before this. By the end of Owlsight, I could guess exactly what happened in Owlflight. It is a decent story, but it read like a YA book to me, not an adult novel. It felt like it was designed for early teenage girls, not the general public.Also, I read the synopsis on this site, I didn't notice anything about his parents. Maybe that's in the next book?"
1,Not for tall people,"I am 6' 5"" and find this chair extremely uncomfortable. My feet hang off the end of the chair from about my mid calf down, causing loss of circulation. This makes the chair unbearable for more than 10 minutes or so.Chair has very little padding a several metal cross bars that are painful to lie on.The heating element never worked for me.The vibrating massage elements have gone out over time. It started with 10 separate vibration points. After a year or so, only about 2 work anymore.I would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,Unsung Hero Gets His Story Told,"This book can almost be read at one sitting. It is the little known story of Captain Ripley, USMC, who assisted by an Army officer and some ARVN Marines blew the bridge at Dong Ha, stalling an NVA armored invasion of the Republic of Vietnam in 1972. Great story of individual heroism and courage in the face of strong enemy fire. Captain Ripley is just one of those guys who gets things done. Working alone under the bridge with enemy bullets pinging all around him, swinging arm to arm like on the horizontal ladder in Basic Training, he places the explosive charges and detonates them before the NVA tanks can get over the bridge. The NVA did not try such a move again until 1975, some 3 years later. One man CAN make a difference. My only surprise is that he was awarded a Navy Cross instead of a CMH for his exploits. Well worth the read. Buy it."
4,Excellent readings,"This book is worth getting for the readings alone. They are interesting, varied and engaging despite the limited vocabulary that could be used at this point. I think the intended audience is high school and college students, but the readings are entirely appropriate for a bright eight- or nine-year-old.The rest -- the instruction per se and the exercises -- are all right, nothing remarkable but not bad either. The grammar is presented adequately but not encyclopedically; there's certainly enough there for the self-teaching student to figure out the readings.Everything I've just said also goes for level 2."
4,Good basic book,This is a good basic book for learning Hebrew. Interesting stories and good exercises. I wish it had more of a dictionary.
2,Level one course?,"After reading the glowing reviews on this book, I thought it would be a great introductory text for learning Hebrew. However, when I opened the book I was sorely disappointed. Chapter one starts out with a story written in Hebrew. If I knew Hebrew, I wouldn't need this book. But the author assumes you know 150 Hebrew words including: father, eats, mother, says, I, you, please, school, son, morning, chalk, garden, window, etc. It's common practice in language books to skip over words that are obvious cognates, but since Hebrew has no relationship with English, the only cognates are those words that have become a part of our language due to religion such as seraph and hallelujah. This is the only level one language book I've ever seen that makes such large assumptions about the readers knowledge of a language."
5,French Revolution period piece,This is extremely well done. Costumes are excellent and well as the props settings and various scenes. It was the movie that made seek out a read Retif de la Bretonne. The movie takes several very strong and strictly in character persons and places them together on the coach following the fleeing King and Queen. I would say this is a must have for anyone interested in the French Revolution. I cant wait for this to be out on DVD.
4,Pretty good bag!,"Looked at quite a few roof bags on the internet and chose this one. Read most reviews and even though others complained about not being ""water-proof"", opted for this one anyway (believe pkg. says ""weather-resistant""). Have only used once and was pretty pleased with it overall. Only recommendation to the the manufacturer would be to use a better plastic closure/buckle. Hauled quite a bit of camping stuff and used the expandable feature of the bag with no problems. Was more concerned about going over vehicles' recommended roof weight limit with all the room the bag had to offer. Looks sharp too!"
2,NOT waterproof,"This bag is sturdy, holds plenty and attaches securely to a roof rack, but contrary to the advertising, it is most definitely NOT waterproof. We have used it no more than a half-dozen times, but only the last time were we driving in extended, heavy rain. Our luggage and contents therein were soaked and there was a good deal of water pooled inside the carrier when we reached our destination. We'll continue to use it, but everything inside will be in supplemental waterproof bags!"
5,Great Book,"Oh, David! was a favorite of my now 13 year old son, so I bought it for my 2 year old Granddaughter. It quickly became her favorite and the hard cover makes it so she can carry it everywhere without tearing it up"
3,Cute graphics but no story,"Maybe I'm lazy, but I like for books to have more of a story than this book provides. The pictures in the book are very cute, but each page consists of only a few words like ""Hold Still David"" and I just make up the story of what's going on with the picture. No big deal, but this is more of a picture book and isn't one of my favorites."
5,identify,Preschoolers can idenify with David because they have similar experiences at home. The students enjoy his antics alot. Thank you.
4,Good--but not their best stuff,"The Alk3's new ep delivers pretty well. Most memorable song would have to be ""Bleeder"". The first and second songs are both good as well--there is something that bothers me about the fourth track. A solid release--I can't really recommend this ep or their ""For your Lungs only"" ep...both have one really solid song and the others are good, but not great."
4,Bargain Buy,"Buying from Amazon was cheapest price especially with free shipping. Stepped up for more power per channel. Stayed in the Sony family. (Previous Sony surround, output to center speaker quit) Dislike the speaker hook ups in back, difficult to attach speaker wires and screw down connections. Overall happy with purchase."
4,Better than most,"I am an audiophile that believes most modern amplifiers, such as this Sony, produce good sound. Perhaps not as good as some of the esoteric designs but better than merely acceptable. So what you are paying for in almost any receiver purchase are features and power. This amp has convenience and a well designed remote. That is the sum total of features. If that is all you need and the power, which will adequately fill most any residential room (unless you like your movies at 110 db), is appropriate for you, you can buy this receiver confident that it will give good service. You will note that I do not mention the AM/FM radio section. I have never tested it because the 6 channel movie sound is what I wanted and what I use. I will leave the radio review to someone to whom it is important."
5,"Finished it yesterday, want to re-read it today.","If you enjoy clear prose, buy this book. If dry textbooks make you yearn for some time with a great humanist pondering the big questions of where we come from and why violence and ignorance so often seem to eclipse everything worthwhile, buy this book. This book is good company, and not just for the young readers it was originally intended for. Also, the slim paragraph on Joan of Arc alone is worth the price of admission... And for a visual person like myself, the crisp woodcut-style illustrations and clean typography complement the keen prose to make the volume irresistible."
3,Simple understanding,"A very good book for simple understanding. However, the language used is culturally european, not sure at what age one can read it, as universal systems in formal education not longer exists. Each country has it's own parameters, mostly very low. With acces for Internet, the book has limitations as concentration in reading diminishes. Maybe good for the young, but better for adults!Ina Ouang"
2,April fool,"I wanted to give a gift to my neighbour for a special day. He is a musician, so I ordered a violin which never reached in my hand, the purchase was canceled and return the money. So I very much dissopointed."
5,Great violin for the price,"I actually bought this violin three years ago with the intentions of learning to play it. The need to take some college courses for my job took a lot of time away from me, and I packed the violin away for a while.At the beginning of this year, 2008, I was free of college classes, and it was time to take violin lessons! My instructor was impressed with the price I paid for this violin. He thought I paid at least $200. I had similar comments when I took it to a music store to get a string replaced.It is a great beginner's violin, well worth its price. I am sure one day I will upgrade to a more expensive violin, but this one will hold many memories and the enjoyment of learning something I have always wanted to do.I recommend this violin for any beginner, student or adult. It is made well for its price. I have been very pleased with it from the first time I touched the bow to the strings. Great violin for its price!"
4,Not a bad little instrument,"I was a little hesitant about buying this instrument. I was worried that the quality of the sound would not be good. However, after some minor adjustments, I was quite pleasently surprised by its tone. Not only me, but the lutheir, who did the minor repairs, even mentioned that it had a very nice sound.I will mention that I did have to have the sound post cut and fitted to the violin. This made a difference in the quality of sound. I also had to have the bridge cut, to prevent the strings from slipping.I would definitly recommend this violin as a starter instrument, and maybe even for intermediate level students."
2,Maybe mine is defective?,"I purchased this waffle maker based on the positive reviews written here. I made ten waffles with it - following all instructions - and not one was cooked properly. The top never cooked or took on any color. Once I put enough batter in so it overflowed (to make sure I was using enough to get it up into the top grids), but the top side never cooked well at all. The bottom side was perfect, but the top never browned."
1,i dont know what to say,LL has always been known for his love and showing off his six pack body. but i remember one time there was a time where LL actually knew how to rap. o well he cant anymore thats why bubble gum club music like this deserves a 1 star
2,The DEFiniton is...well....it might be time to retire,"LL Cool J hits his 11th album with ""The DEFinition""...more of the same with mostly love songs and such. There were only three tracks I was diggin':HushCan't Explain ItEvery SipMost of the beats were intolerable as LL focuses on the same ol' same ol'. Sorry LL, but the dictionary can't find a good DEFinition for this album..."
3,What? (My Name is O.I.),"Headsprung was a alright song which makes up the album, and Feel The Beat was pretty good too, but ever since his album Phenomenon, this man has beenn feminant and girl-addicted. All he ever talks about his partying with girls and love songs. My favorite LL song was I Shot Ya Remix, even though it dissed 2pa, the song had a very good beat and tune, and he was gangsta when that song was recorded (or rather that was the time he tried to be gangsta. Feel The Beat and Headsprung are good tunes but everything else is bullshizzle....he acts to damn soft all the time. If you are just starting to listen to LL, get his early six albums, and maybe the G.O.A.T album."
2,um what?,i got this expecting 12 inch leads like normal but no they were half that and the wire was smaller than 18 awg... way to small for the relay's rated current. I went to my local electronics surplus store and bought one with 12 inch leads and 16 awg wire for all of $2.65
1,Misleading Description,Description says the socket has 3 14ga wires and 2 18ga. All wires are 18ga or maybe even 20ga. The heavy insulation gives the illusion that the wiring is heavy duty. These are for light duty only. Just more cheap Chinese junk.
2,It's ok,"The wires are way too small for the amperage it allows. I ended up sticking it in my toolbox to be used later. I bought 10gauge wires, some ends, and attached the wires directly to the relay."
3,"A little tight, but did the job","The price was right, so I can't complain too much. This did the job but the quality was a little cheap and the connectors were a little on the tight side. All of that said, I would buy this product again."
4,This is Baywatch when it was good!,I remember this season from when it was on NBC. Back then this it was a good show once it went into syndication it got crazy. If you want to see Baywatch the way it was originally intended watch this season. The real season one.
2,Not Expedition,"My friend has this and it works great. Unfortunately, it does not work with a Ford Expedition or any vehicle with plastic body moldings at the bottom of the door."
5,Different ideas,"It is soft and thick that makes more comfortable. I have no idea about levels. I only use during mentual period during bedtime for one or two nights due to heavy flow. It complete stay in and not let it leak out and stay in it. It prevents not get stained on clothes,blanket and sheets and not have to worry about stained everything so it helps protect not let it stained or leak out. So it is up to you with different ideas that what is best for you to use for any reasons to protect something."
5,Nice,The internet is the way to go for college text books. I like how you can sell them back when you are done.
5,Wonderful illustrations great beginning reader book!,"Wonderful use of humor, simple vocabulary and charming illustrations. As a former teacher, I HIGHLY recommend this little book. My 3 1/2 year old grandson was enchanted and literally laughed until he was weak."
2,"Okay, but...","What API doesn't tell you as that you cannot use a long electrical extension cord with this bath. I only found out after replacing my extension cord, buying a voltage indicator, and finally calling the company."
3,"Best Title ever, but doesn't back it up","So after 7 years off, the Prodigy really needed to stand up some hardcore music. With a title as ultimately hardcore awesome as ""Always Outnumbered Never Outgunned"" I thought this CD would decimate all, unfortunately I was mistaken.It's a fairly solid techno CD, the beats are good, the samples and vocal samples are put together in perfect Liam Howlett manners that remind me of Jilted Generation, but without that gargoyle Flint fronting his beats, the sound is somewhat empty. Liam Gallagher of Oasis tries his hardest on his track, but it's just not the same."
1,Hard to believe,This is the Prodigy? How far they have fallen! This album is truly one of the worst that I have ever heard. It is a compilation of random discordant sounds with absolutely no cohesiveness or inspired artistry that I have come to expect. I had visions of them in the studio just cranking out this garbage in record time so they could fulfil contractual obligations and get back to lounging by the pool. This is NOT the Prodigy. Check out what they can really do when they are still hungry. Music For The Jilted Generation (Their best) and The Fat Of The Land are far superior in every aspect. Don't waste your time on this hasty and experimental junk. Goodbye Prodigy... It was fun while it lasted!
2,Not what I expected,"""Music for the Jilted Generation"" is a milestone in techno music. ""The Fat of the Land"" is not a bad album. However, with this album the Prodigy's music has definitely changed direction and I don't like where it's heading. The tracks on this album are unexciting and not innovative. Prodigy will never make another MFTJG album."
1,Blech :p,"After Fat of the Land, I was expecting something extraordinary....I kept flipping from one song to another waiting for something with phat bass, heavy rhythms and hard quitar and came up with nothing but rubbish....You can listen to the excerpts for yourself and judge...I'm very disappointed!"
1,You must forget how good was the past of Prodigy,"Recommendation : Don't follow any reviews on the net. Don't believe the crowd of liars. ""Revolution in techno music"" . Ha. It's revolution for those, who are not familiar with earlier Prodigy. Every song is worse than a previous one. Sound's like CC Catch and DJ Bobo decided to create synthesized rap&dance of 80's. I found a review "" you want to hear, how the 3rd world war sounds like? It's Prodigy'2004"" . Absolute fake. Sorry beying so angry. I was waiting for something Prodigy was able to create... The album put my face down to the dirt. Anyway, buy the album. Listen many many times. And forget what you kow about Prodigy. It's primitive now. Something like this creates teenagers with Ejay."
3,Is this their first demo or the long awaited follow-up???,"Dissapointing come-back after 7 years, sounds more like a B-sides compilation of Fat of the land to me. Only 5 good songs, in the following order:1. Shoot Down 9,5/102. Girls 9/103. The Way It Is 8,5/104. Action Radar 8/105. Spitfire 7/10and maybe Memphis Bells (6,5/10), but what the heck did Liam had in his drugged mind when making dull tracks leading nowhere as Pheonix and Medusas Path? And then the filler You'll be Under MY Wheels, it's like he didn't take the the time to mix 'em. I heard better demos than this!If you want a rating of the other dull tracks :)Wake up Call 6,5/10Get Up Get Off 5,5/10Hotride 5/10You'll be under my wheels 4,5/10Medusas' Path 4/10Pheonix 2/10Overall 2,5 stars ==> so 3stars"
4,"Again, if 4.5 was an option...","Ok so I really do enjoy this album. I really do. It's a complete step in the right direction after the frantic and somewhat uninspired ""Fat of the Land"".This album is fast-paced, crunchy, and does everything right to keep me interested and satisfied.My favorite track right now is Hotride, the female's vocals being wonderfully deviant and not beautiful at all, but fitting right in with the crunchiness of the track. Other tracks of mention include the single, ""Girls"", and ""Memphis Belles"".The problem with the disc that I had overall is that it tends to flow into itself, and if you are using it as background music it becomes monotonous. You have to listen to it, really listen, to enjoy it all the way through.Definitely give this disc a try."
5,Fantastic! And the dogs liked it too.,"I have only made 1 recipe from this book but I am SOLD. The recipe was easy to follow, easy to make, & the dogs Love the bones. I can't wait to make the next batch."
5,Pleasing the Poodle Palate...,"is exactly what the recipes in this book did! The bones are the perfect size for small training treats for any dog, and the recipes lend themselves well to adaptation (a batch of apple doggie bones, based on the veggie bone recipe but substituting two cups of grated apples for the veggies, pure unsweetened apple juice for the water, and with the addition of 1/4 c. molasses) are baking in the oven as I write this. My Standard Poodle knows what the cookie cutter looks like; once she sees the bones go in the oven, she walks by it every few minutes to check their progress and gives me beseeching looks if they're not ready...Both my dogs (and many of my friends' and coworkers' dogs) give this book their enthuiastic howl of approval!"
5,Great gift-giving book for the pooch lover in your life!,"Give them this book, and the dogs will be drooling! We use this book constantly for our own dog, and his friends! Recipes are easy, not one dog has complained yet! I do taste test the treats, and wow, very edible and delicious. Any dog would be so lucky to have a human in their life with this book!"
4,good recipies,This book contains recipes with ingredients that could be found at most grocery stores. The only down side is that the provided dog bone cookie cutter would make bones too big for little dogs.
4,One of the sadest plays,This is a short play written so well. It is all about three different families in a special care centre for people with cancer. They are all describing how the feel and what they are going through. This is so sad because it makes you wonder why we are alive and how we take advantage of everyday life!
1,"really, really awful","Unlike the other reviewers, i think there is a good reason to watch this film, and that is just to be able to say that you watched Hugh Grant's worst movie ever, which i am sure he (grant) must be absurdly embarrassed about. i suppose the film is supposed to be something about how dreams might just be reality (the closing quotation), and i guess in a weird way, it is kind of like a dream, in that nothing makes sense. characters cross paths, but there is no clear conflict, no clear climax, just lots of different characters thrown into scenes that make absolutely no dramatic sense."
1,"It is not a complete product, as shown in picture.","They must change the picture and product description. It is misleading, as it is not complete product to mount the projector as shown with mounted projector. Wasted time and effort for me, and turned out much more expensive than I thought since I had to order more parts separately to be able to mount it."
4,Really pleased,"We purchased this for our home theater as we have a drop ceiling and wanted the projector at the back of our room anyway. It's very easy to install and is incredibly strong. We have the Sanyo PRZ2000 and it easily handles it's weight. There was a problem with the carriage bolt that attaches to the actual mounting extension and the company sent us another bolt very quickly, but it was defective as well. We took the bolt to Home Depot and for $1.49 got a replacement. We are thrilled with this mounting arm and used it with this.Black Precision Gear Projector Mount (PRG-UNV)"
2,THE FIRE should have stayed below !!!!!!!!!!,"My GOD!!! What is this bonus track doing in this remaster?? THis is, simply put, the worst thing I've ever heard by Judas Priest!! A drum machine, I can't believe!! The rest of the album we all know, of course, it's classic."
5,Best of the best,"One of the best rock-metal albums ever.It's as simple as that.Halford's vocals are absolutely stunning ,i consider this album as a vocal lesson for all singers!His voice ranges from high operatic to slow blues and angry metal screams.The sound of this album is way ahead of it's time paving the way for later metal bands."
5,Essential Priest Classic,"Stained Class is one of Judas Priest's best CD's. It contains Exciter - probably the best speed metal song out at that time. Saints In Hell - Black Sabbath worship done perfectly. Stained Class - the best misanthropic song ever, in my opinion. Heroes End - a tribute to fallen legends like Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin that asks ""Why do you have to die to be a hero."" Beyond the Realms Of Death - few can do ballads like Priest and this is one of thier best, also has one of Glenn Tipton's best guitar solos ever. Invader - awesome guitar sound effects at the start by KK Downing. Savage - makes a great case for modern man being savages. White Heat Red Hot - just a great classic metal tune."
5,API - 300 - 200 - watt Birdbath deicer.,"Did a lot of web research on this unit. This one had the most positive reviews. Also the very best warranty. Three years. Very well-made. All deicer's appear to require a fair amount of maintenance. Hard water can be a problem and a build up will void the warranty. Our town does have high concentrations of iron and lime. Vinegar is recommended when 1/32in of deposits are seen! They mention other specific remedies, I'll be using CLR. Happy new year!"
5,No Ice in My Bird Bath,This Bird Bath De-Icer does exactly what it claims to do...it keeps the ice out of the bird bath. The birds are happy and that makes me happy. I have not noticed any considerable jump in my energy bill as a result of using the de-icer.
4,Adorable and funny,"Priceless Moments"" is simply wonderful. This book has the feel of between a table art book and someone's home scrap book that has been meticulous put together. All the photos are black and white, printed on semi glossy paper between a high gloss hard cover.The book is be great fun for babies and adults alike."
4,Simply Charming!,The concept is close to perfect. This book is cute pictures of babies taken by amateur photographers and put together in a simple black and white semi glossy layout. All very delightful.
3,correction,"I must object to one reader-reviewer's description of Richard Olney's brother James as ""a capable but generally unremarkable academic."" Autobiography as a field of literary criticism did not exist before James Olney's landmark book, Metaphors of Self. As a writer, teacher, and organizer of dozens of conferences and institutes on autobiography, he has been the most dominant presence and most pervasive influence on others in the field he created, even those who disagree with him.And his brother Richard's book, while gossipy, is eloquent and charming."
4,A Good Book,Artemis Fowl is a 12 year old genius but he doens't use his brights for things that you my think he's criminal master mind. Artemis's plan is to combine human greed with fariy magic something know one has done before.I like how Eoin Collfer brings the fariy world to life with his descriptive words and magical imagination. My favorite part of the book is how he ends the story it's a great ending you have to read it.But he could have standed to write shorter chapters they were extremly long and that I did not like but other then that it was a great storyand you should read it!Kyle
3,I liked it,"Since I had heard so many people rave about this series, when I saw it on NetGalley, I thought it was worth a try.It took me some time to get into the book and then some more to understand what was going on.The writing style is a bit unfamiliar and also there is a plethora of things one should know. Since I don't read much paranormal, I'm ignorant of most things that a fairy and otherworldly creatures can do. This made for a difficult reading time for me.The best part of the book is towards the end when there is much action and less thinking involved. I enjoyed the various technological devices and tricks used by the characters and their clever thinking skills. This makes a keeps-you-on-your-toes kind of thriller because it wants you to concentrate, remember and think. I do like doing that sometimes but too much of it felt like a burden and not enjoyment.I'm not sure if I will pick up the next book in the series but we'll see."
5,Amazing!,"I lent this from a friend and read five times before giving it back. Equals and passes Harry Potter. Artemis and Butler are a unbreakable pair. This book is outstanding, buy it."
3,Refreshingly bright main character,"Mixed reviews held me back from reading this book for quite some time, despite my recent foray into juvenile literature. I have to say I have mixed feelings as well, though not for a lot of the reasons I've read (okay, people who say a 12-year-old criminal mastermind is just 'too farfetched' of an idea... did you notice the fairies and dwarves and trolls and the centaur? Oh, a 12-year old genius is too much to handle, but all of the fantasy creatures... no problem? Fiction, people... it's fiction. If I wanted 'real world' stuff I'd just leave the house!). Mostly I had a very hard time picturing a lot of the creatures (specifically the dirt-eating unhinged-jawed dwarf) and didn't have a great handle on the setting/technology/magic being described. But the action was good, and I did like a lot of the characters. So it gets a pretty middle-of-the road review, though I will read more in the series."
4,Perfect for the action/adventure reader!,"I got this book for my birthday and I like it.Although it has a little too many action sequences and too many characters and phrases to remember, it's a good read nevertheless.It makes acriminal turn into a hero type of book.Some things might sound scary or disgusting for smaller kids,it is kinda funny and it showsthat all people, no matter how tough they look, have some good inthem.It's a fairy tale adventure with a twist.There is some punching, kicking, a lot of criminal activity involved,so this bookis ideal for 8 and up year olds.It's a great read aloud for everybody.This book is kind of boring when it comes to the dialogue part. And the puns aren't that good.This book is aguaranteed good read for people who love a little adventure, a little action, and love to laugh out loud!"
5,the code,"can u belive how long it took me to decode all of the codes in this book? it took me only a month! ur saying that is long! for all the codes in this book, that is a short time! and i have a book report due on Wenndsday so i have no idea y im righting this!!!"
2,Artemis Fowl,"Artemis FowlCopyright 2000By: Eoin ColferPublished by: Schoolaltic ReadersI think the book Artemis fowl was ok. The main chacters are Artemis fowl, Butler, Caption Holy, and Commander Root. Artemis is like the master mind trying to steel a large sum of Gold. Butler is the lacky who does what Artemis tells him to, always has at least one weapon, and can kill a man without caring. Cuss he is like a major cime lord. Caption Holy is like a trouble maker, never flows the rules, and is always under Commander Roots skin. Commander Root is the commander of the Lcm, as a very sort temper, and thinks he isn't as old as he looks.This story would be ok for some reads. The only thing I don't like is the frist five chapters put you to sleep, the plot is easy to figure out, and the only really good chapter is chapter 9 or 10. Cuss the butler pulls of some major hand to hand commbat moves out.It all true I would not tell anyone to read this book."
2,Poo,Poo I hate it why bother writing a book about poo its terrible artemis fowl is fowl POO I had to read it for class and Im like poo im not reading this its poo
4,Not bad for a kids book - Harry Potter-esque.,"This is clearly a teen book and not aimed at adults, but I discovered it on a list of books for ""those who were going through Harry Potter withdrawals.""It isn't Harry Potter by any stretch of the imagination. And it isn't perfect. But it is very readable and with the exception of the over-the-top dwarf character (Mulch Diggums) it is constructed well enough that the story is fun and surprising.I've read through the third book now and have ordered the fourth. They are not great works of art, but certainly readable and worth buying."
4,I want fries,"Our book group read Artemis and here's what we thought: Ms. Lenza thought it's never been so cool to be an evil genius. It's incredible to watch Artemis stay one step ahead of all the ethereal world. Michael says Mulch's gaseous state has stuck me to the end of this book, and that's hard for a book to do. Victoria says 12 year old evil geniuses are cool. Artemis was very very very very.....Funny! Katrina says fortunatly Vlad is not here today, so in his words this book is WHEEEEEEEEEEEEE, GAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ANDDDDdd........ boom. Haha Iwant Fries!!"
2,I'd rather read a book about the fairies,"The actual main character (Artemis Fowl) was despicable. I doubt I will read anymore of these ""Foul"" books. I gave this two stars only because I really liked the main fairy Holly and had to finish the book to find out if her and her compadres were okay. The book should center around them instead of an unlikable snotwad like Artemis Fowl."
2,Comments on book,"The book starts rather nicely but soon loses its taste. One often has a fealing of self-repeating in the book and the writer loses the reader's interest not once.It is still, however, an original and mostly nicely written book."
2,Not the best book i have read- eniz,"I didn't think Eoin Colfer did a very good job with this book because it spent way too much time describing the scenery so much as the actual plot or characters. I have read much more interesting books than this. This book did have a great story, but the author didn't really use much rising action. He didn't really keep me waiting or anything. Eoin colfer could have done a much better job. I read this for readers workshop in class and I really hated having to open the book and start reading from where I left off. It had more action and became more interesting at the end, but I'm surprised people even get to the end and not abandon the book."
5,Another Amazing book,Another amazing Artemis Fowl book! These books are great for anyone to read from 9 year olds to adults! l can't wait to read the next book! If it's as good as this book I'm going to love it!
3,Er...,"I can't really say whether this book is good or bad. The character, Fowl is interesting, maybe a tad ""too smart"" by it seems to just be about technology and ammunition. The plot is weak, probably only created to support the tech. stuff. It totally looks as if Colfer wrote a book about warfare, then decided to turn it into a storybook by adding a floppy outline which doesn't even hold.After saying that, I must admit the descriptions are good, it helps you picture the characters, though it would be more exciting if Colfer decided to add in descriptions of Fowl and Butler bit by bit, changing it once in a while. He has this thing about repeating himself through the book.You can agree or disagree with me...I seriously don't care."
5,Good to Great!,"It takes a lot for me to like a book and I love the whole Artemis Fowl series! It has a lot of adventure, E.C. writes with such action an excitement, you just fall in love with the characters. It's amazing and I definetly recommend it to everybody!"
2,Could have been so much better.,"You can read the other reviews/synopses too see what the book's about. I thought that it was only okay, but could have stood for more details and character development. A 12-year-old criminal genius? Sounds interesting, but that's about as far as Colfer takes us. His mother's got problems (sad) but things getter better by the end (happy). The banter between Foaly and everyone he talks to is hokey. Thoughts/scenes aren't carried out for any length of description.If you've already read Nix's Sabriel books, Pullman's His Dark Materials triology, The Lord of the Rings trilogy and (of course) the Harry Potter books and you need a quick fantasy fix, then Artemis Fowl will get the job done. But you may be let down. I would recommend reading this only the fill the time until Nix's next book, Abhorsen, comes out."
