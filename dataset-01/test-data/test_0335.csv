1,God Awful,"I just took the A+ exams covering the 2001 objectives. If you can decipher the questions in this book, you will ace the exam with no problem. There are many inaccuracies in the text, and many of the questions are either poorly written or are very ambiguous. Rest assured, the CompTIA A+ exams have questions that are of much higher quality. Pass over this book - it probably will confuse you more than it will help you."
3,No replacement parts for the older model,"I bought the 4.1 model of the Neuton mower and have used it for a number of years. I like the light weight, foldable features and the trimmer edger. Unfortunately I have had to replace the trimmer because it is easily damaged, sticking out in front like it does. The replacement is now hanging on by a thread and I wanted to order another replacement but the company does not make the mower any longer and has no replacement parts. I can understand discontinuing a model, but to also stop producing replacement parts is ludicrous. I now have a mower with two batteries. but can't use the trimmer.edger and will have to buy one. The live chat operator told me that they still have replacement batteries and technical support, a lot of good that does."
3,another new battery?,"I bought the DR battery powered lawn mower seven years ago. I love everything about it except one thing. For the THIRD time I have to buy a new battery!! I have a very small yard and we had a terrible drought this year so I have only used the mower 3 times this summer. Yet the battery I bought last summer is dead already... For a $90.00 battery I do not feel like I got my moneys worth. Great mower, bad battery..."
4,Not bad for a green alternative,"It's wonderful not to have to store gasoline on the premises, the mower is quiet, and thank goodness, it's easy to start. The mower is not anywhere near as powerful as a gas model, however, and does only a fair job of picking up leaves and debris off the lawn as you are mowing it. I have had my mower for four years, and the battery just died. Upon contacting Neuton, the only replacement battery source, I found out that batteries are not available for two months. To their credit, however, they suggested I contact a Batteries Plus; the latter were able to replace the two cells for a total of $80 plus tax, cheaper than the $116 Neuton would have charged. Now I have a full-strength battery, and the mower performs quite well, better than I remember! When buying a cordless electric, you have to assess it on its own terms, not compare it to a gas model."
3,Meh...,"It's obvious that Vol. 2 is nowhere near what his first ""Timeless"" album. Although it's a decent album, he sticks with songs that everybody knows. This album shows Michael has become very predictable. I'm not sure I'd recommend this album for someone who wasn't into his old-school, early-90's style of music."
1,Classics yes. But NOT by him!,"This recording is nothing less than a rank obscenity. Bolton has butchered (as another reviewer so aptly puts it) some of the greatest music of an era.His temerity is only equaled by his lack of talent. Shouting, crying and growling his way painfully through standards like ""My Girl"", ""Sexual Healing"" ""Tired of Being Alone"" which were done as they should have greats. Forget about carrying their tunes, Bolton could not carry their suitcases.If you remember and love these songs, this is not the album for you. While Bolton may claim that he is recording these songs in some misguided tribute to to those who came before him, this is worse than damning with even less than the faintest of praise.At first, I though his ""Whiter Shade of Pale"" was a put-on. Would that it were! This is an embarassment."
4,JLG ???,"Juan Luis Guerra a professional musician influenced by many different artist within the non commercial scene in music such as progressive music, jazz, blues and traditional non commercial latin/spanish (?) music and very well known within the latin american tropical/romantic music. Grandes exitos is a good collection but . . . not the best from this great musician/composer and singer of merengues, salsas and BACHATAS. The richness of the language put into songs in a romantic or protest statement. ""Cuando te Beso"" or ""El Costo de La Vida"" ""El Niagara in Bicicleta"" ""Burbujas de Amor"" ""Ojala Que LLueva Cafe"" ""Bachata Rosa"" etc., are some of the dozens of songs written by this great musician/composer/singer. I guess there will be more . . . what do you think? Do we want more from the great Juan Luis Guerra and 4:40??"
2,VHS to a DVD converted,"I expected more from this disk, a high quality version, but no,just some tracks have a good image and the other player straight out of my grandmotherThey should have worked harder to raise the image quality before they released an album like this."
2,Very Disappointed,"After reading a synopsis of the book, I thought I would enjoy ""Warm Hands"" because the story line sounded interesting. While there were some decent moments, overall I was very disappointed. It was unrealistic and annoying how Mya suddenly ""finds"" and falls in love with herself. Although I was curious to find out what would happen with her family, I lost interest in Mya and found myself reading just to finish the book. To top it off, there were too many grammatical errors."
5,rock of ages,the band plus horns great show wish i had been thereorginal record plus extra with bob dylanremixed for you
4,The better of the two ****1/2,"When major magazines write about the better of the live albums by the Band, they write about ""Last Waltz."" This could be for any number of reasons. Nostalgia. The guests. The film. But when fans are asked to name their favorite, the nod usually goes to ""Rock of Ages."" Trust a fan.Many of the usual suspects are here - ""The Weight,"" ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,"" ""Rag Mama Rag"" - and that certainly isn't a bad thing, but the real treat is the horn section. It gives old songs a new feel, if I can be any more cliche. And the way they start out unexpectedly after introducing the horn players with the Marvin Gaye gem ""Don't Do It"" brings you in, sets you up, then knocks you out with later favorites like ""Life is a Carnival"" and ""Stage Fright."" At the time it was excellent and revelatory. Today, it's one of the best live albums of all time.Overall: 9 out of 10."
3,This is Gonna Make Alot of People Mad...,"...but I gotta submit a gripe about this live album.The vocals are somewhat buried, and for that reason, I'd go with ""The Last Waltz"" over ""Rock of Ages."" I love The Band, I love virtually every song on this album, but whoever mixed it forgot (or didn't realize) that so much of the emotive power in The Band lay in their glorious voices. The horn section is way louder than their voices, and I don't understand that. You'd think that would be something they'd correct when putting together this reissue, but they didn't.Still, as a big Band fan, I own it, and I'm glad I do. But if I were to suggest a ""live"" Band album on audio quality alone, I'd go with ""The Last Waltz."""
5,Coveralls,Bought these coveralls for my son in law for Christmas. They were a nice deep green and not too heavy for mainly indoor work.
1,D&B is not a good place to do business. Buy at your own risk,"They promised a size change, never shipped. Cost me over 100.00 and I still have togo out and buy these things elswhere. DON'T BUY THESE FROM D&B"
4,Ok,"This movie is good, I liked how the Carlina found out that she was kidnapped, and got in touch with her real parents. Great True Story"
4,Great soy-free flavor but gives your mouth a workout!,"These chips are very addicting. I really enjoy the flavor and the fact that they are soy free (I seriously don't get why it seems like every American product out there has soy of some form in it especially when you consider all the negatives that go hand in hand with soy), I just wish they weren't so hard! Crunching through them is a chore! But man, they are oh so good :)"
2,Not so impressed,"I was not so impressed by the content of this guidebook. All information is very high-level, there is no in-depth information on anything. I would have preferred to have less of the Top-10-lists, but rather some that also give some more information on the various sights. The maps are okayish, but not outstanding. Lots of other guidebooks provide much better maps with detailed directions to the sights - not here, you cannot necessarily rely on the maps in this book.The good thing is the size of the book - good to take with you wherever you go, easily fits into your pocket. And if you're willing to do quite some additional research online and get a better map from the visitor center, then this guidebook is okay."
1,"Yeah, And Gravity's Not Real Either!","Hank Hanegraaff, ""Bible Answer Man,"" is reduced to little more than a Christian typist in this ultra-thin (in pages, scope and intelligence) collection of misinformation, out-of-context quoting and outright duplicity. Having no coherent theories of his own, Hanegraaff's book is nothing more than endless citations of Christian ""scientists'"" published, absurd evolution-bashing hypotheses. He cites renown pseudoscientist and creationist idiot Duane T. Gish (universally disputed, debunked and disregarded in the legitimate scientific community) no less than 25 times. And Hanegraaff's references to actual scientific theorists, such as Gould, et al, are constantly filtered through Gish's and other Creationist morons' truth-concealing works. Let's leave science to the scientists."
3,It's Okay,"I didn't enjoy this book as much, and mainly because it dealt with people in the theatre, and I am not fond of any of Marsh's books that deal with the Theatre. I find the characters - although probably true to life - very over-blown and exaggerated"
3,So-so,"These are okay but not superb, at least for my challenged feet. For those who need only minor relief, they're fine. I need more. The size & style assume everyone has a similar shaped foot. Not so. I need a much larger pad, though my feet are small: female, sz 5 shoe, 85 lbs."
1,Boring and pointless,"From the blurbs on the jacket, I expected this movie to be ""hillarious"" and ""surprising"". This is neither. I get the feeling that the filmmaker made an effort to include as much filler as possible to make it last long enough to pass of as a rentable DVD in a videostore. It was all fluff, completely unsurprising, boring, and pointless. Yet another attempt to make money off of lingering interest in all things Kennedy, even tangentally. I guess that failed congressional campaigns aren't really that interesting."
2,"hmmm, what's the fuss?","I was once told by a director I respect that I would be wonderful as the lead in this show. So for years I searched for a script or anything to get an idea of what it was all about. Well, the DVD came out so I snached it up. Not thrilled, and would probably turn down the roll if offered.Dull and hard to follow. sorry"
3,medical term book review,"Condition of the book was just as the seller stated, some writing and highlighting but not to much. All flash cards and C.D. were in new condition. Shipping was on time as scheduled. Would liked to have chosen a faster way of shipping. Is there a way to do this? I tryed to changed it but was unable. Overall very pleased with service. Thank you."
1,Missing book cd,Book was fine but it was missing the book cd. I wish this had been in the description so I could have purchased a different one.
4,Great Stone novel!,"Parker's latest Jesse Stone (in my opinion his best series...) novel is a must-read by RBP fans. Parker proves he can still spit out two novels a year that prove to be entertaining and exciting reads. Stone Cold definitely has its share of surprises that will make you want to keep flipping the pages! If you like a simple, not-too-intricate novel, straight-forward, yet breahtaking novel -- go to Parker - and especially Stone Cold!"
2,Disappointing.,"I was disappointed. This was by far the least of the Parker novels I have read. The humor was weak and this is usually a strong point. The characters were super-thin, not that they ever have much depth. The plot is straight forward but not very exciting. Pretty dull stuff for Parker."
2,Tedious attempt at Freud-ish memoir,"According to biographies, Rita Lydig, born Rita de Acosta, and Edith Wharton were not only contemporaries, but at one time, rivals for the affections of the same man. Tragic Mansions reads like an attempt for Mrs. Lydig to capture some of the literary glory Mrs. Wharton had achieved by the publication of this book. The trouble is, Tragic Mansions is a mess: I have no clue whether it's supposed to be a very discreet memoir or a fictionalized account of the aristocratic NY society into which both Wharton and Lydig were born. But I can say that the entire book is tedious and dull. Where Wharton's stories cut at the underbelly of NY's aristocracy, peeling back their layers and exposing the hypocrisy, Lydig makes a feeble attempt at a similar introspection by sharing stories beneath pseudonyms and altered situations, but they fall flat. I could recommend this as somewhat of a character study, for there are a few interesting stories, but it's virtually unreadable."
1,Contains Gelatin,"I did not realize when I ordered it that this product contains gelatin, making it unsuitable for my diet."
2,Diverting but derivative,"I found this to be an enthralling page-turner, and I had to restrain myself from reading ahead, but after only a couple of chapters I had a strong sense of deja vu (deja lu?). That the book draws significantly from ""Brideshead Revisited"" is noted early and often by the author herself, in a disappointingly obvious manner. But ""Other People's Rules"" also seems to worship at a less-exalted altar, Dominick Dunne's semi-trashy ""A Season in Purgatory,"" a roman a clef loosely based on the Martha Moxley murder and its Kennedy connection. As in ""Brideshead"" and ""Purgatory,"" the first-person narrator in ""Rules"" is a middle-class but comparatively impoverished young person drawn in by the privilege and eccentricities of a wealthy family; however, ""Rules"" resembles ""Purgatory"" not merely in theme but in plot points as well. While the similarities may be entirely coincidental, they diminished my enjoyment of the book."
3,restoring a VW.,I plan to use this book to help me restore my VW bug.This book has been recommended by a freind who said it helped him with his restoration.
2,nothing spectacular,"This book claims to have an interesting premise, and I quote from the back, ""This elegant and moving collection grew out of Hilda Raz's experience with her son's journey to a transgender identity."" And while she does touch on it in several poems, she leaves so much of this unmined. I didn't find any of the poems in the book to be particularly outstanding, and as a whole the collection was rather weak, though it did have some highlights. It starts with a great poem by Rilke. Tough to live up to, and she does not. You get a couple of good lines and stanzas here and there, but there are so many really good collections of poetry out there, that you can safely avoid this one."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this pump. First of all it is very big, so not very practical for taking on a camping trip. Also, the hose is not permanently attached like on other pumps I have used, and it does not stay attached very well. It comes with several different sized attachments, which is handy, but the biggest is actually not very big, so if you are pumping up an air bed with a large hole, it does not work very well."
5,One of the best voices of the Universe!!,"Dulce Pontes is truly one of the best singers in the world. I love fado and Dulce Ponte give such an emotion touch to this Portuguese music. Just listen to Povo que lavas no rio the way she sings and torches her voice with such sentiment and deep emotion that she tops the Mother of Fado Amalia Rodrigues, and that is difficult to achieve."
1,Dulce Pontes loses her way,"Although billed as fado, this album with its syrupy vocals and synthesizer heavy instrumentation has strayed far from the roots of the genre. I found it so tacky that I immediately resold it to a used record store."
5,Great book for little ones!!,Adorable book! My 5 month old loves the colorful pictures in this book when I read it to him. Great gift!
4,Great Stuff,I used this to remove hardened on glue from a shower door that I took out. Worked great....also works great for removing store labels from books. Get the larger size...much less expensive...and it is good to have around the house.
3,It's good for removing small amount of stains,"I purchased this because a pen had exploded in the dryer and the ink got all over my ski pants. I did applying, rinsing, washing, and drying three to four times but the stain is still there. I guess this product doesn't really work with the type of fabrics the ski pants are made of? So if you're buying this to use on a waterproof material, be advised. I found using the hand-sanitizer and rubbing it with a sharp object more efficient at removing stains. I haven't tried using this product on other types clothes so I'm not sure if this product is good or not."
2,Anthology of several dozen artists of varying skill & talent,"An anthology of works by several dozen photographers from the Los Angeles area. The book presents a mix of color and B&W images of male & female models, some nude and, oddly, some not. There is a wide variety of styles including fine art, erotica, glamour and photojournalism; and images vary from breathtakingly exquisite to trite and amateurish. Overall a very mixed bag."
2,Quarterly magazine on flower arranging,"This magazine has altered its layout now to remove most of its direct information for members of the NAFAS Association, however, it is still aimed at the members of the organisation."
3,Audit and Control,"I use this book as the basic text in my university course on computer auditing for CA's (CPA's to you south of the 49th) because it is the best text out of a bad lot. At times, Hall is concise and to the point. On occasion, for example in ch's 8 and 9 when he describes the audit of a receivables and a payables systems, his advice is detailed and valuable. Most of the time, though, he wanders into side issues in too much depth, ignores the concepts of risk and control, provides superficial advice and examples on CAAT's (despite the inclusion of the ACL disk, which, although stripped down, is worth the price of admission) and is just too thin on practical discussions of auditing in an EDP environment."
5,relaxing,Very relaxing to baby and parents! Love the Christian songs....it will relax lul the whole family to sleep..and think of our Heavenly Father as we relax...how perfect!
5,My son loves it...,"This cd is very soothing overall. One song that I always skip though is ""Goodnight Emily"" because it seems too jumpy for a lullaby, plus my child is a boy and his name is not Emily lol.One of the best!"
5,Iggy Pop Nude and Rude,"The essential Iggy Pop for every collection! Included is all of his big hits and spans his solo career and the songs with The Stooges. There is a reason he has a reputation as a Crazy Man, his music reflects that! Love it!"
2,"For the most part , this is TRASH","I spun this disk only a few times before I decided to sell it back. This is mostly just trashy, unexciting rock n'roll without much in the way of decent songwriting. I might've held onto it to hear ""Lust for Life,"" but that song has lost most of its swaggering power since it's become commercialized.I also might've held on to this disk if it had my favorite Iggy track ""Repo Man"" which should've been in this collection. Alas, it's not and I just can't be bothered with the rest. I guess I'll just go get the ""Repo Man"" soundtrack which is far more enjoyable than this dreck. =)"
5,"Burmese, an introduction to the spoken language","Just the right language course for any serious learner of the Burmese language. Within the first few lessons, John Okell is able to teach the learner a useful set of Burmese phrases. He approaches language training by encouraging the learner to repeat the Burmese phrases over and over. This rigorous approach may sound somewhat dull, but I find the method effective, down to earth and, yes, quite entertaining."
2,Not Good,"This book is disappointing. I don't think Broderick understands the technology or its social impact, which is a major problem considered the book is an attempt to explain the causes, and effect on our lives, of ""the spike."" He quotes a lot of people who are smarter than he is and basically regurgitates their ideas without interesting analysis. And it's a lazy author who quotes paragraphs and long passages from articles and lectures instead of writing his own description and citing the source. Also, the author seems strangely arrogant for someone who almost gets it. He explains that everyone else calls nanotechnology ""nanotechnology or nano-tech, but I call it minting."" Hunh? Maybe everyone else calls this book good or interesting, but I call it boring (which, given the subject matter, it shouldn't be) and a waste of time for anyone who has thought about this stuff for more than a nanosecond. Or a minto-second. Or what I call speck-time."
3,Fascinating subject; long-winded and repetitive prose,"I find the subject matter of this book fascinating and Broderick does a decent job diving into the basics, but he has a tendency to repeat himself. Several times he explains a subject only to come back and explain it again two chapters later. Halfway through the book I couldn't take the repetition and long-windedness anymore, so I stopped."
2,Virtually Unreadable,"The ideas explored are fascinating, but the prose used to do the exploring is wildly uneven. While there are chunks here and there that approach coherence, to a large extent the writing consists of a sort of manic hyper-caffeinated chattiness that at times verges on hysteria. Liberally peppered with irrelevant asides that careen from topic to topic without differentiating fact from wild speculation, the book is also repetitive and poorly edited. There's also an annoying habit of taking commonly used terms and arbitrarily coining new names for them (""minting"" for nanotech assembly, the titular ""spike"" for Vinge's singularity). The jacket blurb casts this as accessible pop science writing in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke's ""Profiles of the Future."" While somewhere under all that verbiage Broderick seems to have a basic command of the subject, trust me -- Clarke he ain't."
1,How about delivering all the parts?,"This is the second delivery that came without the advertised drawbar, ball mount, pin and clip, mounting hardware or installation instructions. As is - worthless. I'll send it back for a second time and probably have to pay the 10$ shipping charge again. Refund this time, no resend."
5,Great deal..,Best price I could find. It was first shipped with parts missing. I contacted Amazon. They dropped off a new complete one and took the other one. Hassle free. It's a nice hitch and I would recommend it...
3,Not the one in the picture,"I ordered this unit based on the picture in the listing, having used the exact one previously. I received a different model. Although the company rep said it was the same thing I wasn't getting the same results from the new model. The company emailed me a return shipping label and I'll be returning it. The frizz is better but not what I was hoping for."
5,Proud to own,This show was the most important show to me growing up. It took my dreams into the kitchen and florished a love for cooking for the masses. I know so much now because of this show and these recipies.
4,What is there to say? Its a dam battery,Don't know (or remember when and what I put it in) how long it will provide energy for the item I bought it for.But the seller sent item in a timely fashion
5,Great Product!,Great product. I needed a ramp to get my lawnmower in and out of the shed. This worked perfectly! And I can make the ramp as long or short as I need depending on my project. The price was even cheaper than Menards was selling it for!
2,The item was not what I expected,"I'm told I must focus my review on specific features of the product and my experience with it. I ordered the ramp kit because one of the features the advertisement mentioned was that it specifically fit one-inch boards, of which I had many; instead, it fit only 7/8 boards. Therefore, I experienced an inability to use the ramp kit as it was presented and therefore, had to rework the boards in order to be able to use the kit."
2,Not as advertised,"I purposely spent quite a bit of time searching for a kit that was 12 inches wide so I could use it with a 2"" x 12"" plank and ordered these as the description listed the width at 12.5"" but the item that came was an 8"" wide kit. Also the picture that is shown online does not have any size description on the box but the box that came clearly has 8"" ramp kit on the front cover. Not cool!"
4,Good product,These are really handy so your boards don't push back when you try to take your motorcycle/wheeler/whatever off your truck. Seem pretty sturdy and come with all the mounting hardware. You just need a drill and socket to put the bolts through your 2x8 board.
2,Echoes in the Darkness Wanna Be,"Costopoulos spends a lot of time in his literary effort designed to prove Smith not guilty of murder. He devotes little to no time on why Smith is innocent. Plus I agree with the earlier review that Costopoulos is full of himself - it does not make for an interesting reading, nor does is add to the story he is trying to tell. He is not a particularly good writer, but his story would have been strengthened if he actually stuck to the story! Frankly, I really do not care to hear about his daughters hair color, or the fabulous legal staff he has - not interesting, does not help prove his case. And this guy is supposed to be some great defense attorney? Smith is a free man due only to prosecutorial misconduct, not to his innocence or a great defense. He should have spent less time bashing Wambaugh's book, rightfully so a best seller. He only wishes his book did half as well and would have been crowing if it did!"
2,He was a demon,"I went to Upper Merion high school, the old one, where I was told the moview was made. It was a crime free great environment. My daughter went to Upper Merion, the new school, where Dr Smith ruled. She always hated to be sent to the principle's office because he would be sitting there in his underwear and smoking pot. He said bizzare things over the intercom. Things even the students thought were strange.The strangest thing is that none of the kids told on him. They were too scared so they just gave him a wide bearth. If anyone belongs to still be in prison, it is he. He was lewd, a thief (Sears), sadistic drug addict. And not with just pot. He should still be in prison. I have no doubt he committed the crime himself. He would enjoy that."
2,"Book is fine, but the Kindle formatting is a MESS","SAVE YOUR MONEY! The content of this book is fine, what you would expect from a biography written around the turn of the century (1908, to be precise) about a religious figure.But the formatting for Kindle is the biggest mess I have ever beheld. Instead of the endnotes being where they're supposed to be (at, you know, THE END OF THE BOOK!), they are in the text, completely breaking up the flow of the material. Very distracting, to the point where I just gave up trying to read it because I could never really get into it with all the endnotes after every paragraph or two."
3,in 2 years will need a new optical engine,I have a sony lcd tv and after 2 years the optical engine went. Luckily I bought the warantee because this part is $1100 including installation. According to our repair facility this part breaks alot. The life of the optical engine is about 2 years tops. Also the optical engine gets backordered alot from sony sometimes for months. I only had to wait a couple of weeks.I loved this tv until it broke and had to be without it for weeks waiting for the backordered part.I love this tv once it was returned. I am glad my warantee is good thru 2009 so that when the optical engine goes in 2 more years I will get another new one.My advise BUY A WARANTEE
5,Fine quality LCD TV,I have this big screen LCD TV since 1 year and liked it so much because of its HD quality and sharp images. The colour contrasts are awesome. I love to watch my sony bravia LCD all the time at home.
2,Not Exactly Smashing,"I was greatly disappointed with this glossy glaze/coffee table book. I could not honestly imagine anyone would be interested in re-creating the glazes used on the second-rate ceramics pictured here. Sure, the photos are nice and the layout is attractive, but the selected works are mostly sculptural, with the glazes being not really essential to the focus of the work.The book is thoughtfully organized by maturing temperatures of the glazes, and recipes are given. I was suprised to see so many commercial glazes, stains and clay bodies used. The whole thing came across as a come-on for Guild.com and its pottery supply company sponsers."
1,For the expert..,"This is not your off the shelf model kit, ive been building model kits for awhile and you have to be really an expert to build this. the frames are pretty easy but thats it from there !!"
2,Skin Deep is not very deep,"I hate having all the reviews because the only get worse, because they don't involve my kind of people. The first in the series was more human, and country, more about her struggles as a single mother. The ones to follow were more about their art and their little world."
5,Perfect Name For a Perfect Book,"This series is one of the greatest sets of books I have come across. Each Meditation is only about 6 pages long but the it contains words of wisdom that draws you closer to God and really helps you in your day-to-day life.It is certainly for the ordinary person trying to be more like Jesus. I normally start reading a book and then never keep up but this one is definately a keeper....I actually look forward to reading it.It is clear, concise and to the point. BUY IT......"
4,A good collection of Rome TV documentaries for the money,"The largest portion of this DVD set consists of four 45 minute episodes of ""The Great Empire Rome"" which was produced by A&E and presented by Joe Mantegna, all of which were on TV a few years ago. I would rate this series as slightly better than Rome Power and Glory becuase it relies pretty heavily on interviews with a number of British classical scholars who add a lot of interesting and authoritative commentary to Mantegna's dry recitation of the historical facts. It also includes an A&E Biography of Julius Caesar as well as a 90 minute piece on Caesar and Cleopatra which is pretty low budget but otherwise is well done. It's worth the money if you are already interested in the subject matter."
5,Great adaptation!,"Actually when I watched this, I only had episodes 1 and 3, but those were two good episodes :)"
1,Gratuitous Garbage,"This is a terrible waste of time and money. The plot (or whatever you call it), the acting (or lack of it) and the quality of the video are all abysmal. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
5,The music is excellent. But the product itself arrived in bad condition.,"The music of ""Stage Beauty"" is excellent. The actual CD arrived with the cover broken into 3 pieces. Probably bad postage handling. The actual CD survived, but lately I discovered some scratches which cause a slight ""tick"" sound on one or two tracks. However it is acceptable."
4,A good read,"This book has such a unique protagonist- a prison chaplain and ex-cop. He's got faults and his own demons and you can't help but like him because he's so down to earth. John Jordan preaches and counsels cons while he sleuths on the side. He's got a great analytical mind and a crush on two very different women. This is a good, fast read."
1,Very poor,Very Very poor and character and plot development. I quit after two chapters NOT an author I will read again.
1,"NOT for head, neck, or shoulders.......","Though this DVD is titled yoga for neck and shoulders, that is not what it is for at all! It goes through a few exercises, general yoga poses, demonstrated by a Hindu man and woman, spoken in bad English. If you are looking for TRUE yoga poses, this would be the DVD for you. But if you are looking for relief from headaches or yoga for tension in the shoulders or head or neck, this is not it......."
4,Very Insightful,Centers upon teens force to leave home looking for work and adventure during the great drepression. Keeps your attention through the enitre film.
3,Good as GOLD,"I am a very big fan of the Super group ABBA...Once I get my copy of the DVD ""ABBA-The Movie. I will never leave the house."
1,Bad product,After using gloves one time they ripped. They were not what I was looking for but settled. Then for them to rip after one workout session I was very upset. A waste of money
4,pretty good,We needed something to keep the cats upstairs for a few hours a night. So we put the gate at the top of the stairs and it seem to work just fine. None of the cats have jumped the gate yet. So far so good.
3,High quality gate but my cat can jump it (please make a higher one!!),"Very high quality and sturdy gate, but my cat learned to jump it. He is 2 years old. So if you think you can buy this to keep your cat out of somewhere, it's not gonna happen."
3,the six fell off,"great disspointment with swiss qualitybought the watch april 2011 in N.Y. as present for my wife.all was fine, apart from cumbersome handling of the clasp.then, almost one year after purchase, the figure 6 on the face came off and got entangled with the hands, which stopped the watch dead.lost the guarantee papers and purchase voucher. (did not think I would need it for a SWISS ARMY WATCH!)now, I try to find a victor inox watch dealer in our neighbourhood.so much for swiss quality.fhjw"
1,"Great for the money, but breaks after about 15 uses","Loved this kayak until after about a year, the so-called guaranteed no leak valves broke and strated leaking. Coleman would not help me with this issue as it was only waranteed for 1 year. Attempted to fix leaks, but no go:("
3,New TV's Don't Fit In Old Entertainment Centers,"I have a really good 40"" CRT TV. When the time comes for me to buy a new TV, all that will be available is these flat screen TV's and I will have to buy a whole new piece of furniture to put it in, since I don't want my TV up on the wall, and these new TV's are too wide to fit into standard-sized entertainment centers or armoires. I really don't like these flat screen TV's and I don't care for the designs of the furniture now being manufactured to house them. If some customers prefer cathode ray tube televisions, then why are they being almost completely phased out? It seems there is still a market for them. In addition, why should I have to incur the expensive of buying new furniture just to accomodate a new TV? Seems kind of ridiculous to me."
4,A first rate handbook for professionals,"While six years have passed since Ms. Nadeau published the ""comprehensive guide"" it's thorough, relevant coverage of the basic topics/issues in the assessment and treatment of adults with ADD compares favorably to recent works by P. Wender M.d. and T. Brown, Ph.D. Despite a growing list of titles on the bookshelf this book stands out as one of few that offers well researched and systematic reviews of basic etiologic and developmental factors. Several chapters discuss the array of differential diagnostic and treatment issues faced by men and women with ADD and/or multiple disorders. Other chapters provide thoughtful analysis and treatment guidelines for dealing with college and graduate students, while other sections offer thorough coverage of assessment issues and strategies. For those seeking a broad-based, well-researched and accessable reference for treating adults with ADD, Nadeau's ""comprehensive Guide"" remains one of the best."
1,Misleading ordering info on Amazon,"When you order a standard Quick Pitch kit, you see you are ordering enough product for a five foot shower. But with the Kirb Perfect product description posted along with the Quick Pitch, there is no size listed and if you assume the kit will be enough to do the curb for a five-foot shower, you assume wrong.It's only one three-foot section.How ""conveniently"" they don't list the length so you'll end up ordering a second set paying twice as much as you expected with a second ""shipping and handling"" charge.I found local tile shops carry this product at less than half what it cost me to buy online."
4,Good Product,"makes for a professional looking curb that, if done according to instruction, is lots better than building forms. Used it with the 40 mil liner, Pre-pitch and Quick pitch."
3,How to ignore your feelings,"For those who have tried understanding their feelings and it hasn't changed them, those who cannot understand their feelings, and those for whom their feelings are intolerable, this book offers an answer as to how to shut them off. This left me unsatisfied, but so has every other other method I've tried to deal with my life, each in their own way."
1,No more,"Frustrated by the lack of information about this product, I called Pantone. I was told that this product is EOL. What you order now is it. Pantone has discontinued this product. Bummer of the summer."
1,Stuck,These have not worked since day one. I just decided to store them in my junk draw and ask my son-in- law to see if he can open them. They are stuck together. Cheaply made and not worth the money. In fairness to the seller I did not notify him or try to return them. It was to be a stocking stuffer for my husband as he is a fly fisherman. It was the busy Christmas season and I ate my loss.
1,Buyer Beware!,This album is a bootleg and is not authorized by Iggy Pop. Neither he nor his record label get paid when you buy this disc. Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this to be sold here.
5,Great book! One of the best about apples!,Great info from A-Z about apple history in this book! Very hard to find and worth it!
5,"brilliant, interesting argument","Stephen Arata is a top-notch scholar and this is some of his best work. In _Fictions of Loss_ he makes a series of compelling, lucidly written, and imaginative arguments that are both persuasive and fun to read."
1,Bad drawings ruin a great story,There are better childrens' illustrated versions of Mody-Dick out there. It is obvious that Eisner did no research on whales on whaling. Sperm whales with visible teeth in their upper jaws? Harpoons being thrown with one hand instead of two? Whaleboats that are shaped more like bathtubs instead of the sharp-ended craft of reality? Eisner has trashed a great story with his cartoonish incompetence.
4,I Am Sore,"I'm having trouble just typing these words. Every part of my body aches. Yeah the stick figures are pretty stark in our Simpson's world. And true, the lack of wordy descriptions on the exercises make it a little difficult to understand at the beggining. But if you take a good long look and apply only a few of the exercises in the book, it will kick your (...) . There are hundreds of exercises in this little book. Obviously, the weight of the ball makes a big difference but these exercises hit every muscle in your body. I like this book a lot and really enjoy the medicine ball workouts."
1,"Works well, but only for a while!","This pump worked a treat, for the short time it worked! Didn't use it for about 6 months, and when we went to use it recently, it was completely dead. Appears the internal battery has ceased to hold its charge. Only the fine print in the instructions tell you to keep it charged or the battery dies. Not a good look, Coleman!"
4,super bueno,"super bueno, lo unico es que la manguera a veces se desprende no quedan muy bien encajadas, sin embargo lleno mi piscina en 5min.tiene muy buena potencia y el mecanismo de seguridad es adecuado, sobre todo para ninos."
1,Virtual gibberish,"Written with pompous, pretentious and convoluted style, this book is an exercise in tedium. I had to read this book in architecture school, on more than one occasion; I wanted to throw it out the window. Only read this book if you enjoy being condescended to and/or must for school.I can summarize the book in one sentence: Proportion is important in architecture."
5,This is the Best One.,"If any album is a must by for MSB fans it is this one. Cabin Fever is a THE BEST produced and BEST sounding of all MSB's records. . It also sounds delicious because the use of tasteful melodies, backing vocals and strings. Plus, this was also pre Pelaner/Stanley over compressed, over eq'ed bombastic productions. Michael's voice sounded great. He performed his role of a singer, not a yeller, like later in his career. This Album also features the playing of other great band members like Gary Markasky. His solo at the end of ""Why Should Love Be This Way"" is the best solo ever on any MSB album. WARNING: Do not buy the single with a hack job of an edit in this solo.So skip buying the well know mediocrity of later years, and buy this one instead. JGCRS."
5,Butter dispenser really works well,I just received this and it works really great. As other reviewers have written it dispenses such a nice small slice that it does help you use less butter. Since reading and article about margarine recently and how bad it is for you I had switched to using only butter but this helps me use less butter since I am not slicing off a large hunk. It is so thin that it spreads easily even when it is cold from the fridge. Really like this.
3,I'll use it but don't love it,"I bought this for myself after spending every morning shaving thin slices of butter for the kids toast. The slices are kind of thick and they will occasionally stick to the bottom of the unit. That said, it does speed things up for buttering toast in the mornings but I can't help but feel there is room for improvement in this design."
5,BUTTER CUTTER,AT FIRST DIDNT THINK I WOULD LIKE IT OR USE IT...I WAS WRONG...I LOVE THIS CUTTER !! SO QUICK & EASY TO USE !! KEEPS BUTTER FRESH & READY TO USE IN A SNAP !!
1,Shadow Killers,"Never received the right book. The book Shadow of a Doubt by William J. Coughlin, was sent to us. Very dissapointed with the service. Still don't have Shadow Killers by Matt Braun."
4,Almost Brilliant,"Such a great love story; Maggie Gyllenhaul ( is that spelt right?) is great. It was wonderfully acted. This movie is definitly not for children to be viewing. If you thought a kid under 16 can see this you are wrong, it shows alot of frontal nudity. But this does not mean it is not excellent. I recomend you to buy this and keep it away from you sibling or child. Hope you enjoy it!"
3,S&M Litened,I agree with another reviewer's observation that this film suddenly changes near the end. All that is achieved in the first four-fifths of the film is diluted in the last fifth by a too complete and convenient (for the film maker) resolution. It's as if the director and the writers after making a great effort for such a long time suddenly succumbed to laziness. The bulk of the film is worth watching but be prepared for a letdown at the end.
4,"Sexy, sweet, funny and kinky","Two emotionally wounded people find love through a dominant/submissive relationship. Maggie Gyllenhahl is great, as usual. Warning: although the domination scenes aren't that heavy, some people could find them offensive. But I'm not into BDSM myself and still liked the movie a lot."
2,Mediocre at best,"It is hard to catergorise this film. Whether it is a romantic comedy, a black comedy, a drama or a sexual thriller there really is only one word I can use to describe it...Boring.I bought this without seeing it for one reason and one reason only. Maggie Gyllenhaal... She is an amazing actress and I am a big fan of her talents and while I was expecting this movie to be left of centre, not even her performance could stop me from falling asleep in parts.Its not that I bought this without knowing anything about it, I researched it and read many reviews, the storyline did interest me but I was just always waiting for the movie to get into it. James Spader is stale, as was the rest of the supporting cast. Two stars however for Maggie Gyllenhaal, who's performance alone will no doubt attract fans of hers to this film."
5,A great way to help vanila's understand a D/s relationship,"This film doesn't just cover the S/m aspect of BDSM but also the D/s (domination/submision). It an eye opening movie for those who don't know much about BDSM other than the typical lies, myths, and stereotypes perpetuated by society.All in all James spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal made this a great movie and I recommend it to anyone who has an open mind, or someone who is willing to put themselves in another persons shoes."
1,not softcore not good enuf for TV,"DON'T BE DECEIVED BY THE COVER - NO STOCKINGS, NO HEELS. ONE BRIEF SPANKING SCENE (no flesh included) is the highlight of the film. Perhaps lifestylers would get nostalgic about this story, but for the curious weekend thrill seeker this DVD is sure to disappoint, if not get you 'shut out'. Definitely not a couples movie unless your lady is VERY much into BDSM, in which case this would only be a 101 level course if not a grade school primer. Don't judge a DVD by its cover!!"
2,"James Spader, what were you thinking???!!!","Did I like anything about this movie? Well, I liked how Maggie Gyllenhaal's character, towards the 2nd half of the movie, finally ditched those dorky clothes she wore for threads that made her look like the sexy, beautiful woman that she really was. Other than that, though, it pretty much sucked. And it was REALLY weird!! A love story???!!! YEAH, RIGHT!! It was more like an exercise in weirdness!! Why am I not surprised that James Spader is in this movie??? (And I thought his character on ABC's ""Boston Legal"" was weird!!!) For once, I'd like to see him playing somebody that's normal. After watching this movie, I'll doubt you'll EVER want to watch it again. I won't."
2,Weird Movie,"This is a strange movie about the relationship of a woman (The secretary) and her boss. They are not what you would consider normal, so their relationship is odd. The movie was slow in some parts and out of sequency in others. I believe most people will not enjoy this film."
2,"This is S&M ""lite"".","Not much of a black comedy at all. With all the fuss & press I expected more than a little spanking with clothes on & simulated body cutting. James Spader was flat & not really focused. The only thing that saves this movie was a wonderful performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal, given the fairly weak material."
5,Stunning!,"Of the three Charlotte Church albums I now own (Voice of an Angel, Charlotte Church, and Enchantment) this is by far the best one. I bought Enchantment before this one and rated it with 5 stars as well. However, if I had bought and listened to the Charlotte Church CD first, I now have to admit that Enchantment would have been a bit of a let down and I probably would have only rated it with 3 or 4 stars. This is a much more classical sounding CD and is Charlotte Church at her best. I agree with S. Alexander from Helena, Montana, who wrote a review on Feb 5, 2000 saying, ""She's done more to make opera listenable than anyone since Pavarotti!"" That says it all."
3,Incredible potential,"...but she was marketed beyond her capability at the time. I totally agree with reviewer ""yogiyoshi"" from Alaska. Ms. Church is an AMAZING vocal talent, and she clearly nailed some of the numbers easily within her range--gave me goosebumps. But I am embarrassed for her for some of the numbers still beyond her. I believe she was done a disservice by pressing her too early in areas where she was clearly not yet ready. I'm anxious to look into what she's doing these days after a few more years of maturity and, hopefully, the world-class operatic training that she so richly deserves."
4,More Opera Songs On This Album,"Charlotte Church's second album is more opera sounding then Voice Of An Angel her first album.Theres less traditional songs (like Danny Boy, Amazing Grace)and more opera songs.Her singing even seems more mature this time round.She does a good job on opera songs like La Pastorella(Rossini),O Mio Babbino Caro(Puccini),Lascia ch'io Pianga (Handel)Plaisir D'amour(Martini)and Lullaby(Brahms)There's also Barcarelle (Offenbach)and Voi Che Sapete(Mozart)which she sings in English.Other songs Guide Me O Thou Great Redeemer and Men Of Harlech (with a choir in the background )Holy City,Summertime(Gershwin),She Moved Though The Fair,The Last Rose Of Summer,Just Wave Hello(The Ford Global Anthem)and a hidden track Silent Night show Charlotte has not moved completely over to opera.Although I think Voice Of An Angel is a better album(because of the choice of songs)this album is still worth listening to because of Charlotte's singing."
4,This CD is wonderful,"I think that considering the fact that she is SO young, this cd is fantastic. Sure, some of the recordings are meant for more mature voices, but i think that she manages to pull them off rather well. I loved ""The Holy City,"" ""Summertime"" and ""Voi che sapete."" I agree with another poster though--once you start listening, you just can't stop. I can't wait until she gets a little older and re-records some of these pieces so that we can all compare the two."
1,Exploitation of a child - pure and simple!,"Charlotte Church should be STUDYING singing at her age, giving her voice time to develop and mature. She shows some talent, but it is not possible to be a child prodigy with the human voice: this is the one instrument that requires time and maturation to build a secure, solid technique. It cannot be rushed or bypassed. To do so is equivalent to putting on toe shoes before the leg muscles are ready for that. Already one can see Church's entire vocal apparatus wobbling with tension and stress. The jaw is not supposed to shake like that when the voice and technique are healthy. The people who are ""managing"" her are setting this young lady up for a brutal disillusionment."
1,Not the voice of an angel. and why no zero rating?,"I have to admit she's famous and a little good but in ""The Jewel Song"" Whoa! that is like.. My God! how could she do that! uhck! Voice of an Angel was better. I think lot's of singer famous or notfamous have ALOT more talent. oh yeah and ""Voice Of An Angel"" was just her braggin bout herself. Jessica Simpson Has a much better voice She deserves that title! Don't buy it or do. IT'S UP TO YOU!"
2,decent,"I really will make no judgement calls on the tone and quality of her voice. She is trained beyond her years, and given proper training, could perhaps become a virtuoso. But she is not one yet. Aside from the merely technical aspects, which will come if her voice is not ruined from over strain, she lacks a certain showmanship. Maria Callas was often innacurate and sometimes her voice merely gave up on her, but she truely understood the music that she brought to light. Each word was infused with passion and gave the listener, no matter what the language was, a sense of the song itself. Ms. Church's translation of music is superficial and technical. She has yet to become a performer. Perhaps in time, she will prove to be as bright a star as she is credited to be."
5,"Bravo, Bravo, Bravo!","I am not qualified to judge her operatic ability, but herinterpretations of Celtic music is magnificent. I love her renditions of Men Of Harlech, and Guide Me, O` ThouGreat Redeemer. Her appearance on the Tonight Show on April 13, 2000, singing The Last Rose Of Summer, alsoon this CD, made me realize how every month this young girl continues to improve and to show the potential to become one of the finest sopranos of our time."
2,Could Have Been Better!,"Charlotte Church has a nice pleasant voice and I have this CD and Voice Of An Angel, there are a couple of nice songs on this CD but some of the songs are kind of insipid so I can only take it in small doses and not listen to this CD a lot, actually I haven't listened to it in a very long time because it kind of bores me but it's not her singing that bores me it's some of the selections that they chose for this CD and also Voice Of An Angel that I really just don't find all that interesting and kind of has me reluctant to buy any of her other CD's but that doesn't mean I don't think she has a nice voice and I definitely think she has the potential to make a really great album if she chose some more interesting tunes!"
2,Kids and grandmas will love this album!,"One good thing about this Ms. Church's success is that children (and many adults) are being introduced to music by the great composers. It is kind of like Schoolhouse Rock meets opera. Come on all you music critics, stop taking her so seriously or at least wait until she is in her twenties and thrities to make your judgements. People love her and she is bringing in the money. You don't need talent to make money just great marketing!"
5,I'm addicted to these,"I LOVE these cinnamon pita chips. They're hard to find around me (and I live in NYC - go figure). Since I can't be trusted with a large bag, I'm glad I found that I can buy a whole box of the litle ones to help me portion-control. I have some at work, at home. . the delivery was fast, too."
5,Superman Vinyl Statue by Kotobukiya,"WOW! Let me start with art! This statue is a work of art. Fine in detail from Head to toe. Every portion of this figure is sculpted to muscular perfection, every ripple of muscle is clearly seen, even the hair looks layered. To gaze at this figure from across the room, let alone close up, insights a fascination beyond imagination, in to the realm of possibility! This sculpture is truly a work of art. If for no other reason, too own this figure would bring the joy of appreciation in all things art! From every angle this figure is well crafted. The boots, pant, and cape have a semi gloss, Hair a light shine. every muscle has a shadow effect, very well done!"
5,Great Indie Hard rock,"This CD by Aberdeen band JED was released in 2000 and although 5 years old, is a collection of killer hard rock tunes, great music, layered guitars, and some of the coolest lyrics ever."
4,good to have an extra,I needed two of these so that I could charge 2 collars at once. My first one has lasted a long time...longer than the collars do.
5,Love her.,There are no words to describe the haunting beauty of Jacqueline du Pre's work. I'm so glad I purchased these recordings.
1,This author committed a crime in writing this book,This book is one of the worst books I have ever read. It is a complete wast of time. This book was written by the writter who once worked for Forbs Mag where he was fired due to reporting stories in this fashion. Do not buy this book. You have better things to spend your money on.
2,Maybe just me?,"I picked this up because I've started watching Smallville from the first season and have really gotten drawn in by Lex. Never been a Superman fan so I went into thos blindly and I must say I was disappointed. Now maybe it's because I was expecting apple flavor and it's peach or maybe it's just lost on me due to not knowing the extensive history of these two characters. Either way I was always waiting to be blown away by this but it never came. The art is interesting and it's one of the darkest renditions of Superman that I can remember seeing. I'd say take a chance with this but know that if you are in a similar boat as I was, meaning you never followed Supes and don't know all the twists and turns that Lex had, this may be a dud."
2,Not what I expected,"This product does work, but I would not recommend it unnless you are very tech savy or have someone who can help set it up. It does not work well with Vista, but then what does,so be prepared to work at getting your notes so that you can read on your screen.I am sure there is better elsewhereCliff"
1,Toilet Paper,"this album should be entitled ""toilet paper"" so you can wipe your butt with it. he shouldve taken some mental immodium-ad tablets to keep this musical diarrhea from being spread upon the world."
4,Lowel Ego light,"The package came promptly and was well packed, especially since it includes two rather fragile light bulbs. Now, putting it together is another matter. It absolutely required two people especially since everything was rather stiff and did not easily stay in position while inserting the plastic holes into the base of the bulb receptacles, etc. The directions were OK. After everything was set up, however, it became clear that such tension was needed to keep everything together.The light is exactly what I needed to photoshoot some of my smaller items, so all in all, after all the travail of putting it together, I'm satisfied with the product."
3,Look & Feel Not As Good,"I liked the original version of Donohoe Digital's No Limit Texas Hold'em program and give that program five stars. The new program adds more featuresm including the ability to play on-line, but the look and feel of the new version leaves much to be desired. The tables felt colors don't look as good as the original version's and the new card faces are horrible. The look and feel of the original version was much better. Also, I find the number of options and settings available confusing."
5,"A great pair of durable, practical and nice looking boots","This is my first purchase from the Durango Boot company. I was looking for a pair of boots that were waterproof and could be worn as dress boots. I am very pleased with the quality and ""dress"" look of these boots. The comfort of the heel and arch is really quite amazing. The heel feels something akin to the cushion in my running shoes. These boots are even more comfortable than my usual dress shoes. My original intent was to wear these boots only on wet/snowy days, however, I find myself wearing them more and more often in the place of my dress shoes."
2,Not a womans or a mans watch,"This watch looks really cool but is not wearable. The band is small so it won't fit a man but far too heavy for a woman to wear. The design looks neat but is not comfortable at all. I returned mine, but if I were you I would not bother."
5,I'm satisfied.,"Thank you all very much for posting to me this CD. Everything went well, and got my CD in my hand in no time. I will purchase from here in the future."
4,Voodoo Drums is ON FIRE.,"Great album, Great label.Universal sounds is a sub-label of Soul Jazz. They feature great releases like Jackie Mittoo the keyboard king, compilations of reggae roots like 100% Dynamite, and classic soul reissues out the wahzoo. This album augments their cultural boundaries driving home the intense rhythmic music of Haiti."
2,Wonka SweeTarts Giant Chewy------not fresh,"the product was stale, could not chew, like they had been frozen and price was not that great, will not order again"
1,Paul is right,"most of these r&b singers (men) make me sick. I can only listen most of the time, because of the beat, the lyrics have gotten way outta hand. Other than that the talk is the same and many young and older girls do like this crap, they dis us (women & men) in our faces and say here buy this. FAMILY... THEY DEAD WRONG! We are smarter than that and should not be talked down too."
4,Blue Stars..4 Stars,"This album is surprisingly good, i'm not too big a fan of slow jam type stuff but its good to pop in when u wit ur girl and everything but when i first heard these guys i just thought they were tryin to be another B2K but as a few listens went by i finally decided to go pick this album up and i have to say that this is nowhere near what i thought it was gonna be like these guys are tight and actually have a few party jams on the cd but any thoughts i had about this cd were totally blown off when i heard it. Dont sleep on this cause you may think they're just some boy band cash pawn this album is a good listen and definitely somethin that you can listen to wit ur girl to get that mood set. Go pick this one up if you havent already."
5,"""Pretty"" Good","This CD is one of the best CD's around. This whole CD deals with sex, and if you are looking for a decent cd to get, I would recommend this cd."
5,The Spoken Truth,These young MEN are the BOMB! They going straight to the top with this bomb CD! They are so fine for all you ladies out there! The lyrics are the bomb and they gone make it if they deep on puttin out hits like these. They're focused and they are truly born to be STARS. Or as they say BLUESTARS!!!
1,"more like ""Ugly Ricky""","I think the song ""Grid with Me"" (which was #4 on charts) sounds annoying they play it too much on the radio and they rap at the same time to. Their other song ""Juicy"" talking about getting intimate with girls in the bed room the only reason why girls want them cause they are in a band and they have money they wouldn't care about them if they were nobodies walking out on the streets.It's the same o same o another R&B; group that mix's singing with rap, these days as far as guys go their R&B; music is wack. Their voices are so deep they don't hit those high tone note's like the old school R&B; groups did back in the 80's and mid 90's like:(Keith Sweat, KC & JoJo, Jodeci, New Edition, Boyz to Men, New Kids on the Block, Soul for Real, Guy, and more).Today's artist have no talent."
1,Pretty Ricky has an ugly release,"The only thing the album Bluestars has to offer is a spot for an ice cold beer on the coffee table in my living room. Ever since Macho Man, a.k.a. Randy Savage, released Be A Man, the rap game just ain't the same. The only way to succeed in the business is to tag team with the former WWF Heavyweight Champion and snap in to a slim jim. Which is what will happen to Pretty Ricky in a battle with the Macho Man. Ooooh yea!!! So Pretty Ricky, if you're listening, STEP UP! Be a man!! I dare you to take it to the streets with Randy, straight up. Then we'll see who's the man. Word."
5,OOFFFF DDAA HHOOKK!!!!!!!11,I LOVE JUICY!!!!! ITS MY FAVORITE SONG!!!11 I ALSO LIKE YOUR BODY AND GRIND ON ME!!!!!! THEY TIGHT TOO!!!!!!1 I LOVE PRETTY RICKY!!!!!!!!
3,go buy the unedited version,"You guys, go buy the unedited version. Trust me it is a lot better. I just listened to the clean version, and i think that its great that these guys are rewriting lines instead of just leaving stuff blank because it shows that they are really commited to their music, but the unedited version is much better. these boyz shouldnt have to sugarcoat their lyrics just cuz some people are more easily offended. And besides, the unedited version has better songs."
2,Did not last,"We've had this microwave for about 6 months. At first it worked well, it did what you'd expect a microwave to do. We do not do any major cooking in our microwave, generally using it to defrost or reheat food or to melt butter and occasionally pop popcorn. I was using it on 30 power for about 30 seconds and it blew - there was a loud noise and bright light inside. Thank goodness I hadn't left the room and was able to stop the microwave before a fire started."
1,Crappy,"this toy is crappy. i thought it would be cool with the grappling hook but the hook doesn't fire it just pulls with a pulley mechanism and thats not all, its also loud and slow and durable(tried to burn it didn't work:( anyway dont buy it its a waste of money;_;"
3,Reissue,"For all practical purposes, the ""hero"" is verbally and emotionally abusive.The is a reissue of Silhouette Intimate Moments No. 349 from 1990 and would have been outdated in its attitude concerning how it is acceptable for a man to treat his family at that date."
4,fun purchase,"For me, this was really a fun purchase.I've always enjoyed hearing the Hawaiianlanguage. I think it is all of thosevowel endings. :) I decided that I'dlearn a little bit for doing my chanting.I am so enjoying the exercises. I love theway the book is set up and this is part ofmy weekly fun time. For someone new to thelanguage, this is an excellentbook. The exercises in the book along withhearing them on the disk are working very wellfor me.The practice exercisesare organized in a helpful way. Andthere are little Hawaiian songs on the cdwhich I love. :)"
1,more a catalog than set of plans,"I looked at a copy of this book, but will freely admit that I did not buy it. Years ago I did purchase (by mail, sight unseen), a copy of the ""Strom Classic Toys"" that was published in 1983. I was royally offended to find that that 96 page book included 56 pages of a wordy and drawn-out kid's story that my own kids (who love books) never once sat through, and pictures of 28 individual toys and a marina complex of boats, docks, etc. There were, however, plans for only 6 of the individual toys, and only about half of the simplistic marina designs. The rest were listed as plans for sale; the whole thing felt more like a catalog than a book about building toys... This volume continues that format, with a larger proportion of plans included(20/35), but those are less than complete. Perhaps my rejection of this book was partially driven by earlier and long-lived disgust with the predecessor, but there you are."
2,Disappointed...,"Nasty Nas to Esco to Escobar, now he is Nastradamus.... On the real, I want either Nasty Nas or just plain ol' Nas back. Like most other people, I agree that ""Illmatic"" was a classic. ""It Was Written"" was hot too. Those were CD's where I could listen to every track. $""I Am"" was decent but this one, ""Nastradamus"" is the worse. I'm just not feeling it. There are only 2 or 3 hot tracks on there, the hottest being the Primo produced ""Come Get Me"". Nas is one of the illest mc's out there, no doubt, but he's too good to rhyme over garbage tracks. Let Primo, Havoc, Extra P and even the Trackmasters get back behind the boards....."
2,Please Read,"Nas if you are out there please take note. The trakmasters are only good for getting jiggy beats. Tell Az and Foxy too while your at it. GO and ask Primo, Extra-P, Pete ROck, Q-tip, and even the good doctor from the west coast to hook you up with beats. The problem with this album does not lie in production alone though. Nas, the hooks on this album and the last two, man, start thinking about hip-hop again. Straight hip-hop that you used to spit on your own stuff and still do on other people joints. Come back to us, hip-hop needs you. But please don't put any more of this stuff on our music stor shelves."
3,Both ways,"Nas is ill this album was good but it can go both ways because there were some songs that were not that good but overall it's worth it. hit songs to me are life we chose, come get me, and new world."
1,Nas Wackobar,"Ok Ive respected NAs since 94 when Illmatic dropped. One of the illest albums i heard Out of everything great production, Great lyrics all that. It was written Was a good album had some duds had some Spectacular Songs. I am i thought was one of the worst hip hop albums of all time. And now this, This is an ok album. It is way better than I am but still lacks. Lyrics are Ok, Beats are pretty pathetic. Some ppl Say Nas has aged but Most things when aged Come out better. If ya a Nas fan pick it up. I knew it wasnt great but i picked it up. But He should of stuck with the promo that was way tighter."
3,nas could do much better,the only song worth listen to is nastradamus. i was very dissappointed by nas effort. his predictions was way off!!!
3,Its the worst NAs cd but is listenable,"Nas shoulda stayed in the studio.with the exception of Come Get me, Shoot em Up, new World GOd loves us this cd is kinda weak. This can even be put in my cd changer at the same time as Illmatic or It was written. Nas needs to stop worrying about buying a new car and should worry about producing another Hip-Hop classic i Hope is next one is better produced and he takes more time to write them rhymes.He needs to Work with Premo more every song they cut together is just unbelieveable"
2,Sorry,"If you are a longtime fan or nas you wouldnt like this album, he changed his style up so much. I only like about 2 or 3 songs. Nas needs to get back to the basics."
1,More like Nastrodumbass,What was Nas thinkin when he made this cd his second in 1 year.That was a stupid thing to do . Come get me is the best song by far . After that not much. Don't get it unless ur an absolute Nas fanatic and need to have everything he puts out . My friend burned it for me thank god i didnt waste my 13 bucks on it .
4,Nas is gettin' better,Yo dis cd was tight from any point of view. Da music is really good and da songs on da album are Nas's best yet. So Nas can be proud of dis album cuz it's a really tight one. Nas works on dis album with good producers so dat da albums gets a fresh yet funky sound.
2,why did he change the tracks,"How did Nas change so much? From a debut that is faultless to this rubish. Artists usauly advance thier lyrics over the years but Nas has actually gone backwards with each release. The original version of Nastradamus was very good and easily his best album since Illmatic, but only Project Windows remains on the retail version. The brillant Among Kings,Poppa was a Playa,Drunk by Myself,Blaze a 50 and Day Dreamin have been replaced with rubish like Big Girl and You Owe me. There are a couple of good tracks like God love us,Come get me and of course Project windows. This album will survive a few listens but will soon sit in your collection and gather dust with I am and It was written. Remember when we said Nas was the new Rakim... well we all apologise to Rakim. For those of us who wish for a primo snare and a lyrical genuis to hit the mic we will have to wait and maybe Nas will be nasty on his next album."
2,'Illmatic Style' GONE FOREVER!,"Not the Nas of the past on this one. If you are a die hard Nas fan, you might appreciate a few tracks on here such as ""Life we chose"", and ""Last Words"", but after track 9, forget it. The second half of the album is the worst production I have ever heard form Nas. This is his worst album yet, so hip hop heads wont be hurt by leaving this one on the shelves."
3,"Nas, the urban poet, fell short","Anyone familiar with Nas knows that he is more than a rapper. He is a wordy, poetic mastermind who adds fresh beats to moving lyrics in a marriage that anyone could love. But Nas... what happened? Aside from ""Nastradamus"" and ""New World"" this album is lacking in its ability to move the listener. ""New World"" has an 80's sample track that may take away from the subject within the lyrics. Sadly this is not the rappers best work, but shouldnt dissuade true fans."
3,3.5 Stars,"Nastradamus is another album of Nas' released during the bling era. It is not him at his strongest, but still a MUST HAVE!!!"
5,An enjoyable older book of Robin Cook's...,"While waiting at the ice arena last night for Ian to finish his shift (it was snowing and I didn't want him driving), I finished Sphinx by Robin Cook. This is one of his older books (1979) and is the first one of his I've read that wasn't a medical thriller. I got the recommendation from Ben Poole, and it was a good one. The story involves an Egyptologist named Erica Barton who travels to Egypt to do some translation work and to satisfy a dream to go there. She quickly gets emeshed in two murders and the trafficing of antiquities, as well as some personal issues involving her boyfriend and some mysterious people who are not quite what they seem to be.The story moves quickly and keeps your attention. Considering I'm not really into archeology, I enjoyed this novel more than I though I would."
5,Not exactly a medical book but it's good,"It was nice to get one of Cook's old books, since the last 4 books he wrote are a piece of junk.So it is not exactly a thriller regarding medical subject. but it is very good."
4,Ancient Egypt Meets Modern Day Evil,"Robin Cook brings us a book of mystery and intrique set in modern day Egypt. Erica is a 28 year old Egyptologist who has always wanted to visit the land that inspired her studies. What she quickly finds upon arrival is that all of her training could not prepare her to deal with the powerful criminal element she encounters. The novel traces her efforts to hunt down murderers, black market traders, and above all, ancient artifacts. But all the while she finds herself in mortal danger not knowing who she can trust...if anyone.This is not one of Cook's better books. It is entertaining in a mindless kind of way, but the heroine is fairly weak and unbelivable. Certainly in real life she never would have suceeded in her efforts, but that is not necessarily the point of entertaining fiction. Overall, it is a fun read and a page turner, but it is not of much substance. Cook's medial thrillers are the way to go instead of this attempt at historical fiction."
3,Hey Mickey!,"Toni Basil, for most people will only be known for ""Mickey"" and no doubt will go down in history for it. I am aware that she had 2 or 3 albums so she must of have some success albeit limited to an underground fan base. But I remember her for the filmclip for ""Mickey"". This is a CD that grows on you after more than one listen. The Spanish version of ""Mikey"" is interesting and also included on this CD. In this day of music downloads, most will probably download the tracks they like from this album. For me it was a fun listen and something that will be mixed in with the rest of my albums for parties and 80's retrospectives. This CD could have only been made better with a bonus DVD of filmclips of the ""hits"" (with optional commentary) or even an interview. People might be interested to know that Toni Basil is still around working as a choreographer."
1,"Lack of communication, needs more depth in examples.","This book has a very clear, ""lack of communication"". The book is fine for the basics but the problem exercises do not involve the basics. The author explains problems from the beginning but goes straight to the end with the problem exercises. There needs to be more depth between the examples and the problems. This book is fine for some one who already knows it. But,if you don't and want to get confused and frustrated, then I recommend this book. If you are unfortunate and are forced to use this book, I would look for an outside source for reference. Beware!!! My question to the author is: Why are you keeping the middle a secret. This stuff is not as hard as the author makes it. To sum this up, the author says here is an elementary example now I want you to solve this advanced problem. Students need more examples with more depth. This book may be titled as introductory but it sure is geared for the more advanced.Thanks, but no thanks."
4,"Suspenseful, Scary - A Good Book!","I enjoy thrillers and murder mysteries and this one was top notch. Except for the heroes constantly going into dark places ALONE looking for the murderer. Anyone who has ever seen a horror movie knows better than that. Otherwise I would have given it 5, not 4 stars. A really good, fast read about a regular guy whose life takes a horrible turn one ordinary day; when an ordinary looking man shoots him, then rapes and kills his wife. Joining forces with a seen-it-all detective, they hunt for the serial murderer who is always one step ahead of them. If you enjoy a good book, check this one out."
4,Cute Peep Toe Boot,"Got these, and have to agree with the other reviewer; the decorative d-ring/strap should have been of a working design and adjustable, as the top of the bootie is a bit looser than I prefer. I think it would have been nice to have a solid heel, rather than an open heel, too. Otherwise, these are super cute, and are great with cropped jeans or pants. The height of the platform is the right ratio for the heel height, so you feel comfortable and not like you are being pitched forward. Overall, a solid 4 rating for comfort and style."
3,MY APOLOGIES HERE....,"hey im a fan of rick springfields too, i have been for awhile. i missed his music too, today i watched his movie Hard to Hold, fantastic movie. i wanted his cd Hard to Hold, im sorry, $....should not be the price of that cd. i think the cd should atleast be $....-$..... anything higher is greed, thats not fair at all. however, better luck to the person trying to sell the cd and i will just stick to my movie, better enjoyment anyway :)."
2,Boring,"I love Starbucks and I was interested in seeing how it came to be, but this book is more of a masturbatory celebration of Schultz's personal accomplishments than a book about how the business was built. I'm halfway through it and not sure I'll ever have the wherewithal to finish it. I will, however, continue to enjoy his coffee."
5,An Excellent Book!,"This book was truly amazing. It is an honest and humble inside look at the life and career of Howard Schultz, the man who made Starbucks was it is today. The reader is able to learn many things from this book. However, the few that stand out most are: Passion, Persistence and Focus.When a person has passion he/she loves what they do and will devote everything to it and make it work. Perseverance makes you keep moving and pushing after you make mistakes. Focus helps you attack each obstacle and grow from level to level.I highly recommend this book to anybody looking to start a business and make it the best that it can be. This book will serve as a constant reference guide throughout your career."
5,I thought it was absoutly wonderful.,The book makes me laugh and cry. I thought it was wonderful. It tells the life story of a man who lives in a poverty stricken neighborhood to a multi-million dollar entrepreneur. I thought it was neat how when Howard put his mind to getting the job at the Starbucks Corp. he did just that. It was and intriguing and insightful. I had to read this book as part of a college assignment and I have recommended it to many people.
4,Good but is it true,"I found the book, relevant, inspiring, interesting and easy to read. So much so that I attempted to follow his advise and make contact with H. Schults to appoint him as my mentor. After numerous attempts to contact him without a single reply I am now of the opinion that his sucess came first then came the great phiolanthropic ideas."
4,Nicely done.,This book was a great read and well worth the time. Being a small business owner it is nice to know how the really big ones got there. This book goes into details about how to keep a big business focused by always attending to the little things. It was a great inspiration I plan on using of my business in the future.
1,ANOTHER missing track !!,"This soundtrack omits the song everyone was singing during the waterfront festival of the Virgin Mary. It's listed in the film credits, though:""Rusariu di la 'Mmaculata"" by Fratelli MancusoLuckily, it can be found on their album ""Bella Maria."" And, surprise, surprise, the artists themselves are leading the song in the movie (i.e. as priests)!Sorry, Sony -- you'll be missing my $(13.98 - Amazon markup) on this one -- I only wanted it for this track..."
4,The Somewhat Talented Mr. Ripley,"The jazz on this CD is soooo cool. So is most of the other music. But Matt's redition of ""Funny Valentine"" is kinda creepy. My friend Tom and me buy each other CDs we know each will like. I just order this one for him."
5,This is a must read....,"This is a must read novel. The book is good from start to finish, especially if you are or have ever been a, Lady in Waiting. This book truly touches home. Your heart goes out to all four (4) of the ladies in this novel. It'll help you get a grip of your own self-esteem. Be it high or low. After the first 1/4 of the way thru the book is where you can't put the book down till the end. It also contains some very deep scriptures that can bring you thru anything. It would be so helpful if there really was ""this kind"" of support group to help the Ladies in Waiting of today. So many ladies have no one to talk to because everyone want to judge what others do in stead of help and support ""LiW"". Buy this book!! You won't be sorry."
5,long lost treasure,i saw this movie many years ago and it left a haunting impression on me. it was just as impressive after many years. the price was great and delivery very fast.teriffic deal.
5,It's Still On My Mind,"I must say, after almost 30 years this movie has stuck with me. As a child, I remember going with my Mother and Auntie to see this movie at a drive-in. I fell in-love with the movie and I've been anticipating it's release every since the advent of VCR's. I remember the movie to be excellent in all ways. From the music score to the acting. Those boys were terrific. I wished we got those types of psychological/suspenseful movies today (without ALL the gore). Again, I must say that this has got to be the best thriller of ALL TIMES. After all... I still remember it after 29 years."
5,At least rent it if you don't buy it - a must see,"I just asked Netflix to stock this since it's being released on DVD, but if they don't, I'll buy a copy and I am one CHEAP guy! Saw this when first released in the early 70s as a college kid and was blown away - kept going back for more viewings until it finished its run at my local cinema, after which it seemed to disappear. I managed to rent it on VHS 10-15 years ago and was MORE blown away (you pick up more subtleties each time you see it). This is on a par with the best work Hitchcock ever did - no exaggeration. When you finally figure out what has been happening all along, you get one of those electricity-down-the-spine OMG moments and then cringe in your seat for the rest of the movie because YOU KNOW and the cast hasn't figured it out yet. This is a real gem; why it's not a household name as a classic horror/suspense film of the first order has always been a mystery to me."
4,This video is worth your money and time!,This video shows a wide variety of programs and really captures the emotion of the programs. It shows Michelle Kwan's 1996 short and long world's programs. It also includes Todd Eldrige's and Rudy Galindo's national and world performance's. This is a well made video and there isn't too much talking by the narrator. By this video while it's still available!
2,Hotels do not allow dogs,"I was very disappointed when I tried to call the hotels in Downtown Chicago listed in the book as ""dog friendly"" and told that they no longer allow dogs. The only one that still allows dogs is the Resident's Inn Downtown Chicago. Based on that, I have reason to question the accuracy of the other information in the book (ie. restaurants, parks, shops etc.)"
2,Something is off,"Something is wrong with the production or the rip of the album. The tracks come out sounding flat. The volume is low, but even more than that, the tracks just sound off-something akin to playing a cassette tape with a dirty head. I downloaded another Megadeth track off a different album, and that songs sounds find. So I think it is something with this album.I have downloaded over 30 albums from Amazon MP3s, and this is the first time that I have had an issue with sound quality. This makes me suspect it was somewhere else in the production of the album before it was converted to MP3."
4,Good Megadeth starter,"This album is a good overview of Megadeth's work. I would recommend this album to anyone new to Megadeth, or who doesn't already have their other albums."
5,A must read for all parents!,"If you don't read another parenting book, please at least read this one! Dr. Rosemond points are thoroughly explained, one per chapter, with each chapter ending with Q&A's that help you understand how you can apply the principles. This is also a good read for grandparents, relatives, friends, anyone who interacts with children."
2,Misprints galore - first 16 pages are missing from my copy,"The book is generally a good book. However, we were shipped a misprint with the first 16 pages missing. Unless you want the hassle, get something else. The service from this company (starts with Ama, don't want to get censored) is not good enough to justify the risk of getting a misprint. Horrible service. Makes me want to buy an iPad! ha!"
1,Not worth your money nor your time,"Thess CD's are not contributing anything to the visualization process, instead it is boring and not engaging. It is better to play some soft music you know you like and do your own process. Do not believe a word about re-patterning energetic blueprints or whatsoever. I have no idea what they are trying to do here. If you want to spend money, spend it on Abraham."
1,Can't Flow :(,"I had accidentally found Hay House radio while surfing the Internet, and downloaded a few of Summer's shows. I had so much success with the ""Radiant"" episode, that I decided to purchase this CD. This one I cannot get into. It sounds like she is reading it. On her show its so natural, and you can feel what she is describing, when its over you feel so refreshed!Your best bet is to go directly to Hay House and download her show, then listen to just the flow dreaming parts of her show on your MP3 player."
1,At Least the Title's Correct,"More sophomoric drivel from a guy from Tennessee whose main claim to fame is that he can sound (sorta) like a guy from Arkansas. Quite a feat, huh? There's clever political commentary for thinking adults out there, but this one's strictly for the kiddies."
5,Not to bad,"I saw this band at ""The Autumn Cafe"" a local bar/cafe in Oneonta, NY back in January '00. They where pretty good so I got their CD. The CD really is quite good. I wouldn't say their soft rock but its not hard rock ether. Their kind of like a mix of the Byrds, Crosby Stills Nash & Young, And The Goo Goo Dolls mixed with some blues. Now I know that they don't sound like they would go together but they really do make it work. I really recommend this CD."
5,A very nice miter gauge for a very nice price,"Like most Incra products, this gauge is made of extruded aluminum and very sturdy all metal construction. This is a very well made precision gauge with a lot of very nice features. For the price, it can't be beat. Needs a bit of setup out of the box, but once set to your table saw, no more adjustments should be needed. Highly recommended."
5,Super accurate,Set up is involved but doable. The flip down adjustable stop is a marvel of simplicity and yields excellent accuracy. Setting up the scale for lengths is time consuming but worth the effort. An excellent tool at what I thought was a very good price compared to the competition.
3,"Baby's First Five Years"" A Baby Record Book",The cover is flawed...it bubbles and is not smooth. When the bubbles are worked out they return quickly.I do like the contents and the fact that it is a five year record.
5,Review,"This is the single greatest anime I have ever seen. The characters are well developed, the story moves at a steady pace, and the animation is superb. I love this anime and I encourage you to buy, download, and rewatch this anime many times."
5,Great reading for children and adults alike,"Freeman A. Freelander is a wonderful children's book. I am hoping this is the first in a series of many more to come. The story is well written and the illustration by Todd Gallina is SUPERB. I purchased one for myself (yes, I am a kid at heart) and a few for my nephew's and niece's. We all love the book and look forward to the second in the series."
1,Poorly Designed,"This Screen Shelter was used once, on a 4 day camping trip.The poles are hard to set up and insert. One pole actually bent and kinked when appropriate pressure was applied, (as required to insert pin into the bottom of the tent pole).Then on the Second day the Zippers began to act up and by the end of the Second Day one on the two zippers was broken and the mesh had ripped.This tent needs a far better pole design and a much more robust Heavy Duty (YKK type) Zipper.I am very disatisfied and intend to return the product for refund.Tom G"
5,Ever better than here I changed Gods,"This is the more complete version of her story origionally told in the release titled I changed Gods (refering to her changing gods from the Almighty to Hitler) and published by a small denominational press who heavily edited her story making it much more tame than this version.Here we see much more of the same story. The excitement of education by the nazi's on full scholarship, the thrill of being involved in something important, world changing even, and then the bitterness of discovering the true nature of the man and system she so beleived in.This is a story that will thrill you and provide fantastic insights into how the average Hitler Youth viewed the war and the person leading Germany.(WARNING)For those who might be sensitive the book deals directly with the wholesale rape of German women by Russian troops a situation only lightly alluded to in ""I Changed Gods"""
5,Amazing. Outstanding. Unforgettable.,I have a special attachment to this book in that my grandmother-in-law endured a very similar experience during the very same time as Ms. Hirschmann and had it described to me personally.This book tells one of those rare stories that stays with the reader for years to come. It is a story that can move even the hardest of characters...thus making its way into the heart and embedding itself. I could recite and discuss specifics from the book but I would simply say that it is a story that touches on all the emotions of life...from the worst to the best. READ IT!
5,One of my favorite books,"I typically read historical fiction but I thought I would give this a try. It has a mixture of darkness, suspense, horror and a bit of romance, not nearly enough to make it sappy but enough to tug at the heartstrings. I have never found such a successful mix in any story I have ever read. I read this book in one night, just couldn't put it down.The lead male character is one that I too would have fallen for even after knowing his secret. If Gloria is a new author, I can't wait until she puts more of her work on the market. Thanks for writing a story that I find my thoughts drifting back to quite often. Loved it!"
3,a good effort,"Theology of the Body Explained is a gallant and partially sucessful effort by Christopher West to make Pope John Paul II's talks on this subject more accessible for those Catholics who aren't theologians.It is very serious, very careful and pretty ponderous. The book really doesn't take off until you've slogged through 70+ pages.This is a mighty subject and an important one and West deserves praise for trying to get the message to to the people but except for highly motivated grad students or those who want to really wow them down at the parish hall, Theology of the Body Explained is a bit more than most folks can digest.Christopher West wrote another book, Theolgoy of the Body for Beginers that is much shorter and far more lay person friendly."
2,A middling documentary I don't really trust,"I consider myself an objective reviewer in regard to Stone Reader. I've seen it twice, once at a film festival in New York and once on DVD. I found it an average film, about 45 minutes too long. Much too much screentime was devoted to the director and his studied emptiness. As far as questions regarding whether this film has a latent gay message, I will not speculate. I will say that I liked some of the interviews with writers, but those were few and far between. As farfetched as I found the story, I suspended my disbelief. I accepted what I saw as truth.I have since watched the DVD and read the Times article about how the filmmaker sent out 3,000 e-mails requesting that people post postitive reviews on Amazon, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE ACTUALLY WATCHED THE FILM. I find this outrageous. Stone Reader may have fooled me, but many of its reviews here do not."
1,ugh,"interviews were great, but the director is a jacka**. he's so annoying, you have to fast forward through half the movie just to get to the good parts."
4,Where are the women?,"I enjoyed seeing Leslie Fiedler in the film. He was my old teacher from University of Buffalo (RIP, Leslie).I liked the conversations about writing.But where were the women commentators and authors?Reminded me of my recent experience in an MFA program - the world hasn't changed much. Literature is still a man's game, a mostly white man's game."
3,Too thin,"Fabric is quite thin but helps if the weather isn't too cold or windy, best for fall or spring for my husband."
2,Pretty Poor!,"Does not fit description...too tight, torn at ankles! Would have returned them but it wasn't worth the time or effort."
2,Runs very small. Very Disappointed,Very disappointed with the Hanes Thermal Pant 22804. Runs VERY small! Will probably try purchasing direct from Hanes for better fitting product.
3,confused,"I ordered 2 packages about a week ago. Got the order in the mail today and there were only 2 thermal pants. I could have swore when I ordered them, it said 3 in each package. Now I will have to order more. Very disappointed with either myself for reading it wrong or for the company doing a bait and switch. I will still order from Amazon, I will just print off the page I am ordering from first."
5,Nice and cozy warm,I bought (2) pairs of these Hanes thermals and they are just what I wanted. The fit was perfect. I like this gray color instead of the traditional off-white. I also bought matching tops as well. Quick ship too and at a great price.
1,Rip-a-roni!,"The seam joining the crotch to the leg came loose within five minutes of putting them on. There's now an 8 inch long tear along the seam. Worthless! It's really too bad, because the material is nice, and the fit is just right for me, and the waist and ankles are very comfortable. Oh well."
2,Wasit is too loose fitting,The elastic wasit band feels streched out and are loose fitting at the waist. I love hanes but the long johns didnt fit right.socks are perfect.
1,Disc quality very poor,"I recall enjoying this as an LP, a long time ago, and decided get the CD. Two copies later, I am sorely disappointed with the quality. Very tinny!"
4,Another Good Adventure by the Time Warp Trio,"This is the third one of Jon Scieszka, Lane Smith's creations which my daughter (8 yrs. old) and I have read. I recommend this book because it is another story which is pleasurable and captivating. Fred, Joe and Sam are fun characters to read about. Our only negative thought about the book was the epilogue. Good try with providing this info, but as my daughter said ""dad I don't get it."" I could tell she did not grasp why this was here."
5,Best Graphic Novel!,"This has to be the best graphic novel I ever read. In this graphic novel Two Face finally gets the spotlight he deserves. In this book there are actually three mysteries. The first mystery is who is ""hang man"", the secound is who is trying to make Alberto go insane, and third wich isn't a very big one is where is Carmine Falcone's body."
4,The Long Halloween continues or Robin Begins!,"I gave this book 4 stars because it is almost as good as The Long Halloween, but not quite. This book is a sequel to that book, but in a way the two books together make up one massive story. The writing and artwork is pretty much exactly as it was in Halloween--and that's a good thing. Here we get another good old fashioned detective crime story. Once again the killer is striking on national holidays. The difference this time is that it's not gangsters getting wiped out. It's cops! Not just that but they are all being hanged and hangman puzzles are being pinned to their bodies. It's a race against the calendar as Jim Gordon and Batman try to solve this one. The evidence points to Two-Face, but is he being framed?Oh, and another selling point for this book is a big one--Dick Grayson aka Robin! We get the story of the Boy Wonder's origin and the first team-up ever between the two.I highly recommend this book especially if you enjoyed The Long Halloween."
5,Wow,This was a great read definitely a must read for any fan of the batman series great sequel to the long Halloween
4,"Pretty Good, and worth a looksee (is that how you spell it?)","Although I was expecting this to be right up there with Batman: The Long Halloween. It wasn't. It was, however a pretty good story seemed cut short for some reason. I gave it 4 out of 5 because I dont think I would ever buy it hardcover."
4,A chemistry book that's fun to read!,"I checked this out from my local library a couple of years ago, as the subject matter was faintly related to a project I was researching at the time. I was much surprised at this gay jaunt through history and the down to earth manner in which it layed out the evolution of science and learning.I find, 2 years later, that a few too many of these fascinating historical antecdotes have slipped from my memory, so now I must aquire my very own copy of this fine work. Creations of Fire is one reference book that should serve me well the rest of my life."
3,I love Vera Farigma,She's a really good actress. Not featured a lot in this movie but she steals the scenes she is in. This movie was pretty entertaining.
4,"It's a low pressure, high volume pump",This pump will get large volumes of air into boston valved devices and will be a little slower on the standard pop-top valves. This unit will not get a raft quite full enough to raft though so you may need to top off the air with a hand pump.
3,Loose nozzles,"The product offers a convenient way to pump air at outdoors. The cord is just long enough to be used right next to your car. Air pumps out strongly enough.... But there is a considerable amount of air leak from the nozzle and the adapter (especially when using the small adapter) because the adapter fits loosely into the nozzle. So, once I have enough air pumped in to my inflatable, I have to complete it with a manual air pump."
4,Not my favorite...but very good!,"Yet another good Royal Diary has been published. Elisabeth: The Princess Bride, centers around Princess Elisabeth of Austria. Her sister is about to be bethrothed to the Emperor of Austria, Franz Joseph I. Little does she know, Franz decides to pick her over her sister. This book takes you on a whirlwind ride up until the marriage. You'll also learn about Elisabeth's life after marriage, the elegant castles they lived in, and the culture during that time. The only complaint I have is that it is too short!"
2,Don't know why this book gets high reviews,"I'm a good limit and decent NL player, winning at both regularly. I wanted to take my game to the next level and this book did not help. There are no tricks or even organized suggestions in this book. It is a bunch of chat basically about being tight. I also bought Internet texas hold'em by Matthew Hilger and that book taught me tons. In fact my NL play improved as much from that book as it did from TJ's. Overall this book is a huge disappointment. It is repetetive and full of chatter which is interesting but can't improve your game. Send me $50 and I will tell you not to play KJ and Q10 in a NL game."
4,ramps,"they did what i needed them for, i did not use the pins that keep it on the truck, i did not want to drill holes in the bed liner, i also shorten the 2*8*8 board down from 11 feet to 8 feet, the 11 feet was just to long and would not fit in the bed of the truck, for safety."
1,MOST TOXIC INK I EVER ENCOUNTERED IN PRINTED MATERIAL,"About one minute of exposure to the inside print ink (could be paper too, but was probably the ink) gave me a migraine within a couple of minutes, that lasted more than a 24-hour day.I am severely chemically sensitive to multiple varieties of chemicals (mostly man-made synthetics), but was never exposed to ink this toxic, not in newsprint, laser copy, or anything printed.It is printed in China, but so are a lot of innocuous books I've read. i.e. Maybe I just got a batch wreaking of shipping container fumigant or some other contaminant - who knows?Plant-based ink doesn't bother me, but even petro-based ink never gave me a migraine this severe, lasting this long."
5,Huggable Plush Stuffed Lion,This lion if very life like. It was a great Christmas gift for my son. It is one of his favorite stuffed animals.
5,Awesome Lion,"Lion is just what I expected. It is quite large, very plush and holds is shape well. My daughter loves it! It has been a lounge chair and tea party mate since Christmas morning."
5,Review on Plush Lion,Plush lionGreat stuffed lion. Looks real. Soft and lovable. Large like the picture. I gave one for a gift and kept one. I am really happy with it.
1,Present gone awful,Received as a gift for my three year olds birthday. He was so excited. Loved it! Until he broke out in crazy rashes every where and itched himself so badly it looked like her ran through a thorn bush. Not to mention the thing sheads more than a dog.... There were clumps of hair all over this house... So even after i got ride of the horrible lion ive been cleaning his hair up for several weeks now... Steam cleaner and all....just awful. My son never had an allergy to anything before. Must be a spray they put on the lions hair. His doctor said the rashes were from the lion. However I contacted melissa and doug they were very sorry and said they would send him some free gifts to make up for it. We will see.
3,original KJ,"This is a re-release of KJ's first major label release. Anyone who is familiar with KJ is likely familiar with his later music which came after this original album.This album showcases a kind of 'original KJ.' A little more edgy, and not as goofy as his later albums. I like KJ, but this album was almost trying a little TOO hard to sound like eminem...including those little interludes.It was not long after this that KJ found his audience in jr/high- highschool kids, and he has ran with that ever since, with lyrics that are very targeted at that age group.This is not my favorite KJ album, but has some good tracks and worth a listen. I'd recommend 'Collaberations' as one of his most fun albums."
3,Real Rap,"Hey yo this is real rap and this is for that Kat from the Bronx. You need to know that GOD is the best cause he made all of them rappers cause he gave them their skills. And if you need to know cusing doesnt make rap cause old school rappers didnt say bad words. You is an ignorant person by saying this nonsence staff. Yo my rap skills is hard when i hit harder than Tyson in a Boxing match. God the king of rap, stop and shut your mouth this is christian rap dont diss if you cant handle it. Peace 2 the Homies I.E. San Bernardino"
1,This Aint No Rap Cd,"How the hell is this rap? i mean he dont cuss he aitn talkin bout drugs ak's or hoes.... i mean talkin bout god while spittin ova a rap beat aint music and by the way the song bout the greatest MC being god or wudeva hes wrong itz 50 cent(G Unit) and chingy because you see unlike dis wack-a@s artist they no what thur doing....i mean come on this guy probably aint eva been to the projects before now maybe if he goes to the ghetto and sees what really goes down he can come back and be a REAL rapper... dont get me wrong i dont hate god but you cant be a true rapper/gangsta if your putting out christian rap....So basically KJ is a complete total WANKSTA(if ya'll dont no what that means itz a fake as@ rapper) and if yall wanna hear some real rap music i highly suggest copping G Unit's ""Beg For Mercy"" Memphis Bleeks ""M.A.D.E"" or Jay-z's ""The Black Album"" now thats REAL rap aiite yo im out.......Itz R O C"
5,Good....but,"This is a good soundtrack with a good collection of reggae songs, but hey, where are Coconut Pete's Songs from the movie. I want Nasty Cow and PinaColadaBurg. Then I might consider buying it."
3,Mediocre,THE END OF THE AFFAIR is not a bad film score. It has its flashes of intrigue ... and then disappears again. This is rather flustering. Plus the fact that much of it is repetitive does nothing to influence a recommendation. For diehard Michael Nyman buffs only.
3,Carrington Revisted and Watered Down,"I haven't seen the film (Andrew Sarris's best of the year) yet, but it sounds like Neil Jordan temp-tracked the film with _Carrington_ (also by Nyman), and told him to copy the temp track. While I began to appreciate the score for what it is after listening to it a number of times, its relation to the other score is remarkable. The only energetic piece is ""Vigo Passage"", the most blatant re-use of a theme from _Carrington_, while the romantic music is good, but nothing to make it stand out from the more original but similar _GATTACA_. It's not enough of a disappointment to make me stop buying Nyman albums as they come out, and I wouldn' want to return it, but it's probably bst for those who like the film or Nyman's more romantic scores. It just goes to prove that what someone is recognized for (the score was nominated for a Golden Globe that went to Ennio Morricone) isn't their best output, as Nyman's other scores for 1999 were much more striking and original."
3,"very nice, but hard to clean","I just received these as a gift and cooked pancakes on it the next day. They stuck to the pan so I had to use cooking spray. And now there is a brown film on the bottom that I cant scrub off. Other than that they are very sturdy, they look great. Just difficult to clean."
1,Disappointing,These pots were described as 18/10 stainless steel. Unfortunately the metal was so thin you could bend it with the pressure of just one finger. I returned the item.
5,Excellent cookware set,I have tried many expensive cookware sets over the years and had to return them. I bought the large fry pan at another store and it worked out great. I then went to Amazon.com and found the entire set for under $100 and free shipping. I keep the burner on medium and no sticking. The cleanup is so easy and fast. Be sure to use a little cooking oil as to be expected with this type of pan. I was looking for quality that would last and these are that quality. Thanks again Amazon.com!
5,TFal Pots n Pans,"I loved this set so much, I bought it TWICE! After buying it as a gift for my daughter, I bought one for myself! Good quality, awesome pricing! Just follow Mfg. directions and DON'T use high heat - they don't require you to do this, they distribute and hold heat evenly and you will enjoy this set a long long time to come. You can also use either white vinegar or lemon to clean any discoloration (if you did use the heat too high) and it comes out beautifully. I am very happy with this purchase! Best thing I bought on Amazon so far!"
4,Nice set for the price,"If you are looking for a reasonably priced ""starter"" set for the amateur chef look no further. The T-fal is sturdy, good looking and wears well."
5,Amazing,It was terrific. A good heart felt movie about discovering oneself in a seemingly hopeless situation. My two brothers and I plan on going on a cross country road trip this summer because of this movie. Its also very funny.
1,An shallow insult to a ancient culture!,"Sorry folks, I really could not stand this meaningless, self-indulgent film. Worst of all, it uses the ancient culture of India as a backdrop for a pointless, unrealistic story. It is realistic in one respect. It shows how wealthy, emotionally insipid people from the first world, use countries like India in a consumerist attempt at spiritual tourism. I have worked and lived in India and have seen a lot of these types come to try to buy a way out of their personal emptiness. Like a drug, it is initially intoxicating and they feel different but in time, the illusion wears off and they are off to indulge themselves in the next such escape. The people and places they go are just things to be consumed as the characters did in this movie before they supposedly transformed themselves. To be fair, the movie is beautifully shot and the actors perform their roles with professionalism. The fault is in the story and script."
1,Can You Say B-O-R-I-N-G?,"Ugh, this movie was painfully sloooow to watch! There was some mildly funny humor here and there, but over all the movie was atrocious!!Take three estranged & dysfunctional brothers that don't trust each other. Then place them together on a 1st class train compartment to travel across India in search of ""Enlightenment"". All the while each one of them goes about undermining each others trust for most of the movie. Sounds like they each have a lot of unresolved issues/baggage and an odd upbringing to boot.Somehow or another through finally meeting up with their mother, who is a nun in India, and has abandoned them all every opportunity she can find to do so and over coming their father's death, do the finally find peace in an odd sort of way or so it seems. The movie doesn't make it clear."
4,Worth viewing for the colorful visuals of India. Plot inadequate. Annoying characters.,"I found this worth viewing for the beautiful, colorful visuals of India. It appeals to the armchair traveler in me. For that, I can forgive the significant weaknesses of this movie. Also, the acting was excellent.The plot seemed inadequate, as if the screenplay and script were thrown together after running out of time to do it right, and also as if the writers were unclear as to what they wanted to say. Characters were unusual, but annoying, childish, dysfunctional."
4,Perfect blend of scenery and music,I watched this movie again the other night and I realized it has the best music cues I've ever heard in any movie ever!
5,You have to identify with it!!,"I can't believe I missed this movie somehow, since The Royal Tennenbaums has been a favorite for years (as was the TV series Arrested Development). My husband Tivoed Darjeeling Ltd last year, burned it to a dvd, and we finally just watched it. I'm a 59 year old woman who identified with Owen Wilson's oldest sibling character. I howled as I realized this movie was making fun of ME, as well as my two brothers. For those who give it one or two stars, you must have grown up in an ideal, non-dysfunctional household - lucky you. But for so many of us, this movie hit home and, while being hilarious, also brings back a lot of unwanted memories. I've ordered it from Amazon to get a ""real"" copy - can't wait to see it again, maybe with the younger brother I haven't seen in six years!"
2,NOT Impressed.,"These are made by Schlage, but they ARE NOT the same as their standard locks. These are MUCH MORE CHEAPLY MADE. When I attempted to master-key these for a customer, I discovered that Schlage plug followers are unable to remove the plug from the SEALED lock cylinder. A workable plug follower can be made, but if you don't have a buddy who's a machinist, you can forget about it.I didn't return the locks, because I'll use them eventually (maybe on a stand-alone garage or shed somewhere), but I did have to purchase another ORIGINAL Schlage set so I could master-key them easily to the existing building's key system using the Professional Schlage Keying Kit.If I was simply replacing the locks on a door where security was not a life or death issue, these economy units MIGHT do ok. As it is, I don't like these locks enough to use on my customer's homes and sleep well at night."
4,Shipping charges were ridiculous,"the overall product was satisfactory, but the shipping charges were not very impressive....."
4,Vantec USB 2.0 Adapter does the job,I needed to transfer the data from a hard disk on a dead computer. This device was the perfect tool to do the job. It was easy to set up and I had the data transferred in no time at all. As a computer technician I will be getting a lot of use out of this tool.
4,Cable Used to read SATA I Through USB 2 Port,"Purchased the cable to read external SATA I drive used to back up now dead desktop, via working USB 2 port on working laptop, all using XPpro.The cable worked well to read external SATA I drive via a USB 2 port on my laptop. The SATA Drive did require that I install the native software from the SATA drive on the laptop. Once done, could read backups on drive and transfer files to laptop as needed."
2,Killed on of my hard drives,I bought this because I have a collection of hard drives from old computers and needed different style adapters to connect them so I could move the files to a portable drive. I used it on four different hard drives but one of them seized in the middle of downloading. At first the drive connected fine and the files seemed to be transfering then after a few minutes the hard drive died. The drive was pretty old so it could be that it was ready to die but I don’t think I’ll use it again.
3,It works,"This product worked well for me, but I have to agree with the other customers. At times my PC will not recognize my hard drives, so I had to connect, and disconnect it until it picked up the drive. I do not recommend leaving the product unattended because it can get a little hot. Other than that, it did the job and I am happy with the results. All I needed to do was upload a free recovery software, and I retrieved all of my lost data from my old hardrive."
5,Easy to use,i have had no issues i have used it to recover multiple hard drives and have never had an issue. it as saved me and my friend a lot of hardships and it it is very easy to use just plug it in and wait for you computer to read the hard drive.
2,It is what it is for what it is worth,"The product works as described, but nothing more. I made the mistake of buying it to see if it would assist in retrieving data from an old hard drive, but the hard drive must have been too corrupted to retrieve any data."
5,Exactly as Advertised -- Great Value,"I was cleaning out old computer hardware and stumbled across a stack of 2.5 and 3.5 inch hard drives--some dating back to the Jurrassic.With no sure recollection of their contents, I was reluctant to recycle them. I also did not want to take apart the HDD enclosures I already have in service just to see what was on the drives.The Vantec was a simple, affordable and elegant solution. It is exactly as advertised: SATA, IDE and power. The power cable has a switch so you can plug the cable into your drive and then apply power. It was a nice feature. The cables were well constructed and will last based on appearance (and anticipated usage).If you need a product like this, it does the job with no fuss. I would recommend it highly."
1,durability issues,"This thing worked great when I first got it. Plugged an old drive to it and my laptop had no problem recognizing it. I loved the idea of having this thing around. Unfortunately, six months later when I needed to use it again, the thing won't power up. It looks like the power cord has gone bad. I'm stuck with a useless ""tool"" that I really liked. Had I pulled it from my shelf 1 month earlier, Amazon would have let me returned it. As it's outside the warranty period, I'm out of luck."
2,The best USB to SATA / 3.5 and 2.5 IDE adapter ever!,"OK. Edit time. Since I have owned this, it malfunctioned on and off (after about 4 months of lite use). It was great while it worked. This thing is GREAT!!! I have owned a few different brands of this kind of device... The biggest thing is the switch to turn power off and on to the hard drive you want to work with. A lot of other brands have timing issues because they just have a directly connected power cord which makes hard to mount some drives. This adapter also has cables that let you connect to a laptop SATA drive without having to take it out of it's carrier! Most don't! I love this thing!!!"
5,Easy,Easy to use and a simple pug and play to get items from old hard drives. This has def already paid for itself a couple of times over now
2,Terrible quality control,"Bought one of these and it didn't work. The power cable was missing one of the prongs, thus it could not power the drive properly. Sent it back for a replacement. The replacement had the same issue, so it's going back as well. I was able to hook it up to my desktop's power supply to power the device and it worked fine. This company seems to have an issue with quality control."
1,Barely works,"Really worked only once for me, never again after that. I'm not sure if it's a problem with formatting or OS."
5,Works Great,It was exactly what I needed. It had a good length of cord which was a bonus. I enjoy the fact it is adaptable to many sizes of HDDs.
4,A ROCK MASTERPIECE!,"SIMPLY PUT, this album is worth buying JUST for ""BLACK BETTY""! I don't even have it yet but, A hard rock masterpiece at hand! Few other songs have rocked your speakers like ""BLACK BETTY"" meant to be cranked to the MAXIMUM!People around the globe will agree! OHHHH BLACK BETTY bam ba lam!"
1,Nothing but Black Betty,"I love the song Black Betty. I took a chance on Ram Jam's Greatest Hits, hoping there would be some unknown gem on it. But sadly, there isn't."
3,king of the hill,the shows great but like a lot of reviewers i felt season 3 was a disappointment. The lack of extras and the 2 sided discs. But the worst thing is that all 3 seasons that we have are in broadcast order not production order. This show has some continuity so showing them out of order can be confusing.
1,A really bad movie.,"Do not bother to watch this movie.Nothing like the Disney movie.Bad acting,even Robert Newton could not save this movie!Do not waste your money."
2,Has Glaring Ommissions !,"I was hoping for much more from this book. What is mystifying are the obvious ommissions. NO mention is made of the Roman Catholic Church, with its hundreds of millions of worldwide members. Also notable by its' abscence is any mention of the Jewish religion. For a New York City native, those are two bigtime ""missing items"". The author also fails to explain the differences within certain religions. Why are there so many branches of the Lutheran Church or among the Methodists? Does Ms. Steig have any idea? ""Finding the Right Church"" reads like an eighth grade term paper. It is ok for those seeking the most minimal, general knowledge. Those seeking real details of religions will be as disappointed as I was. To steal a line from Walter Mondale, there is no ""beef"" here."
1,Dislike it very much,"This book is not accurate, multiple errors in tables, graphics and content. Just have it bc is pharmaco textbook. Waiting the semester to end to get rid of it.Don't get it, don't waste your money."
4,Slides out easily,"A good product. The non stick coating works really well. My only complaint is that I wish it was deeper, or had more donuts."
3,Donut pan,I have always wanted to try and make donuts. I bought this pan and works fine. I just need help with making them.
4,used once so far,"Pan worked great with first use - recipe from Family Circle, for which I ordered this pan, was pretty bad - even with lots of icing. I'll just bake regular cake batter in it next time for cute cupcakes."
3,Good pan but only one recipe!,"I just received the 2 pans I ordered as a Christmas gift. My plan was to either order 1 pan plus a recipe book, OR get 2 pans. Since the pans said there were ""recipes included,"" I didn't think I would need to also get a recipe book. Unfortunately, the pans only come with one recipe. I think it'll work fine - the person I bought them as a gift for can look up recipes online, but if the product description had been accurate, I would have made a different purchase decision. I'm kind of bummed about that, but the pans look nice and seem high quality - thick metal construction and they'll make donuts just the right size."
3,"Nize size, but very lightweight metal","Works well. The dimensions produce baked cake doughnuts that look and taste much like traditional doughnuts, but the pan is very lightweight/flimsy. I worry that I'm going to dent it just tapping on the pan to release the doughnuts. The packaging actually says ""Heavy Duty"", a joke! I think my family will get enough value from the pan so that it won't be a waste of money, but I don't expect the pan to be in use for an extended period. If you buy it with this in mind, I think you'll be happy with the purchase, but personally I like to buy things that can give many years of service and won't be headed to the garbage bin in a year or two."
5,YUMMY,I ORDERED THESE PANS BECAUSE OF A RECIPE I SAW FOR BAKED BANANA DONUTS . I MADE THEM AND BROUGHT THEM TO WORK . EVERYONE RAVED OVER THEM SO I WOULD RECOMEND THESE PANS TO ANYONE WHO LOVES DONUTS AND NOT THE GREESE THAT GOES WITH DEEP FRYING ....
5,Baron Is Great,"I had a chance to take one class with Baron a couple of years ago and it was a great experience, he is very engaging and personable, so I wanted to got a video or two by him. (If you ever have a chance to take a class with him, do so. He is alot of fun.)This DVD has a a routine that is one that is leads you through a set of moves that will warm you up and lossening your muscles (Sun Salutation, Warrior) and then continues on with poses that really help develop strength and your abdominals. Boat Pose is one I love and always find that it is one that really develps my strength.The routine is just shy of a half hour with some parts a bit more challenging to me than others, but his expert advice and tips help me along."
2,ok,kurt vs booker t was okeddie and 618was okjbl and cena what a match 10/10the other matches were apile of ****smackdown what are u doing with the wwe tag team champions ships u could do some think with them and usa champion ship u have eddie booker 619 hardcore ccc big show but no u give it to orlando jordan
1,ARE people blind?,"Is everyone watching a differant show here?I watch both TNA and wweTNA's Hard Justice PPv. i give 9 out of 10Everyone is saying that judgment day rules.......are you kidding me or have expectations for wwe have gone so low that people are actually calling Backlash and Judgment Day 2005 good? Thats pathetic...quit watching wwe's soap oprah BS and turn on the tube every friday afternoon for TNA the new GOOD werstling show, yes there is now an alternative..WWE sucks and is a rippoff After this show i am no longer ordering anything in which the money goes to wwe (bouycoting)TNA is great with very talented superstarsThe choice is both yours and obvious"
3,"Incomplete without Rogue Wave's ""Eyes""","I couldn't wait for an FNL soundtrack but i can't bring myself to buy this since it doesn't include Rogue Wave's ""Eyes."" That song was used twice in FNL season 1, i think in like episode 1 or 2 and then in ""I Think We Should have Sex,"" when matt tells julie he loves her. It should have been included. It's so interwined to the show. The soundtrack is incomplete without it."
2,A fairly flaccid novel for Cadigan,"Honestly, I was expecting more after having read ""Patterns"", a collection of short stories from Cadigan. There was just too much in here that made me go ""hunh?"" You've got this cop who goes into VR for the first time and is either annoyingly naieve or annoyingly insightful, but not both. Theres a maelstrom of minor storylines that never get fleshed out and only serve to distract from the main storylines. I've read it twice now, hoping that on second read it'd get better. Nope!"
2,Cyberspace for Dummies?,"...Most of ""Tea"" chronicles the investigations of two people, The World's Most Clueless Detective (tm) and The World's Most Gullible Semi-Girlfriend (tm). They're both looking for someone - the detective is investigating a murder, and the girlfriend is looking her favorite jerk. The deeply irritating thing is that neither of them have a great deal of experience with AR (that's Alternate Reality) and we have to watch not just one, but BOTH of them fumble ineptly through a painfully dull cyberspace (a big, burned out, and frequently empty city... but I will say that[i was]was completely unprepared for[the ending], for two reasons: (1) it's a twist I never would have expected, and (2) it is so much more creative and intelligent than the rest of the book...I had to re-read a few pages, and was happy to do so. The ending alone gets the book an extra star; it's too bad the preceding 95% of the story achieve anywhere near that level of inspiration."
2,Easily jams up unless pulling in a straight line.,"If you are going to pull this in a straight line, then it might work for you, but you have to be able to pull it all the way out to get it to retract. However if you (like me) want to be able to pull at an angle, say behind a book shelf so that you can pull the charger out for your tablet, or your laptop from the shelf it is sitting on then this will not work at all. It can't even pull out at all if the angle is much beyond 30-40 degrees. If your thinking of getting one of these, maybe think of just getting a 6 foot Amazon Basics Male to Female cable, and use 3M automotive tape and/or stick on bases and lock ties to mount it where you can get to it, but also maybe out of sight for a clean look.I would send this thing back, but the shipping would be more than the original cost, so I just through it in my ""junk"" drawer. Lesson Learned."
2,The control works but...,"...every time I use it I'm reminded of how much better Nintendo's own Wavebird wireless remote is compared to this cheap feeling, yet workable control. I can't complain too much because this control doesn't cost too much and wireless and it's also one of the only wireless gamecube controls still for sale. This control feels very very cheap and who knows how long it will last before it breaks. I also don't like the decision to use AAA batteries since I've always used rechargeable AA batteries and don't own rechargeable AAA batteries. I just hope that Nintendo wises up and starts making the Wavebird again. (Please Nintendo!)"
1,failed remote for game cube,"I received remote that would not function and had no info (until this email arrived ) on how to return or get replaced and the original packing was thrown out. Now I see it is over 30 days. would appreciate a replacement happy to return because the one I have , the remote moves the player in the wrong direction"
4,Gamecube wireless controller is great !,"The Microcon Gamecube Wireless Controller,is a great product.It fits comfortably in your hands,and works just like the Gamecube controller. Priced reasonable."
1,Poor quality,I bought this controller from Game Stop. The directional pad spins on its own without touching it. I have to turn it off and then turn it back on to make the screen stop spinning. If I saved the receipt I would return it. You get what you pay for. I will be purchasing an original Nintendo product.
2,Microcon Mayhem,"While the Wireless Controller works well, if you order two, they both broadcast on the same frequency, so only one will be operational. I did not see any way to switch the second controller to an alternate frequency setting."
2,Looks good in the picture...,"This knife looks fairly good in its picture, so I thought I would buy it seeing as it was so cheap. When it arrived however, I realized why it was cheap. The knife is horribly made, with very obvious seams and bad worksmanship evident all around it. It is actually not the color shown in the picture, it is a solid black, not brass colored. The sheath is very disappointing also."
3,Minor Problems,"I've had my 250 for about 3 months and I love most everything about it. BUT there are a few problems I'm having with the MP3 discs I'm making. If you burn a MP3 CD with more than 255 tracks (think audiobooks at 64kbps) and you create a playlist to make sure you hear it in order the player will stop after the 255th track. Not a major problem I'll admit but I drive cross-country a lot and I was hoping to cut down my CD luggage when travelling. The other problem is when you fill a 700MB CDR (any brand--I've tried 6 different) and use a playlist the player will not even boot up--It just goes back to the POWER ON screen and stays there unless you go to the radio. The player has worked well other than these 2 prob's ---Sounds Great/Works Great with Audio CD's and the separate Line Out jack is great for plugging into my home stereo. I've heard customer support is in the toilet but until it stops working completely, I'm cool"
2,They don't work for long,"The SP250 is frustrating because when it works it is an awesome, revolutionary product. I would happily use it as my primary listening device because of it's ability to randomly play large lists of fully IDed mp3s. But it doesn't work well.I'm on my second player. The first became unstable and the slightest (really, really, teeny tiny) jar would cause it to power down, I could get no help from RIO so I exchanged it. The new one will not recharge batteries so I use the external power source or regular batteries. I have read reviews from people who love their devices but I am positive that none of their players are still operating flawlessly. I am convinced that mp3 cds are the best way for music fanatics to store, trade and listen to their music but this machine and the company that produces it are below par."
3,This unit is not Jog-proof...,"I bought this unit because it had the 8-minute skip protection. While this goes a long way to preserve battery life (CD doesn't spin all the time), it is not much of a service if you are a runner. In fact, a regular CD-player would probably skip less. Overall I like this little machine. It seems to play nicely with my MP3 collection and the ability to read M3U playlists on the CD's is great. One more problem...the volume only goes about half of the way I would like it to. It is only a problem with big headphones. Overall, this is definitely the best CD/Mp3 player i have tried out, but I expect I will scrap in in a years time for a 20GB (that's 400 album's worth of space)Rio Riot. No moving parts yo! The Riot also automatically keeps an eye on what you like to listen to and pushes those preferences into several different playlist options. For the money, it will blow away the ipod."
5,Great Product,The best of the best CD/MP3 player I've ever had. I love this player and you will too.Excellent price for what you get:FM tunerCd playerMp3 CD PlayerSupport for CD-RWRechargeable BatteriesGreat Display and playback optionsTwo types of headphonesExcellent Carrying caseGreat value!
1,Poor Quality and Customer Service,"I purchased the SP 250 because of the audio quality,menu options and good reviews that I had read about the SP 250. I liked the audio of my Rio 600 and had hoped that the problems that I had with that unit were the exception not the rule. From the day I recieved the SP250 I had trouble with the batteries not charging completly. New rechargeable batteries did not solve the problem. When I used alkaline batteries it would only play for two hours.Repeted unanswered e-mails and long hold times to customer service with no resolution in sight prompted me to return the player and purchas one from another manufacturer. With the track record of the two Rio units I have owned I would never buy a Rio product again."
3,cheapy looking cd player,"I'd like to say this cd player isn't the best one out there. Some radio stations don't come in clear which can be really annoying. The over your head headphones isn't at all comfortable after using them for a little while. I like the idea of the remote control but I would like to be able to switch from radio tuning to playing cd's when using the remote control. I agree with them, the rio volt SP250 is kinda bulky and big in it's size. Other than that i'd say this cd player is [bad} cuz after dropping it only one time, when playing cd's it would make this noise that gets annoying after awhile. Don't buy this cd player go buy yourself a quality cd player such as the panasonic model."
1,No Tech Support,I bought one. The CD's are just not playing in the player. It's locking up. I emailed tech support almost 2 weeks ago and have gotten no response. What a waste of money.
3,"Great player, cheaply made","I had bought the first RioVolt MP3-CD Player and it worked great until I accidently dropped it a few inches from the ground, then it refused to recognize ANY cd. I thought to myself ""well, it's their first so everyone is entitled to [mess] up on their first try"". Then I say the SP250 with the FM Tuner. It looked to be better built and with more features, not to mention a pretty good price. Well, a few months it broke as well. I cant use the controls on the player itself anymore, the back part broke away. I now have to use the remote control until I find a way to fuse it back together. I'd recommend this if you only plan on using it very delicately and don't rough it up by carrying it with you or putting it in your backpack. Hold it like a very full cup of steaming, scalding hot cup of coffee where any slight tilt will cause agony (just a tad sarcastic). It's made of very [inexpensive] plastic."
2,Sonic Blue Rio - Sold off Division????,"I have purchased the SP 250. While the unit work well, I contacted Sonicblue regarding a free car kit adapter offer that is prominently displayed on the package. After numerous phone calls, while talking with a Rebate Specialist at 1-888-859-1217, I was told that Sonic Blue was in the process of selling off the Rio division, and the website was in a state of dis-array. He recommended that I go back to the retailer, to try to claim the Car Kit from them. Funny, they had no trouble selling me an additional optional remote, you know the one with the digital display.Generally, the product works fine, even has some nice features. If down the road I have problems I realize I will be out of luck.Although they offer a competitive product their support is near the worst."
4,Great MP3 player,"Very easy to use, good display and backlight. Only one negative comment-FM reception performance is a bit weak. Overall an excellent buy."
2,Another Buyer Beware,"I too have bought a couple of these players, and am taking the second back to Best Buy today. The first one quit working after about a year, and I bought a lesser model the second time and have only used it a month before it too stopped working. They were feature-rich players at first with little competition, which I think led Sonic to be a little lax in their customer service and quality. Right now I've decided to hold off another purchase until I see some long term customer reviews of the iRiver player."
3,"The Best of its Type, but...","after much comparison shopping, i chose the rio volt for the following reasons:plays wma files alsodoesn't skipcomes with rechargable batteriesis reasonably easy to navigate once you learn howgives good info on its better-than-average lcd screenhas a useful remote and a nice skin casehas acceptable soundhas good controls.i was very pleased with this player for the first 2 weeks. then it just stopped working. i tried changing batteries, running off the a.c. with no luck. so i sent it back, and i'm now back to square 1. i've since read about other quick failures.i'd gladly pay top $ for a really quality, really well made mp3 cd player. sony makes a pretty one, but it doesn't have the features that this one has. (the sony also beeps when in pause mode- aaagh!)"
5,Best MP3 Player Ever,"It doesn't get any better than this! Everything you could possibly want in one player. I had problems with other players not recogising my MP3 CD's, not for the Volt though! It plays everythig! Lots of features, great sound quality, and looks cool! What more could anyone ask for? Don't forget that it comes from the #1 company in MP3 players, so you get lots of know how and support (not that you will need it, the Volt super easy to use). Get one now!"
1,Worked great for 6 months and now it's broke,My RioVolt SP250 worked great for six months. I carry it around in my back pack when I commute. But recently it's been cutting out if it gets moved at all - the anti skip doesn't seem to working at all. It's been very frustrating.The whole unit feels a bit light and flimsy. I wouldn't recommend it.
3,"It's Ok, but I've read better.","Lightweight, easy reading, but not much meat (excuse the pun). I really did enjoy it---while I was reading it. I was caught up in wondering where it was going. But after I finished, I sort-of said ""Ho Hum."" I guess I'm a fan of more ""hard core"" vampire novels."
3,good customer service,It didn't come in time but they fully refunded it. Bravo for being willing to own an honest mistake and do what is necessary to make it right.
1,A Man Called Intrepid is mostly fiction,"Sir William Stephenson was never named ""Intrepid"" until dubbed by the author Stevenson. He never worked for Churchill, it is doubtful he ever met Churchill. The dark figure with Churchill in the bombed House of Commons is Brenden Bracken the Minister of Information. The pictures of Madeliene and others are actually from an old 1946 movie,""School for Danger"". I believe I was the first in North America to challenge the books authenticity. My article was published in the Vancouver Province on Aug.19. 1984. Quoting the historian, David Stafford's remark in 1988: The Intrepid book is a ""farrago of nonsense"""
2,Unnecessarily Verbose,"As with most Amazon.com reviews, I must be skeptical of anyone who gives this book 5 stars. I can only conclude that they are friends of the publisher or author, because this book, while addressing an extremely interesting and important topic is long-winded and (at times) very tedious to read. After the first 200 pages though (when the US declares war on Japan and hence Germany), the pace does pick-up, making it worthwhile."
5,History is more astonishing than fiction,What an incredible debt we owe to the unknown and unsung heroes of the WWII underground secret army! Astounding courage was shown by these patriots in the face of the most formidable odds to overthrow Hitler's brutal regime. Every high school student should be required to read this to understand the events of WWII and to prevent history from repeating itself. I found every paragraph fascinating. In fact I believe it is the best book I have ever read.
2,Too technical for me !!!!,I did not care for this book because there were too much facts and detail. BORING !!!!!!! I like to be entertained with a story and can not understand why it was a best seller. I read a few chapters and just couldn't get into this book .
5,Wow!,"When a friend first recommended this book I was not ready to read it.I had read so much in this area I couldn't handle picking up another bookthat supposedly pointed the way to ""reality"".I was a tired ""seeker"".Then 2 years later in a used book store I saw a copy with an inscription tosomeone with the same first name as I. I took that as sign and bought the book.From the first page the book spoke to me like no other I have read.It speaks directly to the part of you ""that knows"".Get it!Warning: Only read if you prepared to give up the notion that you are aseperate individual with a name and address with your own little story.Give up your little story and become connected to the ""really big story"" asEd Sullivan would say.For those to young to remember Ed Sullivan used to introduce this varietyshow every Sunday night by saying ""We have a really big show tonight""."
5,This is it,"This is the one you want on a desert island. Nothing else is needed - seeking ends here. I have been fortunate enough to sit with Ramesh Balsekar, Nisargatta Maharaj's enlightened follower in Mumbai. He is getting up there in years, so if you would like an up-close and personal encounter with Truth, call your travel agent now. Ramesh talks every morning in his home toanyone who shows up. Check online for details. My sage wife says ""I Am This"" would be a more appropriate title for this jewel - but really, honey, what's in a name?"
5,Only then will you BE!,"Once you read this book you will never be the same again, for you will be elevated to a higher level of existance. And somewhere on the way of your growth, if ""YOU"" happen to dissapear your true SELF will appear. For those who dedicated their time for the pursuit of truth, this book is the ultimate book to read. Do yourself a favor read this book asap that means NOW and give it to everybody you know."
5,Currently on backorder. :),"I read this book years ago and it is fabulous to say the least. It explains, indirectly, filling that empty space within with your own Truth, not someone else's.... It also explains Genuine Self Love, something most of us were not taught while growing up. I've purchased the book for my brother. Every individual will receive their own personal weight in 'Gold' after reading this book. It speaks to all. It's worth the wait. :)"
1,Bad concept for young toddlers! Be warned.,"I bought this book because my toddler's friends were starting to bite and hit and I thought I would teach mine before she started to do it as well. Instead of teaching her it's wrong to bite, hit, kick, push, etc. it taught her to do it. She never grasbed the idea of the second page that shows you what you can do instead. Ever since we read it the first time she now says, ""Hit Friends!"" ""Hit Mommy"" ""Kick Dogs"". I was reading in a childhood development book later that we shouldn't teach by saying, No or Don't do this. Instead we should teach by saying what we want them to do. When you give them the idea of we don't do something, they don't understand and they now have the idea that they can hit friends or kick dogs.I'd recommend a book that says how toddlers should act like, we are gentle with animals. We hug our friends. Etc.I had to hide this book."
3,Good for teaching this lesson,We have this and several other books like it and it was great for when my son went through the biting stage. Glad to be past that!
2,a bit negative,"I did not like this book for use with one-year-olds. It might work better with older toddlers. I felt the repetition of the word ""biting"" was a mistake. One-year-olds often don't understand that putting ""no"" before a word gives that word the opposite meaning, so reading a book that tells the children ""biting, biting, biting,"" gives the entirely wrong impression. The book does give the children ideas for what they can do instead of biting, which could be helpful for both babies and adults. Had I written the book, I would have emphasized the positive alternatives and shown proper uses for teeth."
2,"Cute stickers, but sort of teaches how to bite and hit","I love Karen Katz books and so did my baby, so when we wanted to start teaching our son about hitting and biting, this book seemed the obvious choice. While it does have the cute illustrations that we love so much, and my son is absolutely enthralled with the stickers, it did the opposite of what we were aiming for. For instance, when we read the page that says ""No hitting Mommy..."" he hits me. It's like he doesn't hear the word ""no"" in the sentence. It's actually a confusing message for a child this age. He was nearly 12 months old when he got this for Christmas last year, but he thankfully lost interest in this one around 15 months. I'm not sorry to see it go. I think there are better books out there for introducing the idea of gentle touches."
4,"Good music, bad directing..","The music put together was excellent. A good look at the band's real talent live. But the visuals are lacking some. Director Kevin Kerslake makes the whole concert look like a low budget video.With his clips thrown together, trying too make it fit with the mood of the songs, but fails miserably."
2,A few good old songs,A few good old songs. still better than having jay-z.... he just copies Notorious B.I.G. thats why he retired. NOTHING LEFT TO STEAL!!!!
4,Megadeth-Greatest Hits,I found this cd packed with classic megadeth hits.I was stoked to get this cd so quickly.I highly recommend this cd for any hard core megadeth fan.4 stars.
3,Good Size,I bought this with a few other sizes and for all the bonsai I had this was the most practical size. Of three different sized rolls this one went the fastest. Good Size Good Buy
5,Great history book,"This is a great book about the last 9 months of the war in Europe. The author gives the German soldiers their due in fighting a hopeless struggle against essentially the entire world, yet resisting to the end especially against the Russians. This was really the most titanic struggle in the history on mankind, nothing has come even close in turns of the numbers involved and killed, and the consequences of the outcome."
5,revelation,"I have never read such a wonderfull book about History.We learn a lot from high geostrategy to foot soldier everyday's life and thougts from each camp, and armies management.Just stunning."
2,Ripped off,I bought this dvd because I also purchased Unlocking Atheletic Power. The first half of the dvd was the same footage from Unlocking Atheletic Power. The last half was some ab workouts that were more pilates based than yoga. If I had paid full price for this disc I'd been really ticked off. It now currently sits with other dvds I no longer use. Get the unlocking atheletic power disc and skip this one...
2,Not for beginners,"If you have any kind of lower back problems, I'd recommend that you pass on this one. This is for people with the flexibility of an overcooked noodle and the stamina of a ten year old with Attention Deficit Disorder.(...)"
2,A remake of an old calendar!,There is not much new about this calendar if you have been buying the I Spy calendar for the last few years. Many of the pages are duplicates of calendar pages from past years. They took the easy way out with this one!
3,"Good color, lots of talk",This was just OK for us. There was a lot of talking and it lost the interest of my 18 month old. It starts out in the treehouse and then moves to the imaginary circus (that is where it gets better) but even that did not hold his attention because of the long spaces between songs. The saving grace of the DVD is that there is a menu option for 'sing along' and it just plays all the songs back to back. If you want less talking try Colorful World Live show. Our favorite by far!
2,Good Until It Broke,I bought this adapter for my Makita so I could use Velcro backed sanding discs. I used it according to the directions. It worked very well for about two weeks until the top layers separated from the backing. Made it unusable.
4,A great all around progressive scan player,"This player has all the features I am craving. progressive scan for my soon to come hdtv, a 5.1 decoder, optical out, coax out, and a really cool glow on the front panel. I am very happy i can watch my xvcd's of my kids birthday which i made on a cd-r at a high bitrate(2000 video, 160 audio). it plays nicely with no studder or pausing sound. MP3's play nicly with a great mp3 menu system that shows you directorys on the left and files on the right. this unit had digital zoom! you can also fast forward thru your mp3's."
5,Welcome to America,"Bill Bryson's book is one of the most funniest books I ever read. I read it on flights from Europe to America and in american restaurants and the poeple looked at my when I was laughing and I wiped the tears from my eyes. All these funny stories writen with some black british humor about the american way of live from a man born in Iowa, living as an adult for 20 years in Britain and returning back to NH are true in the eyes of an european. When I came first to the USA, aged 45, I was full of prejudice. When I left, I knew everything was true and it's documented in this book. This is the way for aliens to learn how to love the american citizens and the american everyday live."
2,Not too good.,"Not what I expected. No no non no no no no no, still dumb typing in words that have no meaning, dim."
1,Why bother?,"Unfortunately, Batu is niether well-written nor a positive story for women.Toth is clearly not a seasoned author. His writing style is basic and at times awkward. The story is a simple chronological, third person narrative with no attempt to use any variety of literary device.While on the surface, the storyline seems to be sensitive to women, there is a consistent undertone of misogyny. Toth seems to equate physical beauty with self-centeredness. Batu is punished for her beauty and her self-confidence. She is punished by both the negative male characters and the ""creator"". It is as if Toth is trying to tell us that in order for a woman to be fullfilled she must not only be deprived of beauty but must be nearly destoyed by suffering as well.As for the butterfly on the cover? A cliche symbol of ugliness transformed into beauty while the story is the opposite."
1,Piece of junk!,"I bought this sawzall thinking it was quality like the milwaukee sawzall before it. It's not! As one of the reviews stated, mine stopped working shortly after use. It would run but would not cut. I took it to Home Depot where I bought it 6 months prior and the manager swapped it out for a newer 15amp version. I think milwaukee has gone downhill as far as quality. Thanks to Home Depot for taking care of me. I was thinking about the Makita 15 amp version as well but didn't like the tool less blade clamp. I was going to buy it because it came with a nice sturdy metal case. Lets see how this new milwaukee version holds up."
5,One of the best in recent years,"Some variation on the Hip sound and punchy production from Bob Rock make for a big improvement over IBE. Only the lacklustre ""Pretend"" lets the album down in a big way. It's the new ""The Rules.""My only question is why Amazon are charging this much when it's half the price at the official Hip store!"
2,fragile mantle,"The lantern is easy to manipulate, well designed. The light is very bright. But one of the mantles got a big hole burnt on it during pre-lightening and it's unsafe to use broken mantle due to the description of the manual. So I guess users should always have some back-up mantles at hand when using this lantern."
2,Coleman Propane Lantern,"Well Coleman may be the ""OUTDOOR Co"" but I didn't know their lanterns were only for outdoor.There is nothing in the Amazon details or the outside packaging, but when you read the instructions (I know -I'm strange that way"")it says never to use in enclosed space such as a camper, tent or home. OUTDOOR use only.So its unsafe to use indoors for power cutsColeman & Amazon - this warning needs to be on the OUTSIDE of the box and in the on line details of the product.Very disappointing."
2,The book offered no revelations...,"The author spent a lot of time making the case that the gun industry is just ""in it for the money"" - this shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who lives in a capitalist society. And it isn't a condemnation of guns. Guns are a product and manufacturers try to sell them - just like cars, books, toothpaste, etc.The authors second ""revelation"" is that guns are dangerous! (no kidding - they are designed to be that way!)The author's agenda to eliminate guns is thinly disguised as ""increased regulation"".The book does not address the root cause of violence in America. It's not guns - gun violence is a symptom of a larger problem. Banning guns will do nothing. The government has banned illegal narcotics and look how effective that's been..."
1,Quit Whining,"Why doesn't he understand that the only award winning studies and almost every US government study shows that more gun control only means more crime. I'd keep writing, but reviewing a book that has more B.S. than most high school term papers (I'm an english teacher) isn't worth the time it takes to reveiw."
1,Terrible,"I wanted to read this book after watching the classic movie with Rex Harrison and Gene Tierney. That movie was based on a book by HA Dick. This book, however, bears little if any resemblance to the original book or the movie made from it. It's apparently based on some TV show. It's dreadful: badly plotted with two timelines, pathetic twist ending, and a courtroom drama that reads like typical pre-Law & Order Hollywood nonsense, right down to the evidence not submitted for discovery and the surprise recognition of the actual murderer in the courtroom.Go find either the movie or the original book, and don't waste your time with this tripe."
3,It's a great option,"It's a great option, funny and posible. Excellent for changes in a small time and a few mony, all the family can do it."
5,Useful book for both novice and expert PC users,"I've never been much into ""how to"" books for PCs since I have been using them for more than a decade. I always figured I could write one myself. But having read your Underground Guides I figured I'd check it out. And I'm glad I did. There are all sorts of useful tips contained in the book that either novice or export PC users will find extremely helpful. I kept reading things, nodding my head and thinking ""that's a good idea!"" The idea of your NEAT box for a home PC is brilliant, and worth the price of the book by itself. I'm making one up for mine now. Great book."
1,stinks,"i lived in Paris for 20 years, speak French fluently, and think this book is a joke. Noone who loves Paris truly would write the things this man writes. He writes like a cynic from New England. If you prefer a cynical view of the City of Lights finding the ugly and not the beauty of the city, buy this book. I prefer to see the good in everything."
5,Anticipation,I've been to France many times but haven't spent much time in Paris. We're going to spend a week there next summer and are organizing our stay around the information provided by this book. He provides insight into some places I'd have overlooked. Very enjoyable read.
4,comfortable sleeping bag,Bought this as a gift for my grand daughter. She uses it for sleepovers at home.It's good for inside or if it's not too cold outside. But she said it's verycomfortable to sleep on the floor and a good size.
4,"Reba, the Diva of Country","A good album from Reba...actually very good. Well, what album of Reba's isn't? She always comes through with great songs. Her voice is strong and quite capable of singing sad, heartfelt ballads as she is at belting out songs with attitude. ""Whoever's in New England"" was a big hit for her, and a beautiful song. Recorded in 1986, this album showcased an up and coming Reba...a promise of more and more great things to come. If you're a new-to-Reba fan, check out this and some of her other older albums. You won't be disappointed."
5,A Gem!,"If you are at all interested in idiosyncratic British Pop Punk of any period then this is a gem awaiting your pleasure. Simply one of my favourite albums and my music passions go way back to loving ""You Really Got Me"" when it first came out. Daniel Treacy should be up there with Ray Davies as a songwriting treasure and it is a shame he does not have greater recognition. Simply sublime."
4,A few drops of Boston in a parched scene,"First heard this one on the way to school my seniour year, which was April 1984. We needed something by Boston to breakwater the rising type of synthpop schlock, and this did it. Great soaring vocals and guitars. Could have done with less production and fewer snyths, but it was 1984 and you couldn't get a record on the radio without all that at the time. Nevertheless, a great rock album. Get it."
5,Orion lovers beware!,"Warning! If you are checking out this lp, ""Orion the Hunter"" because it is listed as the most popular release of the artist ""Orion,"" boy are you in for a surprise!! Although I've never heard of Orion, he appears to be an Elvis impersonator. Well, for your information, Orion the Hunter is the self-titled release of a rock & roll band by the same name. It is NOT by the artist named Orion. Orion the Hunter features Barry Goodreau, the former guitarist of the band Boston. To the fans of Orion: Move forward and Don't Look Back, because I've got More Than a Feeling that you'll be Smokin' mad for a Long Time if you purchase this lp."
1,I'd give it no stars if I could...,"FUNimation has done it once again, they've ruined the Dragonball franchise with a very [lousy] editing job on Dragonball GT. I own some of the episodes fun-subbed, and I must say I was disappointed by what I saw in this American release. Though, knowing FUNimation, the disappointment should've been expected. The voices dubbed do NOT match the characters, like in the first couple of seasons of DBZ, (Ian Corlett, Scott McNeil, etc.). Even better about this is the fact that you DO NOT START FROM EPISODE ONE! Like I've stated above, I own the series fan-subbed, and FUNimation only uses the beginning episodes in a ""flashback"" manner, editing out many of the humorous parts of those episodes. It only took me the first half of the ""first episode"" to realize that I had just wasted my money. I recommend that you stay away from this series, now that it has been ruined. Of course, you can see for yourself if you wish..."
4,fun for all,i purchased this toy for my 5 year old grandson. it was a big hit.we all spent hours playing with it. even the dog got in on it.
2,hard for little hands and concerns about safety,"My little boy needs me to compress it and when i was figuring out how it worked my hand was on it when it was popping up and got hurt (not injured, just hurt). It is awful exciting when it pops up a foot in the air and make a pretty big noise when launching off of the wood floor and landing on it again."
1,Big Disappointment,"I bought this for my grandson and I am returning it tomorrow. It's difficult even for and adult to use. The directions are not clear and when you finally get it locked down it does not jump like described. My grandson, who loves Hot Wheels and Monster Trucks, was bored and disappointed after only a few tries. Don't waste your money! (I paid $21.95 at KMart)"
2,Outdated and Needless,"This product seems like the real deal in making the use of memroy cards as easy as possible: slide memory card into adapter, slide adapter into diskette drive - you're good to go. Not so fast.First, this tiny adapter is actually a device requiring a battery, the installation of a driver and let's not forget how slow your diskette drive really is. Not that good of a deal anymore.With the price of regular USB memory card readers reaching low levels, this device is needless.Also, if you were thinking of using the adapter on Linux, you will need a driver. The one supposed driver in existence was developed 3 years ago will only install and run on a RedHat 6 distribution. I doubt you use that version and I doubt anyone needs this adapter anymore."
1,"Pats were Great, Cafardo is terrible","If you want to relive the magical 2001 season, spend your money on Pepper Johnson's ""Won for All"" or the Herald's recap of the season, or the ""Patriots United"" coffee-table book.Nick Cafardo, a Boston Globe sportswriter, has never shown much talent as a columnist, and his lack of ability is amplified in a work the length of a book. Even worse, in a book that's supposed to be about the 2001 team's march to the title, he couldn't help but continue carrying water for two of his favorites -- Terry Glenn and Drew Bledsoe, constantly making excuses for them. For example, out of nowhere and out of context, he inserts a laughable screed against anyone who dares to criticize Bledsoe. It's bizarre! It's as if he had this whole rant built up and couldn't figure out where to put it and then couldn't contain it anymore and had to stick it wherever he happened to be in the book.Save your money and go elsewhere. Or if you do feel compelled to read it, use a library."
2,Poor writing distracts an otherwise interesting book,"The book has dozens of interesting tidbits, such as the source of the Faulk pass to Brady. It has some great quotes from both Patriots and their opponents. Unfortunately, much of it is lost in a writing style worthy of a sixth grade essay. It almost seems like Nick Cafardo read conversations into a tape recorder and then just wrote them out verbatim. He also has the odd habit of disecting individual games during the Patriots' run backwards. He will discuss second half tactics first, and then go onto the first half. Disconcerting to say the least.In my opinion, this book was poorly put together and then rushed out the door so it would be out while the Patriots Superbowl win was still fresh on New Englander's minds and they would pick up the book. Well, they got me. Don't let them get you."
3,good start but.....,"this is a good start for an IB chem book but doesnt come close to being all you need...this is in stark contrast with the ""Biology for the IB Diploma"" which is magnificent..supposadely the Chemistry book by green and damji is better, though that has gotten lackluster reviews as well...buy this book, but I would keep a couple of A-Level Chemistry books on the side to help as well. Allinall, we're on our own in IB Chemistry."
1,"Clearly, this is an aquired taste","I love Martin Clunes in Doc Martin and other things.This? Talk about mean-spirited, angry, hostile, irresponsible people.Sorry, most of the ways the characters treated each other were simply not funny to me.A woman who is always insulting her boyfriend - why is she still with him?A man who visibly prefers other women to his girlfriend. Surely, he could find someone else, instead of treating her with such disdain.Each character is more annoying than the last.I suppose, if you're 16 this is cute and bold.But beyond that?"
3,Mmmmmm,"Spanish. el produto y precio todo bien, lo unico fue un poco lenta la entrega, 3 o 4 dias mas de lo normal, por todo lo demas bien!"
1,Stopped working in less han 90 days,I purchased this item along with a two others. It's already broken. Stopped working less than 30 days after purchase.
4,favorite wired headset,"This wired headset has the best sound of all I've tried. I've had three of these. They don't last as long as I would like but because they have such good sound, I am willing to buy another one when needed.When new, they fit pretty nicely but after some time they seem to lose the tightness and eventually the earbud itself will break loose from the body of the unit (still connected by the wires) so that it becomes necessary to hold it to the ear. Still, I really like this headset."
2,Not what I expected.,"I purchased this unit because it seemed to fill my needs; and that I've had very good luck with other Plantronics equipment.But there are two problems that prevent me from using this product.1. If there is a way to attach this to my ear so theearpiece is firmly attached, I can't figure it out.Maybe my ear is too large! But whatever the situation is,it keeps dropping off if there is the least little ( ! ) tugon the wire.2. There are often times where the people I'm talking to (especiallyin a teleconference) just can't hear me.Also what I didn't expect is the need for an adapter so it can pluginto my Blackberry."
4,Good headset,"I've had bad luck in the past trying to find headsets that work well enough to not give away or toss. Usually people say my voice is not clear, low in volume and/or that there is a bad hum or static. My latest gamble was with a Plantronics MX250. I received it today and promptly tested it on both ends of all my phones. I finally found a good headset. It works on a Motorola V180, LG-CG225 and even on my Uniden TRU-6495 home phone. It's comfortable to wear and has good sound quality. On the other end it sounds just as good as the phones without the headset."
3,Very decent earpiece for the price,"After trying a bluetooth earpiece that always needed charging, I bought this Plantronics wired earpiece for safety in the car. It has fairly good reception and does not cut in and out.The two things I wish it had was adjustable volume and a softer ear grip but it is the best one I have found that is under $30 ~"
1,Too quiet to be useful.,I tried this headset on my Panasonic DECT 6.0 portable phones and found that not only was it too quiet to hear the person on the other end but that I had to shout to be heard. I returned this product after attempting to test it on a few other phones with no improvement.
2,Noise cancellation isn't what I'd hoped. I went with wired to gain audio quality.,I didn't buy a wired headset because I like wires but because bluetooth is subject to too much interference. This headset had a noise cancelling mic and that is why I purchased it but the noise cancellation doesn't seem to work as well as some computer VOIP headsets I own.
2,Verizon,"This may be a good product for verizon phones but since I have a sprint, it did not work well on mine."
1,Counterfeit Piece of Garbage,"I thought it was cheap because it was discontinued. But it is a counterfeit.At any rate, it doesn't fit. The plug simply falls out! I don't know anything about cell phone headsets, so I am really glad I dind't pay more for one.Since this won't stay put in my LG Lotus, I can't tell you if the sound quality is as poor and low as other reviewers have said. But it doesn't matter because it can't be used."
2,Not the Staheekum Scuff of Old,"I used to buy these all the time & loved them ... then for a long while I could not find them, so when I found these I was very happy even though the price had gone up considerably Having had them for a while they are a big disappointment. The old Staheekum were snug fit. These have stretched out in the width as to make them unusable.... so if you are expecting what you use to get when you bought these... these are not the old quality Staheekum Scuff!"
3,Sampson gets lazy...,"The first half of this book is quite good, and Sampson does a nice job of developing the characters and allowing you to feel what they feel - the fame, the reluctance to it all, the quick embrace of it, the awkwardness of certain situations... But, the author almost seemed to have given up on the novel halfway through. The second half was a chore to get through, and most of the magic that was built in the first half was gone. Overall, a decent read with lots of unrealised potential."
1,Dangerous and stupidly designed item - 1 star is too high,"This is a really poorly designed product. The plastic frame is not wide enough to prevent a child's hands from gripping the sides while bouncing. My 8 month old son did this and smashed his hand into the door frame. Yes, we set the item high enough so that he was on his tip toes when sitting. The item was set in the middle of the door frame. I guess no one at Evenflo realizes that kids go side-to-side - not just up and down. That means you can only safely use it with a double-wide door. Needless to say, it went right back to the store and a complaint letter was sent to Evenflo."
1,Dangerous choice,"We have been using this bouncer for about 3 months now. Since the beginning of use, the material strap that is holding the seat to the top anchor has been fraying. It is now very close to snapping and my son is no longer able to use it. It also gets tangled extremely easy and is not easy to store.My son loves the bouncing, and unfortunately we are going to have to buy him a new one (a different brand) for Christmas because this one will not hold up.Go with a different brand!!!"
5,My baby loves this Jumper,Before buying a jumper we tried the jumperoo at the store...my baby hated it. It was so bulky that my baby couldn't do anything but cry. when she tried this jumper her eyes lit up and started jumping like it was second nature. She absolutely loves the toy in the front as well. She uses it when she is not jumping. I absolutely recommend this.
1,what were they thinking?!?,"I am so irritated and disappointed by this cheap, poorly thought out toy. It is cheap plastic, the tray is too small, there is no bumper, it's very noisy when they bounce. The only nice thing was the toys on the tray but if your little one gets excited he/she can easily smack their little head into, not to mention that I guarantee they will also smash their hand between the tray and the door frame unless you have a very wide door frame. Don't waste your time."
1,POOR DIONNE!,"This is one of the saddest examples of vocal deterioration I've everheard. I have LOVED Dionne since I was a kid, but anyone with earsknows that she has chain-smoked her vocal cords to death. She justsounds so awful and strained on this--listen to any of the sound clips.They're all bad, but ""I Say A Little Prayer"" may be the worst. She completely obliterates the melody to fit it into her shrinking range.And the production is so amateurish--it sounds like an old demo fromthe 1980's, full of cheesy synths. Add to that the stale ""Duets"" concept,and you have a disaster from start to finish. Anyone remotely interestedin this once-glorious voice would be better off with any of the compilations of her classic hits from the 60's, easily found on RhinoRecords. What a shame!"
1,I agree. Awful!,"Yup. Same problem here - a handful of good shots over the course of a few weeks, then...*WHAM* Sorry, no more output. Ink starts banding. Colors don't print. Black is a mess. I tried cleaning the nozzles, buying all new ink, cleaning the nozzles again, running a bunch of high-ink, high-color print jobs. No luck! This printer is a P.O.S.! I will never buy another Epson as long as I live. My HP lasted for years. This printer lasted a month. It's amazing that a product like this is even allowed to hit the shelves. Where's the Q.A. Department at Epson? Smokin' wacky tobbaci out in the parking lot. That's where. Get it together, Epson!"
1,worthless piece of junk,"i got this printer for free with my imac. it produced a handful of good photos before going completely useless on me. it seems like if you don't use it every day, the ink just dries up or jams the heads or something, so you have to run the utility and clean the heads about 20 times before the ink starts flowing again. by which time the cartridges are empty. like other reviewers, i spend about 2 hours cleaning the heads and wasting paper on test pages before i can ever actually use this printer for any meaningful outputs. and i don't mean photos, i'm just talking about plain text printing. this printer is so awful i cannot believe it ever left the factory testing lab."
1,Paradigmatic Printer Rip Off,"""Why should a zero-stars review be possible?"" Epson Stylus Printers; I rest my case.Printer rip off perfected. Paradigmatic. Just take $150 and light a match to it rather than spend it on this. Save yourself the trouble of unpacking it and the insults of its pitiful performance. Or I guess you could buy it and drive it straight to the landfill if you can't stand to actually burn $150 in US Currency, which I think may be a crime anyway. So I guess the best advice is to simply not buy it."
4,I am a believer!,"Epson's 6-color ink holds great promise for the skiled photographer. If you have calibrated your printer with the paper stock and ink you'll be using, you can achieve stunning results.The only drawback seems to be the longevity of the prints. To get archival quality prints, you should move up to Epson 2200."
1,Worst Printer Ever,"This is the worst printer I've ever used. If you are using it for photos only, it might be okay (albeit, still not great). However, if you need to use if for printing on paper, be prepared for some major frustration. Paper gets jammed repeatedly (even heavier weight paper) and the quality is poor when it does decide to work. I've already sent back one and am currently using the new replacement printer. Same old jam problems...same poor quality. I've wasted at least 2 1/2 hours on the phone with their customer service people(who were very nice I have to admit) and have wasted additional time packaging up and returning their products. Just such a dissapointment....I detest this product and hope to save you some frustration. I feel like hurling mine out the window. Don't bother with it!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRINTER!!,"Hi - this printer is a piece of doo-doo. This is my first Epson printer, and will probably be my last. At *least* once a week the heads become clogged, and I have to use a ton on my GENUINE Epson ink to clean them. Yup...I'm using the stuff recommended by the people who built this clunker. Yes, when you get to print, photos are beautiful, but you're going to be buying so much ink it's not worth it in the least. Stay far away from this no-good machine."
1,A ROBBERY!!!!,"The worst printer I have had. I was able to print two pics without problem and never again. The head dries and you have to use the nozzle cleaner which basically consumes your ink. Epson engineered this product to make you spend your money in ink!!! I have never been able to get good quality print outs anymore. I clean the heads 3 times before it prints out so it comes out well but then, of course, i don't have any ink left.WORST THING IS that today I have ran out of color ink (trying to clean the head) and all I need to do is to print a school paper (in black and white) BUT IT DOESN'T LET ME because it requires me to spend the $40 in the color cartridge in order to print black. I AM EXTREMELY dissatisfied with the printer.WILL NEVER BUY EPSON AGAIN. And by the way, most of the positive feedback left before me look like full-blown lies put by sellers! or someone using the printer during the first day after purchase."
5,Laugh-a-palooza!!!!,I am a huge fan of John's and found this to be so funny....I love how some commediens can begin a story and continue through the material on various topics then finish with a funny referral to material presented earlier in his presentation....his material is not vulgar or obscene and can be viewed by various age groups with no uncomfortable moments.
4,RED? Huh?,"I like the cartridge...it replaced a 35 yr. old Audio-Technica that I've had FOREVER....the sound is crisp, clean, and does my old Luxman PD264 turntable proud! But I have no idea why the company would use the names of COLORS to label/differentiate their cartridges, then not follow through when they BUILD them....mine isn't RED, it's colored BLACK! Huh? Did I get ripped off? Is it SUPPOSED to be RED? Did they put a BLACK cartridge in the box for a RED one? I dunno... why make it any more confusing than it has to be? Only fours stars--because it's NOT ""RED!"""
4,It's nice tamil movie,"Paramaguru (Ajit) lives with his sister (Anu Hassan) in Thenkasi of Tirunelveli district. He succeeds in getting selected for IPS and moves to Chennai to live with his father (Raghuvaran) at Anjeneya colony. Guru is intoleratent to injustice. Guru's father knowing this nature of his son, makes him promise to never lose his cool under any circumstances."
1,not for my region,won't play on my blueray or regular dvd. says not in right region. plays on my computer only. also the movie doesn't start out like the vhs copy I originally had. why are these dvds only playable in a certain region and I am not going to all the trouble to return this. I just wont buy from this seller ever again
5,A superbly presented baby name idea book,"Spanish Baby Names is a marvelous, 107 page, A to Z listing of both boy and girl baby names, including both full names and diminutive versions thereof. Each name has a brief description of its origin and meaning in this excellent reference. Enhanced with a one-page bibliography, including a section of online saints' lives and saints' days websites, Spanish Baby Names is a superbly presented baby name idea book for Hispanic families."
2,A bad tourist guide of a little new york,The author tries to show some knowledge of the delis in New York focusing in only certain aspects that for the majority of the people are not important.The book gives less information than any serious (Zagat) tourist guide of the Big Apple.
5,Great History and Good Recipes,"I love the concept, the photos, the history, and the authentic recipes. People who love delis should make this part of their collection for sure."
1,Very Poor Quality from Wellspring,I will not comment on the film as others here have covered it sufficiently. I am concerned with the DVD transfer issued by WaterBearer Video. I purchased both Passolini box sets and was very disappointed with the quality of the video. The transfer of Porcile was the worst.The source print was so covered with dirt that it often appears to be raining in this beautiful film. The DVD contains artifacts from the end of each film reel. I have never seen anything like this in a DVD release.But the worst oversight is the fact that two of the film reels are out of order! This film is confusing enough without this problem. Don't waste your money on this.
3,Disappointed,"I wanted to love this book. I really, really did. I mean, c'mon - the cover is just so darn CUTE. But I must say, I was rather disappointed. First, it's somewhat misleading to say ""35 recipes"". There are only a few actual recipes for cupcakes. I can't remember how many off the top of my head, but I'm thinking less than 10. Then there are a few frosting recipes. And the rest of the book is basically, ""Use X cupcake recipe paired with Y frosting recipe and then decorate according to my instructions."" To be accurate, it should be more like, ""35 creative decorating ideas to turn an ordinary cupcake into a work of art"". Yes, it's cute (though I don't know if I could ever make it through a whole batch of cupcakes decorating to the degree that she does), but it's not really much of a recipe book. I agree with the others who have said you can just get your favorite cupcake recipe and look at the pictures on the cover and do your own designs without spending the extra money for the book itself."
1,Just don't buy it...,Disatisfaction guarantee!Extremely poor DVD quality almost kills this superb film.VHS would be much better...
1,scrap steel,I bought this fine example of craftmanship and decided to try to pull nails with it.well front to back it had plenty of torque but when the head pulled off a nail and I tried side to side the handle snapped right off.It sure looked pretty though.Too bad the old wal mart 2dollar hammer is better.that was 28 dollars down the tubes.
2,Is anyone else a little disturbed.... (warning potential spoiler),"I'm on page 150... and yes I'm more curious about Rory and Georgie. When do they meet dang it!!!Further more by page 150 Lizzie has decided to adopt Anna's and Ty's baby. And when Ned calls Lizzie MaMa her reply is ""My darling boy you're clever just like your father"" Lizzie has really had very little interaction with Ty at this point. Except for the kind of interaction that you would expect from a psychotic stalker. I'm going to keep reading but quite frankly I'm a little disturbed by Lizzie's obsession. Obsession =/= romance."
1,Terrible and Cheap!,Do not buy this lens kit!!!. I almost destroyed my lens filter when I applied the cleaning solution. A milky film appeared all over the filter and almost didnt go away. I don't know if it was supposed to do that but it only made my lens filter a little foggier by leaving a trace of the milky film.
2,Missed the mark...,"I found this book too advanced for a beginner (like me) and not advanced enough for someone who is at an intermediate or advanced level (my son). For example, the author talks about the parts of the gun, but then neglects to have a diagram of what those parts are. At the same time, his advice is very, very basic, so someone who already knew what they were doing may not get much out of this book. There is always a tip or two that anyone can pick up from reading a book, but I think there are books better suited for either the beginner or a more advanced trap shooter. This one isn't really right for either, in my opinion."
2,Bumpy Ride,"I'm learning database administration for the first time, so I've been sequentially working through this book. I've made it past 200 pages running all of the commands and scripts; however, I've had to do a lot of outside research in the product documentation and internet forums to get the stuff to work. I've marked up the margins of this book like crazy. Key pieces of the examples are omitted, and some information is just plain wrong (e.g. names of AWR SQL scripts). Being forced to do outside research can help you learn the material better I guess, but the time could probably be better spent if all you want is your certification. One of their commands to move EM from SYSAUX to another tablespace totally corrupted my database console service and forced me to install a new database instance. Buy this book if you're into pain and self-torment."
2,Flimsy,"I expected something better for this price. Frankly, I think a person would be better off buying a 24 inch drafting triangle. This thing is only about an eighth of inch thick and very flimsy--surely they could have used 1/4 inch for this price?? It may be accurate if you lay it down but it has zero strength if one of it's legs is pushed in any manner."
4,great mini stroller,This stroller seems pretty durable although it's a little annoying to fold and unfold by banging on the folding mechanism. It is very light and the fact that it folds is a big advantage. Overall my daughter was very happy with it and that's the most important thing.
3,NO CREEDENCE TO THIS CONCERT!,"I read the other reviews, but had to hear it for myself. John is the same ultimate professional - excellent singer/songwriter/guitarist. And I'm sure he liked hiring John Molo to accomapny him on drums. Now John is a very good drummer. But the extra fills, rolls, crashes kill the Creedence numbers. It sounds like a Las Vegas cover band with John playing this way. Doug Clifford was the right drummer for Creedence; he didn't overplay. This release is just okay. On the shelf next to the originals, I'll reach for Creedence every time, so what's the point in having/keepingthis concert cd? I guess it's kind of similar with the Beatles. The original recordings were so good, no matter how well Paul Mc. played Beatle tunes in concert, they never sounded as good as with the boys.Plus the amount of time on the discs kind of cheats the public also.My copy of this will go up for sale soon."
4,I have to say it's getting there!,"Well ,maybe I did kind go overboard with crititsizism on my last review but that is just concern and if I hurt anyone I'm sorry! But the truthis that Christina is just the kind of person who you wish would die slowly so yoou have that pleasure of wathching her suffer. The book was good, One note though I thought that in 31 Christina was 13 in this book she's 12 maybe I was wrong. Thank heavans they didn't talk about cindy the wonder person(cough cough! roll eyes !gag) This book was good but I hope Samantha comes back soon."
3,an O.K. book,"I thought this book was okay. I think that the gap is very stupid. The author should not leave you hanging with Cindy and those stories. I think the stories with Christina and that group of people are kind of boring. I think Joanna Campbell should go back to writing about Cindy, Samantha, Max, Tor, and that group. I also like reading about the racing better than the jumping."
2,Too little for the price,Foudn the text minimally helpful. Not full of insight but just common sense.Cost is too high for the return.
4,Women and Work,"The book focuses on the problems that face women everyday in the workplace. Whether one is actually referring to the labor force as the workplace, or the home as the workplace is a huge part of this book. Our society accepts that women should automatically take on the responsibilities of child care and housekeeping in addition to a regular job (if they wish to even have a job on top of all these tasks). It's not easy for women, and Hesse-Biber uses several examples and hard data to back up this book.Not only is the ""average, white American supermom"" discusses, but also the differences in race, class, and other factors that can influence women's place in the ""working world.""The book is very useful and Hesse-Biber always takes a strong feminist perspective. One fault would probably be that she doesn't show both sides as best she could, but overall, the book is an enjoyable one."
4,Great Marrriage Book,Practical. Biblical. Helpful. I read it 25 years ago before getting married and again this year. It's an excellent book on the Biblical pattern for marriage.
5,This is what you want to save or improve your marriage!,"This book offers hope. It's an easy read, and gives the answers fast for those starving for answers to save their marriage, or just to improve it. Great lists of rules-write them down and carry them with you daily. Someday I look forward to reading his other works. Definately written by people who know what they are talking about firsthand."
1,Very poor sound,"Purchased these speakers based on price, which was very affordable. After testing them in the boat they sounded awful. Had to turn the stereo way up to get good volume. but by then they were distorting. Would not recommend this product. I am returning them."
4,Reversible for Left/Right hand,"Works great on thicker aluminum arrows as well as thin carbon arrows. Grips really good; haven't had it slip at all even when pulling hard with both hands.Completely reversible for left-handed people; even the quick-release retainer can be switched to the other end, or removed completely.One added benefit not listed: in really cold weather you won't have to grip those metal arrows with your bare hands. Keeps your hands just that little bit warmer."
4,A decent arrow puller,"I'm using Victory HV carbon arrows, and this arrow puller generally does a pretty good job of removing arrows I would otherwise be unable to retrieve. I've only encountered a few instances where I couldn't get enough grip on the arrow to remove it, and that was when the arrow was lodged deeply in a piece of wood. For 3D targets, wet or compacted bails of hay, this little arrow puller does a really good job. Can't really beat it for the price."
4,It works,What can I say? It works as advertised. My arrows are always buried deep into the targets and this little device gives just enough grip to pull the directly out.
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK,"This book stuns me with it's detail--Miller writes like someone taking a photograph. I feel absolutely THERE when reading it, and feel as if I know every single character personally. Miller has the uncanny ability to create an almost 'voyeuristic' atmosphere in her books. I can't help but feel these characters are living and breathing. One of my all time favourites. I can't recommend it highly enough."
4,I liked this book,"I thought this book was very good. It looked at family life and allowed a personal peek into a dysfunctional family. It showed love, fear, anger, betrayal, confusion, loyalty. All the feelings were real."
5,Painful and appalling yet beautiful,Miller did a wonderful job to decribe Eberhart family's struggle to maintain family homeostasis. I would definitely recommend to my friends who are interested in studying family dynamics.
4,Sue Miller's Great Work,"This book follows a Chicago family from just after WWII to the Reagan era, thru the Baby Boom years, Vietnam, the `70's and into the relative peace of the decade in which it concludes. A once tranquil Catholic family of six children is slowly undermined when the second son is born autistic. This is a story of people trying to cope and grab a share of normality while faced with a challenge that imposes abnormality onto them. The father, a psychologist, becomes increasingly distant from his wife and children; the mother, once the very model of a charismatic homemaker of the middle century, becomes a case study in smothering overprotectiveness; the oldest son feels neglected and rebels so deeply he leaves Harvard and goes to Vietnam; the main character, one of the middle daughters, spirals into drugs and a countercultural lifestyle. No one in this tale of creeping disintegration is left alone by life, or comes out unscathed."
4,Great starter scooter,"This scooter is great for a first-time scooter user. The third wheel provides the necessary support for the less-balanced inclined. However, the wheels/bearings themselves do slow the user considerably. If there are no other scooters for comparison, a 3-4YO should be content with this particular model for a long time.However, juxtaposed to a regular Razor (with its faster bearings/wheels), the Razor Kiddie Kick Scooter will not hold a toddler's attention. They will probably want to go faster with easier kicks on the ""bigger kid"" scooter."
1,A Total Waste of Money,"My 3yo son received a Razor Kiddie Kick scooter for his birthday, and it is such a piece of junk that we ended up throwing it away. He was so disappointed too, he had waited for months to get the scooter...the wheels have NO BEARINGS, just a plastic ring that rubs against the inside of the wheel and makes it impossible for the scooter to coast along, so he had to push and push and the scooter went so slowly that he got frustrated and finally gave up. We tried to replace the wheels with regular Razor wheels, but they are a different size, so we couldn't even fix it. We then contacted Razor, by phone and by email, and explained our disappointment, but they didn't return our calls or our emails.All in all, this scooter was a total waste of time and money."
4,"Thank you for this book, excuse my while I read it!","Cute book that reminds little learners how to ""mind their manners"", because they don't always remember what we tell them!"
5,Great for babies & toddlers!!,"I originally purchased this book as a gift, thinking it was too ""babyish"" for my 2 1/2 yr. old. But he saw it and loved it! The words are so simple to read and understand that it has become a great learning tool as he begins to focus on the letters and sounds of words. Great pictures and great ideas. It's really helped him understand how, when and why to say things like ""excuse me or thank you."""
5,Cute Book,"This is a great book that addresses manners in a fun and natural way. Pictures big, bright colors, pages are easy for baby to turn."
4,Cute Concept,"This is a cute book. Each page has a scenario and then asks ""What do you say?"". You life the flap to reveal the answer (e.g. Daddy asks, ""Do you want a treat?"" What do you say?, lift the flap to reveal the words ""Yes Please""). The flaps are large (the size of the page) and easy to lift.The book refers to mommy, daddy, little sister, and grandma so this may be confusing for some kids if they don't have these particular family members."
1,Think Again,Voice was excellent but the musical background made it difficult to hear.An accompaniment should supplement the voice of the singer; not obliterate it.I did not even finish one complete play of the CD.I regret the purchase.
2,What the heck is going on?,"They say you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. I think when they say that they mean some things are better than they look but the reverse holds true that what's inside the cover can be worse than the outside. When I picked up this book I was expecting a fun space opera, the premise certainly sounded exciting. A dozen races settling the solar system. An advanced technology beyond the reach of humanity. A ragtag band of mercenaries. A hunt to find the secrets of interstellar travel. Certainly sounded good to me when I bought it. But the resulting read was a confusing jumbled mess. Virtually the entire time I was reading it I was thinking: ""What the heck is going on here?"" The pacing seemed to have no rhythm whatsoever. I couldn't attach to the characters in any significant way. Only three races were mentioned and I couldn't make heads or tails of them. The premise was wasted on poor execution."
1,Confusing story...,I am an avid reader of SF and have to say this was just terrible. Concept is good but the writing just does not engage. I gave it up on page 110. Hate to give it even one star.
2,Steering Wheel Cover.,I chose a Steelers steering wheel cover. You can tell that the Steelers print isn't going to last long against someones grip on the steering wheel. It is going to easily wear off.
5,Tent was great,"The tent was easy to set up, very roomy and nice and high. The ventilation is very good. The weather was beautiful so I don't know how if it is as water proof as its supposed to be, but I would assume so. I like it very much and recommend it."
4,Excellent Resource,"I have just completed a graduate course in Assessment for teachers of ELLs. Almost all of the students in this class, including me, found this book to be a very valuable resource. Some of the information is redundant, but for a teacher looking for ideas on how to construct an authentic assessment of student work (reading, writing, speaking or listening) it is full of great insights and models that can be copied from the book or revised for individual use."
3,Warm and inspiring music - Even in another language,"This was an nice cd. The artist has great vocals. Although I do not understand the words very well, the music was warm and inspiring."
2,It had potential...,"Karen Haber's ""Bless the Beasts"" offers once again a Voyager story with a seemingly peacefull planet, with the seemingly friendly inhabitants turning out to be something else than they seem in one way or the other.No spoilers there I assume...The book has interesting settings and situations, but as a whole it's lame.Some information is flawed and inconsistant with the series and it's technology, and in the case of sensors, there's flawed information that affects the plot tramaticaly.It's a fast read, but nothing special."
4,Doc Reaches the Summit,"This disc is all about Doc Severinsen's electrifying performance of ""Five Episodes for Brass"" by Allen Vizzutti and Jeff Tysik. The Summit Brass was a vacation project for some college professors and lesser-known professional brass players--a tax-deductible golfing vacation in the Rockies--and their approach always seemed scholarly but sterile. Worse yet, the recording has a very dry acoustic, capturing none of the breadth and grandeur of the brass sound. Enter Doc Severinsen, with his trademark fat sound and high-energy interpretations. This is a more Classical Severinsen with all the jazz intact, and remains one of his best performances. Buy it if you love Doc."
3,Not too many different breeds in this book,I bought this book as a reference guide for my veterinary technician program. Im dissappointed with this book because it had very few different breeds but the breeds it did have just showed a million different colors that the cat could come in. Was hoping that the book had a variety of breeds that may be of help but it was not.
4,Works for CD's too,This stuff is very good at fixing scratched CD's that were once unplayable. Works great for light scratches.
1,super sawzall 13 amp breaks in 30 minutes,I took it out of the box put in a metal cutting blade and 30 minutes into cutting up metal sheeting it lost all its power to cut because I had purchased it from Amazon. com I had no where to return the brand new saw. I took it to a Milwaukee service center. I went to a pawn shop and bought a $60 sawzall and finished the job I had to complete. 2 weeks later I got my brand new sawzall back. I keep using the pawn shop specail because it works and driving back and forth to the repair shop wastes alot of a day.
3,"good shop vad, BUT this is NOT a quiet vacuum - read that part as ""FALSE A...""","Ok first the good since I think most people won't care about the sound level:It works well enough as both blower and vacuum.It's a shop vac. I don't see anything about it to make it stand out above the crowd though.If you just want a shop vac that matches the power rating and hose diameter with a drain, then it serves its purpose quite adequately.Now for the one extra item I thought might make it a better choice for me:From the ""Product Description""""eet; Operation Sound Level: Super Quiet; Hose Si""See those 2 words?""Super Quiet""?No!Wrong!It is not quiet at all.Super quiet would be a whisper or at least a soft roar.This is is not quieter than any other shop vac I have ever heard.I bet some marketing goon thought that 0.001 decibel quieter counts as ""super"" quiet.Personally I'm quite sick of this sort of BS, but I don't think there is much that can be done about it."
4,The Perfect Collection of Actionable Advises,"This books brings a new dimension to every negotiations. After reading it you are starting to see negotiations everywhere in your life, and tips and tricks listed here are really helpful. Lots of real-life examples also help to understand the material better.I'm sure that some of those tricks you already knew, and some of them seem just natural. But to have them all in one place is a big advantage.The most useful part of the book is its Section One. The other Sections just add to the length, and bring little additional value compared to their size."
5,Well worth the money !!,I read this book one month ago. I have already earned the price of the book. This book is a must if you like or need to negotiate.
3,Good,"Worth while having a listen to, but I must also recommend the following book:Bargaining for Advantage : Negotiation Strategies for Reasonable People by G. Richard Shellto help you fill in the gaps.These two used inconjunction with each other will give you an edge in negotiating in bussines and life.(hope this makes sense I cannot see what I amm typing)"
3,No Dialogue Picture Book with nice illustrations.,"Great simple illustrations. The only words that appear in this book are those from the little duckling, 'peep' and the surprise animal at the end. It is an easy flowing story that would be great for a young classroom to be able to write their own words and captions for each page.This book is about a duck who is born and finds a friend. They do everything together until the duck hears and sees other ducks. The boy realizes that he must let the duck be with his kind and brings him to a nearby pond. The boy begins missing him. He mopes. At the end of the story, he finds another friend."
4,I come back to this one again and again...,"This is a well done video. It is set outside on a cliff over the ocean, which is nice instead of a studio. As other reviews have already stated, it is a medium/intermediate challenge. Before buying you should know that there is only one workout on this video, which is why I gave it only 4 stars. However, I use this video at least once a week. The majority of the moves focus around doing planks, down into cobra, back up into down-dog, step into forward bend etc. She does many variations of this, some more challenging with one leg up."
2,Where was the editor?,"Actually, I couldn't finish the book. I started several chapters, but finally put it down in disgust. Where was the editor at Yale Press? The writing is terrible, more acceptable from a high school freshman than from a professor of history. My ex-wife is an instructor in English and composition, and I'm sure she would appreciate this book as a gift for its collection of bad examples. My advice - browse before you buy."
1,How did this pass through safety tests for kids?,"After my 4-year old BEGGED me for this thing, I caved in and purchased it before Christmas. It took FOREVER to figure out how to get the springing mechanism to work. You have to push it down in such an awkward way that I kept having to push it down for him...which isn't much fun. Then in order to get the ""jumping"" action, you practically have to throw the thing and literally slam it into something in order for the jumping action to start. Oh, but wait, there's a little area underneath that little tiny fingers can get trapped into....he nearly lost his finger!!!! HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE UNSAFE toy. NOT FOR KIDS UNDER THE AGE OF 8. What a waste of money."
5,Good Product,I ordered the Ameriphone P-300 Amplified Photo Phone for my 92 year old mother who is extremely hard of hearing and blind and lives in a nursing home. We put stickers of various textures on the speed dial buttons and she is able to use the phone quite well. She has sropped it numerous times in the two weeks she has had the phone and it continues to work perfectly. I have already purchased another item from this company as they were so easy to work with.
5,The best example of Sting's extraordinary range of talent.,"From a haunting ""The Wild Sea"", to an improvised ""Walking on The Moon"", this video is a vibrant example of Sting's vocal, lyrical, and musical talent. The texture of the video is soft and filtered, which complements the acoustic nature of the unplugged venue. This is an absolute must for Sting fans - as close is you will ever get to having a feel for what it must be like to have Sting play in your living room. Thanks Gordon for sharing your talent!!!"
2,Below the standard!,I'm sorry but this video is just too boring! I love Stings music and art - but this doesn't move a thing in me.
4,"Losing a bit of steam, but still wonderfully absurd","Not as strong as the previous 4 seasons, withe the ideas starting to run just a bit thin, this still has plenty of inspired lunacy for fans. The best of season 5's episodes include 'Dickesode'. 'Hand Banana', 'Party All the Time', and 'Antenna'.The rest are mostly pretty good, and a few decidedly weak.While this series has worn off a bit from when I was first enthralled by the sheer dada-esque insanity, the best episodes still transcend to amazing levels of bizarre, gross, surreal humor. When your starting premise is a giant talking shake, fries, and wad of meat living in New Jersey, how wrong can you go?"
1,Does not live up to ATHF standards,"I decided to add volume 5 to my collection, I have 1-4 and unfortunately it doesnt live up to the others at all. Some of the episodes were just pointless with jokes that fell short or made absolutely no sense. I'm a huge fan of Aqua Teen but I wouldnt bother to buy this volume. Get 1-4 or 7 as I have yet to see any of the others."
1,"Common cheap, different one(not large one as photo) delivered.","Because of high return charge, I can't return it. Here's South KOREA.I haven't a chance to use lagre size one, I can't compare two kinds.Also I can't rate this item."
2,Had to make an adapter,"It would not fit any of my three differently branded air mattresses. One was a Coleman brand. They really should test a product before selling it. It also seemed to pump slower than my foot pump. Mine may have been defective - after five minutes of rigorous pumping my queen 6"" mattress was only half full. I returned it because I had to use the hose from my other pump connected inline to get it to fit the air hole on my mattresses - which looked like a clusterpuff. Fairly useless - you may get lucky and it could inflate yours, but I wouldn't depend on it."
3,What a WORKOUT!,"Buy this if you enjoy some serious exercise cuz this aint no joke. The pump is well made, and it doesn't take forever to inflate or deflate, but after you pump one mattress, you'll feel like you just ran a quarter mile. Overall, it's a well made product, but its somewhat bulky and you have to make sure you dont crack the plastic hose, which will make the entire product worthless."
5,Handy pump,"Perfect for blowing up those inflatable kid toys like rafts, balls, mattresses. Works fine on inflation cells of kitesurfing kite. Works fine right out of the box."
4,Good Pump,"Great pump with the added benefit of a good work out. Purchased to fill mySevylor Fish Hunter Inflatable Boat. it does the job, but very tiring. Great pump though, pushes a lot of air."
3,What a workout!,"I bought the pump thinking it would be a great alternative to the battery operated pump...man was I wrong. It works really well, but being bent over to pump so long really killed my back. It's great for home use or car camping, but for primitive or hike ins, I think I'll invest in the battery operated pump. That said...the pump does work well."
5,great job,Great job . It came quickly and in great shape and it play very well. i will enjoy it for manny years.
4,Pretty good,"I had this DVD sitting on my shelf for a few years now. I had tried it a few times and just never got hooked. I've since started other exercise and with a bit more flexibility and core strength then I used to have, I decided to try Lotte Berk again. It's definitely not something that will everyone will like. You have to focus on what you're doing, the movements are small and precise, and you will feel a burn. I will stick with Pilates and Yoga as my primary ""core"" and flexibility work but I'll start adding Lotte Burk back into the mix now too."
5,A daily 30 minute workout for everyone and to be done at home,"Everyone can find 30 minutes, much of the movements can even be done while on the phone. This can be done 30 minutes before the rest of the family is awake, or while away. It's a must to have this DVD."
2,This instructor is beyond annoying,"I don't know how anyone can get into these work-outs. They are STRANGE. I wanted to punch the instructor in the nose. Her voice and cheesy way she spoke is enough to drive you bonkers. And the way she opens her eyes all wide and says ""Do you remember? Where do you feel it? Can you do it? Can you tuck??Yes you feel it!""The newage porno sounding music combined with the strange hypno gucci girl ballerinas was wacky. I'll stick with The Firm."
3,Quite a detailed account of the 1st Panzer corp,A little realised fact is that the battle of Normandy was no push over. The Germans fought very well and determination to stop the Allies. This book is as good a discussion as you will get on the fighting.I got loss in the details. I felt after awhile that I was just reading stories of battle scenes.
3,"Started out promising, but...","I don't know, usually, as I've said in previous reviews of Marsh's mysteries, even the ones that don't seem to be as good prove at least satisfying. Here, this doesn't seem to be the case. Maybe I was just slow, but the plot really didn't seem to run as smoothly as it usually does in her books, which is a shame since the characters are quite well-drawn. A wealthy widow commits suicide at a well-known spa/health hotel. Did she do it because she was angry with her daughter or because she suspected that she herself may have an incurable disease? The question soon becomes, did she commit suicide at all? It's up to Detective Inspector Alleyn and his trusty side-kick, Inspector Fox, to get to the bottom of this grave."
5,Wow - These are Strong!!,"I wasn't quite prepared for how strong these were and ended up pinching my fingers a few times. I'm using them to attach some items to clothing in place of pins, so they need to be strong to be secure."
4,the technique,"The techniques is very good, but the stretching is not in slow motion.The pictures are not bad. Is there another DVD?"
3,This is not a toy! It is a collectible doll!,"This doll is absolutely beautiful, she is not a toy, she is collectible!She also shipped really super duper fast!"
1,Garbage,This book is garbage! Don't waste your money on the lies sold in this book. If you want to read fantasy? I suggest the Lord of the Rings. The makers of this book and the movies should be ashamed of themselves for profiting off so many lies masqueraded as truths.
1,Ramtha ate my brain,"Should have been a pop-up book so as not to confuse people with all those words strung together. Thinking for ourselves is dangerous, let's all hide under Ramtha's skirt and see if she says it's all right to come out.Cliff-Notes For the Retarded"
5,Nice companion to the movie,"I bought this after seeing the movie- Helps me understand the concepts involved, its a great companion!"
4,A Must read for those interested in the limits of man's knowledge,"This book is fascinating. It is also thought-provoking.It is the kind of book that takes you to the very edge of present knowledge in a variety of areas. It asks questions that sound far out and then attempts to answer them.Almong all of the latest information on the topics, the authors give someof their opinions and thoughts and how working on and creating this book has influenced them and their thinking.This book will intrigue anyone who likes science, the limits of man's knowledge, where we may be going etc.J. Robert Ewbank, author of ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,great,very interest ing and said in a way that a novice can understand.It was a distraction to me to have the boxed in material that did not relate to what was being said in the body of the page.
3,"Good accessary bundle, but could be improved","The accessory kit is pretty good. The camera bag could be improved. The batteries and charger are great. I would prefer a better designed camera bag. It fits a little too tight, you have to make sure the rubber diopter ring doesn't pop off when you pull out the camera. You can make more room by removing a padded square from inside top of the bag. A side pouch that could hold an extra memory card is more desirable than the penholders."
1,lost opportunity,I would love to have seen this subject handled by a more insightful and skilled filmmaker. It's regrettable that this tedious mess will be part of Ram Dass's legacy.
2,"Not good, kinda funny though...","As you probably know by now, ""A Biography"" was never released in the U.S., and on first listen, it's easy to see why.This is not the Mellencamp you know. This isn't even the Johnny Cougar you know.This sounds like a collection of all the bad late 70's cliches you can recall, and in that manner, it's funnier than hell.The songs are weak, the production thin, and he sounds like a kid.Which he probably was.However, if you are as big a Mellencamp fan as I am, you'll need to get this record. It's like seeing his high school yearbook...a glimpse into the person you are more familiar with."
4,Not the best band but great arrangements,This album is not one of Buddy's best because of the band. The trumpet section has real pitch problems. The trombones and saxes are good. If it were not for the band I would give this album a 5 star rating. The arrangements are great and solid big band style. It sounds much like what Maynard Ferguson would have done. If you are a serious Buddy Rich Fan you will want this album for your collection simply for the arrangements.
5,Corsair 2GB Memory,"I have no complaints whatsoever. The shipping was fast, the install was easy, and the product works fantastic! I would recommend if you're looking for some memory at a good price."
2,Ok.. But not great.,"I had figured the series was done with the previous book. When I found this book at the book store, I was like ""I must get it"". Now, I could have easily waited, and so could have M[r]s. McCaffrey. In my oppinion, this book is only half done. When I reached the last page, I was still expecting more pages. Somewhat dissapointing, I hope she chooses to finish this book with the same attention and care she uses for her other books."
3,More research needed,"When an author uses jargon that has a history, it's use is expected to be consistent with past practice.Specifically, I noted Ms McCaffrey's misuse of military radio procedures which are quickly found on the internet. The phonetic for the letter B has not been ""Baker"" since WWII. The use of ""Sugar"" for S was taken from thin air. The correct military phonetic letters would be Bravo and Sierra. In addition ""over"" and ""out"" are never to be used together - except maybe in an old Ronald Reagan movie."
2,Not up to the rest of the series,This book left a lot to be desired after the first 3 in the Freedom Series. I kept on reading in hopes that it would become more interesting but it didn't. There are a couple of plot starts that dribble away and don't go anywhere. I hope there will be a 5th in the series and that it will be more interesting.
4,a good buy,a tool very versatile and comfortable. field-tested with excellent results.I add a lanyard for more security.
4,Hilarious,"Our family has really enjoyed watching this DVD set. It is old shows rebroadcast rather and has no new material, which is why I am only giving 4 stars."
1,At no fault to the manufacturer,"Be cautious when ordering that you are actually ordering more than just the mounting pieces, that are sold seperately from the actual product. The images are deceptive."
4,Too Out There,"I read other Sonny Baca stories and liked them. Even though I still liked this story, there was too much dream world."
4,Love the cinnamon!,"I love the cinnamon taste of this toothpaste. I just wish Tom's would make this in a non-fluoride form, but until then I will be using Tom's other flavors of fluoride free toothpaste."
1,Seth dropped the ball,Someone seriously dropped the ball releasing this garbage. Watching JLo in Gigli is less painful than watching this.
3,funny but too short,I am a crazy seth macfarlane fan and ordered this as soon as i heard about it. I was disappointed to see that it was only about 45 minutes long and all unrelated shorts about 10 seconds long. But i must say that the material is still very funny for the most part. Basically pretty good but had the potential to be much better.
1,I thought I should have been laughing,I laughed at the first few sketches because I knew I was watching something that Seth MacFarlane created so I figured it was funny. I then realized that they weren't funny at all and were just sort of confusing. After about 20 minutes into it I turned it off because it was just dumb. Don't waste your money. If you really wanna see it just download it.
2,Not as great as I had hoped,"My husband and I love Family Guy so we were really excited about this. I don't have a prblem with all the short skits, but they just aren't that funny! I expected more great writing, but it just seemed that these skits were just the grossest most politically incorrect ideas they could think of. I'm no prude, but I didn't not laugh much at all, especially not like episodes of Family Guy. My husband walked out during it to make a call and he loves ""boy humor"". Just not what we expected...."
1,Awful. Don't But This.,"I love Family Guy and American Dad, but this ""movie"" has less laughs in an hour than 5 minutes of either of those shows. The skits range from mildly funny to horrendously offensive and tasteless. Probably the worst DVD I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Self-indulgent crap which substitutes trash and filth for actual jokes. I would give it zero stars if I could."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I've been a fan of Seth for years and I looked forward to this disk to be released. But now that I've watched it I feel cheated. It would be more accurate to title this, ""Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Bits not Funny Enough to be on the Least-Funny Episodes of Family Guy."" I got a few *slight* grins out of it (very slight) but mostly I found myself thinking how I had just wasted $15. If you really feel you *have* to see this, either rent it or look for it in the dollar bin around mid-summer. Or maybe even next month. What a rip."
1,Ouch.,"I can't add much to what's already been said about this DVD. And speaking as a big fan of Family Guy, and a moderate-sized fan of American Dad, this collection is just painful to watch. If you must see it, rent it through Netflix or something."
4,"Yeah it's pricey, but it's pretty funny...","OK, if you aren't a die-hard Family Guy fan, if you don't like the jokes that go on for a little TOO long or the jokes that normally start with ""like that one time when Peter..."" this isn't for you...That aside, if you like all the side gags on family guy where they trail off to something that is completely off subject, this IS for you. To me, this disc is filled with the things Seth couldn't find space for in a Family Guy episode or that the FCC would have a stroke over if they did. I absolutely love Family Guy and the fact that they don't care too much about being politically correct...it's refreshing and this disc stays true to that. It's raunchy, just wrong sometimes, and pretty hilarious all at the same time.I didn't give it 5 stars because it's a little pricey for only an hour's worth of fun. Enjoy!"
1,This Guy Has Completely Run Out of Ideas,"Extremely disappointed that this disc was even published, has such a lack of ideas it begins to repeat itself in the short 50 minutes it runs. Yes Seth, we get it, gays are funny and the south is backwards and some people talk with accents. It wasnt funny the first eight times you tried it in Family Guy, it still isn't funny now that you've run out of ideas on Family Guy and repeat these same jokes every episode, (wH , bumped knee, Conway Twitty, really?) but to try and pawn the same material which has already worn itself out in syndication as 'new' product to be sold is offensive to consumers. If you enjoy this product you might want to watch Idiocracy, as you ARE the future."
1,Not even once,"I did not laugh, chuckle, or even grin once during the 54 minutes duration of the cavalcade. The funniest part of the cavalcade is the word cavalcade if that tells you anything. A common theme through all the shorts is gross out humor which I think is usually pretty funny, not sure what was missing... I guess even gross out humor needs to have some semblance of a plot or a point at least. If you are curious try to find some of the shorts on the web for free, not worth spending any money on."
4,"Short, a little overpriced, but very good anyway.",You need put aside the fact that all the videos are available in the YouTube and that the total length of the DVD is quite short. Anyway you still end up with some very funny and worth material.
2,watch on youtube don't waste money,"well looks like these were family guy, american dad rejects that seth macfrlene did'nt use so he decided to throw these lame concepts on this cd it would have been funnier if they were used on american dad.the wile coyote skit is cool but anything else."
3,"Good, but definitely no Family Guy","This collection of shorts by Seth Mcfarlane is enjoyable, but it isn't as funny or clever as Family Guy or American Dad. It has it's share of hits and misses, but if you're a fan of Seth's, get it."
1,cavalcade of cartoon comedy,this must be the worst animated programme /dvd that seth mc farlane as done it in my estimation is a pile of crap only watched 10 minutes of it and could watch no more i put it on ebay and sold it on rating out of rating out of 10 2/10
3,Ok... not what I expected,This is a strange Ab video . I have only done it twice but for like 10 mintes you do push ups I dunno I guess a lot of people liked it but it is not my favorite. I recommend the Barre Method or Calenetics I like them as instructors better even though Callen is a little goofy.
3,"ALTHOUGH ""HURTS SO GOOD"" IS AN UNDENIABLE CLASSIC...","... ""Thundering Hearts"" has always been the undisputable killer track on this recording... by contrast, how ""Jack & Diane"" became such a huge hit when it sounded like a half-baked b-side would make for an interesting episode on ""Unsolved Mysteries""... and as for ""Weakest Moments"", it was a throwaway that should have never been included on this album to begin with. Overall, a solid album distinguished by Mike Wanchic's guitar work which would figure prominently as part of Mellencamp's trademark sound."
5,Barton's Best,"I am a four year old black lab guide dog. It is essential in my line of work that I stay fit. You could have fooled me, low fat, really now, my nose knows no difference. I recommend these yummy treats to both working dogs like myself and other dogs looking for a healthy and ""good for you"" treat!!!"
4,not a good choice for young readers,"The following text made me rethink my plans to give this book to my third-grade nephew: ""A few years after Nicholas was ordained bishop, a man who kept an inn on the outskirts of the city murdered three youths and then hid them in a tub of brine..."". Not exactly bedtime story material. So, I'll set it aside to give to him when he is a bit older. In the mean time, I did give him Paul Prokop's book The True Story of Santa Claus which I think is more appropriate for a younger audience."
3,OK for beginners and not too basic for experienced developers,I think Lars and M. Hawley's reviews are right on. I was pretty disappointed with this book. Most of it seemed to be pretty much common sense. Don't get me wrong I did learn some from this book. The first few chapters had some decent content but as the chapters went on I was hoping it would focus more on design and technical aspects. If you're looking for the basics then this book is good but if you're an experienced (even moderately) developer then I think you will be disappointed.
2,Boring,"If you think the word anectdotal on the cover blurb means entertaining FORGET IT. This is a sociological book and not "" romp"" through the lives of the rich and famous."
3,Good on some channels and bad on others.,"The Jensen 910 is good on some channels but very poor on others.After about a week of use, the light bulb burned out behind the blue Jensen nameon the lower right of the platform. Made in China."
3,Wish these were still on TV...,"This is it! That great first episode when Superman comes to Earth. Great fun, good fiction, campy directing. Who could ask for more. There is a cartoon between 2 George Reeves episodes. The cartoon is clever but not nearly as much fun."
2,VERY SLOW with few reps,"This is the slowest video I have ever seen. I am surprised to see positive reviews about this video. The instructor shows you no less than 3 times how to get into position, and then you do all of 4 reps, then release. She then says ""Where did you feel that? In your thighs, right?"" Thank goodness she points that out, or you might think squats are an arm exercise (sarcasm). I can't imagine anyone doing this video more than once, as there is only 10 minutes of actual exercise on the video, and the rest is chit-chat. I gave this video 2stars only because I appreciate that a real person actually put effort into this. If you have never done any type of exercise before, and want to kid yourself that this is a 'workout', you could try this, but really, why? There are so many better options out there."
2,a big let down!,"I was not at all impressed with this book. The carachters were too shallow. I never really felt like I was totally connecting with them. I absolutely could not stand Leslie, the heroin. She had no backbone to speak of, and Flint totally rode roughshod over her through the entire book. The book had a terrific story line and I even Liked Flint, but it just left me with no 'feeling' at all. This is the only book by Joan Hohl that I haven't liked. I'm normally a really big fan of hers. I've read several of her books. However, this book most certainly was not up to her usual standards. I would not recommend anyone waste their money on it. If you want to read a good Joan Hohl, then I suggest ""Ever After"" now that was an entertaining romance!"
1,"Teared and dirty inner box, and no expired time.","I ordered one several weeks ago. The inner box is dirty and teared. Obviously, It is not a new one.I hate this item."
4,perfect for your desk,The stand is perfect for your desk but the round padded part comes off the front and doesn't stay in place when it's on your lap. It's very light weight and it really does make a difference when you're typing.
3,Decorative but not too usefull,"Serious animal people, eager to find elegant subsitutes for the dog-crate end tables, will be dissapoited. I was. This book is pretty photos of pets in pretty homes, as decorative art. There were a few good ideas, mostly one chapter."
5,FOUR-PAWS UP!!!!!!,"MEOW! The only decorating book I've ever read that treats animals as companions worthy of consideration when making design decisions. If you live with a couple of cool cats and want to recover your sofa, Szabo let's you in on some trade secrets. (Ultrasuede, for instance, is a sure way to discourage scratching.) Beautifully illustrated and intelligently written and reported, the book is filled with tons of useful tips and entertaining anecdotes. Thankfully, the writer always puts pets before possessions but teaches us how to create beautiful living spaces without sacrificing style. Truly enlightened perspective makes this a must read for any animal owner who cares about design and decoration."
5,Cult Classic but not for the light at heart like TJ,"Ok first of all you can tell this is a shoe string budget.The story is all over the place so don't blink, I got it better the second round but it was entertaining enough to watch a few times.Brace yourself for a brash movie maker from Estonia that will try to be controversial (not sure I always got his point if he had one).The cast was awesome to bad everyone dies so no hope for a part 2.What ever you do don't turn it off in the first ten minutes which is a little boring and confusing (most of which could have been left on the floor but I think the director also has a fantasy about making a classic war movie so he drags it on forever) it is a setup that will be paid off heavily in the end.All in all it is entertaining but not sure I'll make it a point to watch this film makers movies in the future but I really enjoyed the acting even if the script needed help."
3,Still cool Kirby,"Kirby is cute as always. Like the other Kirby DVD I reviewed it's okay, but still a little wierd. It is good, because of Kirby, the villains, Meta Knight being good, so I guess I reccomend this."
5,Pefect gift with a ideal cut that will knock her socks off.,"This necklace did not disappoint. It had a ideal cut that reflects light wonderfully for the glimmer you love to see especially on a sunny day.I gave this as a gift to my fiance and she loved it. Not to mention it had free shipping to boot. This made a great present, plus NETAYA and amazon gave me great updates so I knew the delivery was prompt along the way."
4,Uta Hagen Acting Class DVD,"I initially purchased this product because I was alerted to the fact that Robert Gant (of Queer as Folk fame) participated in it; but it was really a lot more entertaining on many other levels. She is a very insightful woman and the DVD is funny, provoking and just plain entertaining. There are a few well-known faces that pop up but the actual acting exercises are great to watch; even if you're not an aspiring thespian!Check it out."
2,This is Aluminum wire,This Speaker Wire has in fact 20 AWG! with respect to its resistance. It has almost 2 times higher resistance in compare with regular 18 AWG copper speaker wire. You may ask me Why? Because this is copper-clad aluminum wire not pure copper! I have done all measurements in my lab very accurate. After that I scratch out the copper layer and saw white metal. I think this is supplier's trick rather than seller. Waste money and time.
4,it's early for this ensemble...but STILL...,"This is the oldest available CD featuring Michael Posch and Thomas Wimmer. They go on to become members of Accentus/Oni Wytars/Unicorn, easily the most formidable early music instrumental ensemble in existence. Here, their skills certainly aren't what they'll become. But even amid their slightly hesitant and unrefined playing, their phenomenal musical spirit shines through. Thomas Wimmer is the only early musician I've heard who can sound so compelling with so little technique! I wouldn't recommend this CD as authentic Sephardic music (which isn't verifiably medieval), but it's a welcome addition to any collection solely on the basis of its engaged arrangements and presentation. The earliest tender shoot of a grand tree..."
5,Sony 4x6 Print Paper (120 Pack),"Great product, I have been using the paper for over a year now. I have never had any problems with this paper in my Sony photo printer (DPP-FP95)."
3,"Great info, SLOW software","I've found the articles in Britannica to be immensely informative, but the software is horribly slow. I used to have the Britannica 2000 DVD, and still would if it worked under XP. 2000 ran off the DVD and was still much, much faster in loading and searches than 2003. This program runs from the harddrive, and even with a high end computer (incl. 512MB DDR RAM), the searches are unbearably slow."
2,Nowhere as good as vol 1 or 2,"This is the latest from the ruff ryders, and I have to say I don't really like it. I wasn't really fellin this CD, and the only 2 good songs are Dirty, and They ain't ready. This is like the weakest attempt by the Ruff Ryders to make money, and DMX's song ain't all that great ether. If I where u, I'd download the 2 songs I mentiond, cuz this is a waste of money. This reminds me of the godfather saga, the forst was the best, and the third was garbage, and this reminds me of just that."
2,It's OK,"Bought the skins for my nephew, and he used them for about a week, then took them off, stating he didn't like having them on. No specific reason other than he just didn't like the feel."
3,Silicone Skin,The Silicone Skin didn't fit the Wii remote very well and the quality was average. It works but I have purchased better.
1,"If I could rate it lower than a 1, I would.","Were I involved with this project, I would have been embarrassed to release it. Quite frankly, one of the worst commercially released films I have ever seen.Forget any bias one might have about the subject matter. This is strictly a commentary on the production values and the craftmanship (or lack thereof) executed in the making of this film. Every facet of this film- the writing, the cinematography, the acting, the effects, the pacing - are just downright bad."
4,Hooked me right away. Couldn't put it down.,"This story about a spoiled rich Jewish teenager in Canada being uprooted to emmigrate to Israel around the time of the 6-Day Arab Israeli war is written in a way that pulls you into her struggles.She must cope with the enormous change in lifestyle and come to grips with the shallowness of her previous value system versus the reality of living on the edge of hatred, war and annihilation. She rejects, but later embraces her Jewish heritage."
3,Not the best season but still . . .,"Spread out over two dvds, this fifth season of Def Poetry is not necessarily the best of the bunch. There are some wonderful moments (Alicia Keys and Nikki Giovanni) and some unsurprisingly good moments (Suheir Hammad and Beau Sia both returning along with some others) but over all the ""big name"" guests left me wondering what was the point? Personally, I would have rather seen some younger unknown artists than clutter the stage with someone's fame."
4,Don't get me wrong.....,"Now don't get me wrong. This is a wonderful book with beautiful photographs of Native Plants and Animals of Hawaii. The only thing wrong with the Softcover version is that the cover creases so easily. So if you want this book for your own personal library the Hardcover version is preferred. But if it is used as it is meant to be, as a coffee table book, than this is the book to have."
4,a good reference,"This is a reprint of a well-written grammar of the Arabic variety spoken in Baghdad, Iraq. Despite its old-fashioned descriptive line, it offers a good and precise characterization of Iraqi Arabic syntax and phonology and shows the author's good knowledge and in-depth research into this dialect. I recommend it for both researchers and learners."
5,Fabulous!,That's the word for this cookbook. Every recipe I have attempted has been a winner the first time prepared. The meals I have presented from this cookbook have pleased some very tough critics.
2,For young readers,"I am a seventh grade science teacher and I am always looking for great story books to recommend to my students. However, I was disappointed with this story. The reading level is low and the simplicity of the writing is better for students around ages 9-10 than the advertised middle school level. The story moves quickly without great transitions or character development. The author has some interesting ideas that deal with half-creatures and singing, but there is a lack of development and explanation for what kind of world these characters are living in. If you need an easy and fast moving story to develop your student's reading ability, then I recommend this book."
2,pricey for what it is,"Not impressed. I've been to a few classes at one of Baron's studios and really enjoyed it, but this DVD doesn't quite do it for me. It's only 30 minutes, and for the price it feels like a rip off. I've spent less for DVDs with longer routines, or multiple 30 minute routines, and been happier. I'm new to yoga - definitely a beginner, and this STILL wasn't anything new and there was zero challenge.I expected more."
5,Good one,It's a good one my son love watching it.He watch it over and over.It's better than other version because the movie is as close to scriptures the other version we watch has scenes that is not in the scriptures.
3,Not what I expected,It took too much time getting into the story. For an older child it might be good. For my 5 year oldgreat granddaughter not so much.
2,disappointing text,"I found this text rather disappointing. My Vietnamese teachers, who are both Northern and Southern, pointed many flaws in the dialogues, mixing formal and informal idioms which is inappropriate, the use of idioms that no one else apparently has ever heard of, and a failure to cover important basics. We used the text, but it was really the skill of the teachers that made it workable. This text appears to be supported by various organizations, but I am not sure why, quality does not appear to be the reason.I have since discovered Ngo's text, which seems much better."
1,Don't waste your time!,"If you really want to understand bill gross, this overly wordy substanceless book is the last place to go. Go to PIMCO's website and read through all of the past investment outlooks he has put out. This book promises something nuanced and wonderful and never delivers. Aside from some interesting biographical information about the man, there is nothing that will improve your mind in this book that you can't get out of a PIMCO prospectus. If you are a serious student of the market, you will be sorely disappointed."
1,Hype & Fluff from MSNBC's Middleton,"Gross is an excellent bond trader (and thats the key word, he actively trades, PIMCO trades) no doubt about it, but Middleton makes a read much like Bonners ""Financial Reckoning Day"" he just keeps repeating his mantra: Total Return.In total honesty you could summarize this book in the following words: active buying and selling of bonds will give you ""total return."" What counts as total return is the coupon and the price you make from selling. There are no ""secrets"" as alleged on the slick paper wrapper and there is very little ""Gross."" Its all Middleton's fluff and it looks like he would do quite well in a prior era where people were paid by the word."
3,Fading fast,"While I thoroughly enjoy the series, the relationships in the last two seasons seem not to grow deeper but more caustic. The mothers duplicity is regrettable while the brothers angry tone toward Ray is more re-current. While I realize ""it is only a sit-com"" I experienced less laughter and more 'ouch' moments via the family dialogue.Fading fast - the better seasons are 3-6 as the characters are growing in their development."
3,Needs Alot of Work,"I wanted to get a 1/144 Alex, and at the time this was the only one out. For the price it is worth it, but to make it look good, the model needs a lot of painting. It's doesn't even have eye stickers."
1,don't buy,Don't buy this gundam. It is horrible. It breaks so easily. Not meant for play (duh). It has parts that don't fit on. The pieces break so easily. Don't buy. It also looks bad.
4,BLIND MAN'S BLUFF,IT TAKES YOU BACK TO A SIMPLER TIME IN MOVIES. MUCH MORE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE MOVIE WAS IN THE ACTING RATHER THAN TECHNOLOGY. IT WAS THE SUSPENSE AND DRAMA OF THE MOVIE THAT I ENJOYED.
2,Watch for condition!,The condition of this book was supposed to be new. The cover was ripped and faded. How am I supposed to give this as a gift? I was not impressed with this dealer.
1,"I'm a die-hard, but this is bad... :(","Regretably, the latest is actually NOT the greatest in the series. There is just *way* too much recycling of old material from the previous films.It lacks the wackiness of their earlier stuff. It's over-produced and uninspired. There are still a few priceless Brandon and Raab moments and Bam tearing up FDR (skate park) is impressive, but that's about it.Don't pick this up as your introduction to CKY. In my opinion, CKY Landspeed and CKY2K are the best, so do yourself a favour and start with that era."
3,Where's Mike Douglas when you need him?,"Having been a fan of the Cavett show as a kid, I was really looking forward to this set, especially after reading all the glowing reviews. It's definately a great time piece and it's kind of fun seeing what talk shows were like 30-40 years ago. However, what most reviews fail to mention is what a lousy interviewerDick Cavett really was. He's usually awkward and uninformed, his jokes are lame and unfunny and he creates more uncomfortable moments for his guests than any talk show host I've ever seen."
4,Essential material is missing,"I have a VHS tape of the post-Woodstock performances of Joni Mithchell, Jefferson Airplane, David Crosby and Stephen Stills on the Dick Cavett Show. Hendrix was invited, but was passed out in his hotel room (as per David Crosby) since he had performed that AM at Woodstock. When Joni Mitchell finished singing Chelsea Morning"", Cavett introduced Jefferson Airplane, who performed ""We Can Be Together"" followed immediately by ""Volunteers"". After some chat (during which Stephen Stills sang ""4 and 20,"" we found out that Grace Slick's father was an investment banker, and that Grace attended Finch College for one year with Tricia Nixon. When asked by Cavett why she somehow had not turned out like Tricia Nixon, Grace said ""it takes two years."" [LOL]) The Airplane concluded the show with ""Somebody to Love"" and went into an extended jam as the credits rolled. What is needed is the two Airplane songs that were left out."
5,Thanks for the memories!!,"This is a wonderful trip down memory lane. I had seen these shows when they originally aired, but I think I enjoy them even more now. The DVD's are wonderfully produced and I particularly like that they are uncut. You get the entire show. If there is anything I could wish for it would be for more ""behind the scenes"" commentary. Otherwise a gret collection!"
5,Good reference for biology,"I found this book to help a lot when studying the structure of DNA, Genetics and five kingdoms. I was assigned Campell's Biology for my undergrad biology 1 and 2 classes. Although this textbook had every topic imaginable about college biology, I found Biology Made Simple easier to comprehend. I also usedThe Ultimate Study Guide for Biology: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations by Patrick LeonardiVol 1Vol 2Vol 3These last three study guides were so good for preparing me for the type of questions to look out for on my bio midterms and finals. They helped me get excellent grades."
2,repeat...repeat...repeat,"I actually agree with the author's basic premise that the public education system is too worried about everything except the academic education of our children. I started reading this book prepared to nod my head and say, ""uh, huh"" while agreeing with his clever way of stating what I already think.I read the first several chapters and then just started skimming over headings. The author, while clearly passionate about his subject matter, keeps saying the same thing over and over. Perhaps, as publically educated readers, he believes we will not understand his message unless he states in 200 times in 100 different ways.I would be very interested in reading a new, abridged, version of this book where Mr. Skyes states his ideas just one time--clearly enough to be understood by his target audience (who I never could honestly identify.)"
4,"Great tunes of course, but...","Why couldn't Yusuf bust out with a bit more of a completist set? Anyway, the material here is excellent. fantastic outtakes, some cool live tracks. Excellent remastering. Too bad about the... liner notes though. Provides a bit of insight into Cat/Yusuf's dopey search for faith. But he oversaw the production of this set (and we should be grateful that his repressive beliefs allowed him to acknowledge his past career at all) so we are treated to astounding awakenings such as his getting... out in the So California surf and pleading with god for rescue to be answered with a saving wave (I live here--happens all the time) and then after toting buddhas and every other icon under the sun his brother gives him a Qu'ran (thanks, bro!) and then he of course turns away from the beautiful organic spirituality of his past to pump out boring didactic swill about as exciting as the Christian Billboard chart-toppers (ok, his is a bit better!)."
5,Texas Widow,"A wonderful read. Ms Hagen blends historical accuracy, action and romance with a deft touch. The rawness of the Old West is realistic while at the same time she adds the small details of home life on the frontier. The story drew me in, kept me turning pages until the end and left me longing for more. I look forward to reading more from this talented author."
4,McGuffey's 4th Electic Reader,"Great book for teaching reading, grammar and phonetics. My son was asking for us to hurry and get to the next story."
3,Finally Home,"King-Gamble expertly provides a very descriptive prose and imagery of upstate New York and the town of Syracuse. There is a lot going on in this novel that leans more towards the side of romance than it does suspense. However, with a history lesson that includes reflections of the Underground Railroad and its depots, the author captures the readers' attention.Reviewed by Dawn R. Reevesof The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersComplete review can be found on our website..."
5,Well Done Video that opens many doors,"The voyage from Blacksburg, Virginia to Nepal takes many forms and brings two worlds closer together. Jane Vance's painting is a master piece as it captures the life of Amchi Tsampa. The Villagers are touched by our lives here in our Mountains in Virginia. We also feel a closeness to Tsampa and his greater family in Nepal. Unique. Tom Landon and Jenna Swann are to be commended for their production skills. It is a film about much more than paintings, April 16 in Blacksburg, and life in Nepal. It is about the human spirit that is part of us all."
4,A must read for those who care about democracy in the U.S. and don't know what happened in the 2004 election,"A great amount of controversy surrounds the 2004 Presidential election, and nowhere is that controversy more intense than in Ohio. Though thousands or perhaps millions of people believe that the election was stolen, most people aren't even aware of the controversy, because it is hardly mentioned by conventional news sources.That is why this book is so important. Election fraud is a viscious cycle because it is used to elect representatives who will keep the cycle going. An informed public is the only defense we have against this attack on our democracy.I just read a review that said this book is devoid of facts. In truth the book is filled with facts. Maybe that person meant 'devoid of facts that I believe'. In any event, the book is truly shocking with respect to the tactics that were used in this election.Don't believe that this is true? Read the book and judge for yourself."
3,coleman trekking pole- tips,"The concept of this product is good. I have used it 4 times. Has helped with joints...I have arthrists (sp) and when I finished with my 2 mile walk I did not ache as badly......however.....the tips are a hard plastic and slide on hard services. Product should be replaced with the rubber, slope design to prevent slipping. I have not been able to locate replacement tips."
1,Useless for garage 50' away,"the transmitter can not reach 50' away and through 2 walls the garage and the kitchen, it either shows a false reading or none at all"
1,good idea but very limited range,"The range for this garage door monitor is very limited. The transmitter and the receiver pair cannot going through 20 feet with two brick walls (one brick wall is the garage and the other brick wall is the house). Otherwise, the pair works perfectly. This is completely useless."
4,Very pleased I have it ...,"Purchased this unit over a year ago, my garage is detached and the door faces away from the house ... cannot see if it's open unless I went out and trod halfway down the walk (CNY winter weather can make that painfully cold). I trust this unit ... it has gotten confused sometimes, blinking between red and green, but otherwise flawless ... did have to secure it with more/stronger velcro, the garage is unheated and the door too cold to hold it ... distance I have it is about 30 ft from the house/receiver."
3,Chamberlain CLDM1,I do like knowing when my garage door is left open by mistake but I noticed the indicator lights keep flashing even when the door is closed. When the door is open the red light does stay on.It does work. I just don't why the lights suddenly started to flash.
1,Short Lifespan,Love these when they're working. Have gone through 2 of these in 2 years. They just dont last for some Reason (CHINA).
1,Don't waste your money.,"I purchased this item foolishly ignoring the warnings of other reviews. We have a small house (1550 sq feet) so I thought that the range wouldn't be an issue. WRONG! The distance from my garage door to the monitor is probably about 45 feet. The monitor CONSTANTLY loses contact with the transmitter. There are two walls (well, really one wall and a door) between the transmitter and receiver. Not much interference. I have tried a couple of locations, but in my case there is no were practical to mount the receiver making this item is pretty much worthless."
4,AUseful Monitor,This Garage Door Monitor works well. My garage is detached and about 200 feet from mu house. The monitor is reliable in telling my if my garage door is open or closed.
2,"Great idea, poor product.","This unit has an effective range of 10 feet. I have replaced the batteries. I have also moved interfering RF devices such as wireless access points, cordless phones, cells. I am using this system with the original CLDM1 transmitter/receiver pair and a CLDM2 add on transmitter for a second garage door. The receiver is placed on the second floor directly above the garage doors. There is approximately 10 feet between the transmitters and the receiver, through a hard wood floor and sub-flooring. There are no large metal objects that might interfere with the communication around the transmitters or receiver. Receiver constantly looses communication with the transmitters. Great idea, poor product!"
5,Works exactly as advertised.,I've had this installed for 6 weeks & it works flawlessly. I didn't want an alarm that beeps because sometimes I want the garage door open and don't want to be bothered by a beeping alarm. I mounted it on a wall where it can be easily seen. Now I can tell at a glance if I forgot to close the door. I did have to use an extension cord because the supplied cord is not long enough. My garage is attached so the unit only has to transmit a distance of about 25 feet. I don't know how well it would work over greater distances.
1,Piece of Junk from China,"Chamberlain should be ashamed to place their name on this thing. The price should be lowered and sold at the dollar store with all the other Chinese junk. In eleven months, it simply stopped working one day. Flashed red and green simultaneously meaning it cannot receive a signal from the garage door module. I tested the 2032 battery and it is strong. It could not even find it a foot away. Buy another brand."
5,works great,"When I purchased this I was worried that my bedroom might be too far from my garage - its about 100ft, but the signal comes in just fine. works great."
1,"Great idea, but....","Great idea, but if it doesn't work...Bought one - worked out of the box - only had one false alarm - didn't have a range problem. But it stopped working one day - blinks red and green. Got a new battery, never got it to work again. So, I bought another one. This one has never worked. It was blinking red and green out of the box. Have tried different batteries, read and re-read the instructions (pushed the reset button). My guess - the transmitters fail. Now I have two units - neither works. If anyone wants, I'll sell them to you, at a great price - two for the price of one."
4,tintin,sorry for the delay in letting you know it arrived safely and was enjoyed. Thanks so much it was a cute show
3,Too long,The dog is adorable. The characters are interesting. I really can't say a thing wrong with this movie except it should have been only 45 minutes! I kept falling asleep! I'm pretty sure it would not hold the interest of a child.
1,Boring,I could not even sit through the entire movie. It as really slow.Maybe for a family that has nothing better todo.
3,Lighthearted let-down,"I came into this expecting something mindblowing and conceptually aggressive. Instead, its follows the ""mystery solving boy"" formula pretty closely. Its pretty over-the-top at times with action that bordered upon slapstick, and I had to remind myself more than once that its an adaptation of an old comic. Still, for all that, I found it to be enjoyable. It is visually impressive and the Amazon streaming treated it well."
3,Entertaining but not for my young child.,"I thought it was decent but my 3 year old wasn't into it, which meant I couldn't finish watching it. I will re-watch it when she's not around, not because I'm really into it but because I have to watch a whole movie when I begin to watch it."
4,The Adventures of Tintin,The Adventures of Tintin is a thoroughly enjoyable film. Why should you insist my review be a certain length? I resent that.
4,Gr8 service and product,i really like the product which i received.It was a used item but the item was really good and no sign of used.
2,TinTin is ShallowShallow,"Man your going to love the animation in this movie! I'd give it a great review if that was all that mattered to me as the movie viewer. It might even be a 4 or 5 star as a family or christian movie but looking at the the rest makes it all fall apart. The story unfolds like an old cheesy Nancy Drew mystery. Sorry guys but TinTin is ShallowShallow.P.S. if your a dog lover your gonna really love SNOW, (The pooch)."
2,"Boring, linear story",Title says it all. Events were quite guessable. I was not enthralled with the movie. Very lack luster. The only good thing was the quality of the CGI animation.
3,Why? Actually.,"I agree with several reviewers that this is not the best movie ever. If you have ever read any of the Tintin comics you will immediately feel that you've seen this before. The producer/director just animated the comics. They did a good job of the animation but you really didn't care much about the main character(s). By the end of the movie I was just tired and wondered why the movie had gone on for so long and the final ending was basically a ""meh"" with a shoulder shrug (a la Gru's mom in Dispicable Me).I honestly wondered why they even made a movie out of a little known Belgian comic book about a character who is a journalist who is somwhere between 12 and 20 years old. If so, why isn't he in school and how is he a journalist and where does he get his money?"
1,Poorly done,This was poor animation with caricature characters and the misleading title. Tintin is the guy not the dog and this is not about a dog. The dog has a very small role.
2,"Great animation, boring movie","I was amazed by the animation. However, early on, I found some of the characters and/or their actions annoying. Astoundingly, the action sequences are boring -- not exciting -- with too much happening for no particular point. I never felt involved in the story or really cared. Tintin has promise as a character as well as Snowy, the dog. I ran the second half of the movie at 1.5x speed and felt even at that that the movie was too long for what it contained. A thin -- though visually stunning -- gruel, indeed. There's a kernel of a movie in there somewhere. Too bad two of the most famous directors in the world couldn't find it."
4,Fantastic animation! Juvenille story.,"This movie was visually stunning. I don't think I've seen anything as impressive yet. The plot was simple enough for kids to follow along, however I wouldn't recommend it to kids younger than maybe 8."
4,worth watching,"this is classic Tintin and certainly worth watching especially since it's free with Prime. It's a cartoon but it's an adult movie with crime fighting, alcohol, guns, etc."
4,The Adventures of Tintin,Cute Movie. Sort of a cross between Sherlock Holmes and Get Smart rolled up in animation. Suited for young adults.
2,Poor video quality,The movie was great but was very disappointed in the video quality. The picture was not clear and had several blippy interruptions.
2,zzzzzz,Spielberg has gone the way of M night this movie was booooring. Silly animation. There was not enough character or story development to really get into this movie JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
2,Lacks 3D experience,"Disappointed with 3D, unlike Hugo the image was flat. The only scene that I felt achieved the experience was the flying scene."
1,Really????!!!,Two of the greatest directors get together to make a film and this is what they choose?? WTF!! So many great books and stories and they make this crap? WHY? Most people didn't even know who or what the hell TinTin was!. Such a load of garbage.
1,Deception,"Shame on you, Spielberg and Jackson ... but no, you're not really guilty, because you can't do better, but shame on you, Moffat, whose 'Coupling' we used to love and appreciate so much ...I'd like to cry like Augustus .... Spielberg, Jackson and Moffat! Give me back my legions ... eh ... my real Tintinstory!!!And even if you deliver the best images, the best graphics and the best ridiculous action scenes á la Indiana Jones ... in the end it's like eating crap from golden dishes ... it remains crap.I am so disappointed ...."
4,Good Movie,"I love the animation in the film, but Amazon Prime stops frequently requiring me to restart the app. and resume play. Frustrating."
3,Great animation,"The animation is so well done and it really is fun to watch, so I almost gave it a 4. But it seemed a bit too long to me, and I was more than ready for it to end. I'm not sure who the right audience is for a movie like this."
1,ONE OF THE WORST SOUNDING CD'S I'VE EVER HEARD!,"This supposedly remastered CD sounds bright & thin with no body or bass. It's so awful that I had to take it off my stereo within seconds of playing it. I even tried to improve the sound by using a treatment available on the market to improve the sound, but that didn't even work since this CD sounds so bad. Releasing this terrible sounding CD is a disgrace. The A&M label should be ashamed of themselves!"
5,Brazil!,The record that started the career of Sergio Mendes and lead to the discovery of Brazilian music and then other geniuses such as Carlos Santana
3,Good for what it is,"I own a Fobus for my smaller KelTec p32 and it works great and is concealable considering the gun is so small. I thought I would have the same luck with this one for my SigPro 2022 but unfortunately it just doesn't work. The holster puts the weapon far off of the body and it is completely noticeable. Aside from that the holster seems to be good, it looks as if it would cause a lot of wear if it was used on a steady basis."
5,the secret garden (hallmark hall of fame),i LOVE this movie! i watch this one several times a year too. i would LOVE to have this on my KINDLE FIRE-as i am trying to get all my favorites on it. so i would have all the i get the warm and fuzzies with . :)
3,It Was Pretty Good,"I think the '93 version is much better, but I still think that this one is still worth your time watching. Some of the acting wasn't all that great and the music was pretty generic. But I think at the time this film was created, I think it left an impact on alot of people. Whether it was good or bad."
5,Secret Garden,I first heard this story when I was in grade school. It was wonderful then and almost 40 yrs. later it is still a wonderful story.
2,"Great story, not a good video","The Secret Garden is one of my favorite children's stories. This video keeps faithfully to the story, but is ruined for me by the fact that the three children (Mary, Colin, and Dicken) all have American accents and Martha has a Cockney accent. Maybe this wouldn't matter to someone who doesn't know English accents at all, but Dicken and Martha should have the same broad Yorkshire accents (they're brother and sister after all!) and Mary should have an upperclass British accent. These details are important to the story.My 6 year old found elements of the video quite scary but stayed glued to it nonetheless."
2,Dissapointed,"I watched this movie in Religion and was dissapointed that it didn't follow the book. I read the book as a child and saw almost every version of the movie available, but now seeing this one again (I'm pretty sure I saw this before) I was annoyed at how much it changed the book. I think if your going to take a book and make it a movie you have no right to take such liberties. The way Mary discovers the garden and the key are absolutely rediculous. Also I don't like colin's strange fortune-teller like air. I had no emotional reaction to the ending where the children are all grown up because they just seemed like random actors and didn't even remotely resemble the children. Don't get this version if your a purist."
1,Watch the 1993 version instead...,"These Hallmark films bore me to tears. They are far from exciting, let alone interesting. Nothing more than a long talk-a-thon with very little going on. The music is not so great either. Watch the 1993 version instead. It's the best one. You can find it here:The Secret Garden"
4,Not for English Learners,"This movie is wonderfully acted however there are no subtitles. The themes may be a little scary for young children, I saw it as a child and had a vivid nightmare about the plague at the beginning."
4,COOL!! lol,"This item i bought was CLASS!! lolI am an avid and keen collector of comic books and have bin for many many years now and when i saw this on the net i jumped to the chance to get it!!It was well packed and everythin, and in very good condition, however the postage was canny pricy i must say; BUT getting the item was well worth it like.I was pleased with this item :)"
5,very good anime,"I have just completed watching this series and I will say that it was most defintely better than others that I have watched. I usually watch more girly animes not to much fantasy but after buying the book I was hooked and the dvds were also very addictive. It's very nicely played out, the characters have there funny moments and than the serious ones. It's not cheesy either where you have to roll your eyes. It was done well and ended on a good note. I am going to buy season two though from the looks of other reviews it was not as great or up to par but what can we expect most things that are continued such as dragonball gt are never as good as the original."
5,"A fine ""Gianni"" with lots lof life","The Preiser reissue of the classic Cetra recording of ""Gianni Schicchi"" catches all the brio of Puccini's raucous comedy while perhaps sacrificing some of the subtle beauties of the score. The sound is very good, clear mono.Giuseppe Taddei is a capital Schicchi - a pro at both serious and comic elements of the score. Grete Rapisardi's Lauretta is slightly underpowered and at one point in ""O mio babbino caro"" threatens to be engulfed by the orchestra but she imbues her one big scene with pathos so that it becomes part of the scene - not a soprano showcase. Giuseppe Savio is a rather brash Rinuccio but he brings life to the part. The other relatives and witnesses are full of personality and give this 1949 radio broadcast all the feeling of a live stage performance.Glad to have this performance available!!"
5,A Charmer...,"I am a Fan (yes, with a capital ""F"") of Scott. His lyrics are honest and from the heart, something that I can say of the man himself. It's low key, sometimes sad, sometimes uplifting, but always always interesting. One of the few performers that I will buy anything unheard, pop it onto my iPod, and know that I'm in for a gem of a song."
2,Disappointed,"This is my first time writing a review. I thought I would give my 2 cents. I ordered the VHS tape and the movie left much to be desired. The acting was horrible. I expected more from Sam Jackson and Rashad, who played Eliza. It reminded me of a play where everyone is waiting for their cue to speak. If you've never read the book, you might find it interesting. Unfortunatley, I regret purchasing it."
4,Stone chillin' dub,"Every song is very tight, very expressive and an excellent representative of roots/dub and the genius of producers King Tubby and Bunny Lee and the musicianship of the Aggrovators'. The selection of artists is excellent. Definitely one of the better reggae compilations available."
2,Very misleading,"This book is not about her life with Timothy McVeigh because she didn't have a life with Tim McVeigh. She hardly knew him and her contact with him was limited to a few brief phone calls and one short in person meeting when Tim came to her house to pick up a tv set.I feel the title was very deceptive and designed to lure people in. She had a life with Terry yes, but not Tim. Plus she made the unfair allegation that Tim killed Marife Nichol's son when there is not and was not the thinnest shred of evidence thats true.In fact all the evidence points in the opposite direction-that McVeigh tried to save the boys life.Only read if you have an intense desire to know every last scrap of information, mainly about Terry Nichols because he is primarily what the book is about."
5,Sco' rocked with Miles and he's one of the best...,"This music is like the cyberpunk novels of William Gibson: Well-crafted, dazzling, befuddling, and just plain creative. Some understated playing, some furious solos that flare up out of nowhere, a panacea of well chosen electronica and effects to cure what ails ya. A heady mixture of cerebral and nasty with endlessly intriguing structures. I'm not quite sure what it is, but I like it. P.S. I heartily agree with the reviewer who said you can't judge this after one listen, or even a handful. This isn't the Backstreet Boys people...."
3,Pretty Solid,"I'd never heard of John Scofield until I saw Uberjam on someones list. I checked it out and thought it was pretty sweet. I got it for christmas and put it in. It's a good cd. The jams can be pretty uber. It lives up to its name mostly. However it doesnt quite do it for me. Sometime I find it really funky and other times it's just nice background music. On a few tracks Medeski is an excellent addition to their sound. Normally I'd give this 4 stars but on ""I brake 4 Monster Booty"" someone starts rapping which just makes me go ... Just because they put that in I have to give it 3 stars. Other than that this is an awesome CD."
2,fighting for space,"This album doesn't quite make it for me... it has lots of interesting sounds and rhythms, but the music doesn't end proposing ideas i think. It is a long jam as the album says.. but just lick after lick and drum fill after drum fill.. i don't know, for me it's still not an 'album'. You have to really struggle to tell one piece from the other.. and the guitar improvising is all over 1 or 2 chord progressions..I love Scofields playing and just don't feel this is one of his better works."
1,Scofield? More like BlowField,"I am a big sco fan. Maybe one of the biggest. Ever. My name is Steve Ascher from NYC. Once I bumped into the sco-daddy in starbucks in NYC. this cd is kinda sketch. sco is starting to get a little too far out there. with titles like ""acidhead"" and ""uberjam"", are you kidding me? sco go back to the land of A-Go-Go and Bump. Me and Seibs might even be more on time than the special guests on this album."
2,"Not so good, and I generally like anything with Vampires","Cheap, campy, poor acting, poor plot. There are so many good vampire movies out there. This is not one of them."
5,A bitingly funny Vampire satire,"I didn't know what to expect when popping this in, but wow. Mewes is a reveleation, and Nic Nac ***shakes his head*** amazing."
3,Grown-ups don't Budget,"I was a little disappointed after reading the 'Unofficial Guides to Disney' for years--going back about 12 years. I didn't realize it was by a different author. It doesn't include some of the less expensive options, hotels for example. It does have good info but it seems to assume grown-ups have a lot to spend and aren't as budget conscious as families. I wouldn't buy new editions of this as I would the original guide."
2,Great content marred by awful software,"It's too bad that the interface is so clunky (other reviewers have already pointed out the problems, so I won't bother here). This is at least the sixth edition of Britannica on CD/DVD, and there's no excuse for such poor software. A shame, really, because the text is far better than anything else out there. I'd like to see them work with Microsoft and develop an interface similar to Encarta's. They could call it Encarta Pro, with the same interface as Encarta but with the authoritative text of Britannica. If only."
4,A little blury,"I like this poster flag, but the image is a little blury, not sure if it was meant to be this way, but still looks good."
1,Read the other reviews- this rug falls apart.,"I wish I would have trusted the other reviews. Within the first 3 months the rugs (we bought two) started falling apart. We washed the rugs per the instructions, but they still started shedding and leaving chunks of fabric all over the house.Only buy this if you want to use it for looks and throw it away before you have to wash it-seriously."
2,Looked pretty for a few days,"This rug sheds a LOT! and it looked full and fluffy for only a few days and started to lay flat since then! even when it's dry. And with that amount of shedding, I'm afraid to wash it and not ruining the rug!"
1,"Useless, even when it was first released.","I bought this thing when it was first released in 1999. Even for the time, the technology was substandard and the operating system was primitive. It's pretty much a useless gadget that doesn't even look cool by today's standards. Honestly, my first generation Palm Pilot was more useful than this thing."
4,A good read.,"I highly recommend this book for scince fiction fans and ufo buffs alike. The reason the ufos are here is finnally revieled as the begin to attack passenger jets,nuclear power plants and military targets.The big nations of the world unite to build a gaint graser a laser that is the only thing that can stop the aliens."
4,Invader Review,"Invader is a good story based on conventional hard science of the late 70s and early 80s. It is a rare book for that era in that the characterization of the Soviet Union is neither harsh, nor uncharacteristically optimistic. It is what might actually have occurred under the circumstances.The disappointing part was the ending. I think the authors left a lot of things undone that would have required either a sequel or a different ending to follow up the main book. In many ways it reminded me of a hostile version of Rendevouz with Rama by Arthur C. Clark.Would love to see as a Kindle book."
4,Great epic sci-fi tale,This was a classic David and Goliath story about alien invasion from a slightly different perspective; an almost ninja-like infiltration to soften up the opponent (humanity) before the massive invasion blow. The initial struggle for the Earth occurs in skirmishes all over the planet culminating in a battle over the one weapon humanity has to defend itself from annihilation.
5,Overpowering in its excellence,"""Not made by Hands"" is a remarkable text, if for no other reason how convincing it is in its claims for which science is the demonstrator. I cannot recommend this work highly enough to anyone who has an interest in facts and data, not the old tired claptrap which continuously loses to battles where evidence is the arbiter. Brother Thomas Sennott has accomplished a great, great deal in so few pages to show the miraclous nature of the Guadalupe tilma. His comments on the Shroud go equally far. If you ever want to read a book that is precise, simple, accurate, and easy to understand about miracles and man's nonparticipation in them (for they are the word of the Divine), read this. You will be thinking on what Brother Thomas Sennott has written for quite some time."
2,hard to get going,I found the book a little dull but persevered until the end. It's easy reading but a little clumsily written.
3,"""High-Return, Low-Risk Investment""","With better editing this book could have been a classic. The authors perform a valuable service in disposing of some common illusions regarding the stock market, but the reading experience is marred by frequent defects in the English."
4,History or fiction?,"This is a novel with a strong historical undercurrent. Situated mostly in Newfoundland during the Second World War, this novel takes some historical facts, particularly the death of Nobel Prize winner Sir Frederick Banting, co-discoverer of insulin, in a plane crash on his way to England to pressure the UK government to develop biologoical weapons, and constructs a story wherein Banting is assassinated by the Nazis."
5,Simply Wonderful,"I have bought this book for many friends children, I'm looking to buy another copy and have found that it's out of print. I can't believe it; I never got a copy for myself. This is a must have book."
1,This is the worst dvd/vcr product that you could buy!,"I first bought this last week, and when I played DVD's it made a loud humming/buzzing sound. It was so loud that you could barely hear the audio. I returned it, and decided to try another one just in case I had gotten a defective one previously. Well, when I set up the next one it did the same exact thing. I don't recommend anyone buy this product! It is by far a terrible machine, so avoid it if you can!!"
1,What a Piece of Crap,"I bought this in July and used it to watch a few exercise videos on VHS. On Thanksgiving, we tried to watch a DVD for the first time. The tray was stuck closed and made horrible grinding noises. We finally got it open but it's not lined up and it won't close. It just makes grinding noises. Guess I should have tried to use it sooner. Now the ""return an item"" option doesn't show up on Amazon. Guess I'll have to deal with Toshiba directly now. I would love to return it though."
1,Confusing and terrible.,I first bought this machine because it was a Toshiba. It took my family 2 hours just to find out how to play the VCR and DVD. The remote is very complicated and confusing. There are many steps just and learning how to record a show on TV. It makes a lot of noise when it plays a video. The time is missing the second time. When you select SP or SLP its only showed on the screen for a very short time. You have to push the botton again and only know if it is SP or SLP. I would not recommand this model to anyone unless they have the time to read the manual for a whole week to fully understand this machine. Even if you did read it some of the functions would still not work properly. This machine is like a temparay test product.
3,Cassette ejection problem,"I received this unit as a Christmas gift 2004 and have had no problem with the DVD door. However, twice a cassette has become stuck in the VCR. The first time I was able to get it out, but this time no luck. I tried unplugging the unit and trying the eject button again without success. Next step to call Toshiba for assistance, if no help no more Toshiba products"
2,Frame not covered under warrenty,"I really do like these glasses. However be very careful with them. I owned them less than a year, and wore them occasionally. When one day I went to put them on and the frame just snapped in my hand. Maui Jim said the warrenty didn't cover it. At least for another $55 I was able to get them fixed. So just be careful putting them on."
3,Just wasn't my style.,"This book didn't quite grab me the way it seems to have grabbed other reviewers. I can appreciate it, reading about her life and historical aspects of quilting were interesting, but it just wasn't my style. For me, having a visual reference would have helped. I would have loved for her to have added photos of the quilts she was making and writing about and/or photos of the historical figures and quilts she wrote about."
3,awsome special effects,"the special effects artist did an AWSOME JOB, but the over all movie lacks something?"
3,The bags are a waste,"I just bought this kit and I can tell you it's kinda stupid. You would think the small camera case with the accessories would fit into the larger bag. Not easily, if at all. So you get to haul 2 bags around for these small cameras,cord,charger and battery.The small case is nice,though."
5,Go Vaccum,First time I've used GoVacuum. I'd definitely come back to purchase again from them! Competitively priced and quick delivery.
3,Campy Count Classics!,"Disc One is great...the chilling Lugosi classic, a documentary, commentary tracks...beautifully packaged bonus features for horror buffs.Disc Two, however...a real disappointment. Full of glitches which made the viewing experience maddening. Hopefully your copy won't be similarly damaged.What's all the fuss about the Spanish version? Give me Dwight and Bela ANY day!The Universal sequels aren't much fun, either. DRACULA's DAUGHTER is dreck! Illogical yawner. SON OF DRACULA and HOUSE OF DRACULA, while neither could be called spooky in the least, still manage to capture the nostalgic feel of Saturday matinees. Lon Chaney and John Carradine are both laughable casting choices, but the flying bats...misty marshes...and hunchbacked assistants make for fun viewing."
5,The Greatest Video I've EVER SEEN.,"But then, I'm three years old. Your kids will love it. A few decent larfs for the adults, too."
1,Bad Design flaw,Do not buy this camera. The images were never very good even with the IR filter.I was using it vertically on a tripod and the baseplate broke off. I was using a 90 mm lens but that was the only thing on it. I researched it on-line and found several people that had the EXACT same problem. For some reason leica repaired some of them under warranty. They told me that I must have misused it for it to break off exactly like several other people's had broken off and wanted to charge $1000 or so to repair their bad design. I will never purchase another leica since they seem to have let quality go out the door.
2,Excellent Production for the Blind!,"The best I can say is that if you are an aspiring director, set designer, or choreographer, this production will make you feel like ""You Can Do It!"" even if you have little experience and lack vision. So there is something positive to say: that anyone can land a gig designing for the opera in major European markets.It's even better if you're just blind or have vision so poor that the stage is just a blur. The orchestra sounds nice; bright, balanced, fluid, and the singers know how to pull off the baroque.But one more comment about the stage. It's like parents day on the Death Star (The Return of the Jedi one) and the Emperor's Guards have gotten together their moms and dads who share a passion for late Guns and Roses and have adapted Axl's stringy corn rows.Yeah it's a shame because Rameau's score is fantastic!"
5,A Christmas masterpiece for the whole family!,"It was a tradition to watch this special on HBO every year. The comedy is absolutely hilarious. Rich Little's impersonations are wonderful and will immediately fill your heart with the Christmas spirit. When this movie is re-released, if ever, I would truely recommend this classic for your holiday collection. Believe me, it will soon be a tradition in your home."
4,Scarecrow,"I am a huge fan of Matthew Reilly's. This book is by far the BEST of the Scarecrow series. I really liked the premise of the bounty hunters and the Scarecrow's 'protector' Knight is easilly a close tie for one of my favorite characters. I look forward to a series of his own.For anyone looking for a very fast, thrill a second ride, check out Scarecrow...you will not be sorry!"
3,Superbly implausible.,"Impossible describes this book quite nicely, but if you're willing to pretend that Scholfield has the power to slow down time and has esp, then, you can believe it. The first few pages got me into the book, but as I read on, I realized that things were a little too far-fetched. When I think a book is too over the top, who knows what other's think? Nevertheless, it keeps you in the story and has cool characters, so that's 3 stars. The book is peppered with cliff-hangers like ""The plane crashed in the sea and exploded with enough force to kill anyone in it."" Then on the next page it says ""It did explode, but Scarecrow wasn't in it. He had leaped out and was now parachuting to the ground while peppering the hapless bounty hunters with his trusty M-5."" Not great realism here. Just pretend Shane Scholfield is Neo from the matrix, and you're in for a sweet ride."
1,Not so good...,"First of all let me say that I'm a big fan of Matthew Reilly. I've all his books with the exception of the hover car series and enjoyed nearly every one of them. Scarecrow I did not however; it was an absolute battle for me to even finish this book. I'm sure you'd know to expect action in a Matthew Reilly story, but this was far too over the top and I found it almost exhausting to read. It's action action action with no break, the story leads from one thing to another and back again over and over. Characters get into impossible situations where you think they've had it, when suddenly, [surprise] another impossible factor gets them out. The first couple of times the fact a character may die seems plausible to you, but you just expect some more crap to save them time after time -- it becomes very predictable and boring, really. It's painful! Read Ice Station and leave it there I'd say!"
2,Scaredy-crow,"I only read this because it was my book club's selection. That said, the action swept me along...and my morbid desire to know what awful ends various characters would meet."
1,Completely absurd,"I enjoy many books, I allow for Artistic license, and I do not require absolute accuracy or impeccible physics, but this book went too far. The plot is absurd, but I can forgive that.The cast of charachters keeps coming back to life even when faced with certain death numerous times. As readers, we are asked to believe that scores of highly trained Special Forces Commandos of numerous countries using extremely high tech weapons can't seem to hit anyone or do any significant damage, even when they have superior odds, superior firepower, and superior training on their side. The author seems adept at ( almost ) killing people off using unescapable situations only to have them reappear later after having escaped certain death using comic book type rationale. After a few ( of many )of these silly situations it was a chore to finish this book. It is not believeable, it is not rational, it is not reasonable, it's explanations border on magic. Save your money."
5,Action Packed Book!,"The central character in this book,Marine Captain Shane Schofield and 14 other targets are targeted for assassination.There is a bounty of 18.5 million on each of their heads.Thetargets include commandos,spies and terrorists.The bounties havebeen levied by a council of billionaires known as Majestic12.Their targets are capable of stopping their plans to detonatenuclear devices and profit from arms sales.There is a group ofprofessional bounty hunters who are out to collect the bounties.You have bounty hunters from all over the world.Another bountyhunter,the Black Knight is hired to protect Shane Schofield(theScarecrow).The great bounty hunt takes place all over the world.This is a page turner of a book that has action from start tofinish.I certainly enjoyed it."
1,Violent and Depressing,"In this gritty crime novel, author Doris Roberts tries to conjour the ghosts of the pulp greats of the past. Unfortunately her characters are wooden cliches and the action turns gruesomely violent quickly. Roberts attempts at stylish atmospheric flourishes are, frankly, laughable, and the whole thing smacks of the amateurishish ramblings of a freshman creative writing student. A for effort, D- for result."
5,Great product,"This is my second pair of these gloves. As i bought the first pair >10 years ago i was worried that the design may have changed, but thankfully they have not, and they work as well as I remember. Great price for a very durable product."
1,send a wrong product many times,"A wrong product has been sent.The product which I proposed an objection, and had been sent with apology by the Amazons again was wrong again."
4,An excellent choice,"I have been using these gloves for five years;Make sure you see that it was one pair of these gloves.I've been looking around at alternatives, since my leatheris basically skin-thin, and it seems that this is stillwhat is needed. I'm still looking and thinking,but this has been a good choice, well worth the moneyand meeting everything I hoped it would....for five years."
4,great gloves for working out,These are better than the gloves without the wristwraps...they aren't as loose and the wristwraps add extra support when I am lifting. The only thing that would make this better is if there was more padding on the palm area.
2,not durable at all!!,I've used this gloves for about one week and they are already getting pretty messed up.
3,"Okay, not the best","These gloves fit snuggly but were hard to ""break in."" They seemed extra tight for the first week. They also left black marks on my palms. They seem to be okay now but definitely won't buy this product again."
4,Best Glove I have found,"With the wrist support and snug, secure fit, these are very supportive gloves. I don't typically like gloves too much when working out, so I haven't used mine in some time, but that's a personal preference. The only bad thing I found was they are rather difficult to get off, so unless you're going to wear them for every exercise in your regimen, they're a pain in the rear. They certainly do what they are designed to do while they are on your hands though."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","The ""wrist wrap"" part of this glove is pretty bad. It doesn't wrap tightly around my wrist. If I wanted the wrist wrap part tight, then the velcro part would go around my thumb."
4,Classic stories by a classic author/poet,"This was a two volume set of selected works. I have the second volume only, but it's great. It has ""The Devil and Daniel Webster"", ""A Tooth for Paul Revere,"" and one I didn't know Benet wrote--""The King of the Cats!"" 23 stories. 483 pages. This one is great reading before bed. Good short stories."
3,not bad-but not TERRY at his best!!,"Gee, it's a real shame to have to say this , but , i will. I've been a Reid fan ever since i bought ""River"", on good old-fashioned vinyl in the early 70's ....""sEED OF mEMORY"" is undisputedly , a mega-classic!!!Read the reviews here & decided to buy it...i feel somehow let down ..it's like a Peter Frampton album ..o.k. , but not the Greaaat Terry Reid i know & truly love!!!..Hong Kong being the only track that really hit me!!Come on , Terry, let us have a studio album like ""River""/""Seed of "" again!!!!!Looking forward to seeing him LIVE, in Manchester this Nov.!!!!!!!!!!Quite a good album, but certainly NOT great!!"
3,Buster Brown's Very Best,"Good collection. Buster Brown's famous riff on ""Fannie Mae"" is repeated in many of the other songs. It's a case of going with what works for you.I was surprised by Buster's take on ""John Henry"". With better production values and timing, this could have been a hit, and even though the lyrics are pretty muddy, it is an obvious departure from the traditional takes on this old favorite. Worth the money and pretty much sums up Buster's career."
3,Its just ok....,all it is for the most part is aloe vera... didn't live up too my expectations. Cremo cream in my opinion is way better.
3,okay,not as organized as the princeton review version- but it is better for actually study questions on each period.
2,Same old same old,"The author wanted to keep making money and changed a sentence here and there to have people keep buying new books. What they should do is rewrite the stale and stupid(too easy) multiple choice questions and place all the answers on the back so kids can take the test without cheating. In addtion, the maps should be large and should contain more pertinent information that is easier to read. Foldout maps would be ideal. this company has been my sole book for four years. if they continue to produce the same old book with minor modifications so we have to buy new ones, i will stop using it."
4,"Good Review, Okay Essays, Weird Time Periods","I used this book to study for my AP World History test, and I got a 5! My grades weren't that great during the year, and the five really surprised me, but I think the reason I got a five was this book. It has really good review of everything and good tips for the test in the beginning. The practice tests are pretty good, too. I only have two problems with it. First, the practice essay questions are good but the example essays are really bad (not enough information in them). Second, the first two time periods in this book don't correspond to the first two time periods the AP test actually uses. They're off by about 400 years. That irritated me when I was trying to review certain time periods.Anyways, it is a good book and I definitely recommend it. I looked through the other two major ones (Princeton Review and Kaplan) and this one definitely seemed superior. Buy it!"
4,"Essentially superb, but has flaws...","This test-prep book was paramount in my scoring a `5' on the AP World History examination; however, it does have its flaws. Firstly, it is an immense book, and it will do you absolutely no good trying to read it all the night before the AP exam. There also exists a lot of information I thought was useless, so I highlighted concepts that I thought were most important. Basically, this book was the sole reason I scored a 5. I had an abysmal WH teacher (yea, you Ms. S---e M----n!) who taught us absolutely nothing, so I was screwed until my other AP prep teacher (thanks Mr. R!!!) found this book for our class. The multiple choice questions in the book are at par with the AP exam questions, and the essay we had to write this May for the exam was actually one of the practice essays (w/the answer) found in the beginning of the book."
1,Waste of Money,This book is nothing more than copied black and white photos from a magazine. Reviews written from England. This is a waste of your hard earned money unless you like black and white copied photos that look very bad. I think that Kinko's would have done a better job of preparing this book.
5,Just as good as the original!,"I loved this book! Poppy has to travel to Ragweed's family's home to inform them of his death but when she gets theur she discovers a conflict between the mouses and the bevers that could run Ragweed's family out of their treasured home. She also finds a mouse named Rye, who looks much like Ragweed himself and she finds herself falling for Rye... the same way she loved Ragweed.If you liked the original you'll love the sequel. It has just as much excitement as the first!"
1,Scientific Whitewash.,"Certainly it's possible to hallucinate or imagine one was abducted by ""aliens,"" or to have false memories of such encounters. But, that's like dismissing all UFO sightings as a bird, plane, swamp gas or the planet Venus. I refer the reader to an outstanding book review by well-known physicist, author and UFO researcher Stanton Friedman. His review of ABDUCTED is posted on his website (which isn't hard to find.) He blows a whole so big in Dr. Clancy's conclusion that it leaves her book in shreds. Clancy's book is another example of a scientist who doesn't explain the Big Picture. Unfortunately, regarding aliens/EBEs, scientists are among the last to know what's going on. To balance Dr. Clancy's book, you are encouraged to read ""ABDUCTION: HUMAN ENCOUNTERS WITH ALIENS"" by John E. Mack, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School's Cambridge Hospital. (See Editorial Reviews of this book here at Amazon.com) This book is pretty good :-)"
2,Whatever one starts out to prove will be the result.,"To the Harvard psychologists, it was obvious that their subjects had suffered an episode of sleep paralysis - a state of limbo between sleep and being awake, sometimes punctuated by hallucinations.(Don't they love to throw that word HARVARD around?)Ok my parents & I were interupted and abducted while eating supper. Go figure.When someone from Harvard University, and most especially a psychology researcher writes a book, you can be 95% sure they will cling to the standards that will keep them in good standing with their colleagues, no earth shaking news here huh?Susan A. Clancy says; ""It's very human for us to believe in things for which there is no scientific evidence.""This is book is a waste of time and money, cause once a shrink learns all the perimeters to human thought then that's all everything can be attributed to, just figments of our imagination.Don."
5,Another great remix of O' fortuna,"1.O'fortuna 6.33, 2. Storm 4.45, 3. Overtop 5.30 4. nature shake3.30 5.MC Jump mix 6.33 6. extended mix 6.49Its a great CD and I've collect almost 30 remix versions.Look for Excalibur by Nick Skitz or F.C.B., and The Omen for O'fortuna mix."
1,Mis-Representation,"The company sent a substitute without my permission,& now they will not refund the price.I wanted the ""Original"" BC Powder, which the picture showed,because the NEW BC has double the caffeine & the aspirin,which is not good for me. They should have sent an e-mail sayingthat they could not fulfill my order, & asked permission tomake a substitution, which I would not have agreed to. A MEDICALSUBSTITUION CAN BE CRITICAL! At the very least, when I requesteda refund (& gave them the reason), they should have honored it.That's bad business & loss of a customer."
3,ok read,I thought the book was an ok read. It had its moments where it was kinda boring. Definitely not one of her best books. It was just ok for me.
4,Not a dog,This is yet another example of the musicianship of this fantastic artist. He weaves some great lyrics and music together to generate some very good tracks including the title track Honeysuckle Dog and Tribute to Mississippi John Hurt. He also performs some other tracks by other writers including Randy Newman that they could only feel good about. Good album and well worth a listen.
2,What the Heck?,"I am really getting miffed. I LOVE this show. It is exactly why I keep buying up these DVDs. I am basically wanting to collect every episode of these great series on DVD.BUT, the repeat of the episode ""Christmas with the Joker"" really has me miffed. There are only a limited amount of these episodes on DVD and they are repeating episodes?I am really frustrated because I want these episodes on DVD, but I truly am wasting my money on these [...] products Warner Bros. is producing. Why is every other television series released in the correct manner?"
3,Ok,I needed this book for a class. A lot of the information is what you would find from a psychology class combined with some educational research.
2,Get what you pay for with this toothpaste,This toothpaste is ok but doesn't get my dog's teeth as shiny and white as the CET toothpaste I normally get. I thought I would try this one since it cost less. I also would have preferred to have 2 toothbrushes instead of the finger brush. The finger brush is so soft as to be useless. I have a 2 year old Chow-Newfoundland. I brush his teeth every night and after a week there was nothing left of the finger brush! I would rather spend a little more and get the CET toothpaste from another vendor that also has free shipping. Don't buy CET via Amazon's 3rd party sellers or you will have to pay for shipping.
5,Perfect for my dogs,"I can finally brush my dog's teeth without them squirming around too much. They like this toothpaste and the small brush side is perfect for my small dogs. Finally, my dogs can have clean teeth!"
5,doggy dentist,This product is great for the price. Toothpaste is yummy and can even be put on food to enhance. Brush is 2 sided so adapts to size of pet and even comes with a finger brush which fits my finger fine. (I have small hands)
5,Frankenstein: The Legacy Collection......It's ALIVE!!!!!,"Frankenstein: The Legacy Collection is a must have for anyone who loves the Frankenstein films. The collection has 5 films, Frankenstein, The Bride of Frankenstein, Son of Frankenstein, Ghost of Frankenstein, and The House of Frankenstein, the set has 2 DVDs, both loaded with extras, and all the films play very good in DVD player.It would take me hours to tell you about all 5 Frankenstein films, so I'll just say that if you're a big fan of the Frankenstein films, this collection is for you. I enjoy them all every time I watch them. Give Frankenstein: The Legacy Collection a try, you won't be disappointed. I enjoyed them all."
5,Frankenstein legacy collection,"I received this DVD within six days. I played it Halloween night for friends. It is a great collection of the Frankenstein movies from my childhood. I plan on buying the others Dracula, Wolf Man, Invisible Man legacy DVD's."
4,Excellent collection,"This is a collection of every ""Frankenstein"" film made by Universal studios in the 1930s. The set must be judged by the quality of the first two films in the collection: 1931's ""Frankenstein"" and 1935's ""Bride of Frankenstein."" Both films are in fairly pristine condition, although ""Frankenstein"" seems to be less vivid and clean than the 1999 VHS transfer. Only minimal restoration seems to have been done to the other three films in this collection. Overall, the image and sound qualities are very high. This 2004 release lacks about half the extras found on the 2006 ""75th Anniversary"" release, and one wonders why Universal did this version. (Obviously, to build off interest on it's 2004 film ""Van Helsing,"" a true stinker of a movie.)My biggest complaint: You have to turn Disc 1 over to get the the fifth film, ""Ghost of Frankenstein,"" to play. BAD planning!"
5,Wonderful,I had some problem with the Dracula collection. But the Frankenstein collection is spot on. I couldn't have asked for a better copy. I'm very happy with it.
2,You'll need to either get lucky or keep on returning copies,"It's really great to have these films together in what is (visually, anyhow) a very handsome package. On the other hand, as others have complained before me, the reality of the packaging is that the disks break from their cheap clear plastic holding tabs, get scratched, and become unplayable. I've had to return two copies of the FRANKENSTEIN and three of DRACULA before I found acceptable copies.The films themselves are fine and look great, but when the disk freezes or simply refuses to play a film, we're talking significant problems.I also cringe at the advertising aspect of these films (does the director of Van Helsing have anything to tell us about FRANKENSTEIN? Does he even belong on the same disk as horror film historian, David Skal. Nope on both counts.To my mind, these films should be repackaged and customers offered a free upgrade. This is inexcusable hack packaging from a major studio's whose past work has been stellar."
2,Classic DVD,"Recieved fast, but had to return 3 times. The DVD was loose inside the case and scratched when received. But returns were easy and didn't have to pay postage as manufacturer was responsible."
2,Charming rehash,"I think I own all of Ms. Stoddard's previous books. I have kept, enjoyed and reread most of them. I must say I am disappointed in this effort. If you have never read her books, then by all means buy this one and you will enjoy it. If you have read her priors, there is nothing new here for you. I'm amazed that she can repackage the same messages so many different ways. According to her website, she has two more books in the works. I assume more of the same.Who would polish their brass on vacation anyway?"
1,"Ms. Stoddard, YOU MUST BE KIDDING!","I find it hard to believe that those of us who live normal, 9 to 5 lives, could ever live up to Ms. Stoddard's expectations. Some of her suggestions are just plain ridiculous for those of us who are on a limited budget. It is plainly obvious, not only with this book, but some of Ms. Stoddard's other books, that she and her husband Peter spare no expense with their lavish life-style. Two homes, trips to Paris, beautiful clothing, yadda, yadda, yadda. I guess they are happy!!!! She needs to come down to earth and realize there are people out there who can not afford Porthault lines, or Roger Muhl paintings. I guess she wouldn't be caught dead sleeping on linens from that fabulous French store ""JC Pen-NAY"". Does she have any suggestions for those of us who struggle to make ends meet and keep our heads above water? I think I will send her a quarter, so she can go buy a clue! Thank heavens this book is returnable because it goes back today."
2,closed captioning does not work work when playing DVD,My SD-V391 was a gift that sat around until my daughter wanted to use it. She called and said Closed Captioning doesn't work when playing a DVD. I played the DVD on my home theater and it worked fine. I did all the troubleshooting that Toshiba told me but no CC. They claimed that if it worked while playing a tape then it should work with a DVD. I see the Model was replaced with the SD-V392 so I suspect they knew about the problem and discontinued selling the SD-V391.
4,Not bad,"I have had this model for about a 9 months.The VCR makes better than expected recordings. I don't use this much but have no complaints.DVD functionality is flawless from my experience.The Remote blows though. There is not thing that I can't do with it, but the layout is awful and non-intuitive.I do wish that the unit could display the elapsed time counter on the unit with out also displaying it on the screen. My old JVC did this but this one forces the display to both, or neither.If not for the remote and the display, this would get 5 stars."
1,Poor quality,"Similar to another reviewer, the VCR worked well but the DVD drawer did not open. I called Toshiba and they sent a replacement unit. This time the DVD worked well, but the VCR picture quality was very poor. I have now decided to return the unit for a full refund and have opted to buy DVD and VCR units separately. I had read that you sacrifice quality with a combined unit and I can attest that to be true. There are many good quality VCR's and DVD's out there at affordable prices and I now believe that is the best way to go."
2,Muffled and scratchy - Unsatisfactory,"Because this item depends on the contact microphone for sound pickup, it is not suitable for guys with beards! I made only two calls with this headset and both parties complained about the voice quality and high noise levels. I'm going shopping for a boom-style headset..."
2,Needs a better design,"I have used 2 Jawbones, as the 1st one died after 2 weeks. Amazon instantly replaced it with no hassles at all, and I was back in business in days.The Jawbone technology is truly amazing, but that's where the good news ends. I struggled with the fit, trying every supplied ear loop and ear bud, but it still can fly off when I turn my head. It also has a mind of its own, transferring calls back to my phone 1-2 calls/day. And when that happens, you cannot transfer the call back to the Jawbone without turning it off, and back on again.I am returning my Jawbone, and will try something else. But when Jawbone's designers get innovative, I will probably try it again, as the sound quality is top-notch."
5,Amazing!,"This is the 4th bluetooth headset that I have tried and by far the best. No more ""WHAT....WHAT DID YOU SAY"". The sound reduction is amazing as if you were on a land-line. I have this hooked up to my Blackberry curve and I have no problems at all.It's great that you have all the ear piece sizes too. I did try the gels that are sold, but have small ears...not good. I suggest that you play with the ear wire to find a comfortable fit. Enjoy! I do."
3,jawbone bluetooth headset,"i've been trying to get this to fit comfortably in my ear for over a week now. it still hurts no matter what i do. radio shack has discontinued the gel pads that previous reviewers had mentioned, so i don't know what to do now.the sound quality and noise shield works very, very well though!update 12/2/08:after ordering the jabra gel earpads online, i was able to get a better fit. however, the earloop just never fit securely over my ear. the last month or so, it continually falls off and drops to the floor which is a bad thing when you are driving as you are unable to search for it.this morning, the earloop snapped totally off and broke. into the trash with this jawbone. this morning, i ordered a new plantronics 510.the sound quality and total absence of background noise were perfect on this jawbone, but the fit was impossible and frustrating."
3,Great look - reasonable performance,The packaging is absolutely top class - the initial experience with this product when you open the box is awesome. I was somewhat disappointed in teh performance though. The noise cancellation feature seems to reduce the quality/volume of the audio - turn it off if the person on the other end has trouble hearing you.
2,"No fit, No use","Hi:I tried the Jawbone after reading a number of reviews.I can not stress how important the fit to your ear and head is for this to function properly.I could not make this fit. When it came loose, which was often, those I called had great trouble hearing me. With the A/C on high in the car, the wind noise added to the problems unless I covered the item.Its not for me, but may be what you are looking for if you can make it fit.I sent it back and purchased the Motorola 710, which does the job.Dave"
4,Good back scratcher.,"The back scratcher is a good length, does what it needs to do and best of all I don't have to scratch my husband's back anymore. Always a plus considering he always asks me when I'm busy doing something else."
3,Back Scratcher,The only criticism I have about this product is that it splinters since it's wood which isn't a good quality when you're trying to scratch your back.
2,scratch?,"The end that is supposed to scratch your back is not sharp enough, it's an equivalent to just taking a ruler and trying to scratch yourself with it. Doesn't necessarily fulfill the purpose"
3,Works but requires maintenance before use,The unit shipped to me did not look like the one pictured. It had masage wheels that were in the handle and not on the outside as pictured. The unit is splintery and need sanding before use. Would be a great product if you didn't have to perform maintenance on it before you used it.
4,What I expected,"I got what I expected. It's functional and not too poorly made. The only problem I had was that the scratcher part was a little too sharp. I filed the sharp edges off and now it's great. The rolling wheels still have no function for me, but they don't get in the way."
4,A Good Buy.,"I ordered this for my husband & he really enjoys it. My only complaint about the product is that it was a little splintery at the scratcher part. Like the other person said, it can be sanded down with no problem. It was well worth a little sanding for the great price."
1,broken,product was broken in several places when we received it. It was also very flimsy and poorly made. The quality definitely was a reflection of the price. I never tried to return it because it wouldn't have been worth the money to ship it back for a refund because I definitely wouldn't have wanted an exchange. Next time I'll spend a little more for quality merchandise.
1,Not as pictured-arrived broken as well,"The back scratcher pictured is the one my husband used to have & lost. I purchased as a stocking stuffer as his back is always itchy, but when this arrived yesterday, it was a whole different back scratcher with no rotating balls & ""fixed"" balls were on the outside & broken off. Amazon has no recourse for this when hit the ""return"" & why. Buyer beware!"
2,Great story poor quality,You can tell this was in a pack of books the cover is cracking and look frail! Houldn't cost mor han a dollar!
1,Boca Beth Needs Spanish Lessons Herself.,"First and for most I'm rating the overall video and content not just one part. The video it self is very low quality. Anyone can set up a camera and tape a bunch of kids singing bi-lingual songs. Just step into a bi-lingual class at any school and you can find them. So why it's Award-Winning is beyond me. As a Bi-lingual mother and homeschool teacher, that learned Spanish at age 12. I can honestly say that Beth's overall Spanish is not good at all. When a English speaking person has a bad Spanish speaking accent, guess what... your children will have a bad English-Spanish accent when learning Spanish. When she says a simple word for example; VEO (""see"" in Spanish) she pronounces it BEO with a B not a V. This is simply not acceptable and our children should be hearing it how it is, not how she interprets Spanish. Thank You"
4,NOT comparable to Vasquez . . . .,"Sorry, but though this is a good book and a fun read, the art is not even close to Jhonen's fine work, so if you're a Jhonen fan and are buying this (as I did) you WILL be dissapointed with the artwork and writing. There were plenty of funny parts, as well as interesting death scenes, but if you want something really great go with Vasquez."
1,I Hate Roman dirge,"Roman Dirge made me buy this book, although in a purely metaphysical sense. I hate him for this. This was a complete waste of a perfectly good eleven dollars that could have been donated to poor starving puppies. God, it was even a waste of tree pulp and soy based ink. Don't beleive the other reviewers, especially the ones that say this is similar to Jhonan's masterul creations. If you like Squee, JTHM or Devi, you will be repulsed by this poorly drawn (and thoroughly un-entertaining) load of badly rhyming fairy tales and a dead girl with no plot or personality. Yes, it does bare some resemblance to J. Vasquez's comics, but the similarity is so sick it's a mockery of all thigs Jhonen labored over. Good drawings save bad plot. Good plot saves bad drawings. This book, therefore, is beyond redemption."
1,Garbage. Dirge can't write or draw at all.,"Terrible. Dirge does nothing but rip off Jhonen Vasquez. I am offended by the poor quality of the art in this book, which I did not buy, but had the misfortune of reading while at a friends house. It was so bad, I had to read the whole thing. The only positive aspect of this collection of ""comics"" is an inclusion of a single page strip by Mister Vasquez himself. I love sick humor, but if you care at all about art, originality, or quality story telling, stay the hell away from anything Roman Dirge does. Consider yourself warned."
2,only half satisfied,"I think its wonderful that Warner Bros has decided to release on DVD School Dayz/Spellbound and Tech Wars/Disappearing Inque to each contain 6 episodes and priced with a reasonable price. However, I am extremely disapointed at the fact that the first 3 episodes of School Dayz/Spellbound HAVE ALREADY BEEN RELEASED as the ""bonus episodes"" in the Batman Beyond Movie DVD. This is irritating the heck out of me. I was so looking forward to 6 wonderful episodes I do not yet own, only to get 3 new episodes."
1,DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!,It's an understatement that many of us feel ripped off by WB's attempt to unfairly empty our wallets. If we refuse to buy these horribly priced episode dvds and at the same time purchase the available box sets that are of value then we can make some headway. They are in the business of making $$$. Slowing their cash flow will force them to give us consumers' products we demand or risk losing our disposable income. Die-hard fans of this series and other series must convince every parent to withhold from purchasing these dvds until full seasons are made available.
1,Patrick Gets Hearing Aids,"I am very disappointed that this is identical to the free ""Oliver Gets Hearing Aids"" book that can be found online. If I had checked author names, I would have figured it out, but I learned abou the Oliver book after I found this one!"
3,THE 'Crying' remix!!!,"Alcazar do a pretty tepid version of 'Don't You Want Me' - although the Almighty mix is good - but the reason to get this is Ivan's X mix of 'Crying': superb! Amongst the many versions of 'Crying' this must rate the best, so if you love the original don't miss this one!"
2,Not a good product...,I bought two of these CD's and the sound quality leaves much to be desired. The singing is by a chorus and the background music is too loud. You really can't even understand what they are singing. My daughter lost interest fast. Don't waste your money on these...
4,Fun for the whole family,I used to play Tripoly with my family. It's easy enough for younger kids to play and still fun for the adults.
5,"Brave, Intimately Honest Account","Kudos to Frank Schaeffer. He has eloquently and honestly chronicled what so many of us with loved ones in the United States Marine Corps have gone through during this war. I couldn't put down the book that he co-authored with his son while my brother was at Parris Island and as soon as I found out that he had a new story to tell I purchased this book. It has not disappointed me. It is another book that I couldn't put down. The roller coaster ride that starts the minute you find out that your loved one is going to be deployed sometimes seems like something that only you are going through but after reading this book I can see that this is a shared experience. This book has helped to validate what my family has felt and gone through. If you have a loved one in the military (even if you don't) I recommend reading this brave, intimately honest account of the Schaeffer family's experience."
5,Where can we get this book?,"I was given ""The Magic Garden"" as a young girl by my mother, who was given it by her mother. Both my mother and I managed to lose it after reading it and are desparately trying to find another copy of this book. If anyone knows where we can get one, would you please let us know? It is very special to both of us as violinists..."
3,"bought it for ""Louie Louie""","I bought the album just for the song ""Louie Louie"". The other songs are ok but I have heard better."
3,Pretty Not too Practical,"Looks lovely on the front porch, beautiful glass, but too deep and takes too much nectar and only two ports."
4,good.,"I don't like that I have to take the case off to be able to cradle it into my speaker, but other than that the case is great, and for the price I can't complain."
5,This little piggy went to market,"Once again, BBC outdoes its self with adapting books to TV. This time it is with a Margery Allingham mystery, Camion. Screenplay by Jill Hyem.Peter Davison as Albert Campion and his faithful companion Brian Glover as Magersfontein Lugg are so good in this 1989 TV series that even when you read the book you think of them. I have to admit that I have not read this book yet.Campion receives a mysterious letter from ""The Mole"" it tells him of a school acquaintance (nicknamed Piggy) that just passed away. Campion go to the funeral and there hears a snorting sound that piggy used to make clearing his throat (thus the nickname). We get close up views of characters that are suspect. Campion thinks little of this until three months late with it looks like piggy died again.Is Piggy really dead this time or did we hear another snort? Moreover, what is this all about?Campion - The Complete First Season"
2,Didn't care for it,"I read the sample first, and it gave the impression of a strong, magical family. I wanted to know what happened next. But on reading the rest, the family is completely dysfunctional.I'm sorry, maybe it's just me. But I felt the book insults Witchcraft, Christianity, and women in general. The Witches seem to have little power- they can't protect themselves from the extremists past or present; the Christians are comic book; and the women all allow themselves to be victimized by various people, including family, without seeming to have even basic self protection skills (much less magic). If you can't hex someone, at least bang him over the head with something! It didn't get better, I thought the ending was horrible.I removed the book from my reader-"
1,I've seen better looking Cow Pies,"My God, what was this stupid woman thinking? Sweet mother of jesus this is some awful writing. For the love of God DONT read this book if you value your life or sanity. This book isnt worth the paper it's written on. If you're going to read this ""literary masterpiece"" at least prepare a strong rope tied in a noose, and a sturdy headbeam. That is all."
1,Too long and full of useless info,"Do you buy computer books by the pound? Peachpit press seems to think so. This book is so full of mindless babble, (N.B. all tech writers. You're not actual writers. Don't try to tell me a story. Give me the facts, Jack.) lame 'tips' and other [stuff] that I got fustrated and returned it for a Quickstart book. Sorry, Mr. Writer, but if I wanted to be entertained I would have bought an novel."
3,"Not great, not good, but informative","There's a good chance that those who find D. Hofstadter entertaining will like this book: it's very much in the same vein as his works. Those who can't stand Hofstadter, or actually know something about music, will probably hate it. Altschuler just has this grating tone; it's as if he wants you to believe everything he's saying is worth its weight in gold; perhaps it's because he went to an ivy school. Poor boy.I read some insightful words about Hofstadter's GEB lately, and they apply here as well: ""mathematicians find the mathematics almost dangerously oversimplified, but the stuff about music interesting; musicians find the talk about music banal, but the stuff about math interesting."" In other words, when you mix two or more branches of knowledge with the intent of coming to some sort of synthetic point of view, you should probably know what you are talking about!"
5,Right up there with . . .,"Sometimes A Great Notion is right up there with Absalom, Absalom! The Sound and the Fury, Moby Dick, Catch-22, and Flannery O'Connor's stories. It is simply one of the great American novels.It belongs in the unappreciated masterpieces category along with Under the Volcano, Cat's Eye, The Fool's Progress, Little Big Man , and A Death in the Family."
4,sometimes a great notion,"i got about halfway through the book. i thought it was pretty good, but i really got sick of some of the ramblings. there was one section in particular that was WAY whacky, and i think it could have been written alot better, or excluded from the book. you can tell though, that kesey is a good user of words and commands them well. But i had to quit it, maybe it just wasnt the right time for me to read the book. theres no doubt in my mind though that that one scene, i think it was around when he started to desrcibe leland, it was really chaotic and i thini kesey is the only one who really knows whats going on with it"
5,Dying hound grasps for life,"I've lived in the Oregon coast range for the past 21 years and in Oregon since 1966. This is it. When our Golden Retreiver/Border Collie got on the trail of something[deer, elk, bear?] in 35 degree rain and didn't come back for 19 hours, all I could think of was Kesey's ability to get inside the dog's head in Great Notion and how Nicky was feeling while desperately trying to find her way back home through the checkerboard of clear-cuts, old growth and everything in between that makes up the tangle of the Umpqua/Siuslaw divide. If you want to understand Western Oregon and [old growth] Oregonians, this is the best book to read...it may well be the Great American novel...I first read it in '66, and on rereading found it had lost nothing...all bow to the Springfield Creamery and the bus trip from the Farm to the Springfield Xmas parade on a rainy Saturday in '66..."
5,"Best Cookie Book in My collection,","I refer to this book constantly. The recipes are easy, ingrediants easly found arond the house (a huge plus), and despite rather simple ingrediahts the resutls are delicious. Each of my family has a different favorite, so they keep me hoppingn but their appreciaton is worth it. Besides, who wants a hard bite sized cookhyou can have these gynormous soft, delicious delecacies. I haven't made every recipe in the book, but plan to. Every cookie so far has met with rave comments from school bake sales, to church socials, and to (okay, I admit it) just when I want to make a huge batch of delicious chocolate filled cookies all for meysef. I plan to buy 8 more marketplace copies today since they are cheap. I'll give them as gifts and my own copy is dog-eared from use so I can finally replace My thanks to the authors for creating easy cookis from recipes easily found around the house that are so very delicious and easy to make, even for a novie."
3,"Ok cookbook, but nothing earth-shattering in terms of recipes or techniques","As an amateur foody, I love trying new recipes and seeing different ways of doing things. I was also quite excited that the author obviously agrees with me that the bigger the cookie the better... however overall there just weren't very many recipes in here that I was all that interested in. Also not near enough pictures to go along with the recipes. I want to see what the end product looks like, as well as any special instructions that need to be followed to create these... Just not enough information.That being said, there are several recipes in here that I can't wait to try next Xmas, but as far as cookbooks go this thing is pretty average. I don't regret the purchase, but I'm not raving about it either."
2,"Lots of material, but very weak analysis","This book contains several very readable chapters that review organizations, movements and projects that any student of social action and community advocacy should be aware of. Sadly, the book leaves out any effort smacking of controversy or campaigns dealing with identity (where some of the largest efforts today at social change come from). Worse still, it paints controversy in change efforts as backwards. Several of the projects covered are also elite-directed, and not very participatory. The real nail in the coffin, however, is that their analysis is at the level of simply reporting ""what people told us."" E.g., the authors never ask if purported results are real, or should be truly attributed to the campaigns in question."
3,Don't buy this case!,"Please, do yourself a favor and do not buy this case for your Ipod Nano. The only good parts is it looks good and protects the Ipod well. Bad things:The headphone port is too narrow! I had to stretch it out by sticking a pencil in there for the headphone cord to fit!The port for the hold switch is also to narrow. Also the hold switch is to far in unless you have long finger nails. The case is kind of thick.The Ipod Nano doesn't even fit in well! The Ipod Nano will shift back and move while inside of the thing.Also, my case came defective! The rubber was already peeling when it got here!If you want a good Ipod Nano case:iSkin 2G nano Skin for 2nd Generation iPod nano 3 pack, Chill pack (Viper/Sonic/Arctic)"
3,4th edition is a ripoff,Only a few pages of the 4th edition are new so if you have the 3rd don't bother with the 4th. The publisher should be ashamed.
2,Coleman Not made like they were in the old days...,The top rusted after only a few uses. The insert didn't say closed and coffee grounds were at the bottom.
1,Short-Life Percolator,"Having recently taken a new job and renting a home in Alabama, we decided to hold onto our primary residence and selectively move certain goods to the temprary house. This included an automatic coffee maker which drove the need for a replacement in our primary residence. We liked the concept of the Coleman 14-Cup Enamelware Coffee Percolator and ordered on line. It arrived with several paint chips missing, which we accepted as ""product allure"". However, after two uses the glass knob on the top cracked and broke, rendering the product useless. I'm hesitant to replace the knob for fear it will continue to break. Don't buy this product - it's no longer manufactured. Bad, bad decision."
1,glass-top coffee-pot lid,glass top flimsey and breaks easily. replacement glass costly if available!!!!!!!would not recommend to anyone this product is very cheap and flimsey!!!!
2,Super Bummed!,I was so excited to get this percolator. I was completely bummed once it got here. There are a few things that bother me. The first and biggest issue I have is the knob on the lid broke while I was making coffee the 2nd time I used it. I heard it snap but wasnt sure what happened till I went to take the lid off and the knob fell off - and there were small pieces of glass in the coffee. This obviously is an issue with this particular percolator as they sell replacement knobs on the coleman website. The 2nd issue is the basket and stem are very poorly made in my opinion. Mine was slightly bent upon arrival. It had nothing to do with the packaging as it was packaged well. If I was to purchase another I would find a different one for sure. Dont waste your money.
1,"Did the job, while it was working.","This thermometer does the job you can expect from a thermometer-it gives you the temperature whithin whatever you are cooking. If this thing was working I can't see any reason why not giving it a 5, but since mine broke after a few months (like previous reviewer)I can't give it more than 1 star. $20 doesn't seem to be much but for a small piece of electronics I think that you should get more for your money."
1,Junk. Do not waste your money.,Probe stopped working after 15 minutes. Do not waste your money on this product. Manufacturer clearly has little or no quality control process in place.
1,Just set a $20.00 bill on fire instead of buying this thing,"Was great while it worked which was about 2 months. From reading all of the reviews about these things, it seems like they are all garbage. Not just this brand and model, all of them have a high failure rate."
5,Heavy duty,"Use this to charge and or load up my Sansa Clip Plus. The cord is not cheap or flimsy and it sure beats the 3"" cable that came with it. The length makes it easy to charge overnight while it is connected to my clock radio."
1,An opinion Quoted from David A Vise,"Author of ""The Bureau and the Mole"" David A. Vise, states the following: p154 ""The KGB recuited Holdt as an operative and then implemented a covert campagne to boost circulation of the book in Europe, widely disseminating the negative images of America"". Note that Holdt is Danish. Not American. I would suggest that he introspect his own country or perhaps Russia, China, Iraq, Iran, etc."
3,OK,not quite what i expected in that the beginning there is a lot of discussion of women in the faith and their place. I was expecting the bible with encouraging words for women. perhaps i haven't gotten to that part yet.
1,"Awful, really people, stop it!","This CD is such a disapointment. I've been a fan since The Refreshments days, have been to the Mexico shows and have even spent some time travelling to differnet cities to see this band. The one plus is that if you listen to this crazy crappy cd and then put in their last effort, Americano, you will appreciate Americano more and instead of that being a 2 star record it's a 3 star. Anyway I don't know what happened but this entire album seems contrived. Junebug sonds like a them to a kids tv show. This is the most disapointing albub of Roger's to date. If you asked me he was damn near perfect with every album through Sonoran Hope and Madness. He faultered a little with AMericano but this is the worst. A very contrived effort filled with empty lyrics and mindless head bopping songs.This is very disapointing. Don't waste your money."
1,Warning : No Windows 7 Drivers,Windows 7 does not recognize this device at all and the company web page doesn't have any drivers because it claims Windows will automatically recognize it.Do not buy this device.
5,our son's favorite book series,"We got this collection for our son because he LOVES Ralph. He read Ralph S Mouse first, toward the end of kindergarten (he's a strong reader), & wouldn't go to sleep until he finished it. He woke up the next morning & started reading Runaway Ralph (we had checked both books out of the library). We had never seen him fall in love with a character the way he did Ralph. He read the books so many times, we finally had to buy him his own. Ralph has gone on vacation with us, he has to have his own pancakes. This character has become such a sweet part of our son's imagination, we just love it."
2,"Yeah, South East","This movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I didn't realize when I purchased it that it took place in S.E., D.C., which hit home for me.Although I enjoyed the fact that it touched on portraying real life issues, it lacked something to maintain my interest. It was too slow and rather boring. Lots of profanity as well."
1,Movie,"I cannot give this movie a rating because I did not view it, I only looked at the info about it."
1,Money Matters,"Another waste of time. I wanted to see this film because of the actors, but it proved to be nothing that I would ever watch again. just no good."
1,Broke,"The first time I used this charger; when I went to unplug my phone the usb part got cought IN the phone which obviously broke the charger, then i needed tweezers to get the pieces out of my phone. Waste of money. Very dissapointed."
1,What a disgrace!,"Being a Opera fanatic, tenor fanatic, Puccini fanatic, Verdi fanatic, etc. etc. , I find this production dreadful. Why DID the Met chose THIS??Jose Carreras is not as good as he is now. His voice is scratchy, and rather squeaky during the start.Nessun Dorma and Che Geldida Mania are my favorite Puccini arias. Jose Carreras gave the worst performance of that aria I have ever heard in my whole life. Let's just say, he is so mis - cast as Rodolfo.The noise in the backround is beyond what can be accepted. There is coughing, wheezing, etc. Not my type.If you are a La Boheme fan and a Carreras fan, keep looking for another. Mostly, a La Boheme casting Pavarotti or Placido is not a bad idea to own.So here I am shot down once again! Sorry."
4,Met La Boheme DVD,"As an owner of the same opera on video, I knew that I was getting another wonderful opera experience. The clarity and wonderful sound of DVD made this opera even more enjoyable. For me, Carreras' Rodolpho is the benchmark performance and no other singer even comes close. Its an experience every opera lover should have."
2,La Boheme should be younger,"I agree that Zeffirelli's production and voices of leading roles are wonderful. However, I believe that La Boheme is the story about young women and men - who have no money but a lot of energy to find a small joy every day and enjoy their life. Unfotunately, this DVD tells a sad story only, and I was not able to find any youth and sense of humor, which should be prominetly existent in every great La Boheme."
4,positive.I purchased the VHS,"Unfortunately the introduction by AMOZON cites G Puccini as one of the stars of this production ( which is of course true (in essence) but failure to mention MS Stratas is a major blow to us who use the discography of this fine companhy to do our shopping.In any case, the Zefferelli production at the MET is fine not only on the VHS but in person."
3,Great production... but singers beware!,"There are two problems with this DVD that buyers,(especially singers)should know.Number one, subtitles, or more accurately, the lack thereof. The only subtitles available are in English and they cannot be turned off.Number two, I agree with other reviewers that Carreras does a marvelous job of acting and of singing. But on this DVD, one thing he does not have that Pavaratti most certainly would is a high C! Che Gelida Manina is marked down a half-step and only goes to a B natural.I realize these things might not matter to the casual viewer, but as an opera singer I bought the DVD not only to watch but to learn as well. In order to do this I would have certainly appreciated subtitles available in the original Italian as well as all the music sung in the original key!"
3,"Great performance, so-so presentation","While I agree with most of what other reviewers say about this DVD, I have to disagree with both Amazon's editorial review on one point - about this being ""the best visual treatment of this opera that anyone's ever likely to see."" I highly doubt that: Not only is the lighting very dark throughout and the picture not widescreen, one would think that, for a DVD, the producers would film without an audience as has been done for several other opera DVDs in my collection.Aside from the so-so presentation, the music is wonderful and the performances are excellent. I just wish the audience wasn't clapping over all my favorite parts."
4,Surprisingly good!,"Don't let he MTV logo on the box affect your decision to see this! I was surprised to see that there is a solid story here, characters with personalities, some great acting, and no cheesy nudity. A girl returns to the town she grew up in after a number of years away to attend a funeral. She had been sent away after her sister's funeral with a brother-in-law and niece as her onlt family left. She starts to have blackouts, visions through sketches, and people begin to die. It even has some dark and creepy elements. I recommend this and I would watch it again, even own it.There is nothing ""MTV"" about this movie! :)"
3,WHAT DOESN'T LIE BENEATH...,"....is a coherent script. Even with that in mind, BENEATH, an MTV co-production with Paramount, holds your interest with a modicum of shrieks. HEROES' Nora Zehetner plays Christie, a young girl traumatized by the death of her sister, in an accident in which she was the driver. Although she survived the crash, Vanessa was burned severely and dies a year later. When people close to Vanessa start dying, Christie is convinced there's more to Vanessa's death than meets the eye.One major problem I found is Christie's ""visions"" and her drawings of things and people she doesn't know...there is no real explanation for them, and when the script force feeds a reason, it doesn't make sense. Zehetner is good, as is Matthew Settle as her brother in law. Not bad, but no classic either."
4,Great! And... Could Be Better,"If you cook CFS(chicken fried steak), you need one of these. Use a cut of lean sirloin (instead of the normal grizzly cube steak) and tenderize it with this tool and you will have chicken fried steak that will near melt in your mouth. Works effectively on meat up to 1/2"". I just purchased my 3rd one of these (they make great gifts). I think it is the best tenderizer available for CFS.The only thing that I think needs a little design work is the whole handle thing. It is not very compfortable to hold and difficcult to see your work on smaller cuts of meat. Not sure what I would change, but there is an opportunity to improve it."
4,Great video!,"This video is fun and good for beginners. Some of the moves are a little difficult to pick up on, but with some practice one should get them."
4,EXCELLENT,"LOVE THIS WORK OUT , CHALLENGING AND EFFECTIVEI HAVE JUST STARTED AND WILL ADD WEIGHTS ONCE I GET USE TO THE WORKOUT ROUTINESBUT OVERALL I AM VERY HAPPY WITH ANOTHER 10 MINUTE SOLUTION WORKOUT DVD"
1,I'd use chemicals from the start,"This product worked fine for 2 months. Now the thing just KEEPS saying ""low salt"" we've added 90 pounds of additional salt to a pool that was crystal clear 2 days ago and this same saltwater system was working fine then. But now the thing just keeps saying low salt. We've done the maintenance as according to the book that came with the product, but it's just not working. So, I guess the product is now ""broken."" Yes, the thing comes with a 2 year warranty, but today is Saturday and Intek isn't open until Monday. Now we've got a green pool to look at (we're not swimming in it) and who knows if we'll even get a replacement or refund before the end of the pool season?? We'll find out monday when Intek is actually open. But, take a lesson from our experience and just buy chemicals in the beginning. We've spent $205.73 on the saltwater system, and $60 on the salt so far this season. What a waste. Next time, we're sticking with chemicals!"
2,Silly Me,"Purchased Intex saltwater water system model cs8110 in summer of 2010. Consistently had problems with unit showing low salt, even after adding recommended rates. Calling Intex customer service ended up being a waste of time as well.But hey-- all this is my fault, not the manufacturer who made the defective system. Silly me! I should have known ahead of time they were going to sell me a defective system and I would have saved the receipt. Heads up! No receipt.... no help from Intex."
4,"Great story, fantastic art","I didn't care for Ron Marz's work on Silver Surfer - but, man can he write a great Batman! Wrightston's people and creatures are a wonder to behold. The story unfolds like the best Aliens movie - it's fast-paced, fun and full of action."
1,Body Lotion,I bought this specifically because it had he body lotion. I can get the perfume anywhere. The body lotion was like water and a yellow color. It is suppose to be thick and white. This must have been very old.
4,Even better live,"Peter Mulvey is a fine live performer. His shows are worth a see. His music is very intellegent, witty and tuneful pop music."
2,"Easy setup, not well made","The package arrived in great shape and very quickly. Unfortunately, this dartboard leaves a lot to be desired. It doesn't even work as advertised, it punctured on the first use. I don't know why they included tennis balls, seems rather random to me. I give 2 stars for Amazon's speedy shipment, and the box was nice."
5,Excellent from start to finish,"Originally available only by mail order, this was Zappa's love letter to those who always said they love Zappa's guitar playing. Zappa loved his fans and was completely loyal to them. Originally a 3-LP set it is a collection of live and studio tracks spanning periods from about Zoot Allures up to release time, with guest spots by Jean-Luc Ponty (with Zappa on Bouzouki) and Roy Estrada (on bass). All original stuff, no reruns here. The sound quality is absolutely superb and there is no question that Zappa's guitar is the main attraction. Well paced, good listening, accessible grooves, and superb musicianship make this an essential for Zappa guitar fans and Zappa fans in general. A book of Zappa's solos transcribed by Steve Vai (""Frank Zappa - GUITAR"") drew a lot of material from this album. A personal favourite from this album is ""Five-Five-FIVE""."
2,Rip off remaster,"This CD has some great songs, and it also has some songs that just sound horrible. The bass drum sounds the same as the YAWYI CD, a notched low end EQ. That's about all they did. I mean, some songs on here have the most annoying guitar sound, with really annoying compressed drums. Yuk, it is mostly a sonic mess, aside from horsie and stucco."
1,Where have all the good Ryka shoes gone?,"I have bought many, many pairs of Ryka shoes over the last ten years and this one is ahuge disappoinment. I have this same style in white and so the black seemed a natural to purchase too. Something is different about it and it does not fit the same way that the white pair does. These leave my feet aching. So I wonder if this is a ""second"" or one that did not make the regular quality control? I only wear these now when I am outside and am going to get dirty since they are black and do not show the dirt. Good for mowing the yard on a riding lawn mower if you understand what I mean. Do not buy these if you have been happy with Ryka in the past as they are not the same shoe that you have loved."
2,Just like 'Out of Sight' sdtk...,"Having watched this movie, I had the same reaction as I did when I watched 'Out of Sight"". Great music by David Holmes. I purchased the soundtrack for 'Out of Sight' the next day. And there was the dialogue.Please, please, please don't do this anymore!The soundtrack for 'Snatch' has, if I remember, 3 dialogue tracks. But they are on separate tracks (not to mention they're only like 5 seconds long at most). So, if I'm not in the mood to hear the dialogue, I can skip them (along with 'Lucky Star' by Madonna, yikes...)It really is unfortunate that this had to happen to what would have been a great soundtrack"
4,The Dialogue Doesn't Bother Me.,"A lot of people complain about the dialogue. I enjoyed the film so much, that the dialogue put at the beginning of most of the songs helped to recapture the feel of the film.Holmes plays down the techno/breakbeat aspect of his music and focuses more on what could be termed Barry Adamson-esque lite. Many songs have the feel of the bumpers between segments on National Public Radio.Pulp Fiction started the trend of adding dialogue. If you burn this CD after buying it, you can skip a good deal any dialogue.The chug-along-pace makes this a great cd for driving. And the Cuomo, Presley, etc., tracks shake up the mix."
2,"reissue the CD without the dialogue, and I might buy it","I never buy soundtracks, yet I thought the music was so good for this film that I've snooped around on the web to hear samples. I agree with many others who've complained about the dialogue. It's distracting and unnecessary. Too bad."
2,Could have been better,"I was expecting the cool music from the movie, not dialogue excerpts with background music. All it needed was the chime so you could turn the page..."
3,it's great for what it was intended,"if u expect to hear the best record of the world, you're looking in the wrong place, this movie soundtrack was created for that porpouse, to be a movie soundtrack, to complement the movie, for that reason u will find great rythims but u wont find great songs with some clear exceptions such as 69 police and a little less conversation, but overall its a great movie soundtrack but not a great record"
2,Great music wasted by dialogues,"I have several dozens of soundracks as I am hardcore collector of them. After getting out of the movie theater, I was sure this soundrack was one to buy and to remember.It's really too bad that somebody at Wea/Warner Bros does not seem to understand that if I go and spend 20$ to buy the music I loved during a movie, I do not want to hear the dialogues on it. Had I wanted to, I would have bought the DVD or ripped movie sound clips with my 1980 tape player off a rented DVD; I am not spendig 20$ to hear the same dialogue covering the same music at exactly the same time for tens of times until I hate the track.Don't make the mistake to spend money on this one: the music is great but it will sit on your shelf after you listen to it a couple of times."
4,Maximo earphones,"Beautiful sound, as good as iPod's. With the 3 ear sizes they provide, you can get an excellent fit. Attractive case. Lots of cable. A bit expensive, however."
3,Decent product for a decent price,Appears to be a well made product at a resonable price. Good volume and clarity when connected to my Sansa player BUT bass quality AND isolation of outside noise are nowhere near as good as my Shure IC2 and Emotic Research ER6i isolation earbuds but the price is much less.
1,TING!,"While these ear buds do have a very nice bass sound, they do not stay in place. I was constantly having to shove first one and then the other bud back in place.But that isn't the bad part.The part that drove me nuts was the metal tinging that these made all the time. It was like someone was using a dog clicker or the top of a Snapple bottle... except it was inside my ear!Click. Pop. TING!AAAAAAAAagh!It does not matter how good the rest of the product is if the end result is that it drives you insane. And these were driving me insane."
1,Bones Revisited,"I've never watched two shows that so closely resembled each other. Even down to the psychiatrist giving advice to members of the team and their romantic interactiona with each other. This is a great show if you havn't watched Bones, but if you have you will certainly not apprciate Jordan."
5,Great Movie for the Entire Family,"This is a very enjoyable movie that is fast paced and full of adventure. Several different storylines are linked to the event of the ""falling star"". These stories come together and create a roller coaster ride between comedy (sometimes quite dark at times), thrills, fantasy, and romance. There are some great acting scenes by well known stars that add to the fun, especially the ""Lightning Gathering Pirates"" and their flying ship.While some of the scenes might be too intense for the ""wee ones"" it is still a movie that can be enjoyed by the family if the ""Harry Potter"" films are their cup of tea."
5,Overlooked gem,"This apparently little known movie features a great cast, fun & lighthearted storyline and a fantastic soundtrack. I thoroughly enjoyed the humor, dialogue, special effects and action sequences. Similar in genre to the Princess Bride, but with higher production values. I don't recommend it for kids as its a little dark/scary at times for young children... Definitely a good date movie, etc. Highly recommended."
1,Did not download,For some reason only a small portion of the movie downloaded. Rather a disappointment. Will have to try to get credit for this item.
2,Short of the Mark,"While writer Gaiman aspired to write an adult fairy tale, ""Stardust"" falls short on both accounts. Another reviewer correctly identified it as a new ""Princess Bride,"" an adult spoof of children's fairy tales. And, as a spoof, it might have worked, except for the graphic violence, exploding heads and several impalings. Bing Crosby once asked, ""Would you like to swing on a star, carry moonbeams home in a jar . . . or would you rather be a jerk?"" ""Stardust"" chooses to be jerky. When will filmmakers realize that the successes of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings are not about the gee-whiz special effects and sweeping vistas but about the integrity of the writing. ""Stardust"" insults the genre of fantasy rather than complementing it. Want to read an adult fairy tale? Try Stephen Donaldson's Thomas Covenant series. Want to see an adult fairy tale? Try John Boorman's ""Excalibur."""
5,I Love this movie!,"I love this movie! I expected a lot of things from this movie when I first picked it up and originality was not one of them. Words cannot tell you how happy I was after watching this film. It's got everything fantasy films these days are lacking; wit, sophistication, adventure, and actors who can actually give their characters depth. Its a wonderful story that leaves you wanting more. Stardust makes me wish that more film makers had the guts to step away from their tried and true Hollywood formulas and try something thats decidedly ""out of the box."" Buy it, you won't regret it."
4,The Best Movie You Never Heard Of,"Stardust is a wonderful, rich, fantasy film for adults. Michelle Pfeiffer is stunning as the wicked Dark Witch who seeks to find a fallen star (Claire Danes) and cut her glowing heart out of her chest, which will restore her beauty and bestow long life.The star has fallen to Earth as a result of accidentally being knocked out of the sky by a ruby necklace. The necklace is sought by evil, backstabbing (literally) brothers. Whoever finds the necklace will inherit the magical kingdom of Stormhold.A young man, smitten by the local beauty, sees the falling star and pledges to bring it back to prove his love. Unaware of the nature of the star, as well as his own heritage, he is soon on a quest to save the star from the forces who would kill her in a particularly despicable way.The movie has sex, murder, violence, so is not for kids. Must-see."
5,"If you liked ""Princess Bride"". . .","I saw this film in the theater with my wife, brother, his wife and their two kids--a girl 16 and a boy 13. To a person, we all loved it. It is clever, funny and a visual treat. It does not take its self too seriously and thus drew comparisons with us to ""Princess Bride""--which is a favorite of mine. This movie some how slipped beneath the radar in the theaters even though I recommended it to everyone who would listen and never found anyone who saw it who did not like it. Check it out if you want a fun escape. Robert Deniro is hilarious."
4,Starry eyed for Stardust*******No Spoilers*******,"Like most other movies based on books, this movie left out several scenes that I would have loved to see on the big screen. However with that being said, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I actually enjoyed it. The casting (with the exception of Sienna Miller) was brilliant. Robert De Niro is absolutely hilarious! Its worth watching the movie just to see his character in action! Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, I'd be skeptical about watching with small children. The movie isn't gory, but young kids won't follow the plot well, especially the situation with the seven brothers. I give Stardust 4 stars!"
1,Disc didn't play,"I was very disappointed that this disc did not play on any of my devices; BlueRay Player, Mac or PC."
3,"MATTHEW VAUGHN, OPUS 2","*** 2007. Based on Neil Gaiman'sStardust, this film was co-written and directed by the British director Matthew Vaughn. The thing is basically a fairy tale with witches, a mean prince, a falling star and a naive hero. Nice production design and an excellent choice for a rainy afternoon with your kids. As for the artistic value and the originality of STARDUST, just let me say that the film is an hybrid mix of Rob Reiner'sThe Princess Bride (20th Anniversary Edition)and Hayao Miyazaki'sCastle in the Sky. Knowing this won't prevent you to buy or rent this film but, if you have an ounce of self-respect, you will certainly now haw before telling everybody that STARDUST is a new classic of the fantasy genre. Already forgotten."
5,Anything From Here is Great,"I've been buying huge canisters of these seasonings for years. I buy their pepper sauce by the gallon. You should buy one of everything they make. You won't be dissapointed.And...you should buy it NOW on AMAZON...because, due to the results of the recent election, you won't have a job much longer. That's ok though...I think the government will still give out the free phones and you can call all your friends and discuss what to do with your life in the post-consumerism world.Order now while supplies last. Paul may go out of business soon too."
5,my grammar bible,"I too still have my Warriner's from high school. The year 10 edition published in 1958. As an English teacher, then editor and now university marker and lecturer, I still find myself referring to it!! Times may have changed usage a bit, but the old rules can still be found here and applied."
5,Wonderful Wallet,"Very pleased to get this wallet. Myfirst eelskin wallet. I really like the vintage 40s look. Great storage for cards, though none for pictures or other paper cards. In all it exceeds my expectations. Great deal for the money!"
5,Another great Arhoolie Records collection,"Delightfully antique recordings from Mexico's fading ""string band"" tradition. If you normally find Mexican music too shrill to deal with, give this disc a shot... It's more closely tied to the European orchestral traditions that led to early Cuban and Puerto Rican dance style such as the danzon and tipica. Mexican polkas later became more manic and aggressive, but here the style is more relaxed and laid back -- really, it's quite lovely. The second half of this collection has even bigger suprprises: Mexican versions of the Hawaiian steel guitar style, and even a few gringo-style country tunes. Great stuff from the Depression era. Recommended."
2,Left me with a bad feeling,"This is one of the few times when I've read a book and found myself unable to complete it. The ghost writer did a fine job with what she had. The book is literate, the grammar is correct. Many of the passages about Faith are actually moving but this thing is so distasteful that I don't want to say anything good about it. A young girl is kidnapped, molested, held hostage and her dad writes a book about it so the ""true"" story can be told. Ick. The whole thing left me with a very bad feeling. I'm sorry I read it."
3,bringing Home Elizabeth,"I was really interested in this story & couldn't wait to read it. Unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations. Although a very sad & terrifying experience, I found the book to be repetitive and it mainly expressed how the family coped through different stages of the abduction through their faith in God. Captivating story but not enough detail for me."
1,Poorly Written,"This was a wonderful story of hope, faith and love all but spoiled by a completely incompetent ghost writer. The Smarts are not and do not claim to be authors. So they had Laura Morton to co-write the book for them and in 15 years as a freelance editor, I've never seen a writer do a worse job of a project. Instead of organizing the Smarts' story in an engaging, interesting manner, she managed to make them sound uneducated and scatterbrained. The story jumps all over the place and important connecting information is missing or incomplete. It was Ms. Morton's job to make it readable and she has failed miserably. If you can wade through the mess Ms. Morton has made of this book, the story itself is heartwarming. Good luck."
1,Don't waste your time reading this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Let me start by saying how bored I was reading this so called book. It has nothing to do with Elizabeth and it has all to do with her parents. Like they want to make some money out of Elizabeth being kidnapped. Why are there pictures of her parents wedding, pics of them growing up? I just don't get this book. This book should be about Elizabeth and only her. Thank goodness this book was a gift to me so I didn't waste my money on it. I was really disappointed as I read this book. It took me 2 months to read it because I can only read a couple pages before I fall asleep. I'm telling you don't waste your money. What is the purpose of this book? It sure wasn't about Elizabeth. The movie they made was better then this. I am so glad I am finished this book because trust me, I will never read it again and I don't recommend it to anybody either."
1,MONEY MONEY MONEY!!!!,"It is very sad to see parents use their daughter to rake in the money!!! Although the book is well written, you can see Mr. Smart running to the bank!!"
5,Heartbreaking and heartwarming,"This book was very powerful. I read all of it in one sitting. I just could not put it down. The whole tale of Elizabeth Smart is inspiring and a true miracle. Her family, her parents especially, are very strong people that I admire. It is wrong for people to assume they wrote this book for money. You do not know if that is true and how can you have so little compassion that you would actually insult a family that went through something so terrible. I truly respect Ed and Lois smart and I thank them for sharing Elizabeth's incredible journey with us."
2,Handy Mini Spotting Scope,"I bought this item becasue it was small and portable so I can take it to the indoor gun range with me.I like the portability of this item but the optic quality is not very good. I wish I bought a better quality scope.Also, you have to use a tripod with this item so if don't have one you have to buy one."
4,Cheaper at Home Depot,"I was upset to find out that Home Depot sells this item under the Husky brand name for 399.00. But, it works great and I am happy with my purchase. I would have saved about 70.00 after sales tax and I would have to go get it and go thru the sizeable task of getting someone to help me load it. Ordering from Amazon, I did get free shipping and the delivery people helped me and my son unload it."
4,"One of the best keyboards I've owned, but...","It didn't last as long as my other ones have. For the price, it lasted long enough - over a year. Wish they had this is a wider variety of colors though."
4,I don't have a spiffy title for my review.,"As stated above, I don't have a spiffy title for my review. However, if you'd like to hear raves about your dessert at a formal dinner party, mix up a batch of the Cataloupe Sorbet with Minted Melon from this cookbook. It's practically a staple in our home when we bring out the formal china!We did make a few changes to the recipe to make our lives easier. We buy a few slices of honeydew and watermelon off the local grocery store salad bar instead of entire melons that would go to waste. We don't use specially carved cantaloupe rinds to serve the sorbet. We also used dried mint instead of fresh for a stronger taste."
2,Not what I expected.....,"I thought this was gonna be more like the Popoff books....in depth reviews of the albums, so you get an idea of what is good and what to avoid. Instead, all you get is lengthy narratives only describing band member changes and album releases, and each band gets a discography. If you really care about Guitarist X replacing Guitarist Y, who then went on to form Band Z, then get this book. If you're trying to get an idea of what the bands sound like or which are the best albums, this won't tell you."
2,Naptime,"Karl Denson is a good musician. He has nice tone, and a lot of dexterity. Unfortunately, his skill as a composer has yet to be shown. This album is ultimately uninteresting, uninspired, and quite boring. The funk is half-baked and the melodies are shopworn. Granted, it's hard to measure up to his forebears like James Brown, Maceo Parker, George Clinton, Herbie Mann, etc. - but he doesn't even come close. Anyone wanting some funk should look to those other artists first. This album has very little to offer you. What a disappointing disc!"
3,small but good book,"Small book,too small for reading at circle time to group of children. Hardback cover is approx. 5""x5"" with pictures inside much smaller. This would be a nice book for one on one or independent reading, or leaving in science area, it has a lot of good information."
3,Disappointing,"Carlene Thompson is one of my favorite authors, so this book was a real disappointment.The culprit was obvious from the first time they appeared in the book. Perhaps if their behavior hadn't been so over the top, it wouldn't have been so obvious. A little subtlety would've definitely gone a long way here.I also found the dialogue to be very amateur and juvenile. Several times I actually read lines out loud to myself because I thought for sure I had to be wrong about what my eyes were seeing. It just was not well-written at all, and I caught several errors that a good proofreader could've easily found.I certainly hope the next book is up to what I've come to expect from Carlene Thompson."
4,Huge storm / dry campers,"The first night out in this tent there was a huge thunderstorm. I thought for sure water would come in or the stakes would come up as the tent rocked but neither did. I even had a dream that night that our sleeping bags got wet but when we woke up everything was dry. We still had pretty good ventilation even with the rain fly on. The tent took less than 10 minutes to put up/take down with two people and can be done alone in 15 min. The only thing I question about this tent is the ability to sleep 6. Six children, maybe. We had 2 adults and one 7 year old and our duffel bags with the clothes we needed for 2 days in there and I dont think we could have comfortably slept more than 4 total. This doesnt bother me since I bought the bigger size to have extra space, not to sleep 6 but it could be important to another buyer. Having been in leaky tents before I am so glad I purchased this one. I definitely recomend it."
4,Christmas Caroling,There's nothing like the sound of Christmas that comesfrom listening to the Ray Conniff Singers. This albumbrings out the memories of Christmas past. I couldn't playthis album enough.
5,Christmas Caroling with Ray Conniff Singers,I love Ray Conniff Singers Christmas albums. Each albums is very unique usually with no songs repeated.
3,christmas fun!,having a party? drag this out--it is a great sing along cd--will add hours of fun to any gathering. very upbeat and just plain fun!
2,Nice idea but does not work well,"Only fits on the passenger side for a 2003 Hyundai Santa Fe. Even still, I couldn't pull the axle with a ten pound slide hammer using this tool. I should have bought a wedge and larger pry bar instead. Save your money on this one.How I got off the axle shaft: drill a hole down the center of the inner cv-joint, and use a large bearing separator to pull it."
4,Quit thinking with your emotions,"Not a lot of people knew that Rock Hudson was gay until AIDS in Paris. Most people still think that JFK is a real family guy. Nobody knew that Brent Mydland was gay until his death; even the Grateful Dead was shocked. My point is that most people don't know that there is a vast difference between the image of an entertainer, and the real person.Regarding ELVIS by Albert Goldman; it may have seemed a harsh book to the fans that wanted to believe that Elvis was a lovable teddy bear, and a bitter pill to swallow. However, in the years since the publication of that book, volumes of evidence has come out to support every line that Albert wrote in that great book.I suspect that in the future, the same will hold true for THE LIVES OF JOHN LENNON. Evidence will come forward solidifying most of Albert's claims.If you don't want to know the truth, then just go and put on one of those ""Yeah, yeah, yeah"", records and hide your head in the sand."
3,Lurid & mean-spirited yet somewhat interesting,"One learns a lot about the strange world of the Lennons from this book, from the astrologers to business meetings to the lost weekend to the nature of John and Yoko's troubled relationship... there was a fair amount of research that can illuminate on its own. Having said that, Goldman does not know music and cannot write about it well; he also is somewhat ungenerous to the people in his story, he doesn't seem to see the positive too often. The book is also plagued by occasional racist attitudes from the author. However, despite all its flaws, the book kept calling me back to its grubby little world..."
1,Goldman is trash.,"Do not buy this book. This man is a liar who only intended to tarnish the reputation of a legend. Mind you, Lennon had his downs as well, but Goldman is ridiculous. He wrote that John could hardly stand to be around Sean and would not even hold him, but we see in countless interviews and footage that this is not the case. We see a man smothering a little boy with love that he did not receive from his own father. All we ever see is John with Sean. Let me just say that when Albert Goldman died nobody really missed his critiques. This book is garbage. Goldman was well-known for destroying reputations of people we love. He did an excellent job with Elvis and was working on Jim Morrison when he died. Do not waste your money. Lies, lies, lies."
1,Others who don't know me have their opinions --,"but they don't know me, so their opinions are without validity.The photograph on this edition is misleading: it makes it appear that Lennon is lying on his back, drunk or stoned or what have you. Actually, it is a photograph turned sideways, as it was taken of him sitting, during an interview.The book? Trash, like the many ""kiss and tells"" published AFTER Lennon was murdered and couldn't answer back."
5,Outstanding as well,"This one is a great story with too sisters fighting over each other and when they see each other over christmas after so long, it is a hard christmas for them. tell the ANGEL comes into there lifes."
1,Painful for anyone who has lost a beloved parent,"I started watching this movie when I was feeling a bit sick thinking that it would make me feel better. It started off interesting and had promise until the long-dead mother started baking pies and making hot chocolate, and then actually appearing. Anyone who has lost a beloved parent (or sibling, child, friend, etc.) always wishes for them to come back, but that never happens. I started feeling uncomfortable when the beds were suddenly made and the house was somehow completely decorated, but I turned the movie off when the dead mother appeared.The movie did not feel hopeful; it felt hurtful. I'm not against movies about angels helping families. I actually like that type of movie, but this one just felt wrong. There are so many other good holiday movies; I suggest skipping this one."
3,"Good movie, but more alcohol would've made it better...","Not only was the movie funny, but it was clever also. But regardless, the campy ending had to go. That just ruined it. As for the music, it's the newest shipment of mainstream puss, oh I mean punk rock, and one hit wonders. Scotty doesn't know is catchy, but nothing to buy the album over. As for jaker5064, keep watching that one scene over and over while you hit the rock. Don't let anyone tell you that you're slow for watching it over and over and still get a kick out of it. The OST, decent but catered to too much borderline emo rock and mainstream crap bands."
4,unknown song,any one knoww the name of the sog that keeps playing every time Cooper talks about hot European Sex.It played on the plane on the way to London when cooper was talking to Scotty about Hot European sex.
2,Can't figure out a song,"Alright, the song I am looking for is when the group is in Copenhagen I believe? Cooper goes off by himself to the local Sex Club, where they proceed to have all sorts of fun with him. I am looking for the song that plays in that scene. Its not very long, and its in German, but it sounded vaguely familiar. I have had no other luck finding it, so I thought I would ask here.Thanks, ~dash."
3,"Not bad, but really quite different taste than regular pancakes","These pancakes do cook beautifully, but to me still taste like air or cardboard, which is exactly why I was hesitant to buy a low carb mix. They are better than mixes found in stores, but for me, not good enough to buy again, especially for the amount you're getting in the box. I will try the 1 egg modification next time to see if there's any improvement on texture, so thanks for sharing that tip. I'm disappointed they aren't better, but it's hard to make low-carb taste like high-carb goodness. So, I would imagine this is an excellent product for some. I would just rather not have pancakes at all than compromise this much."
1,waste of money,"I didn't expect this low carb pancakes to taste like the yummy carb laden pancakes of my youth, but dear Lord, these pancakes were horrible. i followed the directions to the letter from the back of the box and made up the entire box (we love us some pancakes, and we have company over). The first few pancakes were the usual... not meant to be served. But they kept getting worse. Thick, gloppy, uncooked centers, and the parts we could eat tasted like glue and saw dust.The WORST part is, I called New Hope Mills to complain and they won't give me my money back or offer me a consideration. It must be user error. I can make pancakes, I've been cooking for over 25 years. In fact I made bisquik pancakes yesterday for the family.So.... Skip this mix. Unless you like raw centered glue/saw dust pancakes. In which case, Enjoy!!"
2,just a little tough,The batter whips up alright but for some reason the pancakes are a little on the rubbery side- they were cooked per pkg directions.
1,Tastes Like Whole Wheat Pancakes,"If you like whole wheat pancakes, you will love this mix. However, I personally don't like whole wheat pancakes. Atkins All Purpose Flour makes a much better tasting low carb pancake."
1,This is NOT the Atkins recipe,"Although this is advertized as the exact Atkins recipe (Hope MIlls bought the right to make it from Atkins), it is not. Very bland, very tough waffles and pancakes. What a rip-off!"
3,"It started out good, then got worse...","I did enjoy this season,There was good parts in it, but there was just too many characters that were easily forgotten, and way too much unrealistic magic [...](for the time period of 1878). The worst of all was the final episodes with all that fung shui [...] That just ruined it. The final episode was'nt all the great either, it just left you hanging..."
1,The worst you can think of...,"This books is utter rubbish : edited by Buyya and NOT written by Buyya. It's simply a compilation of research articles written by different authors.Rajkumar buyya has written ONLY the first introductory chapter, so his knowledge about the subject is seriously questionable.On the top of that in the entire book, there's no coherence or focus at all. It simply wanders from one author to another researcher.I am teaching at a university in Master's program, and I regret having purchased the book.If you're not sure of what I've written, simply go thru' the index and you'd find different authors."
4,more for studio use,This is an excellent addition for macro photography. It's not a great a product for walking around taking snapshots. A tripod and probably a ring flash setup will render the best results. Getting a sharp focus from an inch or so is very difficult with a handheld camera. Most effective with the 50 mm macro prime lens.
1,You get what you pay for!!!,"Sure the price is great, but the TV isn't. It takes about 8 seconds to power up. The tube color is not all that sharp, and is very difficult to adjust, there is not a ""preset"" setting from the factory. If I had known this I would have never bought it!"
3,"Low price, average quality.","I purchased this TV 2 days ago and have been pleased with it so far. While it does take longer to power on than my other televisions, it seems that it does not take as long for me as the other reviewers, around 5 seconds. The picture is OK, not spectacular, but average, and the sound is pretty good. For $169 this tv is a great deal for a bedroom other lower use area."
1,"terrible, burnt or stale, throw out","terrible, burnt or stale, no favor (double vanilla creme), should take out of stock and should not carry brand or charge to return, coffee"
3,It is mostly a list of functions with too few examples.,"Having used the Mathematica book index for years now,I know how it should be done. This isn't it...It lists the functions, but gives no example form for them.If you know MatLab, the help window is more usethan this book. A starter book not really worththe price."
2,Returned it,"I'm sure that almost every newly engaged woman goes through this. Their fiance gets down on one knee and lightning fast you're in a store looking for a wedding planner. I quickly flipped through this book and bought it without really thinking.It focuses a great deal on all of the ""pre-wedding"" parties such as an engagement party and bridal shower. I don't know about anyone else but 1) I don't plan on having an engagement party and 2) aren't my friends/relatives supposed to plan the bridal shower? I'm returning this one in favor of a planner more focused on weddings."
2,BAD PRODUCT,"well, what can I say ! here goes ! I bought this unit in feb 2006, and it was a great unit untill about 2 months ago,1-2008 ! the screen just went black and still had sound , I noticed the screen doing the wave from all sides of the picture and i thought it was my eyes playing tricks on me ! then boom, nothing !""READ REVIEWS"" I had bought the x-tra $$ warranty plan , what a joke that was ! I emailed thomson in texas, and they said to send to them all crated up ! you know how much that costs! I could buy a new one for that price, but the thomson customer assistants were very rude and could not speak english. they treated me like I a retard !DUH!! I asked for a reputable co,they could send to me in s.ca,I am paralized,and they were sending me people to come out and fix from palm springs,over 70 miles away ! DO not buy RCA products, there a joke, and there team of all players SUCK !!"
1,TRUFLAT shuts off then turns back on at random,"I bought a cheap TV - well not cheap but the cheaper one - and I got a cheap TV. This piece of crap turns off at will then comes back on. Great when your watching the Super Bowl!!!! Within two years of owning this RCA junk it started. RCA seems to have even worse quality than Samsung and that is saying something. The TV also is snowing on DVDs already. We bought the garbage to replace our whistling Magnavox. I'm running out of brands that are NOT on my ""Do not do business with"" list."
4,year of publication.,"this book was published in 1995, some edition likely published long time ago but the most common edition was published in 1995."
4,Great looking cards,"These cards just look great. The design are awesome, definitely a collector's item. They also look durable, for those people that want to actually play with them."
1,Waste of money!,"Without doubt, one of the worst books on trading I've read. There are perhaps some original ideas inside but none that is worthy to note. All I could see were charts, praises, and voodoo like things. Yes sure, the author has made some effort to discuss a few concepts, but I cannot see him justifying the same with test reports on how profitable they are/were. A lot of hype with little real content."
5,Great Product,"I've had this TV for 2 years now and couldn't be happier. For a tube TV the picture is great and flawless when using your XBox. I have a surround sound set up so i cant comment on the sound, but this TV is a great buy with unbelievable value."
1,just like reviewer #1,"I've had this tv for a bit over two years, and the picture is completely gone. It was nice while it lasted, but now it is just a huge radio with mediocre speakers. Boo!"
4,just what i needed,"this raft is a good one for the price. the only negative is the oars are cheap and too short and i will be buying new ones. inflates quickly even with a hand pump and holds 2 adults comfortably. Its not possible to put four people in the raft as it advertises, maybe 3 small adults. The raft is more stable in the water than i expected it to be."
4,Selling,This is a pretty good book on how to succeed in a sales career. The book is short and to the point. It also has practical exercises at the end of each section to guide you to success. If you take the time and do the exercises it can be very beneficial.
3,Overrated,"This book was very disappointing. There were some good parts, to be fair. The Monty Hall problem is one where she outthought many of the math PHDs in America. But it must be said: if you write a book with a title like Power of Logical Thinking, at the very least you ought to understand logical fallacies. She mistakenly says reductio ad absurdem is a logical fallacy (it isn't), and she either does not understand what the ad hominem tu quoque is or simply can't explain it well. Another huge flaw in the book is her (mistaken) belief that she is an expert in economics. It's like reading 50 pages of Larry Kudlow--free market fundamentalism disguised as intellectualism. She commits a logical fallacy of her own in the economics section, I must point out--in support of her views she quotes a single economist, conservative and later Bush adviser Larry Lindsey. That's known as the argument from authority; obviously one economist is not the sole source of the truth on economic matters."
4,Only for parents...,"My husband and I have been reading this book since the beginning of the year and it has been very helpful to us. We have decided, though, to put it on the shelf until we have children. A good percentage of the devotionals in this book focuses on relationships with your children, child-rearing, etc. We simply cannot relate with these topics yet. Otherwise, it is a great book. I would not recommend this book to couples without children or to those who have an empty nest!"
5,Couples devotional,Handy book to keep on the night stand. Some great stories from The Raineys which relate to the devotion for the day. I'm enjoying this no matter when I pick it up.
1,Dangerous drivel,"""I really love it when he hurts me, hurts me"": how can grown human beings put out this kind of dangerous drivel? Worse, it has that catchy nursery-rhyme type hook so of course all the kids are gonna be singing it, learning that sex is supposed to be painful for women, and that girls are basically receptacles for male genitalia. I'm saddened and disgusted that a record company whould release something as offensive as this, and even more saddened that it's a top 10 hit. Where are your minds, people? What do you think this is telling our children? What if, instead of rhymes about hurting women, it were about people of color? Would you notice then?"
3,so bad it's acctually hilarious,"my mom and i saw this on the new releases shelf at our local video store and instantly thought it looked like one of those ""so-bad-it's-hilarious"" movies...we were right :]if i saw this at a store for $10 or under i would buy it and watch it again with friends, it's so bad i love it!!the scene where the girls are being electrocuted at the end is so freaking hilarious, the fakey lightning/electricity bolts is amazingand i love that tranny who is never really confirmed as a tranny!! :]go rent this!!(i wouldn't pay $18 plus shipping and handling for this)"
5,A great Full Sail Movie,"I attend Full Sail, where this movie as filmed. It's an entire student production made for only $7k. We were very lucky to get WB to back this movie because it deserves it. I'm proud to say that my classmates helped make this great independent film and to look for more movies coming out of Full Sail. I garuntee the will be great quality such as this."
2,It's alright,"This book wasn't as helpful as I thought, the author had a few good ideas but as far as advice it was the same advice that you would get from any other person, she only bases the book through one perspective. This book is more for someone who is in a long distant relationship, I also felt like she wasn't in my shoes because she's happily married, I am a single mother and she talks about how lucky she is being married with children which made me feel even worse."
3,Not convinced it is MIU,"I just received this and have not used it yet but nowhere on it does it say MIU and it has a ""made in China"" tag. Construction may be ok but certainly isn't as good as my other MIU products. Convince me it is MIU Amazon."
3,Nice but...,"It is nice that it is so easy to clean and even looks nice. HOWEVER, the britles seem flip and flop around a lot causing a lot of splashing. Maybe the silicone bristles are too short or light. Not a problem if using outside on the grill but, if you are inside watch out for splashes."
5,THIS WORKS!!!,"Other silicon brushes I have tried don't hold liquid very well to brush or glaze with, it just slides off, but this one does! The end of each ""bristle"" has a teeny-tiny little silicon ball, so the brush retains glaze and liquids much better than most.After brushing bread with olive oil for garlic toast I simply blasted it with very hot water as I massaged in a little dishsoap, rinsed and hung back up -- SOOO much better than natural bristles which are impossible to clean."
2,The story was finished yet the book went on forever.,Got the Kindle edition.....premise was promising......reviews were pretty good. But the author should have popped for spellcheck or maybe even a proofreader. Pages and pages of babbling on and on and saying nothing. Pretty sure I won't be buying anything more from this author.
4,I'm not much for ghost stories,"But this one was fun. Not what I would call a 'horror' type of ghost, but more of a mystery. Although some was predictable, a lot was not and the action moves right along. I don't know if this is possible, but a sort of ghost cosy? Yet there's plenty of gruesome action and some excellent visuals. All in all, its fun to get a good book for 99c."
3,Jazz/rock fusion,"Here is Larry at his most rockin', playing with a trio and playing LOUD. Am I the only one who finds ""The Opening"" reminiscent of ""Who Knows"" from the ""Band of Gypsys"" album? Like many of Larry's efforts during this era, the playing can sometimes be a little sloppy, the singing ain't the greatest, but overall, there's a great feel to the whole affair. This is not pleasant, unobtrusive background music. This is music that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go. For all it's flaws, this is still a highly enjoyable album."
1,Disappointing,"I'm a longtime fan of They Might Be Giants and have loved every album they've put out, until this one. Mink Car is just plain bad. Three or four tracks, like the opening cut ""Bang"" are passable songs in TMBG's familiar style, but most of the tracks are virtually unlistenable. Typical example: ""Drink!"" in the hands of TMBG, ought to be a witty, eccentric parody of drinking songs. Instead, it's just a really lame drinking song. There's no humor, no spirit, not even a good melody. It sounds like John & John weren't having any fun when they wrote and recorded ""Mink Car."" There sure isn't much fun to be had in listening to it. I can only hope they do better next time."
2,Damaged in Shipping,I ordered two Toni home perms. They were not packaged well enough to protect the bottles inside the boxes. One of the bottles was cracked and the solution had leaked.
3,Good advice that can be too harsh at times.,"I enjoyed this book, but I am writing this review to warn some of you that this probably shouldn't be the first book you read after a tough break-up or divorce. The first section of the book is sometimes harsh and negitive about the value of love and it's importance in your life. Most things said are very true, but it sometimes comes across blunt and a hard manner to absorb if you are still very emotionally tender, or rather depressed. I would recommend a more light/positive book first, such as ""Mars And Venus: Starting Over."" Again, it's a good book, the case studies are very helpful but it may be a little hard for some of us who have seen our significant other just walk out the door. Hope this helps, but then again it's just my two cents!"
2,Doing less with more...,"The good part about this book is at least you get a historical reference, timeline and summary of major press releases. This book is poorly written and lacks any opinion, insight or true understanding of the issues facing the telecom industry. But at least is was first to market."
4,Brief response to Leah,"In a highly readable form, this book very well presents the facts concerning stalking. It would have benefitted from a decent editor (for example, to get rid of inappropriate use of subjunctive, change ""led"" for ""lead,"") but overall, I recommend it strongly.Leah complains that another reviewer mistakenly stated that Tim, Dr. Orion's husband, was her supervisor. It is Leah who is mistaken: on page 102, she explicitly states that they met when he was her resident supervisor and she a medical student."
3,Little Things,"Overall, I like the way this looks on my screen porch. The blades are not quite as dark of a mahogany as they are in the pictures. They are made of heavy plastic and the backs of the blades are not painted to match (ugly yellow). If you are placing this fan where you will be able to see the tops of the blades from somewhere, it would destroy the look you were after.My only other issue is that the paint is very tender and the primer beneath is a different color (ugly yellow again) so you have to be very careful when installing. For the money, I feel this was a good purchase and would buy the same fan again."
3,"""Fan""tastic","I bought two of these fans to use in our sunroom. Unique blade design and cool color is what sold me. Assembly was a snap, easy to hang. I found after I installed them they tend to wobble. It seems worse at lower speeds. Tried rearranging the blades etc. one still wobbles."
5,Excellent heart tonic,"This is an excellent tonic for strengthening the heart muscle. I know someone who was taking congestive heart medication and he began replacing it with this several years ago, and now he is fully off of the congestive heart medication and takes this instead. Naturally one should see a cardiologist for any changes in medications, but he credits this herbal supplement as the turning factor in his heart's health. I take it for strengthening of my heart as well. I like Nature's Way because the company has a good reputation for producing quality nutritional supplements. It's also competitively priced while providing a quality product."
5,A cinematic triumph!,"This is the rarest of all modern films, a MOTION PICTURE. It tells its story in image and facial expression, not in words. There is little dialogue; what sounds we hear are mostly music (the form of communication between the two leads) and ambient sounds, such as street noises.This is another rare film in which the viewer (this viewer, anyway) can't imagine anyone else playing the leads. Newton (as Shandurai) and Thewlis (as Mr. Kinsky) fit into their roles so well, you believe them completely. There is never a false move in the entire film. Their growing relationship is defined largely by Kinsky's successful attempts to communicate with Shandurai with his piano, his most beloved possession.The film explores motivation and honesty in an entirely new and refreshing way, leaving the viewer riveted to the screen, never taking the easy way out. What happens at the end? I'd like to think I know what will happen, but Bertolucci leaves it open-ended."
2,Sharp looking belt but not durable......,"This reversible belt is very good looking, at a good price, and versatile because of its 2 colors. However, its does not age well because it is very stiff. Within a couple of months of wear, I have noticed cracks at the belt hole where the buckle pin goes through it. The belt then becomes unsightly and needs to be replaced.Since buying this belt for a second time and having the same problem, I have purchased another brand of belt as a replacement."
2,good but...,leather belt is good but the buckle is junk. pulled apart at the swivel on 2nd use. didn't bother to replace it. just returned it. amazon was good about refunding . I just ordered a different one which worked out fine.
4,A must-have for every volleyball player,"""Peak conditioning training for volleyball"" by Thomas Emma is a book that you just can't do without, especially when you begin your adventure with volleyball. It guides you through all phases of volleyball conditioning training. Warm-up excercises are great - I do them before every physical activity thinking ""how could I do without them"". Conditioning excercises are not new, most probably every gym coach would show you them, but the book gives the systematic approach and I can definitely recommend it."
4,Not bad but animation quality could be improved,"This is a pretty decent series however the quality of the animation is a letdown. The characters are interesting and the concept is well thought out. The episodes have a cliffhanger format which makes them feel short. Overall, its far from being the best vampire themed anime but its still entertaining."
4,Good for people who like vampire stories,This was a great movie if you like anime and vampires. The plot was really good and had lots of twists. My favorite character was Mimiko. She was nice. Jiro's little brother was cute and funny. The animation was moderately good but the characters' costumes were really unusual.
2,Boring,"Those of us old enough to remember Speed Racer know just how bad badly done anime can be. I love animation but anime is a different breed of animal and I just don't see the point. Black Blood Brothers is about 2 brothers who are Black Bloods, there are also Red Bloods, as well as, Kowloon Children, a 3rd type of vampire.The music and grapics are extremely well done, thus the 2 stars. What I did take away from the series was a sense of a caste system, even in the vampire world. You have the old school vamps who seem to be revered, they are the Black Bloods, you have the newer group of vamps who are the Red Bloods and you have the Kowloon Children who are feared, despised, and avoided. What I didn't care for was not really understanding what was happening, even at the end of the first disc. It is obvious that the story is going to unwind slowly over the course of several discs, but this makes it hard to follow. The storyline left much to be desired also.All-in-all, this was a waste of time."
2,Derivative and mediocre,"BLACK BLOOD BROTHERS, CHAPTER 1 is the definition of ""average."" If you're an anime fan who will try anything once, you may get some enjoyment out of it; everyone else might as well give it a miss.First, the story: there's not an original thing in it. If you've watched HELSING, TRINITY BLOOD, and TRIGUN, and are also familiar with BLADE and ANGEL, there's probably not a thing here that's going to feel original. Overpowered heroes, chibi kids, girly girls, talks about vampire ""bloodlines,"" nonsensical fight scenes ... you name it. Typical anime, and terribly unimpressive.The animation is nothing to write home about, either. It's not awful, but it doesn't bring anything new to the table. Character designs are uninspired--a long-haired hero in a red trenchcoat, how avant-garde! It's basic studio-churned animation that, again, we've seen 100 times before.I doubt I'll ever seek out Chapter 2 of this series."
2,Dont think the box has anything to do with the movie.,"I read the reviews for this movie and really wanted to see it. Peter Greene is what caught my attention because he is a great actor just never made it as big as he should of. Well after I watched this movie I was extremely dissappointed. It didnt seem like the same movie everyone was reviewing PLUS! everything on the pictures on the front and back of the box IS NOT IN THE MOVIE! The picture of Johnny on the back holding the gun, yeah that never happends, nor is Peter Greenes character the way he is on the cover. I dont understand why they would put all that on the box and not have any of it in the movie."
3,"Playful music,which cheers you up!","Good points:the instrumental part is amazing,especially""Icek w Kolomej"". Bad points:the voices are awful."
5,The best C++Builder book for DB and Distributed Develoment,"The featured book `C++Builder 6 Developers Guide' is a criticalundertaking by Mr. Satya Sai Kolachina, who seems to have a thorough understanding of the C++ language and the C++ Builder product. The author has put his views in a no-nonsense style, in a way to make the book useful for every level of programmer, from beginner to the experienced. However, the readers should have some minimum knowledge of the C++ language or any other object-oriented language, as assumed by the author. As a newcomer to C++Builder, I have a very comfortable ride over the book and it helped me understand a number of new concepts supported by C++Builder. The example projects provided by the author are a very helpful in understanding C++ builder features."
2,Stick with Borland's Development Guide,This is not the book to buy on the subject of C++ Builder 6. Save your money on this one and go with Borland's development guide on C++ Builder 6.
1,lazy storytelling,"There are so many interesting adventures George could have had in a museum, but the authors decided on a worthless plot. George is at a science museum on a class trip with children. The teacher is trying to teach them about rocks and minerals, and the children are all whining about how boring it is. George runs away from the group and climbs all over the skeleton of a dinosaur in a nearby room. He is scolded by a member of the museum staff (as right he should be!!!) but then the class catches up with him and the children are interested in the dinosaur bones. The story suggests that the only reason they are interested is because George is climbing on it! The teacher is grateful that George has found something better to look at than the dull rocks and the museum staff, glad that the children have been spared their boring museum, readily forgive George and hail him as a hero. What a bunch of bologna!!!"
2,Bits & pieces,"My 5-year old was very excited to receive this toy for his birthday. However, the pieces come apart too easily, and are hard (especially for him) to put back together. The crash dummy is hard to fit into his seat. My son received this toy a few weeks ago, and already rarely plays with it. Most of the time it is in pieces in his toy box."
1,WASTED MY MONEY!!!!,I brought 5 bottles for the AutoDry machine. I used only 3-4 times and it doesn't clean as good as it advertised!!! WHAT A WAST OF MONEY!!!
4,for her first book.. not bad,"To keep it simple:This book is a simple but very entertaining read.It really keeps you reading because you're just DYING to try and decipher who's who in this 'fictional' world.It's a nice insider perspective into the world of the celebrity.If you like Nicole Richie, or if you're interested in the fabulous life, you'll most definitely like this book."
2,Easy Read,"The Truth About Diamonds was a very easy read, and even though Nicole Richie says the book is fiction, I'm sure the ""ideas"" for most of the elements in her book came from true life events which is what makes the book interesting. I think the main character Chloe switches between events that happened in Nicole's, Paris Hilton's and Kimberly Stuart's real life, even though Nicole has denied these claims.The overall story line of the book doesn't pack much meat behind it. It's just another rich girl story who has a famous father and doesn't do much of anything besides, shop, go to clubs and do drugs. I would skip reading the 226 page book and just watch a few episodes of The Simple Life and you'll be all caught up with Nicole and Paris Hilton's life. Even though I like Nicole, she definetly shouldn't give up her day job (shopping?) to be a writer."
2,Pretty much what you would expect ...,"Fairly decent concept and storyline, some major writing flaws, the occasional clever analogy or turn of phrase ... Nicole is adorable, but a writer she's not. Yet, anyway. With a bit of study and a better editor (i.e. one who actually cares a little more about the book and a little less about exploiting fame for money) she could possibly turn out a decent beach read. My biggest complaint is the insertion of herself into the plot as the good-head-on-her-shoulders friend - a technique that could have been interesting but just felt self-indulgent."
2,Ok,"This story is based on her life, it was interesting while reading it but looking back at it, it was kind of lame. I guess its just like every other celeb book.."
2,ummm... huh?,"I bought this book based on the past reviews stating that she dishes out a lot of dirt and whatnot. However I didn't see anything remotely close to dirt in this. It was a mixture of ""her side of the story"" and the view of a third person. I really didn't even understand who the names of the people were supposed to be in reality. I thought she put in good effort... but to me this book just seemed like someone trying to get extra money while putting in 2 weeks to write this book. I really wish I would have bought something more juicy. The ending was predictable even though it is based on her life story."
4,Far Exceeded My Expectations,"The Truth About Diamonds by Nicole Richie was a novel I heard about while watching Late Night tv. Nicole Richie was interviewed and she talked about her book. It sounded interesting, but I didn't know what to expect from a celebrity writing fiction. However, I was pleantly surprised by this novel. The novel is told from Nicole Richie's POV about her good (fictional) friend Chloe Parker who shares much in common with Richie herself. Chloe navigates the world of celebrity, rehab, and love throughout the book to discover what is really important in life. The book is really interesting, you get to enter a world, that most of us will never see or experience so even if an event seems unlikely you get the feeling that when it comes to this world all bets are off. I really enjoyed the book and laughed out loud quite a bit. Overall I would give The Truth About Diamonds 4 and 1/2 stars. It's a book you should give a chance."
4,Very entertaining,"I really enjoyed this book - it seems as though Nicole is just trying to write what she knows, rather than give a dirty expose or attempting to make herself even more famous. If you are a fan of books like The Devil Wears Prada and other high-fashion, people-oriented novels, then give this one a try! I bet that you will enjoy it!"
2,Boring and badly written,"So I'm really not super picky about books, I like both light and heavy reads and knew this would be 'a day at the beach' type of book... but it's horrible. I've never written a bad book review until now. I hated the book mainly because I never had any attachment to characters or cared what happened to them... bad character development. Also, if the book is written from her voice, but she's also two characters... that confused me a bit and is a very bad way to tell a story. Overall there was nothing in the book that caught my attention. The story was boring. The characters are dull. The writing is really bad.Do not waste your money. One of the worst book I've ever read and I'm not even exaggerating at all.. it was that boring."
5,Great 3D Action Racing Game,"It is possible to get thru all the levels so you can pick any race or car you want but may take more than a day or two. You can get there faster by using the cheat codes. I love the Solid Granite Car effect, running down light poles and totallying out cop cars (major bonus points). Cheat codes are available at [...] if you want them. Halfwit Harry's car or the Pink Pulverizer are the easiest cars to drive. Carmageddon II is better but you need a 3D card to play it. Would like to have the full collection of this game!"
4,Easy to install and use,"I really love these security locks-- I haven't been using them long so I can't speak to long-term durability, but they've fit beautifully on the windows where I've installed them and I really like the look. Inconspicuous, but attractive. The locking mechanism moves easily (although not all the way in) and stops the window while the plate prevents damage."
2,Did not work with Traktor LE software,I got this over a year ago in hope of being able to make my own mixes. I could never get it to work right. The audio would always play with a crackle or feedback sound coming out of the speakers. I configured my audio inputs and outputs several different ways and could not solve the problem. I then emailed Numark and NEVER got a response. Finally downloaded the 20 day trial version of the CUE software and worked just fine but now I have to spend $250 or more to by the software. Not worth it in my opinion escpecially since I have no aspirations of becoming a DJ.
2,Not as good.,"With a good graphics engine, new commentary, and 3D boosted gameplay, everyone expects this to be great. But it really is not. It loses a lot without a Playstation controller, and playing with a keyboard is akward and sluggish. There is some good gameplay here, but it is all so bland. If you want some NFL Gameday, go buy yourself a PS1/PS2, but do not buy this."
3,good...,"this is simply material you buy to fill up the gaps of your design/art library. there are some really useful tips and step by step instructions to given filters for photoshop, illustrator, freehand, etc. the 2 cd's that come with it are old, outdated, useless stuff and only relevant for amateurs. if you respect yourself as a designer you wont care taking a look at such junk. long live D.I.Y. dunno... i thought i'd be impressed but i wasnt. a bit above average book with some nice little tricks that's all."
3,Not bad but where was the editor?,"A good book for the airplane and fairly well written. Unlike a number of thrillers, this one has some unique and interesting characters. Some errors of fact and continuity, however, reflect a negligent editor. For example, we are told that a just murdered person was 48 years old. Later we are told this person was 24 years old in 1963. This would imply the story is occurring in 1987 or, at the latest, 1988. Yet elsewhere the book proceeds as if it were the 1990s. For example, we are told that it has been over 20 years since the Vietnam war ended (a war which ended in 1975) and we are told that a Senator from Alaska has served for over 20 years since the 1970s. Errors such as these mar what otherwise can be an entertaining read."
2,"Attractive, but needs some work...","A nice looking unit, sounds fine, even has good stereo imaging if you are sitting within three feet of the unit, as reccommended in the manual.But the remote would do absolutely nothing towards controlling my Ipod. It would not change songs, forwards or back, would not pause, and did not turn the Ipod off when it turned off the iM600 . Nothing in the manual addressed whether or not the remote was intended to do these functions. But if not, why would they refer to it as a full-function remote?Is that why they say to sit within three feet, to reach the Ipod?I returned it to Future Shop the next day."
4,delivers at 1/2 the price,"Good product at less than 1/2 the price of comparable docking stations (like Bose). If you have an iPod, you won't regret having this!"
4,sooooo portable; big sound,"For some reason (and not paying real attention to the measurements), I thought this item would be skinnier and generally a bit smaller. But that said, it's really light, and really portable, and I've been using the hell out of it while helping someone move out and then in to a new apartment, not having a stereo set up and all. It does provide excellent sound, and the little remote is fantastic, and it really does everything I was looking for in an ipod speaker system. Turn the volume up past 20 and it really fills a room. It's about the size of a thick book, but not as heavy. The battery lasts a long time. I definitely recommend it."
3,Maybe Not For Non-Apple MP3s,"Note: This is a review of the Altec Lansing iM600 used with a non-Apple MP3 player through the Aux In line.I really wanted this purchase to work out. The reviews here have been very positive as to sound quality and after two trips to my local big box store, the sound seemed to be fairly good. The purchase from Amazon went smoothly.... the sound quality did not. Even with the stereo enhancement feature engaged, the sound in my kitchen was fairly flat with little stereo separation. Without the feature engaged, it was an even flatter, tinny sound. Perhaps this is related to plugging in through the Aux In line, because in the noisy store environment it really did sound pretty good, better than the Klipsch equivalent product. So this just did not work out for me. I'm happy to say that Amazon handled the return with no problems."
4,I like it!,"I enjoy the sound quality of this product, and its looks. The re-chargeable battery makes it easy to carry it around the house with you, and it's very light (about the weight of a book)...I recommend this product."
3,Excellent except for the FM receiver,The Altec Lansing in Motion iM600 iPod speaker system works very good. It sounds great and the controls are intuitive.Two things.1. MAJOR: The FM receiver does not work well. I can't pickup anything without wrapping the antenna in aluminum foil.2. MINOR: The charge receptacle is behind the folding panels. It should be in the side so I can charge it folded closed or open.
2,Pretty good sound but lacks functionality,"While this product at first seems slick with its foldaway stand, there are a few things it lacks.First, it's not compatible with iPhone 3G. A message comes up on the iPhone that says the device will not charge it. Had I known this one item, I would not have bought it.Second, the remote fits nicely into a slot when the stand is folded up - cool. Except that when the stand is unfolded the remote falls out. Not a big deal - I've found that a little square of adhesive velcro will hold it in.Third, there is _no_ acoustic bass when playing music. The highs and mid-ranges seem to be there, but very little bass.Bottom line; it's probably fine for a regular iPod if you just want to hear your music; a little pricey for a dorm room; I would not recommend it for enjoying music or for your iPhone."
2,Not very happy here,"Hey all -I'm not sure I get the positive reviews associated with this product. I guess it's not the worst thing I've ever bought but keep in mind a few things - FM reception seems very poor, in my area at least, compared to other radios. The buttons/switches are balky without a positive feel to them. Third, sound quality is mediocre in my opinion - granted it's a cheap plastic player, but man.... Last, if you're thinking about buying the accessory powered subwoofer (something that could potentially make a difference) - it's apparently no longer in production though it seemed to take AL customer service quite a while to figure that out. Overall, I'm not too thrilled. Probably won't pitch it in the trash, but maybe it'll go in the garage."
2,Needs reset button,"I bought this product based largely on the positive review by MacWorld. When it arrived it did not function. Following the manual, I removed the battery cover and unplugged the rechargeable battery to reset the controls. This worked, but then after one round trip with my laptop in a backpack in the car (not very adverse conditions), it did not work once again. The bigger problem with this is that the screws for the battery compartment are very small -- my not young eyes have trouble seeing them and a small jeweler's phillips screwdriver is needed -- and they are difficult to remove. Given this issue, Altec Lansing should have incorporated a reset button. I am disappointed. This product is not living up to its claimed portability."
5,Very good sound!,"I bought this unit after Consumer Reports recommended it as a great value. It's compatible with ipods only. This model is appropriate for an average size work station, cubicle etc. I carry it back and forth to work everyday and find the design to be sleek and portable. Sound quality is very good in my opinion, not too 'bassy' and not too 'tinny'. I don't feel that parts of the sound range are missing when I listen to my songs. I am not a sound expert, just someone who wants decent song playback at the office without spending $300-$400. This unit is well-balanced in quality and price. A great value!"
1,Don't waste your money if you have a nano,"I once swore by this product. I bought it for recreation and for work since I do massage and would bring it on client calls. The sound was great and was extremely portable.After a couple of months it stopped taking a charge through the wall adapter. So I bought a replacement. Strike one.The specs say it is compatible for the nano but it IS NOT. The nano is too small and light and so I had to always place some kind of prop to keep it pushed forward so the system would recognize it and would play. There is something that comes with the nano that is designed to alleviate this but unfortunately that didn't help either. Over months of this propping the ""motherboard"" on the system got ruined and now it won't play ipods since it ruined the connection. I am VERY dissapointed since this was a total waste of +$120 !"
2,No bass whatsoever,"I bought this product after reading the reviews. When I received it and connected my ipod to it, I was surprised with the sound, which sounded really tinny. I then played a song that starts with a bass line, and I discovered that the bass was not reproduced at all! The song only started playing when the other instruments started.It goes without saying that I returned it immediately for a refund. This may be acceptable to some people whose ears are not well trained to hearing music, but to me it is unacceptable. I used to have a Creative Playdock, and the sound was heaps better, to the point where you could use it outside for a party. This thing is not even good enough for a small room."
4,I love it,"Great sound quality, excellent price, longlasting battery charge. The remote control only handle the speaker system, not the ipod."
4,Nice little system for the size and price,"This is a nice compact, very portable system for your i-Pod. IMHO it can't compare to the rich sound of the Bose Soundock (which I also have) but for bringing onto your deck or patio during nice summer days and evenings, it can't be beat for the price. Highly recommended."
4,A historical overview with future research possibilties,"Any reader looking to learn more about the history behind interest group formation will appreciate this detailed, highly engaging book. The authors do an excellent job of laying out their ideas and backing up their opinions. What most impressed me about the book was the final chapter, where the authors went on to recommend ways political science researchers could achieve more coherence in the varied approaches to studying interest groups. This was a adept way to pull together the rest of the book and I only wish I was looking for a way to conduct research in this evolving field!"
5,Soon to become one of your new favorites!!,"I bought this box set as a gift. I, myself, have seen the show and find it to be quite funny! The person that received this gift just loved it! I have also purchased the other box sets from ATHF.My review for this will be short because there has been so much said here already. Take it for what it is. A cartoon show. I know it was shown on ""Adult swim"" but it's still a cartoon show. A funny one. But that's all.If you like to laugh. These sets are pretty much a must. It's a night of easy fun. Hope you all enjoy not only the uniqueness of the show, but the characters as well. You will want to see them all. (More than once)!"
2,A Little Disappointing :(,"I must admit I was a little disappointed with this book, although the detail paid to Todd's music, the musicians with whom he worked is very thorough, and I did enjoy the inclusion of the various magazine reviews of his albums when they were first released, but I hope a biography is going to give me some insight into the person's LIFE - his music I have available to listen to! There was hardly any personal detail about Todd, and he seems like such an interesting person. I was really hoping to hear more about his relationship with Patti Smith, another favourite of mine, but she was only mentioned briefly three times, and none of it was related to anything she and Todd did together! But I know everyone has different expectations of a music biography, and I'm sure there will be plenty of people who don't care about the personal stuff and will certainly find it very informative :)Jo Segarra"
1,I usually don't do this,I just wanted to find out more about Todd and his relationship with other musical groups in the 70s. the book is even hard to read with the dot matrix print etc. Terrible.
5,More than I expected!,The original Wolf Man and Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man were really the only reasons why I purchased this boxed set. The other movies were o.k.
5,The legacy collection that is a legacy,"This DVD set is the ultimate! From the beginning, I have always loved werewolves. And when I finally saw a movie that I had been looking for since I first got interested in werewolf films, I knew this was for me.As for the movie ""She-Wolf of London"", I had never heard of it. It is what's related to how Alfred Hitchcock got started--through conspiracy that resulted in horrifying incidents. In the end, though, I didn't like the plot once it was explained. I wanted a classic werewolf. Well, I guess I just didn't get that!All in all, though, I really enjoyed this collection. I especially appreciated learning about the fact that Larry Talbot went on even after ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman"". I hope you enjoy it, and happy howling!"
1,Not as shown!!! BEWARE,"What they send you is not what they are showing in the picture. Don't buy!! They send you a different tea strainer that is cheaper and not what is in the picture. Also, the vendor MV Trading will not respond to your emails regarding this unfair practice."
4,Gift for my father.,This item arrived intact and prior to promised date. Cannot comment on its content as it was a Christmas gift.
3,"Charming and spare, it's a picture of a life that's pure","It's pure, because the fears cataloged make sense for the author, and on some level, we all could list our fears the same way. However, for me, a single reading is all I gave it. Started getting a little repetitive. But again, it's inside the head of a unique guy who sees life much differently than I do.Enjoy it and pass it on."
5,Tastes great!!,"I really like the flavor but I don't have much choice anyways, not many pizza spices brands out there to buy. I used to buy McCourmick but they discontinued their pizza spices (I really loved their hot version). But I do like this pizza spice anyways. I just sprinkle on top of my pizza slice as I am eating it."
5,Good Purchase,I have used it for one three day camping trip and put it through the dishwasher twice. This set of silverware has worked very well. It is exactly as I had expected. It packs securely and I have had no problems with items falling out. I did find that it packs more compactly if I put the spoons and forks either end and reversed one of their curvatures (i.e. put them in turned over). This was definitely a good purchase.
3,"Don't buy, get the Coleman Max Flatware Set instead","For roughly the same price (maybe a dollar or two more) you can get the Coleman Max Flatware Set instead. It has a flap to cover the utensils from falling out, the utensils are better made, and the case is held closed by velcro instead of the strap. I had these first and then returned them when I found the Max. Just a much better product."
2,Mine also died!,"My F110 also failed after much less than 250 faxes. The tech support at Xerox thinks its the motherboard since it has power but does not go through a self check and give error codes. The MB costs $250. I might be able to do it myself and save another $200 labor costs, but I only paid $400 for the F110 and so its not worth it.Too bad, ehh. I loved this machine. Clean copies all the time, almost never jammed. Best fax I've seen. But dead is dead, so none of that gets any stars.Over all I've heard bad reviews about a lot of Xerox products. Their solid ink printer is said to eat ink every time you turn it on. And lots of other problems with it. I would advise to avoid Xerox products over all."
4,Fog Light Bulbs,Little loose on the install. Used RTV to make sure they seal. Seem like decent bulbs and they were priced well.
2,Did not work,"Program kept freezing up - had to return. It did seem fun, and will try to locate this game that will actually work."
5,FANTASTIC FUN,"I purchased this for my grandson for his 11th birthday. He absolutely loves it. Everytime I talk to him he says, ""Thank you, thank you, thank you"" for my birthday present.It is truly phenomonal. There are so many different adaptions that you can use with this game. He is very video game literate and I have never known him to be so excited about one before."
4,Good Buy,"Great deal at $5. Got bored one night and just bought it when I saw this deal at slickdeals. I had a good amount of fun with this game. It gets boring after a while so I don't recommend playing more then one or two career scenarios in a row. I got Tycoon in the first 5 for RCT3 in about 2days. I am running this game with Win 7. The graphics are much better compared to the first or second version of this game so i'm sure it requires some good graphics. I have a high-end system, so its no problem for me. Buy it and enjoy it if you can get a good price. I don't think i would pay more then $10."
2,Boring Game,"This game is old and boring. It has a lot of flaws and I wouldn't buy again. Otherwise, it had a good price tag on it."
1,VISTA = WON'T WORK,"Simple as this. If you have Windows Vista, it will not install. I just got this game off of Amazon.com and it won't even install. It freezes up My Computer when I try to explore/run/autorun the disc."
1,Vista owners beware,Does not work on Windows vista. Even after you go through all the fixes and such. Yes I know it is for XP and such but it is interesting that when you download the demo version that works fine but the actual game does not...
1,won't install,This game will not install on XP. It gets almost to the end of the installation then stops. Have tried multiple times without success. Atari has no support. The multiple patches for this game only work IF you can get it to install. I strongly do NOT recommend this problem (game).
5,Thermometer,This was purchased as a gift. So far the thermometer has worked fine and think that it should work fine for how much it will be used.
1,only if you live in a castle in the air,"not evidence based. Just his own imaginings. Appears to have severe problems with religion, but doesnt reveal that straightforwardly. This is neither psychology or philosophy. Clearly wants to be 'the discoverer' of something, yet the indigenous thought of many groups throughout the world are represetned in his work without credit. The author is out of touch. A psychology of our times is both psychological and biological, and not a self indulgent follower of Jung in the style of the mid-1900s. Nothing timeless here that does not derive from others far more organized and erudite."
3,"Not a Complete Reference, but nice to have !","I bought this book because I wanted to supplement my preparation for the Solaris 8 certification exams. I already had sysadmin experience with versions 2.5, 2.6 and 7.Solaris 8 - The Complete Reference is extremely readable and a good start for anyone who needs to look at the new Solaris version.ProsGood emphasis for PC based admins coming from an NT background, who need a grounding in Solaris and UNIX.Very, very readable.ConsNot very much real information on the boot processNot very much information on the security aspects of Solaris, just a few pages only.Way too much detail on on subjects like FTP (16 pages), which everyone should know anyway.Practically nothing on the use and setup of Jumpstart or diskless clients.Not enough detail on the real Solaris features such as volume management, and set/getfacl and the Openboot process.But overall.... I solidly recommend it to be on every small or big- time Solaris admins bookshelf."
2,MY Book fell apart,"This book is full of unnessesary printouts about 20% of the book is just printouts from the results of the commands you are told to run. Although I cant blame the author for this , my book fell apart at the spine (bad glue) Im going to try and get my moey back from the bookstore. Those of you who are already familiar with solaris dont even bother with this book- its a guide not a reference."
2,A beginners overview of Solaris,"I suppose that it would be helpful to folks that aren't currently familiar with Solaris, but with a title like ``The Complete Reference ...,'' I was hoping for something a little more, well, complete. There was absolutely nothing in this book that I did not already know by heart and little that couldn't be discovered by reading a few man pages. To be specific, there was little to no mention of the newish Solaris features like LDAP and DHCP clients.It's really more of a general Unix overview with a Solaris flavor. Definitely for the beginner to early intermediate."
4,Good for Solaris beginners,"I use Linux, but I buy this book two weeks ago when I wanted to run the Solaris program. It is really good (some commands are even the same). The English is easy to understand and there are good examples. Many problems solved in these pages. Best chapter is about devices - Solaris /dev is more difficult than Linux I think."
1,Incomplete Reference! Rating- (no stars),"I was looking for a good Solaris 8 reference, this is not it. I had the book 10 minutes, here's what I found. The first things I tried to look up in my new complete reference were the new Solaris 8 commands prstat, psinfo, and sdtprocess - nothing about them. How about a few words on the Solaris Product registry which is also new in Solaris 8 for managing software pkgs- nothing. Page 253 shows a script that can be used for unmounting a busy file system- hey, what about the new Solaris 8 umount -f option for unmounting busy file systems- nothing about it. I could go on and on about stuff missing in this book, but I think you get the point. Did they even look at Solaris 8 before writing this book. It appears the publisher was more concerned with getting a book out first than a ""real"" complete Solaris 8 guide. Oh, and BTW- mine's falling apart too. Mine's going back."
5,Why Grand Funk Railroad Ruled,"You want to know why the PEOPLE loved GFR - watch the DVD. The critics panned them so much - and why? They were truly the American Band - quintessentially the best garage band. On the DVD - ""Inside Looking Out"" ALONE is worth the price... then add the amazing ""I'm Your Captain"" at Shea Stadium (where, by the way, they outsold the BEATLES) and you've got some amazing memories RIGHT HERE. I was blessed enough to have seen the 3 Amigos twice in the day.... this just brings it all back. If I were to have any negative comment, it would be that Capitol could have incuded MORE."
5,Very happy,I'm very please with the DVD collection I bought from Amazon. It arrived promptly and was everything I hoped it would be!
2,Great Collection - Cheap Quality Discs,"Note to Universal: NO MORE FLIP DVDs! I've gone through four sets and have finally given up. These movies are wonderful, but good luck finding a copy that isn't scratched up. Because of the way this set is packaged, you have a zero percent chance of getting DVDs that aren't ""floating"" around in their cases. As a result, the DVDs always arrive damaged. These cheaply produced DVDs are also formatted on both sides (you have to ""flip"" them like a record in order to play both sides). The menus are also poorly designed, so you'll be flipping quite a bit just to find the movie you want to see. These films deserve better treatment than this. What's up Universal?"
2,A neutered pack of classics..,"Ahh. Some great games from my childhood. But.. some of the games lack network multiplayer play. I mean, the option is there, but it isn't clickable. Its the same on all of the computers in my house. And the network works fine with every other games. And I seem to remember testing it at a friend's house with the same result.. This could be an isolated problem, but I doubt it. But, hey. If you're willing to waste money.. My copy could just be a dud."
2,not good for headset use,"The problem with this unit is that we wanted to use a headset/earpiece with the phone, using the 2.5 mm jack. The volume was too low to be useable, couldnt adjust it. We had to return it. If you dont need that feature, it worked fine."
4,Vantec Nextars 3 NST-360SU Review,"This is a terrific enclosure. The unit is quiet, the heat dissipates quuickly, looks great. Overall the unit is a terrific enclosure for a real bargain price."
2,"Looks cool, but runs hot","The performance of this fanless enclosure is great. But with 750 GB seagate SATA drives, it just runs way too hot. It could act as a good heater in the winter, if you don't mind about your drives dying prematurely.I had a defective enclosure on which the enclosure activity light only came on for the USB , but not for the eSata interface. I had to get it replaced.The eSata cables are too short. This may be due to the eSata specification. Too bad, since the eSata runs almost twice as fast as USB 2.0.IMO, it is only acceptable to use this enclosure for limited periods of time for backups. Don't leave this on 24/7."
3,"Good school, great team, so-so book","This was a light, fast, enjoyable read, but in the end, my pleasure stemmed from the subject moreso than the author's skill. Having read many of John Feinstein's works, I was expecting an ""inside"" look at the Gonzaga program: the story of a season through the eyes and words of players and coaches. Instead, Mr. Withers cobbles together a series of brief histories: of the school, of the coaching staff, of the team, of the WCC, etc. Although there are interviews with coaches, players and recruits, it seemed as though Withers spent most of his time compiling and recounting articles from newspaper achieves and school promotional literature.If you like college hoops, and have enjoyed Gonzaga's seeminingly improbable success in recent NCAA tournaments, then you'll enjoy this book. If, however, you want to know what it's like to be a student-athlete or coach campaigning towards the ""big dance"" next March, this book doesn't deliver."
3,Quite a Good First Effort,"This isn't a bad book, and is quite good for a first effort from this author. It certainly isn't your normal romance story, and there is a definite feeling of hope that comes through. It is a story about two very strong-willed people and how they clashed at first, and then found out that they complimented each other. It's also a good view of the Jehovah Witness faith, and let's face it, there's not many books about that. The writing is good, and the story moves along nicely. I liked these characters and I think you will too."
4,Well done,"I was left feeling cheated and sad by this well written 2nd novel of Thayer's. However, I too found it so similar to George Eliot's Silas Marner, that I wondered how it was possible that Cynthia Thayer, or the publisher: St. Martin's Griffin, didn't make any mention of that anywhere. Still, I found this novel does justice to the harshness of living on the remote Maine coast, evoking sounds and sights, and even smells to mind that coincide with the mood of the main character - Peter. The deep sadness and strangeness of the characters, their awkwardness towards each other, their bonds, the caring for their neighbors, is all written of in true fashion.Btw: it is widely available at libraries, if you don't want to buy it or can't afford to."
5,Cumbia meets jazz,"I can't describe the music on thsi cd other then cumbia meets jazz. There are touches of salsa, son montuno, and other tropical styles. the music sounds Cuban with touches of Colombia cumbia. But the music is de Colombia. Red hot latin dance music that sounds liek it was recorded in teh late 1950's. Great stuff, lot's of improvisation, and a real tight band, muy tropical!!!"
3,appointment with fear,"Appointment with fear is not a great movie but it brings back the 80s like they were here yesterday. Deborah Voorhees makes the movie a ""must see"", what a body and face. I love the politically incorrect line in the movie ""lets give the bum a ride"", speaking about a down and out homeless man. Loved it!"
3,NOT AS EXPECTED,THE MATS WERE NOT AS HEAVY DUTY AS I EXPECTED. WEATHER TECH MATS MUCH BETTER. SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED AS MUCH FOR THE PRICE. WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN.
3,Ugh smell!,I picked these because some reviewers said they did not smell.. most of the other ones said there was a smell. Overpowering STRONG smell of.. mothballs is what it smells like to me.I rushed them out of the house and hosed them off.. didn't help. Will have to leave them outside.Color is gray and they look good but not usable until this wears off.
3,Car floor mat.,It has a good appearance and the rubber seems a lot softer than the other mats that I used.It is too soon to say how it will perform with time.The price is reasonable.
1,Another name for chile powder?,"If you looked up chile powder in a thesaurus, it might just say ""Chef Paul Prudhomme's Magic Seasoning Blends Magic Salt Free Seasoning"". After paying shipping, it was, by far, the most expensive chile powder I've ever purchased."
1,"Pretty graphics, wretched game","I had fun in Everquest, for a little while. I could list the things I hated about this game, but I'm going to save the energy. One thing I must mention is that the gameplay is crap. The game progresses terribly slow and worst of all it doesnt progress anywhere in particular, just up. Up another level, up another level, up another level. Its about as much fun as climbing a ladder."
4,"Good product, Description lacking","Good product, great price, free shipping. Picture does not match what was sent. Bought this for a small SUV. Way to big. They are for full size Trucks and Vans.Ended up putting them in my full size pickup. Product description does not mention any dimensions or what kind of vehicles they will fit in."
1,Don't watch it. Just watch the making of.,This reminded me of an afterschool special. You'll apologize to your friends I know I did. But watch the making of featurette.
3,Correction,"In response to the below comment to my book review - I did not have an ""out of print"" of older edition of the book.Generally, the book presents an average overview of offender profiling. However, the Editors give credit to the FBI in several passages for the rape model, power assertive, anger retaliatory, etc, but it was in fact Prentky and Knight who first developed this type of rape classification scheme. Also, the book claims to represent researchers' opinions from all around the world on 'profiling,' however, the fact is, there is not one American author in the book.Maurice Godwin PhD --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."
2,"For the love of god, buy something else.","This has to be the most uncomfortable super nintendo controller I've ever used. The cord is short, the Buttons are spongy and have to be pushed down so hard that it legitimately hurts. The DPAD is probably the only semi-tolerable thing on the controller, and even then that's pushing it. The turbo and slow functions DO work, but it's not worth them in the end. If you're going to get a 3rd party super NES controller, get yourself a SuperPad or a fighter stick SN. The superpad feels just as good as a normal SNES controller and the fighter stick is one of the best arcade controllers I've ever used."
1,On the wrong planet,"I watched this movie as I thought I would learn someting (like I did with so many other massage videos).This one was absolutely terrible and is NOT worth the money at all.I am not actually sure what this technique is but it is not Tui Na. I have done several semesters of study of Acupuncture and Acupressure but this is not useful at all, not even for a student.The movie was very poorly presented by the massage therapist blocking the view on occasions when doing work on the head plus the moderator appears to have problems speaking. His voice is so forced and makes it an unpleasant experience overall.Very disappointed and would not recommend this video to anyone."
2,BORRRRRR-ing!!!!,"This volume just wasn't what I was looking for -- that is, an easily graspable story of the history of Britain and Ireland. Perhaps this says more about me than about the author's skill, but I chose this book for enjoyment rather than research, and found the work too dry to sustain my interest.What I'd like to see is a history of the people of the Isles, their music, their entertainment, their religious beliefs, their daily lives and how they changed through history. 'The Isles' is hundreds of pages of arguing whether the Saxons should really be referred to as Saxons, what the pre-Celts might have called their island home (why bother?), and a drudging list of heads-of-state through the centuries. I'm no judge of Davies' accuracy, but I know a good read. This was painful for an average Joe."
3,worked great--until it broke,"We purchased the D40 kit just over a year ago. I have been thrilled with the camera and lenses it came with. Until--I was shooting pictures of the kids and the lens locked up for no apparent reason. Turns out the lens is pretty much shot (we think the motor in the lens went bad) so we have no choice but to buy a new one. The Nikor lenses come with a five year guarantee, IF YOU RETURN THE CARD WITHIN 10 DAYS OF PURCHASE. Unfortunately we just realized this so no luck with the warranty. I recommend everyone returning the lens warranty card in case this happens to you. Other than that this has been a great camera."
3,Decent game,"This game is pretty decent. It's a little different than most Diablo clones, you can play it with a controller. You get combos as you level up. It's a little buggy, I don't think it jives with Windows XP. I reinstalled windows because while trying to get the video to work right, I corrupted stuff. It turns out all I had to do was click off the ""slow gameplay"" button in the options. It made the menus and the game stutter like crazy with it on. With it off the game ran a little too fast, but it was tolerable. Kinda crappy graphics, but its an interesting game."
4,"People who ditch this game, stop whinning...","Yeah there are a few annoying things with this game, and it's old now but I mean this is one of the few games got me sat in my chair for 2 days trying to beat it. Well it's a lot more fun than stragety games which I've been playing, heh But overall I think they did a good job with story telling, graphics, and I can't give anything to sound, coz the sound was messed up for me (still I played *grins* )Now this is something I should whine, this game is quite buggy and Eidos knows people still love this game and should make a better patch for it especially to make run more stable in XP anywayz. I don't know about other people, but this game crashed left and right the moment I installed it. (still it didn't stop me from playing, hehe)You all should be happy that you beat it and saw the ending because this game crashed on me forever and I only need to kill one more guy to finish the game.... grrahahahah *pulls hair out*... Merry xmas anywayz..."
2,Great playing for such a bad story,"This game plays wonderfully. The movement, graphics and fighting are very well done. The problem is just that the games plotline was terriblly designed. I had so much money and so many potions by the end that there was no way that I could possibly lose. The game is so short it is hard to call it a real RPG. It only took me ten hours or so to beat. Each time you meet a new enemy the game becomes challangeing for about three or four minutes before you figure out how to beat that creauture. The magic is well done graphicly and the healing and invisibilty spells are somewhat usefull, but not nessesarry to winning. The offensive spells are just useless. They are hard to cast and don't cause enough damage to warent their use. If the people who created this game had taken just a little bit longer to make the game longer and more challengeing this game would really be worth having."
4,Lots of Action,"This book is all over the place, and downtime is rare. It starts with a group of Mantis Warriors being overrun in such detail that my heart rate increased. From there, the book jumps from battle to battle, with occasional breaks to advance the story.The plot is a little vague, and I was most of the way through the book before I figured out what was going on."
2,Pitiable,"If war is atually anything like what the game shows, it really is hell, even if you don't get hit once. For a game that seems to be aimed specifically at strategic combat, Braveheart seems to have surprisingly little strategy: everything frequently turns into random skirmishes, and one who has most troops will win. Your troops can barely see past their noses, and this makes ranged weaponry all but useless.For the management part: one phrase - no standing orders. You will have to click, and reclick, and reclick each command each and every turn if you want something done continuously. And almost everything demands attention: your countless armies, towns, villages, settlements, spies, harvests, you have to tell each one of them what to do every turn of the game.Braveheart is a good game turn bad, so bad it hurts to see it."
5,very happy customer,I was very impressed with how product was wrapped and was sent in very timely manner. Thank you .
5,This stick was made for walking,"Well-crafted and very durable. All one needs is bag of apple seeds and you can trod this land from the New York island to the sparkling sands of the diamond desert. Seriously - though most of my walks are on level roads, and a staff is most useful when walking over broken ground or climbing a steep incline - I love it! If you don't need a staff to stabilize your gait, you can get an upper body workout by practicing staff Katas, or drum-major routines."
3,"Good smell, but not-long lasting","I LOVE the smell of this perfume. It's very warm and somewhat spicy, a sexy perfume. The downside is though its strong when first put it on, it dies down soon after and practically vanishes before too long. Good price though"
2,Really? It didn't work for me.,"It's been a while since I read this book. But I don't recall it doing me any good, and I'm not using the technique still. It had a slight New Age flavor to it. I'm sure there is some valid scientific research on it though. But overall, it is just another self help book about some technique that you will stop doing and then forget about. And the grammar and typo errors mentioned by others are quite distracting.The audio CD it comes with wasn't that good. I like a good jazz song, but I would call the music on this, ""Crazy jazz"". That is, a lot of synthetic instruments played in a fast manner. Which I don't find relaxing or engaging at all.So maybe you'll get something out of it, or like the music. But four years after I've read it, it is just that weird brain book with the weird jazz CD for me."
2,Wack!!,"As for the seller...no complaints. Shipping was on point. As for the dvd...an upset! Although it had a few parts where I laughed out loud, this was a waste of money. My husband and I are usually into the stupid funny movies, but this was just stupid. Don't waste your money!"
1,"Good idea, poorly implemented","Needs line of sight from no more than 8 feet away to work -- the major deal breaker for me. Software sprays files into non-Apple recommended places and there's no uninstall. Tiny screen, hard to read. Replaced the Hercules with a Keyspan TuneView which does everything the Hercules promised to do.Update: bought an iPod Touch w/ v2.0 firmware. I now use the ""Remote"" application which is, IMO, the killer app for the Touch/iPhone. There is no better remote; got rid of the Keyspan."
4,Weird but Cool,"If your kids love garbage trucks, check out this outdated but kid-friendly dvd. The main character is a little annoying (to me, an adult), but my kids dig it. The second episode about semi-trucks is semi-interesting. However, the first episode on garbage and recycling, is excellent and educational. Great for teachers, too."
2,Unix for people who already know Unix...,"Dave Taylor and Brian Jepson, please take a pedagogy pill and call me in the morning... Sheesh, could they have made this any more obtuse? Purchase this book if you have a lot of time on your hands and/or enjoy learning things despite the best efforts of the author. To paraphrase Churchill: ""Never have two guys taken so long to explain so little."""
4,Small garbage can,"I gave it 4-stars instead of 5 because my wife says it is a little too small. I think it is fine. You will have to empty your trash a bit more, just know that going in. But is holds the plastic bags very well, is easy to clean out, the foot-lever actually works (a rarity it seems), and is aesthetically pleasing."
1,"Do not buy , product is not worth the cost and shipping.",Jacobs Creme crackersTerrible product not worth the cost. The advertising for the product is very misleading. Furthermore it takes too long to get this product. There is nothing about these crackers that are Creme. THEY ARE VERY HARD.
1,Where did all the money go?,Where to begin? How about...not fun. Bad graphics+bad gameplay+bad sound+no replay value=bad game. The saddest part is that Eidos put so much money into this game that good studios (i.e. Looking Glass) ended up shutting down. Quake II is still more fun than this! They should have pulled the plug on Ion Storm a long time ago.
2,Decent,The large stylus is pretty cool and is more comfortable than the small stylus.The small stylus makes your DS lopsided when you put it in the DS and bends too easily....
2,Stylus Breakdown,"Whenever we look at the Nintendo DS Lite, we always try to look for those extra stylus pens for just such an time when we lose them. Sadly, third-party companies have made so many version of stylus pens, but they all have missed the mark. This Nyko Pro Point Pack, takes on their takes on what a cool stylus should be like for the DS. While the look is nice, with each one of the stylus pens having a LED light, it still lags in functioning after only a few uses. If you are going to get a replacement stylus for the Nintnedo DS, make sure it is only from Nintendo, and not from a company that really misses the point.Price: DControl: D+Overall: D"
4,Seems to be working!,"We have tried every wart removal method possible over the last 4 years. We have had them lasered off, frozen off, duct-taped, everything. This product seems to be shrinking the warts! We have been putting it on for about 2 months, morning and night, and we are seeing good results. It is really exciting for my 11 year old."
3,OK for younger ones.,"I recieved this in good working order and was as advertised. I think it would be good for the younger campers, scouting age, and that general group of out door activities. But for those of us older use to normal sized utensils, I found both fork and spoon to be a bit small."
2,Not very impressed,"I think I know why the pic of this item is on a maniquinn, not a person - the cut isn't actually very flattering to women. Corsets are supposed to narrow your waist and increase your bust, but this one did the exact opposite. It seemed to push my chest down rather than up, and my waist (which is fairly average in size) looked almost wide. It's only redeeming quality is the lace up back, which is very sexy. I bought two corsets at the same time, and my boyfriend much preferred the other one I bought over this one. Save your $ for a different corset."
2,Second rate Ani!,"I was looking forward to hearing this CD after a friend raved constantly about it. After listening to it, I was totally disappointed. She sounds just like Ani Difranco! So much so if I was Ani I'd call her and tell her to get her own damn sound! If you aren't a fan or never heard of Difranco, you'll love this CD! You will love it as much as those of us loved Ani when we first discovered her. But, she's not Ani, not even close!"
1,What a waste,Visions of Sugar PlumsKept hoping it would get better but it never did.The plot is contrived and the acting is terrible at best.
1,Yikes! I've seen elementary sch...,"I've seen elementary school productions that had better, more authentic emotional content/context than this movie contains.Stilted, stiff, lacking in a basic connection to the characters, the actors come off as if they are simply and badly reading from a script. They sound as though this is the first ""table reading"" session for them. It was painful to watch, so I just stopped and exited."
2,known QC issues,"i bought this tv in 2005 from best buy. it worked fine at first, although it's big and bulky. but approximately six weeks after the extended warranty i purchased expired, the tv all of a sudden wouldn't power up. nothing. the green light just blinked on and off. i unplugged the power cord, waited about a 1/2 hour and tried again. this time a high-pitched whine came out of it, informing me that it was fried. i then went online to epinions (dot) com and found some reviews of the product. apparently, this happened to 9 out of 13 people -- a fairly high ratio -- some within six months. i then talked to the rca customer service rep, who denied this was a known issue with this tv. as if! if you get one, make sure you have an extended warranty because it can go at any moment, without warning. better yet, avoid RCA products altogether unless they get their QC together."
1,Fake product!,"The bottle looks genuine except for the cap, but shampoo inside looks and smells completely unlike the real American Crew product. And it wasn't any good."
1,Rip off,"The shampoo in the bottle is NOT American Crew. After closer inspection, the caps on the bottles I ordered are not the same packaging that American Crew uses. BEWARE!!!"
1,Late delivery,"Once again an Internet business uses deception tactics for delivery times. The item said at the time of purchase, ships in 2 to 3 days, 15 days later I still have not received the item."
1,"Football player, Indiana","This game is probably a good one, but I have bought 2-3 games from 989 sports and none have them have worked correctly, where others have. We checked out our station, and everything is o.k., I tried to go to 989 sports, and Redzone with no success. Has anyone had this problem? My sons have to save up to buy these C.D.'s and after several problems, not only do I have to listen to the dissapointments, whining, etc., I get upset having to spend my money on games that don't work. I would take them back to the store that I bought them from, but I can't, once they're open. How do you know they work if you don't open them and try them? I think we need to make sure these games work before releasing them."
5,Gameday Rocks Head to Head,"Gameday Football is by far the best football game ever when it comes to playing head to head with another human. It dogs madden! Madden AI is better when playing the computer. If you buy a game just to play the computer , buy Madden..But if you like to play real people, Buy GAMEDAY!"
2,Just another game!,This game is just like the 98 version except it has better graphics and terrible commentators. I thought it was way to easy and I just wasted my time playing it.
2,Forgetable Characters,"It could be just me, but it seemed that book was jumping back and forth between different people so quickly and briefly, that I just plain got annoyed. One conversation/senerio would take place for about a 1 1/2 pages, then it would move on to something else for a while, then back to the main characters, then on to someone else who had been in the book previously, but in such an immemerable way that I couldn't remember who it was, then some more new people (or where they???) then back to the main characters.... This constant jumping back and forth made it difficult for me to keep track of the secondary character.I couldn't even read the whole book. I made it about 1/3 of the way through before I finally decided to take a loss with this one."
1,Drivel,"I agree with the more negative reviews, this novel was a sad SAD disappointment to the genre. The writing could have been good, but the story was atrocious and the writing style could hardly save the plotline."
4,good alternative,"This book is a Christian alternative to some of the popular secular series such as Goosebumps. Preteens will not only read a well written story, but they will learn more about faith and trust in God.Yes, this is an evangelical book and it says so in the description. If you have preteens, especially boys, and want to give them a good story with sound values, try this series."
2,Don't get the Region 1 version!,"I think that Attack the Gas Station is one of the greatest Korean films ever made. However, the Region 1 (American) DVD version released by Tai-Seng is terrible! The sound and video quality is absolutely dismal. The DVD seems to be a widescreen version but it is a pan and scan version with the top and bottom cut off! There are no extras and the worst part about the film is that it doesn't even include the original Korean audio track! You can only listen to the film dubbed in Mandarin or Cantonese. Tai-seng's releases generally range from awful to mediocre at best and this DVD doesn't do anything to change that."
4,Very Entertaining!,"Attack the Gas Station is an excellent Korean flick involving the life of four troublemakers in a scenario that will change their lives. This is more drama than comedy, however you will find it laugh out loud hilarious when taken into consideration the irony of their situation. By robbing a gas station that has no cash on hand, they decide to hold the gas station hostage while simultaneously working the pumps to get the cash. Throughout the movie, you find out the motivation for each of the trouble makers, and you begin to grow attached to them as you find out their life long dreams. This film features some touching moments, as the troublemakers help a boy fight off bullies, and teach crooked cops a lesson. As long as you aren't expecting a deeply involving drama, or a slapstick comedy, I believe you will really enjoy this film."
3,Should appeal to Three Stooges fans,"Attack the Gas Stationdir Sang-Jin Kim, 19993* Should appeal to Three Stooges fansOK, I'm going to fill in the gap between the 4/5* reviews and the 1/2*, and give this one 3*. On the one hand most of it is boringly, mind-numbingly silly, with a disturbing streak of genuine sadism. On the other, there are enough moments of outright slapstick, and an odd music video sequence or two, to save the disc from complete coaster-worthiness. Though to be honest I might have given it 2*'s if there hadn't been that tempting gap in the middle.If you like adult films, pass this one up. But if you think the Three Stooges is da bomb, except they're too sweet, you might like it."
2,This is a 'good' condition book?,"Textbooksrus seems to have a different definition of good than I do. My book arrived with holes in both covers, dog-eared throughout, including the cover, full of dust, and complete with a picture of soldiers in afghanistan tucked into it. Guess I got the deployed edition. Pretty obvious textbooksrus will label their books as they feel fit regardless of their actual condition. Will not purchase from them again."
3,A MELLOW MYSTERY...,"This mystery is a pleasant, quick read which keeps you guessing. Cogently written in spare, lean prose, the author expertly moves the plot along, though she falls prey to creating certain situations which strain belief. This is a fault of characterization, however, and not of plot. It does not diminish the mystery.The book is about a young woman , Meg Kessinger, who inherits her great aunt's house in a rural area of Pennsylvania. The house is every thing she has ever wanted and then some. Were it not for the sense that someone is entering her house and moving her things around, as if they were looking for something, she would be perfectly happy.As it turns out, the mysterious events in her home are tied in to the death of an elderly next door neighbor, who appears to have been the victim of some skullduggery. Meg's sleuthing takes some interesting twists and turns. It should keep the reader guessing as to who is the culprit responsible for the nefarious doings."
3,Interesting but a bit esoteric,"Fun to look through but the ideas are hard to transplant into this day & age, though that is just what I was hoping to be able to do. The ""Old Fashioned"" part of the title is bang on. But at this price it is a good curiousity to collect."
2,For the young only,"If you're younger than 25, you might find something you didn't know in this volume. Any older, and you'll likely know everything here. I, a 49-year-old, found nothing new in this bunch of fluff, even though I (a) don't even live in North America and (b) have so little interest in sport(s) that I don't even know the rules of any of the popular ones except for baseball.The information here that seems to be accurate comes from general history works (which most people will have read); the misleading information comes from Barra's own arguments, which, especially when they concern statistics, reveal the same kind of typical ignorance this book ostensibly serves to ammeliorate.Overall, so-so."
3,still not complete but better than anything today,"For younger opera fans who loudy cheer today's mediocrities who disgrace the opera stage, here's a glimpse of what real singing - and the Met - was all about. Unfortunately, the gala came too late to show the prime of Robert Merrill, Anna Moffo, or Roberta Peters to stay nothing of Richard Tucker and Jan Peerce. However, what they do have is far and away superior to what is cheered today.Even tho it's not the complete gala (an all-day telecast, matinee plus evening) grab it and see what you're missing. Now if DG REALLY wanted to do us a favour, they'd release the 1983 Gala complete as well as the complete Bing Gala from 1972. They recorded it (1 LP was released and a second announced but never released) so they cergtainly have the audio if not the video as well. And the singing in 1972 eclisped 1983 by a good deal!"
4,The Metropolitan Oper Centennial Gala,"It's amazing that the Met is over 100 years old. Great singers, conductors and directors have helped it become the pre-eminent opera house in the world. All of the performances are excellent though I wish that they would look to their archives and show arias from past singers such as Beverly Sills , Jussi Bjorling, Lilly Pons, Rise Stevens. I know that they have video recordings but they see reluctant to release them."
5,This is a great product!,"A little over two years ago, my four year old daugther decided she wanted to display her artwork on the back of the bathroom door. She used a permanent marker and conveniently forgot the paper. Well, we have tried everything to get that marker off the door. Someone recommended that I try the eraser.Within 5 minutes the drawing, that we've used everything but paint stripper to remove, was history. Because the door is wooden, I was afraid it would harm the finish. There was no problem. I then used it to remove crayon marks off the other decorated walls.I only used half the sponge. So, they are quite durable. I will definitely buy this again."
2,Decent...but not for me,"I bought this product because I saw the commercial and it seemed like a good idea...I got home, I just wanted to ""swipe"" my stovetop and my bathroom vanity...Swiping? More like scrubbing...and the sponge fell apart...I find a spray of Fantastik Heavy Duty and a swipe of my paper towel works much better and faster! Plus when cleaning a kitchen and bathroom, do you really want something that seems like a sponge wet with water? I personally like to see some foaming, soapiness, to psychologically please me and make me feel like the places are being sanitized.....Will I buy again? NoWhy? For the price didn't work great...found that other cleaning products work better/faster"
2,Bad typesetting...,The font type was old and distracting. I like Dorothy Parker and found the reading not attractive.
2,Missing hardware! Should have heeded other's warning.,"If you don't live near a hardware store to be able to buy missing nuts and bolts and if you aren't very handy, you should pass on this one.The printed instructions were blurred and therefore hard to follow.Parts aren't ""True"" which distorts the finished product. Too bad because with just a little extra attention to the packaging of the hardware and alignment work on the parts this could be a great wagon."
4,Great protection but inflexible disposition,"I love these potholders! They really provide great protection from the heat and are wonderfully easy to clean (just ""run them under the faucet"" or wipe them and re-hang them). I actually like the holes at the top to hang them by and do not agree with the review that said the holes were hazardous (unless one can't figure out NOT to put your finger THROUGH the only opening that is not protected! DUH?) So what would I change...they are very inflexible and that makes it difficult to take things out of the oven without a lot of fiddling to make sure you've ""got a grip"". I would definitely buy them again but they are so sturdy I can't imagine having to replace them and with the handy little holes to hang them I don't plan on losing them."
3,Just okay,"Clunky, clumsy, stiff, if you successfully use padded potholders (or even kitchen towels) these are not all that pleasant. I've pretty much used them as hotPADS for beneath hot pots and not as potHOLDERS. I should have spent my money on new cotton padded potholders. I suspect these will end up in my FreeCycle bag."
3,Well worth the Money!,"I got the WebCamll as a gift, about about 5 months ago. It took a little while to get the hang of it, but I did it with the help of the directions it was easy to setup and use. They make a parallelport model, and a usb model. For some one like me who has loved ones accross the country, it performs well enoughfor me to recognize my my family, and at a great price, actually I am looking for three more."
2,Cheap looking shovel,"To avoid the annoyance of returning and selecting another shovel, I decided to keep this one despite the fact it looks like it won't make it through the winter. The scoop part is made from clear plastic--not too impressive. It's very light weight. Not a good value for the money from what I can see. Time will tell."
1,Poorly written book.,"This book somehow makes me want to give up C++. It is written in such a way it seems the author wants to make it extremely painful to his readers. Many sentences are written in pseudo-english that forces you to reread it many times, but still cannot understand what he is trying to say."
1,In fact no star at all !,"Well, my only intention was just learn some C++.. But the book has more ""advice from the guru"" and some more unnecessary stuff than C++; the book could have been in a more compact form. Seems more than a book on large scale programming than a book on the language itself.Maybe not really good to do, but when I compare the book with K&R ""The C Programming Language"", I see that K&R is more compact and gives reader more knowledge when you read equal from each book.I did like C, but with the help of the book, I disliked C++, and when I have a relatively large job, I use C or a functional language.By the way, my ""the C++ language 3rd edn"" is for sale, too little used, in good condition..."
5,Stroustrup has a right to be cocky,"In reference to the previous reviewer, I suggest he buy another book which will give him more code snippets whatever. If I could design a language like c++, I would be sure be cocky. His style is practical for anyone who has done some programming. I could appreciate every fact in it only after I programmed for five months and learnt the practical issues. This book is NOT for beginners. This is of the Shakespeare kind not a schaum's outline. And yes, eskimos sure know c++ and they use it everyday."
2,unnecessarily difficult reading,"I have found it hard to follow his train of thought while reading. Basic explanation of a language feature, its advanced use & the author's preferences are often mixed together, while how to best utilise the feature is not there (unless you are able to deduce from some very difficult sentences). Even though there is a lot of material, the presentation has let me down. A book like Navigating C++ & OO Design which explains clearly but takes you deep into the language is far better than a haphazard collection of information & ideas."
