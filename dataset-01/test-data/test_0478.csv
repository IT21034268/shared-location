1,Photo is of wrong item,"This is not an xD to Compactflash card adapter. If you order this item number, you will receive a PC card adapter that accepts xD picture cards and SmartMedia cards and fits your PCMIA 2.1 slot on a PC or Mac. It is not for a camera or substitute for a Compactflash card. There is nothing compact flash about it. The product you will recieved does not look like the photo on amazon's website."
2,Just wasn't compatible with my pc,"I have a new pc, and it just didn't seem compatible with it. Customer support was fantastic and they spent tons of time trying to help, but in the end it didn't work. I had to return it."
5,No problems here,Some reviewers indicated a problem getting this product to work. I had no issues getting it installed and working. Just make sure you have an open PCI slot on your motherboard and that you insert the card fully and properly. I would buy this product again should the need arise.
1,"Works, sort of","I am an experienced IT tech, and I found this impossible to install on my customer's PC running Windows Vista 64 bit. It may work better on other versions of Windows (but I wouldn't count on it). Tech support is by email only, and they eventually replied to my extremely detailed note with a fix that involved opening the hardware device manager and updating the driver in a very specific way from a version on their web site. I had already tried downloading the newest driver from their site, but that didn't help unless you also skipped their installer and did some manual override. The drive that came on the CD with the unit didn't work at all (even though it had a specific section for Vista 64 bit). I titled the review ""works, sort of"" because even after applying their fix, the device manager showed an error. Despite that, the printer port did, in fact work.Buy this only if you can't find a better option. Personally, I'll avoid this brand in the future."
5,Johnny Frigo Renaissance man,"Great Jazz musician. Johnny's music is accessible to Purist and Pedestrian Jazz fans. Johnny will be missed. I listen to this CD regularly, and the music stays relevant."
1,this book was absolutely terrible! give my baby whiskey? NO,"When I started reading this book, I intended to give it the benefit of the doubt, but when I got to the part where it said to put a few drops of whiskey in my baby's water bottle, I said, ""FORGET IT!"" I put the book down. I will never feed alcohol to my baby, nor should anyone. This book has some really erroneous thoughts to it. I realize the book is older, also, but it was scary to read that you should put your baby on his/her tummy to sleep. This book was full of bad information."
2,Toddler Sleep Book,This book wasn't much help for me in getting my child to sleep through the night.
5,Vermont in Civil War,Author does a wonderful job in capturing the feelings of soldiers and civilians on the home-front. Lots of primary source material. A unique voice that should capture the interest of anyone interested in the Civil War.
5,Another keeper!!,Everything I have read from Maggie Shayne has been pure awesomeness. This one is no different. It keeps you interested as soon as you open the cover! It is a must read.
5,Maggie Shayne never disappoints!,"This book was an Amazon freebie, but the story was great, forcing me to purchase the next book in the series to find out what happened next. It's worth both the read, as well as the additional cost because I can promise you WILL want to know what happens in the end."
4,It is a keeper.,"I am disappointed by the bad review I read. Maggie Shayne's book was a book I had a hard time putting down. Although I enjoyed ""Fairytale"" better, I still enjoyed this book. Of course Ms. Shayne's vampire books and her new ""Eternity"" book is my very favorite!"
1,Disintegrated,This filter came apart from it's threaded ring within a few months. Would not purchase this brand again.
3,Needs improvement,"The sound crackles and has static and it is my second one. I kept it because it works, but it did not live up to my expectations. It would be nice to have a remote with it so you do NOT have to get out of bed to flip the switch for the headset's use."
4,Good Wireless Headphones,These are good wireless headphones. Very cost effective. Used about 15 or 20 hours and batteries still good.The only downside is that since it uses an IR type signal it doesn't work when you go out of the room or if you are off to the side of the transmitter. The upside of IR technology is there is very little chance of interference.
2,Plenty of radio interference,"I bought this set because it was cheaper than buying the headphones alone, which is all I really wanted. I was replacing an older set of headphones that has suddenly started picking up a radio station. I was getting NPR so loud in my left ear I could hardly hear the tv! We have another headphone that my husband uses (we're both a little hard of hearing so we both use headphones all the time) and his are fine, no radio interference. With the new headphones the radio is LOUDER. A lot louder. Since I bought it on Amazon I packed it back up and thought, oh well, I'll have to return it. Then I saw that this Amazon seller's return policy is ""all sales are final"". The manual does say if you get radio interference to plug the unit into a surge protector but it has always been plugged into a surge protector."
1,Unisar Sounds TV Listener - Poooo,What a dissapointment. Don't waste your money on this product. I pick up more Mexican music than TV reception.
5,Wireless headphones,"I had purchased wireless headphones before, but they were able to pick up phone calls, radio stations etc (when I didn't want them).These are infrared and produce good, clear, nonstatic sound from the TV. I am not sure how long the foam cover on the earpieces will last, and as batteries don't last long I bought rechargeable ones. So far,though, I am very satisfied."
2,great and then not so good,"We've had this TV Listener by Unisar for awhile and have loved it...It worked really well...very little problem with static. Then, all of a sudden, it isn't working. It wasn't the batteries. I changed them and it goes on, and there's some static but not working. Very disappointing and I've had it too long to replace, I guess. I may call Unisar though."
3,Good product but ear pads fray and distortion a prob,"The ear phones are comfortable and work well. Over time, however, the ear pad cushions fray because they are not leather and the whole earphone needs to be replaced. Also, the receiver which attaches to the TV must be directly aimed where you are sitting or you will get distortion. This can be pretty aggravating when you move from one seat to another."
5,Heaven Sent,"This ""listening"" device was one of the best purchases I have ever made. My Mother lost her hearing aid at the nursing home, and she is almost totally deaf. These headphones have a clarity that I would never have believed on something that cost so little. We (family and friends), use the microphone when we visit with Mama, and she wears the headphones, so we are able to speak to each other without screaming all the time! On top of allowing her to hear and enjoy T.V., we have utilized this in a much more important way. This company sent my order out so fast, I received it the next afternoon after I ordered it! Thank you so much!! I strongly recommend this item to anyone that needs to hear better, and I also recommend this company for their prompt handling of my order. I will definitely remember you when I shop in the future.Thanks again,JoAnn McGaugh"
5,Great buy for the money,"I've had these for over a year and they work just as described. As with any headphones that cover the ear they do become a little uncomfortable (not excessively) after a couple of hours but that was to be expected. I'm truly puzzled by the negative reviews as I've had no problems. However, when you move out of the line of sight of the transmitter there is a static-ky noise but only for a second. I recommend this product to anyone who has trouble hearing all the dialogue in DVD movies."
2,re-chargable batteries.,"My 1st 3 T,V, Listeners were perfect..easy to use great tone and light weight... When something is not broken why do they go and change it?? Regular batteries worked just fine.Buying a pkg. of them lasted longer and cheaper. With this one you are forced to use re-chargables..."
4,Different that shown on picture,"I'm giving 4-stars just because i was disappointed, as on picture this headphone shown as black, but when i got order it was actually silver, I kept it anyway as I needed those headphones right away, this is it.Beside, this is very good durable unit, clarity not noisy as other units, I don't think you will regret if you looking for something simple and easy to use."
2,Not bad if it actually turns on,"Within a week of receiving the camera I had trouble getting the thing to turn on and would have to mess with the batteries every time I wanted to take pictures. There is virtually no user's manual. It's easy to use, but a manual would be nice to learn about all the different set up options. Also, the several second delay between pics gets annoying. There are probably better cameras out there for the money you'd spend on this one."
2,odd mix of favorites and obscure ones,"I have a few quibbles about this book. First, like the other 2 star reviewer said, there are some poems which I had never heard of before and which don't really rhyme well. Second, many poems only have the first verse or so. For example, ""one, two, buckle my shoe"" ends at ten. Third, ""ring around the rosy"" is right in the middle of the book. No matter how tired my daughter is, she's always up for another round of ""ring around the rosy"" - making this a tough book to use at bedtime. Finally, I thought the illustrations were rather odd - depicting a racially integrated Victorian England...?! Nice sentiment, but rather revisionist."
2,disconcertingly revisionist,"I have (and grew up with) the larger, more complete version of this book - The Real Mother Goose. I don't have any particular fondness for it, most of the nursery rhymes are outdated, quaint, often sexist, and grim. But this edition surprised me with the editorial decision to African-Americanize a handful of the children in the drawings, ostensibly to make it more ""inclusive"" at the risk of completely revising history. A small black boy in Victorian dress dances with a small white girl and her grandmother (?) to ring around the rosies, which, of course, is about dying of the Plague. You may draw your own conclusions about this, clearly we're complex terrain trying to teach 21st century children to be color-blind while teaching them rhymes that are centuries old and from a time of complete social stratification. I simply felt someone needed to point it out."
3,"Basic intro to customer experience, a bit dated","I bought this book along with several others in order for a project at work around redesigning the customer experience. This book is already a bit ""old"" (5 years) in that it doesn't address the huge world of the internet and pervasive connectivity.I found it basic and skimmed over much of it. I would have appreciated more ""worksheets"" and templates like some other titles (like ""managing the customer experience"" by Smith & Wheeler). The author's examples and work history give color and insight into the themes but it seemed like it just took up space that could otherwise have gone to more thoughtful content.If this is your first book on the topic, go for it. If you are building on your knowlege of this topic, skip it. Nothing new or earth shattering here and it's not the strongest ""primer"" on the topic out there."
5,The kids loved it (so did I),"This book is filled with amazing pictures of wonderful animals, and accompanied with just the right amount of text to let us know what's involved in becoming a zookeeper. My kids wanted me to read it again and again. The reading level is perfect, and the photos are definitely real-life variety. This is a charming book - and a bargain, too."
1,Buyer beware!!,"Buyer beware! Item sold by Shopxtreme.com is not item under the Amazon page listing (Lenmar brand - silver color) but a no-name brand generic battery (brown color).I contacted seller with a series of emails about not listing their generic battery on Amazon page under the Lenmar brand, asked them to remove listing and put it under a different generic listing. They haven't done so and appear unwilling to correct it. They blame Amazon for the erroneous listing, but seller is ultimately the one who decides which Amazon listing to link to. I filed an A-Z guarantee claim with Amazon to try to get Shopxtreme to remove their listing under this page, but Amazon just refunded my purchase instead of getting Shopxtreme to correct the link.I bought the Lenmar brand subsequently from Amazon and am happy with that brand's quality, so my complaint is with Shopxtreme only, for misleading potential buyers by listing it under this page which clearly says Lenmar brand by Lenmar."
5,Nice upgrade to old Broan control switch,"Though the three switch buttons on this controller are not labeled, as they are for the old toggle switch controller, it was no problem adapting as long as the wiring pattern is preserved: Top = light, Middle = exhaust fan, Bottom = heat blower. Also the look is more modern and matches nicely with the new wide rocker switches now being used for lighting. Recommended."
5,Beautiful voice,She is a lesser known musical artist as she is a soap actress foremost. I think she is a beautiful person and has a great voice. I also love her character on All My Children and watch it everyday.
1,Smells like a knock off,Thia perfume Did not smell like the one that I had previously bought in the department store. Very disappointing... Will not be purchasing this from online again.
2,Not Authentic,"I love Angel perfume, but I am concerned that this one is not authentic. It REALLY doesn't smell the same as the other Angel bottle I have, it doesn't last as long, either. I'd say there's about a 75% chance it is a FAKE."
1,Poor quality - way too loud,The first thing I noticed was how loud this device is - it'll wake up the whole house! The grinder worked fine for 30 days and then just died. Cheap plastic construction is not made to last. Save your money buy something more expensive and of higher quality.
2,"a ""learner's"" burr grinder","The burrs have to be cleaned often, or the grinder will slow down, overheat, & maybe jam. If you're not sure whether you'll really taste the difference from burr-ground beans, this extremely cheap unit is very good to learn on. In the weeks it takes you to get tired of cleaning the burrs so much, you can decide whether to forget about burr grinders, or move up to a burr grinder that isn't so finicky."
1,This grinder sucks,I have had this grinder for about a year after hearing about how much better the burr type grinders were. Other grinders might be great but this one is poorly designed. I have to fight with this hunk-o-junk every morning just to get it to grind coffee. I will be trashing this one as soon as a replacement can be found.
1,Don't Know!,"Yikes,I know we are suppose to be PC, and gentle and polite with reviews. I really don't know how to write this.I wanted to have this grinder forever! I had it for 2.5 weeks, before it burned out! I did the same amount of grinding as I have done in my little DeLonghi. I have had the Delonghi for seven years.The Ariete people were nice there in Italy. I just don't believe I'll be smacked in the face by the wet mop twice.John"
3,Decent burr grinder,"This unit works well and it does what it is made to do. I have a problem with the shape and size of this model. It is quite large and it does take quite a bit of counter top space. If you find you have a small kitchen like I do, you may need to pick something else smaller."
1,Just waste of money!,"I spent around $55.00 including shipping for this product, just 7 months a go, I never used it daily my coffee is very special and roasted at home and ground at home but twice a week, no coffee on weekends I thought this grinder will be my final and best one after trying many other brands such as Hamilton Beach and so on... unfortunately this one just stopped working this morning, I try every possible solution to make it work, the only solution I have is send it back to Amazon who is the seller. at the same time I don't mind to buy another one not this brand! this is just trashing my dollar for Chinese junk products which I really am sick of, so far the only product we are making is Air Plane and babies in this country! can we have our own brands with good quality and pay more? this is disposing our money for every single junk such as this one!"
2,Stand By!,"I am currently in the market for a new grinder. I purchased this one, after much research. I thought I was getting a good product, but I am not at all happy with it. I've had it for about 4 years, but it hasn't worked right for most of that time. You have to stand with it, holding the dispense cup tightly to the machine, so that it operates. The bottom of the dispense cup came apart a while ago, so I had to tape it back together. I would never recommend this piece to anyone. I paid $90 for it, through Amazon, and now look how cheaply they're selling it! I shouldn't have had to stand next to the machine, holding the catch compartment tightly to the machine. Ridiculous!"
3,Lello Ariete Burr Coffee Grinder,"I think this is a very good bargain for a burr grinder. The only real issue is that it is pretty loud for early morning use, but then again most grinders of this type are loud."
2,Mine died. Not a good design,The price sure has gone up.... I paid $29.99 for this from Amazon a few years back. It is a nice looking unit. It is fairly loud and eventually clogs and requires a lot of work to clean it out again. Mine clogged again recently and after cleaning it out it won't work. I'm in the market for another grinder and I won't be buying another one of these.
4,So far so good...,"You won't find a better deal on a good burr grinder. For the price, this is a great item. It works very well. The only minor setbacks are: a) that it takes time to figure out the right amount of coffee you need to grind per pot, and b) it is somewhat complicated to disassemble the top at first for cleaning. Both of these issues are easily resolved with a little experience using the machine. Also, we love the design. Aesthetically it's very cute and is not too big or too small on the countertop. Overall, a great purchase!"
1,Prepare to use your own chain ...,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas, thinking it would be a cute gift from my daughter, but unfortunately when it arrived, the chain was a big tangled mess! Trying to make the best of it, I spent over an hour untanling the chain to find that the clasp was broken, rendering the necklace totally useless! All I have to say is, you're basically paying for the charm ... be prepared to use your own chain."
4,COMFORTABLE,Very comfortable. it is very convenient that it has also the underwear attached. Looks pretty not too long so you can wear it with mini skirts too. Does not provide very good shaping. That's why it is comfy I guess. If you are not sure about the size get smaller one. I am 5'7' and 140 pounds got medium but I wish I got the small one. I suppose I am gonna order small in another color soon.
4,Why Did This Series End??,"I still have all four and was sure I would enjoy many more in the future. Then the author disappeared and the series dried up. I occasionally search for a new effort but now know it's not going to happen. Have never found any reason (author dying, retiring etc) why the author stopped. Loved the protaganists and their give and take."
2,"Not originals, Not the very best","All one has to do is click the sound clip links above to hear that this is yet another greatest hits collection that does NOT feature the original recordings. This is at least true of ""Sunshine"" and ""Annie's Song."" Also missing here are ""Fly Away"" with Olivia Newton-John and ""Thank God I'm a Country Boy."" It seems the only way to enjoy John Denver's classics today is to buy the original Greatest Hits (I & II), though unfortunately they do not appear digitally remastered. If anyone knows of a one or two CD complete set of original greatest hit recordings that is remastered, I'm all ears."
5,Get REady To Blast Off,"One of the hottest rock recordings I own and have ever heard. Every single tune is a gem and if you like fantastic groups like Los Straitjackets you will love this music.Buy this CD, strap yourself in and get ready to be blasted into the outer reaches of the rock n' roll universe courtesy of the Neanderthals!More than 5 Stars if I could....."
1,NEW ???,"OVER THE YEARS I HAVE READ MOST OF MR. DARDEN'S OTHER BOOKS ( I PREFER NOT TO USE THE TERM ""DR."" AS I BELIEVE THIS SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR THE MEDICAL PROFESSION). I CAN FIND VIRTUALLY NOTHING ""NEW"" IN THIS BOOK. I ALSO FOUND IT A BIT STRANGE THAT IN THE PHOTOS ACCOMPANYING THE EXCERSISE DESCRIPTIONS SUCH OLD FASHIONED LOOKING EQUIPMENT WAS USED.MY ADVICE IS TO INVEST YOUR MONEY IN ""HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING"" BY JOHN PHILBIN AND/ OR ""MAXIMIZE YOUR TRAINING"" BY MATT BRYZCKI (SIC?)."
1,Garbage!,Having extensive higher education in the health/fitness field my review is this: Don't buy this book! It features bodybuilders from the 80's and before. Little of the information is accurate and useful. Some of the concepts don't even make sense. Bottom line: save your money for something else!
3,Just finished reading it,"I am a beginner to this program (bought it a few weeks ago) and have just started using the program. I have given three stars because it was a very informative book for which a lot (not all) of the concepts make a lot of sense.I cant give it more or less (yet) because I have just started using the program. I wont judge before I try it. which is what I advise to everyone. open yourself up and forget about your opinion use something and if it doesnt work for you then you actually can state why it is so bad. Not because you read it and felt like stating some other facts.anyways, ill post back in a few months and honestly state a fact of whether it worked or not for me."
3,Give Darden credit :,"He maintains credibility while contradicting himself when profitable: After years of Nautilus cams refining variable resistance, (correct resistance through the full range of motion), Nautilus bought 'Bowflex'. Bowflex has 'ramping' resistance curve: If you set the resistance to be 'good' in the middle of the movement, it will too easy at the beginning, and too difficult at the end.. SURPRISE! : Suddenly a good resistance curve isn't so important; just disregard it! It seems that Nautilus/Bowflex has generated enough income to bribe many otherwise trusted trainers into spouting the same crap. I think Nautilus must have sold Bowflex: Darden's moved on to another pitch."
1,WHAT?!!!...............,"I am not impressed with this book at all. I receive e-mails form Men's Health and they make the most elaborate claims so I should have not expected anything different this time around. I vowed not purchase another one these ""life changing books"" from Rodale but I decided to purchase this one. I was in desperate need of finding a book that appeared to address my workout goals. WORKOUT LESS and ACHIEVE MORE RESULTS......I was think this it it for me. I played sports all of my life and I thought this would fit perfectly into my lifestyle because my body has suffered from some wear and tear over the years. This book did not provide anything insightful for someone with my workout history and fitness level. Complete waste of money and I am thoroughly disappointed in this product. I definitely forswear all past, present, and future RODALE books/products. UGGHHHH!!! would have summarized this review more appropriately."
5,Haruki what else can I say,Huruki Murakami is one of the best authors out today. If you haven't read anything by him then I suggest Norweigan Wood. I think it is his best although all his novels are great including this one. You won't be disappointed with this purchase.
4,Great read,"Some might say that I shouldn't say that I enjoyed this book without being able to say why, that's about the best I can do at the moment. Murakami definitely isn't for everyone, but if you've enjoyed his work in the past, this is highly recommended."
2,IF IT LOOKS LIKE DOG AND SMELLS LIKE A DOG.........,"All Haruki Murakami readers are at a disadvantage I think when they read his novels in translation as the translator stands in between Murakami and his readers. How much of Murakami do we really ""get?"" This thought was running through my head while I read ""Sputnik Sweetheart,"" a very simple and straight forward novel. A novel with little for me in which to sink my teeth. Which is not to say that SS was not mildly diverting and nicely written or re-written by Phillip Gabriel. But a major Murakami novel or one with high-toned intentions and thoughts...? No not at all. What ""Sputnik Sweetheart"" is is a very high quality beach or pool novel. And in that sense it succeeds admirably."
5,Reminds me of my trip to Rome,I was in Rome this summer with my husband and songs from this CD played often on the radio and on Italian MTV. Thankfully a merchant wrote down the name of the artist when I inquired about the song and I was only able to find the CD for purchase at [...] so I am a very pleased customer.
3,Producto está mal identificado,"Este disco compacto no es el primer album de Miguel Mateos (Zas) que se intitulaba ""Zas"" sino uno más de un serie discos de éxitos (creo que se llama ""Éxitos de Miguel Mateos (Zas)"". Si buscas completar tu colección no compres este producto. En cuanto al producto es bueno pero al ser de un concierto el sonido no es lo mejor."
2,Retro Candy Basket,I did not think the quality of the product was what the description said. States it was 2lbs of candy when it came weighed it on postal scale one 1 pound 4 oz. Not what I bargained for. Very small for the price.
4,So Much Fun!!,"I bought this for a gift for my brother-in-law. He loves any candy but particularly the penny candy we used to buy in the store as kids. We had so much fun watching him take out each piece and listening to the stories of things we used to do as kids!! The only thing I was a little disappointed with was that it wasn't bigger. It was such a hit though, it was gone in no time flat!! And much enjoyed!!"
1,Disappointing to Say the Least,"I lived in New England for 26 years and have eaten more than my fair share of lobster bisque. It's one of my favorites.The stuff that came out of the can is very dark orange-colored which is not typical for lobster bisque, devoid of any flavor, and just plain gross. It could not be eaten out of the can because of the dreadful flavor. There is no cream in this soup and any bisque is heavy with cream. There's milk, wheat flour, and teeny dots of lobster. I'm a good cook but I doubt that I can doctor this up to taste like anything worth eating.When I read the other negative reviews, I thought...oh well. Folks from other parts of the country don't know what real lobster bisque tastes like, but surely Bar Harbor is doing it right. WRONG. As a New Englander, I know what good lobster bisque tastes like and it's not this.Unless you enjoy mystery food and dislike lobster, I'd advise against purchasing this."
1,Bad batch??,"We just bought 3 cans for $3.00 each at JobLot. Granted, JobLot is a discount place and these cans sell for $5.00 each. We love Lobster Bisque. We love all types, restaurant, canned, supermarket, whatever.... We opened up one can up today and four of us tried it. It tasted horrible!! It was brown and tasted like bad fish. No lie. All of us were repulsed. I looked up the reviews on the internet, like here, thus wondering if Bar Harbor made a bad batch and sold them off to Job Lot. Anyways, we have two more cans to try. We will certainly not buy this brand again."
5,Great CD,This is another great CD done again. I know you will enjoy this one also because it also minister to your soul in knowing and appreciating the thinks that you are thankful for.
4,The Greatest Fishing Stories Ever Told,"If you want to read a wonderful novel of many stories you should read The Greatest Fishing Stories Ever Told. Lamar Underwood has collected 28 unforgettable fishing stories. These stories have been collected by some of the best authors in the world. You go from trout fishing in Colorado to tarpon fishing down in the gulf. Bass fishing in Florida to catching pike in Canada.Lamar Underwood has done a great job in properly putting these stories together. He is able to write the art of fishing.Some great authors that are in this novel are Patrick O' Brian writing ""The Return,"" Ben East writing ""Bruisers of the Weed Bed,"" and my favorite, Robart Traver writing ""The Intruder.""In the end this book is worth its money. It might be a little long, but it gives you a great picture in your mind. Lamar Underwood's The Greatest Fishing Stories Ever Told is a great novel."
1,Save Your Money and buy The Bully at Work instead,There is very little information in this book. If you really want a great book on bad bosses buy The Bully at Work by Gary and Ruth Namie.
1,DONT BUY THIS BOOK!,"There is no real life information in this book. It is a complete paper waste and poorly organized. Monday's ""Dilbert"" has more value."
3,"Entertaining, but flimsy","THE DISAPPEARED kept me turning pages. I was engaged by the characters and wanted to know what would happen to them. The social setting was imaginative and unique. Rusch worked in some interesting social satire, too.My reservations about the book revolve around what I think is a fatal defect in the underlying premise, that convicted criminals could escape Draconian punishments from alien races by obtaining assistance from private agencies acting outside of the law.If the aliens could obtain our sanction for seizure of convicted criminals, they would also seek conviction of those who aid them in flight. The complicent agencies would face the same Draconion punishments meted out against those they assist.Although, the story is a decent thriller, this contradiction makes for a flimsy, incredible premise."
5,We were moved!!!,"LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!! This group is inspiring. I want to see them perform!Young@HeartThe CD arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I liked it so much I ordered another CD for a friend."
4,Young at Heart DVD,This documentary is a great testimonial about how important it is to continue interests and activities as we grow older. The movie and the people in it are inspiring. It makes you laugh and cry. Truly delightful.
1,Hated it,"Maybe it's because I am 72 years old. The music was definitely not music I would ever listen to. Maybe if they were doing tunes from the 40's or 50's I would have like it, I cannot say. I never got past the first 15 minutes or so. I say, read all the reviews, make up your mind, at least i got mine from the library and didn't put out any money."
3,Good if predictable read!,"I enjoyed this book as a light summer kind of read. There is a twist at the end I didn't see coming. A bit far fetched but entertaining. If you are looking for a quick entertaining read, this would be a good one."
2,Get The Other Disc,"There are a few editions of this single, and you probably want the others. The first has just one CD and contains the version heard in the video clip, the second contains that, plus this disc which hold other remixes, none of which are as interesting as the video version."
5,Very good product,"After an intense workout, I literally look forward to drinking an Aftermax vanilla shake. It tastes great and really helps you recover with the added carbs & creatine. I have used this product on and off for years and absolutely recommend it to everyone. The price is right and it works, what else can you ask?You can probably find something more high tech and expensive that will add next to nothing in performance or muscle gain. Workout hard, rest appropriately, eat right, take some extra protein via Aftermax and you should be good to go without spending tons of money."
4,Absolutely wonderful,This book helped me in so many ways that you cant begin to imagine. The exercises bring you into focus and help cast a new light on the past. You really can heal.
2,"Disappointing, I think","If you have a working knowledge of: Khaddafi, Opec, Voltaire, Napolean, Algiers, The French Revolution, Music and Math, Talleyrand, Robespierre, Russian History and Politics, Alchemy, Rousseau, puzzles and riddles, you will love this epic. Personally, I found it hard to know which was fact and which was fiction. I cannot believe someone would want to read this more than 1 time, even if that. Sorry."
3,It does melt,This does melt from the heat when using it. I like it but it will not hold up with use. The part where it touches the heat looks like it is curling up but I suspect it is just melting away. Very nice looking but not as heat resistant as they claim.
2,Quality Average - Disappointed,"I was looking for a good quality Slotted Turner. This product was not what I had expected. After just a few times of using, it has become worn at the tip from turning hot items in the pan. I have owned other turners for years before that kind of wear was noted. Not worth the money, its just average."
5,Fujifilm 128 MB Picture Card,Whats the problem. You gotta have this card for the Fuji camera. It works great. Produces great pictures and at Amazon's price it can't be beat.
1,how tricky,I appreciate the first reviewer's comment. It is awful for camera makers to use such tricks to control their market share. such defensive strategy will put them in a hole even further. wake up. cp card is an good example for you to learn. thanks. first reviewer. I just change my mind on a fuji camera.
1,Don't waste your money!,Stay away from Fuji and Olympus cameras which force you to buy their propreitary formats. They are just another overpriced flash format which no one needed. xD won't work in any other device.Say no to xD and drugs.
5,Excellent for a beginning or intermediate coach,This book is a great stepping stone for a beginning coach to advance to next level. It explains soccer tactics in a succinct logical fashion and demonstrates how the coach can teach these tactics to his/her players through drills that graduate in difficulty. There are also excellent sections on soccer technique which are taught in the same fashion as tactics. This book will enhance the coach and his players' enyoyment of the sport by focusing in on what's important. Other books that I highly recommend include Coaching Soccer Successfully (this book is more advanced) and Soccer Skills and Strategies (more basic). These three books tend to complement each other very well and should make worthy additions to any soccer coach's library.
3,Confused charging lights,"The product seems ok but it is quite confusing about the lights while charging.Inspite of charging from last one week,i still see both red and green lights when hooked to power socket.I'm confused whether it has charged the batteries or still charging.God bless me with miracles for buying this product."
2,the automobile sales manager's complete success formula,Excellent content!Poor printing quality!Graphs and charts are illegable and each page falls from the book as it is read!Buyer beware!
5,Excellent purchase!,These lights are very pleasant colors. I am proud to have them on the house and on the tree as well. Would buy again!
2,Not the same as prior versions,"Ordered 10 sets of these lights to match previous purchase of 20 sets (picture on Amazon website is identical to lights purchased previously). Lights received, however, are the new version. And, one would think the new version would be better. Wrong!These lights DO NOT come with spare bulbs or with spare fuses. There are one-to-two lights per string where the cap (or the LED) does not stay on the fitting. New version is a screw-on cap and the threads in the cap are stripped. Only reason for the two stars is the Amazon price!Kudos to Aubuchon Hardware, the vendor that shipped the lights, which has gone out of its way to make good on the defective lights.Unfortunately, ""Ultimate"" on the Good Tidings box means it's no longer ultimate quality but an ultimate pain!Major disappointment."
2,Won't buy more,"Well, I read the other reviews that indicated that these are sometimes good, and sometimes not. I figured I had a 50/50 chance, and they're cheap. Not cheap enough, I'm afraid. I bought three strands, and all three are missing some of the light covers, and two are missing entire lights. All three still light up, so it isn't worth the effort or the cost to send them back, but I'm not at all pleased. There are no fragments of plastic in the boxes, so these were packaged that way. After paying shipping, I would have actually paid about the same at Home Depot for better lights. My mistake, and one I won't repeat."
3,To Brave Alaska,This DVD is a great adventure film. Great to watch with the family or alone. Keeps you wanting more.
1,History with an Agenda,"Generally well written prose, Evan's ""The American Century"" is rife with examples of his left-leaning tendencies. Throughout the book, every Democrat is described in noble and glowing terms. Errors made by the liberals are explained away as casual mistakes or honest misunderstandings. Democrats are universally portrayed as virtuous and well-meaning. Conversely, all Republicans/conservatives are shown to be mean-spirited and their policies are donation driven and designed to hurt the ""average"" American. I understand that every historian writes with a particular bias, but the totality of it here makes the work unreadable to less idealogically-driven readers."
1,Not for dating!,"Sorry but this product gives one Moose-Breath and I should know; I dated a moose from Canada once and it's not for the faint of heart. It also adversely effects the mind in various ways; I constantly twitch around other Americans assuming they're all carrying weapons, I wish professional basketball had more fights and for some reason I resent the Quebecois, and I don't even know what the hell that is!"
3,"Makes you feel Canadian, but not look Canadian","I bought this to use while traveling overseas. Normally I just wear a Canadian flag so people aren't mean to me for being American, but I thought this would seem more natural.The problem is although I feel Canadian when I use it and it's permanently transformed my life, I don't look Canadian to others. I just have uncontrollable urges to eat maple candies, buttertarts, and Nanaimo bars, and I didn't even know what buttertarts or Nanaimo bars were before they were all I could think about. I've gained thirty pounds so far - use at your own risk."
2,"Design has promise, one major flaw","No apparent issues with quality, seems sturdy enough. The flaw is with the sizing - the lower hook part from which your ear protection hangs is a little over 1"", meaning modern ear protection with wider, more comfortable head bands (the part that connects the two ear pieces and goes over your head) will not fit in this holder. Otherwise, no issues - works as advertised. Make sure you measure before you buy."
3,"Fits 1.5"" Wide Head Band","I got this for myHoward Leight R-01526 Impact Sport Electronic Earmuffand it did not fit it. The earmuff would only fit with it in sideways with the earmuff parallel to the ground. I tried my spare Howard Leight Thunder 29 earmuff and it fits perfectly with the earmuff perpendicular to the ground. It does not fit a head band that has more than a width of 1.5"". The product would be better if it had a wider clip."
3,SUPERBOWL 40 STEELER JACKET,Great hoodie to add to your collection if you are a football fanatic and a true steelers fan. it is a zipper jacket with the steelers logo and superbowl xl champions. keeps you warm for those cold days and nights!!!!
1,"Can't Fall Asleep? If So, Buy This DVD","This DVD is made up of two separate programs--""Swimsuit Sensations"" and ""Knockout Workout."" Warning--there is very little difference between the two shows--TONS of duplicate footage is used, and both shows are INCREDIBLY boring at that. The three actresses featured--who barely qualify as ""scream queens""--are only marginally attractive, and the music is awful. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. Only recommended if you want to fall asleep fast!"
3,Not Layton's best but good read,"In several of Ms. Layton's Signet Regency Romances, there are several men pursuing the same woman. False Angel is different in that two women want the same man. Leonora is the daughter of a viscount, Annabelle is her country cousin, and the two women are complete opposites. Annabelle is a user and she is tired of being poor and wants Joss, the Marquess of Severne, for his title and wealth. Leonora thinks Annabelle is fragile and vulnerable and falls for her ""woe is me"" style. Leonora has been attracted to the divorced marquess for five years. When Joss starts to notice Leonora in return, Annabelle tells him lies about Leonora to separate them. When Joss turns his attentions to Annabelle, Leonora wonders what went wrong.To me, this book wasn't up to par with The Duke's Wager, Lord of Dishonor, etc., but it wasn't bad either."
4,Groovy,"I am a fool for literate lyrics, and this disc has loads of them. My SO said they were a bit cynical, but I told her that they were NY, that's all. Also, Kelly Flint's vampish readings really work for me.That said, they lost a point with me for sliding over part of the hook in their otherwise sharp reading of ""Walk on the Wild Side"" (...and the colored girls say...)."
3,disappointed,After the Unauthorised album with its haunting vocals this did not appear to be progress nor indeed as good.
3,funk fan 06,"This was okay, I think he missed some songs that would have made the crowd jump..i.e ""Love Jones"", ""I wanna thank you"" all on that real mutha for you album...and ""Lone Ranger"". He sang ""real mutha for you twice and I felt he could have filled that time with the other songs mention above. But nonetheless, I really like Johnny G and I'm glad to have the DVD in my concert collection. If I find another one that was performed in the states I would scoop that one up too."
1,What Guitar...?,What Guitar...?Not in this show !Wanted a refund but I waited a few days to long.This James Brown wana be can't play guitar even when he attempts to.James prob. played guitar better than this fool.WASTE OF MY MONEY...IT'S SHELVED !
5,Great book for beginner,"Great book, really like this book it has helped me alot as I am just beginning in showing.What I really like about this book is it shows detailed pictures and information.It has alot of pages on stacking and gaiting it shows you step by step how to teach your dog to stack and gait.It has information on counting points, how to enter a show and everything you need to bring to a show and how a show works. Really great book for a novice, easy to understand."
1,"Should not be titled ""Web Sites That Work""","This book SUCKED! It does not have the content that its title would suggest. It should have been titled ""Roger Black: A Biography."" It was a waste of money, except if you were looking for a good print reference. Good for designers, bad for techies."
4,Great fun!,"This was the first painting-by-numbers that I've bought and I had a lot of fun with it! It didn't turn out exactly like the photo, but I wasn't expecting it to with it being my first time :) The painting is gorgeous and I plan to hang it up :D"
2,Cold Water/Warm Heart Paint by Number,"Looking at the picture, you'd never guess how difficult this one is to do. There are so many tiny spaces and the paintbrush provided is too big to use on them. There is a lot of mixing of colors necessary. The numbers, letters and lines are too dark so you have to go over them several coats to cover them up and there isn't that much paint provided so to do a good job, you'd probably end up ordering more paint. I don't know because I gave up on it."
3,So cute! But...,I am a huge fan of paint by number and even though I loved the design on this and the paint/brushes provided in this product was great... however the colors were too light and the lines/numbers were too dark. I had to glob on paint over the lines to get them to disappear in 3/4ths of the picture because even after applying multiple coats I could still see the numbers and lines.
4,so far so good,"This is my first purchase of a flat iron. Seems to work well, plenty of heat, not too flimsy.The lights aren't too informative as they always seem to be blinking, but you figure it out fast with trial and error (in regards to how long it takes to reach temperature).Can't go wrong with the price!"
2,It is so-so,"Once it heats up it is great, but it takes FOREVER to heat up. It also has a problem staying at the correct temperature. My hair isn't hard to straighten, but it takes me a good 15 minutes longer to do with this iron verses any other one I have ever used."
5,Great straightener for a great price,"Where I get my hair cut they use Andis straighteners. The girls there told me they prefer them over the Chi. I have tried several different products, but this on is by far the best! I love that it gets really hot, that it is lightweight, and that it never pulls my hair, which is what causes the split ends."
1,defective,"I was looking forward to this iron, my hairstylist had used one this size last time I went. The item took awhile to get here, about 5 days instead of 2 even though it was Prime. I took it out of packaging and plugged it in. Nothing, it was dead. I tried a few more outlets and it was still dead. I returned it for a refund and will have to look aroung elsewhere."
2,not impressed,"Purchased this product at a local retail store and have had it only 3 months and the plates no longer line up when I squeeze it closed, not even close, they barely touch, and it has never straightened my hair as well as the Chi I had before this. I would not recommend for anyone with thick or hard to straighten hair. I was searching to order a new Chi when I saw this product and thought I should review, maybe save someone from the same disappointment and waste of money."
2,BROKEN,"After a month of using this product it no longer heats up and i'm very disappointed, because it was a great product when it was working. I don't know who to speak to on getting it replaces, because I have only used it twice and would like to have continue using it!"
3,Good but not as good as reviews make it out to be,"I purchased this after reading so many reviews that this straightener makes hair smooth and shiny and produces results without frizzing or flyaways. It is a good straightener, but it doesn't leave my hair shiny or any smoother than if I'd used other straighteners. It also doesn't get rid of frizz. Overall, it is a good straightener & worth the price, but it's not as fabulous as people make it out to be, it's just another decent straightener."
4,It does what it's supposed to,"Great price, nice product. It does what it's supposed to and the finish on this product is good. It isn't too heavy or unwieldy and the handle doesn't get too hot."
5,Works just as well or better than a Chi,"I used a Chi iron for years, and this MUCH cheaper brand works just as well, if not better. It heats up fast and stays hot. It tames my curly curly hair and helps keep it straight until my next wash. Love it!"
4,For the price ($16) its great,"Does what it is supposed to do. Gets VERY VERY hot, so I'm glad there is a dial temperature setting. I find that my hair snags a bit where the plate meets the plastic, at the very end bit of hair. The ceramic plates are not salon quality but for the price, its a really good deal. Better than the ones you'll find in a drugstore in the $20-30 range."
1,I JUST ORDERED THIS,It does not take 30 seconds to heat up i waited 20 minutes and the darn thing wont heat up fully... my conair is better than this peice of junk.. do not listen to these reviews on here they are wrong.. DO NOT BUY THIS EVER its a waste of time and money the darn thing doesnt even straighten hair... egh
1,why,Why would you guys send me a product that does not work. I cant believe this action of you guys.
3,don't know,"not here yet - expect it to be fine .. should have waited to review because now I can't leave the page without ... ok, will submit review"
3,Short term usage,I bought this flat iron in 2010 & I only use it during the winter when I wear my hair straight. Last year the gold plate was peeling off & is really of no use. You pay for what you get so expect to have to buy another one within a year or two depending on how often you use it. It does heat up pretty fast however if you have long hair at some point you will have to unplug it and replug it back in because it will lose its heat.
1,"Died quickly, and easy to burn fingers","I liked this item for a couple of months, but I did notice it was far too easy to burn my fingers on the sides. I wouldn't set it down on anything because it definitely would have started a fire. Then one day it stopped heating up completely even though the light goes on.It has like a year warrantee, but when I contacted the company I got absolutely no response.I tried used two other flat irons since, and they work just as well without having burn-your-hands sides. I really liked that this one turned itself off, but I just bought a separate socket with a timer and I plug my current on into that. Works fine."
2,It's ok.,It works. That's about it. It's worth the money...I paid under $20. But if you have seriously frizzy hair or trouble straightening....this won't work for you.
2,dead already?,Worked well for only 3 months and then died on me. Will be contacting Andis regarding a warranty claim. Will update this review then.
3,Good for the price,"I've owned this flat iron for over a year. At the beginning it worked fantastic but with time and use it has degraded quite a bit. The ceramic has been extremely hard to clean and I had to give up on it 'cause a small part of it pealed off. I don't have money to buy another one so I still use it as is and it still works pretty well. For the price it is a great buy and I recommend it, but if you have money to spend I'd suggest getting a better one."
4,Love it!,"I ordered 1/2"" too wide and have burned myself, so be careful what you need! Other than that I like the fact that it heats up and cools down quickly, is easy to turn on and off. I'd like it more if the temperature control could click in place or be placed elsewhere since I kept rolling it by mistake. BUT, for the price - it's a steal and worked great on my hair!"
1,Dissappointed,Unlike most the other reviewers I am giving this only one star because the product died a little over month since I purchased it. It sucked!
4,Great,"I got this flat iron a few years ago because it was cheap. At first I was a little disappointed at how long it took to straighten my hair, but my hair is very thick so that's why. If you straighten correctly, in small sections like most recommend, it works great. I think this has to be the least damaging flat iron I've ever used. It also works well to make curls because of its size. I highly recommend this flat iron."
5,Geri Halliwell Proves To Us That She's Still Spice-y Hot,"Okay, so you may be thinking, Geri Halliwell, wasn't that Ginger Spice? Yes it was, but let me tell you, this is not Ginger Spice. I want you to erase everything you ever thought of Geri and start over. This song is better than anything the Spice Girls ever put out, I cannot wait for the full album!"
4,How fabulous! Way to go Geri!,"When I heard this I just stopped! It is such a great sound. Her voice, the lyrics. The entire flow of this song is wonderful!"
4,The GW700A Band,"I like the watch so far.However I feel that you could have a better band for it. The band should be flexible and made of stainless steel,I feel this would make it look and fit alot better,and would not be bothered by sun screen or other things. When you do this improvement let me know.Thank you,Dave H"
4,The right watch,"I have very specific requirements when I look for a watch. I am a career Army officer and I look for a watch that is rugged, has 12/24 hours clocks, has dual time zones, stop watch, alarm and is very accurate. This Casio answers those requirements. The traditional G-Shock construction is very rugged. The light is easy to use. The GPS synch makes the watch perfectly accurate and the solar power makes battery failure a non-problem. The only minor issue I have had was with the band. The piece that holds the tail down, is a little tight and has to be placed correctly to get the tail through. This is a minor issue and the watch has performed extremely well. The GPS feature does NOT work overseas so the watch will be as accurate as a normal G-Shock during deployment."
4,"So far, so good","I've only had mine for a couple of months. It took a few days in the window before the charge got full up.Pros:1. Full auto EL backlight (comes on when you hold watch at typical viewing angle and only in the dark).2. Time, day-of-week, month and day-of-month all on display.3. Automatic synch with Atomic clock signal from Ft. Collins, CO (3 times per night)Cons:1. High profile, bulky, gets caught on things (16mm thick)2. Many users report only 18 month battery life. (People buy Solar thinking that they'll never need to replace the battery only to find out that they'll need to replace it even more often. You can buy non-solar watches with 10 year batteries!)3. Not good for night workers as the Atomic sync tends to fail if the watch is moving around and sync schedule not adjustable.4. Watch case extends into the band and specialized band will likely not last as long as rest of watch."
2,Consider this usability flaw if you are a perfectionist like me.,"The product works as advertised. It is inexpensive and easy to operate and it is very accurate but seriously product designers, would it have killed you to make the sides squared off? The bottom surface and surface opposite the laser side are relatively flat but when the product is placed on either of the narrow sides it aims at an angle. What is the point if it is accurate to 1/8"" over 100' if you have to level it with your eyes? If you are off by a few degrees that makes the accuracy more in the neighborhood 2"". Call me picky, but I put ""perfectionist"" in the title for a reason. It would be a five star product if it were brick shaped but the little frilly curves and angles easily knock it down to two for me."
4,Laser Measurer,I bought this item because I was buying a new house and needed to make a hundred measurements at the model. It works just great and saves so much time messing around with a tape measurer. Extra bonus...I use the laser to play with my kitten who chases it for as long as I will play.
4,John's Roman Chair Review,The product is what I expected and is functional except that the handle bars need to be a bit longer. The paint finish is good and assembly was fairly easy.
2,Meh.,"For basic switching between computers, this works OK with some annoyances. Why are there two loud beeps every time I switch between computers? Why do I need a loud and irritating confirmation that I switched computers? I can see it right there on my screen.If you don't have the computer active (selected on the KVM) when you start it up, then the mouse wheel scrolling defaults to off. In order to reactivate the scroll wheel, you have to physically unplug the mouse. When you plug it back in it becomes active again. Annoying.I would also like an onscreen shortcut to switch between systems, but this unit only offers a keyboard shortcut (Scroll lock - Scroll lock - 1,2,3 or 4)The ports are on all sides of the unit instead of in the back, giving it a fairly gigantic footprint.Other than that, it works and it's fairly cheep.Better than a sharp stick in the eye."
1,terrible product,"It's such a great idea, but it simply doesn't work as an RF device. It will work as IR device, but is much too expensive as a universal remote. I was very disappointed because I had high hopes and monster is well known company. It just won't work in cabinets and through walls as advertised. The software is even worse. There are no instructions and the manuals will not open up on-line and support is available only 8-5 Monday thru Friday, so when does a working person call? Oh well, a $300.00 dollar lesson. Please don't but this product."
1,Really?!?!,Ok so cool remote right? I spend 4 hours trying to set it up and can not get it right. Whatever I'll call monster right? The guy I talked to said he doesnt know how to fix it call back and get connected with someone else. I put my name on a call back list and no call back... On the phone again for 20 min. on hold!!!
2,"Not self intuitive, very frustrating","We were very excited to have our first ""Universal"" remote control. We understand we are demanding many things out of it, like to be compatible with Pandora's menu and to our Blu-Ray menu and well it really isn't. Also, is too mechanical and to make matthers worse now is just not charging. We don't reccomend this product to anyone"
4,a new look at medieval history,"In this educating and entertaining book, Madeleine Pelner Cosman takes a new look at women in medieval European history. She points out that women's accomplishments have been overlooked and their status misinterpreted by historians. By taking a new look at the evidence, she is able to demonstrate that women were very active in the society and economy of medieval Europe. This book provides new insight into women's lives. Of particular interest is her explanation of the origins of family names and the evidence that some of these names must have been passed down matrilineally. The only real objection I have to this book is that the title is somewhat misleading. It promises to be about women in medieval Europe, but is, for the most part, about England. There is material about women from other European countries, but the bulk of the material refers to English women."
1,Undersized hat,I bought this hat in what was supposed to be a size medium. The hat was way too small for me in the skull area of the hat. I bought a similar hat from Eddie Bauer in a size medium and it fit perfectly. I sent 2 emails (one thru Amazon and one from the seller's site) to the seller and they never responded. I would recommend not buying from this seller Essential Apparel since they do not reply to emails from me and when I checked online - many other people complained about their lack of replys from this seller also.
5,great,"I absolutly love this cd. every song is great, I listen to it all the time. I highly recommend it."
2,This is just way dry,This video doesn't seem very good to me and there's other ways to learn Chess and another thing is I totally agree that you should read all the customer reviews before deciding.
2,Don't buy it for the steam.,"This item worked well enough, I had to put some water in the microwave for a bit, as hot tap water didn't work. It's great for use with the Vicks vapor tablets. I bought this to help during a cold, and the product is inexpensive so I didn't mind.However, I bought this to help moisturize my irritated throat and nasal passage and I wanted steam to help with that. This product just doesn't provide that. The hot water just activates the vicks tablet and helps the vapor travel, it does not provide any steam.If you're buying the product for the steam, spend another $20.00 and buy another product. Might be worth the purchase, however, if you'd like to use this to help a child with some soothing vapor."
2,not so great,"Well, no steam. A cup of hot water would probably work better. I think just using the nose inhaler would work better. Taking it back to the store."
1,Get a hot cup of tea instead,Do not buy this - get an electric one. This is simply a cup and a plastic funnel that you put hot water in.
3,USE YOUR OWN BREATH TO MAKE STEAM,"it works, just breath into it and breath in the steam you made. This is great because its portable and it does work... negative reviews may be from people who just breath it in and don't actually breath into it first to make the steam... so yea"
1,Completely Pointless - Waste of Money,This device serves absolutely no purpose. All the negative reviews are accurate. Don't waste your time or your money on this.
4,Worth the Price...But No Steam,"So this item is a good ""vaporizer"" not a ""steam"" inhaler. The directions caution you not to use boiling water, so it is not going to give off steam. But, the hot water combined with the vicks gives off the necessary vicks vapors, and it does open up the airwys. Perhaps you could get the same effect with a mug, but the funnel does help concentrate the vapors in your nose and mouth, where needed and it shields your eyes. I have TERRIBLE allergy/sinus problems and can wake up congested and stuffy any day. Today was one of those days, and I have to clean and cook for a big party at my home. So I ran out and got one of these, 10 minutes with it and now I'm breathing clearly. Definitely pleased with this purchase though a bit put off by the ""steam"" claim. Totally worth $9"
2,You get what you pay for,"Not a bad item, but being that it's not electric and the instructions tell you not to use anything hotter than what comes out of your tap, it isn't as soothing as a vaporizer. It also has the hole to breathe in the vapors set lower than the top of the unit so not much steam comes out. Good price for the item just not what I was hoping for."
1,Worthless,"Don't be deceived by this product. It is completely worthless. It's completely un-powered and you can only use hot tap water in it. Therefore, no steam. Nothing. Nada. Putting ""Steam"" in the product name is about as FALSE as you can get. Should be removed from the market for false advertising. Disappointing, as I've likes Vicks products in the past. Stay away from this one."
3,Might need a bigger one!,This is ok to cut small bolts and fence with-but it is very stiff to use and the mouths opening is not very big-which may make it unusable for some. I wish I would have bought the bigger one!
3,Rapidly becoming outdated,"This book in my initial 'skim-read' appears to focus on nuts and bolts of NIH proposals, which is welcome because there are lots of other books that deal with the general craft of proposal writing. The problem with this book is that it spends appreciable pages focusing on the ""old-style"" NIH proposal, i.e. the 25 page R01 with Specific Aims, Introduction, Background, Progress and Experimental design sections. This proposal format, though, will be replaced with a shorter form proposal in 2010."
1,not a good buy!,"I purchased this item for a young relative. After 20 minutes, the switch broke off while landing (very tiny and impossible to repair.) They enjoyed it for the 20 minutes. I had to find a replacement gift. Instructions on operation are poor at best. The description indicated that this was more durable. Don't waste your money with this item. This is one of those items you can say, ""You get what you pay for."""
4,Black Pearl Medusa Floor Lamp,I bought the lamp for my son's room and he just loves it. We had fun adjusting the medusa arms and deciding the order of the lamp covers. I really like the convience of three light settings.
1,Disappointed,"These pettipants are definitely not what I hoped for. The actual inseam is 7.5"", with cuts available for ~3"" and ~5"" inseams. I want these to keep my thighs from rubbing together when I wear skirts. To do that, the crotch has to be somewhere near my actual crotch. If I wear them at my natural waist, the crotch is really far down, plus the waist is way above where I wear my skirts. If I pull them up to fit my crotch, the waist is nearly at my bra. The elastic at the waist is not covered, so is really itchy almost immediately. These are really a lost cause and I don't recommend them."
2,Scratchy & runs small,"The fabric on this is scratchy and uncomfortable. Also, I bought a different style of pettipants by the same brand, and they ran true to size, but these were easily a full 1-2 sizes too small (I.e. a 3x = 1x)."
5,amazingly does work,"A year ago I received a free sample bottle from a Pet Expo when I mentioned how my dog is just so itchy but I do not see any fleas or rashes on her. These people guaranteed I would love the product. And yes, after using this for her she was not itchy. The bottle was done, and I didn't order anymore. Couple months later, I noticed she was getting itchy/sensitive again. I remembered this product, ordered it, and she is good. Yes again I have stopped, but also seeing if her itchiness is season-related. I have stopped for 1-2 months now, and I see she is starting to get itchy again and chewing her paws. I just ordered 2 bottles!! I don't think I will stop now."
3,So so,"I recently bought this video, First of all it is an cargo airline, I was expecting a passenger one.The video quality is good but not excellent, its in english but spoken by italians so their english is no so good, you cant hear everything they do, and they dont explain what they r doing. The only good explanation is the introduction to the panels where they describe the functions of most of the buttons in it.I would have likeed to have explained how do they use the auto pilot, when do they engage it, how they use to do the approach insted of just having a cockpit view of the approach."
5,A GREAT collection!,"I wasn't too familiar with singer John Pizzarelli, but I received this and another CD for Easter, and in nearly two months they haven't left my player! Pizzarelli is a WONDERFUL cabaret artist, he is definitely the next Sinatra. With such wonderful classics like ""I'm Through With Love,"" ""Lady Be Good,"" and ""Don't Get Around Much Anymore,"" it sounds as if Ol' Blue Eyes has been reincarnated in Pizzarelli. He sings fourteen moving, soulful, and heartfelt songs that will make you love music all over again. A wonderful addition to anyone's CD collection!"
3,OK book on checkmate themes,"This book does an ok job of covering the basic checkmates (My other book ""Art of the Checkmate is even better""). I think it is a little overated by some of the reviews, but is it still a good book (I can see that someone liked it so much that they wrote the exact same review two times before I wrote this one - daa - doesn't someone check these reviews on this site). Well anyway, I can recommend this book but also think of getting ""art of the checkmate"" by renald and Kann."
2,Dad must be a terrible player!,The book has checkmate problems and is certainly better than Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess! The big issue I have with How to Beat your Dad at Chess is that is assumes that your opponent falls for Cheap tricks and makes very bad moves.
1,Not for kids,"I thought this was for kids and got it for my 10 year old son, but despite the title and cartoony cover picture, it is an adult level book. I noticed my local library also had it in the kids section."
5,Original and instructive book on checkmate patterns,It helps you with recognizing patterns so you can see check mates several moves before you execute them. Its a great book for beginner and intermediate chess players of all ages. It says that most beginner players play chess using five percent of their time recognizing a pattern and 95% of the time analyzing the situation and their moves. A master player recognizes patterns 60% of the time he's playing and only analyzes the situation about 40% of the time. Now I play trying to look ahead to see if I have been in the position before. I also try to remember positions I'm in for later use when I've won. This book helps you beat anyone who continuously defeats you. Its easy to read. More visual players should put a chessboard in front of them with the positions shown in the book so they can move the peices according to what it says instead of imagining them in their mind. I recommend this book for kids and adults who want to improve their game.
1,These will not work with my flash trigger. Not sure why ... simple sync cord. Similar sync cord by Paramount works fine.,These will not work with my flash trigger. Not sure why ... simple sync cord. Similar sync cord by Paramount works fine.
5,AWESOME DVD,"I took Carrie's class so when the dvd's came out I had to make sure I had them. The first one is a great introduction to lomi-lomi and self care, and the second teaches some advance techniques, and more self care. They are easy to follow and there is enough information contained that it is not overwhelming. I highly recommed this to any professional or amature that wants to learn a wonderful treatment."
2,Product quality has changed,This is the third time I bought this item. However the product quality changed this time. Envelopes are much thinner than before and looks cheaper. still works as envelopes.
5,worth every penny,"These are great! Sturdy and easy to handle. The seal is excellent. Once its closed even if you have filled it with liquid, you can turn it up side down and it is sealed shut...nothing comes out.The best plastic containers I have ever owned. These are probably the last I will need to buy. These are keepers. Worth every penny."
4,You should be listening to this!,"I did'nt know much about this band when I first got the album about a year ago. And even after attempting to find out more, I still don't know much. But this cd speaks for itself! The songs are great! It does'nt look like Eighty Katie ever made it past playing clubs, but the songs are straight arena-rock. Probably what the Foo Fighters would sound like if they were huge Big Star fans. Fans of great, lost, rock albums should apply. Immediately."
3,works but definately china made quality.,This little gadget does work but you can definately tell that it is made in china. Bar on hook end is not centered. Bar on handle is not square to handle. I wish they would note that it was made in china. I would not have bought it if I had known it was made in china.You can get ones made in u.s.a. for same price.
2,terrific full sized folding keyboard,"This is great. Like the other stowaways the folding edge in the middle locks one way, but not the other. It will not fold if place in lap, but will fold if picked up by one side or the other side. It has a num pad (with actual numbers [like a laptop format]), the 12 function keys, a windows button. The only thing I don't like are the arrow keys. they are full sized but tapered up in such a way that my fingers fall off the key instead of grabbing the edge of the key. This keyboard is not the same as the Targus PA800U, but the USB connector is compatible with both models. I recommend the PA800U. This is full sized so it will replace the smaller PA875 folding keyboard (PA875 cramped my hands terribly and had terrible arrow button). In response to the other review: yes, when first opened, various keys stuck a little bit but are working fine now."
1,Misleading,"I purchased this CD for the one single track ""Praise My Way Out"". That song isn't even on the CD, even though it states that it is. Very disappointing."
5,Make filter last longer,I used a cartridge when I installed a new filter. The filter lasted for 4 weeks which is really good. I think the cartridge helped prolong the life of the filter.
4,works,Works as advertised. Just wish it came in a larger package than just 1 or 2 since it's not part of the quick shipping offerings. I have to know enough in advance that I need to replace my last one to order more.
3,ProTec PC-1 Humidifer Tank Cleaner,Not as I expected.l This was a suggested item with the purchase of the PermaWick filter. Guess I should have investigated further.
1,Beware of fake reviews,This product is not that revolutionary. Learn to spot fake reviews to avoid getting played by manufacturers.
3,Typical Goldsmith Novel,"Karen Kahn, a fashion designer at the top of her field, should be on top of the world with happiness. So why isn't she? She's dealing with the knowledge that she's unable to have children, is searching for her biological mother, and is selling her successful business, reluctantly. Feeling pressured from all sides---husband, mother, sister---Karen slowly takes control of her unstable life. This book is written in typical Goldsmith style---stressed out female becomes a strong female able to take control of her life----fun to read, but very predictable."
3,Lasted through single use,"Negatives -- the spines aren't well sewn into the fabric; when the wind inverts the umbrella, the spines break loose and the fabric bunches up toward the centerPositives -- closed, it is tiny and nearly fits in a pocketConclusion -- compact and dandy for drizzles without wind; however, anticipate repairing or replacing it often"
3,Well!,Product is not as durable as I thought it was going to be. It is definitely a convenient travel size.
3,Formularized and Uneven...yet hilarious!,"English professor O'Neal teams with his dad (Warden), a clothing designer, to save his failing business and unintentionally comes up with the latest fad: see-through jeans! If that's not enough for you, there's also a love interest between O'Neal and the wife of big Eddie (Kiel, the giant who played Jaws in several James Bond films)! Though the story is uneven and derivative, it still manages to be a hilarious, slick, superbly cast comedy. O'Neal is charming as usual, Kiel is ferociously funny, and Warden is a total knockout. Not for those seeking originality or real depth. Yet despite that, you'll have a great time. Guaranteed."
1,BEWARE! IT MAY MAKES YOUR CAT REALLY SICK!,"This product really makes my cat sick!! I have totally healthy cat that never sick or vomit food in his life. As direction written on the product, I fed half pump of Allerg3 with food. Few minutes later, he puked all food he ate. I thought it couldn't be that serious at first time. So I tried to feed him as regularly but he refused to eat! The problem was my cat has quite strong appetite and he never ever refuses his food in his lifetime! He vomited every time he tried to eat something. He couldn't digest a little treat after he ate Allerg3! It took 3 days to recover his health and eat again without vomiting. It almost killed my precious cat!!!!!! If you're thinking about to feed this product to your cat, please think twice before you buy & feed it to your cat cuz it may makes your cat really sick as mine did."
4,Cats like it,"Cats seem to not notice this in their fancy feast. I have several mixed breeds. Himalayan, Polydactyl, calico, main coon, tabby. The Poly is also part main coon and he eats anything. So this was a lip smacker for him. The Himalayan was more sensitive to its ways...the calico eats around it first then gives in and eats it as well. The Main coon whines about everything but he shuts up when this is in front of him. Another lip smacker. Good stuff. Coats all look much better and allergies seem to have subsided for all of them."
3,"Interesting, if difficult to read.","I purchased this book to expand my very limited knowledge of China's history. The content of the book is interesting and it covers a lot of history in a concise fashion. As another reviewer has said, the book does tend to focus on specific themes for each dynasty but this is reasonible considering the amount of space available.It was a struggle to deal with the language and sentence construction of this book. Words are often used in an archaic sense and there are instances which I can only describe as grammatical errors.Worth a look but be prepared to reread certain sections for clarity. I rate it ***, well worth reading for the novice historian."
3,Sadly to brief for 3500 years of excitement,"All under Heaven is a readable book. Unfortunately its fatal flaw is one of strategy not tactics. One just cannot tackle 3500 years of history of the largest country on planet earth in 400 odd pages. It is simply impossible. For instance the Hsia dynasty get only the briefest of mentions. What happens is that a vast quantity of important history is simply glossed over, and one to two particular historical episodes in each dynasty gets the star detailed treatment eg Wang Mang in the Han. The consequence is that whilst you get a mildly entertaining read and learn a little about chinese history - you do not actually learn a great deal about chinese history."
4,Worth the Price,"I don't do a great deal of networking, but this works just as good as the much more expensive tools that I have used at work. The self cutting does work, you just need to angle it. I am happy to have my own punch down tool on the ready that I know will be able to get the job done."
3,good item does not come with 66 block blades,this item is ok but its missing the 66 blade and punch down. i work on blocks for phones and i need the 66 blades... i guess i have to search for a blade separately.
2,Problem with the fan,"The internal fan is not safely fastened to the charger's body. It's (badly) glued. The fan of my charger was unglued -because of vibrations of transport?- and it's gotten stuck among electronic components, so the charger didn't work at all. I fixed it by myself, but I had to disassemble the charger and glue the fan again in it's original place.Otherwise, the charger works fine: fast charge, low noise (which reveals that the fan is working OK).But the quality control is not a minor issue. Please, Lenmar take note of this. I do NOT recommend this product."
5,Lenmar Mach 1 Gamma Speed Charger,Bought this product about a year ago and have been very pleased with its performance. It is used to recharge AA NiMH batteries for my two digital cameras and generally recharges 4 batteries in an hour or less whether using house current or the DC adapter supplied with this charger when in my car. The charger has a built-in cooling fan which is said to prolong battery life and the charger shuts down automatically when the batteries are fully charged. Lots of good features for an attractive price in a seemingly very well-made product.
5,Cute but...........,"This set is very cute but, Mattel keeps making new Families that are the same people with the same name. It would be nice if they changed their names and made them look different. But still you can pretend that the mom is Midge's sister and she married Alen's best bud. This set is mostly cardboard but you can buy it just to get the new dolls. Oh, and if you find this review helpful click yes below. 0: )"
3,THE DEVIL'S MIDDLE FINGER,"Mr. Ungerman's debut novel caught my interest, but midway through it, I found myself forcing my way through it.It was weird. William Ungerman is a fantastic writer, and he has the talent to take you to these Texas holes and make you sweat and feel grimy.I suppose it was kinda the pace and the main characters that all seemed to blend together, making it hard to distinguish one from another.He is a pretty solid action writer. The action parts were written well. I would try him out again."
5,Beginner Runner,I am a begginer runner and I have really enjoyed this book. I can see why it's a best seller. It has been a great place to start on my way to getting into shape. The author is very thourough in the material he covers. He is very enthusiastic about running wich inspired me to get moving.
5,"Great ""NO-NONSENSE"" training concepts","I bought this book about six weeks ago, and have been working my way through the routines for exactly 4 weeks as of this post. I have lost 14 lbs simply by following the directions, not pushing myself to injury, and using the proper equipment such as good running shoes and appropriate clothing. The book teaches running and fitness in a manner where most anyone, whom is willing to follow the directions, with the desire and self-determination to increase their fitness levels can see results. I can't say anything else cause the rest is pretty much covered in other user reviews. The book is inexpensive and worth every penny."
4,Best Practical Advice,"Have used versions of this book for 20 years to help supervisors in manufacturing understand how their behavior can be perceived. Simple, direct and to the point. Easy to read for all education levels."
1,R Rated,I thought this would be a good cookbook for my son when he went out to his own apartment. But I was disappointed on the unnecessary crudeness of the writing and the recipes weren't that great.
1,"A Man, a Can, and a Bed Pan!",Nice concept...Gross Recipies. Could not find one thing I had any interest in making.
4,my college age son loves this cookbook!,My son loves this cookbook because it is easy. I am not sure I am thrilled about the nutritional value of the recipes but he does eat fruit as well. It's a good starter on cooking for boys in college !
4,Love this item...,"I love this item my little one use it all the time. The only problem I have with this, the top gets scratch easily. But I recommend this step stool, very sturdy. Thanks amazon."
3,works ok for flat cables,"I bought the tool expecting the cutter and stripper to maybe work because of some of the warnings in the other reviews. I tried it and realized the cutter and stripper are designed for flat RJ45 cables and not the round ones. It even says so on the packaging. The crimper worked fine, which is what I needed it most. The product description missed that important point and should be revised."
2,Third time's the charm? Nope.,"After two returns, I received my thirdTRENDnet RJ-11/RJ-45 Crimp/Cut/Strip Tool TC-CT68 (Blue)only to discover that this third one suffers the same defect as the first two: the locking mechanism to keep the handle closed for storage and safety purposes does not function. This unit is of decent design and quality otherwise, but this failure in the product prevents me from being able to store it without exposing the stripper blade, and therefore renders this of no use to me. I purchased a higher quality product for a few more, said goodbye to this several-week hassle of returns, and have to give this product 2 stars as a result."
5,This is the most scriptural treatise on Preterism.,"""The Second Coming of Jesus Christ Already Happened"" is an exciting, very scriptural, detailed treatise on the Doctrine of Preterism. This ""up-and-coming"" doctrine which has truly caught attention nation-wide (perhaps world-wide), is steamingly controversial in Denominational circles!! But this doctrine is so beautifully substantiated by the Holy Scriptures in Mr. Ward Fenley's book, that it is difficult to impossible to refute. Prepare to be enlightened beyond what you think or expect...and ENJOY!!!"
2,Disappointed - couldn't use because of interference,"I was so excited about this product due to all the great reviews, the peace of mind it offered and a friend's recommendation. However, no matter what I tried, all I could do was pick up my neighbor's monitor! (I assume she had the same type) I tried moving both parts of the monitor and tried both channels. Unfortunately though, one channel remained pure static and the other was my neighbor talking to her daughter! I had to return it. I ended up with the much-less-expensive Long Range 900mghz monitor which is FANTASTIC for at night (it's crytal clear and uses sound and lights) and the video monitor for when baby is upstairs and we're downstairs. I love both these monitors."
2,TOO MUCH STATIC,IT HAS A GOOD INTENTION BUT MAKES A LOT OF STATIC AS A SOUND MONITOR. I ALSO HAVE A SOUND MONITOR IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY NOISES UNNESSESSARY. I RECOMMEND BUY THE MOVEMENT MONITOR AND A SEPERATE MONITOR IF YOU PLAN TO SLEEP AT NIGHT
5,Must have monitor!,I bought this monitor before my second child was born in April. I knew I would worry about SIDS when she came home and I thought this monitor would help put me at ease. My 2 year old son was never a good sleeper and I think it was because I was constantly checking on him and I would disturb what could have been peaceful sleep. This monitor works wonderfully and I am totally at ease using it and I don't have to disturb my daughters sleep to check on her. I have used it in the bassinet and the crib and I have never had any false alarms. It's worth every penny!!!
4,Peace of mind,"We really like this monitor -- it gives us great peace of mind. I gave it only four stars because the parents' unit that you carry around the house with you eats batteries extremely fast -- we had to plug ours in after only four days. Other than that, we are thrilled with this product. It works exactly like it says it should."
4,Sleep without worry!!!,"The thing I love about this is the worry about cribdeath is lessened. I still have my baby in her cosleeper at night, but during the day she has great naps in her crib (on her belly) which is equipted with this monitor.THe good stuff:1. pretty worry free belly naps2. alarm sounds in baby's room (which if they stop breathing is exactly the place it should sound)The not so great stuff:1. The monitor/receiver does have more static than most, and is not as sound sensitive as some - but overall very acceptable.2. the light on the receiver is dim in daylight- I sometimes have to cover it with my hand to make sure it is on.3. rechargeable receiver would have been a nice additionOverall a great product, especially for the first time nervous mother."
5,It works well for me,"I bought this at another online retailer. I also bought a Gigabit card for my PC. Testing between my Macintosh and PC the speed to copy files seems about 100% faster (double the speed.)I copied about 4 GB worth of files on 100 and it took about 3:48, and on 1000 it took about 2:06. Not quite 100%, but close.Remember to use Cat 6 cable for Gigabit."
1,This thing is a turd,"It's no wonder they are clearning them out. I was going to replace my D-Link DSS-5+ (which itself is pretty stinky) with a gig switch, thereby completing my end-to-end gig network. But the fact is download speeds are actually slower by about 15%! This is with molded CAT-5 cables, simply moved between the two switches for numerous test runs.Don't bother wasting your time with this."
3,Fine but not great !!!,"I bought this watch for my wife, she liked a lot but somehow I was not satisfied by the watch. the dail is pink and the numbers which appear are Silver, it makes it very hard to read time in an instant. One has to really move the dail up-down to read the time properly.But overall the watch is good. It has many options and finally the bottom line my wife loved it...so even I am happy."
2,Limited usage,"I purchased this watch because it had multiple alarms and my wife needed to be reminded to take certain medications at certain times of the day. From that viewpoint the watch works as advertised, however the LCD display has a pink background and use's a very light grey color for the lettering and numerals. In anything but bright sunlight, the watch is almost impossible to read. As a result, it sits in my wife's jewelry box because she cant see the numbers to tell what time it is."
4,What I expected,It's definitely good wool...not the most awesome edge construction ever but it wasn't 75-150 bucks either. I like it. The whip stitching makes the surface a bit course rather than soft but I also like that.
2,The weakest of the series.,"The Tremors series has become a trilogy, with the third film taking place back in the town where it all started. This time, the residents have to take on a new mutation, the ...-blasters. Direct-to-video sequel features surprisingly good special effects and production values, but it's not nearly as much fun as its predecessors due to the lack of chemistry between the leads, unfunny gags and jokes, a mostly grating musical score, and bad pacing. It does get pretty fun in the last 10 minutes, though it's a little too late by then. This one's definitely missing Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward.* 1/2 out of *****"
3,"Good time, one time only.","""Tremors 3"" is a fun-filled 90 minute trip that should only be taken once. The action is cyclic but the plot leaves the mind standing at attention. One good aspect of this film, being a sequel, is that it is not necessary to see the first two films to comprehend and enjoy this film. Perhaps the cheese factor is high, but so is the fun. Not bad, just not worth watching twice. Purchase, watch and pass it on. You'll be passing on a great night of fun."
1,so bad,"This movie is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. The special effects are terrible. When one of the monsters is walking through a conveinent mart, its computer generated foot goes right through some kinda food item. It looked so stupid. The first two tremors were entertaining and fun movies. This one makes Gigli look oscar worthy. No wonder it never came out in theaters."
4,"As long as they keep make'n em, I'll keep buying em!","This is a great follow up. The first is still the best, but they seem to continue to come up with great ideas for the sequels. This is one of my favorate collections. All have the same campy, horror comedy, without breaking any of the old rules.Keep them comming,Fellas!"
3,FLATULENT FLYING BEASTIES,"This second sequel to the classic TREMORS is better than the first sequel but again can't come close to the original. With that in mind, though, credit the writers for adding some fresh new features to the monsters, like exploding farts, etc., and a much better second banana in Shawn Christian. This one's pace is a little slow at times and Michael Gross continues to become more caricature than character, but he is still fun to watch. Ariana Richards, Susan Chuang and Charlotte Stewart are fun in their roles and good old obnoxious Melvin is back, all grown up and trying to sell real estate. I miss the giant worms being the focal point, the shriekers weren't that fun either, but the assblasters are pretty effective. As in any series of movies like this, the novelty begins to wear off and you risk losing interest. If the writers can continue to morph the graboids, though, who knows?"
4,The Graboids are Back!,"TREMORS 3 continues the story of giant underground worms or ""grabiods"" and returns back to where it all began, Perfection, Nevada. With Earl and Val out of this movie, its up to Burt, the survivalist and the remainder of the town to stop the graboids. This time not only are they able to turn themselves into dog-like hopping creatures but now also have become able to change into a flying menace!!Tremors 3 does maintain the sense of comedy and suspence found in the first two films but it fell a bit short of being completely satisfying. Most of the special effects shots would have been better if they had skipped the CGI and sticked with the animatronic creature instead. Overall this is a good sci-fi action movie, however, I would strongly recommend watching TREMORS first, then TREMORS 2: AFTERSHOCKS and if you still want more go for this one..."
4,"for those who simply must shoot first, accept no substitutes!","I agree with Thivai that the buckle is big, and of course awesome, but I don't think it's quite huge, to me anyway; the butt of the gun might jab one, we'll see, but most of the scope is quite in line with the top of my 1.5"" belt. This size belt is probably ideal, or else the gun may well seem... larger? wait.... ;~)""I like it""/4 stars means I like it a lot."
4,CHeck the size,The helmet fits well. Make sure to check your head size before purchasing. They seem to run a little smaller than previous Giro helmets I have bought.
4,Not What I Expected - Maybe My Fault,"I ordered the Rhinoskin Leather Case for my 1900 Series Ipaq. When it arrived I examined the case and it looked very high quality. Then I slid my Ipaq in, and the diappointment started. The case didn't fit like I thought it would. I guess I should have known, since I have never found a leather cell phone case that I thought fit just right. However, I will admit that case does add very little weight or size to the Ipaq and when the case is closed, it appears to fit rather tightly. Not a bad product, just not what I was expecting."
2,it's not aluminum,"This product came up under the search term ""aluminum"" and at the time had no photo. Verify the style before you order."
2,Its now a one eyed Willy,"I purchased this from a local parts vendor for a few bucks less and in two short weeks one of the eyes quit working and then a few days later, one of the red eye lenses fell out. Overall it is a nice hefty piece of cast metal with thick chrome plating. The mounting tube is plastic but it works ok. My complaint is that the eyes got all screwy on me. I get stuck with it because the vendor discontinued it and would only replace with the same item. I gave it a two bewcause it just didn't work right."
2,They have changed this product from metal to plastic.,"I have gotten this product several times and always loved it. The hitch mount was always plastic, but the skull itself was chromed metal, heavy, solid, indestructible. In fact, I liked the skull so much that I built my own hitch mount piece from steel for it. One that I've had for years burned out an electrical connection, so I ordered a replacement... imagine my surprise that NOW THE SKULL ITSELF IS ABS PLASTIC. Same chromed appearance, but probably weighs 8 oz instead of 5 lbs. Surely going to scratch and scuff now. I don't know what product genius decided to replace a metal skull with a plastic one and leave the description and price the same... But it FOR SURE should now be $10 instead of $25!!! I recommend looking for one of the old ones in a Wal Mart or somewhere that you can inspect it in person... And I hope Amazon fixes the description, which is accurate for the old model, but now is not."
1,Don't Bother,"I'd already read a lot of this stuff, and the editor's text was annoying and pretentious (check out his website for more laughs...) Well, at least I borrowed it from a friend. Don't get me wrong - I love the Dead!"
4,"Great for non-food draining, too","While this probably wasn't one of Progressive International's design goals, this colander fits perfectly in the top of a Home Depot orange bucket. This makes it very practical for my non-food straining applications.Only four stars because the holes on the side are a little larger than those on the bottom and they're large enough that I have to be a bit careful sometimes. I can only imagine this was for looks since it isn't necessary for functionality."
5,I am on my 6th copy,"I never write amazon reviews, but I had to for this book. I am currently on my 6th copy about to be my seventh because I keep giving it away. It is such a wonderful, to the point, powerful book. The poetry is funny, touching, romantic, and rarely sappy. I have most of it memorized... one of my favorite poems in this book: ""Becareful not to fall until you see the whites of their lies."" this is jsut a small taste of the genius that is peter McWilliams. I only wish he were around to write us more. Everyone will love this book, if you don't you might not have a heart... and you certainly have never loved or lost."
5,...And I don't even LIKE poetry...,"This is book is absolutely amazing.Peter Williams touches on every aspect of relationships. His poems are vivid, descriptive, and right to the point. A big plus if you're the kind of person that just flips through poetry books and reads the short ones. (That's me!)I would recommend this book to anyone who is, ever has been, or ever plans to be in a relationship!"
1,a 19th century type,"I did NOT like it, even though I read every single vampire story I put my hands on (except for ""young adults""). It is not about vampires, but about lunacy, serial women killing, self loathing and general frustration, such as could be found at the time, with everybody in a moral Victorian straightjacket (yes, even Transylvanians!). The thing is, even considering the latter, I still can't understand this rapturous desire to kill people-women...?"
1,Product is fine but the wrong one!!,"This charger got here fast and in excellent condition i will defiantly be ordering from this seller again. However this charger is for the OLD razor not the new one, this was my mistake not the fault of the seller, just a warning for any one looking for a charger for the new razor this is not the right one!!!"
3,PHOTOGRAPHER WITHOUT SOUL,"1-Since when dead bodys treat as a fine art?!!2-You'll see how our ""Photographer"" she enjoying to see dead body at test farm..3-Also you'll see how she crying like a baby because no one what to display her works!!!?? .Ok may some Naming her ""Photographer"" but i think we can name her PHOTOGRAPHER WITHOUT SOUL. Please give me you feedback after watching this DVD. Thanks"
1,"Good book, bad binding.","So, I purchased Shockrockets: We Have Ignition from Amazon. The story and art are fine. My problem is with the quality of the book itself. Half way through reading it, the cover completely separated from the book. It seems like the glue that holds it together just didn't hold. I own hundreds of graphic novels, but I've never seen this happen before. Nothing that happened to the book while it was in my care would explain this failure.Anyway, take this as fair warning and avoid this book."
3,Better then my last case but...,"I ordered this case from [...] and it is cheaply made. Makeup cases are expensive, and trying to find one to house all your makeup and hair products is daunting. The pro's about this case, it large enough to hold my airbrush, my makeup and palettes, and hair appliances, which is exactly what I was looking for. The con's, it is extremely heavy and a huge pain when you have to climb stairs 3 flights of stairs with it, the fasteners to keep it shut started coming loose after 6 months causing the top case to fall off when it was lifted or sometimes just walking with it, a year later, one won't open at all and I have to pry the top of the case off to get it unhinged, and the inner compartments started to unglue themselves and had to be taped back together. If the hinges performed up to standards, I would have rated this case five stars, but because the case doesn't stay closed especially when laid in the trunk (consequently everything spills out) it is now worthless."
4,Has served me well,"I have had this watch for 2 years now in the tropics, wearing it almost constantly, and have been really pleased. I'm always a bit skeptical about solar power gimmicks, but the watch actually lost power when worn under long sleeves (yes, we have cold weather in the tropics sometimes) and then recharged quickly when I left it in the sun!My only complaint is that the alarm is very quiet, not good for a heavy sleeper like me, but I just use something else for an alarm. I will say that this watch keeps the best time of any watch I've ever owned, gaining maybe 3 seconds over a 2-3 month period. I like the price that has come down considerably from when I bought it. My coworker in Brazil needs a watch and I think this is the one I'm getting for him."
1,Cheap Not up to Philip Persio Standards a Disapointment,It is hard to believe that this really is a Philip Persio. Their other watches are of good quality and work as advertised. This watch however has a cheap look and feel to it all the way around. The moon dial does not act as a true moon dial should. Right away when you get the watch you think why in the world did I buy this. Many if not most of the Philip Persio watches are of an excellent value. This one you should pass I wish that I did.
2,Moon watch,This watch does have the phases of the moon. But I don't know how to set it up right because it didn't come with an instruction booklet. The band is cheap.
4,Good entertainment!,"I really enjoyed this mystery, and while it followed (in a satisfying way) some of the traditions of the genre, it also avoided a lot of the cliches through the depiction of interesting, non-stereotypical characters and relationships. Strangers stuck on an inhospitable island together, unexplained accidents and mysterious deaths, the haunting sound of bag pipes coming across the water, a brewing storm - these all come together to provide pleasantly shivery reading. The reader of the audio version has a lovely lilting voice, and while it's a little odd to have her speaking in the voice of the American female protagonist's diary, she does a great job with the Scottish accents!"
5,Engrossing and sublime.,This book was excellent. I actually felt the dread of the Scottish Island. The characters were believable and the book is easily read.
5,good basis for german review,"I took German, for four year in junior high& highschool. I love this book. I make cards from the vocabulary words and put them on a snap ring to review in line at the supermarket etc. This is a great reference for the person who had had german in the past and wants to review it. It's fairly comprehensive and more useful than a dictionary to review vocabulary."
4,OKAY FOR 1 PERSON,"This is only 22 ounces, with no room for cream/milk. 22 ounces is up to the rim of the teapot and only good for one mug of coffee. Otherwise, love it and simply adore the color red in the kitchen."
3,Is a fine camera while it works...,"One week after the warranty expired, nearly all my shots had horizontal lines on them. I took it to the Fuji Service Center in Thailand and they diagnozed the lens was at fault. The charge to replace/repair was $95.00. So not a good bargain after all."
1,good throw away camera,camera works good the first day after that pictures dark and blury lcd screen works when it wants to would not reccomend purchasing!!!!
4,Good Camera under $100,I own this camera for past 1 year. Its doing good - both at indoors and outdoors. The picture quality is decent with no grains. I usually prefer to take prints than sharing thru computer. The prints are nice in 4 x 6.The macro mode is not so great...but it works. The battery life is excellent. I've taken over 200+ pictures using rechargable batteries and still battery is alive.Pros:1. Good picture quality for 4 X 6 prints. May be even for higher size. But I've not tried.2. Excellent Battery LifeCons:1. Date & Time is not imprinted in the image. Tried DPOF settings. Still not happy.
4,Yay! Great camera!,"This is my second digital camera and I LOVE it! I was impressed with indoor photos and natural light photos. The zoom quality is great. Perfect size to fit in a small purse and to take out at night without being cumbersome. All the menu options are easy to use & obvious to understand,for those of us who hate reading direction booklets. The only complaint I have would be the ""movie mode"" in dimmer settings, it was SO DARK! It also doesn't come with ANY extras; no camera case, rechargable battery, etc...All in all, I love it! Seems to be a great price for it too! Yay Target!"
5,Nice size connector,I have an old plasma monitor with only DVI input. This connector is short enough to allow the HDMI cord to fit without kinking. The picture quality remains excellent.
1,Terrible Radio,"I bought this clock from a warehouse outlet (for 90% cheaper than shown on this website) and as soon as i plugged it in i knew it was being returned. Half the numerals were missing (the 8 looked like an E) and good luck trying to set the time! A horribly designed radio, what a disappointment."
2,huge clock,"I was looking for a cute little clock for by son's car and truck theme room. He loves Lightning so Santa brought it to him for Christmas. I was amazed at how big it is! We wanted it for his night table, but it takes up most of the space so we had to find a new spot. I though the car on top would be matchbox size - but it is enormous. It is a little too much - had I seen it in real life I would not have purchased it."
2,just the beat.,There are about 2 tracks on this cd that have anything more interesting than a pulse.
1,"Save your money, and look elsewhere. Should be zero stars.","From the title and description, I expected a primer on MSHTML that would help me get an introduction to that huge library, and learn how to use it for basic HTML manipulation. Sadly, this is not what I got.This ""magazine excerpt"" is little more than a walkthrough on how to develop ASP web applications and generate and parse XML. The only ""use"" of MSHTML is the ""execCommand"" method that defers all the complexity to the embedded editor provided by Microsoft. The author does not ""explore many of its features,"" in fact it is barely mentioned beyond a link to the MSDN reference (now out of date, of course).Shame on me for being suckered into paying for this garbage. There's obviously a reason that asptoday.com doesn't exist anymore."
1,It depends on the way you see the book,"If you want to believe that what happened is true as the author claimed, feel free to do so. If you don't believe such things, read it like a fictional book, as I did... Sometimes during reading I thought it to be very outrageous, but after some time, I thought it to be so funny that I wanted to laugh and started comparing it to Lord of the rings or anything extremely unlikely to be true... I give it one star because the author claims everything is real and until now I haven't seen a point of light above the left shoulder of my husband, so he is not my other half... Maybe am I married to the wrong man, sir Paulo Coelho? Hilarious!!"
3,Not my fav,"When starting this book, it felt a bit like some of the lessons from ""The Alchemist"" were being rehashed. The book was interesting, but didn't keep me riveted like some of Coleho's others. Not a bad read, but it's more of a ""borrow from the library"" than a ""must have for my collection. I've already purchased it, but likely won't read it again."
3,An Okay Read,"""Brida"" is a story about a young Irish girl and her journey to find herself, knowledge, and love. Brida is intrigued by magic and the spiritual world. She has many questions and feels that there is more to life than what she has already experienced. To find the answers to her questions she visits the Magus, a magician living in the forest, and asks him to teach her the mysteries of magic. During her journey of self-discovery, Brida comes across a woman that teaches her to pray to the moon, finds her soul mate, comes to term with her past, and learns that true love ultimately sets you free.This was an interesting story. I don not think it is the best book Paulo Coelho has written, but it is worth a read if you are looking for something out of the ordinary."
4,a novel about love,"I am an ardent fan of Coehlo so I read all his novels with an intrinsic respect for the author's unique insight. My critical thoughts about the universe somewhat depend on him...his analogies and his theories.I find Brida a result of deep paring of layers of secrets-within-secrets of the paranormal realities of love and romance. Anyone who is interested in such themes will not be able to put the book down until he/she has read the end. And when you finally have, you can't stop thinking about it:""What is the reality of the unreal?""""What if all this is true?""""What if the woman next doors is a Brida??""This book gives wings and direction to the madness in me. I believe that all of us have our own special madness in ourselves which we keep covering up - sometimes with logical reasoning, sometimes with piety. If you agree with even a word of what I have said here, this book is a must-read."
4,Lovely book,I enjoyed this book very much the simple tale of how a girl learns about magic and her adventures as she makes her way to becoming a witch. I especially enjoyed the ending it made me cry and I've read it a few times over because his poetic words just make you feel good.
4,just one question!,"though i haven't read this book, all i heard was that it's the best!i have read all of Coelho other ENGLISH books and strongly recomend them to everyone!The man is simply a genious!i just have one question though... Is the book on sale here in English?? i don't know Brazilian... but i want to buy the book and i'm afraid it will be not-english! all his books should be translated to all languages... the ones that have been are all better than best sellars! but:MANUAL OF THE WARRIOR OF THE LIGHT; BRIDA; AGENDA and others i can't translate... they can help so many people all around the world!if anyone can answer concerning the laguage of the book... it would be great! on saster_8teen@hotmail.com! thanks!"
1,American Snoozer,Wasn't funny. Wasn't good at all. I kept watching to see if maybe by chance something good would happen. It did! They rolled the credits & the suffering was over.
1,Take the Root Canal...,There's about two hours that I'll never get back. It was painful to watch and never seemed to end. Watching paint dry or grass grow would have been as beneficial. Not sure why that story was ever turned into a movie.
3,Depressingly Hip - This reader unsure.,"Fight Club is a novel I would find difficult to recommend to anyone I know. While it did affect me in some ways, I found that I could not identify with nor cheer on any of the characters within the book. They are weak people who find that pranks and beating up on others the only way to feel accepted and powerful.I must admit that a few scenes did make me think. Especially a small one involving a future vet (at least he better be). But I don't believe that these scenes were enough to overcome the feeling of apathy that the book conveyed."
2,"Lots of Aimless Angst, But Meh. Nothing Stellar.","I loved the movie, but the book... meh. Didn't blow me away. I keep hearing about how much more awesome it is than the screen adaptation, but I just found it to be a little too boring. Besides, the author said in an interview that he liked the movie's ending over his own. HINT: It's never good when the author prefers the movie."
4,Fast paced & quite entertaining,"This is a fast and furious tour de force that takes on, among other things, fascism, masculinity, hope, despair, desire, castration, napalm, pugilism, love and bad catering all at once without losing a beat. Sort of a yuppie ""Clockwork Orange,"" without the Beethoven. That Palahniuk can thread together all the angst, anxiety and repressed desire that surfaces in this novel is impressive. It may not be the ""best"" novel of the year, but it most likely will prove to be one of the most provocative.Palahniuk said recently in the SF Chronicle that this novel arose from his frustrations at having his first manuscript unceremoniously rejected. Hence, at certain levels the novel becomes quite self-reflexive, commenting on the authorial process. A lot of his meditations on fascism and authoritarianism seem less reactionary in this light. (Anyone interested in this strain of thought should see Greil Marcus' ""Lipstick Traces."")All in all, highly recommended."
4,better than the movie,"It's rare that I ever read a book after seeing the film it was based on, but I couldn't resist after I saw Palanhiuk's FIGHT CLUB on the big screen. Surprisingly, the book held its own against the blindingly intelligent, witty, and high-paced film. Palanhiuk has since taken a top spot on my favorite author's list, and I would recommend this book to anyone."
3,"Good book, great movie...","On rare occasions, there are movies that are better than the book they are based on. Fight Club happens to be just one of those. Admittedly, I didn't read the book until I'd seen the film several times. I'm not sure that I'd feel otherwise had I first read the book.The film hits everything right, where the book misses in several places. While the story is great, the film does a better job of telling it. I agree with the other review here that says to see the film before reading the book."
3,"Exciting, But It Makes A Better Screenplay","I did with this one just what everyone usually says not to, I saw the movie first. It got me so excited about the ideas, the characters, the plot, that I rushed out to get the book. And was disappointed. Don't get me wrong, Palahniuk has great ideas and writes biting dialogue better than any I've read by someone trying to latch on to the GenX pop-talk in along while. But he leaves out a greater desperation, a greater general statement about the men of which he writes, a sense of purpose that sadly I found in the movie. If you've seen the movie, don't bother. But if not, then maybe, just maybe, this'll have something to offer you..."
4,I am Joe's Resentful Awe. I am Jill's Grudging Respect.,"The movie was gripping. If you've seen it, imagine slowing down each scene and focusing on each particle of the frame, one at a time. Shine a halogen lamp into the dark corners, examine each drop of blood under a microscope, turn over every particle of dirt till you know each bump on its surface. That's what it feels like the book is doing with a story you already know and experienced with a safety filter. The intensity is sometimes too graphic to bear. Initially the story carries you through in horrified fascination, unable as you are to look away. After awhile your insides start to feel bruised and sore and bleeding. I was glad when the story came to an end, it was such a blessed relief. And yet, do note, I didn't (couldn't) give up the book mid-way. Once you've begun, you're hooked. And that's SOMETHING to say for a book that competes with hundreds of others.I am Joe's Resentful Awe. I am Jill's Grudging Respect."
4,Review!,"I love the movie and finally took the time to read the book. This was a very well written book and was definitely worth reading. It's very similar to the movie in terms of content and style, but you get to see what parts the movie cut out. Very cool."
5,A perfect companion for the movie,"Having read the book first, I was very weary that this could actually be pulled off as a movie. I was wrong. The book itself is actually written in a very cinematic way. It moves at a lightning fast pace, has a lot of great dialogues, moves around a lot, and it has a lot of big, theatrical-like events. To say that the book is better than the movie is not necessarily true. They are both excellent in their own rights, although the book comes off slightly more enjoyable in my opinion. Either way, my suggestion is to read the book AND see the movie, both several times."
4,even a girl can like tough books...don't forget about us,"i think it is dissapointing to hear people complain about how this book isn't as good as the movie. in fact, perhaps it would have been better if i hadn't seen the movie first because the originial ideas of Chuck Palahniuk are the WORDS, not brad pitt or edward norton. if anything, this book proves it's point to you if you thought is was worse than the movie: 1. you like things 2. you like to buy things 3. you want things 4. you need society 5. ""you're the faker."" this book deserves more recognition than any movie screen can offer, unfortunately somewhere between birth and our ""20-something"" lifestyles, we forget to read. i don't deny how much i'd like to take a peice of brad pitt and take him home with me, but he is not the brain nor the words of the original inducer. Chuck Palahniuk isn't the common house name brand. and brad pitt is? how ironic, chuck."
5,"Good book, Fast Shipping","I ordered this book with a few other books and got the free super saver shipping. I ordered the books on Sunday and received them by Thursday. This was a great book, and I would recommend it. The movie is great too. If you've already seen the movie and enjoyed it the book will give you a new perspective and you'll probably enjoy the book as much, if not more than, the movie."
3,great book but i did not get the showen cover i got the movie cover wich is very disapointing,wrong cover shown i would not have ordered this book had i known i was getting the movie cover book with ed norton on it
3,Travel Hair Dryer,"The compactness of this dryer is great for travel. The only fault I have is that the high speed is not what I would call ""high"". It is more like a medium speed. If you have long hair, as I do, it takes forever to get it dry."
3,Strange Movie,"This movie is kind of fun. If you are looking for good acting and plot don't buy it, but if you just want to have a little fun watching a flick that will not tax your mind this is the one."
5,Something for your EARHOLE!!!!,"In a word, IMPRESSIVE!! This band has a very distinctive sound and a broad musical pallette. This is GREAT stuff! I'm gonna wear this CD OUT!!!!"
2,A painful reading experience,"I don't know what Eva Wong was thinking when she wrote this. Although her style of writing was painful to read, I finished the entire book and by the end I realized it wasn't worth it. It's hard to follow her style of writing and she drops so many names and dates that you get lost in her sentences.You will not get any insight into taoist philosophy and thought by reading this tiresome book."
1,"Disappointing after ""Out of Harm's Way""","To all my fellow readers who were disappointed in this poorly written book after enjoying ""Out of Harm's Way"" so much, I believe I have solved the mystery of Terri's disappearing writing skills. Look closely at the cover of ""Out of Harm's Way"" and you will see ""by Terri Crisp (large letters) and Samantha Glen (small letters)."" I have just finished reading Samantha Glen's delightful new book ""Best Friends"", and I now know who wrote the warm and wonderful ""Out of Harm's Way""."
5,Sony Ericsson W800 Multimedia Phone,"This phone was bought as a gift. The form, fit, and function of the phone exceed my expectations.It was bought unlocked and is used on T-Moble system. It has excellant reception and fidelity as a phone. The text and e-mail capabilities are also fine.The sound quality as an MP3 player rivals that of an Ipod. The software is not nearly as slick as the apple product but if you already own the CD you can fit quite a number of albums on a 2 Gig Memory Stick Pro.The phone takes very good 2 megapixel pictures with a decent focusing system and a useable flash."
3,Tina's the best performer,Tina's performance of Whats Love Got To Do With It stole the show but i must say the Janet Jackson performance was also phenomanol.
1,i love tina turner she my best singer in my life,tina is very good and ilove her songs! that she sings all the time now than with ike her ex husbend! and she very good singer
1,not good,"This book is really awful. i dont know how people are giving this book 5 stars, unless its the author's shameful friends....The artwork is total bush league. I recommend The Flash Animator or The Art of Flash Cartooning. At least your eyes wont bleed when you look at the artwork. This book seems like it was written by a kid in junior high. The examples are humourously awful. Buyer beware."
5,Great item!,"The original plastic zip bag and cardboard packaging was very worn, item was shipped in a plastic bag, not a box. I didn't end up keeping the item in the original packaging anyway when I wrapped it as a gift, so not a big deal. The blanket itself was in excellent condition, and exactly as described. Most importantly my husband loved it!"
4,Not the best!,This game is fun but I just can't pass the arcade level so that makes it sort of corny. And the marine biology level is really hard too. It must have taken me about 10 tries before I finally beat it. And once you do a level you can't do it again so you have to start all over again. In my opinion it was not the best thing in the world.
5,Oh mytotalgosh!! This is the GAME I have been looking for!!,"This is the best game of any Mary-kate and Ashley. I would'nt recomend the rest but this- you gotta buy!! In this game you can play marine Biolagy , Cheerleading*, dance and so much more~~ !! While you find the ""secret admier"". In over 30 levels . I like games that has over 30 levels because it cant be ""easily"" beteen. Like magic mistery mall and the winner's circle. I dont play it any more because its really boring and i've beat all the levels. And it only has 4!!! DUH!! It also has a 1 or 2 player system. So, if you have the annoying 'I wanna- play-first-NOW!! kinda sister you can both play at the same time (like me). I would recomend this game to any Mary-Kate & Ashley fans!! (and how knows how to play video games) I would say : ages 7-14. 10 out of 5 stars. 10!!! this is the best game ever for girls."
2,ITS OK,"This game was fun the first hour I got it,after that it was sooooBORING!!!!! They play this music that is irritating. The colors are dark. All you do is go around a game board. When you land onsome thing its says warp or some thing like that and there is so many I have a hard time knowing what each thing meant.It is agood game too play when you are trying to fall asleep."
3,Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer,"I really liked the cord retractor and the ability to fold the handle for storage. It also worked very well to dry hair. However, it did not last nearly as long as it should have - only a few months before the cord stopping retracting and less than a year before it burnt up."
2,does not retract,i dislike the hair dryer and i was overcharged for it; 38.50 by hairproducts.com. icky. the reason i dislike it is simple: a retractable cord should retract. it simply doesn't retract. i hang it on my wall and everyone sees the ugly cord dangling.
4,Andis RC-2 Ionic Hair Dryer,"I used this hair dryer while on vacation and loved it. I like everything about it except, I'd like a longer cord. I especially like the way the cord retracts so you don't have it lying around on the counter. I would definitely recommend it."
5,Power for the price,Great price for so much power. The retractable cord is a helpful feature. Easily straightens my hair.
5,love it,iItried this product at a hotel and wanted it. Is is easy to hold and has a blast of air that easily dries long hair.
4,Not Quite What I Wanted But A Good Dryer,"I guess I wasn't reading the description quite right when I ordered this dryer, I was hoping it had 2 levels of power plus 3 temps. But at low temp the dryer blows less air, and at high temp it blasts my hair making it hard to style. So I just use the medium setting - medium heat/medium air flow. I do really like the folding feature and retractable cord. They make it so much easier to store in a bathroom vanity drawer. It is not lightweight so don't buy it if you are looking for a lightweight travel dryer. It's more of a space-saver in the bathroom rather than the suitcase! I do like the Andis brand, not sure if I would buy this particular one again because of the temp/air flow issue, but it is definitely well made and worth the money."
2,Just okay but STOPPED WORKING,"We have a home full of blow dryers, every bathroom has one and we keep our travel bags stocked with them as well. This one performs as well as any of the other low cost models we've owned but it died 8 months into our use."
5,great travel hairdryer,I bought this dryer to replace one I use at home. It is a good hair dryer but only has one heat setting. I love the way it folds up for storage and the cord retracts which is nice. These 2 features alone make it great for travel!
2,Stopped working after 30 days!,"I bought this dryer because I tried one at a hotel and loved it. It dries quickly and is lightweight and the retractable cord is a plus. However, after 30 days the coils started burning red hot and then it just overheated and stopped working. My hair isn't that long so I don't think it was overused. Just not great quality. And unfortunately I barely missed the return window. I'm going to spend a little more this time and get something of higher quality!"
1,Andis dryers always break,This is the 2nd Andis dryer broke within a day (different models). They make worst products. The back piece broke off and went inside of the dryer. Started making super loud noise and burning smell. Not even retractable.
2,Not a compact dryer,"I purchased this dryer because I wanted a compact, easily portable dryer for travel & the idea of a retractable cord was appealing. It is NOT compact. In fact, it's quite large & I returned it because the high heat level was not hot enough. It isn't ergonomic & it's heavy. I ended up buying the Babylisspro TT Tourmaline Titanium Travel Dryer & I am thrilled with it. I have shoulder-length fine hair."
3,Hair dryer,"Like the size and shape. The only thing wrong the retract cord doesn't work. Didn't last long, otherwise very nice"
5,Well Worth the $$$$,"I was traveling on business and came across this hair dryer at the hotel!I literally ordered one from my hotel room, immediately after using the dryer.Works really well! Love the fact that it folds up and has a retractable cord.Great space saver."
3,"Despite himself, shows Economic Rationalism is Rational","Bob Ellis is an Australian Intellectual. He is a good writer but is politically left of most.This book is a rant by a refugee of the 1970's. His opening definition of Economic Rationalism as ""the refusal to spend money on the unneccessary"" is sound enough, but the adventure from there on is unsound. It is still interesting to see his logic flow out of rational (pardon the pun) to the bizarre.Ellis argues, by way of example, bringing democracy to Russia led to people dying and therefore Economic Rationalism is evil (Arguement 54).His 202 Arguements Against Economic Rationalism are really the same one repeated: he is an old leftie and doesn't like anything that has happened since 1975.Having said all that, I enjoyed the read. Get it and enjoy it. Anti-Globalisation folk will take it as gospel, the rest of us won't change our worldview because of it."
3,Band with similar name,"This is a jazz album, and while I'm sure it's very well done, I was in fact looking for The New Regime, which is a progressive rock band that recently released Speak Through the White Noise."
4,wasn't quite what I expected but works great anyway,"I bought this based on the reviews here and was not disappointed at all. It's sharp and works great. The size is bigger than I expected, but then I have small hands. My spouse who has bigger hands found it comfortable to use."
2,"Sharp but uncomfortable, not for large hands","This peeler came extremely sharp and cut very well, but I couldn't get over the feel of it in my hand. The handle isn't smooth, its rough and unpolished steel. I understand this might be a feature for gripping purposes, but it feels awful. I have large hands and found the handle too skinny to grip comfortably. It is also much longer/larger than expected. I actually threw it out and went back to the KitchenAid Classic Euro peeler."
5,every kitchen must have,"I lost my peeler of 45 years and searched for last 3 years for a replacement. I have bought 6 potato peelers which were worthles. With joy I found the Rada and got to try it out before buying. It works both forward and away from you..I am today buying 5 more for children and grandchildren.I do not see how people peel with anything else,"
2,Doesn't shed peels,"The peeler cuts well but does not shed the peels so you have to keep pulling them away from the peeler.Rada Cutlery Deluxe Vegetable Peeler, Made in USA, Aluminum Handle (R141)"
5,Very efficient,"Very efficient at peeling carrots, potatoes, etc. Its very straight forward in the design and how its made too which makes it more sturdy I think, and its easy to clean."
1,Product Pictured is not the one I received!,"I ordered this for my granddaughter, I am black and wanted a prayer bear or animal. What I received was a blonde hair, blue little boy. I called and told them that this is not what I was expecting and it certainly is not the item pictured, and sent it back. Amazon agreed to resend me another one, but the shipping department sent the exact same item which was returned. So beware what you see is not what you will get."
4,Cute Doll!,"This doll is SO cute!! I'm getting her and all the other Bratz Babyz for my birthday!! IT'S SO CUUUUTTTTTEEEEE!!!!!!!!! But, what kind of baby wears a thong? O.o"
2,Not enough explanation,"Multi Use Body Art Stencils-Set 18I would like to know if the rest of the stencils that you do not show are just copies of the ones that you are showing. If you choose not to show them all, would you please explain in writing what shapes/size they are.Also, what are they made of?Thank you in advance for your assistance.Best regards,Kerry Marie DeanKerryMarie@Insightbb.com"
4,Good watch,It is a good watch. I like it. It is water and shock resistant and works accurately.The only regret is that the style is old. It was released in about 2002.
2,don't buy!,"do not waste your time and money on a casio product> mine quite after 38 days. would shut down to low battery level. i tryed every thing to get it rechareged. it would only half charge.work for about 5 to 6 hours. then back to low battery reading. called customers serv. they said mail it to them at my exspence. oh and be sure to insure it again at my exspence. it was going to cost me more money than the worthless piece of junk was worth. they then told me they would just replace it. i was thinking they would send me a new watch. wrong again, they were going to send me a referbished piece of junk. needless to say i was rather upset about it. so do your self a big faver and just skip these clowns. buy a eco-drive by citizen. they at least don't jerk you around. i hope this helps.if enough poeple stay away maybe they will biuld a better product and better customer sev."
2,Poor quality product from a high quality name.,Item does not cut well. Pictures have jagged edges with this product. I would not reccomend.
4,Does everything it claims,Nice product. My son loved it. Performed as expected. I expected it to be very fragile since it was glass but it was fairly strong.
4,Plasma Pocket w/ clip,"I bought it for my granddaughter as a Christmas gift, she seemed to enjoy it. Liked how it responded to sound."
1,Really not public policy oriented,"The book appears to be a scenarios in business exercise with certain key words swapped out. Filled with references to managers, as if they are the only meaningful audience, and with terminology that is clearly borrowed from business--such as Just in Time delivery--clearly underscore that the book is not written from the perspective of a professional in public policy.A better book would have given much more weight to interacting with the public and with stakeholder groups."
2,What a waste!,"If you are a wrestling fan, this game is a big disappointment. Sure the wrestlers they have chosen for the game are some of the biggest names in the business, but that is the only good thing about the game. You have very limited moves, reversals are way too easy (in one sequence I think I had seen 8 reversals on the same attempt), and tagging in partners and climbing the ropes are almost impossible. Finishing maneuvers are a waste of time trying to attempt, because the instruction book doesn't give any information on when to perform them. Overall, save your money for the next WWE game (whenever that is)."
1,What are you guys smoking!!!,"I find these reviews hard to believe because when I played Legends of Wrestling, I wish I could have gone and gotten my rental fee back. This has horrible game play. Though it might be cool to be the great characters in the game, it was so boring as the set moves were weak. I advise people not to waste your time or money on this game."
3,Mediocre wrestling title,"What's done right in LOW ? Well it has a roster of 42 old-school wrestlers with standouts such as Koko B.Ware, George ""The Animal""Steele,and the Road Warriors, Hawk and Animal. It also features an innovative combo system that makes playing the game one part WZ(warzone) and one part PaRappa the rapper as you try to hit the right button in time to reverse grapples or counter attack.What's done wrong? Everyting else!!!! The slow, unintuative controls underlie awful slapped-together graphics anda bargin bin soundtrack that features MIDI rock-type sound-alikes of the real wrestler's theme. Classic superstars like Rowdy Roddy Piper and Andre the Giant are conspicuously missing, while (now say it while pointing your thumbs at your shoulders and looking like an idiot)""RVD"" and Sabu made it on the list. If you love classic wrestling, do yourself a favor and pass this up, you'll be glad you did."
4,Definately not a pick-up and play game,"I, like a few of the reviewers here, was saying 'what's this ...?' during my first LOW match. I kept playing it though (after I had turned on the Blood and turned off the ring entrances) and uncovered a deep, fun game.The main problem with this game is that the instruction booklet [isn't good]. If you can pick up the PRIMA strategy guide do so. After reading through it I was like 'OK, so they didn't forget to include this' and 'Hey cool! Tiger Suplex!' Buy the way, this game has hundreds of moves so if you do get a little bored you can always interchange them with others.Acclaim didn't make it easy for me to get into this game. If any game needed a tutorial mode this would be it. Anyway, stick it out guys and girls. There is a really good game in there."
3,caution rent before you buy,"ok i bought the game a few days ago just cause i couldnt wait any longer and it wasnt out to rent well ill be the first to sat it isnt all its made up to be. for starters its is slower then most games the creat a wrestler or legend isnt that great. the only modes of play are 1on1 tag 3 and 4way dances along with carrer which only has a single play mode tournent which has tag,tag titles, and single. In my opinion the only thing great about this game is the grafics and all the rest isnt that out of the ordinary. (...)"
1,"failure, beyond comprehension.","theis game was sooo very dissappointing. if your a fan of the smackdown series....this game pales in comparison so much, that you will literally become ill at the fact that you purchased this game. the graphics are fine, but the game play is so horrific, i had to restrain myself from smacking my head against the wall. please, please, please ignore the exciting looking cover art, and walk past this game, it'll be the smartest thing you ever did. learn from my mistakes and save yourself (money). or walk over and get the smackdown for playstation2 ,and enjoy a wrestling game that is 1,000,000 times better than this dissmal failure!"
3,I was expecting a strict sociological study,"This was a very interesting book that discusses a worthwhile topic, but Gibson too often veers into the realm of Freudian psychology to explain the phenomenon of what he calls ""The New War."" I don't buy that men read Soldier of Fortune magazine out of a failure to confront their ""infantile rage"" over their father's relationship with their mother. I was hoping for more of a sociological analysis."
2,old recording,"This recording definitely sounds old. With today's better equipment for recording, it would be better to purchase a newer recording even though the Budapest String Quartet is marvelous."
4,nice product high price,yes the product was excellent service waqs good but the price was very high i got 2 of the same brand shirts off ebay for the same price as the one i got here and free shipping
2,Meh - a short term item,"I travel often and wear glasses, so putting on makeup in a hotel room can be a problem. It worked well for a few months, then the post stopped staying put and the mirror had to be leaned against a wall to stay up. All in all, I am I underwhelmed."
5,My Blue Shuffle,"I love the new Shuffle from Apple. I already owned a Photo iPod and purchased a Video iPod, but I got this one because I needed something to workout with and the other two were too big and bulky. Also, I was afraid the damage that could happen if I had dropped one of the other two iPods."
4,"Small.easy,lighty .. it just makes you look cooler.","I really loved the way it built , when you're carrying it in your pocket you wont even feel it .. in fact i lost it in my pocket once, though i gave it 4 stars because it still has low battery-life. Worth Getting it!"
5,shuffle a nice little mp3 player,"I absolutely LOVE my shuffle. There have been so many times where I've wanted to listen to music but didn't want to carry my slightly bulky video with me. The shuffle is a perfect solution to this problem.Pros:-it's VERY small-it has a convenient clip-the sound quality is decent-the design is niceCons:-the only way to charge it is using your computer unless you buy some other chargerSo far, the battery life has been decent. Charging it at my computer isn't very convenient, but it doesn't kill me. The shuffle is an amazing little thing, and I love its size. It's great for someone who wants music on the go in a tiny package."
5,THE MOUSE THAT ROARED,"wow! how can something so tiny sound so big? after having owned this shuffle for a few weeks now i'm really amazed at it's overall performance.down loading music either thru itunes or your own cd collection is a snap.my only real complaint might be that they (apple) includes a rather cheap set of ear buds that doesn't do the music any justice.do yourself a favor and get yourself a really good quality set of earphones,the shuffle already has the music in it,you just need a nice set of buds to let it out.a nice little machine for a fair price."
4,bass is weak,"since there is no equalizer, the sound is preset. I don't expect the bass to be this soft. Is there way to change on the PC?"
3,mixed feeling,"PROS:1. Sleek design2. Good storage for size.3. Everybody says, ""ooohhh""CONS:1. Small size, lost it about 2343 times.2. Low battery life."
2,The sound quality is not so hot,"I got mine yesterday, returning it today. I changed the headphones of course, but the sound quality does not come anywhere close at all to the new Sony S2 Sports Walkman. I like to hear the clarity in the background on vocals and guitars, but with the new shuffle, these sounds blended together and sounded rather dull. I know I will be in the minority here, but if you are open minded and want awesome sound quality, there are far better choices out there.If one brand is all you have ever tried, one brand is all you will ever know.I admit that it looks great though!Sony Model in comparison was: Sony NW-S203F 1 GB"
1,Don't buy this if you're on dial up,"It's cute, but what's the point if they don't include a software CD? I can't get 7.0.2 to download (a requirement to use the product) and therefore, I have an $80 piece of junk. What a collosal waste."
5,Return of item,"I am sorry to say, I can't rewiew the product.I had ordered it for my daughter, but somebody had already given her one.I returned it to you on 8-18-07. Please credit my account.Thank you for you help.Rosemarie Petersen"
4,I love the new clip feature.,"I owned a 4th generation iPod and thought it was great. One thing about the iPod is I was always worried about it falling or where I could store it while I walked around and it was a bit heavy in my hoodie pocket. I got the new Shuffle in November and love it! I don't need more that 250 of my favorite songs and I just clip it and go. Another great thing is I can exercise with this a lot easier than my old iPod. This is perfect for younger kids and I like the option where you can choose the maximum volume your iPod can be played on iTunes. I think this'll be a plus for parents who don't want their kids damaging their hearing with listening to music that's too loud. I gave it 4 stars because there is no lock switch that makes it so even when the dial is pressed the volume or song doesn't change.EDIT: I just learned the Shuffle does have a hold mode, you hold down the play button for 3 seconds. Awesome! I now give this 5 stars."
5,Great to run with!!!,"Ever have your stride thrown off balance because of a clunky mp3 player hanging on to your arm? Ever have problems with the sport band of your mp3 player not actually fitting your upper arm? Well the shuffle is absolutely amazing for longer distance running. It doesn't throw off your stride and can fit nicely on your shirt. Some people have problems that it doesn't show the songs, but it you are running you don't want to be always scrolling for songs anyway."
5,MP3 Player Nirvanna,"If you are looking for a small MP3 player to use while at the gym or running then this is a pretty close to a perfect choice. It is barely larger than a quarter and has a clip built in. The controls are simple and can be operated easily while you are in the middle of a workout.The battery life is so long that I don't even think about whether i have a charge...it has never been an issue. I can fit many hours of songs on the player but I generally use playlists of 30-40 songs that I create in iTunes.The sound is good, the controls are easy and the size is right. I'm not sure how Apple could even improve on this product. The only thing you might want to do is look at different headphones. I find that the earbuds pop out too easily during strenuous activity and I opt for the wraparound headphones (I use the Philips SHS3200/37)."
4,small and easy,The first one didnt charge on the base or i'd given it a five.....bought it for workout to clip on shirt and not be in way..Perfect!!!! not many choices only has play in order or shuffle but it you put on the tunes you like shuffle works great!
5,I love my first MP3 player!,"Apple 1 GB iPod Shuffle AAC/MP3 Player Pink (2nd Generation)This is my first MP3 player and I love it! It can have over 200 songs and it is smaller than a credit card! It clips to your shirt, easy to use and the pink color is cute! For beginners, this is a perfect product."
5,It's the user not the player.,"I've read some reviews for this product; and in general reviewers who give this product a low rating must struggle with setting the time on their VCR's (yes the phrase is somewhat antiquated now)Simple iTunes interface - want a song on your iPod? drag, drop, done.I like the durability of this product, it's sleek, it's small - a bit easy to lose, but it's a double edged sword when it comes to all of this modern micro-technologies.I get 15 hours out of this player on a single charge - more than enough time for me; charging is a snap, it just sits right on it's little dock. Plug it in, go to bed - wake up, grab, and go - you have 15 hours of decent quality music (I'd say an 8 out of 10 quality-wise)If you have trouble understanding the basics of iTunes and creating playlists - then go back to CD's - when it comes to MP3 players iPod + iTunes is the easiest way to go."
2,Never received,I never actually received this product. It was lost by the USPS and the merchant had no more items in stock. She did however promptly refund the full purchase price as well as postage. So from that perspective things with this purchase went as well as they possibly could have given that I never actually got the ipod.
2,the earphone was wrong,"the product is not so good as before was, the earphone was wrong, and dont bring the earphone cover"
5,Susan's iPOD Shuffle,I absolutely LOVE this product. I had another type MP3 player that I had gotten for Christmas that was manufactured by Nextar. The player did not last 2 months and the company would not stand behind it.I am very happy with my IPOD!
4,iPod Shuffle review,"Battery life is good, am happy so far.Only wish it had some sort of display (probably asking for too much)!I just love the shuffle."
3,Not user-friendly or easy to learn,"If you are new to the MP3 player technology, this is NOT, I repeat, NOT A GOOD PRODUCT FOR YOU. This player is only for those who already own and use an MP3 player. This is important because the Shuffle has no labels and its small size (book of matches) necessetates your finger instinctively jumping to the ""Forward"" or ""Back"" button as it is too small to see. Also, there are no song labels so you pretty much have to either know what you have downloaded, be willing to scroll through or frequently change the songs. Regardless, this was my first MP3 player and I still have yet to figure out how to use it."
3,Not bad,"I recently got this item for my sister back in India. The product is really cool, especially the size - very compact. But you don't have any control other than turning the shuffle on or off. If you really want to select songs u wanna ply, you have to go for players with a display and to fit into a <100$ budget - u definitely cannot choose apple. Also the left ear phone produces some crackling sound often which is annoying at times. But I don't know if the warranty would hold good in India. So if u r buying this for someone overseas, think twice ... check the product if its absolutely fine before sending it over."
1,broke within the first use,"Setup was so simple:* Plug it in and charge.* Install the upgrades.* Sync your music.Unfortunately, within the first hour it became permanently hosed. No music, just a blinking light. No luck trying to resync, clear and start over, or anything else. A visit to my local Apple store and I could wait 6 hours to talk to somebody to accept my faulty unit or I could pay more to schedule ahead of time (preferred customer).That makes three dead iPods. I wish I could take my music to another platform...damn DRM."
2,Two strikes against the Shuffle,"I purchased the IPOD shuffle as a birthday present for my son. Within 24 hours it had ceased to work. While connected to the PC with the power adapter, it became super hot. I returned it and got a new one.The new one worked fine for about a week. Then my son started hearing a popping noise through his earphones. Thinking the phones were just bad, we swapped it out with another set of phones we had ... but the problem persists. I'm guessing the jack is bad this time.With all the good reviews, I guess the problems I'm having are rare, but c'mon. I'll be returning the second one tonight, and I have to tell you ... three strikes and you're out IPOD Shuffle."
4,Perfect devise for me.,If you don't care to watch videos but want to listen to music on the go this product is perfect for you.
4,Good book for beginners,"Dear Sirs,This is good book for those who are interested in African art but not very deeply. It is kind of catalogue which gives you a list and discription of general topics in tribe by tribe art.I would recomend it for beginners in African art and culture."
5,Good Reading,Excellant book. Would recommend this for art collectors and history enthusiasts everywhere. A good source of information on the various tribes in Africa.
1,NOT pack of 12!! Misrepresented,"I was one click away from submitting the order, but had a question and called Rawlings customer support. Was shocked (lucky) to find out that the offer was for a single ball, NOT a pack of 12 - as stated on the Amazon offer."
3,"good product, too easy","The product is excellently made, but I felt that it was too easy. I wan't something to help me become fluent, but felt that this product allowed me to become mildly conversational."
4,Good stuff for my peppers,"I started approximately 200 plants indoors and needless to say, after over three months under a growlight, they are in need of some nutrients. This Calcium supplement seemed to do the trick and they are looking healthier than ever. My only negative comment is the bottle is not the easiest to pour. . . but I'm clumsy."
1,Stopped working on the third use,"I discovered this hair dryer at a hotel and loved how strong it was, so was excited when I saw it on Amazon do cheap. This is a classic case of you get what you pay for. Literally on the third use, it just stopped working. I returned it right away."
2,Has some interesting ideas,This book has some interesting ideas but they do not fit my needs. Hope to find another one that will have more general ideas.
4,nice for the price,I was very happy with quality for the price. it was just a bit smaller than the picture appeared. It was very easy to assemble
3,IT WAS NOT RECEIVED IN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME,"ITEM WAS ORDERED ON DECEMBER 4, 2012, RECIEVED ON DECEMBER 29, 2012, , I WAS TOLD BETWEEN DECEMBER 13-18. I REALIZE THE STORM, BUT, THIS IS EXCESSIVE"
5,Great Piece of Furniture,"This was a Christmas gift for my wife and is a great addition to our bedroom collection. The finish is a red oak and matched perfectly to our bedroom furniture group. The piece arrived very timely and was well wrapped. Other comments referred to the package arriving damaged and the furniture being damaged as well. The box was within another box and was very well cushioned. The carton had protectors on every corner and it literally took me 10 minutes to get them all off and be able to open the box. The piece assembles very quickly and is a very high quality. Drawers are nicely lined in felt, move in/out easily. The top and mirror were well constructed and add a nice touch. The pull out sides offer lots of nice storage for necklaces. Overall this was a great buy! Good price, great shipping and high quality unit. A definite 5 start recommendation."
1,arrived damaged,My wife liked it but it had a giant scratch on the lid and the doors where coming off. Looks good put poor quality and I would not recommend it.
3,I'm sure it works for its intended purpose,"I bought this to remove a filter from a lens that i dropped - the filter had gotten dinged pretty good and was bent. I was hopeful that these would work to remove it but they didn't. I'm sure they work fine to remove filters that are just hard to get off - but don't buy them expecting them to remove a damaged filter that is crimped on the screw rings of the lens. Not saying they're a bad product, and i'll keep them in my camera bag to switch filters that are sticky from humidity, etc. But take your damaged stuck on filters to the camera shop - I broke my lens trying to get mine off."
3,Worked great...but only for THREE MONTHS,"I would not recommend this hair dryer since it only worked for three months. It was purchased in August and now, in November, it will not turn on.However, if you are not as unfortunate as I am, this simple hair dryer is very surprisingly quiet and gets the job done very nicely."
3,It's okay-maybe?,"I bought this item based upon the reviews found here at Amazon. Yes, it is small and powerful, easily carried. It is just about right, almost.From day one the bearings sound like they are going out. Did I get a defective unit? If yours sounds like mine, you are wondering when it will be going out. But it still works so I keep using it. Does the ""going out sound"" bother us. You bet it does!UPDATED: 12-30-2008Yep, it did go out about a week ago, so the sounds were the prelude of a unit wearing itself out. Only lasted several months."
3,Andis 40055 Pro Style 1600 Hair Dryer,The hair dryer runs a little hotter than I wanted. Otherwise it is a good dryer for those who want a less powerful hair dryer.
5,You won't believe it if you don't read it,"I bought that book mainly because it was awarded best book of 1999 by the British Chess Association. After reading first first few chapters I was amazed: there is many great chess books on strategy, but how many have examples from the very recent matches? As John Watson himself says, chess has evolved in last 70 years, so I am not finding books using 20 or 30 years old examples half as useful. Understand Nimzovitsch's My System as ""Old Testament"", and convert to new one . This is a book I am in love with, now I can sell all my others. Buy it and share beauty of Mr.Watsons brilliant work. I wish I could congratulate him personally."
2,Useful compilation,"A lot of chess is both rule based (positional) and calculation based (tactical). What Watson and others (Purdy, Soltis, Hubner) point out is that at any given position, you can have one or the other element dominate, oftentimes it's the tactical element in a seemingly winning position (i.e. 'defense' in a 'lost' position). The rule of thumb is that the stronger player will find a way to win. The reason computers are so good at chess is that they largely ignore positional understanding for tactics--and it works. This is the basis for anti-positional chess like Steinitz played. So keep a fresh eye.I never like a book that has cult status, like Niemzovitch's or Stilman's book, so I give this useful book 2 stars."
5,Fulani takes her readers on a wonderful journey.,"Seasons...is a great book for anyone interested in the culture and history of Blacks in England, and especially for readers who are familiar with Jamaican dialect. The story unfolds as told by a master story-teller and Fulani's use of Jamaican patois is so realistic that the dialogue echoes out loud from the pages adding a rich cultural dimension to the characters. There's something for everyone in this book: love, sex (not gratuitous or explicit, though), drama, mental illness, racial conflict and social consciousness. The context for all of these themes is an intriguing story of a young woman whose examination of her family's migration from a small Caribbean village to England in search of material well-being ultimately leads her back to her roots in Jamaica. I loved the book and eagerly look for more to come from this promising new writer."
2,"Well meaning, but not very good.","With all do respect to the author, I still cannot figure out what the purpose of this book is. I found myself bored after 12 pages. Means well, but this book does not deliver. You will get a far better education, understanding, insight, and better read by purchasing ""Noah's Ark: Fable or Fact?"" By Violet Cummings. I write this with the utmost respect."
5,Gang of Four @ The BBC,A Rare Thing is a Bad (John)Peel Session. Many of the Peel sessions released on vinyl (in the 80s) or on CD since have went out of print and become collector's gold.This session or Sessions (there are 3 here) are pure quality Gang of Four. 2 Sessions from 1979 and one from 1981 (just before Dave Allen departed) show the band at it's peak.Every track here is worth a listen. Find this and Buy it.
2,Me and Bobby D and a book deal makes three....,"This book was published during the highly anticipated (and just as highly-disappointed) bio-pic on Bobby Darin was being released. Undoubtly Steve Karmen was a good friend of Bobby Darin's and this story is intended to take the reader along on a fateful summer as the two head out to promote Bob's latest song (Rock Island Line) and find fame and fortune in a nightclub. Although the story may be true, Karmen seems to want to reflect more about his being delegated to the back of the band rather than put more into the real character of Darin. From what I have read, Karmen was there during the real formative years of Darin's career, but I felt like he was telling only part of the story here."
1,wrong item,i was sent the wrong item which the company that sent it to me blamedamazon.com for the mishap
4,finally--free of annoying dj banter!,"finally we're getting high-quality versions of madonna's post-immaculate videos. finally we get to witness the brilliant cinematography of 'i want you' (oh, wait, that was axed), 'deeper and deeper' (oops, didn't make the cut), and 'you'll see' (wrong again--is a trend developing?)...okay, okay, they're brilliant, and they were left off the video for less-than-brilliant stuff like 'beautiful stranger' and 'love don't live here anymore'. but at least they didn't cut 'bad girl', which by itself is worth the price of the collection (i consider it the best short music video ever). and, along with 'bedtime story' and 'human nature', at least you have some of madonna's best eye-candy to keep yourself occupied..."
4,An evolution through the 90's,"The video content is great, although I dislike Love Don't Live and Human Nature. This video collection shows us the evolution of Madonna's style in the 90's. But, I wonder why I Want You, Deeper And Deeper, Erotica and This Used To Be My Playground were NOT included. If I've had thought about it, I would put 3 stars instead of 4. By the way, if you are a huge Maddie fan (as I am) you'll love it anyway."
4,"there are 2 videos missed, a little bit disappointed.","where are ""i want you"" and ""you'll see"" She's so gorgeous and clamarous in the classic one ""you'll see"" i'm a little bit disappointed!"
2,it should have been 90:99 not 93:99,"i love the videos in this collection but there's some videos missing from this dvd, this dvd only included the following videosbad girlfeverrainsecrettake a bowbedtime storieshuman naturelove dont live here anymorefrozenray of lightpower of goodbyesubstitute for lovenothing really mattersbeautiful strangervideos not included in this collectionjustify my lovevoguehanky pankythis used to be my playgrounderoticadeeper and deeperi want youi'll rememberdon't cry for me argentinayou must love mebye bye babyyou'll seefrom evitabuenos airessuite case in another hall"
4,"People, look at the video's title!","All you people complain about the lacking of ""Erotica"" and ""Deeper And Deeper"". Well, I miss them as well. But look at the title of Maddie's (by the way great) collection: it says ""93:99"", and ""Erotica"" and ""Deeper..."" WERE RELEASED IN 1992! But there's still the question: Why the hell didn't Maddie release a ""92:99"" video collection! I don't see any reasonable reasons because in the other way, all her videos from ""Erotica"" could've been included. (And ""Erotica"" and ""Deeper And Deeper"" in fact had much more success than, for example, ""Bad Girl"" - but nevertheless, the latter is a terrific video! )"
3,Gimme More,"The quality and visuals are excellent in what is presented, but this is not the true collection. Not even close. Madonna felt the need to leave out many videos that deserved to be included, why she did this is a mystery.Having said that, what should be released is a definitive complete collection of all her videos to date, 2008. Every last one with a decent menu option available.What appears to have happened for this video series is Madonna picking and choosing what videos she felt defined the 90's, not what her fans wanted. This item is good for the Madonna collection but leaves many things out. Next time they better include everything."
3,Incomplete (Part 2),"I don't understand why I can't find in this video collection the following videos: ""Erotica"", ""Deeper and Deeper"", ""This Used To Be My Playground"", ""I'll Remember"", ""I Want You"", ""You Must Love Me"" and ""You'll See"". Has Madonna ever said something about it? This video collection would've been 5 stars if they had included (some of) them.Don't get me wrong, the videos here are really good, but it's like eating a piece of chocolate cake with no cherry on the top. What happened Madonna? You know it's not fair."
5,a stunning collection,"Madonna took a giant leap forward in making her videos in the 90's. Every clip was unique, and collected together, it's actually quite amazing to think all these videos are from the same artist. Talk about ""reinvention"". No one has done it better than Madonna. More than a few of the most striking videos of our time have come from her. Excellent!"
2,Boring and missing the hilites,It's missing Erotica -- which means that it is *unpurchasable* -- a puritan/victorian decision made for us by the record/dvd companies (thank you for watching *my* moriality* -- *plegh*). Some of the video transfers (DVD version) were jerky. Definitely not one of the higher quality collections.
1,OUCH!,"Maybe they get better later ... in ten years or so ... but for now, nothing could even start to describe this product. I'm not talking about their service, but the actual coverage itself isn't good. You will be very disappointed when it's already too late!It will cost you WAY MORE THAN OTHER COMPANIES TO CANCEL so make sure you're keeping it for at least a year!"
1,Useless,"This was a disappointing purchase. Written for a 3 year old reading level, the 'book' was mostly filler - useless stories and personal anecdotes.The only useful information could have been presented in a 3 page brochure. There were 4 versions of the same exercise, with an embarrassing display of graphics.The author should stick to his first profession."
2,Could work for some,"Interesting facts in this book, but errors, too. The most serious error is the assumption that multifidus will tag along automatically. For those that it will, this might work perfectly. However, I've understood that it is for some of us absolutely critical to learn to voluntarily contract our low back multifidus as well. And that important part is missing in this book. (In my case the right side multifidi in my lower apparently didn't kick in during light activities for 8 years. When I was taught to voluntarily contract the multifidi they started contributing. This fact is based on scientific studies and you can check it e.g. inTherapeutic Exercise for Lumbopelvic Stabilization: A Motor Control Approach for the Treatment and Prevention of Low Back Pain)I would recommend Rick Jemmett's book on Spinal Stabilization instead. That is a buy you won't regret!"
4,Back exercise,"This book presents a very simple exercise program to strengthen the major muscles that stabilize the low back and the scientific rationale for doing so. I would recommend the exercises program as good first step for those with low back pain. If however a person has malalignment issues of the low back, hips or pelvis I do't think it will be enough. I would also consider a postural alignment exercise program."
5,A Welcome Addition to LDS Children's Literature,"Ever since Brigham Young sent a handful of men and women on ""art missions"" to Europe back in the 1870's, the Latter-Day Saints have sought to produce art worthy of their faith. This wonderful book is among the best examples I have seen of what great things can happen when faith and art are blended to tell our stories. There is not a wasted word -- the text is, to paraphrase Matthew Cowley, beautfully simple, and simply beautiful. The accompanying artwork is the best I have ever seen in a children's book directed at the LDS market: Barrett's style is reminscent of the work of award-wining children's illustrator Jerry Pickney, rich in color, texture, and detail.This book deserves a place on the shelf of every Latter-Day Saint home. It is a remarkably moving work."
5,Very Good,the book is very well written and the author knows a lot about Telecommunications. It has a lot of schemes and charts which can help learners for better understanding of this issue. i can highly recommend this book.
1,Non-Functional,"This product is also sold under the brand name subsidary ""Game Mill Publishing"" through Officemax stores. I have been unable to get it to function. There is no phone number or postal address for contact, just a very limited website with no downloadable updates or FAQ, just a brief message that states ""Do not return the product to the store, send us an email describing the problem and we will reply with a link to the solution"", I have attempted contacting them 3 times over 3 weeks with no response. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! IT DOES NOT WORK!!!"
1,Correction to Mr. Marchetti,"Mr. Marchetti has confused the Department of Commerce, a department of the federal government, with the Chamber of Commerce, a private business trade group. One wonders what the Chamber was trying to accomplish in publishing this misleading book. Is the subtext that all environmentalists are crackpots? If not, they should try to do something constructive. I think it is sad that they put their money and energy into such a negative effort."
1,Wrong Book,I received the wrong book. I tried to contact the seller through Amazon but wasn't able to find a way to contact them. I then went to Google and found their website and contacted the seller via email. I never even received a reply. I'm not happy. This is poor customer service on two counts. It would have been an easy correction.
4,Another Outstanding Album For Le Tigre,"If you are a fan of Le Tigre, you'll this latest edition of their off-beat style of music. I originaly fell in love with the band while watching the movie ""Better Luck Tomorrow."" Their song ""Let's Run"" is what originally drew me to the band. A nice alternative to most of the drab music on the radio."
4,"Okay, but I still love 'em!","Though I enjoyed their first CD, which I believe has a more real and uncut version of them. It's like they are not held back by some half brained producer in the studio, unlike this album. If this is your first purchase of Le Tegre, I would highly advise you to not judge them solely on this album.True, they are one of my all time favorite girl-riot-true-uninhibited bands out there today, I am a critic. It seemed like to me that a few of the songs, were just thrown together to get the album out there. But a lot of the songs are so intricate and unique one of a kind, thus is why I even bothered with this purchase.Here's a list of songs from this album that I think everyone will enjoy:* Tres Bein* Keep on livin'* Fake French* Dyke March 2001Keep in mind, I do have an aquired taste, and among the pickiest of listeners."
3,disappointing,"triteoversimplification of ""Man and Woman He Created Them: A Theology Of The Body"" by John Paul IIAfter a live two hour presentation of hype I expected more; I shall not make that mistake again with this author. Chris is charismatic, engaging, but short on substance in word and print.Spend your time reading the second edition translation of the original work.. unless you are fluent in Italian.For better results first read ""Love and Responsibility by Pope JohnPaul II"" Both JPII works are accessible to those capable of reading the catechism without trauma.edit: unredacted. zero-affiliate amazon URLs replaced with book title and author"
2,Not for me!,"I have been using the Moi razer for about a month. I have tried wet, I have tried dry, I have tried with and without shaving gel I can't seem to get a close shave. It really looks like I haven't shaved when I am finished. I am very disappointed and would not recommend."
1,Does it even have a blade?,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas - she says, ""It is the worst electric razor I've ever had. It fits well in your hand but it does not even start to shave closely. I would not recommend this razor at all."""
1,this is the worst thing you can buy,this is the most unbeliveable peace of crap i have ever bought and i buy alot of stuff....First of all after a few months the thing stop working and water was leaking from the back... I call Haier and they sent me another one and told me to get rid of the old one (wich was three months old) So the next one came and that work for two months I called and they sent me another one and told me to get rid of that one..... Then three months later that one stop working i was like what the @#$&! man.. This things get clog up and the back drain dose not drain anything even if you tilt the dam thing...... So now I have three brand new looking not working water dispenser... You are better off drinking from the sink DONT DO IT
1,Disaster,"I received this water cooler a week after ordering and it never worked. The compressor went on but never cooled the water. After doing what was instructed by Haier, sending in copies of receipts multiple times, it is now almost 90 days later and after 17 phone calls I still don't have my replacement. Their customer service is by far the worst, most inadequate I have ever experienced in my life. I will NEVER buy a Haier product again; I don't care what the reviews are or how good their products may be. They know nothing about customer service."
2,"Hot Water stopped working, Flimsy Construction","The main reason this product gets 2 stars from me: the hot water heater stopped working about six weeks after I set it up. It was just outside the Amazon 30-day return window, but they took it back anyway (Thanks Amazon!).However, I wasn't thrilled with it when it was working properly. The dispenser unit functioned OK - cold water was cold, hot was hot - but the workmanship was poor. The base was difficult to assemble and didn't give me confidence that it would stay together. The door didn't open and close smoothly either.I plan to buy another cooler, but it won't be from Haier."
3,Plagued by dubious cliches,"Fine writing, but the facts are suspect. As an example, the chapter on bear attacks gives the usual spin that the odds of being killed in a car accident on your way to Yellowstone Park are greater than the odds of being killed by a grizzly in Yellowstone. Yeah, there's not much chance of encountering a grizzly in the vast parking lot at Old Faithful, but if you look at the rate of injuries from bears to hikers in Yellowstone's backcountry, it's readily apparent that people hiking in the backcountry are at far greater risk than people driving through the park in their Winnebago.I give this book 3 stars only because the author is very sincere and trys to give a balanced presentation. In terms of accuracy and relevant facts, the Grizzly Almanac gets 1 star."
2,Compass Watch,"I have gone through three of these watches. First one the battery dies in a year. The second one th3e case around the sensor cracked (making the watch fail.) Third one lasted three days and failed when I wore it in the shower. Either I have bad luck or this watch is not up to the ""outdoors"" standard. Final piece was on none of the three watches was the Altimeter ever even close."
5,Fantastic Watch!,"Watches are kinda like Flashlights.... I use this one all the time.. I Like the big Dial, Easy to see.. etc...Had it like 3+ years now,,,, Replaced BATTS on it, before too... Takes 2 Batts...Nice Device, Good for Camping too, and Travel/ Alaska again someday? / COMPASS TOO~!"
3,Almost there but not quite...,"Casio Men's Pathfinder Triple Sensor Altimeter/Barometer/Digital Compass Watch #PAG40-3VI got this watch because I wanted something different from what I had at the time. Because recently I've been outdoors a lot, having a watch with built in compass seemed like a great idea. Having barometer and altimeter on top of it was a great bonus, so I thought. My impressions of the watch are generally positive. The compass works that way it is advertised so I got what I wanted. However, the 'extra' bonus seems to be very problematic. Here is my advise to anyone buying it: do NOT trust the altimeter. I think that this watch would do much better without it. You might have as much luck in throwing a rock at a flying plane as with this watch getting a correct altimeter reading."
2,it keeps time well...,"I STILL think casio g-shocks are the best watches. But my last two experiences have not really been impressive. This watch has a nice BIG dial and you can even read the numbers without having to use the light (an improvement from the mudman version). As a pilot I thought it would be neat to have the barometer and altimeter. WRONG, well I guess it is cool to have ""random numbers"" generated, these functions are so far out of wack that it would be impossible to compare them to toys. Don't waste your money. I will use it until the battery dies (which will not be that long with ANY use - (read the small print)), and then look for a BASIC watch. I have learned my lesson."
4,A must have for GTK+/Gnome developers!,"I got this book about a week ago, have managed to read about 1/4, and all I can say is that it's GREAT! My priority is in GTK+ development and not in Gnome, but fortunately this book is not only for Gnome hackers. Chapters 1-3 give good information about GLib, GObject and GTK+, can't wait to read the Glade chapter!One small minus is that page numbers in Index are unaccurate, showing two pages bigger value where the content can actually be found.. Not a big problem, with this book and API documentation GTK+/Gnome development becomes much easier than before!!"
3,eh!,"this book is just eh!i was expecting this wonderful survey of nj, having read from journal articles by joanna burger.The book is a drag to read, although informative and containing subject matter not tackled by anyone else.having had dr. burger as a professor at rutgers, i would say read the book, don't take the class."
2,Computer Repair Book,This book was written for a laptop repair expert which is not I. I prefer Gookin's Laptops for Dummies.
1,wake up sunshine,I had this clock as a child and ordered it for my grandson who has trouble waking up in the morning. It arrived broken so we never got to use it. Be forewarned that I never received a refund because I checked the gift box during checkout. He didn't get anything either. I hope others enjoy the clock because Big Ben was a name we all trusted.
2,Jagged Edge,"I had the same ""jagged edge"" problem as another reviewer - instead of a perfect circle you get this cheap and crappy looking piece of gray paper jutting in from one side. It's a shame, because the design idea is beautiful."
2,Kickout Case Disappointment,"I ordered the cases knowing full well there was a production flaw in the clear plastic being milky. I was given the option to order specific trim colors so I chose black. I needed the trim to be black to go with the case graphics I had created. I was really surprised to receive blue cases instead. If they only had blue they should have informed me before sending them out. I found the cases at a late date and had to use them - there was no time for a return or to purchase from another source. On a positive note, they did arrive in a timely manner and there were no damages otherwise."
3,"Inspiring yes, helpful info - no","This book is inspiring and entertaining with uplifting stories of women affected by cancer. The only thing I found discouraging is that so many people facing cancer don't question some of the treatments they receive and do more digging into what is available, rather than just giving into the status quo and taking whatever their doctor gives them without question. I am an alternative medicine fan, so of course, I was hoping to see more accounts of women taking the initiative in this book and opting for more alternative treatments, which wasn't there. One reviewer mentioned breast cancer as possibly a ""gift of higher understanding,"" which I just don't see. As a matter of fact, I can't see any cancer as being a ""gift"" of any sort."
4,A worthwhile buy,"The first time I saw this publication was on a book fair in So Paulo and I found it amazing from the very first moment. I bought it from Amazon some weeks later and it really paid its value.It covers the story behind each building that have become world famous landmarks.You can go directly to a specific building you're interested in or read it throughly from beginning to end. Both ways you'll be pleased and surprised with the information provided.The only thing that disappointed me was the very little coverage on South American landcaspes such as Machu Pich ruins Oscar Nyemeyer's BrasíliaHowever, it's an excelente book anyway. If you do appreciate good architecture, you won't regret buying it."
5,The One to Read About Jonathan Jay Pollard,"This is an excellent book about a most unusual espionage case. I believe that Wolf Blitzer deserves a great deal of praise both for his writing style and the quality of his research.Bottom Line: Pollard was a venal, mixed up person who cheerfully betrayed his country for money. My impression from reading a recent Seymour Hersh article about Pollard is that the ""I did it for Israel"" excuse is a convenient afterthought. He should stay in jail...But if it is necessary to release him in order to cajole some future Israeli government into a peace accord with the Palestinians, I could live with that. We should just revoke his citizenship before letting him make ""aliyah"" (emigration) to Israel. Personally, I'd like to see him sent there via a giant slingshot (like the way Dilbert gets periodically sent to Elbonia)."
5,refreshing,"Ceramics is an amazing piece of work. The album as a whole is destructive yet beautiful, and must be listened to at maximum volume to fully appreciate. This is attention to detail, served in a form that breaks and leaps in near chaos. The result is a very freeing experience."
3,A Wonderfully Out of Character Arditti Piece,"3 1/5 StarsI'll echo the previous reviewer's spot on insights, and simply say that you could actually get a worse Arditti mix-n-match cd (I'm thinking of the first Felder cd, also on the Bridge label). The Concerto's fun, but I will most certainly want to draw your attention to what I feel is a very sublime String Quartet by Mason. It's much friendlier than much Arditti-fodder, and by that I mean that it has a jaunty jallopy, scenic tour flavor to it that is not in the least bit obvious (compared to, say, Nyman). The Ardittis sure KNOW how to play nice, it's just that no one seems to want to write nice for them. And please don't get hooked up on me using the word 'nice'; if you need an immediate reference, the general flavor of another Arditti disc, 'California Composers', comes close. Get it cheap!"
5,Henry and Co.'s best album.,"First of all, hats off to Theo Van Rock and Peter Rave for producing and engineering this album-- as far as sound quality goes (especially Melvin Gibb's bass) this is in the top 5 albums of all times.Beyond that, this album is the finest Rollin's band album yet and it even surpasses much of Henry's work with Black Flag. But surprisingly, dispite the band's name, Henry is overshadowed by the excellent work of the rest of the band on this album. The band always sounds tight as hell with their not holds barred approach to recording. Sim Cain holds his own on drums dispite Henry's vocals, Chris Haskett's hard, funky, at times almost Hendrixian guitar stylings, along with Melvin Gibb's bass (gotta love that wah-wah on ""Shine"")."
5,probably the most powerful song written.....,"I can't help but feel the power off this song...I know what it's about, and that makes it even more important.You can't beat this, pure emotion..............."
3,different than before,I recently purchased these online after having enjoyed the tin I got at a Tea shop. The mints were different!!! It was like the company used a different formula. One reviewer mentions the ability to chew the mints... I wasn't able to chew them anymore as they were a lot harder and less grainy.
1,Horribly Depressing!,"I really love the Senior Year series, but this book just made me so mad! If you read it you will know why. All I can say is: Liz deserves so much better. I guess there is still a part of me that wants Liz and Conner to get back together, but then there are books like WWB that make me hate Conner. He is such a jerk! But, the Maria and Ken parts were good, though I thought that was almost more of a secondary story line, contrary to the book cover. It wasn't like the book was bad, but the plot line ruined any enthusiasm I had for the book. I hope Close to You is better."
5,What a voice....,"Andrea Folan has one of the most gorgeous voices I have ever heard....it's full of warmth and caresses each note so effortlessly. Between her and Thomas Behgin, each lied is presented with much though and flawless execution."
5,Weeping Violins,"Fascinating account of what happened to the Romani gypsies of Eastern Europe and beyond during WWII. Very little has been recorded in history of these people during the war years of 1933-1945. I was spell bound by this book, and could not put it down. Harrowing accounts of crimes against humanity,litter the pages of this phenomenom of history. I recommend this to anyone who studies the holocaustof World War II."
3,Three Coins In A Fountain,"When lovelorn Gina Hart recklessly wished to become a nun, the last thing she expected was to immediately meet a rich, handsome, eligible bachelor! But there before her was Jackson Maxwell Covington III, offering her his arm and escorting her to a party so elegant it put Cinderella's ball to shame. Gina's next wish was for the night to last forever - but though she fit perfectly in Jackson's arms, what would he think when he found out her secret? Could they turn on night of passion into the love of a lifetime?"
1,broken after using about two month,"what you pay is what you get.. it's cheap.. so expect the quality of the product.it worked fine at first but eventually it's not working.when it works, it's good. it's light. easy to use for amature.but not happy because it's now broken.."
1,This book is for SMS 2.0,"I'm very dissappointed this book this book is not clearly listed as an SMS 2.0 book. Had I known it was for version 2.0 I would not have purchased it. I needed a book to help me with SMS 2003 patch deployment and this book has nothing in it to help me. It has only 19 pages which talk about SMS 2003 in a chapter called ""Things to Come""."
5,"Seminal thoughtpiece, masterfully written","This book offers brilliant and carefully argued insights into the nexus of relations that the title suggests. Homer-Dixon has made a case for environmental conern all the more powerful by steering away from the dogmatism that so often accompanies such work. Instead, he has presented a book that is the result of years of academic research in a way that anyone will enjoy reading it. Homer-Dixon is a great writer who knows an enormous amount about this subject and has as a result written an incredible book. Buy it! Read it! Get your professor to put it on the core reading list of any course about world politics, international relations, environment, and more!"
3,Le Creuset Cookbook,"As far as the cookbook, it is definitely not designed for an American diet. There are few main dishes that I will use from the cookbook, as I don't readily have access to hare, sweetbreads, and some fish and birds I have never heard of. I am not unhappy that I bought it, as it gives techniques that are compatable with foods I do cook.I have to share...(My LeCrueset dutch oven is the absolute best purchase I have ever made when it comes to kitchenware. I have made many delicious meals in it and it never fails to cook to perfection, and it keeps the meal warm (without overcooking it) for around an hour, if your meal has to be delayed. I can't believe I have been cooking for 33 years without this wonderful dutch oven. You gotta get one!!)"
4,the 2000 year old man,I saw it when it aired originally aired but I thought it was longer than 30 minutes.
2,Disappointing,"Skies & Clouds by Richard Taylor is disappointing. Beginners should find the text instructive and techniques not intimidating, but the examples contain many errors (often according to his own advice) making them counter productive to the student aspiring to greater proficiency. The author demonstrates merely modest painting ability of the subject. Regretfully the lighting and shadows are not well rendered and contrast values are weak. His clouds are overly ephemeral with little structure. A watercolor of a ""Sky and Sea"" is the most convincing, because the waves of the sea are well rendered, but the sky is confused with fog and rays of light that look like rain. The book's purpose of being a ""field guide"" to aid in the artists perception of nature is good, but a more observant eye and commentary is desirable. The watercolors display visual paint textures but fall short of being inspiring Skies or Clouds."
4,No more scars,"I purchased this after getting turf burn from sliding on artificial turf in a softball game. I wish it was longer to get better coverage, but I just wear tall socks to cover the rest of my leg. I have to adjust the pad periodically through a game and especially after a slide. If you are just looking for something to cover up your skin during a slide, this works great. If you are expecting something more like a brace, then this is not for you. As for longevity, it has lasted a season on turf. It seems sturdy enough to last on other surfaces as well."
3,Good product BUT ONLY ONE PAD...I have two knees...,it's a good product but only one knee pad which I'm sure makes sense to some folks but to me was not easy to spot on their advertisement nor could I comprehend knee pads sold individually...so...WATCH OUT BI-KNEE'D PEOPLES!
5,Bible Stories for Children,"I purchased this book in February, 1989 and have read it cover to cover at least six times for each of my three children. It is the best children's Bible that I have found. Children are interested as early as 3-4 and remain interested through 10-12. It is outstanding. I recommend reading from start to end, two chapters per night. It is well illustrated, Biblically sound, and well written with appropriate size print. Enjoy and God Bless. Makes a wonderful Christmas Gift."
1,Junk,"I bought 2 but didn't open them right away, big mistake. They were junk. Bulbs were broken, didn't work and they were no longer returnable. I learned a big lesson to open things right away! The tooth brush slots are VERY small as well."
4,"My kids love it, but its short for the money!","i was able to get this with free super saver shipping from a third party so i paid a 1/3 of what amazon is asking, therefore i feel it was a fair price, but i would probably would have felt a little disappointed had i of paid full price. the movie is super cute and it tells you how each of the furious five(snake, mantis, tigeress, monkey, crane) all became the super heroes they are through the storytelling of panda. panda is in charge of teaching a new generations of kids(bunnies) the art of kung fu and he starts by telling them how their heroes became masters of kung fu. the movie is only 24 minutes which is think isnt long enough to be asking almost the full price of a normal dvd. if you can get this at a discount i would say go for it if your kids love it. mine do and theyve watched this over and over."
2,More headache than it's worth,"I bought this item primarily for a medical database. Even though I purchased the extended warranty, I had trouble with the issue of who is supposed to service it - is it HP or the company that offered the warranty. The power button would not work properly to turn the unit on or off. Neither party was too helpful."
5,Great Camera!!!!,I bought this camera over two years ago and it still works as good as when I first bought it. Great picture quality and easy to use. Some features can be pretty hard to understand but those features you only need to mess with if your a pro. Just charge it and go. Great Product!!!!
2,Stale!,"I have ordered these several times and they've been fine, however, this time they are stale! It is within the expiration date but perhaps improperly handled?"
4,Works great...,"This is a very light cutter, and kind of feels flimsy, but as long as you have a solid grip on the item it works great."
2,...don't make a Big Country mistake...,"...hi, not a review , just wanted to advise all fans of Big Country's Stuart Adamson , that this cd's is by a completely different guy. This guy is big on country for sure, but he is an american country artist. I nearly made the mistake of buying this,as Amazon have it connected to Big Country,The Skids and the Raphaels. Just for your information people. Stay Alive ."
1,Are you kidding me?,"If you had the world's most exciting story to tell, rich with pirate lore, New England history and treasure excavation would you spend an entire chapter talking about your high school and junior college football career? Mr Clifford has excavated the world's first pirate ship and belittled the act by penning a self-promoting, opportunistic, poorly-written account of his involvement with the Wydah expedition. Though it is peppered with interesting history and unique insight about the salvage trade, the story degrades into a petty attack on crew members and endless complaints about the ""interfering"" academics and authorities. I started reading with a keen interest and open mind, but the story leaves you skeptical about Mr Clifford's honesty and integrity (why are there several pictures of the late JFK Jr. if he only spent one summer of the 10+ years of excavation?) I am going to read Kiesling's book to get the other side of the story."
4,Not just for nonfiction lovers.,"This book was selected for my monthly book club and I was a little down about it, but Mr. Clifford won me over soon enough. The two stories that run side by side in this book are a wonderful, romantic adventure. After being forced to pick it up, I loved it so much I'm wearing the T-Shirt. Don't let the nonfiction archeology lead you away from this book, which is really a romance with and in the past."
2,"Big, Gold [toned] and Bold...but no reserve!","EDIT: I would upgrade the gold stars to a 3.5 if I could...but I haven't figured out how ;-(I've had this automatic for 7 months now...it is a big, flashy piece, so be prepared...not for the faint of heart!!One caveat: the reserve on this watch is not good, and you will probably have to wear it all of the time, at least based on my experience. Even when I use a winder, it stops ticking after only about 5 hours after I take the watch off. [Most of my automatics have at least a day's reserve, in contrast].So, if you like bling, and are willing to wear it all of the time, this watch may work for you...otherwise...EDIT 8/23/09: Lately, I've been getting more in touch with my inner ""bling""...and wearing this watch on a daily basis; the upshot: the reserve seems to get better with usage, and it can go more than 24 hours on the shelf...interesting and welcome!"
4,Different But Definitely Held My Interest,This shaggy dog story is ok by me! I thought the lessons in physics and quantum theory refreshing. My interest was kept alive and well with what Jury's investigation might find. The old familiar characters were welcome and seemed to fit comfortably within this strange story. Very creative.
1,Can't Believe This Book!,"Can't believe this book could have been written by a recommended and established author! Had to betake myself to peer reviews to make sure it wasn't only me. If you read the one and two star reviews shown here they express my sentiments exactly. This was my first Martha Grimes book. Can Martha Grimes write good mysteries? I hope I will give her a second chance in the future.PS: If you do decide to read the book, let me clarify - no! the printer did not leave any end pages out!"
1,I enjoyed the early Richard Jury books,but couldn't get beyond fifty pages of this one before giving up. What has happened to Martha Grimes? Or is her publisher pushing her to produce faster than she can think up a decent plot and characters more interesting than cute kids and dogs?
4,This one will make you think,"If you're a fan of quantum theory (and who isn't...?), this Drury is for you. Grimes mixes the uncertainty theory of Heisenberg with a good 'n tense mystery (or two) and comes up with another out of the box reading experience. If you're looking for a formulaic mystery, you won't find it in these pages. And the ultimate uncertainty: will or won't Drury get his man? is one that will keep you guessing."
4,"Fun, but different!",A departure from previous cases. I missed Agatha and 'the gang' - they had very little to do with the story. It kept my brain active trying to figure out just what was going on. Worth the read as always.
2,Who-done-It with No Answer.,"Martha Grimes should never have put THE OLD WINE SHADES in the Jury/Plant series. It betrays the genre of a detective who-done-it. If she wanted to move in another direction she should have given the characters & places new names, no one who have known the difference.The character of Harry Johnson and the dog Bingo has no substance. A drunk is a drunk even if he's sipping fine wines.Nash Black, writer."
2,Not Grimes usual best,"I have loved Martha Grimes books, but just sort of, not quite, liked this one. The inconsistencies, many and glaring, that another reviewer mentioned were extremely irritating. What I found most peculiar about this book is that everyone who heard this story was in total disbelief at what an extraordinary tale it was. Page 73...Melrose says ""that is the strangest story I have ever heard"". Page 76 Jury says ""The whole damned thing's fantastic. Page 95...Dr.Phyllis Nancy after hearing the story ""shakes her head in near disbelief"". It is an unfortunate and tragic reality that people go missing every day, and are never heard from again. Why in the world would a group of law enforcement people find this so strange and unbelievable? That and the many inconsistencies throughout the book, and the Mungo part made this book really difficult to finish."
2,"Pull the shades, the party's over.","I am conflicted here, because I am a long time reader of Martha Grimes Richard Jury mysteries. It is, undoubtedly difficult to keep the same characters fresh and the stories clever. But, I have a bit of a crush on Richard Jury, so I continue to plod through these books. The Old Wine Shades has many vintage Martha Grimes elements--oppressed, yet wise and brave children, round table discussions at the Jack and Hammer, Aunt Agatha scarfing down too many fairy cakes--but even these old dependables can't save this book. Sadly, the weak threads, lack luster dialogue compounded by a problem-solving dog and cat, along with a tedious science lesson, make the book unbearable for me. I've walked into my last pub with Richard Jury; I'm really going to miss him."
2,Grimes Lost The Plot,"A great plot concept falls flat on its face!What happened half way through? A body is found and the story becomes farcically and unbelievably, should I say, boring! So much research and clever twists gone to waste I'm afraid. I couldn't wait to finish it and start a safer Reginald Hill."
5,My Watch,"I've owned this watch now for 2 months. It is an amazing watch, great backlight, I wear long sleeves almost all day and it keeps a great charge. Time keeping is excellent, I lost 2 minutes in a month which is top notch. One downside to the watch is that its mainly a dressed up Casio which I didn't happen to notice apon ordering it. Other than that its great. Good leather band, classy look, automatically sets itself(NOTE: will only set off of GMT +4/5/6/7 also known as US east/central/mountain/west). I'm at GMT -3 so I had to manually set the watch but overall a 5 star product. Excellent shipping!"
5,awesome calculator,"This calculator is a very powerful tool, it will come in handy many years after receiving my degree. Well worth the money to buy it."
4,Good sampling,"This is actually a really nice sampling of the PT line-up. If you have a friend that doesn't know bout em, give em this cd and they will be certainly more familiar. I'm glad they put stars die on here, also colourflow mind is cool and so is phantoms (i really like the guitar effect on that one, and the lyric 'i look at all the sad storied people'). So basically it has some old some new and some blue (no borrowed since SW is retardedly original) Well maybe 1 borrowed - TSMS is a track that is heavy on the PFloyd influence, even SW says its true. Check it out, cool artwork also."
2,Crazy Hope,"The series started out with a bang and has hewed to the formula. It is a good formula, but my God, it soon gets very very hard to identify with a protagonist who is more than just a whiner or hard to like as other reviewers have noted: he borders on mentally ill. If you like the way his character navel-gazes and wrings his hands, stick with this series, there is more on the way.Addendum: It has been another few years and another few novel, and yes, our Hero is even crazier."
4,Thank goodness for this bag.,"I've been using this to wash my $50 Victoria Secret bras. I managed to squeeze two 36DD bras in it, so it does it's job. It keeps them safe from being bent and ripped, I'm happy with it."
2,Poor Quality,The zipper does not stay closed so your bra ends up falling out anyway. The inside lining has started coming unravelled and I have only used it twice! I do not recommend for anyone to buy.
2,Unzips,"It's a nice size, but EVERY time I wash it, it unzips and everything comes out of it. I live in a dorm, so maybe the wash machines are extra tough or something, but I think it should do a better job."
1,Ruined two bras,"Wow, these reviews certainly prove that everyone has different opinions! We currently use the bra baby at our house and it works great to protect the bras and get them smelling clean (something that is difficult to do when handwashing padded bras). However, as other reviewers have said, the bra baby fastener is made poorly and falls off. (We frequently find it in the bottom of the washer and manage to repair it for awhile.) We decided to try the bra wash bag and completely ruined two bras. They held their shape and were clean, but were snagged all over; on the cups and all around the band. We only washed them with t-shirts, so I can only assume that the snagging came from rubbing against the bag. We're getting ready to try to bra ball since it looks like a better made version of the bra baby. It is a shame that the bra baby makers can't just improve the fastener because it's a great product otherwise."
2,MEH,i bought this product hoping that it would keep my bras safe in the wash... i LOVED it the first couple of times... but after having it for 2 months... it doesnt always stay zipped :(the picture shows 2 bras in it... but i can only fit 1 victoria's secret underwire bras :(i am going to keep using it until it breaks but the unzipping part is very upsetting.
3,"Pretty good, except the zipper is a pain","The bag works great, however sometimes the zipper comes open during the wash if I don't push it down enough."
2,bummed bit I still use these,"the zippers on these bags always break in the wash. I have to use these, my bras have large size under wires that need protection and I have to safetypin these shut everytime I use them."
3,Wash Bag Review,"This bag worked well the first time. However, on the 2nd use the plastic insert (that keeps the bag from depressing in the washing machine) bent. This plastic insert is the only protection that under-wire bras have during the wash/spin cycle to keep from becoming misshapen. I wish that I could give this item a better review because it seemed to work so well initially."
3,Good information marred by conclusions & poor writing style,"After read Eric J. Lerner's excellent book ""The Big Bang Never Happened"" I was inspired to buy this book. After reading it I wanted to give a higher rating for this book because the detailed information supplied by William C. Mitchell, exposing the myth of the big bang, is truly excellent. Mr. Mitchell has written a very usefull and helpful book but because he fails to completely separate himself from the usual ""cosmology"" nonsense the book ends on a very sour note with his own theories which don't look all that different from the Big Bang nonsense. The last couple of chapters of this book would better have been left out completely. In addition, Mr. Mitchell is a less than able writer. This book badly needed an editor.I recommend this book as a usefull reference for those seeking to understand current cosmology discussion and as an expose of a lot of the nonsense about the Big Bang."
5,Great Little Camara!,"If your looking for a good, pocket type camara with a lot of features, look no more. This camara is great. I love the quality and the awesome size. The battery is great, it lasts for 360 shots! The controls are great to, and the LCD is huge. Its bigger than most camara LCDs. Is shoots great movies(for a digital camara) and it can also has a recording voice feature. I love all the shots i've taken, they are alot better than my previous camara(Konica Minolta XG). The camara has a good grip for such a compact camara. You can put it in your pocket and take it anywhere. If your looking for a small, take it anywhere camara, with good photo quality and long battery life this is the camara for you."
4,Small Sleek Camera Lacks Picture Quality,"Pros:-Very Small-Large Screen-Nice Button Layout-Durable-Nice Movie Quality-Tons of modes and featuresCons-Screen Smudges Easy-Picture Quality is not 4 MP's-Battery Drains FastThe Casio is a very nice camera and as a whole, I really enjoy it. However, the picture quality is really not as good as it could be and the pictures do not feel like 4 Mega Pixels for all the shots. If you are looking for a small camera with a decent photo this one may be a good call, however, the 5 MP version is not that much more money and may be a more bang for your buck!"
2,Great camera until you use it.,"Initially my thinking was how could you go wrong with this camera. The size, battery life, screen size, docking station, etc. are all exceptional for the money. I read the customer reviews. Most were positive. Sharper Image was selling the camera and it looked good in person. I went to the Casio website and looked at their sample 4 MP pictures. They looked great, so I made the purchase.The camera arrived. I anxiously opened the box and started playing around with it. It is a bit more complicated than I bargained for. I have played with most of the options and I spoke with Casio's technical support. Despite these attempts I continue to get grainy photos. I have owned a Kodak DX3900 3.1 Megapixel and the photos were half the file size and crystal clear.The bottom line is this camera does everything great except take pictures."
3,Next time it will be a Canon,"After reading many reviews and playing with many Canon Digi's of friends and relatives, Canon is much better in design and overall photo capturing quality compared to Casio. My Casio destroys many shots that others capture with no problem. Many are blurry, with poor color and digital noise."
3,Mixed feelings,"Positives:- good photos in good light conditions- quite small- nice, large display- quick start time- superb battery- lots of predefined settings, easy to use- uses cheap SD cards- build-in 9 MB of memory = 8 extra photos when you are out of space- good quality movies with sound - with 1 GB SD card ($50) you can forget about a separate video cam.- availability of underwater kit (expensive like hell!)Negatives:- quite fragile (broke one, fortunately had a replacement warranty and got another one for free)- photos in low light conditions are unacceptable - lots of noise- metal enclosure is very thin and delicate (Almond Joy's almond can easily dent it and damage the camera)- quite expensive - for the same price you can get a better camera from a better producer- buttons too small to use when in ski glovesOverall opinion - unless you get a great deal on this camera, better check offers from Nikon, Sony and Canon."
3,poor camera,"+ Long baterry life+ small size+ big lcd- Problems with colors (white balance) in auto setting- if you taking pix with AUTO , don't expect good, sharp or natural photo- to many functions/ really complicated"
3,Moderately Helpful,"This book did a fair job of preparing me for the test. I expected it to be more textbook style, however most of the book is just questions and answers from different versions of the test.It did help me prepare for the style that the test is written in, and I DID pass the test despite a limited knowledge on the subject prior to purchasing this product."
2,"Incomplete Details, and Missing Information","If you are looking to do some transmission work.... then buy another book.If you have a manual, there is a little info. If you have an auto... forget it.. there is almost no detail whatsoever.Information on the front calipers is almost non-existent if you have anything earlier than a 1990.An official workshop manual ? I think not !!!"
2,Inaccuracies...,"Although there are several wire diagrams in this book, inaccuracies exist. Try troubleshooting the LH control unit with the wrong pin numbers listed in this book....Not my idea of fun! Too bad, I though this would be the book I needed."
5,Saab 900 16 Valve Official Service Manual,I own two 1991 Saab 900's; one is a convertible and one is a coupe. I also own a 1988 Saab 900 convertible. I have reviewed this manual to assist me in replacing a transmission in the 1988 and replacing the convertible top and it's frame mechanisim. I also need to replace the timing belt on my 1991 convertible. The information provided in this manual will be the perfect assistance I need to guide me through the unique remove and repair process. Can't wait to get started.
4,Strictly for the pro,"As the description clearly indicates, this is the service manual for professionals. Period. It's as dry and detailed as as you would expect prose written by swedish auto engineers to be. There is nothing to read, no anecdotes nor unofficial tips or fixes. Use it if you are a black belt in mechanics or keep it in the trunk for the day a mechanic who doesn't know your car has to work on it. A buy for pros and for those who want to keep their vintage Saab for posterity."
5,Just the book I needed,"Just the book I needed to maintain my SAAB 900, clear and full of valuable information"
1,Don't make this your first Star Wars novel...,"...Or you'll never read another. I have been plowing through all the novels and this is by far one of the worst books I've ever read in my life. The other books in the series (with the exception of the Calrissian Trilogy) are among the best books I've ever read. The only reason I committed to finishing this one is because I'm on a quest to read all the Star Wars novels. This one was brutal. Too descriptive where it didn't need to be (ie author decides to up and describe some inanimate object which doesn't even help the story line along), not descriptive enough where it needs to be (ie author must assume you know what they were thinking when they wrote the book). If this had been the first book I read in the continuing Star Wars saga, I would never have picked up another."
1,"if you want something to do, eat crackers instead",You'll get more fiber. She didn't even do her homework and was calling half the things by different names! The only one I hate more is 'Splinter of the Mind's Eye
2,Yikes!,"This book is awful. One of the weirdest books I've ever read. This book has plenty of substance, just boring substance. This book takes way two long developing the theme of thisbook. The end is the only ""exciting"" part of the book. I wouldn't waste my money on this"
3,May the Duct Tape be with you?,"This book is weird. It is full of bad plots, silly situations, and a lot of campiness that seems unitentional. We have a ship roaming around the universe and converting Gamoreon guards into Stormtroopers, we have Luke falling in love with a ghost, and we have an author with a fetish for duct tape (at several points, people get captured so they can be bound and gagged with it.) And so it wanders on it's merry little way, content at being pointless, and delivers no payoff. Yet, at the end of it all, you're glad you read it. I can honestly say I can't remember why. All I can remember is the weirdness of it all. That, and the duct tape."
1,it should get negative 5 stars,i hated this book. the charaters were all gay. they should stop have affairs with eachother. but there was one good part. and that was the part with the flying coconuts. that part was pretty cool. and then when the army of flying rats came and started singing and dancing to some where over the rainbow i got so excited. but then i read the rest of the book and got very disappointed.
3,Okay but could have been better,"In the long line of Star Wars novels, ""Children"" is mediocre. It starts out with an interesting and suspenseful beginning that caused myself to wonder what was going to happen next. Once I found out what was going on though, I got bored. I am tired of seeing Luke not use his powers to his full capabilities. It is like every author is afraid to let him be the most powerful Jedi in the universe and kick some butt. However, the ending is the real disappointment. It is cut short with little detail and is anti-climatic. There is no nail-biting suspense and curiosity like the Zahn or Stackpole novels. Instead, the ending lets the novel fall flat. If you are a die-hard Star Wars fan, then read it. If not, skip it. It does not affect the continuity in any big way, so do not worry about missing it"
1,WHAT IN THE NAME OF GOD??????????????????????,"I absolutely hated this book. It was horrible. Please will someone tell me how Luke finds the Eye of Palpatine or when he falls in love with Callista? Was there a plot in this book? I couldn't understand one thing in the sections about Leia. The sections with Luke weren't that much better. In short, this book put me to sleep with its constant descriptions of Leia's dress. I usually love Star Wars novels. If anybody wants to read a real Star Wars story, read one of the books by Zahn or Anderson."
2,"Did I read it, or was I dreaming?","If you are not trying to read the Star Wars series in chronoligical order as I am, you may find this book interesting. I did not. The pace, compared to the books that preceeded this one was terribly slow and most of the time I had to re-read pages because I found my self in a fog. I don't want to compare this book to others in the series, because of the range different authors, but I think I have to if there is going to be any continuity in the ""big picture"" of the story as a whole. If you are reading the whole line of books, my advice to you is to skim it."
1,I am soooo annoyed with this book,"ok...luke and callista? HELLO, LUKE BELONGS WITH MARA JADE PLEEAASEEE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO AGREE W/ ME GO OUT AND READ VISION OF THE FUTURE AND SAVE YOURSELVES WHILE YOU CAN. the only reason i read this book is because i heard it has romance for luke, which is something he desperately needs. Yet luke, the protagonist and perpetual prude, needs a wild girl like mara jade not callista the ghosty ""nice girl"" (what the hell was that about--i'd like to think luke does not end up with such a weirdo) furthermore, i burst out laughing at the leader who says luke acts gay when he breaks his leg...he so does :) overall, this book has no plot and callista is so damn annoying. if u want luke to have a romance go read vision of the future and applaud timothy zahn for giving luke somebody who can actually show him a good time."
2,Too confusing,I read Children of the Jedi and really couldn't understarnd it. She didn't explain enough to really understand it and the plot could have been a lot better. Next time she really should take the time to explain things that are going on.
1,Would have made a great comic book,"This was an interesting story, but it would have made a better comic book or short story. We certainly did not need to waste time reading 400 pages of this. I feel bad for Hambly, but maybe she should read some Timothy Zahn books before she writes another Star Wars book."
2,Children of the Jedi is a horrible novel,"I thought this book was the worst I ever read. I wasted my time reading it. It made no sense what so ever. Where did this writer learn to write Star Wars novels.Children f the Jedi is a dumb title. I didn't like the character Callista, Luke deserves someone better. In some of the Star Wars novels I've read Luke meets better women that might suit him better besides this dumb Callista.But Luke never ends up with them.I thought some parts were good,but then it got boring again.I wasted my money.I wouldn't read it again!!!!!"
1,It's bad!!!,"This book is the worst Star Wars book I have ever read. I read Star Wars novels for enjoyment, not for improving my attention span. If I wanted to read a poor attempt at writing a figurative and classy novel I could read one of the suggested reading books my school gives me. I'm sorry, but this was torture."
1,Lost in Space !,"I truly wish I had not bothered to buy this book. At 11, perhaps I'm not old and literate enough to fully appreciate Hambly's work; though I did understand and moderately enjoy reading Planet of Twilight.I found it difficult to concentrate on this and at times, I even felt like skim-reading and skipping pages - something that I never thought I would feel like doing with a Star Wars novel. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone my age. You don't have read this to follow with the continuity of the other novels. All you need to know is:Boy meets Ghost. Boy and Ghost fall in love. Ghost becomes Girl. But Girl no longer has Ghostly powers. So Girl runs away from Boy. Boy goes looking for Girl. But Girl simply doesn't wany Boy anymore.Perhaps I'll come back to this in a couple of years but I'm not holding my breath. For now I think I'll stick to Zahn, Stackpole and Crispin."
4,Probably the best book out of the Star Wars series!,"This book is one of my favourite book of them all, because just for once someone managed to give Luke what he usually seems to lack: a sense of humour, and a good deal of sarcasm (and he is ever so wonderfully miserable). You can sense his frustration about the fact that he is once again stuck in an impossible situation, yet he takes it all at his pace, miraculously gets out alive and is rewarded with the love of Callista. Great! Barbara Hambly's humour is superb, so is the pace of the story and the fact that the characters involved get what they normally seem to lack: depth and humour (Han excluded - he always makes me laugh!)."
2,"Instead of nipples, I saw a flower and a circle. Thanks.","They are comfortable and seemed like they would stay on, and didn't tug skin or *anything* when I peeled them off...BUT! Instead of poking nipples I saw the flower-shaped outline and an even worse circle inside. VERY noticeable even under a shirt with which I could go bra-less without nipple showage. Would NEVER work under something sheer (like most new *affordable* t-shirts are made, perhaps it's the recession) as opposed to merely clingy.I also see there's a new re-usable version, which these seem not to be. However, when I misplaced one on, I was able to pull it off and immediately re-stick it correctly."
4,Timeless Tales 4 Star Review,"by Kir DevonJustin Flowers discovers that he is not like other kids in his thirteenth year of life. Everything changes when he discovers that he is a time traveler. Soon, Justin is visiting the ancient and more modern worlds with regularity. He is a Defender of History and must rescue The Orb of Time and keep it out of enemy hands.As Justin rides through the time stream and takes advice from major and minor historical figures, he knows he must stay one step ahead of the sinister Raveler. Soon, Justin begins to acclimate to the changes and learns some important lessons about himself.Justin Flowers and the Orb of Time is an intriguing blend of middle reader science fiction and fantasy. This is certain to appeal to Harry Potter fans. Justin's adjustments seemed glossed over, but did not truly prevent me from enjoying this book."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this movie based on all of the positive comments and was deeply disappointed in it. It is so predictable and shallow. The basic relationship issue upon which the movie is based was resolved in less than three minutes of dialogue. I'm not one for intense character exploration, but this movie just touched on each of the characters and the script was not worthy of the capability of the actors. I feel it was a total waste of money."
2,Just OK,"I found this reference to be very thin on practical, useful advice. I've paid less for better."
5,Easy to use,"This patch bay was perfect for my work. It was easy to install, terminate and install into a rack unit."
1,Not CAT6 complaint,"This product doesn't completely comply with CAT6 requirements up to 250Mhz. After installation, every single one of my lines fails NEXT and PSNEXT tests at >=218Mhz.If you want a product that will stand up to CAT6 specifications, avoid this one."
3,wishy washy,"Suzanne Vega definetely has talent as she shows us on Luca, Tom's Diner, 99.9 F and some of her other songs also have admirable qualities. Unfortunately her lyrics aren't always that strong and she kind of puts herself into that coffee shop playing female singer-songwriter genre. also this compilation jumps around too much and doesn't maintain a distinct vibe, much like other hits or retrospective packages that come out."
3,"For EE's only (well, maybe a few mathematicians)","Paul Nahin has taken a text on complex variables and made something of a historical novel out of it. Don't be fooled, this is not for the math weak. I will wager many bought it because of the title (and the super cover art, reminded me of Hesse' Magister Ludi) and it now lies gathering dust somewhere. If you can read it, it is a great story and lucid mathematical development."
1,Massa àlgebra,"Llibre interessant malgrat tot, si bé l'autor utilitza un nivell massa alt de matemàtiques, la qual cosa fa que la comprensió de l'obra estigui únicament a l'abast de persones amb una formació específica en aquesta matèria. No recomanable per a lectors sense formació superior en matemàtiques."
1,Formula after Formula,"Where is the history??? After reading Charles Seife's ""Zero : The Biography of a Dangerous Idea"", I was spoiled into thinking that this book would be the cool story of i; however, I was WRONG! The intro is cute and sets the reader up for a great tale. Bang, the first chapter has about 40 formulas for the reader to comprehend. I'm a math minor and gave up after chapter 1. If your idea of fun is to set around and review math problems, hey, this book is for you; otherwise, steer clear."
5,It's not just about leaving,"If you skip over this book because your company or organization does not have high turnover, you are missing a great opportunity to improve relationships that may help your company be more productive and grow. This book is about observation. What do you look for when someone is not performing up to their ability? Why has your best employee suddenly changed? Within the book are many scenarios and examples of DISENGAGEMENT (leaving, but keeping the body on the payroll). This may be costing you heartache and money.It is a very well written and researched book that should be in every managers and leaders bookcase. No! On your desk. Do not read and bury this book. Take it to heart and learn its lessons. I am convinced it will pay handsomely."
4,"Good battery, good price","I purchased 2 ea batteries for my Panasonic Lumix camera. I lost my original Panasonic battery, backup battery & charger on my last trip overseas. I shopped for OEM replacements & like everyone else, was shocked by the prices. So taking a chance, I bought another charger (this time with a DC option that the OEM charger did NOT have) and 2 of these batteries. I got a chance to use one last weekend, and after about 50 shots (many with flash), and using the zoom (a lot), I was never able to drain the battery. The next day I ran my camera in movie playback mode & reviewed pictures for another 10 minutes in an effort to get the low-battery indicator to come on, but it never did. I haven't tested the 2nd battery, but I hope it is 1/2 as good as this one."
5,LOVE THEM,"They get rusty after a bit because I own a dog wash and they get wet every day. BUT, they are the BEST nail clippers I have ever used - and I've used them all. They make it so you can shave off just the end of the nail if you need to and they don't put a lot of pressure on the nail while you're cutting it. That makes a huge difference in a dog sitting there and letting you cut nails when they have a fear of having it done. Love these. I just wish they lasted longer. Probably would for normal usage."
4,Works as expected. Good product for the price!,"The clippers work well. The guard does move a little bit but once you get used to it, the clipping goes fast. Good product for the price. :)"
4,Great Seller - Product Maybe Not for Cats,"Everything about this seller was great - timely delivery, etc.I have two cats & I thought this product would be okay for them but after trying to use it on them I think it is indeed better suited to dogs whose nails are much thicker & longer. It does, however, look & feel like a quality product.I would not hesitate to use this seller again & I do recommend ""him"" to others."
3,Cat is afraid of it,It might be good for others. My cat doesn't like these. I can't get them anywhere near his paws.
2,Slippery Guard,"I bought this because I lost my good pair and had trouble finding another one with a guard. The quality isn't the best and the guard constantly shifts around, not good when you're already struggling to get your cat to sit still."
3,Not what I ordered,"When I ordered this item, it was listed as a 20"" plush, not an 8"" plush, so you can imagine my disappointment when I opened up the tiny box that was delivered. It's a fine toy, but not what I ordered. I notified the seller of the situation and they told me they did not even have a 20"" plush. Someone had changed the listing without them knowing, so they were unable to provide the 20"" plush. They issued me a refund for the purchase price and told me to keep the item. It was a nice gesture, but now I have a tiny little Incredibles plush that I still paid $8 to ship that I don't want. The item is fine if you want a tiny version, but I ordered a 20"" plush and thats what I want."
5,Ozzie and Harriet 10 Episode Marathon,"This Ozzie and Harriet 10 Episode Marathon goes for about 250 minutes! Great transfer and sound for some really rare TV! The episodes selected are truly wonderful, especially the 2 Christmas episodes!"
2,a fan?,"After reading this book one really wonders whether Stump actually even likes prog rock! Stick with the Macan book - much more readable, enthusiastic about the music, just as intellectually challenging and not as simplistic as the Jerry Lucky books."
2,I Know What I Don't Like,"After reading this book, you have to wonder why the author wrote about this subject when it becomes apparent that he's not very fond of the subject matter. There are some exceptions but very few here. Very negatively opinionated at times and quite tediously dull. Again you have to wonder why the writing doesn't reflect the title of this book. The music DOES matter, this book doesn't."
4,Great storage,"Didn't quite fit onto the studs I had, so I used the drywall anchors that they included, and it's hanging strong. Fits my 4 martini glasses and 4 wine glasses--probably has room for two more wine glasses. The wine storage on top is really nice to have. My only criticism is it's a little hard to hang because of tight corners."
4,Just a taste of Nasr's insight....,"Seyyed Hosseein Nasr is the most profound and eloquent spokesman of Islamic thought in the United States today. This book is a mere introduction into the ocean of his thought. The other reviewer is simply trying to peddle his own book. The George Washington University, where Dr. Nasr is a professor, organized a conference in 2001 honoring his unparalled contributions to Islamic studies. Check out the site, ....., if you would like to have a sense of the depth and breadth of Nasr's thought."
2,slanted towards the Muslim view.,The book was helpful for me to gain an understanding of the Muslim point of view. However it definetly was biased in its view without any recognition of the wrongs that Islam has inflicted on society for the last 1400 years.
4,Towels 2,"I like these towels. Nice and fluffy, plenty absorbent. Nice color! Enhances the decor in the bathroom. Would buy them again."
4,Clever Repackaging of Osprey Aces Material!,"Here is a fine book for fighter ace aficionados. Osprey editor Tony Holmes has combined the cover art done by Iain Wyllie for 30 of the Osprey 'Aircraft of the Ace' series with photos and color profiles from those same books and then added firsthand accounts of the combats depicted, many from the aces themselves. The result would make a marvelous addition to any coffee table.Holmes' book spotlights many well-known aces such as Tommy McGuire, Heinz Schnaufer, Ken Walsh, Dave Schilling and Hiroyoshi Nishizawa along with lesser known aces such as Pete Brothers, Charles McCorkle and 'Pinkie' Stark. The combat reports are exciting; the artwork is wonderful; and the price ($29.95) easy on the pocketbook. What more can you ask for?"
1,Game Problems,"Once I downloaded the game, there were immediate problems. Once the game got started I couldn't get to play it. It started flickering instructions. Once I got to play game screen, it wouldn't do anything. Then I couldn't find the exit button. Then I was force to Delete Game out of my computer system. That too almosty didn't work. Once I got it Removed out of my computer and when I turned on my computer, it would automatically restart the game. It took about 45 min. to completely remove from my computer system."
1,Smells REALLY HORRIBLE - felt worse,"I am returning this product. As soon as I opened the bottle, it smelled really bad- very strong smell. Have been taking it for a week or so and feel more lethargic and moody than before! Going back to the other brand I was taking."
3,Second animated Batman film is very emotional.,"The second animated Batman film in the DCAU line was a classic when it came out, with emotional themes that were very rare in kid cartoons. A villain that isn't truly evil, only doing what he does for a tragic reason, it isn't the kind of stuff that happens much in kids cartoons.I enjoyed the film. It had a cool art direction, I like Mr. Freeze as a villain, his use of polar bears as minions was very smart, and the ending is very tense, a true nailbiter. It just felt like a professional Batman film. Still, I think I would have liked it more if Robin hadn't been almost completely useless in this film, and Mr. Freeze wasn't as threatning as he could have been. Still, this film is definately not bad, or even sub-par."
1,This had a Frozen plot.....,"Was there a story in this movie, I really wanted to like it, but it seems the makers of the Batman animated series just can not make a decent full length movie."
5,Most Impressive,"Few direct to video movies are ever very good, but this one was an execption. The plot: Nora Fries needs a heart transplant. Victor decides to take Barbara's (Bat Girl) Well Bat Man and Robin don't like that one bit so they take a trip to the oil rig he's using as his base and cause trouble for him and his polar bears (sounds odd I know, but it works) This is a really good film and it potrays Victor Fries very well. So get this film, kick back with some pop corn, and enjoy"
2,mammoth duplicity,"This is such a mammoth undertaking to make a single point that was never lost. I took the time to read the author bio and I have to presume that 1)his university studies didn't sufficiently hit upon Keynes (which is common given time constraints) and/or 2)the author assumed that since his colleges didn't give Keynes credit due that it was his duty. That is admirable.I am very sorry that so many pages were needed to self-publish this repetitive text. A vanity publisher such as Xlibris will never question your project as a traditional publishing house would. Further, since this is non-fiction, you would need only submit a proposal to a traditional publisher and they would have had contracted for expertise to determine the need."
5,Love this product,I love this product. It clips snugly to my son's viola case. He stores his shoulder rest and pencil in it. He also thinks it is pretty cool to have a case hooked to his viola case because no one else has one like it.
4,"For trivia buffs, crossword addicts and etomologists everwhe","I came across this book at a local bookstore that had a selection of books for word lovers. I perused it while I drank my frappacino, and soon was convinced I had to take it home with me. It is the most intriguing book I have ever read. It is formatted like a dictionary, but for everyone who loves word origin and other trivia, you will come back to it time and again. It is an example of useless knowledge at its best. The history of the word ""omelette"" is absolutely fascinating, and the evolution in the pronunciation of ""one"" intrigues me. They still can't decide where ""hobo"" comes from.I should mention one minute drawback--the man who first wrote these books (and his son continues the tradition) lived at the beginning of the twentieth century, so the book isn't as ""hip"" as the title would seem to indicate. If you aren't already interested in words, this won't get you going."
4,tissot watch,"I got the watch really quick ,its very nice ...there is only one problem with the watch -the alarm is not working- for which I got $40.00 discount...and I'm happy.Thank you"
3,OK read,Not bad. A lot a characters that were not tied together as well as I thought they could have been. Author could have streamlined story a little better.
2,Reader beware,"A glorified cut & paste job, replete with factual errors, clumsy paraphrasing and garbled information. In terms of the book's title, the central error is the continuation of the ""first SEAL"" myth first promulgated by this author and Roy Boehm. Boehm was not the first, nor did he originate SEAL teams. Readers seeking the documented facts should read the article ""What A Tangled Web We Weave"" by retired Navy Capt. David Del Giudice (1st CO, SEAL Team One) in the 2nd Quarter, 2002 BLAST, magazine of the UDT-SEAL Assn.Otherwise, I would suggest that readers consult Sasser's bibliography and read the original works for required information."
4,cool watch,"i really like this watch. pretty much does everything. Not extremely accurate especially the temperature, but it is close. it takes a long time to get a full charge unless you live your life outdoors. i work indoors.Matter of fact, the only time it had a full charge was when i spent a week vacationing in Mexico!Otherwise it looks great."
3,Product works well - I just wish the blades were angeled.,"The product does stay in place, so if safety is your main concern, this one doesn't move around. With that said, I just wish the blades were either angeled or v-shaped. Soft/lite items are easy to cut, but not as easy for others."
2,Perfect for ACOG,Fits my ACOG scope (3 X 30) perfectly and saves me from having to put on the stretchy sock things that ships with the ACOG. Just make sure you order the correct diameter for both ends of your scope.Update 4/12: I'm bumping this product down to 2 stars since the spring on the first one broke and now the tabs to lift it up broke on the second one. A good idea and fits well but not durable at all!
4,"Good price, fast shipping...","In a 7 day cycle i use this product every time, except flushing. At least 200-300 ppm helps the plants develop chlorophyll in a low light conditions aka (anything but the sun) and many other benefits for plant health."
5,Awesome Product!,What else can I say? It is a great product I recommend it for all photographers! The only problem is the edges get a little bent in shipping sometimes.
2,Great for elementary only,"For new teachers going into elementary school, this book is filled with good ideas and helpful advice. However, much of the writing is based on elementary students only. Most of the ideas would be considered too childish to use with middle or high school students. Also, many of the advice is clearly for elementary only (rewards for lining up in the hallway, giving students hugs, procedures for borrowing crayons, etc.) Looking at secondary teaching, I found this book disappointing."
1,i didn't like this book,"There is a negative tone set in the introduction, this book was not encouraging or uplifting, reading the whole book and didn't come away with new ideas or inspiration. This book repeatedly mentions the authors opinions without backing them up with experiences or research. I would have appreciated research to backup their statements or opinions. Also, I resented the (only) teacher of the year winner they recognized, that sitting in a desk and praying for a student each day, showering them with praise, worked to help the student... There is a section that lists everything you should have in a teachers desk, in the filing cabinet, etc... There didn't seem to be any unique suggestions I would think teaching experience would give them. Stapler and staples? No kidding. They jokingly mentioned handcuffs. Ha.Ha. I will not be keeping this book."
5,5 star product,I am delighted to have found this product. I've used it on my face daily now for a month. I love how its smoothed my 40-something skin. I use a light moisturizer too but this is like a therapeutic primer...I can see how it would be useful to treat any and all skin ailments. I have very sensitive skin and this has been a blessing.
1,Slimy slop,This stuff is a sloppy mess that doesn't accomplish anything other than being a sloppy mess. Avoid it. Waste of money.
1,Won't Last 4 Months..,"I loved this dryer for its small, compact size and remarkably fast drying speeding.. so much so that I bought one after the other, after the other, when my first one burned out. I suspected it was because of the dual-voltage aspect, taking its toll on the little guy while I was in the UK and Europe. However, I started noticing a pattern when I bought MY THIRD Andis 33805 dryer in the USA. With fairly normal use (once a day at the most) and careful care, this dryer still didn't last A FEW MONTHS before it started getting too warm, lost its ""turbo"" power, sparked and ultimately fried. I guess you get what you pay for and I'm not ready to shell out for Andis turbo #4, despite my previous love affair."
4,"Small, great hair dryer","The Andis 33805 Micro Turbo 1600W Dual Voltage Hair Dryer is great for travel and everyday use, and is lightweight, powerful, small, packable, works great. (I have three, oldest of which is 4 years old.)"
2,don't buy it from amazon,"Don't buy it from amazon, it arrived on time buy it had scratches and looked used."
1,2nd one broken in 6 months,Bought one in 2007 - went kaput in 2010bought one in 2010 - went kaput 6 month later!shoddy product - avoid
5,dual voltage hair dryer,This dryer was great in Europe and it doesn't take a lot of space. I'm glad to add it to my suitcase!
2,Not good for styling,"Bought this for European travel plans. Tried it once and it seemed to work well, but does not fit my needs, so I will be returning it. I use a blow dryer to style my hair and usually use a dryer with a longer barrel. The shorter barrel on this dryer made the airflow blow my hair all around, preventing me from styling. The longer barrel lets me concentrate the airflow to the area I am styling. For just getting your hair dry, this one is probably fine."
2,"Worked for two years, then started smoking","We had this hair dryer for two years. It was for my boys to use, so all they needed was a simple dryer. They usually wound up using my nicer hair dryer as they just didn't like this one. After two years of limited use, it just started smoking one day and we had to throw it away."
5,great value,"great value for the price; I would recommend this hair dryer. It's compact, easy to use and easy to store."
1,Piece of junk,"I set to 220, switched it on (incredibly stiff controls), it blew out. As a device for fusing the electrical system of your.average British home (where we were visiting) it is FABULOUS. As a hairdryer, however, it is a dud."
5,Great Study companion,I learned more with this book than I ever thought I could. Perfect for those seasoned Bible readers or those just beginning!
4,Firethorn,"The quality of this book just goes to show what can still be done with a more or less medieval-European setting. By knowing what she's talking about, by adding a wealth of worldbuilding detail and by adding interesting original touches in the form of herblore and religion, Micklem writes about knights in armor and still makes her story seem fresh and interesting. Deft sentence-level writing helps keep the narrative engaging.This character-driven story focuses on the relationship between the strong-willed herbalist Firethorn and the impetuous young knight Galan, but should not be avoided by those who normally avoid ""romance""; it is an intelligent story with plenty of action. Not all the secondary characters are equally well drawn and the brutish nature of most of them gets wearying at times, but overall this is a very impressive first novel."
1,Terrible Dissapointment,"I am probably not the only one expressing my distaste for this first installment of a fantasy trilogy which, we may hope, will NOT be continued. It boasts an attractive title and cover picture, but that is its best.I found myself admiring the author's style at first; full, lush, fantasy-suited descriptions that almost made her original world materialize in the reader's mind. The story, however, is of a peasant girl who, throughout the course of the story, becomes a ""sheath"" for a travelling nobleman. And, you guessed it, the story is filled with sex, sex, sex. A description in almost every chapter. Halfway through the book, the heroine is an abused sex toy. And this is what they call a modern fantasy novel? I pity an author who can find no better thing to write about.Please don't waste your time with this book."
1,Killed my drive,"This product worked for me for a while with no problem, and seemed like a great utility. Then one day a drive with 40 gigs of movie files was running a little slow. After ""verifying"" and ""repairing"" and ""rebuilding"" the drive I clicked on defragment. The dialog comes up warning to backup data because loss of power during defragmenting could cause loss of data. As soon as I clicked OK, the program quit unexpectedly rendering the drive inaccessable and all data lost! I wish I had used DiskWarrior for the defrag, because it doesn't rewrite directory data until a few seconds at the very end the process. Only use this as a last resort. No other utility could rescue my drive. I can't even imagine if this had happened to my main startup drive with all my applications and pictures."
5,This book allowed me to become self-employed!!!,"I read this book and taught myself HVAC/R, I was working for $15/hour when I quit and opened my own business. I am now self-employed in the HVAC/R business and have never been to a trade school!"
4,A well written book,This is a well written book about the Walker spy ring. While information gathered was from many hours of interviews of John Walker and others involved it does not show Walker in any good light as some of these books do. It shows him to be as evil and greedy as he was never thinking about anyone but himself. Overall this books seems to be an accurate account of one of the worst spy rings in the United States.
3,Some Good Performances,"There are excellent performances by Clapton, Sanborn & Crow. The Blige and Dylan performances were not so good. A mixed bag. The other Clapton dvd's are probably better. Not a keeper but a good 1 off rental."
2,Not Worth The Money,"I purchased this manual and once I received it was slightly dissappointed. The information was general which you can find on any VA's web site and more of how the author got started instead of focusing on really helping the VA get her practice built. The only thing I got from this manual was some search engines I had not thought of which I could have found with a little research.my suggestion, save your money and contact an actual VA for mentoring. They are more than happy to help."
2,just ok,tells about the parkway in depth but if you want to find a place to eat or sleep your on your own
3,Another beautiful coffee table cookbook,"If only the producers of this book put as much effort into coming up with recipes that I might consider making as taking beautiful photographs and doing a beautiful layout I would award 10 stars. As it is, I haven't made anything from this book and I love southeast asian food."
5,This literary and culinary triumph is a ticket to SE Asia.,"Of the dozen cookbooks I own, this remains my favorite. Mr. Alfrod and Mrs. Duguid bring the sights, sounds and smells of the Mekong river alive with excellent prose, assisted by photos from their travels. I have made about half the recipes in this book, and they are excellent. As the authors mention, their children love it, and I can believe it. Some ingredients and techniques are unusual, but the detailed instructions and indexes make it easy to get into SE Asian cooking. Some days I end up reading a few dozen pages when a just meant to pick a simple recipe. It is as delicious to enjoy in the study as in the dinning room!"
1,really a zero!!!,I copy DVD's 2 doesn't do anything it claims on the box.To this day I haven't got this software to work and I tried it on 3 different computers.Another thing that bothers me is MEE TOO SOFTWARE( the company that makes I Copy DVD's 2) signed me up for some stupid magazine that I didn't ask for.Look at this review and the others and judge for yourself.BEWARE!!!
1,Does not copy Copy Protected DVDs - DO NOT BUY!!!!,The advertisements and the box say that it copies Hollywood movies. When I tried to copy one of my movies it told me that it could not copy a copy-protected DVD and it recommended finding shareware that would first decrypt the software. What a rip-off! Don't waste your money. I miss the days when you could buy DVDXCopy.Anyone that says they don't need to make backup copies of their DVDs has never had kids. The surface of a DVD does not survive long with a 3 year old trying to put it in to the DVD player. :-)
1,Even with a DeCSS program - this is junk..,It turns out you can get a program called DVD-43 that will allow you to make backups of your DVD movies using this program by providing access to the DeCSS algorithm. But the compression (modification) technology that this tool uses to accomplish this makes the video quality *unbearable* in the duplicate. You can *see* the compression - even on a cheap TV set.Don't bother with this program - it's just complete junk.
1,Doesn't Copy Any DVD,"The box boasts of being able to ""copy any movie"", but that isn't the case. It does not have CSS encoding software built in, which is how most commercial DVDs are recorded.I do not have any experience with copying non-encoded DVDs with this software."
1,Good for Home Videos Only,"This product is great for transferring videos to DVD that you made yourself but it cannot copy ""any"" movie. Like most retail DVD authoring software, you can't use this to copy commercial movies that are copy-protected. If the makers of this product did not advertise this as a fully functional DVD copying program, then I would have given ICopy DVD three stars."
5,Reminded me about everything from when I went,"I was part of Coach Kersjes' 1995 group to go to Space Camp. As I read this, it made me think back about what myself and my other team members went through, from the training, to the actual time spent down in Huntsville, Alabama. While there was a six year difference, and some things had been different in our groups' journeys, we had a common goal... to succeed. It also helped me see what was going through Coach's mind and how hard he worked, just so myself and many others can not only have a chance to prove that we are capable of something greater, but possibly fulfil a dream in the process. Needless to say, I could not put the book down, and I had it read through in one day. I recommend this book to parents, teachers, former group members, anyone in college, or anyone else who needs an inspiration."
2,Need lenght of screws listed,"These were the screws that I needed by the pic I saw, but when I received them the screws were too short for my dog box! Needed to be about 1/4"" longer for my carrier! So I was a little disapointed, have not been to hardware store to see if I can get them the length I need??? Also I paid $1.36 I think for the fasteners but paid $5.00 in shipping for something that weighed nothing!!!! :("
5,Nice product,Works well for crafting. I had purchased one locally but it wasn't sharp enough for what I needed. This is a product that works well.
4,Excellent collection of Hemingway's best at fishing...,"Ernest Hemingway, beside being the premier American author of the twentieth century, also fished quite avidly. The assorted writings in ""Hemingway on Fishing"" range from articles written for magazines, to portions of books such as ""The Sun Also Rises"" and ""Old Man and the Sea."" One of the stories rivals the Old Man and the Sea when it comes to futility and heartbreak in fishing for marlin. Excellent book: if you enjoy Hemingway and the fish of the sea, get your hands on a copy."
1,Complete waste of money for me,"If you are looking something technological like I was or even theories, this isn't the book. And usually I think the pictures and examples are a good thing, but in this book it seemed that they were there to fill space. Can't recommend. But then again, it might be just because I misunderstood what the book was about and expected something more concrete."
5,Great Beginner Strength reference,"Even though it's written for coaches, it clearly shows beginners how to perform these basic lifts. It's a very helpful book for me. I do highly recommend this book for beginner lifters."
4,Lasted 3 Years before the sparks started flying,"Purchased this in 2009 and since the sparks started flying out of the dryer this week I decided to leave a review. It's worked flawless until today. My wife was drying her hair and sparks started coming out the end. This has happened before with other dryers thus the reason for my 4 star review. I'm buying another one as it will match the holes on the wall that are already there and it's been a nice small hair dryer....and for the price, can't beat it lasting 3 years. Not too concerned about the sparks as the heating wires over time get thin from all the heat...it's almost something you expect to happen and no one was hurt in the process. Overall a nice compact good looking unit."
5,lives up to expectations,"As I had minimal space on our bathroom counter I needed a hair dryer that could hang out of the way. I was able to attach it to the inside of the cabinet door below. Thus it is out of sight when not in use and very available when needed. As far as the function of the dryer, it lives up to my expectations."
4,Great value for the money!,"Works well for the money invested. Simple, two-speed rocker switch is adequate for most applications. Holder is very secure (easy to take dryer out and to put back). Cord hanger is a nice touch, especially if unit is mounted where the cord might dangle onto counter, into sink, etc. Moderate noise level, typical for this size of device."
4,Wife can't wait to use her Andis Hangup hair dryer,Have not installed the hair dryer yet in my RV. But looks well built and easy to install. My wife can't wait to use it.
1,Do not buy this product,I bought this hairdryer as I was moving and needed to leave my older one in the house I was moving from. I bought it in advance of the move and it stayed in the box. I have now opened it and hung it on the wall. After I turn it on it shuts itself off fron overheating in less than one minute. I am past the 30 days to return as I didn't open and use it when I got it. It is a piece of junk. Don't buy it. Now I am going to have to lose my money on this piece of crap and buy another one to replace it.
1,Shuts Down on high setting in 2 minutes or less,Not a good purchase. My unit shuts off when run on high setting after a couple of minutes. Nothing is obstructing the flow. Thie other setting (low) manages to stay on but dries your hair to a crisp.
1,Outa Control Ego maniac,"Wow, this man is worse than the guy who invented the internet . . . There is so much self flattery, it borders on flatulence . . . don't waste your time, Pelton has a NON STOP EGO. I bet he makes up half the stuff . . . Where was the editor ??? Must have been his wife !"
4,wide variety of patterns,"There are so many patterns that I could own this book for years and still not try them all. I'm working on the pattern shown on the cover, and it's turning out to be an attractive piece that's easy to handle. I haven't found any pattern errors in what I've tried so far. There are also many edgings, baby caps, and collar/cuff sets, should the tatter get bored with table mats.My reason for giving 4 out of 5 is that the photography doesn't show as high of pattern detail as I'd like. It probably couldn't be avoided since these are reproductions of black and white originals. I'm also finding it more difficult than usual to keep my place in the pattern, likely due to the small print size. I have started making my own charts and diagrams on separate pieces of paper and refer to the pictures for motivation--imagining how nice my table will look when I've finished--rather than pattern guidance."
3,SOME THINGS WORK...SOME THINGS DON'T!...THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THAT DIDN'T!!!,"Although Marvin Gaye did a killing on the ""When I'm Alone I Cry"" album, this one just didn't quite get over the hump. On a few songs (The Ballads) Marvin does 'Wonders' on them, but on the uptempo songs...There's nothing to write home about. If your buying this just to complete your Marvin Gaye collection, fine!, but to hunt this down, No!"
4,Second Edition - more interesting trivia,"Like the prior edition this book contains a collection of trivia questions and answers that center around world culture, politics and geography. As such it is not only interesting but also educational. So many trivia books contain such obscure information that it has no value other than as a trivia question. That is not the case with either the first or the second edition of this book. ""World Trivia"", second edition is a complete rewrite that contains none of the questions of the first edition. Michael Smith again tackles one of the most difficult areas of trivia because culture, politics and many aspects of geography are in a state of constant flux. So, while the trivia questions and answers are accurate today, within a few years many of them may not be. With well-chosen educational and truly interesting questions the book is a recommended purchase."
2,Fabulous Protagonist; Faulty Authors,"The bios of Oppenheimer and company are expressed with the depth and narrative richness of a High School year book. If JRO had not been beaten up in the ""courts"" of McCarthyist goons there would be no biography at all. How cruel to reduce a fabulous life to a political incident, no matter how injurious. While Richard Rhodes, author of the scintillating The Making of the Automic Bomb juggled a dozen balls at once (physics, math, biography, history...) it took two authors to balance each element of American Prometheus as though it were a broken egg. Lamentable."
3,Very good but flawed history of a great and flawed man,"Just two notes:Missing in all this is the role of Stalin. As good liberals and humanists, the authors miss the evil beat of Stalin who lived until 1953!!! Oppie suffered 'cause he also just did not join the anti-Stalinist crusade; he was too diffident.Second, the personal tragedy with his kids is appalling and sad.Make of that what you will about the man.Best, NH"
3,Far too detailed,"I'm still ploughing through this word bog. I'm looking for some nugget or insight into the man's mind-but it's a hard slog. Far too much information that is to my mind superfluous. There's a fine line between detailed and informative and the authors have slid over to the dull side. Why not show photographs of his hat maker? What brand of cigarettes did Oppie smoke? I know he had a horse called 'crisis' but so what? I don't think I will have the intellectual stamina to finish this tomb and it's a shame. Farmelo makes the same mistake with Dirac's storyThe Strangest Man: The Hidden Life of Paul Dirac, Mystic of the Atom-too much detail. But then Farmelo won an award for his book so what do I know?"
4,Good read,"I was very much looking forward to reading this book, and it didn't disappoint. The authors have done an excellent job of sifting through an enormous mass of evidence. Their use of this evidence is judicious, and their portrait of the man compelling. It is well worth reading.I have only one criticism. The reader of this book will learn virtually nothing about quantum mechanics, the area of physics in which Oppenheimer made his reputation. That seems a pity. I'm not suggesting a textbook treatment, but more about the physics would have added further depth and interest for non-technical readers (like me). For this reason, I have to say that even though I think Oppenheimer is a much more interesting figure than Richard Feynman, the biography of Feynman by James Gleick is overall more successful than ""American Prometheus."""
4,History of the A-Bomb in American Physicist,This book is an excellent history of the creation of the atomic bomb and a realistic look at Oppenheimer. It is helpful to remember how America managed this increase in technology.
5,Very Insightful,"What a beautiful and inspiring novel this turned out to be. As an English Illyrianologist who has been studying the ancient balkans for a long time, I must say Robert Elsie has done a good job in presenting this material in a rather cautious and professional way."
3,Lamp,"The floor lamp was a slight challenge to assemble with a very fine thread which is not continuous around the circumference. I have two of this lamp and the three way switch in both do not have a distinct ""notch"" at each position. Also the switches require quite a bit of torque to rotate. It does a nice job of lighting without being reflected in a TV screen."
5,"""The Kiss Mixer is incredible........","""The Kiss Mixer is incredible. I have been training for over 15 years and tried every supplement and nutritional product around, but nothing beats the nutrients of real foods. I have more energy throughout the day and my workouts are through the roof. Also, it fits my busy lifestyle, is easy to use, and I can take it anywhere. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to look better, feel better, and get the most out of your healthy lifestyle.""Jea Jung2004 Mr. South Carolina"
1,Clipped 3 nails and broke after the 4th,I bought these off a diff site but used them on a shihtzu maltese mix 1 yr old puppy.........they look durable but broke after the 4th nail.. I've also taken it apart and reassembled it but still doesnt work (the problem is whenever I try to cut a nail it doesnt cut it just gets caught between the steel edge and the black metal part with the hole. Piece of junk......don't waste your money on it
2,"Great watch, but quality not what I expected","I bought one middle of 2007 because I travel frequently to different timezones. However, I have had to return it three times already for repairs.Once the handles got stuck, then the light didn't work, and now the time keeps flashing and the handles are stuck on the date. When I buy a watch of a decent brand for a decent price, I expect it to work for more than a year without such issues."
2,I have the steel band model of the Tissot 3000,I have this watch for almost 5 years I love the look and its features as i am almost every week in a different time zone. the down side is that the watch is not reliable at all - i have had to take it in several times for repair as several features stopped working. recently it stopped functioning again and i was told the entire mechanisim has to be changed (something I would not expect from a watch that is marketed as a high end quality)- and they asked for 350 USD to repair the watch. My sons Casio that went through tough training is already 6 years old with zero problems. I wrote to Tissot in Swiss and am waiting for there answer. In any case I would not purchase another Tissot - the reliability of the products is very poor. My friend has a T Touch and had to replace it after 3 months - and now after 4 years it has a problem again.
3,Mixed review,"Watch has great technical features, which take some getting used to. Once you get the hang of it, you'll love it. But I returned it. I really wanted the one with the steel band (hard to find at discount price). The leather strap is poorly made...neon orange stitching is crooked, which stands out like a sore thumb against the grey leather. It should be simple to get that right, especially for a Swiss watch like Tissot. I think the seller has obtained ""less-than-perfect"" condition watches and therefore the discount (you usually really do get what you pay for). I found that glaring imperfection to be unacceptable, so I sent it back. Waiting on refund."
5,Good thick paper results almost stellar,When I switched from an Epson paper to this Kodak product the results were better and the paper was cheaper. I highly recommend this quality product
3,netgear 802.11a,"Bought both the access point and card bus. Set up not simple. Had to call tech support. Don't like tech support. Always get people with accents. Not only are they difficult to understand, they were impatient. If they don't know, they send me to some website to look up my information. One time they said they would call back but never did when I had trouble setting up the WEP security access. Got it working just by fooling around. Really don't know what I did. Don't even know if it's secure. Changed the settings one time and it took it me the entire evening to get back to working condition. I relied mostly on XP Professional to set the system up and avoided Netgear's proprietary software. Connection currently is stable at turbo mode. Are the other products easier to set up?"
3,does get off easy,"this one is really hard to put on a strong dog, it took me a lot of time getting it on my 90 pound dog, once it was on, he got it right of with a few head shakes and paw scratches...would not recommend for strong dogs"
1,Didn't work,Was looking for a muzzle which would gently keep my big puppy from trying to eat everything. It took approximately 30 seconds for the puppy to remove it when it wasput on properly. Would not recommend this to anyone. The seller was good and delivered product very quickly.
4,Steam and Intrigue!,I could not put this book down. It holds your attention and keeps you guessing up until the very end. Debra Webb does a good job of using red herrings and then surprises you. The strong female character does not overshadow the sexy strong male character. Steam as well as intrigue..
3,good book not really detailed,"This book covers several topics in linear algebra, it is quite formal but could be hard for a novice, because several steps in proofs and examples are missed, I hardly recomend the other book from the author (Linear algebra with applications) for whom has problems with this missed steps. Unfortunately here in Brazil just this edition has been translated to portuguese.However, the book covers a lot of topics and the sequence of the content is very useful nowadays in applied sciences as economics, if you can overcome the not so detailed examples you will definitely adore this book because it is a mathematically consistent book and exercises are very well chosen. But as always in maths results are not instantaneous you have to try many times and if you do result if going to be whorty."
3,Nice Format & Interesting Stories,"This book would make a wonderful gift for an Italian American with either a Sicilian or Neapolitan descent. Intersperced in each of the usual Italian cookbook sections--antipasti, zuppe, pasta, frutti di mare, carne e pollame, verdure and dolci---are stories about Sicilians and Neapolitans that whet not only your culinary interest in these amazing people but also your interest in their culture and traditions. The book is punctuated with beautiful full page color photos of both the food, the places and the personalities. Ruggiero offers an amusing lexicon of Sicilian and Neapolitan phrases--that although I am not Sicilian or Neapolitan myself, I could relate to them with a broad smile as they seem to be indigenous to the Southern Italian dialect and can be easily recognized if not by spelling at least by sound by any Italian American. This book is a fun way to look into your heritage and at the same time prepare and eat good food."
2,Shows the seeds of promise,"""Home from Home"" does not stand the test of time and is in no way a classic. If you are a Heads, Hands, and Feet collector, then you have, or will want to have, this recording. Do not expect the energy of their other works, for the balance on this early work in more ballads, more Tony Coulton.Now that is not necessarily all bad, for Coulton is a great vocalist. But tracks like Friend of a Friend and Windy & Warm, for instance, are not going make anyone's compilation CD. On the other hand, Bringing It All on My Own Head showcase the band's vintage harmony and energy. Achmed is a curious little gem. Home from Home ranks up there with Simon and Garfunkle's My Little Town as one of the bleakest depictions of a town on record. Make Me Feel Much Better is trite, and the rest of the tracks may or may not prove engaging.Still, these early songs show that HH&F were clearly on to something fresh and worthwhile, and this early promise does blossom more in their subsequent efforts."
2,Very Disappointing,"The main reason I bought this CD was to hear the opening theme song from the ""Road to Avonlea"" series. I assumed it would be on the CD as the CD is called the Original Series Soundtrack and it is the theme of the series but it is not there. It was very disappointing to myself and my family. If anybody knows where the theme can be purchased can you please let me know. The other songs are nice but do not have that special uplifting element of the theme song."
5,Perfect for Hiking and Bicycling,"This map is clear and precise. It's the only map I used during my trip as it shows the roads, the carriage roads, all the hiking trails, and even the shuttle bus stops. It was handy to have just eastern Acadia on one side of the map. I'm glad that I bought the tyvec version as I used this map constantly. Although my map didn't get exposed to moisture, (we were lucky to have perfect weather), tyvec is also more durable than paper."
1,no good,there's not much to talk about this battery. i got a full charge and it got low after maybe ten exposures.
5,Good Stuff,"My family and I love to listen to thgese stories as we travel. My kids even look forward to long trips.The stories are creative, inspiring, fun and family friendly. I highly recommend them."
4,"A fresh voice, but left me wanting more.....","I loved Bly's 'take no prisoners' style of dealing with writing teachers, and writing programs, their strengths and their shortcomings. Her insights about how some aspiring writers can be harmed or have their work stymied in its fragile state by workshops and comments by well-meaning students or teachers, is reassuring. However, I wish she had gone further, for instance, in her chapter addressing the process of first, second, etc. drafts of a manuscript. Her comments about the need to protect the work, and to give it time to develop through multiple drafts is valuable, but I believe it could have been fleshed out further."
1,way too much,"this book was recommended, so i bought it. Wished I hadnt. Too much non-sense, and way too complicated for an otherwise ""Simple"" subject. I gave it to a intellectual friend of mine who said it was mindless rambling."
2,Not convincing,"This book tries to convince non-Christian skeptics but seems to spend too much time justifying orthodox perceptions and concepts of prayer and liturgy, without addressing fundamental objections."
5,A classic in the making,"This was a wonderful book. The insights of the author were deep and encouraging. The book certainly would strengthen someone's faith. He deals with most of the common ideas of Christianity, such as worship, belief, transformation, but is not ""out there"" is his ideas. In fact, his ideas are fresh, without being strange. This is a great read with great insights. Certainly a book most people would enjoy and benefit from."
2,A Tad Disappointed,"While I am a big fan of Ms. Moore and have been since she arrived on the music scene, the addition of hubby and fellow crooner Kenny Lattimore could have been left off. To me, her voice has always been strong and overshadows Kenny's. The concept of for lovers (always a good theme) kinda left me hanging on this CD because except for the title track (the best on the CD) and Loveable (From Head to Toe), the CD is remakes. I would have thought that these 2 contemporaries would have come up with original material. I really hate to give the CD 2 stars because my love for Chante but I heard nothing other than what was mentioned earlier that made me go Wow. For those considering the purchase of this CD, be forewarned - if you don't like remakes, this is not the CD for you."
5,good counsel,"Dr Coles' book is a sure guide to the thickets, trials and tribulations of learning to read and teaching to read and helpful counselor for parents and professionals. The writing is straight (with an enlivening dry wit) and will take the reader with certainty to an understanding of what occurs in our schools and of what must be done. And with the understanding comes a how-to knowledge that will help all concerned. Dr Coles gives a comprehensible history of the science and mis-science and practices of reading teaching that will enable advocates to present their cause comprehensibly. It tells one where the ""experts"", good and bad, are coming from and arms one to encounter them capably. Buy this book: you'll like it and use it!"
3,Not Meeting Expectations,"Well, I've always been a big fan of SVU books and I love the characters. However, I thought the last few books (including this one) weren't the best ones by far. I still want Elizabeth to be with Tom and I just don't like Sam very much. I also wish that Jessica wouldn't do so much flirting (not that she isn't good at it!) but try to find a guy--I really liked Nick. I always thought they were good together. The dynamics of the book and characters have changed and I can't really get into it. I wish the old gang were back together. Tom and Elizabeth included."
5,Liz,"I think Jess is just looking out for her twin sister, making sure her best friend. But in some ways, I do think Elizabeth is going to be hurt in some way.Chloe, on the other hand, tried to change her image and become like Nina, and look where it got her,so her image is good the way she is.And Neil...um i dont know but it is a ecxallent book"
2,EH...,"I wouldn't use this to sleep in cause it's not very comfortable and can be very distracting(which isn't good if you're trying to sleep)..Also the elastic band isn't comfortable at all. If you want one to sleep in better get one made of silk or a softer material than this one..If you need a blindfold and not a sleep mask than this may do, but not for a sleep mask.."
2,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this lip treatment. My lips tend to be very dry and I am always looking for something new to try for that problem. This product actually made my lips even drier and redder. It feels great going on but after that it is downhill. I normally love the Olay Regenerist line of products and that is why I thought this was going to be great. Sorry to say, but the Anti Aging lip treatment just doesn't cut it."
4,Superb!!,"Awesome product, makes the best paninis and it comes with a wonderful recipe book! The heat control knob is a little bit loose but it doesn't effect performance. Great buy!"
3,a gift,"Thought is was a good choice as a gift, but they wanted something with an auto shut off, sso it was returned"
5,LOVE IT!!!!,I GAVE THIS FOR A GIFT AND IT WORKED SO GREAT THAT THEY GAVE US THE SAME ONE BACK. EASY TO USE AND CLEAN - MAKES REALLY GOOD SANDWICHES - WE USED IT ALMOST EVERYDAY FOR THE FIRST MONTH BUT NOW ONLY COMES OUT ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK SO JUST BUT IT YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY.
2,Italian doesn't = a good product,"Sandwiches haven't been that great, still searching for the right bread. Needs removable grates for cleaning."
2,Leio Maria,Was the correct title but an older edition than I thought I was ordering so it is not actually still usable.
1,A Painful Experience,"I entered engineering at the University of Cincinnati with little or no knowledge of physics. Through the use of this book I feel I now know less than before. I think this book acts as a Black Hole, because it lacks so much it has to pull the knowledge from its readers. I do not recommend this book."
1,"Horrible, simply horrible","Words cannot express the disdain I have toward this book. I was forced to use this ""book"" (if you can call it that) during my freshman year at the University of Minnesota, and at the end of the semester, I was thoroughly confused about a subject that I previously considered myself very knowledgeable. I recommend that this book no longer be printed, that it no longer befuddle the minds of otherwise promising young scientists and engineers. Full of confusing and irrelevant derivations, this book does not accomplish its goal of developing the minds of young students, but rather it hinders development in an amazingly bad way. Instructors, please do not make the mistake of using this text to ""teach"" your students. Show them that you care about the quality of their education. Thank you."
1,The book is pointless to read.,"This book is pointless. The problems are obscure, and the explanations vague, complicated, and confusing. Might as well not even read the book."
2,"""Physics for Scientists and Engineers"" a very difficult book","I find this book to be extremely difficult to understand in many places. It should not be used as an introduction to Physics, but should rather be used for higher level teachings. The book is filled with proofs of laws and theorems, which are absolutely unecessary from the point of view of a student learning basic principles of Physics. Examples are scarce and sometimes do not completely relate to the topic being discussed. Questions at the end of the chapters always involve information not provided in the chapters, and sometimes puzzle even the instructor(as in my case). Giving a difficulty level to the given problems is a good idea, and there are some nice illustrations and pictures. On a scale of A through F, this book should receive a D or a 4 out of 10."
1,Always three sides to truth,"Never accept only one side as the truth - no matter what it is ""based on"". This is probably just a case of he who makes the most noise."
1,Far from the truth,"Since I know both parties involved here I can assure you that most of what will be in this book is completely twisted and that Robert Carey is far from ""Normal""."
3,Solid Power Punk/Pop,"I tend to agree with the reviewers below except for the songwriting, which a set of consistent hooks are lacking. The guitar and vocals are great, and a few of the songs stick with you over time. ""Haunted"" is a neat experiment, and could have been a knockout tune with a more distinguishable chorus. This album sounds tremendous while it is on, but dosen't leave enough behind when it is done. Still, it is much better than many of the bands out there, and remember that it usually takes a band two or three albums under their belt before they deliver their masterpiece (like with Allister and Green Day.) Give them time."
2,"Analyses are incomplete, leading to flawed conclusions","Overall, the book needs more thought, time, and work invested in it. In spite of that fact, some aspects of the book are very instructive. Mr. Rowson seems to have only a partial understanding of the Grunfeld, which unfortunately leads to some inaccurate conclusions."
4,Not exactly the great book I expected from Peter David,"I liked the book, but after reading some other Peter David's novels, I thought this one would also be a 10 in my list... it wasn't, altough it's a good book, and if you like Peter's work, you'll probably also like this one.Just don't expect a Q-Squared or Imzadi novel because it is not THAT good."
3,"Interesting, but you need a huge attention span.","I bought this album because it sounded interesting. I've ahd no past experiences with any of Pinhas' old material or even Heldon. but I bought this mostly because it sounded like Main. (get their Hertz album if you enjoy this one.)While this disc does have some interesting moments on it, it all tends to blur together after a while and becomes wall-paper music. though, one interesting thing I found is that played at lowerlevels of volume, it makes for a rather interesting ambient album..."
4,Don't buy this book used at absurdly inflated prices!,"If this was a book worth writing and reading (it was), then it was also worth editing and proofreading. In fact, however, the book is marred by egregious redundancies, stupid typos, and other editorial lapses. The publisher's handling of this title has been unprofessional from start to finish; witness the unavailability of the book, despite the great interest in reading it (an interest that encourages Amazon.com and others to jack up the price to three figures). It would serve the author and the book if Rowman and Littlefield would simply let the book go all the way out of print and let a real publisher edit, reprint, and properly publish it."
3,Exactly What It Claims to Be,"Full of retro flair this cookbook was fun to flip through and had entertaining historical trivia sprinkled throughout. It is exactly what it claims to be: diner food. Meatloaf, tuna sandwiches, biscuits, waffles, pie, and multiple types of soup fill the pages. If you've already got go-to recipes for most of these things, don't expect anything big from this book. If you're looking for good recipes (or to recreate flavors and memories from the past) for these items, this would be a great place to start."
2,Does not support USB streaming to transfer data/ does not include ilink or firewire,This comes with two calblesUSB- but this camcorder does not support USB streaming so you can tranfer from camcorder to computer using it ( sony support confirmed)AV- which generally laptop/desktop will not have ports for..so better shop around a product which has easy to transfer interface.. or be ready to spend another 30$ for ilink wire...
3,"Good for taping, problem uploading","The Sony Handycam was very easy to use and record. However, when we wanted to upload it to the computer, it turned out that the USB cord that came with it does not work with the program which comes with the Handycam (on a DVD). This we learned after ""chatting"" on line with Sony tech support twice for 20 minutes to no avail, and then talking to tech support for 40 minutes. The tech support guy (in India) was finally able to tell us about a Windows program which is compatible with the USB cord, but this is nowhere in the instruction booklet or any of the online materials."
2,If you absolutely cannot afford anything else,"If you absolutely cannot afford anything else, this is a cheap product that might last you through your first project. I used one of the bits (torx t6) to take down a pocket knife, and upon putting the knife back together, one of the bits actually twisted on me. It didn't break, but twisted longitudinally. I've never had a bit do that.The second star is for the off-chance you need all of these bits for a project that requires minimal torque."
3,great but not really.,i recieved these not two weeks ago and somehow they are starting to rust. I had them in the case the came in but still they are rusting. these would be way better if they weren't made of some cheap metal.
3,Extension Shaft couldnt be held in place,"When i got this in the mail i was so excited to try it on my harddrives i wanted to open up.I picked up the extension rod, and to my surprise, no matter how much i tightened the driver's screws, the shaft wouldnt stay in its place. So i figured, had i used the actual screw bits, it would have already fallen into the screw driver.buyers, beware of fitting the screw bits directly onto the driver head, it may fall inside, and you wont get it back.so what i do now is to use the extension rod as the new screw base, and mount another bit on top of it. That way, it stays in place, and i wont risk it falling into the screw driver shaft."
1,"Handle is cheap plastic, bit fall out","This set is pretty much useless. The handle is cheap plastic and the bit holder won't hold onto the individual bit, so each time you lift the screwdriver off the screw, the bit falls out of the handle. I wish now that I had read the other reviews before I wasted my money. btw this set is not magnetic"
2,"The Bits are great, but....","The bits in this set are great, however the driver handle that the bit shaft fits into is made of a flimsy plastic that has a screw down compression screw that is also made of a flimsy plastic. This is Not a good design because the plastic compression piece does not grip or hold the metal bit shaft very well. If these plastic pieces were made of metal or at least a heavier grade of plastic, I would give this set a 5 star rating. As it is, I am looking for a replacement handle that will accept the odd size bit shaft.Sorry about the weird labels in my description, I don't know the proper names of the various pieces."
2,The driver slips,"The bits are really nice, the price was good, but the driver tends to slip. The chuck just doesn't hold the bits well enough. If you tighten it down enough you can get it to work -- most of the time. But that is just not reliable enough for a tool.. I would have liked to recommend this, but I just can't."
3,Cheap tools;No marking,The quality of bits is ok & its cheap. But the marking of bits on the carrying case would have been easy to take or keep bits.
5,Another Step In the Right direction,"I expected another great book about nature's ability to communicate with life forms in more ways than we expect. Instead I got MORE! Influencing each other in ways once couldn't imagine, this book builds past the works of even Michael Roads (author of great works like Journey Into Nature). It is almost too advanced for me just now, but a book I will definitely go back to again and again.Reads like a story (because it is) then builds. Another one to put in my top 10 best books, which I'll have to extend to top 20 soon!"
5,Great CD,This is a must have CD if you love jam music and a little blues. My favorite track is Press On. You'll love it too. Amen.
5,Always Superb,"The songs that Collin Raye chooses to record are ones that every human being can relate to. Words that turn into personal messages that only the listener can truly interpret. His voice is easy to listen to and his music is never disappointing. My personal favorite on this CD is ""We'll Be Alright."" There's a message in that one for EVERYONE no matter what circumstance surrounds them."
2,Kinda lame,Somewhat interesting to those who are familiar with the UFO field because it weaves real cases throughout history in with the fictional story line. Pretty low budget stuff with lackluster actors and acting. I can see why it only lasted one season. No camparison to the quality of the X-Files.
5,Gift for Dad,"My dad had originally ordered this and paid top-dollar unknowingly for a bad pirated copy. It turned out just like the title DARK throughout! Later, I found this Shout Release of one of his favorite series and the company has a great reputation. The price was accommodating and the quality is great. Highly recommended for fans of X-Files."
2,"Only 75 connectors, orange was so dim you couldn't see it.","I have purchased these over the years and I basically am satisfied with the glow sticks. But this time many more broke when snapped and leaked the fluid on the kids. There were only 75 connectors in each tube rather than 100. And the orange glowed so dim that you really couldn't see it, so 20% of the bracelets were worthless. The fluid wasn't distributed evenly inside the bracelets so there were gaps between the areas that did glow. But the price is cheap enough that we just purchased extra to make up for all the defective ones."
3,Almost great but...,"Cannot turn off heat settings for cool air- that would be nice. Motor lasted exactly three years and then died a slow, stinky death. Otherwise, nicely built, handy and decent product. Will consider again..."
3,barely satisfied,"It does not heat as well as I think it should, barely adequate and would not purchase again."
1,Run Away!,"Don't waste another minute of your life looking at this piece of junk. I am VERY disappointed.First, the wall-mount...these screw anchors are the largest I've used on such a small device. My last mounted hair dry used pilot holes almost half the size. My son's book shelves used smaller holes than these things! Then, once you get these beasts into the wall, the unit mounts onto the mounting plate with a single turn screw. So the white plastic unit still wiggles every time you use the hair dryer!Second, this thing only runs for 15 seconds before overheating (yes, I timed it)! Sure, you could turn it down so the heating coils are off, and the fan still in high, but what's the point?My wife, with shoulder length hair, refuses to use it because it turns off so quickly. Do your self a favor and look somewhere else!"
4,A user friendly Eng Mech text.,"My lecturer for this subject in first year was excellent, and took the time to explain all that was needed, so I never really looked at Dynamics, and Statics was fairly easy. On hitting second year, however, I found that it was not that easy. I fell back on the text, and found that it covered all that I needed. Between myself, a friend and Meriam and Kraige I was able to score a pretty decent mark, and much more importantly understand what it was all about.The book has fair to good examples, plenty of diagrams and a fairly accessible approach. Being an incipient engineer rather than a mathematician, I found that I coped very well with the style, which while it covered the maths, it focussed on what was happening.A very solid text in a subject that is impossible to cover well for every reader. It suited me well, and it still sits on my shelf as a very useful reference."
1,An issue with this book,"I don't have the background to assess most of this book, but there's one item that falls into my area of knowledge and it's a problem.This book, about the Jadgtiger, contains some material from manuals describing a different vehicle. Its source is not given.The author has copied some wording and a full-page diagram from the British report on Tiger 1 tank. It describes an engine fan which was unique to Tiger I, therefore the material has nothing to do with Jagdtiger and does not belong in this book. The author really should understand that not all ""tiger"" series tanks had swappable components!I'm particularly puzzled that he prints a photo of a small, small valve in the Jagdtiger and basically says ""there's the fan I was talking about"". They don't even look similar!"
1,What the crap?,"Are you people reading the same book as me? This book is terrible; I could be more entertained with a single corn flake than I was with this book. I expected a little more from this ""world famous"" author. I say, no more expensive sleeping aids and visits to the sleep clinic, just buy this book. Page after page of whining, is what I call it. There was more whine in this bit of ""literature"" than all of France. Comparable to Edgar Allan Poe? Certainly not! There was meter and rhyme schemes and brilliant construction of classicly eerie gothic storytelling. I saw nothing of that in this book. I've seen more thought-out pieces of poetry in preschools. I will admit, Raven is good at journalistic style work, but if he's a poet, I'm a ferret."
4,Greetings,"I have read every piece of work that Raven has written on his site, and yet it is the same every time. He expresses his emotions in ways that we can all relate to. He is a very smart person. I know one thing is for cretin he is a great writer."
1,Bait and switch,"If you order this item through Amazon you receive a Lexmark P350 portable photoprinter. The box is quite clearly labeled. Maybe that's why they don't show the box. This might be a handy little inkjet printer but it is certainly not the a color lazerprinter. I have no idea why Amazon supports this deceitful marketing. Maybe they are really confused. Certainly the price is completely wrong for a color lazerprinter. Anyway, as always, the buyer must beware."
4,Great little books.,"These are good, well thought out cozys. I like the needlework patterns too, especially this one which is a spider hanging from its web."
4,The best so far!,"I enjoyed this installment of Betsy Devonshire's sleuthing escapades. This novel was a more thoughtful story than the previous ones, the clues a little more subtle and the characters interesting. I found Betsy's love interest a little shadowy...not very well defined...and if this is the first book you read in the series, you might find yourself at a loss to connect with many of the people in the book. Betsy, herself, came alive a little better than previously. I am a needleworker, but I think people who aren't, and read these stories, would find her constant references to specific needlework items and people a little disconcerting. It's almost as if the author is trying to throw in her 'knowledge', but in an awkward way.Even with these criticisms, I did enjoy the story and am looking forward to the next one."
2,hard work!,"I read this book as part of a course on holistic health but found that whilst it is clearly a highly venerated work its language was actually quite hard to follow. I have not had the benefit of reading the original work so cannot compare but this was very hard work, which was extremely disappointing.As it is a self-published book/edition (by Holst) it contains some annoyances with the main one being that the index is extremely light and unhelpful. Also from an academic point of view there are no references. As the book is based on a work completed nearly 100 years ago its insights are visionary and inspiring but for a more informative approach I would recommend examining other works in the relevant areas that are more up-to-date - probably quantum physics is a good place to start!It is a book of philosophical concepts that embrace science at an extremely superficial level by today's standards."
2,Hmmm...,"My problem with this book is the characters. Does everybody have to be a super-man or super-woman? I like characters I can Identify with, not super-powered brainiacs who could rule the world if they chose to. Its hard to identify with ex-navy SEALs who also have advanced degrees in every discipline known to man. It was like watching an episode of Baywatch where the characters were smart and good-looking.I appreciate that the other reviewers like the fast-paced plot, and it is well written, but the dialog sounds like a bad soap opera (""As you know, Bob, I...""). It was hard to finish. Buy it at a discount if you like these kind of thrillers, but if you want characters, look elsewhere."
5,FINALLY!,I have been waiting forever for this! It's finally here. I can't wait for all the seasons to be released.
2,"Great Show, bad video quality","Next to Friends, this is my favorite TV show and I was so excited to get it on DVD. The picture quality is poor--almost blurry. I also have TV shows from the 50's on DVD and the quality is crisp, sharp, great contrast - why couldn't CBS do that for this wonderful show? Very disappointing."
3,"Very interesting, but a little disappointing","The book gives lists of words based on various themes or categories, to help you expand your vocabulary in French. Lists are broken down also into levels based on how common the words are (with more formal or technical words in later lists).I find it a fascinating book to sit down with and browse for 10-20 minutes at a time, learning new words.However, I find that I question sometimes whether the words they are offering are really the most appropriate way to express particular ideas. In particular, some of the vocabulary given in business or office contexts seems to me to be quite different from what I hear or read from native French speakers.Nevertheless, the book is very good and useful. Too many people learning French just rely on a dictionary to help them find words they don't know. Learning lists of themed vocabulary is an important part of increasing your proficiency, and this book would be a great help in doing that."
2,Review,This book is not up to standard. It is disorganized and difficult to follow. Not sure who the audience is supposed to be. These authors have written much better books than this one. Give this one a skip.
1,Not Quiet Enough,"I am returning this hairdryer -- that is, if they'll let me; I still haven't received a reply to my request and it's been a week. I tried it once and found it had a high-pitched loud whine which my other ""quiet"" hairdryer fortunately did not have (Sassoon; discontinued). Also, the cords were too short and the light is way too bright."
3,Bright Green Night Light,Some of my household likes the bright green night lite and some do not. I would have like the drier to run a bit stronger and hotter but thats because I have a lot of hair to dry and a beard too.
2,Not that great,Bought this hair dryer a year ago and we need a new one now. It keeps shutting off and it is not dust jammed. The nightlight is really too bright and you cant keep in on the high setting because it gets too hot and you can smell it burning. I think hair dryiers should last longer than this.
3,Andis Hair Dryer,"Install was easy and quick, loved the extra little arm to hang up the excess cord. night light is really bright, I mean REALLY BRIGHT. I think it's ""quiet"" ( as in the lable)is because of the lower speed of the blower motor. I prefer more air moving. Dryer does a good job all in all."
1,Don't buy,I've purchased this hair dryer twice. I like the dryer so when the first one burned out after very little use I thought it was a fluke and purchased another one. The second one also quit working after very little use. I'll never buy another Andis product again.
4,Nice Hair Dryer,Bought this a few weeks ago & really like it. The night light is a good addition to our home. The dryer works great & I like that the counter top is not as cluttered. I would recommend this to anyone.
3,Nice and handy.,"This product was great for a while. The nightlight was really bright. However, about one month of using this product and it just quit."
4,"""as advertised""","I like the designer look of this hair dryer. It is fairly quiet ""as advertised"" and the wall mount certainly adds to the convenience."
2,Would not buy this item again,I like the convenance of it hanging on the wall and the night light is nice. But it doesn't seem like a 1600 watt hair dryer. It has very little power and the power switch tends to turn off if you don't hold the handle just right during use.
4,"Not perfect, but still a good solution","I was very satisfied with the Andis hang-up hairdryer with night lightAndis 30975/HD-10L 1600W Quiet Hangup Hair Dryer with Night Light. A few flaws make it less than 5 stars. Mounting it to the wall was frustrating. The plastic plugs for the screws didn't work, but we bought some from a hardware store and finally got it up. The dryer itself once mounted is absolutely convenient. It was exactly what I wanted to make my bathroom more organized. It does not have as much power as my old handheld, but I wouldn't trade back. The nite light is a value added feature and I love the hook for the cord to keep it off the counter. Worth the price."
5,Very pleased w/ product and delivery was very fast!,"This helps us from having STUFF all on the top of our bathroom countertop, since we have limited counter top in this Bathroom. We had one before that hung on the wall of the bathroom, our motorhome. Great for organization & small places."
3,good but not fantastic,I am wondering how many fantastic reviews one person can write :-)The Schelomo is average compared to e.g. Mork or Rostropovich. Her cello concerto is neither astonishing nor moving at all. What I liked best was the jewish prayer where she lets her C string suffer wonderfully.
4,A great help in time of need,"This book had a cover and was not too old for my purposes. Neither was it marked up or underlined in, etc. However, it seems that the people who wrobte my textbook used the same dictionary, so that I got no further info by looking up a given word. This happened a couple of times so far. On the other hand, I found the many photos, tables, etc. very helpful in addition to finding many word meanings I needed help with. It seems to be a ""nurses'"" book, a kind of watered down materia medica. But, the price was right. How could I complain for 1 penny plus 3.99 shipping. Unless the former owner of the book had Aids or something? I sprayed the book with disinfectant and went on my way. Thanks!"
5,Wind-up clock - no batteries needed,"This clock is compact, has a nice loud alarm, and does not require batteries. I hesitate to use a battery powered alarm clock when traveling, since one never knows when the battery will give out. If you are annoyed by the sound a ticking clock makes this clock would not be for you.The Westclock I had before this lasted for many years (probably over 30 years), and I would still be using it today except for the fact that I lost a cover screw, and could not find a replacement."
4,My dog liked it,My big dog loves the realistic animal sound toys so he has really enjoyed this one. He is not super destructive but he did gut him a little and has started to pull some stuffing out. But this is par for the course on all stuffed toys at our home.
4,My dog lost his mind!... for about five minutes... then the monkey died,"For about five minutes, this was the greatest toy ever. My dog went completely crazy. When we saw that he was ripping it apart, we took it away from him. We couldn't distract him from trying to get it again. We tried his favorite food, commands, everything! We repaired it as best we could and gave it back to him. It took him another 3 minutes to rip it apart.It's been 2 years since I bought one and I'm now buying him one more for his birthday. I'm not poor, but $10 for 5 minutes of enjoyment is a bit excessive.If you've got a less agressive dog, it'll probably be okay. But for a dog like mine who loves to ""KILL"" toys, it won't last long.UPDATE:This product is currently selling through Amazon for $3.xx. If you get free shipping, it's a great deal. Through non-Amazon companies you were forced to pay shipping that made the net cost about $10. I've ordered a half dozen more of these as snacks for my dog!"
3,Somewhat disappointed,"The book itself is okay; however, I didn't realize that the book was going to require a special type of paper in order to create the pop bottle dolls. That was a disappointment because I have never heard of this type of paper. I haven't made an effort to find the paper because purchasing the paper would be an added expense."
2,Big Disappointment,"I was so excited to get this for my son for Christmas but, I was very disappointed with it. First of all, the lid will not stay on and when it falls off it is very difficult to get it back on. I always have to have my husband put it back on and he struggles with it too. Also, once the grill starts talking it doesn't stop and there is no way to stop it. You could simply walk by it and bump it with your toe and you end up listening to it talk for 5 minutes. The worst part of all is that my son rarely plays with it. What a waste of money!!"
3,annoying toy,"As the other reviews have stated, it is an annoying toy. the slightest movemen and the darn thing keeps talking and ""hissing"" and doesnt shut up. You just have to wait it out and pray it will stop talking. and the lid does fall off easily and wont go back on. my 4 yr old played with it a few times and now its just in the way. I was so excited to give it to him, but i guess it wasnt worth the money. I cringe every time i see one in the store...."
2,Playskool Talking Grill,My son received this toy for Christmas from his grandparents. They thought he would love it since he always would play with it in the toy store. But he doesn't seem to like it as much at home. The most annoying thing about this toy is the lid to the grill keeps falling off which makes my son mad he wants the lid on it so I am always having to put it back on. I can't believe they couldn't find a way to make this so the lid would stay on. If we would have kept the box I would have returned this toy.
3,Grrr!,"This was a gift from my sister-in-law. Which is very thoughtful and was very appreciated. That said: My son likes it, for a few minutes anyway. The top that is supposed to swing open, opens and falls off, which makes my toddler upset. There is no ""off"" button, so anything that bumps it gets it going again. That can be very irritating after the baby goes to bed. I don't see any real educational value to it, but my son does like to pretend he grilling like Daddy. All in all, it's not a bad toy, it just needs some re-engineering on the lid and an ""off"" button. I'll be really happy when the batteries die!"
1,Uninteresting and poorly written.,"A huge Simpsons fan, I usually eat up anything associated with the series. Unfortunately, even a die hard like me did not enjoy this book. I have complaints with the writing style and the contents in general. To be quite frank, it reads like a Grade 9 English assignment. Worse yet, it attempts to pass itself off as quasi-intellectual. For the first time, a book somehow managed to iritate me. Ah well, at least it was only 160 pages."
1,COMIC BOOK GUY SAYS...,"""The Wurst Simpsen's Book Eeverr!""This is a SELF-PUBLISHED BOOK. In other words, the author paid to have the book published by a company that would publish a how-to on FREEZE DRYING CRICKETS if you gave them $800. This most likely accounts for the terrible content.Seriously, It's hard to explain just how terribly reasearched, written, and slapped together this text really is. Don't let the 5 * reviews fool you (the author is a college kid with friends who obviously have a lot of free time on their hands).Speaking of comic books, this text is about as heavy as one. It contains a mere 140 pages of, what looks to be, 26 point font.SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
4,Glad I didn't Miss Mom,"Although I do not think that ""Missing Mom"" is Oates's best book, it is certainly very good. As always, Oates treats a subject that, while not unusual, is presented with a unique point of view. The characters are realistic, reacting to situations and behaving in ways which the reader can comprehend. Like many of Oates's books, ""Missing Mom"" reveals its secrets in layers, and what Oates says is true. She understands people and reveals them with their faults, but with sympathy."
1,not hot enough,"The grill does not get hot enough. If the Food is not touching the surface of the grill it doesnt cook. I put it on the highest level...It took 40 minutes to make a hotdog. Unbelievable. Skirt steaks is all its good for because it touches the cooking surface and its thin. Overall, very disappointed."
1,Doesn't Char,"I bought this grill because of all it's positive reviews on this site. I've cooked chicken skewers, lamb chops and burgers on it so far. I couldn't seem to get the grill hot enough to get the outcome I desired (a char crust) even with the lid on. I guess it will have to do for rainy days when I can't use the propane grill outside. I would Look into other grills and specifically their cooking temps. I wouldn't buy this grill if I had a choice to do it again!"
4,Delonghi BG24 Perfecto Indoor Grill,"Product works good. Some people say that it dose not get hot enough, others say that they don't pre-heat it enough. I agree that is not hot enough to grill a big steak.This grill is intended for chicken breast, fish, vegetables. It can't replace a gas grill, but it dose what is advertised for. I'll give it 4* because i'm happy with how it works."
4,good indoor grill,"we love to grill out during the summer so we were looking for a good indoor grill to use during the colder months. this delonghi grill works pretty well - much better than, say, a george forman type of grill. what's nice about the delonghi is that it has a surface similar to an outdoor gas grill instead of solid metal plates that have raised bumps to give the ""grilled appearance"". it does have its limitations though - we can't grill anything like corn on the cob because it doesn't hold in the heat (with the lid on, you only have about a 2 to 3-inch space for food) and it does cook slower than a regular outside grill. it's also pretty time-consuming to clean since you can't submerge the grill itself and food, etc., gets stuck between each bar. however, it does do a really nice job grilling food and keeps everything pretty moist and tender."
3,Nice but a mission to clean,This product is good in general. It is great for it's purpose. My only issue was cleaning this big thing. I do recommend it.
2,Do not recommend for even medium ironing,This is a very nice idea and I enjoy Panasonic products. I did return this item though because this iron wouldn’t stay hot enough for even medium amount of ironing required at full heat setting (one pare of cotton pants & few T-shirts).
5,Finally Free!,I really don't mind ironing as I like my clothes neatly pressed. I hate the cord. Maybe because I'm left handed and a klutz! With this new iron this is no longer an issue. The iron works like a dream. Yes you have to put the iron down on the charging base to keep it hot but that's a small price to pay for not having to deal with the cord. The steam function works really well and I think the detachable water holder thing is brilliant. Love the case it comes in too. Wow I'm so glad I found this product.
4,Very Good Iron,"As far as irons go, this is a great one. Nice not to fool with a cord. Iron stays hot if you remember to put it back in the holder while arranging the clothes."
4,Handy,"It's easy to iron, but you have to continuously to keep charging it while ironing your clothes because it losses charge easily, and that's the only draw back especially if your ironing a bunch of clothes."
3,Only heats for a tiny bit,"I received this iron about 6 months ago. Overall it is a good iron but it does have it's cons. Once it is fully heated (indicated by the indicator light) you can only iron for about 40 seconds before it required heating again. The indicator light will indicate that the iron is still good for further use but in reality it is not hot enough to continue to iron. The steam bursts are strong but will only work 2-3 times per use before needing to be returned to heating pad. This is why I gave it only 3 stars. The pro is that the water container can be removed to refill. The wireless thing is not a seller in my opinion if you have to constituently have to be returning it to the pad. I did, obviously expect to have to do that but not after only about 40 seconds of it being in use."
1,"cordless convenient, functional not","The vertical steam is useless, the cordless functions is convenient, however the ironing potential is very short it will iron an area no longer that the size of a sheet of paper before it cools again needing to be place back in the charging base. Therefore ironing with this iron takes longer, the great feature is that it goes off by itself when idol, making it great for seniors like myself."
3,Panasonic Cordless Iron,"Panasonic NI-L70SR Cordless Steam/dry iron replaced a Maytag cordless iron. I use a cordless iron to press fabrics that I use for quilting. Although better than my previous iron, I was disappointed. It does not get as hot as I would like. However, in defense of the Panasonic, no irons today get as hot as the older irons that are no longer made. I would purchase it again because I need a cordless iron."
4,Nice for what it is,"This is a very convenient iron because it's cordless, obviously, so there's no cord impeding your chore. This makes ironing faster by allowing you to rotate the iron whichever way you want. Also, it makes packing up a breeze - just ditch the water and place the cover back on and you're done. The iron also feels smooth to move around your clothes which I like.Several things I didn't like so much is that it doesn't have as much heat as a corded iron. This means you'll have to iron many clothes right after you dry them and go over a crease more times. The second thing is that the capacity of the tank is pretty low. I find myself refilling the tank more often than other irons I've used.For a cordless iron, it's great. It gets the job done and I'm satisfied. It doesn't beat a corded iron though."
4,Better instructions please,"I have all the functions I want working, but it is really difficult to program. It is not intuitive and the instructions are terrible. When I get home from Afghanistan I will take it to a watch shop to reprogram it. I am satisfied, I will love it when I can program it."
3,The Lost Books of the Bible/Forgotten Books of Eden,"This is a magpies' nest of documents the editors were too stupid to know how to evaluate. L B's of the B: all the books are garbage except Clement, Barbabus, Hermas and the Apostolic Fathers. Outdated translations from the 18th Century. F B's of Eden:Translations from the turn of the 20th Century by JR Harris and RH Charles. Mediocre stuff based on older sources, except the Odes and Psalms, and, to some extent, the Slavonic Enoch.These are worth reading, if you know what you're looking at, which most people don't. If you're not a scholar of the pseudepigrapha, skip this stuff and stick to the Bible, because you won't know how to evaluate this material. Rutherford Platt and J. Alden Brett were two of the stupidest editors ever to hit print, based on their editoral asides in this book."
5,Simple Bowls Are Great,"For the price, perfect for all my cooking and kids' needs. I bought a second box after I got the first, to have enough to use for years. One of the bowls in the first box was broken on arrival, but I didn't really care. Thanks."
1,Didn't work for me,"I've tried the Murad acne skin kit but couldn't continue to use it because it made me break out even more. I am allergic to it and I wouldn't recommend it to people with sensitive skin or have skin allergies. I have tried the gentle proactive formula and it is great, you just have to continue using it daily because if you miss using it a couple times in a row, the breakouts will come back."
2,Dress in not Removable?,"I didn't actually buy this doll. I'm adding this review because of the lady that said the dress was very hard to get off. It doesn't say that on Amazon but I was on a different site selling this doll and the ad said ""costume is not removable"" [...]. So, I didn't buy the doll for my Grandaughter. She likes to change the clothes. Hope this helps. I'd hate to see little girls ruining the dress trying to get if off!"
3,Some very catchy cuts.,"The songs capture the spirit of the movie, which was very entertaining. Best cuts are by the D-Tent Boys (""Dig It""), Shaggy and Devin Thompson. Most of the rest is just okay."
4,Worth every sound that recalls this unusually good PG film,"What a shock when my 9 year old dragged me to this movie. I loved it from first note and visual to end. The soundtrack is almost unpredictably perfect with the film, but like many soundtracks it's uneven away from the overall visual impact. If you see the movie and like it, this is a five star, if not it's a mixed bag that might not make much sense. But let's hear from the 9 year old : ""I really liked this soundtrack! The best songs were Dig It,I will Survive, and down in the valley.But I did not drag him to the movie! But even if I did if I didn't he would of never thought he would have liked it . The same thing happed with Shrek. But thats like his favorite movie! Ohh and Beware kids you have no idea what your parents put on the site about you!"""

5,So worth your money,This album was unusually good. You don't come across an album like this very often. 'Dig It' is my favorite song...I listen to it all the time. Literally. I don't think there is such a thing as not liking this sound-track. If you enjoyed the movie (which everybody I know who saw it did) then you will definetly love this CD. It is worth every penny.
5,The most comfortable shoe ever,I bought this shoe several years ago and though they are very worn and stained I still wear them. I do like to wear socks/tights with them so I didn't find a problem with the sizing- but now they are very streched out. I'm getting a new pair. I like the new detail stitching they've added. And the nubbies on the insoles make me feel like I am getting a foot massage all day. These are the only shoes I've tried that I was not dying to take off at the end of a long day. UP-date. The new shoes have a funny shaped heel which does not tolerate weight shift well. It is not as stable as previous model and prone to turning over when walking. Definitely try on in person before ordering. I didn't. And the new ones don't have the nice nubbies either. Too bad.
3,One of the best resources.,"I found Taber's to be the best medical dictionary I could get my hands on. In fact, it was so good that I would put it second only to all the computer resources that my medical school had at my fingertips. It's useful if you don't have a good computer connection at home."
5,Disturbed is back with a powerfull punch! Believe ROCKS!,"I just got this CD today and I have nothing but good things to say about it. I love the music. The lyrics are great (great job on less EXPLICIT LYRICS, Disturbed!, the CD only has one song with explicit lyrics) and the band has evolved. ... Anyway, I love every song. Especially ""Prayer"" and ""Liberate"". Those are two awesome songs. Here are my suitability ratings:The Explicit Version: Ages 15+ There are explicit lyrics in Liberate, so this is more for mature teens.The Clean (Edited) version: Ages 11+ The clean version instead of having a moment of silence, edits the CD by putting ""MotherMother"" instead which I think is cool.Parents get the clean version for your younger children if you don't like them listening to explicit lyrics. But I highly recommend the clean version because its better for everyone plus that version will not get on anyone's nerves with editing. Well get this CD soon, it will be a big seller!"
2,Not for everyone,"When I received the unit, I was very eager to try it out. Upon opening the package, I was a bit disappointed by the quality of ""chair padding"" but decided to give it a go anyway. The motors were adequately strong in sending off vibrations in the right parts of the body, but it didn't quite do it for me. Usually, I'd prefer stronger, shiatsu-style massages in the massage chairs. If strong vibrations are enough to relieve your stress- this may be for you. It was not for me."
4,Road trips? No more Aches!!,"This back massager is perfect for those long day trips in the car. As a passenger, I get cramped in the seat, and even at 23, my husband says I sometimes get fussy. This massager ended those ache-y cramped feelings. The optional heat is perfect for creating a warm environment for the passenger, while the driver can keep the window open to stay awake. That is the one thing, I would not recommend it to a driver who is tired, as it could relax you enough to fall asleep!. The only problem is, when you try to recline with the massage on, the massagers dont work as well. Mainly a seated massage, but still really good!!!"
1,Turbo Twist,"After spending $.. on Brain Quest and $..on a Math cartridge for my son, we were all extremely disappointed to find out, even though they look exactly alike execpt the color, they are NOT interchangeable. My son can not use the Math cartridge until we go out and spend another $.. on a Math Turbo twist. I have searched the internet and the store and it was not obvious to me that this was the case. If I could I would return all these products. I certainly will Not be buying any more."
2,Good diagrams- but that's all!,"This is a good book to get a beginners understanding of refrigeration equipment. HOWEVER be careful not to buy this paperback edition in hopes that it will give you anything close to the hardcover's information! This is at best a good classroom companion to be used with a teacher at the helm. It is even set up as a lesson and answer book, just like in highschool. I was dissappionted when after the thirty day limit, I cracked the book for the first time and found that I had purchased a highschool coarse book. Good as it would be for that, the description is not clear about it. The hardcover might be the thing you're looking for if you would like good straight forward info."
3,"welcome, genevieve","If this is what it takes to get Genevieve Waite on CD, well, I guess its worth it. Genevieve was John Phillips ex-wife. The two of them collaborated on a long, lost album called Romance is on the Rise. Please, please, please someone!! Find it and release it. I'm sure there are dozens of us out there who will buy hundreds of copies for all our friends.Kudos to who ever it was who thought of using this here."
4,This book presents an adequate introcution to UML.,"Chapter 10 thru 15 present a sufficient introductory view of the subject in a sequentially well defined manner, supported by great diagrams. The appendix example is well tied in with the discussion from chapter 10 and up. However, I am astonished to see the author's reference to Connection as a class. Connection is an INTERFACE, not a class __I assume that, this is a mishap.Well, for the material from chapter 10 an up, I give this effort 8/10."
2,SHIPPING RIP OFF,"I purchased the flip Video and was prompted to consider the carry case which, at 9.95, I thought was worth it. Green wristband was random landfill frankly. Surprised to find I was slugged about 40 for the shipping and even more surprised to see the very same carrying case in my local discount store for 4.95. mmmmm. Buyer beware."
4,Flip Video carrying case review,Great carrying case for my new Flip Video Mino. Velcro strap holds it securely inside of case and padded case protects my Flip Video.
5,Great anime series that came in under the radar,This is an excellent anime series full of action laughs and tears. The reason why this limited edition is priced at 34.99 is because this looks like an original Geneon manufactured DVD which Geneon is out of buisness so its hard to come across this item at actually a low price.
4,"Yeh! It's Bad But, It's Harry!","The stories are charming and Harry's voice was - let's just say - a bit rough but, it's still Harry:) I was happy to serendipitously find it mixed in with audio books at a local discount store. Even when not at his best, he's better than most."
5,I'm 13 and a girl,"Yea, kinda weird, but hey, I love Legos, from the original to the giant Darth Maul I've done 'em all (or at least most of them) this Harry Potter and the Chamber of the Secrets is well worth the money. Plus this set has over 630 pieces (which might not be to much to all of you Lego maniacs)would take you a bit longer then any normal Lego set. I have been trying to complete my Harry Potter Lego collection and only need one more (and counting that I have a gift card it all works out) all of the Harry Potter Legos are outstanding, no matter how small the package may be, so, in conclusion, i reccomend that you buy THIS Lego set, and other Harry Potters, I did. (This set includes Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Ginny Weasley [only in this set], Tom Marvolo Riddle [only in this set], Gilderoy Lockheart [Lockheart is in another set also, but looks rather different], Fawkes [only in this set], Sword of Godrick Gryffindor, The Sorting Hat, The Basilisk [only in this set])"
5,Good belt!,I just used this belt on my dad's Pontiac Vibe (base). The belt had a nice soft rubber look to it like the oem belts. This belt with a new water pump and tesion got that 4-banger nice and quiet again.
4,Beautiful music,"You should buy this album. It's very nice and Joseph sang nice. The chorus was beautiful. I really like track 1, track 3, and track 8. But, overall it's great and worth."
4,Fantastic educational tool for children!!,I bought the Quantum pad & a my first leap pad for my daughters for Christmas this year. I love the fact that you can use both Leap Pad books & Quantum books with this item. My daughter is 4 yrs old & I have to literally pull her away from this toy to get her to do anything!! My 3 yr old LOVES her first leap pad too!!!
3,"Quirky, funky, unique (and sometimes slightly annoying)","I am impressed that this band, consisting of only Jason on drums and Kori on organ, can hold my attention so well. They do so with great drumming--adding funky, unexpected sounds--and harmonious singing of quirky lyrics (which I truly cannot make any sense of myself). ""Proofs"" and ""A Control Group"" are immediately catchy, fun songs, while ""Tan/Black"" is probably the strongest track. My only warning is if you don't like high, loud, sort-of screaming-like female vocals, you may be overwhelmed at times...(Sometimes I get tired of her sound). And also, I agree with the reviewer who found the first and last track really weak. Nonetheless, I like My Solo Project and am looking forward to hearing more from this couple."
3,they're better live,"i first heard about mates from a friend of mine. so i went to their message board and everyone seemed to be amazed by two things: all the noise that two people can make and how in love they are with each other. these things, however, mean very little when it comes to the actual songs. yes, they are a good band and have plenty of potential and yes they are very powerful live. then again so are quasi and royal trux and white stripes and jucifer. while this album has plenty of good tracks, the record on the whole gets a bit boring about halfway through. every song has keyboards and drums. every song has boy/girl vocals either singing in harmonies or octaves etc. that's it. truth be told, they need to spice it up a bit. add a guitar or piano or anything for that matter. again, ignore the volume of their amps and their chemistry on stage and listen to the songs. they're almost there."
3,"An interesting listen, but not infectious","I am not an indie pop devotee, but I heard enough good things about this album to to try it out. In general, the energy of the couple and their willingness to pack musical material into their songs won me over, but their format is inherently limiting. The organ and drums pairing is up-tempo and enjoyable, and the lyrics are fun if not always harmonious. While the set up makes for about three-quarters of a good album, by the end you are a little tired of their sound. Sadly, the biggest problem I have with the album are the two tracks that bookend an otherwise pleasant album with painfully juvenile snippits lifted from a decades old boom-box recording. In some way its silly to let two short tracks sour an entire album, but they are so bad that I find myself starting on track two and and racing to the player to turn it off before track twelve."
1,Nightmare!!,There is nothing in the description that indicates that this is a direct wired product. I did not open the package until we moved to our new home and discovered the mistake. Now I cannot return it because it is past 30 days!!!
3,Dooby's release a good place to start,"Dobbys release is a good place to start collecting harry potter lego i know because thats were i started and im still satisfied. This set includes Lucius Malfoy (Draco Malfoy's father)and dobby the elf (works for Lucius malfoy). With two secret hideouts for money and notes this is a good place to start collect harry potter lego, and do you know what the best thing about lego is .... building it . So good luck buyers."
5,This book is choice!,"I recently took my first DSP class and it was taught by none other than Joyce Van de Vegte herself using this text. DSP has some fairly difficult concepts, but this text explains them very well.Joyce is an excellent instructor, and I find the book is written in the exact same way that she explains them in class. Concepts are explained only as technically as necessary. This makes the text much easier to read and understand the first time around and most technical texts fail in this area."
4,Fun and intresting,"It was a challenge to build, but a good challenge. He's fun to play with and even comes with a storyline! The mask comes off really easily though, wich is the only dawback. I wish I had bought it earlier!"
5,Is it Cold in Here or is it Me?,"Well, Kopaka is Tahu's younger brother. Only because Thau's the oldest out of all Toa, because if you read the information on the trading card game it tells you he is the oldest because is as old as the world. Kopaka lives on top of Mount Ihu which is in Ko Koro...."
1,Man I WISH this thing would work!,"Ok so I work off shore and have a Leatherman flashlight that takes these batteries and they are expensive. I ordered this unit and was happily surprised to find that the thing came with a car adapter that would be perfect for camping along with the charger. Thing is, once I used the battery once it never charged again. That was it. Doneski. I wish it did but no luck so I sent that sucker back. If you need a lithium charger this is nice enough to roll the dice. Some of them gotta work right?"
1,so bad,"Sharon, Lois and Bram rock, and I was very excited to share this video with my kids. I bought it is 'good' condition, and the tape doesn't even play. The tracking is off and you can't see or hear anything that is going on no matter how much you adjust it. The tape was broken garbage that never should have been sold. Seeing as how I only paid like $3.00 I never asked for a refund, although I should have because I think it's not fair for people to send you things that are broken. I didn't think it was worth the hassle of sending back junk that will probably get resold. I threw it away."
5,It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This!!!,"As a professional involved in assisting small and medium sized enterprises to expand internationally, I found Mr. Foley's book to be the most complete and comprehensive guide on the market.A sincere MUST for any international professional.If you have ever considered going global, read this book! Mr. Foley takes you through all of the steps from deciding if you should make that first sale to establishing facilities overseas."
4,Predictable,"This book was ok but a little annoying. I didn't understand why Jessica couldn't get a life and leave her sister's alone. I know Jessica can be a little ditzy at times but you would have thought she'd finally get the picture and leave Elizabeth's and Sam's relationship alone!I don't blame Liz for going to London. And Sam well he was acting like a 2 faced jerk but in a way it was Liz's fault for acting so clingy,she used to be strong but in this book she was acting waay to dependent on Sam. And giving Jessica a boyfriend in this book was stupid because she hardly paid attention to him and when she did it was to complain about Liz and Sam. I also don't understand why this book is a thriller because there was nothing scary or exciting about this book whatsoever. I only reccomend this book to people with patience because the story doesn't turn even remotely interesting until the end."
5,Carl Zeiss Disdem - Opera glasses,"Cosmetically, this item is really neat. I used them at a concert and was not able to see as well with them as I would have liked. They were not overlly priced for what they were intended for. I expected them to work more like my Bausch binoculars."
5,"EXCELLENT, CONCISE,ELEGANT Personal witness on the 12 steps","According to the publisher Fr. Fred is 50 years a jesiut priest,an a member of alcoholics anonymous for almost 40 years. This very well written{especially when you consider they are simply transcriptes of talks],clear rendering of the 12 steps. A great deal of the literature on the 12 steps takes a teacher-student dialogue approach,whereas fr. fred seems to be far more humble,and so much more effective.He breaks down each step chapter by chapetr[his 3rd step,6th and 7th are worth thr price of the book alone].His language is VERY SIMPLE AND CLEAR.I have avidly read almost everything that i can get on the 12 steps, and i agree with the previous reviewer,this is essentila,and BY FAR AND AWAY THE BEST BOOK ON THE 12 STEPs i have read.No preaching, no religion,no oldtimer nostagia[which,unfortunately clutters up some other books.}10 stars,20 stars. This is life affirming stuff."
1,"Do not buy, waste of money","I bought this for use in my road bike. I have had my Garmin Forerunner 305 for 1 year, and I have been using it alternatively with cycling and running. My Forerunner popped out when we had to go thru some rough section of a asphalted road, as we were riding around 30 kmh. My Garmin then got run over by a motorcycle who was following the peloton. Though the Forerunner snapped on tight, it may pop out from the quick release without warning."
4,Minor Complaints,It has two power settings but need a hex head to change the setting. Also didn't like the mounting bracket. The night light stays on all the time instead of having a night sensor. Love the housing for the dryer but the reset button does not seem sturdy. With few improvements and I would give this dryer 5 Stars.
3,Looks good. Works well ... but does not hold up.,"Looks good and works well, but the first one only lasted a year. I took the first one apart and found that the on/off-heat selector switch is very cheap and simply wore out. I only bought the 2nd one because I already have the mounting plate on the wall and thought I might take another chance (hoping that they have improved the switch)). Guess we will see how long the new one will last."
1,Second One,We have had this model on our wall for years. Then we started buying them from Amazon vice other catalogs/sources. Two in two years. Current one purchased July 2006 and broke Nov 2006. These have faulty switches that melt and/or deform. WARRANTY????? First one from Amazon did last 18 months or so.
3,Too expensive for what it actually is,"I was shocked when this arrived. The box was little bigger than a paperback book. I was buying it for my grandson and this was to be his ""big present"". When I saw how little it was, I quickly ordered something else."
5,dawn of the modern world,This is a really addictive game if you like stratagy games and even if you don't its a good challenge. I say everyone should try it at least once
2,uncertain of results,"I tried using this multiple times after reading the reviews, but did not get any noticeable results. Mostly just splotchy. I may have been using it improperly, but don't think so."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD,"This is abother re-release of Sidewalks Fences & Walls, produced by Swamp Dog... don't buy it- Solomon Burke was never paid for this recording and will NEVER perform any of the songs on it."
3,Really not so much for me,"Ordered this on my Kindle. Easy download of course. I think this book is good for the entry level weight training athlete, but not for someone with a few years behind them. I was looking for a way to polish my delt/shoulder sets, and didn't find it."
2,Not exactly what I was looking for.,"While I liked the book, it was not what I was looking for on women's safety. The first few chapters were great. However, the rest of the book goes into a guess the mindset for women and how they need to change the way culture teaches them to be victims. Maybe being a guy might have cut the connection."
5,Hank Med,"Royal Pains is such a great series. It has humor, drama, relationships, and of course medical situations for Hank and his brother, Evan, to handle. It has all of the right stuff to be a success. My husband and I both really enjoy this show."
5,Great!!!,I loved this show. I wonder why they have discontinued it. It has always a positive message and the right amount of drama.
3,Nearly Impossible To Get iPod Out,"Pros: Looks very cool, can use all ports, and is very protectiveCons: Nearly impossible to get iPod outOverall: It is not that great because if you want to change the case it is not easy"
2,It was supposed to be new!,The item was supposed to be new but it wasn't! The cd sleeve had what looked like food stains on it...and the box the software came in wasn't even sealed shut. The package was also sent in paper wrapping and received a huge hole in the box and wrapping. I'm surprised that the cd wasn't damaged! This item was not new and the box the software came in should have been send in another box so that it wouldn't have received a hold in the middle of the box through shipping. I am very dissapointed with the services. I'm just thankful the software works.
2,Awful Music,I didn't care for this Cd at all. I'm giving it away after the first time of listening to it.
2,Ok book.,The book was a little hard to understand the material. I used the book maybe 2 times during the course of my Optimal Control semester. I wouldn't recommend this book unless its all you could find!
5,A Peek at a Little Known Corner of the War,"Excellent storytelling of a little known effort, early in World War Two, to get airplanes from North American factories to Great Britain in those desperate days when she stood alone against Nazi Germany after all the other western European nations were under Hitler's regime. What may surprise viewers is the extent of American involvement in what was labeled a Royal Air Force program. This documentary was made be the son of one of the program's most influential and respected participants. Highly factual and entertaining."
4,JLU,"This is a great value for 3 figures in one package for a low price as compared to buying them separately. I like the more posable Flash because you can make him look like he's really running. The details on all of the figures resemble the cartoon very well. My only complaint is that Dr. Fate is a little shorter than the other two figures ( and most of my other JL figures in fact, and it doesn't stand on its own that great unless you bend him backwards. Green Arrow and Flash support themselves very well. I wish some accessories were included like GA's bow or the accessory that comes with the single Dr. Fate."
1,OVERPRICED !!,this item is available for under $18 on chris' website. where does this outragious price come from? go to his site & save a bundle.
5,Convenient & Simple,"I have bought these for my toddler son & love them. They are easy enough for dads, grandparents & sitters. Slip in a liner for naps, or heavy wetters (like my son..) & go. Easy to carry in the diaper bag & even easier to wash. Fold the velcro back on itself & wash w/your detergent & maybe some washing soda. Don't bleach or use fabric softener. Just as simple as disposables, but w/out the big, heavy, stinky bags of old disposables! Just throw in wash when needed. For extra savings - make your own wipes!"
4,Bravo! Buon lavoro!,"This Italian trio has always made me smile and dance. This CD is no exception. I feel that this CD was a step back for them, however. It is good, but the music is a return to the glory of ""Blue"". Particularly ""Cosa Restera"". Oh Nostalgia. I think that the best CD they have made is Contact. They broke quite a bit of new ground on that CD. Having said this, I do love the fact that the songs are mostly in Italian. In the deluxe edition, the English versions and some remixes are also included. Not only is the music upbeat and catchy the lyrics have good messages. Today/Oggi is very inspirational. It is too bad they had to break up but ""così è la vita"". At least we have the new group Bloom 06 which came out of the ashes."
4,Mainemary,A look at politics in most primitive but still relevant manner. I first was impressed with this video on PBS years ago but the message resonates every time a new set of political campaigns assault again.
4,Interesting but limited,"First, a warning: I am interested both in baking delicious bread and understanding some of what's happening in my bread in the process of making it. And I bake almost entirely sourdough.I thought that parts of this book were interesting. It certainly has gorgeous pictures of delicious looking bread. The descriptions of bakeries were wonderful. What I found odd was that the descriptions of why some things are done (especially in the sourdough and rye chapters) seemed a little weak. And I didn't think that the recipes were very interesting.The take home parts of this book were, for me: (1) the descriptions of how the bakers operate, what they do to their bread. Those gave me ideas to try on my own bread. (2) It is a beautiful coffee table book. I've seen none better on bread..However, if I wanted to learn more about BREAD, I would go to something like Bread Builders by Daniel Wing and Allen Scott or some analogous book for yeasted breads."
5,NERDS FOREVER!,"A touching and hillarrious sequal. It's filled with even more classic Nerd action, fun filled humor and drama then the first."
3,Who Edited This?,"These recipes are great--realistic food for real people who haven't a clue what lemongrass is--but who edited this book? It's filled with rambling, pointless stories and just terrible grammar, making it handy to flip through but a painful read."
4,"Love the ""Way Back"" machine concept.","I actually find this movie entertaining in the fact that they for once address the time when Pokemon lived with humans as servants rather than the beloved companions they are frequently protrayed as in the anime. It's interesting to see that ancient humans fear or don't fully comprehend the mysterious powers Pokemon have and call them ""Magical Creatures"" (which is adorable) in reference to this."
4,Good for ... non-geeks,"This book makes you feel very safe when you first jump into Linux by providing you installation discs of Fedora Core and giving you background info on how things are done in the world of Linux. For instance it tells you how installing programs works, which is surprisingly very different from Windows, and it gives you step by step instructions on doing basic things like that.Although this book is good at showing you how to do things you once did in other operating systems - which may be good enough at first - I felt undereducated. It didn't really tell you how the core of Linux works. Good primer, but you need to do your own exploring to know it all it seems."
3,good game but dated,"I believe that this is the Command & Conquer Red Alert Arsenal which is the Red Alert Game along with the Aftermath add on disc. If so, this was a really cool game for it's time. It is a real time strategy game, a genre made popular by the original Command & Conquer game. I really enjoyed it. Since it came out, it has been greatly surpassed by newer games including Starcraft and Homeworld and more recently by even better games like Shogun and Red Alert 2. If you want the newest, latest game, this is the wrong game. If you don't care about having the most current thing or have an older computer that can't handle the newer games, this game can provide hours of fun. It is especially good as a multiplayer game."
4,Actually Use as Cloth Diapers!,"I'm sure these diapers do make lovely burp cloths, but if you are interested in cloth diapering, don't be afraid to try these. They are thicker than the Gerber prefolds and are quite absorbant. My 14-month-old is a heavy wetter and I can use these with a Kushies doubler and a wrap with no leaks. Also, these diapers don't have any rough sewn edges, so baby's skin is protected. They fluff nicely after the first few washes."
5,"great for diapering, too!","Believe it or not, these things actually make great ... diapers! I've also tried flat diapers and another brand of pre-folds with birds-eye weave, but these are far more absorbant than either. Also, the stitched ""pre-fold"" in the Kooshies is narrower than other brands I've seen, so they fit better and baby doesn't look like he should be wearing chaps and a cowboy hat. Yo,Partner. The only thing I *don't* like is that, due to the robustness of the flannel, it's harder to get diaper pins through, but storing pins stuck in a bar of soap helps."
5,Make Great Blankies!!!,"Our daughter used these as burp rags at first. Then, she began to use them as security blankets. Now, at two years, she still carries one around with her. We also keep one in her bed. These are great, because you don't have to worry about losing a precious blankie. They all look and feel the same, so if one is misplaced, there is always another to take its place. We'd be in trouble without them!!"
2,Leaves much to be desired,"These are very unpracticle cloth diapers, but I do use them to clip onto teh bottom of my swiffer! Way too big for younger infants and difficult to get a good fit on any kid. Leaves much to be desired in the world of cloth diapering."
4,Sixty Hikes,"I like to refer to this guide for hiking weekend outings in my area and back it up with the Golden Gate Trailblazer guide which details all the trails in Marin County and San Francisco. I'm staying closer to home now that our small kids rule the roost. Family hikes are in both, hard as well as easy."
1,this is not an honorable documentary filmmaker,he posted his own promotional photo on our Amazon website which had the address of his own website and misrepresented the Indian tribe from our film - then he negatively reviewed our DVD to promote his own DVDs - so this is not an ethical man and based on this behavior I would not be surprised if his anthropological films were staged
5,Awesome kids rock cd!,"My kids and I LOVE this CD. This is more of a rock cd compared to the other Boynton CDs (Phila Chickens, Rhino Tap) that are kids music. Blue Moo is more on this level - but 50's & 60's style music. My favorite song is DOg Train - but I guess that is because I love the Blues Travelers. There are other great artists on there - Hootie & the Blowfish, the Spin Doctors, the Bacon Brothers, etc. This is a CD that I can listen to and enjoy. Some of the music that my kids listen to is very child-like which is fine - but sometimes I just can't listen to that kind of music in the car. I need something that won't drive me crazy when I am singing it in my head for the rest of the day."
4,It grows on you!,"My now 8mo daughter received this for Christmas. At first, I wasn't as crazy about it as the Philadelphia Chickens CD. However, it's made its way into the vehicle's music rotation and has grown on me. There are very few CDs that my daughter will tolerate, and this is one of them. It took some time for me to warm up to the CD, but most of the songs are amusing. I do find the Cow Planet songs irritating, and consequently they are skipped, hence the 4-star rating."
2,Home Sausage Making,"There are many recipes for sausage making in this book, but those that I've tried were not really great. It's an informative book, but I'm not crazy about the recipes."
2,Its ok,"This game is complex its not even fun to find out all the options. What is anoying is that when u in middle of the game u have so many units and u have to give a command to every single one of them, yes u can automize them but that will do no good to ur military units. Some times if ur lucky the gamefun will be 3 stars but most of the levels i played turnd out to be boring either i lost fast or it was 2 easy. Also sometimes when the game is over anyways and one of the leaders has clearly won, the game still goes on for an hour. Dont forget the game is more then 3 years old get something better for ur money for example:""Warlords Battlecry"" or ""Cossaks European Wars"". I dont recommend this game though its not catastrophic either!"
1,Oops!,"Suckered by the glowing reviews already on file, I bought this book, but was immediately alarmed to note numerous typos and weird grammatical errors. I couldn't even make it halfway through before giving up in frustration.Clovis Bracey, I wish you well, but next time for God's sake get an editor! There may be a good story in there, but I couldn't dig through the poor typesetting and amateurish presentation to find it.Sorry, but this is not worth paying money for."
1,Cheaply Made Piece of Crap,"My reason for buying this was because my mom had accidentally put my old DJ ditty through the washing machine, a week later, i got my brand new one, it was a complete piece of crap! when I turned it on and put my headphones in, 85% of the screen would go to black & the sound only came out in 1 ear bud, finally after a week, I went to Fred Meyer and bought a Phillips Go Gear RaGa, they are much better than the ditty."
3,"Ok, but I'm springing for an iPod.","I bought the DJ Ditty on discount for $69 because I wanted to try it out and see if I'd actually use it. As it turns out I use it quiet often. I haven't experienced the problems the other reviews have and I've had it for about 6-months. What I do hate is the low battery life and having to always plug it into my computer. I use Yahoo! Music Engine for my music and if you don't buy the song you have to plug the player in every month to renew the license. That's a pain. I've decided it will be less time consuming to buy an iPod, buy the music and join the masses as an iPod junkie.Horrible product and that's why the discontinued it. Stop right here and go buy an Ipod."
3,Great gun if you could get nails,The gun would be great if you could get nails for it.No stores or home improvement centers carry the full round head nails You have to order it from out west They should tell you this when you buy the gun i would have got the N88WW. You can get clipped head nails for that gun.If you live on the east coast don't get the N88RH get the N88WW.
4,The American Beatles Indeed!,These guys still rock! Faithful version with the usual Tricks'. Guests and backup are equally talented and enthusiastic. Camera work and sound (hope it's Co-Producer Geoff's) are above average (similar to Soundstage format). Buy it and have fun!
5,A great book!!,I am a seventh grade school teacher in an urban school setting in New Jersey. This book help me to encourage my students to reach for the stars in they're goals for life. The characters in this book made it with all of the chaos that surrounded them and turned out to be assets to their community.
3,Missing minutes,"I purchased the series as a gift since my family enjoyed it so much. The collections great, but as we were watching the last episode, we were wondering what happened to a few scenes that were not there. There are ten minutes that were cut. We watched it on netflicks so if you are not familiar with the series you might consider another way to watch the finale."
3,nice if you want to stay amature,"These balls look great, the color and numbers on them are very detailed.However if you go to your local pool hall to play, you'll notice a huge difference right-away: the balls at the pool hall are heavier in weight and more dense in material (feels more professional), they have less deflection when you hit them so your english on the cue ball aren't exaggerated. I noticed this, returned them and did some research... in a nut-shell if you want to practice with real pool balls and get better at the game you should look for the ""Aramith Super-pro"" or ""Super-pro TV series"".If you just want a set of nice looking pool balls for your table at home, but don't really care to get better at the game, then these are perfect."
1,False advertising -- avoid this disc!,"This Blu-Ray disc is a waste of time and money, and the description is blatantly false and misleading. This disc does NOTHING to show off an HDTV system, either visually or aurally. The images are nothing more than one-minute film loops of incredibly uninspired scenes, and they are NOT in 1080i. Clarity is terrible, and the sound track is abysmal. Whoever gave this disc 5 stars either works for the company unloading this garbage, or has absolutely no clue about HDTV and surround sound."
1,Miserable Charging Experience,"I do not recommend this charger--it doesn't have any sort of mechanism to keep it plugged into the phone, so it's constantly falling out if the phone gets moved at all. This is not convenient, especially for users that are talking on the phone and driving at the same time."
1,Not as pictured or described,"I thought this price was too good to be true. The title of ""Handspring Treo 650/755P Car Battery Charger / Adapter"", the link to ""Other products by Handspring"", the picture displayed all implied that this was an authentic adapter by the real company.What got shipped to me was a cheap clone which didn't look at all like the picture, has a short, thin cord, and feels like it's going to fall apart in a couple months just like the other cheap clone Treo car chargers I have purchased in the past."
4,Works well at the moment.,"So far my dog hasn't broken into this and the casters haven't snapped off. I can see either becoming the case with enough use, however. I have a yellow lab who is no dummy and fairly adept with his paws - a simple ""standing stretch"" against the underside of the latch would easily pop the lid. If he decided to do any leaning, charging, etc., he easily could knock a full container over and I don't want to think about the rest. Actually, even without tripping the light-clamping handle latch, if this were knocked over full, I can't imagine it would stay closed. The casters are light duty, all-plastic (except axle) - not even as substantial as those on the cheapest task chairs, quantities over 50lbs are going to seriously test their strength.All that aside, I store this under a counter and the wheels only get short movement daily, so this is working well for me."
1,Received a broken lid,"This product is great size and exactly what I needed. However, the packaging was inadequate perhaps: the lid was broken when I opened the package. Very disappointed. Giving 1 star because I received a defective product."
3,"It's a good container, BUT...","My latch, as others have mentioned is very loose. Something airtight should close solidly. I literally can open this with my pinky. I remedy this by placing a brick on the top to weigh it down a bit. The seal around the top seems sufficient; if only the latch were to close properly. It is still a decent value, as other products (that probably have good latches!) are much pricier. I simply could not spend that much for a plastic container to hold dog food."
3,Solid Container,"I bought this container hoping to fit a 30lb bag of dog food inside. Unfortunately, only about 25lbs actually fits. However, the container is airtight and doesn't look cheaply made.If I could purchase it again, I would buy the next size up."
5,Does its job,"I'd have preferred this style a little bigger, but the bigger ones have wheels. That, I definitely didn't want. This one works very well, is sturdy, and seals the food in. Not much more I can say, it does what it's supposed to do. Good purchase."
4,Exactly what I wanted,"This was exactly what I was looking for when I ordered this. It is large, fits well over a huge bag of food with room to spare. Meaning when I get down to the bottom, only a few days of food left I can put a full bag on top of it and never have to wait until its completely dry. The lid and latch seem to work very well. Overall Im quite pleased!"
5,Perfect size,"This is a very nice container, rolls well even when completely full, the lid closes tightly yet is easy to open. I mostly wanted this size container so it would fit an entire 50-lb bag of dog food that I buy at Sam's, which it does perfectly. No more messing with that massive bag time after time!"
3,smaller than I thought,"I bought this because it said that the 47 quart container would hold 40 lbs. of dog food. It actually only holds about 37 lbs. and now I'm stuck with 3 lbs. that I don't want to throw away but I have nowhere to store. The lid is also a looser fit than I would have liked because I have smart dogs, and I know that they're going to figure out how to knock the lid off. On the bright side, it rolls really easily and looks quite nice."
4,Pet Food Storage Container,"I feed a number of stray cats, and I needed a huge container to hold a 21.6 pound bag of dry cat food. This container is perfect. I drop the bag of food into the container and cut the top of the bag off. The container keeps the food fresh for a long time. One of the wheels on the container does have a habit of falling off occasionally, but it's not a big deal."
2,Broken Lid,Great sized bin but the lid hinge broke within a week worth of use. It seems to be pretty weak plastic in the area and with opening and closing the lid several times a day it broke.
3,I just bought 2 of these...,"I bought an Iris 45qt bin several years ago to store dry cat food and absolutely love it. It worked so well that I bought a 60qt for dry dog food about a year ago. It has also worked wonderfully. I recently decided to buy two more to store bird seed, so I bought two 45qt models from Amazon about a week ago. They arrived two days ago and my first impression is not good. The construction of these models vs. the older 45qt model does not seem to be as good or solid. The handle on the lid is definitely not of the same construction and has a very cheap, light-plastic feel. Even the side walls seem to be thinner and flimsier. I have serious doubts about how long it will hold up over everyday use.I'll post a follow-up review in a few weeks with an update."
3,Kim,This movie is a great story and reasonbaly priced on Amazon Prime. The acting is a bit dated or shall I say stilted? Moldy? And it moves sort of slow. I thought it worth watching and now I plan to read the book on my Kindle.
3,"Lots of Pros, a few Cons","This camera works fine as long as you use Internet Explorer and follow the obscure instructions on the webpage that appears when the camera is found. If you are a Firefox devotee, you will be disappointed as you need to use MSIE to set this up. Infrared works good out to about 14'. Microphone is great too. Focusing is hit and miss. Drove me crazy getting it just right. This will also accept an SD card which is nice. All in all a good camera. Just don't spend more than $70 USD for it."
2,"OK, with limitations","If you're looking for a simple network camera that can be used for monitoring purposes then this is ideal, but with a couple of warnings:Build quality is not great.The cheap lens results in a picture that is about the same quality as most reversing cameras - OK, but nothing special.Software requires Internet Explorer to view it. Even with IE, many configurations (at work for example) prohibit the installation of ActiveX controls - where this is the case, you won't see your camera.Forget using it with a security system such as Zoneminder.Overall, it get's a OK. As a baby monitor or for other simple use it's fine. If you want more flexibility and a better quality image, look at paying a bit more for something like an Axis 206"
1,Disappointed,"I'm very disappointed not so much in the camera, but in the company Swann.. I'm the Founder/President of NorCal Paranormal Investigators, Inc. and wanted to use these cameras in our investigations. The only problem is my lap top has the new Vista Windows program and Swann neglected to inform me that these cameras are not compatible. I have in the last 3 months asked Swann to inform me if they have the software yet and I keep getting the brush off that they are working on it, but has no ETA as to when they will have it. If I'm going to use them I'll need to buy a rebuild lap top with a windows 2000 or xp.."
4,A powerful description of the neglect we show the elderly.,This novel tells the story of neglect and rejection of one elderly person-Caroline Spencer. Spencer is left in a rest home by her brother and callous sister in law. She commits to writing her cruel experiences in a journal. She reflects of how she lived her life and contemplates on the harsh and humiliating treatment that the nursing staff give the elderly in the home. She displays rightous indignation at the neglect and callous treatment on the elderly by the nursing staff and by society at large. This novel makes the reader realize how much society has neglected our elderly and basically abandoned our elderly love ones. Sarton writes with great skill. The novel has a powerful and meaningful ending that will make you think and reflect on the worth of quality care for the elderly and of life itself.
5,It'll grow on you... fast!,"Some CD's you buy don't stay in your CD player very long, while others manage to stay in there for quite a while before you want to take them out. This is one of those CD's that has that kind of lasting power and replay value. It's a great album, with a range of upbeat offerings and some slower songs to round out the album. Songs such as ""Red Dawn"", ""Sorrows"", ""The Ocean's Wide"", ""Destiny's Line"" and ""The Final Song"" are personal favorites. If you like strong melodic vocals and electronic pop music, such as Camouflage and De/Vision, then this CD is right up your alley!"
3,Beautiful Music,"Classic tunes done very simply, but throughout the CD the same instruments were used for every tune....but then, it is supposed to be ballroom dance music."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,My 3 year old can open this gate with ease. It doesn't serve any purpose at all. It's a shame this product is listed under safety gate.
3,Doesn't last as long as you would like,"I really like the look of this gate. At first I would have rated it a 5, but with only 4 months use, our two year old was able to break the latch device on the bottom. Now one gate swings freely, and the other we have swings freely in one direction. Also, even though I tightened the gate as tight as humanly possible, the upper latch never really catches with all of the work being done by the now worthless lower latch. When it worked, it was nice, but no longer."
4,Great,Love that the product is pleasing to the eye. We wish it came with more attachments as it's too narrow for the frames in our home where we want to use it. But I've seen attachments for sale so we'll go that route
4,Nice gate,Seems sturdy and like it'll last for as long as I need it to. Was a little difficult to get it set up correctly.
2,missing pieces!!,"I'm usually satisfied with my Amazon purchases, but we were very disappointed to find pieces missing from this baby gate. We didn't get a chance to try this gate becuase the box arrived without the upper locking set, rendering it useless. Most likely it had been returned by another customer who didn't care, as long as they received their refund. I will now only purchase toys, etc. online because I can't stand having to return things! For baby gates and similar items, we will go to a store and visually inspect before purchasing, rather than rely on other parties to ensure all pieces are included."
2,"Lacking something overall, not as good as the Sookie books","I read this after loving all of the Sookie Stackhouse books and hating the Harper (Grave Sight et al) character and books. I was hoping to find a middle ground here that would have some of the same humor and finesse of Sookie's stories without the melodrama and creepy relationships of the Harper stories. Sadly, this book and Aurora left me cold. Real Murders felt like a book for teens. Aurora is lacking confidence, she has no panache and none of the real world intelligence that makes Sookie so real and a character you actually want to know more about."
4,GEORGIAN REAL MURDERS,"The first book in the Aurora Teagarden Mystery Series. This is the first book of Charlaine Harrris' that I have read. I enjoyed her writing and will be reading the rest of the books in this series. This series is NOT vampires. The main character is a librarian (28 years old) in a small town in Georgia. She belongs to a study group of citizens called ""Real Murders"". All of sudden there are murders in this town and they are staged to look like famous historical murders."
5,Charlaine Harris Novels,All of Charlaine Harris Novels are great. I have read alot of her series and I love them. Amazon has good pricing on them and free shipping once you order around $30. So I can always get a few at a time and not have to actually go shopping for them.
3,"Good, but not as compelling as Sookie Stackhouse or Harper Connelly","I read the Sookie Stackhouse novels and Harper Connelly and loved them both. I really wanted to like this series as well but so far, I'm feeling ""feh"" about it. The character herself, Aurora, isn't very deep and what I mean by that is that I don't really find myself getting attached to her, not like I did with Sookie or Harper. I want her to be more interesting, have more to say. Also, although her love life adds additional interest to the story, it's pretty tepid. Unlike Harper or Sookie, Ms. Harris doesn't really go into too much depth there. I feel like perhaps this is because this was written some 18 years ago and clearly Ms. Harris has developed her style since then. I am interested enough however to keep reading, I am on the second book in the series now and I am hoping my interest in the series will increase."
3,very generic,"I've read several of Harris's other books, and while the mystery here was at least good enough for me to finish the book, I was disappointed. It was just very generic. And the ending made no sense at all---no motive is ever explained, and the perfectly normal people who turn out to be the killers suddenly descend into raving lunacy in the last few pages. It just didn't fit. The murders themselves are absurd, but at least interesting, and I could have done that if the whole series packed more of a punch than it does. My response after putting the book down: meh."
2,Bloody Vanilla---,"A bad mixture: bland story with an even blander ending, flat characters--especially the heroine, and several bloody murders. Couldn't believe this came from Charlaine Harris."
2,Disappointed,"I loved the Sookie Stackhouse series so I thought I would check out more of Charlaine Harris' books. I was very disappointed by this book. I had a hard time getting into it and felt that there were too many characters to keep track of. I thought that the character development was very slow and mundane. I got almost half way through and found myself not really paying attention to what I was reading. I really wanted to enjoy it, but just couldn't get there..."
1,Snooze.,"I love Charlaine's work. I love her Sookie series, I love her Harper and Tolliver books, I love her Lily Bard series.I do not love Aurora. Usually with Charlaine's work I am immediately drawn the the story and characters but this didn't happen with this book. But, I wanted to love this, but by chapter 3, I kept noticing I would just end up reading the same paragraphs over and over not paying attention to the words at all my mind somewhere else, because this book was just a drab. I just skipped to the end to see what would happen. It was too ""cozy"" for me, I suppose."
2,Not as good as it could be,"I love Sookie Stackhouse and Harper Connolly so I really wanted to like Aurora Teagarden. Unfortunately, the writing was just so stiff and formal-- I could never sink into the series. I wasn't particularly interested in Aurora or her social life. They subsidiary characters seemed sort of bare bones and vague. I think Charlaine can do much better."
5,excellent,This book and Jess's diary too are both page turning.I think this is the book in that Elizabeth and Todd are part of a wedding party...Well I dont know...groan...i read all the books so i cant remember
5,Just an exceptional golf game. Nothing can compare.,"I have played a lot of golf games in the past, but NOTHING can compare to this. EA Sports has done an AMAZING job on the Tiger Woods PGA Tour series. The gameplay is exceptional. The course designs and layouts are VERY realistic. From TPC at Sawgrass' famous island green at the 17th to Pebble Beach's 18th hole. The golfer's motions in the different swings are timed very well. With 15 different courses to choose from, it also gives a very wide selection in courses ranging in difficulty. And if you expand with Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2000, 2001, and their expansion packs, it makes the selection even larger. An imperfect golf simulation. No other golf simulation can compare to this series. And at an amazing price. DEFINITELY worth buying."
3,Interesting Book,I got this book to help my Husband and I drop a few pounds. It has a lot of recipes that sounded very interesting. But every one of the recipes is for 4 servings. Some of the dinners would not be very good as leftovers. The breakfast I found were to much work on hectic work days. If you have the time to reduce the recipe and like larger breakfasts and lunches then this book is for you.
1,Very disappointed in this book,I thought this book would have easy to follow recipes that were easy to prepare and didn't require a lot of ingredients. That's not what I got at all. I haven't even used a single recipe from this book because they are too involved and require ingredients that I don't have on hand. I spend enough money on food just cook every day and the last thing I need to do is spend more money on ingredients I will only use for one recipe. I'll just stick to web site recipes; they are much easier to follow and usually have ingredients that I already have on hand.
1,NOT AVAILABLE,"I ordered this item for my husband for Christmas...Well it arrived today and it is the wrong one. They sent a 1/2' drill instead of the 3/8"". They said it was a substitution because the 3/8"" is discontinued. They didn't even contact me to see if it would be ok to substitute. Now I have to wait for my account to be credited and probably have to pay the shipping to send the wrong item back...........merry christmas!"
4,"""Men"" was very enjoyable","I caught this movie on the Independent Film channel and was thoroughly delighted. With the disclaimer that I am not terribly experienced with foreign films, I loved the feel of the movie: it was clearly not from Hollywood! The movie has some serious themes but the many laughs bring it to a level that has a wide appeal. I would definitely recommend ""Men"" to anyone who is wanting to experience something outside of typical Hollywood fare; this movie will satisfy that craving without going over your head."
2,"Serious subject, flawed movie","Two of my favorite actors are Sandra Bullock and Tom Hanks. And just think, here they are, together in the same movie...sort of.The story, about a child who's convinced his father (who dies in the Twin Towers) left him coded messages, didn't work. To me, the kid seemed like a self-absorbed brat. I just couldn't generate much sympathy for a character who seems to think that the whole 9/11 attacks took place just to disrupt his world.More screen time for Sandra Bullock might have helped. I couldn't help but feel for her character, a woman who loses her husband to terrorists and her kid to an obsession.Tom Hanks is good (as always; I even liked him in Larry Crowne), in a role that we mostly see or hear through recordings.I think there's a place for a story about the effects of 9/11 on children, but this movie isn't it, at least not for me."
4,Extremely Loud & Incredibly,To Order movies we could watch. with tom hank and bulllsonk in the movies.Is a story. You could watch.
1,Too Artsy for My Taste,"I suppose it is blasphemous to be critical of a movie with Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock and Max von Sydow, but I found the script pretentious and the acting over the top."
2,Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,"Yes, that is exactly what it was. I did not care at all for this movie and it was way to long and dragged out. Tom Hanks is the only good thing about this film and he was not in it long enough to be bothered watching."
4,Uplifting,"This is the kind of beautiful movie that I come across every once in a while that keeps my watching movies. Most films are about misery, fast driving and explosions. This one's about life."
1,Forgettable,"Just as the title of my review states, this movie is very forgettable. The story did not do much for me personally. Personally, I wouldn't watch this movie again, nor do I recommend it."
1,Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,"Considering it was based on the novel of the same name by Jonathan Safran Foer, the young writer whose success has polarized a portion of the literary community, it's not surprising that Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close has had nearly the same effect on most people. The only film nominated for this year's Best Picture Oscar that I would give 1 star, Extremely Loud stars former Kids Jeopardy! winner-turned-actor Thomas Horn as Oskar Schell, son of a 9/11 victim, who must learn to cope with life in the wake of his father's death. A year after the tragedy, when Oskar discovers a mysterious key among his father's belongings, he sets out to discover what it unlocks. Extremely Loud is a worthy story to tell, but director Stephen Daldry tells it in such a pretentious and shamelessly sentimental fashion as to make it distasteful."
3,Why did I pre order?,"Wanted to love ,this. Love Tom H's other movies, but this one was just ok. The trailers were the best scenes."
2,Oddball movie,"I did not particularly enjoy this movie. I found the child to be so precocious as to be completely annoying and the scenarios too unrealistic (who would let a kid that age roam all over NYC by himself, let alone get in cars with people whom he barely knows?). A little too far out for me. Used to be you could pick up a Tom Hanks movie and it was always good; now it seems, not so much."
2,It Sucked,"Sorry, but it sucked. Good actors do eventually get stuck with a script that does not work. I could not even finish the movie it was so boring. But you can find out for yourself cause everyone has an opinion."
1,Disappointing,hard to read text - no pictures of food itemsthey are makign me put in more wordsto postso just typing more words now
3,lack of any photography,"I haven't yet tried any of these recipes - most reviewers have commented that the recipes are wonderful - but I must say I was instantly disappointed in the appearance of the book - I really expect cookbooks, especially when they are about foods that may not be familiar to everyone - to have wonderful photography and this book is absolutely devoid of photos...."
2,"Leaks, stiff, and not absorband","Not a very good cloth diaper. The inserts are very inefficient in pulling moisture away from the baby's bottom. This can result in diaper rashes. You might as well use prefolds and use a cover and save LOTS of money rather than use these diapers.Besides all the leaks with this diaper, they are really stiff. I wanted to like this diaper, but am very disappointed. We are much happier with Happy Heiny's and BumGenius for All-In-Ones."
4,"Good, affordable, reliable diaper","I used these diapers for my first child. They are extremely durable and very well made. I did not have any leaks with these diapers and do not have any stains or tears from having used them for over a year now. I found that if I thew in a dry towel with the diapers in the dryer, they would dry much quicker. I have a large deck and often times I would dry the diapers and inserts on my deck out in sun, then throw them in the dryer later to soften them up. With my second child I've switched to BumGenius diapers. The thing about Kushies diapers is that once the diaper is wet, it's wet. I wish the inner lining of Kushies was a fleece liner, to wick away the moisture (the way BumGenius diapers are). You can't beat Kushies' price. But if you want a diaper that will keep your baby's skin dry against the diaper, you don't want Kushies. BumGenius has been wonderful because it's keeps my baby's bottom nice and dry and it comes in a size that grows with your child (10lbs-35lbs)"
2,Will be great later,"I bought these diapers for my 2 month old after reading great reviews. The infant size is listed for 10-22 pounds, which is quite a range in weight. My daughter currently weighs 13 pounds and these diapers are just enormous on her. I pulled them up as high as they would go (nearly to her armpits) and the leg holes were still gaping around her thighs.I do think these will be fabulous once she is a little bigger."
3,Not the best,"These diapers hold in what they're supposed to, but they are rather bulky. It's very uncomfortable to put clothes on my 21 month old over these. I haven't tried them overnight, but during the day, when he's home I let him run around the house with them on and they seem to hold everything in. Also there is no stretch around the waist at all, making it difficult to get a good snug fit."
2,not as convenient as cloth diapers,"They are nice looking, but not as convenient as cloth diapers. they recommend that you purchase liners for them as well, which I had, but there are built in liners that are not removable. they do not dry well in the dryer, and they are super bulky. We stick to using cloth diapers, and only use these at night with a cloth diaper underneath in case of late night accidents."
5,dont listen to the screwball who wrote the other review,if you like trance get this cd it kicks a$$ i love trance alot and techno and house so i can rate stuff more opened minded than that other fruit cake
3,Mid-grade techno from an unusual background.,"This provides a good listen but nothing extraordinary. It is very electronic and synthy, perhaps behind in the times from that standpoint, but I have no problem with that."
4,Holy Die-cast Batmobile Batman!,"This is a must-have item for the Bat-fan. Great detail (though it's not 100% accurate, it's close enough) and it's nice and heavy. All in all a fantastic addition to any collection (now, who wants to make scale models of Adam West and Burt Ward to fit in it?)"
1,Highly dissappointing video!!!,"Being a fan of Nina's fellatio videos I was so excited to see this one come out. Femdom is a subject of interest to me and I thought this may be informative and helpful. Boy was I wrong!!!I don't think that I learned anything at all from it. Basically, all I found it to be was a mediocre porn film that oddly enough is extremely lacking in female domination. I wouldn't suggest this to anyone wanting to learn about this subject. Bad, bad, bad!"
1,Not for mechanics,"These gloves are terrible they tear if you touch them, i wouldn't recommend them to anyone. Don't waste your money, if it weren't so much of a hassle i'd send them back."
2,Disappointing,"First off I haven't used any other nitrile gloves to compare to so keep that in mind when reading.I completely rebuilt our families bicycles (4 bikes) every piece was cleaned, polished and lubed. I went thru almost a whole box with 3 bikes. I would be working and after a while I noticed a tear somewhere and I hadn't been working with any sharp edges. Once in a while, guessing 1 out of 10 would actually last the way I would expect.Solvent was mineral spirits and I relubed with MagicLube which is rated for incidental contact as a food equipment lube. Nothing strong there. As one tore I just removed it and put another on - was able to keep my hands clean so they did they're job I suppose. At about 13 cents apiece I would expect more.These just seemed to tear way too easily to be considered mechanic grade. I am looking at other brands for replacement."
5,Nicely done,"As I read this book, I kept thinking of Ambrose's great works, David Hackworth's authobiography, and the best works of Turow! I finished it with a much better understanding of Korean War history and its obvious similarities to the Vietnam War. The descriptions of battle were chilling. It truly was hard to put down."
3,Maggie's Mistake,Although I enjoyed this book and I liked Maggie and her personality the one thing I did not like was that this book was a lot like Carolyn Brown's other book Emma's Folly. Emma and Maggie both had to enter in a marriage that was loveless. Maggie was forced to marry Everett because they were in a barn together and Emma because she was running away from her father.I enjoy books that have to do with arranged marriages or forced to get married but these two books pretty much had the same plot.
3,Mostly remakes,"I'd rate this at 3.5 notes - I'm bought this CD for the one song that has never before been available on CD - ""The Good Lord Giveth and Uncle Sam Taketh Away."" Otherwise, this CD duplicates Plantation remakes of classic Decca material that is available on other CDs. Pierce was still an interesting singer at the time these sides were made, but he had lost some of his upper range and his phrasing had changed from his mid-50s Halcyon days."
3,"FOR THE DOGS... Well, almost...","Yes, Lost And Found is a guilty pleasure. David Spade has to be one of the number one lovable losers of all time. His performance in this film is what it is meant to be: a crowd-pleasing gut-buster. But the film itself is anything but ""FINCHY"" (Just Shoot Me). The plot has been over used many times in the past, and the supporting cast were anything but memorable. The closing credits were a big rip-off of There's Something About Mary, but dog'gonit! It was HILARIOUS! Especially because they used the song GROOVE IS IN THE HEART, by Deelight. If not to watch David Spade's very witty, sarcastic sense of humor, rent this movie and fast-forward to the end, 'cause that's the real doggy treat!"
3,Better than I expected,"To tell you the truth, I'm not a David Spade fan...I find him irritating. But I'm a huge Sophie Marceau fan, and she was the only reason I decided to rent this movie (and even then reluctantly so). Well, the movie turned out to be better than I expected. And Spade was almost (operative word there) likable. Unoriginal? Yes; it share's too much in common with Something About Mary. But it was good for a few laughs; even my wife enjoyed it (and she's not normally a big fan of movies of thie genre). And more importantly, I got my fix of the talented and lovely Ms. Marceau for the evening."
3,a glimpse into victorian america,"I discovered this book at my local Sacramento library. I enjoyed the plot and the relaxed pace of the book. The character of the minister is in close parrallel with Reverend Casey in the Grapes of Wrath. Annie kilburn and Grapes of Wrath would be interesting books to read together in a study of how biblical allegory and communist thought are sometimes woven together. Apart from this aspect, i found the book to be a helpful glance back to the lost era of victorian america and the social realities of life during that time. A great read and powerful book in its own right."
1,Not worth the money,I bought this clipper after reading numerous reviews. I have a miniature schnauzer and this clipper did not cut her hair at all. The ironic thing is the clippers my husband used actually worked better and was quieter than this pet friendly version.
1,Don't Buy,I was very disappointed with the clippers. I have a Cairn Terrier and the clippers barely worked the first time I tried to groom him. I watched the video again and read the instructions to make sure I was doing everything properly...apparently the only thing I did wrong was waste my money on the clippers. I tried clipping him again and the clippers didn't cut anything! I waited too long to try them and can't return them. Now I have to spend MORE money taking him to the groomers!
1,no LED lights as stated,"Replacement unit does not have LED lights as described, do not order this item, it does not have the LED lights"
3,OOPS,"I purchased this for my cousin, going away to college, but I had no idea it was for pets. IT still cuts hair so he is using it. Hope he wasn't offended. I'm assuming it's working fine."
5,Amazing,LOVE IT! I would most definitely reccomend this book. A+++. This is definitely one of my favourites from the Kindle Range!
1,uugh!!!,"Very disappointing. It was predictable, tedious and poorly written. Stephenson didn't write this!!Save your time and money. Just not worth reading."
3,Very Hollywood,"Why were Errol Flynn and Claude Rains considered great actors?Errol looks foolish and Claude appears to be dead. The film itself is overlong, inaccurate, and very Hollywood. Eric Portman, a great actor, is completely wasted. Kind of fun if youlike old movies, otherwise don't bother."
4,Canon cartridges come through again,"Buying the designated cartridges for my Canon Printer/scanner/copier is as it should be. They work great, lasting a surprisingly long time for the amount of photos I print. The photo paper was icing on the cake."
3,shipping takes too long,"took way too long to ship, it took almost 4 weeks to arrivebut the product works fine"
1,What a waste..,"Of time and money on this game. It's one of the worst games I have played. Poor graphics and mediocre sound at best is just the beginning. When your character is walking it's as if you are in slow motion. I got a decent way into this game and still only had a wrench as a weapon. Weapons and especially ammo are near impossible to come by in this game. If you want a good fps game, try Daikatana, an excellent game, or Unreal and Halflife, two guaranteed blockbuster games. But skip this game at all costs, don't worry, you didn't miss anything special at all."
1,Rediculous to say the least.,"Most mothers looking to buy cloth diapers for their child are not going to waste their time buying ""5"" diapers at a time. I used cloth diapers on all of my children throughout, and choosing anything less than around 3-4 dozen cloth diapers, per baby, would be something only an inexperienced cloth diapering mother would consider doing.Nevertheless, all (3) of my daughters used cloth diapers on their kids, and not one of them even considered using these cloth diapers in their households. All (3) including my daughter-in-law all used ordinary pin and fold cotton cloth diapers with rubber pants and diaper pins.They had my full support!"
3,Just OK,This really isn't what I thought it would be. I'd say about half of the songs are what I wanted. The other half I skip through. I was disappointed.
2,Didn't recognize some of the songs.,"While much of the music on this double disc offering are fine, there were a few I don't think I had ever heard before. Not always the best renditions of the old memories."
2,Buyer BEWARE!!!!,"On a positive note, there are a lot of really good Christmas songs on the CD's.However, my CD's were not the same as listed here. The cover was the same, but that is where it ends.For example, I had believed I had on my CD a song by Charles Brown, ""Please Be Home For Christmas"", but instead, was replaced by Charles Brown, ""Merry Christmas, Baby"". I thought at first, I had lost my mind, until I checked the listed songs on my CD's against the ones listed here.Besides, many of the songs are listed in a different order! Confusing, heck yeah!!!I would have returned it if had discovered this error before playing it! Oh, well, bought a different CD in order to get that song, even though it is sung by Jon Bon Jovi! LOL!!!"
5,Latest in a series,"This book is the latest in Fred Saberhagen's Berserker series. I haven't had the time to read it yet, but I will eventually."
4,Happy to have it,"I recently decided to re-watch this series and I was ecstatic to find a compilation for 30$ instead of 500. It comes in two cases (with different cover art from item photo). The series comes on 3 discs and the movies are in the second box--I do not know how many discs are in the movie box as I have not yet opened it.The discs do not work in every player. It won't play at all on the Wii, plays perfectly on Xbox360, and my (arguably poor quality) blu ray player can only play some of the episodes (worked fine for 13 episodes and then skipped chunks of the next three, at which point I tried the xbox360).The subtitles are available in Chinese and English only; there is no English audio (which is okay because the translations were horrible if you ever saw them).All in all, it was a great purchase. I am very happy with the product and, for an compact import set, it works well."
4,Fairly Good Introduction,"From my point of view, this book consists of three parts. Part one, that is, Chapters 1-6, devoted to national accounts and their indicators. Part two, that is, Chapters 7-9, devoted to inflation and inflation related labor and production indicators, and finally part three, Chapters 10-11, is devoted to the central bank and treasury systems. The investment analysis part of this book seems to be the market reaction parts mentioned at the end of each section. Yet they seem to me a little too simplistic for the real world. In the real world, we mostly observe growth cycles rather than business cycles. In other words, business cycle recessions rather than growth cycle recessions are depicted in market reaction parts in this book. Nevertheless this is a good streetwise ECON 101 book. As a final note; although not updated, its second edition seems to me better."
2,Sloppy writing and too much repetition,"If you are used to read more technical and professional books, this book will be a disappointment. The writting style is too sloppy. The author has an annoying habit of citing so-on-so said this and that - it's not the standard way of making references in a typical academic manner. There is also too much repetition. The author basically says that whenever an economic indicator suggests a stronger economy, it'd be negative for the bond market and positive for the equity market, which is fine, but she keeps repeating the same thing over and over again. There isn't much insight in it."
4,Missing adapters,"I too was missing the adapters. While they have pointed me to Midland I don't think I should have to be the one to talk to them and solve this. If this hadn't happened before, I would be more understanding, but obviously from the last poster's comments... it has... more than once.This definately puts a ding in my otherwise unblemished dealings with amazon over the last 4 years.Be warned that if you get this set, you may have one more step before they will work."
1,Seriously disappointing,Poor character development and an inferior script combine to make this film a big disappointment. Quite boring. The writer/s have no idea how to build a story. Don't get nostolgic...Jewish characters are presented inaccurately and with distain [except for the Communist lover & other characters who reject their Jewish identity].One of the worst films i've seen in a while.
5,Great Detector for the price.,"This detector is being closed out, and can be had really cheap. For the price it can't be beat. It's an average detector as far as radar detectors go. There are some that are smaller and perform better. There are also much worse. It works well, and the prcie is less than $50 now. What else can you ask for. It also has an electronic compass that works well if you mount it correctly and follow the instructions to calibrate it."
4,Really Good Deal,"I never thought it would work so well. Till now it had informed me everytime there is a radar or a laser. But it really really saved my 2 tickets when I went to Biloxi, MS.Thanks to this cool gadget.But!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! dont take it for granted coz when it detects the laser....its too late then as COPS are damn cautious than we guys are."
5,excellent!,"Love these clippers! Cool and quiet oeration, bought these to replace my oster professional clippers. Am very impressed with the quiet power and love the ceramic blades."
3,My cats are not happy ;),I tried the shortest guard and it didn't work well. I use it without the guard and its ok. The machine gets hot after 15 minutes of use. I have to turn it off several times making the process of beautifying my cats very tiring.
1,Stopped working on the second cut!,From all the reviews I was expecting way more for the price. I used on my English Springer Spaniel for the first cut and it worked great. On the second cut the machine stopped working halfway through the cut! And now Amazon will bot return or exchange as it has been more than 30 days! Nice !
3,smells like bacon.,you get what you pay for. The blade over heads to the point that it can burn your dog. i placed it on my skin one time and stopped wondering why my dogs would shy away in pain from the machine. I was sorry i did not know.
2,great for werewolves too,"Greetings fellow amazonians I bought this because I have to shave the ""werewolf"" from our freak show (he actually isn't a werewolf, but he has some weird disorder that makes hair grow all over his body). Anyhoo I was using this to trim him up for his latest show and was supprised to see that by time I finished his back the hair was back again. We worked and worked at it all day still with no solution. Finally this trimmer gave out after 12 hours of constant use. Please be wary of using this for long periods of time and with people who have genetic disorders"
5,THANK GOD THE 4TH WRONG TURN ISN'T IN THIS,"I love all the Wrong Turn movies, the first 3 were amazing with the ranking as following from best to worst Wrong Turn 2, Wrong Turn 3, Wrong Turn. And I would also like to say the even though I haven't seen the special features on Wrong Turn 2 of any of the Wrong Turn's packaged in this 3 pack (not the Wrong Turn's sold in single DVD form) I've seen the special features on Wrong Turn & Wrong Turn 3, I would have to say THANK GOD THE CREATOR OF THIS 3 PACK DIDN'T INCLUDE WRONG TURN 4. That movie sucks, is wrong on so many levels and is basically a crappy remake a bunch of posers did of the first Wrong Turn. I hope the creators of the Wrong Turn series don't re-release the Wrong Turn series as a 4 pack with the forth installment, that would be a disgrace to the Wrong Turn movies just like the forth one was."
1,Cant say horrible...that title is already taken.,"This book is absolutely painful to read. If you have to purchase this book for class, be prepared for chapter 7, 10, & 11. These are the most painful chapters in the book. In these chapters it is very hard to follow the text (i.e. main points). Other students and I got migranes from trying to prepare notes for these chapters for a test. Just horrible."
2,Very broad ... but very biased!,Good book for an introduction to International Relations couse in terms of topics covered - but the author's bias is clearly leaning toward that of an idealist/globalist. Make sure you get a balanced perspective from the other side of the coin before taking this text as gospel.
4,Not Good for Unibody Macs,"I bought this to upgrade my late 2008 aluminum Unibody Macbook. It did not seem to fit. I'm not downgrading it since I don't doubt it would work, however I would like to warn people that this does NOT work with late-2008 unibody macs."
4,"No complaints, works as described","I've used the memory for a month now, and so far so good. To add to what the other reviewer has stated, if you use a 32-bit Windows, you will not see 4GB of Ram. Windows will only recognize 3GB +. To solve this problem, you'll need to install a 64-bit Windows."
3,Not Mac compatible?,"This memory is not 667Mhz. The chips used are actually faster and do not down clock properly in some Macs. Would not POST in either my MacBook Early 2008 nor my iMac Mid 2007. Otherwise, I believe this memory should be fine for most 667 spec'd machines. Generally I have had good luck with PNY."
1,Toshiba A135-S4666 Doesn't work,"It doesn't work for Toshiba A135-S4666... In Description it says its work for 533 MHZ DDr2...But it definitely does not work for this laptop. Return...though I luv Amazon, Fast delivery and hassle free customer service."
1,Buyer beware! Did not work for MacBook memory upgrade!,"Did not work for a late 2007 MacBook.One chip worked, but both didn't work together.Pretty useless because we need both to work to take advantage of best data transfer rates."
1,Does not work,"I have a Toshiba Satellite A215 laptop. Toshiba's site says my laptop supports upto 4 GB of DDR2 667 MHz memory. However, when I insert the DIMMs into the laptop, it powers up but does not go any further (i.e. blank screen). This is possibly due to the same reason that others have mentioned, i.e. PNY labels PC2 800 MHz DIMMs as 667 MHz and finicky laptops do not accept this. This may be a great product (or not) but since it doesn't work for me, I'm forced to rate it 1 star (0 stars if that were an option).RMA'd product and am now awaiting the Mushkin Enhanced essentials memory that is compatible with my laptop per the Mushkin memory configurator (excellent tool). Could not find a half-decent memory configurator on the PNY site, unfortunately, else it may have saved me some aggravation. Amazon was awesome with the return process, so no complaints about that.Hopefully the make and model of the laptop helps someone else with their decision about whether to purchase this product."
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MACBOOKS,"Previous reviewers are correct: this product will not work in pairs in PC2-5300 compatible MacBooks. The SO-DIMMS will work one-at-a-time with a factory stick, but not alone. The product is incorrectly labeled."
1,NOT GOOD FOR EARLY MACBOOKS,Wish I had read the reviews by users who tried to install this in early Macbooks before I purchased it. Using the two sticks together simply does not work. This product is apparently PC6400 ram sold in PC5300 packaging. Lame...
5,Happy,"I changed out my 2GB RAM for 4GB RAM for my Compaq CQ-50 which runs great. Installation was easy and once the laptop was running, the speed came back. A cheap fast way to up grade speed."
2,Did not work with my iMac,"The ram seemed to be running fine but when i had one or more programs running and was watching an online video my computer would completely freeze or go blank. Installed my original ram and recreated the same scenario without the computer crashing. Returned the ram and Amazon was great about refunding my order, thanks Amazon."
1,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"BEWARE of this company's customer service. They are horrible to work with if you get DOA memory, which happened to me on 2 PNY sticks. They make cheap products, then put you through hell to return them.You have to fill out the form on their website with WAY too many questions, then you must wait for a response. Then they simply email you back and say to call a phone number (1-800-234-4597) and start the process over again. Their phone system is AWFUL and puts you through loops, then it hung up on me TWICE. Their customer service people on the phone are rude, and unwilling to help. I told them I would be writing a review on Amazon, and they didn't care. Also, cross-ship return is not available unless you pay a non-refundable $30 fee, in addition to a hold on your credit card.A word to the wise: BUY ANOTHER BRAND. It's not worth the headache."
1,DO NOT BUY,"These modules are actually 800Mhz. PNY no longer makes or sells 667Mhz modules. Not all computers that require 667Mhz are compatible with 2 800Mhz modules. They refuse to down clock properly. This is especially true with a number of Core 2 Duo MacBooks. Spoke to PNY support, they flat out told me that yes, they sell 800Mhz modules in 667Mhz packaging. If you RMA a module that is 667Mhz (or supposed to be 667Mhz) they will replace it with an 800Mhz module as they no longer have any 667Mhz SODIMMs, not even for RMA replacement!Horrible marketing department. Horrible RMA strategy.Never buying another PNY product again!But, at least their lead tech support person was honest. What I wrote above came directly from him!They want me to return it to Amazon and make it Amazon's problem that PNY is selling them (and then on to consumers) mislabeled products!!!!!!!!"
2,"Misty, Hot. Chelsea, Not!","This movie was terrible. Misty & Chelsea don't really do anything at all. Let's face it, the only reason any guy buys or rents any of Misty Mundae's movies is just to see her running around in the nude actin silly. I like her body cause it's natural, like the long hair & the way she acts but thats it. If you're not a fan of Misty Mundae, don't waste your time."
5,great sounds,I was very please with te sound quality of this porduct for the price I got it for I have since turned four of my family and friends onto Amazon for there shopping needs. Thanks Amazon for such awesome products and even better pricing!!!
3,Disappointing,"I thought this book would be about the process of getting an extensive physical and how this changes your thoughts and actions upon receiving this kind of information, i.e. your own mortality. The first third is about getting that physical and this part of the book is good. Unfortunately after that, the book is just random essays on topics marginally related. The history of tobacco, his hate towards G.W. Bush and what the President has done to stem-cell research, the pros and cons of the author getting a vasectomy. Plus his writing style is unnecessarily crass. Turning his treadmill stress test into his dominatrix fantasy was just childish."
4,It Cleans,I bought this cleaner because I did not want to continue renting a rug cleaner and because I cannot afford to hire someone to clean my carpet and furniture as often as needed (once per year). The hoover did a very nice job cleaning my carpet. The carpet dried quickly which was very convenient. I look forward in using the furniture accessories because that is where I anticipate the greatest savings. I am very glad that I bought this cleaner.
2,S&H cost more than the product itself,Bought this product as a combo with the Hoover SteamVac then found out that the S&H for the detergent alone is $16.90 while the SteamVac ships FREE. I could have bought this at local Wal-Mart for $15.45 plus tax.
5,Love the series!,My husband was so very saddened when this show was taken off the air. I bought him this series for Christmas and I think he watched it everynight for weeks!Perfect item for any fan!
2,Pretty lousy packaging.,"There series itself is great. But be warned, the packaging on this gift set isvery bad. The disks I received had moved around in the package during shipping,and several were scratched. They were fortunately still viewable, but when I buy anew dvd, I expect the surface to be perfect."
5,Great series,Bought this for my boyfriend as a gift. One of his favorite series - he loved the fact he got the complete series all in one.
2,Better information on BMW forums,"I've been repairing, maintaining and modifying cars for over 30yrs and always had a shop manual for the particular car I was working on. The Bentley Manual is fine for most of its photos (however, some pics are not accurate) and the instruction is OK if the reader has experience working on cars. I was able to do more work on my car by just observing the placement of part or system and by referring to several BMW forums which, in my opinion, are far and above this simple manual. It can come in handy as a quick reference but does not serve as an end all shop manual."
3,In the country of the blind - the one-eyed man is king !,"Bentley is the only game in town for BMW owners - there is no alternative. Nearest dealer is thirty miles away. You have to fix it yourself. It leaves a lot to be desired. It is a far cry from any GM Factory Service Manual in depth, and doesn't give the rationale for the design, or how the part functions. Too many photographs and not enough drawings. The drawings don't identify parts well-enough. There is too much white-space in the layout, making it cumbersome. It should be model specific for a particular power plant, and it should be put out with separate editions for each model year."
4,Sylvania Xtra Vision Headlights,"They are just what they say they are, ""Xtra Vision""...they're not the brightest, as it turns out, but for the price, they are definitely better than what I had."
5,A very good book!,"This was a very good book. We are reading it in eighth grade, even though it is a 1st grade reading level. it is the best book!"
1,Scary and Depressing,"I was thrilled to be pregnant and, having seen this book more than once, expected it to be helpful. While it can offer some useful information to those who do not have knowledge about their MS at this point, the rest, with comments added in by mothers, was just scary and depressing. One women even comments that if she had known how bad she was going to feel she would never have gotten pregnant! This is NOT a book for someone who is happy about their pregnancy and unwilling to let MS rule their lives. Women would be better off reading one of the other books on MS combined with a good pregnancy book. This book also chooses to follow alternative medicine, which can be disappointing for those of us looking for traditional medical advice. I would suggest pregnant women with MS find a good website for women with multiple sclerosis. There a person can get advice from the message boards and chats, places where people not only share information, but a general concern for ones feelings."
1,Piece of crap,"A piece of crap. Unless you are an electrical engineer, let this go. A total waste of time and money."
2,Doesn't live up to it's label.,"Does not last anywhere close to 24 hours, or even 8 hours. I like the smell, but wish it lasted longer.I bought it on sale at the local grocery store. Very inexpensive and I know Brut isn't a premium brand, but I expected a better product, similar to Old Spice.Will stick with Old Spice in the future."
1,tacky at best,"My husband and I have never been into anything like this before and were interested in checking it out. We looked around and saw this. The cover was a little shady, and the description seemed a little interesting but once we watched it we were very disapointed. The acting was cheesy at best. It was like an adult Hocus Pocus with Bette Middler. They were trying to kill people to stay young like that movie where they suck the life out of children to stay young. Totally not worth the three bucks I spent on it. I'll keep looking for something of interest. Bad acting... just aweful. Save your money."
5,a MUST have for anyone that wants to program in C#,"It is simple, really simple... if you want to program in C# you must get this book, it is an invaluable tool that I have thoroughly worn out. I have read this book at least 10 times. It gives you all the basics, and can be used for years as a reference and/or cheat sheet. I have a few C# books, and all of them are great, but this one is the one I'd pick if I could only have 1Very well written, easy to understand, it can teach even the computer illiterate to understand programming"
4,Chillingly good,"A stylish, atmospheric ghost story which, unlike so many recent examples of the genre, does not rely on any climactic twist for its punch. The chills and thrills are happily much more old-fashioned here, and quite a bit more bloodthirsty. The performances are universally excellent, and the music, cinematography, direction and visual effects are all first rate (the ghostly rendering of Santi - the ""one who sighs"" - is exceptionally good). Writer/director Guillermo Del Toro's screenplay is in an entirely different league to his 'Cronos' and 'Mimic'. Sure, it has a similar level of tension and fascination, but there's a much stronger thematic vein at work here. Viewers familiar with the history and politics of the Spanish Civil War will find it particularly rewarding, appreciating the story on a deeper metaphorical level. Others will just admire and enjoy this film for what it superficially is: a slick, good-looking and remarkably unsettling piece."
4,A Story Within A Story--And I Don't Know Which One Is Scarier,"Like The Orphanage and Pan's Labyrinth, Guillermo del Toro's 2001 The Devil's Backbone is ""thinking person's horror."" Set in the immediate aftermath of the Spanish Civil War and taking place almost entirely within a creepy orphanage which has the singular feature of an unexploded bomb in its courtyard, this atmospheric tale of sadism, kindness, and postmortem revenge works very well on many levels. As was the case two years ago with Pan's Labyrinth I found myself every bit as interested in the real world goings on in this film as I was in the plot of the haunting of the orphanage by the spirit of a murdered, missing boy, and this duality of storytelling marks del Toro as every bit as talented a writer as he is creator of eerie movies. Not a lot of flash and special effects here, just a good old fashioned spooky ghost story."
3,Not so scary ghost story,"With out getting into all the art school hype and lingo that overwhelms the rest of these reviews,lets just say Det Torro did the best he could with an ""ok"" script. Nice to watch once but lets be truthful here...it's no Pan's Labyrinth by any means and the ghosts' make up is too amateur! Still watch it once to say you did."
4,Well done . . .,"I enjoyed this movie very much, and I am quite critical about movies generally. The story makes sense, the ghost sequences are believable and realistic in special effects, and the acting is excellent. Anytime you have children involved significantly in a movie, you don't know what you are going to get, but they work fine in this film . . . My only criticism is that the film is about 10 minutes too long."
5,Magical Realism that the Europeans Do So Well,"This is a beautiful film that I discovered through recommendations here. It lived up to those accolades. Only the Europeans seem capable of telling ghost stories on one level yet also combining dramatic elements from the tangible world on other levels within the same film. Here the Spanish Civil War is underway and this one orphanage acts as the focal point for the violence and brutality at large in Spain at the time. Eduardo Noriega (II) is as good here as he was in ""Open Your Eyes."" He is the villain of the piece from the first moment you see him but he is a deeply layered villain and Noriega presents his full complexity beautifully. The children are wonderful in the story and the episodes with the ghost child will have you on the edge of your seat. This is no American mad slasher film though. It is a fully realized beautifully told tale of righting wrongs in a world gone mad."
2,missed opportunity,"A film set around a few spooky moments, but in the end unchallenging in its script or situation. The opening monologue that questions the nature of ghosts seems more of a trick to sound philiosphical than to really delve into the nature of ghosts--the Dedvil's Backbone holds a lot of promise in its preview, but carries very little of it out in its execution. A more daring script would have brought a lot more to the whole ball of wax."
5,entertaining and educational,"you can select various sound tracks for the loop of bird videos - you can leave off labels, but if you want to know the name of the bird you're watching you can select to leave on the subtitles.very relaxing dvd"
2,the rowng one,It would have been fine but they sent me the wrong one after they had me fil out all the stufe
1,Defective right out of package,Did not work at all. Light did not even come on. Did not charge batteries. Terrible product.
1,HORRIBLE!!!!,The battery life is horrible! I bought these batteries to use with my xbox controller. I charged them for over a week before using them. I played the xbox maybe an hour and all of a sudden the controller died and it keeps doing it!!! I don't think I'll ever buy another energizer product.
3,"It's good enough, but ...","... it's not bluegrass. Rather, it has more of an avant garde jazz or classical fee to it (think The String Quarter series). Perhaps it's just an inevitable side effect of the source material, but these come across much more like instrumental interpretations of Radiohead than anything else. In most numbers an acoustic guitar is accompanied by drums (and they call this bluegrass!) with a few banjo and fiddle solos for that ""bonafide feel.""If you like Tommy Emmanuel or think Nickel Creek's ""Why Should the Fire Die?"" is their best album, then this disc is for you. Get Eliza Lumley's ""She Talks in Maths: Interpretations Of Radiohead"" while you're at it. If, on the other hand, you like Radiohead or actual bluegrass, then look elsewhere."
3,It is just ok.,This book is just ok for the java programmer without security experice. It explains the security concept very clear. But there are lots of typing errors. and the support are terrible. The source code online are incomplete. The book website is down.
4,Good frame at great price; tight fit though if you use a mat,"This frame is very light weight and a quality product in the context of its very low price. I bought 8 of these that I used to frame 8x10 photos and hung in a cluster. I have four others of the same model and make from an earlier in-store purchase. The frame helps articulate the picture as by itself it is so minimalistic. I do have to warn that if you use framing mats as I did, the fit tends to be a bit tight with respect to the depth and getting the glass face mounted back onto the frame. In that sense, I can see that some of the thicker mats can make this frame not usable - I used thinner ones that just fit."
1,a real disappointment,These frames are extremely fragile. Half of them were broken when they arrived. Most them developed cracks later on. Also I replaced the cardboard inside them with new matte boards but they barely fit. I bought lots of them too. I'm really sad.
4,Sweet!,"Love the adorable fairies in this book. Lovely drawings, appropriate for myself and my young daughter."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!,"I ordered this item as a ""COLLECTIBLE"". UNUSED, NEW, NEVER TAKEN OUT OF ORIGINAL PACKAGING!!!! NOT EVEN CLOSE!!! The seller sent the item in the CHEAPEST WRAPPING they could find. Not even a BOX!!! When it arrived it was bent, dented, and smashed. What a waste of $$$$. I had to go & find another one on E BAY, where they Guarantee their sellers to be TRUE."
2,Sounds okay...but it's design needs work,"While the sound quality coming out of the devise is okay...the devise its self (...).First, The battery cover on the back, is only held shut by a little plastic tab, easily broken with moderate use.Second, There is no USB support for this product. The only way to transfer music is via a slow serial connection.Third, While it takes only two batteries, it ought to take more. This thing is a major battery drainer, I can only get 3-4 hours of one charge.Fourth, No backlight LCD screen. Makes it somewhat hard to see what song is selected in the dark.Fifth, Only 32mb of space on the player, and while you can get more space with smartmedia cards, a 64mb smart media card costs almost as much as the mp3 player its self.I would not recommend this player to anyone, unless you are sort of pressed on money. But there are other mp3 players under 200 dollars that are a lot better quality and have more features."
4,good not great,"It's the only machine design book I've owned, so i have no comparison, but it fit well into the course I was taking with it. Everything is well illustrated, and clearly explained."
4,No CD ROM and Nowhere to be Found on Net,"Book is worth the price. However, there in NO CD ROM included with the book, and the directions given at the front of the book regarding where to download the software is incorrect. Neither the author's nor the publisher's websites offer the software for anyone except professors adopting the book.I am tempted to return the book just for that shabby attention to details."
5,Great toy!,I bought this toy for my nephew three years ago and it has been handed down to 3 kids since then and it is still good as new. All 4 kids who have used this toy LOVED it!
1,Too loud!,Grandma got this for our daughter when she was 14 months old. She enjoys climbing onto the seat and pushing buttons/turning the steering wheel. But we have to leave the noises OFF because there is no volume control and it is very loud. The voice and songs are very annoying and somewhat difficult to understand. It also is not a good riding toy as it is too wide for my daughter (now 21 months) to effectively push her feet against the floor.
5,"Great book, not your ordinary bubble gum romance!","I bought this book because of its low price and though ""what the heck"" from reading the description. I anticipated this to be just another fluff romance book, and was totally wrong. This book is written with humor, woes, family and love all tangled within the story; and written in a way you get caught up in the characters woes and have you rooting for them. In addition, the author gives the readers just enough information of a particular background story to make you anticipate knowing the full story. I found this to be a great read and a pleasant surprise!! Only suggestion - fire the company that marketed this book!!"
5,***** DON'T MISS THIS BOOK!!!!,"For starters, I still don't like contemporary romances. Especially, when they're set in places I've never been, and with characters that have difficult pasts. Add to this, an ex-FBI agent, a divorcee, a troubled teen, and the matriarch of the household with the heart of gold named Flo. I thought I was in for yet another ""Lifetime-Special-Movie-of-the-Week"" kind of plot.Was I ever surprised! Irene Peterson's debut GLORY DAYS transcends every stereotype I've ever had of this genre. This woman had me by page 3, and never let me go. I can smell the Jersey Shore now, I can see the boardwalk, I can taste the soup the S.R.O. is serving, and I about died laughing when the duct-tape mystery was solved! That's how good Irene Peterson is.This book is never leaving my possession. Truly. I only wish it had never ended."
4,Too short,"A good compilation, but a better one would have been 2 CDs long (at least). Another flaw is the accompanying notes, in which the solo singers and instrumentalists for each track are not identified."
3,I love my scooter,I know it sounds corny but I wouldn't have much of a life without my scooter. I don't own this exact model - mine is an earlier model that look almost just like this one and it has held up remarkably well.
4,Guide to understanding natural horsemanship,"This was a well written, easy to understand book on understanding what natural horsemanship is about. It explained many of the concepts and terms used by the various clinicians, as well as describing what this means in terms of practical application when working with a horse. After reading books by many of these natural horsemanship trainers - Parelli, Rashid, Anderson, etc. - this book helped in being able to compare and contrast the various styles. Natural Horsemanship Explained is a book that anyone interested in natural horsemanship should want in their library as an overall reference for learning and applying natural horsemanship techniques."
3,Natural Horeseman explained,If I had picked it up and skimmed through it at the store I would not have bought it. It is not that informing
1,Cheaply made,I bought this because I was looking for something cheap and I guess I got what I paid for it. The back is like a puzzle that I am apparently not intelligent enough to figure out. I ended up throwing it away.
2,Does NOT Work on Cat Hair,"May work on Dogs but definately not meant for Cat hair. Tried on my medium haired cat and kept jamming up on me, would not cut even. My cat looks like he has some disease now and is going to need to go to the groomers I did such a bad job. I attempted to use just the blade without the attachments and that would not even work on the hair. Big disappointment- I guess I get what I pay for."
1,"Very Disappointed! Old Product, no support!","I got this webcam because I wanted an inexpensive webcam. The driver that came with the webcam does not work. I tried downloading the driver from D-Link's site. The driver still doesn't work. I tried calling D-Link, and the 800 number is not in service for that product. If I don't get this thing working by tomorrow I'm returning it(...) It's frustrating to have a product not work out of the box. I'm installing this on Windows98 Second Edition. It's via USB, so no power cord necessary."
5,A Commentary for Everyone,"Dr. McGee is a great teacher of the word. His radio show is excellent and these brief commentaries are a great synopsis of his daily teachings on the air. Dr. McGee died in 1989 but his insight into the scriptures live on.This particular commentary on the great book of 1 Peter is very well written. Dr. McGee's teachings on suffering that go with chapter 3 of 1 Peter are very well said. Dr. McGee helps enlighten us to the fact that all men will suffer, and knowing Christ does not necessarily end suffering. But knowing Christ surely does help us to put our troubles and suffering in perspective. When we know Christ we have hope and joy in the midst of whatever comes our way.Dr. McGee knew this and his teachings from this wonderful commentary are deep and meaningful for all of us. I highly reccommend his book."
3,for what it's worth...,"Used the whole container, but couldn't discern any visible change. Cream goes on easily, feels nice, and smells good...but I wouldn't buy it again."
5,GREAT PRODUCT with NOTICEABLE EFFECTS,After I had been using the product a few weeks my 25-year old son mentioned that my face was looking great! Thank you Olay Total Effects Night Firming Cream!
4,Not Half Bad For A Wrestler,This is suprisingly not bad at all with the exception of bad bad man. But all and all this is actually a pretty good cd for a wrestler rapper. he actually has some talent. Hes no pac or a biggie or even a Jadakiss but its worth the money.
4,pretty good for a first attempt,"I was expecting this to be pretty lame, but it's not. There are some good beats, and Cena's flow is surprisingly good but at times the beats can sound a bit amatuerish, and the Trademarc has the worst flow Ive ever heard (worse than vanilla ice). Overall though, Cena rhymes well to a variety of beats, personal favourites are Flow Easy, just another day, keep frontin (great),running game, beatdown, if it asll ended tomorrow. As you can see there are alot of good tracks, as I said this could be a classic with slightly better beats with some of the tracks, a bit less ""im the baddest"" you see in 99 out of 100 rappers, and losing The Trademarc (replace with better guest appearances)"
4,not bad,"first time around, this album reminded me most of House of Pain. you can't see me is very old school and unfortunately somewhat forgetable except for a couple of exceptions. the tracks such as his theme song ""the time is now"" and ""bad bad man"" were a couple of those. i was happy to see that he didn't hold back on the dirty language for all the kids like i have seen them do with a few of the wwe cds. that just kind of makes it cheesy when they do that.overall, if you like old school rap (late 80's, early 90's) you will enjoy this. if not, then stay away."
1,I've seen better,"First of all, I am a fan of hip hop/rap. I purchased this cd for my neice because she is a wrestling fan, and I knew that she wanted it. That was a mistake because the edited version is definitely not edited. I heard the F word in this cd more than I had heard in awhile.The cd is average, if not slightly below, and could use some production help from Dr. Dre or Eminem. IF you wish to become controversial, then seek help from the master.All in all, I would not recommend this for purchase unless you are an adult. I buy clean stuff for my kids, and this is definitely not a good buy."
3,Good,This was a good album. John Cena did his thang. Trademarc really shined on this album. I knew he had skillz but he really impressed me on this album. John impressed me as well. He can really free style. He showed me that on 106 & Park yesterday. They both have made skillz. Bumpy Knuckles really laid down some tracks... that boy is off the chain.
4,TRIMMER,1. DOES GOOD JOB FOR WEEDS & SOME BRUSH.2. REPACEMENT LINE DID NOT GET TWISTED.3. UNIT IS A LITTLE ON THE HEAVY SIDE.4. EASY TO TAKE SPOOL OUT WHEN EMPTY.
3,A real tribute?,"I don't know of a real tribute that doesnt include the best songs, as in this case My Girlfriend wasnt included and everyone who knows Relient K knows this song."
3,Good Title,There were too many characters in the story for the book to be interesting to me. I love this author but this was not one of her best books!
5,Excellent value,"I've had an HL-2070N on my home network for several months and I have been very pleased. It is connected to a Netgear 8 port 10/100 switch. I've experienced no difficulties getting a couple of PCs running Windows XP Pro, two Apple G4 iBooks, and one Apple MacBook Pro to print to it.The print quality is excellent. I have not had the problem with paper curling like some other reviewers have reported.I installed one for a client who needed to print from Macs and PCs on his home network. It's working well for him there. I have another client who bought one themselves and use it a lot, who informed me that it's working well.I highly recommend the HL-2070N, especially if you need to print from non-Windows computers."
1,Oportet vos: beware !,"Being used on a Mac. Not a smooth operating printer; loud [who cares as long as it prints], must use exactly the right paper or it clogs up and then you have the devil to pay. Tip over the machine, engage in a treasure search for the offending paper to find where it stuck, yank it out, reboot and watch the red light, and watch and wait. Highly sensitive and unforgiving; have not even tried to network it. What is the right weight of paper is anyone's guess. Heavier, better."
3,Wouldn't install into my network,"The install instructions were no help, so I'm left with a network(able) printer running on a USB line to ONE computer. The manual kept referring me to my Network Administrator for assistance. Yeah right, it's in my house and I'm the only one here. Other than that, it prints quietly, quickly and cleanly. And turns itself on/off soon enough (not described in manual, surprising enough). Like the prints, hate the networking documentation."
5,"Great, low cost printer","I installed this printer in 10 minutes. It works perfectly, dead silient when sleeping, wakes up in 2 seconds and prints very fast and perfect. An amazing deal, a great printer."
3,Replacement parts too expensive!,"A few days after my 1 year warrantee expired, the tray which holds the powdered ink malfunctioned. A new tray cost $114.00 plus shipping. That is more than 50% of what I paid for the printer.Otherwise very satisfied. I have 2 and one has not broken in a year."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"The Brother HL-2070N seems like a no-brainer buy: It's cheap, it's network-ready, its low-profile and charcoal color looks classy in a front-office environment, and it has a manual feed slot primarily for use with envelopes. So what's not to like?The paper coming out curled or curved is annoying, but it's true also that it's not THAT bad, and I've found that putting the sheets face-down while they cool helps flatten them back out.The other BAD thing is, when I print on our pre-printed envelopes that have a heavier stock with a slightly rougher than normal surface, it leaves a ghost image of the address about an inch to the left of the actual address. This is VERY annoying, since I print a lot of envelopes, and it doesn't look very professional. In fact, I may have to figure out a way to dump this printer and order a new one."
4,For the $$$ this is a great laser printer,"Setup was quite easy, but the installation instructions were a bit hazy, when it came to networking this printer via ethernet. But when all was done this printer works well with networking and directly connected. The only problem is, I have to turn off my ceiling fan when printing many pages, due the fact the pages fly out of it so rapidly they sometimes fly right out due to the fan. Funny thing is, I also bought a HP 7310 all-in-one inkjet that boasts 30 pages/minute, what a lie, it doesn't even come close to the 2070N even in draft mode."
5,Great for the price,I have had this Brother HL-350 laser printer for a few years now for a small business and it works great. Has a smaller footprint than other brands and installs easily. I have very slight paper curl that flattens itself out and no heat issues as mentioned in another review (maybe they were printing a lot of envelopes at once). Also the correct toner replacement cartridge for the HL-2070N Network printer is TN-350. Can buy through Amazon or OfficeMax stores. The only issue I had was the paper feed uptake wasn't working. I discovered a solution online to just loosen the paper clamp at the back of the tray so there is a little space at the front side of the tray and the issue was solved. I had the paper stack jammed too tightly.
1,WOULDNT BUY AGAIN,"My printer is only 7 months old and gets moderate use. I paid $89.99 for it and it now needs a new drum which costs $116.00. It consistently calls for paper, however paper is in the tray.I would not recommend this product or buy a Brother again."
4,"Solid printer, curly pages","Compared to many inkjets I have used, this printer not only prints quickly, it starts printing the pages out within 10 seconds. The only beef I have with it is the pages come out with a healthy curl, almost as though each one gets rolled up first. This is a little annoying, but the printer is otherwise a great machine."
5,Pleasantly suprised!,"This was my first laser printer under $1500, my first new one in 7 years. Very impressed with it's simplicity and the quality of the printing. At this price; for a printer used for a couple hundred pages a month, it's a winner.I've printed in excess of 5000 pages, no problems, good quality."
1,Decent printer but Amazon is a deaf company,"Printer OK. Do NOT order the TN 460 cartridge STILL listed as an accessory above. It does NOT fit the machine and then you will hassle with Amazon and they will charge you a return fee AND return shipping. I have repeatedly talked with Amazon. My final e-mail to Amazon follows:I did not ""accidentally order the wrong item."" Your site STILL lists TN460 cartridge as a recommended accessory for the Brother 2070N laseer printer but it does NOT work! All I did was follow your suggestion. This is idiotic to penalize me for your mistake that is STILL on the site. How many other good customers have you ticked off with this dumb mistake?StevePS I love Amazon. Look at how much money I have spent with you over the last year or two. But I simply don't have time to bicker with you over fifteen bucks. Sad to have a bad taste in my mouth. Up till now our long relationship has been great."
4,Quality Printer,"It is an excellent idea to have all the computers in your house share one printer. Installation was very easy, just plugged it into one of the wired ports on the wireless router and had all the PCs in the house printing to it. It is a very good quality for the price!"
5,Can't beat it,You can't beat this printer. The price was just right. Setup was a breeze on both a PC and a MAC. Print quality is good. Print speed is good. The paper curling issue that others have mentioned isn't really an issue at all.I really can't say much more...the other reviews do a great job.
1,BE WARNED,"A nice idea yes! In action NO be warned I wouldn't be surprised if this thing flops as badly as the Iomega Hipo Zip which also used PocketZip disks, mechanical malfunctions are a given, steer clear of these and get a solid state or CD mp3 playerI have warned you, it will work for a few months fine then it will all go down hill fromn there."
4,Conflicts abound for protagonist as well as Venezuela,"Iron ore mining must be halted when an archeologist discovers a prehistoric bone flute. Semi-retired CEO Sam Warrender in his characteristic high handed manner, flies to Venezuela to bully, bribe, or bamboozle the resumption of his company's operation. But he must contend with an archeologist fervently protecting pre-history, his own hand-picked successor jealous to assume power from Sam, a communist guerilla who sees an opportunity to resume anarchy, and a beguiling film-maker who Sam has watched grow from a pre-teen into a woman to be reckoned with.The story is at its best in revealing Venezuela: its jungle beauty (a plane flight over the Angel Falls), its turbulent economy, its shaky politics, its people. It is at its worst propping up a May-December romance between Sam and the film-maker. The narrative is strong, unpredictable, and handles plenty of action clearly. Overall, a very good read except a point taken away for the romance."
1,Card did not start,As soon as I received the product I installed it and the card did not start. I tried all the slots available and the card did not start. I moved the fax modem to another slot and placed the card in this slot and the card started the first time and the second time it did not start. As result I am returning it.
2,Could Be Better,"I own the papasan swing so I went out and bought the seat thinking it would be equally good. I call the swing my baby sitter, it is fantastic. The seat is really cozy and my son loves the mirror. My main complaints are that the music and vibration turn off and it is too short. My son is not that tall and his little feet hit the bar at the bottom. The aquatic seat is longer and will run continuously. That said, I still use the seat I just won't be able to use it for as long as I would have liked."
2,Comfy and cozy but not for the fussy baby,"While this seat looks and feels incredibly comfortable, and plays a soothing little lullaby, my son doesn't like it. He's kind of a restless baby in general, and the vibration alone just doesn't cut it - he prefers a bouncy seat or swing with bigger motions."
3,"Great for NEWBORNS, not for older infants.","This seat is really not a great buy. I bought this seat, being attracted to the plushness and comfort of the seat. I had not thought further to when my baby would need visual stimulation....at TWO MONTHS. My son will not sit in this seat because he is truly bored with it. I highly recommend the Fisher Price Aquarium Bouncer for the baby needing more than just a pillow to sit on. I wasted my money on this being able to use if for just one month."
3,"Okay, but I am sure there are better!","I bought this item for my baby before he was born because it looked comfy and was soft. He is now 5 weeks old. He likes the seat fine, but after a few minutes, the vibration and music stop. That is great if you happen to leave it on, but for a baby that is just about to fall asleep, that is not good. When it stops, he starts crying. The blanket that is with it just gets in the way also. This seat is okay, but I am sure that there are better seats for the money! I am not too impressed.UPDATE: My son is now 9 weeks old and we don't even bother to get this out anymore. It cannot keep him entertained. The vibration is so soft that it doesn't do anything. I am sure that there are definitely better deals out there. On the other hand, the papasan swing is GREAT!"
3,Kind of boring,"I bought this seat after reading the great reviews from other moms. My son was pretty bored with this. Maybe he just likes to be overstimulated but with only have a mirror and a hanging bunny, he wasn't to keen on the seat. I had to start putting some of his other toys on the bar hooked on by the ring-a-links to give him something else to play with. The vibration was ok I guess, but he didn't really like it. The music was kind of boring, only 1 tune, unlike the papasan swing which had multiple options for sounds. He outgrew the chair fairly quickly and we were kind of glad. It did work good to place him in it while I showered but he was pretty fussy when I was done. The one thing this seat didn't do was bounce. Wish I would have thought about that before I bought it."
3,"Looks Comfy, Babies disagrees!","We decided on this seat because it looked the most comfortable for our daughter and we liked the simple design of it. I find that my daughter does not like it, and the only way we can get her to not cry when she's in it, is to put her in it asleep. She likes the chairs that bouce, but this one just vibrates and she does not like the vibration at all. At 2 months old she's already to long for it, her legs hang way off (and no she is not long for her age). We do have the papsan swing and she loves that!"
2,Papasan Infant Seat (Original model),"I fell in love with how comfy this seat looked, registered for it and got it at my shower. My daughter hated it. She had to be asleep before even being put in it. There is no motion other than the vibration so after about 1 month old she didn't want to be in it! We have the Papasan swing which is the best gift we received! It plays music that is beautiful and has a mirror with birds that spin around it, she will lay in the swing and stare and then fall asleep when tired. The papasan seat doesn't do enough! I would recommend getting a bouncer that actually bounces and has something to look at!"
4,Thanks seller and Amazon,"The book I bought it at ten years ago, this was the first time I use Amazon. Thanks"
1,HP Laserjet1200 and Linksys printserver,"Despite spending hours (days) attempting to configure the printserver, I was unsuccesful. The printserver does not appear to be compatible with the HP laserjet 1200. I wish I had read the reviews prior to purchase. Problem is incompatability with HP drivers. Tried all drivers, tried all settings. Would be interested to hear from the people who apparently got this to work."
2,Okay with some printers,I have both an HP 842C deskjet and a HP laserJet 1200The 842C works great but the HP 1200 Laser will not work. Tech support not that great for a non-working printer.So now I am stuck with needing a directjet interface for the laser.
3,Serves the purpose.,"It's certainly not perfect, but for under $20 delivered, it give you an opportunity to practice during the winter."
4,Intense.,"This is an intense tale of a woman plunged into despair by her husband's announcement he is leaving her, and her eventual recovery. It is a tribute to Ferrante, that except for the long day the woman becomes what I would identify as clinically depressed, I found the book entertaining. It is certainly a book one remembers. Ferrante accomplishes this in two ways: Ferrante's language often delights; the woman, despite not being all that nice, is likable, honest, and has great powers of self analysis. As an example of Ferrante's language, ""I stretched a taut wire that pierced the days and I slid softly along it"". Readers who enjoyed this book might like Anita Brookner's ""Leaving Home"" (different topic but much in common). One little thing bothered me: if her husband knew for some time that he might leave her, why did he encourage her to quit the job she had gotten in Turin? After all, he is a calculating guy."
4,Anthony should let someone else direct.,"If you have never seen the Wiggles before, this is a great show. Nice songs, cool acrobatics, fun.If you have seen a lot of them, skip this. Murray looks tired. Sam seems to have squabbled with Anthony backstage and keeps as far away as he can. And, worse, Anthony takes every opportunity to do a split or handstand, even when there's really no call for it in the music. It's OK, we get it, you are in good shape even though you are in your late 40s.It's a good show, though, just not my favorite.Sam's voice is amazing. And Jeff seems to have blossomed since Greg's departure. His singing is better than ever and he appears relaxed and happy performing."
3,"Good, but rather simple.","Good ideas, well organized, but a bit simple. If you want to start something more complex than a simple ""mom & pop feel"" type business you need go elsewhere."
3,At once both extremely useful and utterly useless.,"The Companion essentially functions as a long annotation for references in the Crying of Lot 49. It does most allusions justice, although we may never know the extent to which Pynchon envisioned his worlds. As an explanation of references, the Companion is quite succesful but it does not entirely meet its expectations as a companion because it lacks any sort of thematic or liteary analysis. It is essentially a reference for reading Pynchon and not a companion per se. Utterly useless as an overarching thematic reading of Pynchon, A Companion to the Crying of Lot 49 should not go underappreciated in its the ability to explain Pynchon's allusions. This book may turn out to be extremely useful or utterly useless, and perhaps both."
4,Waxwing- For madmen only,Waxwings first full length. Full of great sing along tunes that are well put together. Any Waxwing is good Waxwing and it appeals as much to punk as it does for indie fans
3,Good book.,"It's a good book, but a little thin on actual math (ex: calculating motion ratios, natural frequency, damping factor, etc). It's also thin on practical applications like setting up corner weighting, or the effects of compression/rebound settings, shock technology, etc. It's a good read, but not the end-all reference."
4,Best thing you can get for $50,"I hate those little dongle things that most laptop EtherNet cards have, so this is a good sollution. Linksys makes good enough cards for most people and I like this better than the dongle. However, 3com, and Xircom both do a much better job with the ""dongleless"" laptop cards; however, they cost significantly more. If cost is a factor, and you hate the dongle this is a great sollution. If you can afford them, the other cards work better, and the connection part is more functional than this one."
1,Horrible Linksys tech support--netgear a much better product,"I previously used Linksys PCMPC100 until the ""tail"" broke on my coupler, so I tried the PCM200. I spent 2 days with 5 different techs from Linksys trying to install the PCM200 with Windows 98 without success. I even spoke with a Linksys supervisor that pretty much admitted they didn't know what they were doing. I also spent an hour on the phone with my OEM who also wasn't able to help me install. I returned the Linksys PCM200 for Netgear FA511, which I was able to install myself in 5 minutes. I'm not sure whether Linksys has a bad product or just bad tech support, but for me Netgear was a much better buy."
3,Typical Englist TV show.,"Good story. Rather low actor play. Main Hero is a weak person, who would prefer many people to die, rather than turn violent and solve the problem once and for all. That's what they teach people in England now - be dependent, better cry and hide than fight. Be a sheep. But still, worthy enough to watch once."
1,Dumb british shit show,I just wasted 10 minutes of my life watching this garbage or rubbish like crooked teeth brits like to say
5,Buffy? AHS? TWD? Great horror TV. And The Fades is better.,"I consume copious amounts of media via Amazon, and I rarely bother to review any of it here. It's a rare AMZ review that piques my interest or influences my choices. It's more rare that something would spur me to write one.The Fades deserves attention, not just from horror fans, but from anyone who enjoys a good story and appreciates fine acting, great writing, and solid film-making (provided they can tolerate some gore and flesh). An excellent mix of wit, drama, sex, mythos, pop culture, and of course horror, executed with uncompromising production values and in the discerning style that keeps BBC TV in a league of it's own.I'll leave the synopsis to other reviewers, and I honestly don't expect anyone to watch the show based on this missive. I just wanted to go on record as being a fan.It's a shame the first season is also the last. Free for Amazon Prime members."
5,Simple and straight forward for any beginner,The book was very useful for me considering I am new to electronic trading. I am currently using cybertrader software and in the back their is an appendix explaining the cybertrader and real tick platform.
2,Some good mostly poor,"There have been many books written since day trading became the next ""gold rush."" Many have presented a clear concise view of the dangers and pitfalls of day trading. This book does highlight many of the dangers of day trading. The book does not present sufficient information to begin properly day trading. There is no detail regarding how to identify entry/exit points, best brokers, the costs of commissions vs paid data feeds, and most important how to recognize when you are ""churning"" your own account. The risks and rewards of day trading are no different from investing in any of the financial markets. Unless you know what you are doing you are going to lose money. Unfortunatly, this book does not provide you sufficient information to begin day trading on a profitable level."
1,Yuk!,"My husband got these because he read that it would help his back pain. I tried one and if that's all I had to eat on a desert, then I guess I'd starve. I did not like the taste and I do like many different things, but this is icky! :)"
2,Crystalized ginger,I have been buying Australian Crystalized Ginger from Sweet Energy company for a long time. Very tasty product but ridiculously expensive. I therefore decided to give the current item a try. It is a haphazard mix of good and bad pieces. But what is very curious is the texture and substance of each piece. If I could take a wild guess I would say that these pieces seem to be mashed ginger blended with sugar then compacted and molded into solid feeling coins. On the outside too there is entirely too much sugar.All in all this product is not up to par.
5,Good cookbook,It's great to have recipes made especially for the crock pot. I love being able to put dinner on in the morning before work and still be able have low carb food.
4,excellent even for those not pushed for time,"I have recently discovered slow cooking and this book is fantastic, even though i have more time to cook in the oven i find the process of slow cooking so much more tasty and it makes the meat more tender. A favourite at the momment is the sweet and sour pork, suitably de carbed off course, I have got into the habit off putting the slow cooker onlate at night and then having the food ready to take as a packed lunch in the morning. Pot poasts which i never managed to get just right are now meltingly beautiful, Dana as usual provides a wonderful cookbook"
3,"Good for inspiration, but somewhat unnatural and very unpractical","The cookbook has a lot of interesting ideas and aromas to explore, but in the end of the day, you cannot rely on it to cook your meals.First of all, there are too many carbs in the recipes to be properly called 'low-carb'. Often you find recipes with 6g carbs but 200kcal each portion. If you are taking 1600kcal/day in two meals, that leaves you with 32g of carbs in just one meal - too much for a ketogenic diet, for example. The recipes are also often high-protein and low-fat, with skinless chicken and this kind of thing, and you need to change them quite considerably to fit your needs and then recalculate the calories, which is a hassle.I'm also quite bothered by the amount of crap in the ingredient lists. Xanthan gum, sweeteners, soy, fake this and fake that... Sorry, ma'am, I won't even feed my dogs like this.I think it's worth reading it, but it could have been much, much better."
3,"Nothing ""spectacular"" about this release.","I'm afrain I have to agree with the reviews that dis this boxed set. This release is mediocre at best. Once BCI had obtained the legal rights to release Ultraman, they had the option to seek out prints from different sources if the ones they were provided with were poor. But I am not conviced that the versions they were handed were of poor quality. I believe that all the defects here are in the digitatal video production and transfer and not in the prints they were provided. The audio noise and video imperfections are the result of poor production and manufacture on the part of BCI. The choppy stilted movement of the video is a digital fowl-up. The noise in the audio could have been removed quite easily if they had only taken the time to do so. They just didn't care to."
3,"Good quality product, but don't believe the hype","The most that this product did for me was firm the outline of my lips slightly. There was no discernible plumping other than the illusion of outlining your lips. However, I like the color and texture of the product so I will still buy this product as I would any other lipstick -- just not for any plumping action."
3,Stains the lips for an all day blush effect,"This does not really plump anything, but it is a great way to create a semi permanent stain on the lips. This color name, Buff, is not representative of the actual color. It is pepto-bismol pink. It is a luster finish at first, and as it wears off, it leaves behind a rosy stain that actually looks better than the lip color itself.No plumping, but nice stain."
1,It just doesn't work!,"I have several different brand 1394 cards for my business; The D-Link is one I brought for my personal use. It is terrible! It is slow, it often looses connections, and it doesn't work with certain devices.Just to make sure I didn't have a bad unit, I switched it out with second one. It unit didn't work either. I have several of them and they all have the same horrible functionality. Buy an Adaptec or a PYRO, or a SIIG. They are far superior!"
1,What a piece of crap!,"Who would I recommend this product to? Windows 98 users who won't be upgrading to ME.The product will not work with Windows ME, period. I called tech support, there was nothing they could do. There are NO drivers available for this product on Windows ME. If you trying installing the drivers, it will freeze your pc every time you turn on your dv camcorder. I recommend Windows ME users do NOT buy this device, as D-LINK corp obviously DOES NOT care at all about their customers using a more recent version of Windows.I certainly thought I was getting a bargain deal when buying this from Amazon.Com. Boy was I wrong!"
5,An excellent grammar reference guide for Greek,"Anybody who desires to master the Greek language will benefit immensely by having this book as a resource. The language is broken down and explained with the aid of thousands of examples from everyday Greek. Well presented and easy to navigate, reference to this book will clear up any ambiguities you encounter while learning Greek. It is the reference guide I have been looking for."
2,Your better off skipping this one!!,"The information provided inside this reference book is ok; however many of the phone numbers and web site links are outdated. I noticed some info was provided with a notation at the bottom that ""As of such and such date, this is no longer available"" Why even print that info in the first place, if not to just fill in useless space. As a PI, your better off getting usufull info on a PI site. Just my $.02 worth."
1,Not That Good,"I found the information in this book extensive, but for experienced Internet investigative P.I.'s this book is redundant.Just for a test I sampled some items in the book and they were on the Interent, and easily found with keyword searches. It was also lacking good information on computer forensics investigator contacts, and how they support general practice PI's. ""Digital Evidence"" IS THE problem for the PI in the 21st Century."
3,And The Wind Cries Ravenstone!,"I think this release stacks up well against comparable early releases by the gods of the Athens music scene - REM's ""Radio Free Europe"" and ""Chronic Town"" (with the added advantage that you can actually understand the lyrics on ""Back on the Rock"") and the B-52's ""Rock Lobster"" (with the added advantage that Ravenstone actually has some music chop suey to go along with their humorous observations.) It'll be interesting to see where the band goes from here."
3,ok,"I don't drink much cofee, so this sistem one cup at the time is great for me. The bad thing is that this one speal wather so, is cain of measy and the coffee bags are expensives and hard to get, I only found them at Target."
4,Good for that one cup drinker,"I have had my Juan Valdez coffee pod brewer for over a year. I love it. You have to make sure that the pod is inserted properly and you don't have spills or splashes. As far as using other pods I have and do. All you have to do is make sure the paper edges are tucked in so you don't break the seal, otherwise you will have coffee and splashes. I couldn't believe all the negative results other people have had with this product. I ordered one for my daughter-in-law for Christmas as she liked mine so well."
5,The True Story of Theresa the Most Beautiful Rose,"This is a poignant story that touched me particularly, since I'm a Cancer survivor, as well as the father of 5 daughters. This book should be a must-read for families of Cancer victims. Nancy Moore shares the experience vividly and with great compassion. Theresa was a valiant fighter, as well as a ""beautiful rose""."
