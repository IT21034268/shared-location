3,More atmosphere than substance,"This book is, in my opinion, very well written, and it just might be its weak point because (also in my opinion) the story didn't really deliver what the writing promised. It is indeed, as others have said, creative and character-driven, but unfortunately, the plot seems to lack structure. For that reason, the ending felt a bit anti-climatic to me. If it were a book from some clueless beginning indie, I would give it a 4, but as it comes from an author with a great potential, it should be a 3 on his scale. I will look forward to his next books and am sure that one day I'll run out of stars rating his next works.Alex"
4,Decent if a little dated,"Surprisingly good for somewhat dated sci-fi. The interactions between Bandicut and his Quarx were good, as was the development of their relationship.It might not be for everyone. As the synopsis/review said, the budding relationship between Bandicut & Julie seemed trite and the xenophobia angle an unnecessary (and forced) addition to an already light-hearted save-the-world tale. But again, that was probably the norm for its day. The ending might not satisfy some readers but this is the first in a series.Those quibbles aside, it was an enjoyable tale."
1,"good story, BAD hyphens","This is an impressive first novel. The setting is both totally unfamiliar and engrossing. The characters are well-drawn. The mystery is . . . satisfyingly mysterious, although not very baffling.However, after paying nearly $10 for the Kindle version, I find myself constantly dis-tracted by un-necessary hyphens which ap-pear in the text in totally inappropriate places. This is a con-version issue and should not happen to any author's work that is being sold for more than a dollar. Changing the text size or the orientation of the Kindle makes no difference. So, to the author: 5 stars. To the person who converted this, no stars at all. This is entirely un-ac-ceptable."
4,Esta Vida magnifico,"Was at a party with a bunch Colombianos last week when they put on a video of Jorge Celedon singing Esta Vida. Knocked me out of the chair. Que cantante, con ganas.The lyrics are clean and fresh, the melody carries you along. Then I listened to the rest of the Para el Mundo CD and now I'm a confirmed Celedonista.Â¡Hechale Jorgito!"
1,Terrible,"This product took an hour to install on my fast gaming PC, and then I could not get it to work. I updated my DVD drive firmware, graphics card drivers, etc., as suggested by Roxio, no dice. What a terrible piece of non-working bloatware.Then I tried Nero 7, which installed in about 10 minutes and worked perfectly out of the box."
1,This program sucks!,"My computer met ALL requirements to run this program. This program made my computer crash causing me to lose some valuable information, which I was lucky to get from a few sources. When finally installed and working, it took almost 8 hours to burn a 2 hour DVD, and this was after the editing. And after the 8 hour burn, the DVD didn't work properly on my DVD player. I wasted good money on this product only to be disappointed. I don't think I am the only one."
1,Absolute garbage,"Horrid piece of junk- none of my video files could be added because they're supposedly ""uneditable and thus were not added to the project."" Spent an hour trying to product a simple DVD of one video- I can't believe I paid money for such a BS fussy program. Have the guys at Sonic even tried using their own software?"
1,Very disappointing,"This book is a story about about Scleroderma and the people who had it. If you want to read about the treatment, simply go to the article written in the Lancet. Do not waste your money on this book thinking it will give you steps to doing treatment. It rehashes all the HORRIBLE things Scleroderma does to the body through the eyes of the people who had it and their family members. Yes, it talks about this ""miracle"" therapy, but this book was a waste of my time and money. Simply read about the treatment in the Lancet article which I am sure you can do for free."
1,Have you noticed?!,"Have you noticed that almost all the five-star reviews of this book are actually ""testimonials"" copied from the book, itself?! Apparently these were all inserted either by the author or the editor. Such a thing should not have been allowed."
4,"If you or someone you love has scleroderma, read this book!","This book outlines the treatment of this devasting disease with common antibiotics that have been on the market for years and used with no harmful side effects. I personally, have tried this method. In two years I have had remarkable improvement with reversal of symptoms in a disease for which there is supposed to be no cure. In short, I have my life back. This author has done a great service to those who suffer from scleroderma in making this information available."
4,"Excellent, upbeat",I love this compilation. When I got it I listened to it on loop for days while I worked and never got tired of it.
5,Wonderful!,This is a great book for children and adults alike to remind them of the wonderful gift we have in the Mass. My son and I thoroughly enjoyed it and am looking forward to taking it to his class to read this year. The story is great but knowing that it is based on a true miracle makes it even more powerful!
4,Would make a lovely little movie,"I read this book many years ago and had very fond memories of it...started looking for a copy and bought one via Internet several months ago.This book would make a lovely ""period"" piece of a movie. The book has so much to say about being open to new experiences and respect for other cultures--wonderfully nuanced as to the different points of view of the characters--and it is such a sweet love story.Just saw Frances McDormand's new movie yesterday Miss Pettigrew lives for a day--which has much the same light-weight world within a bubble atmosphere and was totally enjoyable because it was so well done...McDormand produced it so you know it was book she fell in love with--no studio would have touched it otherwise and married to the Cohen god she has lots of arms to twist ...wish someone with that same type of clout would discover Miss One Thousand Spring Blossoms..."
5,"KKSF 103.7 FM Sampler for Aids Relief, Vol. 9",The cd was terrific and the buyer was great to deal with. The cd arrived very fast and in great condition. Thank you!
5,Wonderful gift for parents of preemies who have died,"Big George is my hero! This book was an inspiration to me, and I always keep a few at home, just in case someone needs it. This book is a great gift for the grieving parent or family, especially when you don't know what to say. Any acquaintance of mine who is in this boat automatically receives the book. What a sweet story!!"
3,"Interesting, but not enough...","I believe this book is aimed for small, start-up ISPs. I think it does not cover with enough detail some very important topics like subscriber management systems, billing strategies, customer care strategies, etc. These are the key elements to be taken into account when a system grows."
2,Stopper doesn't have enough pressure to seal well.,"We currently own a champagne stopper that works well but I wanted a backup for my kids sparkling beverages. I purchased the Farberware model for the backup. Unfortunately, I am not happy with the new stopper because it does not function properly. Simply put, the distance between the stopper and the two ""latches"" that attach to the neck of the bottle is too large so when the stopper is attached there isn't enough pressure between the rubber stopper and the bottle to make a good seal. The result is that rather than hearing a ssssss when the stopper is removed you get more of a pfftt. Luckily, the shipping was free so I am only out the cost of the stopper."
4,Excellent for keeping Champagne fresh,"Keeps fresh, cost-wise fair price. Be careful when removing after first use and subsequent, as there is air pressure. Can't keep the champagne for more than 2 days or so, or it will lose bubbles."
5,Best champagne stopper,"This stopper might be more expensive, but worth the price. Super good looking and functional. Keeps the bottle tightly sealed, and champagne bubbly for a week."
3,Poor workmanship on product,Seed has trouble coming out under the plastic sides.Side pockets for suet cake are too narrow to fit the suet..
2,Be cautious!,"The civilization claimed in this book has very poor morality in India. This civilization created ""division"" or ""caste"" among peaceful Indians and inflicted numerous atrocities among innocent civilians. Though this fact does not directly relate to the claim this book makes, I request readers however to be cautious in accepting the facts laid down in this book without consulting references and other supporting articles."
1,"Brainless, thoughtless... pointless.","That's all I really need to say. It applies to many of these ""millenium collections"", but particularly to this one, because the Velvet Underground were such a not-hit-oriented band. Why did the company even BOTHER putting this out? If you're interested in the V.U., be brave and buy one of their albums. It will almost certainly be better than this."
1,Not for kids...,"This movie is NOT for young kids even though the back of the DVD case shows a dog getting a bath and states ""this is a family movie"". My kids were balling their eyes out when the dogs were getting put to sleep. I should have watched it first - LIVE AND LEARN!!!"
2,Fluke... more like Puke,"If not for Samual Jackson's riviting performance as a squirrel I would have given this movie one star. Normally I trust Libby Whittemore's integrity in choosing projects (That Darn Cat; Wife, Mother, Murderer) but here she was barking up the wrong tree.Bad man returns as bad dog to torture his inocent family and best friend nearly killing two of them. I also thought the shower scene was in bad taste. Definitily not for children."
1,NOT for little children,This movie is definitely not for little kids. I bought the Fluke/Napoleon set for my 2 year old daughter because she loves puppies. Napoleon was PERFECT! But Fluke was an awful movie. It had 2 people dying and a dog getting shot with a gun in it (I don't want to introduce her to violence). I threw the movie away-what a waste of money.
3,sebastiane,"My copy of the Kino DVD is full screen and not letterboxed as advertised. Several seconds have been deleted from the perhaps too long slow motion sequence with frolicking bathers - but these seconds are important and Jarman captured a natural and realistic event knowing full well what he was doing . I acquired the DVD to replace my old VHS version and while it is superior in many ways, I will keep the video as the true version and the one I saw originally on the movie screen."
5,Delighted with quick response!,"The book hasn't been read yet, but the book arrived in perfect shape and at a good price. I was delighted with the speed with which the book arrived at my home."
5,"The Legendary Bruce Springsteen Confirms His ""BOSS"" Status!","Bruce Springsteen has made me realize that great music has been non-existent for years. The last time I heard music this good was when ""Born To Run"", ""Darkness"" & ""The River"" came out. This is a remarkable set. Of course there are songs that you wish he would have included, such as, a personal favorite, ""Jeannie Needs A Shooter"", but you can't have everything. AWESOME!!!"
2,Disappointing... lots of songs too weak to make the cut.,"Repetitive and ultimately uninteresting... and I'm a big Springsteen fan. Most of the best stuff has been released before. Maybe there was a time when this would have thrilled me, but now I'm just over-saturated with this stuff. I had to get it to complete my collection, but I actually regret it. Save your cash... let's not reward Bruce for this kind of crap."
2,"Great songs that ""sound"" poor.","Hear is another example of the lie we have been force fed of digital=""perfect sound forever"".This is an all time classic collection of one of our most important musical artists that is unfortunatly strapped with an almost unlistenable sound. Unless you are listening to it on a boom box/kmart rack system, the sound of these disks is thin, flat, one dimensional and very fatiguing (aka digititis). Its hard to beleive these were actually remastered. No wonder vinyl is making a comeback. Analog sounds like the real thing.I want to restate that I think this is a great work of art. It just could be worlds better if the recording industry gave a damn and would put some emphasis on recording sound quality. If we vote with our dollars, they will follow."
2,LIVING PROOF- THE PAST IS DEAD,"i RESERVED MY BOXED SET WEEKS BEFORE IT CAME OUT. WHEN MEDIA PLAY RELEASED IT AT MIDNIGHT I WAS THERE TO PICK IT UP. TUESDAY I TOOK THE DAY OFF FROM WORK AND WAITED UNTIL MY GIRLFRIEND WAS OUT OF THE HOUSE. I PUT ALL FOUR DISCS ITO THE CD CHANGER, SAT ON THE COUCH FACING THE SPEAKERS, AND PREPARED MYSELF TO BE TOTALLY BROUGHT FACE TO FACE WITH THE BRUCE I REMEMBERED. I WAS BORED. AND N MY BOREDOM I REALIZED THE 70S AND 80S ARE GONE. THE REASONS BRUCE WAS SO POWERFUL THEN ARE GONE. I'VE GROWN UP, BRUCE MOVED TO L.A., WE ARE NO LONGER THE DEFIANT THROWING OUR RIGHT FISTS INTO THE AIR AT ONE OF HIS THREE HOUR SHOWS. THE SONGS WEREN'T MOVING, THEY DIDN'T BRING MUCH EMOTION TO MY HEART. WHAT THEY DID WAS REMIND ME THAT THE BRUCE WE LISTENED TO BACK THEN NO LONGER EXISTS. IT WAS LOOKING AT OLD PHOTOS, BRINGING BACK THE MEMORIES WITHOUT THE SUBSTANCE. SOMETIMES THINGS ARE BETTER LEFT IN THE BOX"
2,"If it is so good, why it was never released???","Of course Bruce is a prolific songwriter, a real master. But to fill four, I repeat, four CD's with previoulsy unreleased material provoke, at least, a little suspicion... Even Springsteen could not manage to write such a great number of tunes and leave them out in the cold for so long... So, I recommend you to listen to this compilation first befoer buying it..."
2,Worthless,We had flying squirrels in our attic. This product did nothing! I had to use rat traps to get rid of them.
1,Nearly useless as it falls apart,"I've had my PMX 100s for a month now, and already they're in pieces. The mechanism used to hold the driver to the neckband isn't very good and is not meant to be repairable. The drivers also wobble around. Once they come out of the neckband, it's game over. The foam pads easily fall off as well. And the comfort? ...What comfort? These are less comfortable than almost any other neckband style headphone I have worn.The sound quality is OK (perhaps spoiled as I am used to higher end cans like the HD600), but the durability and lack of comfort make these cans unwearable and unusable."
5,Best sounding sport headphones,"These are the best sounding neckband style headphones I have found. They seem a bit delicate with exposed wires running to each earpiece but they are very comfortable and sound great. I also bought a pair of PMX60 which seem a bit more rugged and are somewhat cheaper. They sound OK as well but not as good as the PMX100. I use both but when listening to music, the PMX100 are the choice."
2,"Great sound, not durable","I bought these in April after an extensive search for great sounding headphones. I used Sennheiser at my workplace, so I was eager to get these phones. The sound has been great, and they made my commute much nicer as l listened to my music on the bus. However, I noticed that the plastic coating the wire was no longer attached at the jack. I tried to remedy this with electric tape, and this worked fine... until today. When I pressed play on my ipod, I was devastated to only hear sound from the right phone.I love the Sennheiser's sound quality, however, these are not the most durable headphones. I used them everyday and I am not sure what would cause the coating to detach from the jack. Needless to say, I am very disappointed."
2,sounds good but looks very weird,These headphones have a two inch gap between my head and the plastic that wraps around your head. I have a normal head size and unless you have really puffy hair these headphones will not look good on you. I feel like a looser when i wear them.
2,Terrible Durability,"I've owned 3 different PMX 100 headphones over the past three years. The use was intermittent with PMX 60 headphones which are also very good but the sound is not as great as the PMX 100. Problem is, after a few months of use the connection started to tear apart. It's very sad to see this happen three times. I've decided not to purchase a PMX 100 anymore. The durability is a disaster and it's not worth it for the great sound it has."
5,Great standby pair of headphones.,"I usually only use these when I'm shopping or going running, and for that they're great. The sound quality is great and comfortable enough I can use them for hours on end; my only complaint is it's a little awkward to rest my head with the headphones on. They're not as tight as some people have been saying, but considering the sound quality, excellent 2 year warranty and fit they're a great deal for 40 bucks."
3,The music fails to keep up with the lyrics,"J-Live is always going to have a special place in my heart, but this album just did not have the same feel I expected from a J-Live album. Lyrically, Justice is just as he always is, killing the mics left and right. But musically, this album is flat. There is a lot of what sorts like stale 808 drums driving the beats, and the decidedly dark quality of most of the songs is overbearing by the end of the record. Overall, pretty solid, but ""Then What Happened?"" and ""All Of The Above"" are better primers for anyone out there considering getting into one of the greatest MCs of our time."
5,Great deal!,"After ordering a bunch of cheaper furniture for a new apartment and having things break, this was a welcome surprise. The final assembled product looks really nice, and the drawer slides smoothly. Took me about an hour to assemble (mostly just getting all the parts in the right order and making sure specific surfaces were facing the right way.) Really nice looking nightstand for the price."
2,looks good... from far away,"fast delivery from Amazon, easy to put together. needed something small for a office / guest room. shelves were real wood pieces with multiple imperfections in them. bottom shelf sits higher in the back and 2 of the screws went diangle through the shelf splitting the wood because the pre-drilled holes were offset. I also have to go over all of the joints / seams with a stain marker to fill in all of the white spots.. skip it"
2,Not that sturdy,"It was driving me crazy not having a night table on my side of the bed so I could have my own alarm clock that wasn't on the floor.At first I was very excited about this table that my wife bought me but then I found that it got pretty wobbly over time. I dont think it was constucted very well and the finish seems to be changing in some spots.all and all though, not a bad price if you dont expect too much."
1,Truly sad,"You get what you pay for! This is cheaply made! None of the holes lined up. What should have been an easy and simply assembly, took forever. I had to keep taking breaks trying to tighten up screws. I purchased two but only assembled one and ended up donating both! If only the holes would have lined up better it would have been a cute item. Never again and NO THANK YOU!"
2,Large Deep Scratch on Top,"Bought two for guest room. For a room that is not used for 11 months a year, I decided to go cheap with night stands.I did not expect anything decent, and even was prepared to use marker to cover some blemishes. BUT, a deep scratch on top in one of the two tables. If the scratch is inside,I will live with it...But...no way for outside.Assembled the good one in 1 hour. Longer than I originally expected. It is easy structure, you won't go wrong. Screw holes are very shallow/small. My power screwdriver wasn't able to send the screw into the hole. Literally some strength needed to push the screws in manually. I'm a petite female, and was able to manage it, you can do it for sure, just with some strength and extra time.Overall, I am surprised Amazon hasn't discontinued this product."
3,Question,I haven't bought this item yet but am looking into it to use them as end tables for a living room. Has anyone used them for this purpose and have they held up for the price I am not excecting much but need SOMETHING. If anyone could help me here that would be great thank you!!
2,Just OK,"Last night when i was assembling the piece, i was cursing the purchase of it. When i reviewed the price today, i understood why. Its pretty cheap - both cost and quality. A few of the screws stripped during assembly and the instructions could have had some more detail (from a woman's perspective). I guess it'll serve us for its purpose... family room with young kids and likely to be beaten up."
4,So far so good,"I purchases two of these tables and so far, I have only minor complaints. A few scratches here and there when they arrived, but after I put them together, they feel stable. I'm pretty happy with them considering the low price. I would like the drawer to be a bit more secure and precise in it's fit, but I don't put much in them yet so it's not an issue thus far."
1,Fell Apart During Assembly,I don't even normally write reviews for items but I feel the need to express that this is the worst piece of furniture I've ever bought. The wood fell apart upon assembly. Spend a little more and get something better.
5,"Easy to assemble, sturdy, perfect for price!!!","Great value! Easy to assemble, and very sturdy (I was surprised, based on the low price). They look great! Would highly recommend."
1,Difficult to assemble and poorly made,"I didn't expect much from this item, but I was still disappointed. My table had the magic marker touchup that others noted, but they missed a big scratch on the front of the drawer.I've assembled a lot of cheap furniture before. This table was harder to assemble than most. It's all put together with screws. The large screws that attach the legs took a lot of force. I needed to use my own screwdriver after the supplied Allen wrench stripped.My table was actually defective: one pair of holes mating the leg with the table was misaligned. The screw went in at an angle. The table was wobbly as a result.I was going to live with it until I found that two of the screws that attach the table top had actually penetrated the top! The table top is not even thick enough to hold the screws!"
1,Very low quality,"Very low quality, screws barely fit,night stand is very unstable, it's a pain to assemble it, definitely didn't expect a problem like that."
2,Cheap Cheap Cheap,"Upon arrival this thing was already scratched on the top surface and had a crack in the wood. The pilot holes didn't line up either, got it put together but it took way more effort than it should. I guess that's what you get with cheap furniture. I wouldn't buy from this seller or company again."
3,It'll do for the money.,"The tables are easy to assemble but the wood is soft and the finish will scratch, so be careful. Once set up they look good, not great but they are a definite value for the price. Great for kids rooms (if you have dark markers to cover up scratches) or dorm rooms or basements. These are not exactly fancy but can spruce up a room well."
4,"Nice product, instructions lacking","I like the look and the quality (for the price) of the product. It is perfect for what I needed. However, there are a couple of points in the assembly instructions that are lacking. There are two pieces that if you don't put them on in the correct direction (the instructions don't specify which way), you'll either have to paint black or disassemble and reassemble the entire table. So, have some black paint handy - that is what I did and it looks fine. Also, the drawer stop can be put on two different ways - the instructions don't tell you which way. I put it on wrong, therefore the drawer can be pulled out all the way without stopping. I didn't think this was important enough for me to disassemble the table to correct. I do like the look of the table though - very functional."
3,nice,Ordered 3 2 went together perfect but one didnt have all the pices. the ones that are together are great. however you can guess how i'm feeling about the third.
4,worth buying,It's very easy to assemble. The holes were cut right. minus 1 star for the hex screws. Phillips would be better.
3,My wife really loved it,"I thought it was pretty good. The cinematography is gorgeous, of course, and the strangness of the battles half on ground and half in the air is intriguing, but ultimately I had a hard time becoming involved with the characters. My wife didn't have that problem. Maybe this is a martial arts chick-flick. It's time they made one."
3,NOT THE ORIGINAL FROM THE THEATER !!!!!,WELL I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE ON DVD BEFORE IT WAS RELESED HERE IN THE STATES AND THE VERSION I HAVE JUST ADDS THE ENGLISH DUBB. NOT ALL THE RCE [garbage]AND DELETED PARTS AND SUBS OUT OF THE MOVIE. THATS THE REASON FOR THE THREE STARS. IF YOU NEVER SAW THE MOVIE BEFORE BUYING OR RENTING THIS DVD YOU WONT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE MISSING. I THINK ITS FUNNY. AND I DONT MEAN THE MOVIE!!!!
2,Cute... but weak story.,Jesus.. this was really boring. Only martial art lovers may like this film. Lacked emotion.
1,Overrated Garbage,"I can NOT believe how overrated this film is! ""Best film ever made""? Hardly. Some [people] even compared it with ""Gladiator"" as the best film of 2000. That is totally ridiculous. ""Gladiator"" was a summer blockbuster but it also was a movie with compelling sympathetic charcaters and incredible action. Crowe's Maximus is a lovable characte who captures people's hearts. The same thing can not be said about anyone in ""Crouching Tiger"". This film is filled with irritating awful characters who I didn't care at all about. The young girl in the film is downright annoying. Also, the special effects of this movie are so overrated it isn't even funny. We have all seen the same type of effects in Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan movies. Why is this one so special??? In short Crouching Tiger is just a long terrible movie with Chinese people flying around ..."
5,One of the best movies I've ever seen,"I agree that the popularity and artistic merit of this movie is somewhat controversial.I watched this first time around in its original Chinese version with subtitles (Like all other dubbed movies, dubbed version tends to destroy the movie)I think this is one of the best martial arts movie made, as well as erotic (I don't mean that in the sense of porn or anything. Yun Fat Chow and ZHang Ziyi's fight scene in the forest near the end was one of the scenes that I thought was very memorable..)It is not a typical Hollywood comedy-martial arts film like Rush Hour or anything, but I think the director did a fantastic job with this film.I highly recommend it for anyone."
3,"Great movie, *terrible* dub","I love Crouching Tiger, it's one of my very favorite movies, but it gave me a nasty shock when the first line came out as ""Li is back!!"" not in Chinese.It got worse from there. While the voices for Shu-lien and Li Mu Bai were alright (they were probably done by Michelle Yoah and Chow Yun-Fat, who can speak english), Shao-Long's (Jen) and Lo's and pretty much everyone else's were really bad. It also became confusing. Jade Fox was not only referred to as 'Jade Fox' but as something in Chinese as well, an attempt at retaining bits of the original, I suppose, but a pretty pathetic one.This is a movie that deserves to be kept as close to the original as possible, not Americanized in the slightest. Dubbing destroys it."
5,None better.,"What the God Father did for crime films and 2001 for science fiction, Crouching Tiger has done for martial arts films. Beyond the incredible fight scenes, that are almost ballet in nature, the story is what carries this movie."
4,Good but......,"not perfect. This was the first foriegn film that I had seen in the theater's. While it was amazing and kept my attention (I even forgot that I was reading subtitles after a while) it wasn't one of the most mind-blowing or moving movies I've seen. The effects were awesome, as were all of the fights, but thats about it. The acting was OK, and the production values were good as well. Overall, this doesn't live up to all the hype, and did not deserve all the Academy Awards it got (However, Best Foriegn Language was aptly and rightfuly won) but it is still entertaining and enjoying to watch."
3,avrege and a little boring,This movie was fast in the begining and I figured it would remain good but it got a little dull in the middle to the point were it was hard for me to pay attention but then it got better at the end. It was boring here and there and fast paced some other times. I say take it or leave it but i was dissipointed because thought it would be better then it was. Maybe I was just expecting too much but who could blame me it got so many good ratings and awards.
2,Hybrid product.,"Weak story, good cinematography and fighting. The relationship between characters is a little mixed with freudian homosexuality. But it is not the worst movie, at all."
1,"Hey!, Give Me Back My Comb!","Man This Movie [stinks]! If I Got The DVD I Would Be Skipping To The Fight Sense. Iron Monkey Is WAY Better, (pertaining to the fighting). CTHD Had WAY too much wire work, at least IM Made it look Pretty And fancy. Theses People Are Just Hopping From Building To Building And From Tree To Tree Like Nothing, What The Hell Is This, FIGHT!!! I hated this movie. That Part About The Girl Going After Her Comb Was BORING, That Took Up TOO Much Time In The Moive. If Your Looking For ""Action"" That Actually Involes A Certain Stlye, And Not Just Some Dumb Flying, Then Get ""Iron Monkey""!!"
1,ONE OF THE WORST MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!,"For a martial arts movie, it stinks. The acting is so slow and boring I almost fell asleep. Even the few awful fight sequences failed to wake me up. The ""flying"" sequences are so artificial too. Where on earth did they learn to fly like that? Come on, get real, man.Now, if you want to watch a truly great martial arts movie, I strongly recommend either ""Once Upon A Time In China"" starring Jet Li (before he started acting in those bad Hollywood movies) or ""Iron Monkey"" starring the fantastic Donnie Yen. Those are truly GREAT martial arts movies. Do yourself a favour, avoid ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""... a great disappointment! It doesn't even deserve the one Star rating."
3,Disapointing,"This movie had a lot of great reviews, but I didn't think it was that great. The biggest problem I had with the movie is that is was all in subtitles. They should have done a version in English. Most of the battle sequences were lame, just people throwing darts at each other or chasing each other around on roof tops. With all the great publicity the movie got I expected it to be better. Even though I was disapointed, the movie is worth seeing if you don't mind subtitles. The thing I did like was the acting, Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh did a great job. I also like the ending, it wasn't what I expected to happen."
1,in spanish...horrible pelicula...,"la fui a ver y lo mejor fueron las palomitas...tal parece que quien dirige la pelicula y el autor de la trama se drogaron para hacerla, lo unico que vale la pena es la tela de los vestidos de la protagonista, no entiendo porque se dice que es una buena pelicula o de plano no se nada de cine...ahora veo porque se ofrecen tantos videos usados de esta..."
4,One of the best films to come out of China,"CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, which took in the US ""Best Foreign Language Film"", is one of the best films to come out of China. The music is great, the acting as well, the story is pretty good - but the effects are the traditional wire Chinese style and take down the film a lot. For martial arts fans, it's a must, and the DVD is loaded with stuff."
5,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon",Great photography and fine acting in this swordplay fantasy. Lyrical action and wistful romance mark make this a great movie. The DVD has both the original Mandarin soundtrack and an English dub if you don't like to read subtitles.
4,Beautiful,"Lushly filmed. Strong characters. Fighting would be way over the top, except you need to understand that the film is about mythological warriors who had special fighting powers. Unfortunately, it's established the new standard for fight scenes so that now all martial arts have to be equally unbelievable."
2,Great action and FX but what's all the hype about?,"Now I'm a martial arts fan from before Bruce Lee, but this movie just didn't do it for me. I mean really folks, when's the last time you saw someone walk up a bamboo shoot? Even the FX's were implausible, especially the ""flying"" scenes. Plot was way too predictable. I loved the fight sequences that were on the ground!Really good choreography in those! Is the hype because the Asian market produced a martial arts film that is not cartoon-like?"
1,Gawd AWFUL!!!,"I implored my friends and coworkers to AVOID this [bad] movie at ALL costs. The plot was insipid, the acting overwraught, the special effects were ridiculous &#65533; those in the last Star Wars movie, as dumb as that flick was, were 10 times better than those in this movie. The fight scenes reminded me of those absurd martial arts movies that this movies was supposed to counteract. People who liked it said you had to be able to ""suspend disbelief."" ALL this means is ""disconnect your brain."" NOW I IMPLORE YOU &#65533;&#65533; DO NOT VIEW THIS ATROCIOUS FILM!!"
1,Not good,The sound and picture of the movie are not synchronized. Waste of money. Hope Amazon could solve this problem as soon as possible.
5,One of my all-time favorites,I'm surprised when I talk to so many people who haven't seen this movie. The storyline and special effects are absolutely remarkable. The DVD also has some nice extras - including English overdubs for people who don't like subtitles. This is a DVD you don't want to miss.
5,A Must See!,Everything you could possibly want in a great action/romance (even a touch of fantacy) is in this film. The musical score is the icing on this masterpiece. The characters are wonderful and the subtitles didn't even bother me. I am going to purchase this movie for my collection.
5,Crouching Tiger's Hidden Meaning,"... The movie is an incredible jump from the old martial arts movies, in it's storyline, presentation and action. Awesome special effects. But the viewer is left to interpret it's true meaning and it's ending. Great movie to have none-the-less."
5,Blu-Ray Crouching Tiger Great,"Fine transfer to Blu-ray format. Lovely to look at, would love to have had more extras. But the price was good."
3,wuxia is close to the category of fantasy,"wuxia is close to the category of fantasy , that explains why how they can fly."
5,Visual Feast - Good Story - Awesome Action,"This is a very unusual movie. The fight scenes are incredible but the movie is more than just a vehicle for them. There are plots and subplots all melded seamlessly. The graceful ease with which the actors fly about makes the action all the more surreal. The women are treated as equals and more, their fierceness in battle shatters the stereotype of asian women. The scenery is simply incredible, the director obviously had a wealth of settings to choose from and the choices are spectacular. The pace is good, one's interest is kept by the constant story shifts and scenery changes. Ang Lee has delivered a work for the ages."
3,"Crouching tiger, hidden drama..","I was so hyped going into this movie, that probably no movie could stand up to my expectations, however I managed to judge this movie fairly. While it does have great cinematography and fight scenes, something big is missing from this movie, and I beleive its drama and suspense. Like alot of foreign movies I have seen, you can tell what is gonna happen in every scene. I preordered this DVD cause im a big action buff, and this movie packs a huge action punch. Just dont expect much in the way of emotion and good acting, cause all the characters are hollow at best. In the end, take a story that has been played out in the past, shallow characters, and great fighting and you have a movie that doesnt even come close to true classics like Seven Samurai and Yojimbo."
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"I made a huge mistake in buying this DVD. I believed all the press, and the hype, and boy was I ever disappointed. This movie is dire. Its slow, the acting is mediocre , and the much lauded effects, look cheap. I thought the whole purpose of special effects, was that the look special, and realistic. It was quite obvious that the actors were suspended by wires.Remember the scene in Superman the Movie, when the young Clark Kent races the train, well thats how bad they are...O.K. the cinematogaphy was of the highest level, but, just because it looks good does not mean it is entertainment."
5,...,"this is the most ridiculously awesome movie i have seen in my entire life - kangaroo ninjas!!! it doesn't get any better than that. wow, what a trip ryan, what a trip. makes me want to grow some big back legs and a pouch and learn kung fu. great movie."
1,MGM ARE YOU NUTS?,Why did MGM deliver this in a Non-Box format!!! The laser disc is in widescreen why not the DVD. IT was shot in a 2.35.1 ratio and seeing in in 1.33.1 really is a pitty. I bought the disc but as soon as it was placed in my machine I wish I never bought it. Should have bought the laser disc. I WILL NEVER BY MGM again as long as they continue this stupid practice.On the movie side I liked it very much Ronnie Yu is a great director who can mix action and beauty in the same frame
2,Warriors of Cheesiness,"""Warriors of Virtue"" is a hilariously cheesy movie with martial arts kangaroos, a Chinese cook who puts the Iron Chefs to shame, and the most flamboyant villain this side of the Castro. It steals heavily from ""The Neverending Story"",a mishmash of what might be Taoist philosophy,and even ""Tank Girl"" when it comes to the warrior kangaroos. As in ""Neverending"",a nerdy boy battles the forces of Evil thanks to a magic book. Mario Yedida stars as said nerdy hero, Ryan Jeffers. Angus Macfayden,who's apparently done better work, stars as the flamboyant villain Komodo, who has memorable lines like ""does purple suit me?""There's plenty of exposition. Some long scenes are spent in conversation... with some battle scenes thrown in. For a kiddie movie, it's boring. Being boring and sappy are NOT virtues,despite what this movie might say!"
2,WAUGH,"I'm sorry, but I absolutely hated this film. I can see that the people who made this film were inspired by Eastern philosophy (using the five Chinese elements instead of the four Greek ones) but this movie was just a total wreck. The one female Warrior is presented stereotypically, with flowers and everything. It was obvious she was just the token female character and nothing more, and the villain was downright laughable, and the whole 'virtue' thing is overplayed. This film is so cheesy I could slice it and put it on my crackers."
5,This Is John Lennon!,"Gut wrenching stuff here bound together musically as only John's genius could. The frankness of the tunes (Working Class Hero, I Found Out ... both shocking when this LP was first released) are brassy, yet alluring and intriguing. John meant to shock ... after all he was crying out loudly in public. The personal angst echoes through the untamed Mother. This is a meeting of the real Lennon with the Beatle veneer removed. Unrestained rock, but yet a touching personal meeting with John. Perfect complement to McCartney's tuneful first solo album."
5,A Piece of Artwork! No arguments!,"This album is definitely John Lennon's best album, and it is proves that he didn't need the Beatles anymore. This album is full of angry songs (""Well Well Well"", ""Working Class Hero"", ""I Found Out"", ""Mother""), soothing songs (""Love"", ""Hold On"", ""Remember"", ""Isolation""), and sad songs (""Mother"", ""Look At Me"", ""My Mummy's Dead""). The only complaint I have is ""Well Well Well"", which is annoying old after a while of just hearing John scream ""Well"" at the top of his lungs, and it doesn't mean much to me. However, the rest of the album is so emotional, I couldn't sleep at night not giving this one 5 stars. John Lennon makes a Hell of a statement here. The old rock and roll John is gone completely, replaced by a John Lennon who is full of ideas and feelings. It is an awesome transition, and it is the best album he has ever done."
3,John's Peaks and Valleys Show here.,"I bought this one when it came out, I think in 1970. At the time,it did seem like a lot of anger, angst, and self-confession of a mainly dismal kind. I thought GOD and WORKING CLASS HERO were mini-masterpieces, one of a kind. True, they're one of a kind all right,but not necessarily the kind we would want to hear too often now, perhaps. Their messages have dated, and now are surely not unique. ISOLATION has it's strange moments, like most of this effort, and a certain haunting depth even now. For the most part,much of the rest is mainly of interest to psychologists (again John as child of his long lost mother), or John fanatics,which I am no longer.But, I still like LOVE and LOOK AT ME, both perhaps sublime messages to Yoko. WELL,WELL,WELL and I FOUND OUT probably fit his scream therapy prescription, and seem unlistenable. Still, it's hard to be critical of John, even now, given his sad ending."
5,Portrait of the Artist...,"To claim that this album is among the top three or four Rock records ever produced is NOT an overstatement. This is a true classic, a brilliant, stark portrait in alternately primitive and intricate strokes of melody and words that is just as moving today as it was when it was released almost thirty years ago. One of the few Beatles solo discs to reach the heights of the Best of The Beatles, this is a must-own disc for anyone interested in The Beatles, Lennon, 70's singer-songwriter personalities..this is the bedrock upon which much was built. No one else could write such tunes as ""Isolation"", so devastating, so stark, so real. Or ""Love""- truly one of the most simple, eloquent songs on the subject ever written. Listen on, it CANNOT come more highly recomended."
4,John Lennon's primal scream,"John Lennon opens his soul (and often his lungs) in his groundbreaking first solo album. Joined by Ringo, Jim Keltner, and Klaus Voormann (Yoko is credited as ""Wind""), the instrumentation is incredibly simple, but the words and the messages pack a punch. Primal therapy in San Francisco released John's demons; he grieves over his mother's death and his father's abandonment, and sings ""I don't believe in Beatles"", yet most of the songs seem to indicate he's unsure of his new life. I haven't described any of the songs individually because there's a ""story"" behind each of them; so just make yourself comfortable and give a listen."
5,Works,It does what it is suppose to do. So far i have had no problems with it. So that is all I have to say about this product.
4,Los mahlerianos podemos estar tranquilos.,"QuÃ© grata satisfacciÃ³n al oÃ­r esta nueva versiÃ³n de la colosal Tercera SinfonÃ­a de Gustav Mahler, por el joven director Esa-Pekka Salonen. Muy bien lograda la interpretaciÃ³n, especialmente en el Ãºltimo movimiento (Adagio), Salonen nos da esa profundidad de la obra de Mahler como corresponde, de tal manera que cuando llegan los timbales finales, estamos completamente extasiados. Los Angeles SO, responde muy noblemente. Estoy seguro que en Salonen tenemos a gran interprete de nuestro querido Mahler y que nos seguirÃ¡ dando muchas gratas sorpresas.Personalmente mi versiÃ³n favorita de Ã©sta SinfonÃ­a es Bernstein (Sony)."
1,A Nice Imitation But Not The Real Thing,"As Mahler gets recorded again and again the newer performances get duller and duller. The passion and sympathy of a Bernstein, Schuricht, Horenstein or Mitropoulos (to name but a few) becomes an even more distant memory. Techincally Salonen has his orchestra well drilled but the passion he puts into his efforts sadly come over as a mere facde. The rather opaque recording made in the Chandler Pavilliondoes little to help matters. With so many other finer performances available for less this present issue is hardly viable."
2,Price is not the best way to choose a text,"As a college instructor, I try to choose texts based on quality, but with consideration of price. I thought this book was a good compromise, but wish I had kept my previous text. This has way too many errors for a 2nd edition, and has received considerable critisism from my students for being hard to follow. There are better choices out there."
1,Not a good textbook at all,I have never read a book as poor as this one ever. It does not go into great detail at all about any topics. Example problems are VERY hard to follow. Some of the answers in the back do not correspond with the actual question being asked. Overall a horrible book. Do not recommend at all.
1,samlar,Got second 5800 from amazon today after the first one would only blink the ready light at me and had parts loose inside. Second unit same thing to start with the ready light blink all the time and per micortek site to fix this unplug and then replug unit.Did this many times on first unit no help on second unit it did start working after unpluging and repluging many times. Know it slows down xp starting so much that it takes forever to do anything on the computer unless I unplug the USB from the sanner. Also turned the unit off again and had the same problem of blinking ready light. Sent Microtek email but do not expect anything until monday not sure I will keep it one way another.I do not trust the unit anymore. Also do not like the statement at Microtek site that they charge 40 dollars if you send one back still under warranity if there tech does not find anything.Think I will go to hp unit.
1,Scanmaker 5800,"Really can't say much except that it would lock up my XP computer. Contacted Microtek by e-mail, got no response.Returned it to Amazon."
1,Very disappointed,"This was put together with very old, blurred photos. It is not a travel DVD, but a cooking DVD, but even the cooking is dated and unlike anything I have ever eaten in northern Italy. If I had known what was on this DVD, I would never have purchased it. There are much better travel DVDs available."
5,Best on the market!,These are the largest and thickest clothes of this kind! I used these in the hospital as a nurse and used them last year when I had to wear an orthopedic boot on my ankle for 6 weeks. We also use them with my Mother for incontinence care. Now I sometimes use them if I don't feel like taking a shower in the morning. They make you feel really clean and refreshed. And they are excellent to take camping! You really feel like you've just bathed or showered.
2,Allergic reaction,"I had a strong allergic reaction to the use of this product. Maybe it wouldn't affect everyone this way, but I suggest being cautious about purchasing these ""cloths"" for bathing. The cost to return them is prohibitive because they weigh a lot, so I'll be throwing them away. It has taken a very long time to recover from the itching."
1,Don't Bother,"Dance, Girl, DanceI am a big fan of Maureen O'Hara, but this movie was not the vehicle for her talent. The story is so weak, you have to think about it before you realize there is one at all.The one and only possible interest is seeing Lucille Ball as a young actress before comedy became her trademark."
5,Wanna sleep on a cloud?,"This is a wonderful addition to my bed. I previously had a memory foam topper on my bed and it does not match the dreamy comfort that this feather bed gives me. I have trouble sleeping and try to make my bed as comfortable and inviting as possible, this feather bed certainly does both for me! The billowed sections actually work, so the fluffiness is consistant across my bed. It stays in place surprisingly well. I have already had several friends try it out and they all are getting one in the next few weeks."
4,A must read book!,"This book is an excellent portrait of humans being self-centered. Using a historic event, the author adds a fictional character into the story and conveys the theme. This book is for all ages, and especially for people that likes African-American literature."
2,Bleak,"Yes, I know Proulx is an award winning author, but she just doesn't do it for me. POSTCARDS traces the lives of the Blood family, which early on becomes known mostly through postcards sent to each other. Eldest son Loyal leaves home in the mid-forties after accidentally killing his girlfriend. For 40 or 50 years he writes postcards to the family left behind, never with a return address. They can never let him know of the tragedies that befall the family, and the family never knows the real reason Loyal left home. Before this book I'd read Proulx's CLOSE RANGE, Wyoming Stories. I liked two stories in that book. THE BLOOD BAY, and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. Even with BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, the movie was better than the story. This is something I seldom find to be true of any literary work that is made into a movie. Proulx is a very ""descriptive"" writer. A lot of people love her...I am not one of them."
4,Just taste what you want; you don't have to clean your plate,"As much as I loved -- I mean, really, really loved -- The Shipping News -- I found it impossible to completely read Postcards. The first chapters were fascinating. Then about halfway, I started to lose interest. So I decided to browse it like a volume of short stories. The book is perfectly named, to describe what it is. Little pockets of stories. If you get bored with one, you can always just move on to the next one, or the one after that. That's what several of the characters did, so I gave myself permission to do likewise.A search of Google maps shows that there really is a place called Cream Hill, in western Vermont. It probably is every bit as hideous in winter as Proulx describes it to be. Nobody writes descriptive prose like her. You really feel like you are there.The character of Jewell, she is someone that I ached to know better. I'd love to read an entire book from her point of view."
2,A Tough Read,"After reading the book, I looked at all the customer reviews, and thought it was interesting that the one reviewer said something to the effect that the less articulate among us seemed to have liked it less. Well, I didn't like it,and I think I am fairly articulate. I appreciate the high command of the English language that Annie Proulx seems to have. In some passages, she is brilliant and evokes strong feelings (usually of darkness and unhappiness). She can create a scene like few others, but her books (and I've read all of them) don't come together smoothly for me. I had to try too hard to really enjoy this one. I don't deny her talent, she has won the Pulitzer Prize and got nominated for the National Book Award this year, but I dont think think I will ever waste my time with another one of her books. There are too many other fine reads out there that don't leave you feeling like you are going to fail the class because you didn't ""get"" the material."
2,"Family saga, dysfunctional, depressing","I loved Shipping News. I can't make it to the end of Postcards. Everytime I pick it up and read a few pages I begin to think ""Where is Prozac when you really need it."" Sorry. Just too depressing. I know she lays words next to each other with the precision of a skilled bricklayer with a pile of mismatched stones, but then all you get is a mismatched wall that makes your heart ache every time you look at it."
2,well written - hopelessly depressing,"I stumbled upon Post Cards while looking up Pen Faulkner award winners. I was very supprised to find this book listed here. The book starts our with a rape-muder and goes downhill from there. The main charater ends up as an old vagrant after a series of adventures. Life is hardly better for her other charaters. I find Ms Proulx to be a very accomplished writer and thoroughly enjoyed ""Shipping News"". It is a shame she had to waste her talents creating this saga of the Blood Family. In fact her skill as a writer makes the story more wretched. I can't help but wonder what Neurosis Ms. Proulx suffered from that enabled her to create this tale. If you are feeling guilty about having a good life and want to be punished, read this book."
1,tbcaudle,"I thought that I would never finish reading this book. That is how riveting it is. Postcards was tedious and bleak. I would read a few pages and put it down for months. I had to force myself to read it because I do not like to leave things unfinished, no matter how mundane the story. I had hoped that the story would become interesting.I agree with the reviewer that gave this book 1 star for its burn value. I give it 1 star because, unfortunatley, that is a low as you can go in order to give a review.I highly recommend the Shipping News, also by Prouxl, because at least it leaves you with a glimmer of hope for the characters.However, leave this one on the shelf, let it collect dust, unless you want to be deeply depressed or at best, put to sleep."
2,Not so Merry,"I have always enjoyed the adventures of Hamish Macbeth. However, I was very disappointed in this particular one. The story is extremely short without much plot or character development. It appears that M.C. Beaton wrote it quickly, perhaps in order to meet a deadline for Christmas publication. It also appears to have been printed in haste since there were myriad typographical errors. I am anxious to read the next book in this series to regain the delight I've always felt in the Hamish Macbeth tales."
1,Just awful!,"This book was a real disappointment- got the feeling Beaton really didnt want to write it and rushed through. No murder, very uninteresting crime and no insight into criminals at all. If this was my first MC Beaton book Id never pick up another!Makes my Top Ten List of Lousy Books."
4,Not so Silent Night!,"M.C. Beaton's Hamish Macbeth series takes a holiday in ""A Highland Christmas""!And for her fans, naturally, it's a good read: full of the Christmas spirit in everyway, from the local Grinches, Scrooges, and other no-good-niks, to Lockdubh's own angels with their own Spirits of Christmas presents! It's full of holiday cheer and joy, to offset the negative side of the season.Someone has stolen the Christmas lights! The villagers are in an uproar and naturally our Hamish, the local bobby of Lochdubh, is called upon to solve the crime. The book is a ""feel good"" read, rather short, but still it holds the interest of Ms Beaton's fans. Naturally, Hamish has ANOTHER love interest. Will it be a lasting one?So--deck the halls with boughs of holly, trim the tree, pour a delicous glass of pure Highland malt (neat, of course), and be prepared for a nice read. Happy Hols!"
4,CELEBRATING THE HOLIDAYS WITH HAMISH MACBETH...,"In this, the sixteenth book in a delightful series of cozy mysteries, the author returns to those elements that makes this series so addictive. It should be noted, however, that the book is decidedly shorter in length than usual, and the type face used is much larger. Even with the larger typeface, the story runs only about one hundred in thirty one pages, almost more of a novella than a novel.That being said, this slim tome is an enjoyable read, despite the fact that there are no murders involved. Instead, the mystery involves a relatively minor crime, but this slight change in the author's formula does not serve to mar the reader's enjoyment of this book. The author serves up a heartwarming holiday tale of village life in northern Scotland with our lovable Highlander, Constable Hamish Macbeth, at its heart."
4,"Awesome, creepy","The acting, imaging of this movie is great as is the story line. It is full of sexual tension and realism."
2,Boys Life 6 - Not worth my time,I really don't know why I continue to buy the boys life series. Allot of the short films a really not worth my time or the money I put in for the DVD.
4,I loved it!,"I happened upon this book at a charity book fair and bought it because my daughter's name is Chloe. I can't wait to read Loving Chloe! Coincidentally, we are going to be in the Cameron, Arizona area this spring. Thanks, Jo-Ann, for making your Chloe a character that I can share (someday!) with my Chloe."
4,Good read,Only parts I didn't like were about dying horses!11 more words required in order to post my rating? I want quick ratings amazon
1,cheap & ugly,i wish i could do 0 stars... it is cheap and looks like it is already tarnishing...... it is not shiny like in the pictures ... and i tryed to contact the seller and THEY NEVER CONTACTED ME BACK..... dont buy product or from this seller
4,A good gift for those not from the US,"I gave this book and Better Homes and Garden Cookbook to my sister-in-law living in Pakistan. She wanted to learn some ""basic"" American cooking, or I should say the ""melting pot"" cooking we have. She enjoys them both as do I . . . I seem to collect a lot of cookbooks -- but when asked by her to send some reflecting American cooking these were the two I chose."
5,Betty Crocker New Cookbook,"If your kids are going out on their own - but them this one book. They will need to eat someday, and this cookbook has pictures! And my son didn't eat the pages!"
3,more kat for the buck,"If you would like a better deal on some classic Felix from the 20s- early 30s, look up DVDs ""felix woos whoopie"" & ""felix the cat vol 1"", both offered for only a couple dollars. With those 2 discs you would have 15 episodes, all great ones. Im just sayin, thats all"
2,"This is EARLY stuff, sound = ORGAN ONLY, but imaginative","Being a casual fan of Felix, this disc isn't what I was expecting. It appears to contain the ""birth"" of Felix--B&W shorts from before he even had a name. But still, somehow, despite the constant Wurlitzer accompanyment and occasional non-PC material, Felix is still funny. His tail is an extremely useful, detachable, and sentient appendage. Picture quality is bad--obviously transfered from old OLD film."
5,It really works...,"I bought these to try on my feet as suggested, bu have been using them on the back of my neck/shoulder area. I have a thick raised area there and my neck pivots forward a bit from there. So I put pads there for 6 nites so far...the ""bump"" is receding, and I have less stress related pain there; the pads come off dark grey to black."
5,This band can really play music,"If you've seen them live you know this album doesn't make any justice to their talent as musicians. ""Tiempo"" and ""Dos dÃ­as en la vida"" are my favorites, but there are many other interesting tracks such as ""Completo incompleto"" or ""MamÃ¡"" (amazing blues/flamenco).By the way, Pau is such an interesting person, I'm glad to say I had the chance to interview him a few months ago and he's really a nice, intelligent guy.And correcting the guy from San Francisco, Jarabe is not a Mexican band (I wish they were!), they're Spanish."
4,Scary and Excellent Book for Older Kids,"I borrowed this book from the library a few days before Halloween when one of my kids was home sick from school. Some parts were so scary he asked me to sing in an operatic voice so it would seem less so. Upon finishing it he said, ""Go get the next one tomorrow!"" It was really quite good, and even I wanted to sneak a peak to see what was going to happen next. The only downside was that I couldn't read it immediately before bedtime because of the fear-factor."
5,Must Read New Series,The Last Apprentice was an easy read but the characters were enthralling and I was sorry to see the last page of the book come. Can't wait for the second book in the series. This is one that I will be lending to my son!
4,Good book,I started by reading the first trial chapter and it just hooked me in. im off to grab the next book in the series on my kindle fire hd
2,"Wonderful writing, but distrubingly misogynistic","I have only read the first book in this series (Revenge of the Witch) and so do not know if the not so subtle misogyny works itself out in later books in a more hopeful and nuanced way. While the writing is wonderful, the plot gripping, it would be unfortunate if young men (or women) were to read this book without an attendant history lesson from their parents. My 10 year old read picked it up but I read it first, then my 14 year old. We talked about how the book portrays women as at best mysterious and often evil, with male characters only stupid and manipulated rather than evil, or the heroes of the tale. Again, I'm hopeful that later books in the series do something to explain why it's only female witches that need to be locked in a hole in the ground as a ""charitable"" alternative to being burned at the stake. The book's writing and plot deserve five stars but as a book for children, its rating needs downgrading."
2,no novelist he,"Professors are not novelists. As accurate as this book might be, the writing is quite poor. It drags and there is very little plot, just a string of events. I'm sure he was a fine scholar."
5,Coup doesn't dissappoint,Once again The Coup comes out wit an album that will not stop. All around fantastic. How can the coup not be one of the most highly regarded and listened too hip hop groups? Maybe their message makes too many people think a little too hard.
4,I tried this product for a week and ...,"I tried this product for a week and at first I thought it would give volume to my hair. It did give my hair a soft non-bristly feeling but didn't leave it feeling full of body. Although I like the product, it just didn't do exactly what I thought it would do. It gives my hair a clean sheen and doesn't leave it greasy like some conditioners. I'd recommend this product to others to use, depending on what they're looking for."
1,It Definitely Does Not Follow,"Ariano is just so full of herself. My first whiff of this book was strangely reminiscent of Drew Barrymore's equally whiny ""Little Girl Lost."" The difference is that, despite still having wild child tendencies (even now at age 30), Barrymore actually demonstrated that she could learn and evolve. Ariano (aka Wing Chun) has failed on all fronts.Having been a teenager of the 1980s, I find it impossible to sympathize. I encountered a level of brutality and ostracism that would blow her mind. (Even Revenge of the Nerds was a better example of 1980s misfit youth life.) I also find it hard to be anything other than bored or annoyed at her mindset.""A Bad Teen Novel"" is a mild way to put it. If you have a copy, burn it or shred it or get your money back. A minus five-star rating is the mildest way to go."
2,Half-baked,"I get the reverence some have for the seminal punk band, The Ramones, without whom this would be a truly awful flick. Still, that's not quite enough to salvage this Roger Corman vehicle. Bad acting, lame script, cliched plot and forced laughs are what we see here. Somehow, this has acquired cult status. And there are a suitcase full of extras with many of the cast and crew congratulating themselves on having made it. In reality, this story had been done better before, and much much better since this came out in 1980. Three of the four Ramones are now gone, and this was their only film appearance, aside from documentaries. So, if you liked them - and I did not especially - then watch this for the music history. They were really weird people to look at. Maybe it's better if you're stoned, too."
1,"This is a joke, right?","The characters are shallow and not believeable. Dialog is trite, and the plot is thin and slow. Griffin spends way too much time on irrelevant detail.I felt like I was reading a soap opera adaptation. First and last WEB Griffin book I'll read."
4,Classic R & B from the falsetto prototype of the era,"One of the finest voices as a member of the tempting Temptations, Eddie began his solo career in the early 70s and recorded some terrific tunes like ""Keep On Truckin,"" ""Boogie Down"" and ""Shoeshine Boy."" On this compilation we get those hits plus a couple of tunes that are hard to find on a domestic CD. The real find is the final track, his reunion at the Apollo Theater with fellow Temptation David Ruffin (backed by Hall & Oates) from the mid 80s. This tune has been out of print forever. Worth the price of the CD. Order this one today."
2,Not much power for the price,"This is the ""starter"" battery that Sony provided with camcorders, but their higher power batteries are better values. For example, the NP-F770 cost only 11% more but gives 383% more power.It's not that this is a bad battery, but it's expensive for a battery of such little strength. Either buy a generic one for 1/3 the price, or buy a better Sony battery for slightly more money."
2,"Worked at first but now, not compatible with camcorder.","Hey guys, I received the battery pretty quickly (thanks for that) the only issue is the battery worked up until today just fine. I just turned the camcorder on today to take some footage of planes at my local airport and an error flashed on my screen ""For InfoLITHIUM Battery ONLY"" and then the camera shut off. It repeated numerous times and I even tried recharging the battery again, which when you do that the empty battery display just flashes on the screen. This was listed as a Sony product, but like others have said it isn't."
3,It's a Hoot!,This is highway driving music for me. I love cranking it up while I tool down the road. It's also a pick-me-up. Annoyed by the guy in the car next to you playing obnoxious noise that passes for music? Blast him back with this classical baby.
4,A zany time is had by all!,"The advantage this has over the original cast album is that you get a majority of the dialogue on this to really give you a picture of the whole show without having seen it (and I didn't see this production, since I was born five years later). The disadvantage is the reduced orchestrations, but since Hershy Kay did the charts for both shows he keeps the flavor in these. And the overture, which is half the reason to listen to this show, still sounds excellent. This version of the show is certainly more focused than the 1956 original, but it's still disjointed. For a wild time with a beautiful score, though, I recommend it."
4,What Candide should be,"Listening to this cast recording was a more pleasurable experience than sitting throught the boring and labored 1997 revival on Broadway. Yes, it's over the top but it should be. The singers sound like musical theater singers instead of overblown opera. You lose a little with the reduced orchestrations, but it has a style and a pace that I don't hear on the other recordings. I could have done without so much dialogue, but it definitely worth the purchase."
4,Truly Funny Silent Comedy,"Steamboat Bill (Ernest Torrence) is in competition with another local riverboat man (Tom McGuire). Aside from his problems at home, his son (Buster Keaton) is coming home from college. Bill Jr. is a bit of a klutz and besides causing trouble that way, he's in love with the rival boatman's daughter (Marion Byron). Because of his son, Bill lands in jail in the midst of a wild storm.Steamboat Bill, Jr. features some of the most well known stunts of Keaton's career including the scene where the house falls down on him and he's in the window looking around. The storm scene is one of the best parts of the film. It features many impressive stunts and lots of action as well as comedy. However, Keaton does not only excell in outrageous scenes. The bit in the jailhouse is subtley hilarious."
4,well...,"i've read all of garwoods books, in fact she's the reason i started reading romance novels books. i just finished 'come the spring' last night and unlike everyone else it was my favorite in the clayborne series. i have to say however, that the series over all were my least favorite books written (not teriible though). if you like romance, check out garwoods' "" the wedding"" and ""the bride"". they're probably my favorite romance novels to date."
2,Not like her at all,"Usually Julie Garwood makes you laugh and warms your heart. She delved into the arena of thriller as early as ""Castles"" and came along nicely with it in the opening of ""Come the Spring"". Sadly, she seemed to forget how to write her humorous and charming relationships along the way.Trying to do a dual romance in this novel was a mistake. Time was taken away from both relationships such that one loses interest in either one. That leads a lacking dramatic finale because you just don't care.The writing appeared exceptionally juvenile in places where humor was intended.It was a nice try and I applaud an author wanting to grow her talent, but this Clayborne series never should have left the editor's desk. ""Come the spring"" was half-baked at best."
5,Wonderful,"This was great. I loved Cole. The plot was cool. I wish it had more about the other kids, I'd like to know what happened to Travis and Emily, but Cole is still one of my favorite characters. I loved Jessica, she was perfect for him. This is a great book. I suggest you read it for yourself."
4,Best Claybourne Story YET!!!,Of all the books in this series this is the best!! The dynamics between Cole and Ryan are awesome!! It's like you get two for the price of one! They are both such good strong characters. The romances that brew between Cole and Jessica and Ryan and Grace are wonderful!!! They are heartwarming and touching. I also loved the mystery behind the crimes in the book. It's a definate read!
2,Not up to Julie Garwood's usual standard.,"If another author wrote 'Come the Spring' I would think this was a fairly okay novel. However, I have come to expect something very special from Julie Garwood, and as such was very disappointed. Usually, I am unable to put her stories down until finished. It took me a week to finish this one. As there were two concurrent romances described, the reader only got to know the characters fairly superficially. The warmth and humour that is Julie Garwood's trademark was missing. The background to the novel did not capture my imagination - it was a little violent and appeared out of character for the author. Please Ms Garwood, take us back to the Highlands!"
5,Whistle for safety,"Kwik Tek W-2 Whistle With Lanyard (Red / Black)This whistle is LOUD! My son is on a search and rescue team and needs this item when he makes a ""find"". It lets other team members know where to find him, so they can help with the rescue. He loved this whistle when I bought it for him. It's a great product. No problems with it. But as a side note, don't feed it to the lawn mower, becuase it is NOT lawn mower proof!! *(Yes, I'm ordering another one now!)"
1,Does not work well when wet.,"Well, I thought this whistle was designed to work in the event of an emergency in the water. So, the first thing I did when I opened the package, was I submersed the whistle in water. Alas, hardly a sound emerged. It was definitely not audible enough to alert anyone--which was the whole point of purchasing the whistle. Don't waste your money."
3,Stingy collection of songs,"All of the songs on this collection are great--not a lemon in the bunch. But with only 52 minutes of music, it's an inadequate offering. There is so much else that could have been added including: Get Down To It, Honky Tonk Woman, I Can't Stand the Rain, 99 Pounds, Road Runner, Good Booze and Bad Women, Every Single Day, The Fixer, Anna and many others. Also, the 20 second introduction to I Don't Need No Doctor was chopped off."
5,Life-saving information,"When I was diagnosed with diabetes several years ago, I read Dr. Trattlers book and it simply changed my life. My blood sugars plummmeted downwards and I lost 80 lbs. in the process.It has since become my health bible and I recommend it to everyone!The food and nutritional information is invaluable and his analysis of diseases ,with their causes and symptoms is unsurpassed.The natural alternatives are not only life-changing but in my opinion-life-saving.I have referred to and reread this book over and over again through the years and I thank Dr. Trattler for his ""gift"" of health to me."
3,Blueprint for ...?,"There is difficult to read Moses Israel Finley's book about Politics in Ancient world, somehow. It could misslead to compare our present days with forgotten past. What was going about, what they took into account ? Perhaps basically they have not a clue , and they took the best girl on the beach as well as the best cabin boy when on the board. And when they got it they drunk (didn't smoke pot) and boast each other among goodfellows ,and tried prevent others from stabing them to back as they did to those who preceeded them in the queue. But they sometimes made about it nice oratory , not just propaganda- 20min WMD deployment or Empire of evil, now you can just text to Wikileaks. Interesting how they strugled with public corruption and abuse of office. A.Andrewes book The Greek Tyrrans is easier to read to this one. Illuminating for every White house intern."
3,call me a sissy but i cried,after having finished ff8 i had to get thiss song so i could relive the splendor of it and if faye wong is reading this i love ur voice.
5,Just amazing as the game itself,"I'm not going to write too long cuz the music is enough beutiful itself that doesn't require any admirer... ""Eyes on me"" is one of my most favorites musics Ive ever heard so far with lots of emotions senses romance & ... that even brings tear sometimes to my eyes ^.^aJust get this music & listen to it & youll be addicted to it like me 8)Enjoy"
4,Great Song!!,"I have not actually bought this cd yet,but I have the game Final Fantasy VIII and just loved this song when i heard it. She has a beautiful voice with a unique style. I reccomend this cd to anyone. :)"
2,There are better books,"Miss Benedict may have been a good scholar, but she could have done better with her treaty on the culture of Japan. Mostly long winded to get her point across. And only quotes once briefly from Dr. Nitobe, of whom she could have gained great insite from. I suggest reading the works of Japanese authors, or at least those who have been to Japan and have lived within it's culture."
2,"Other books are much better, authors went to Japan.","This is an out of date look at the Japanese. Ruth Benedict interviewed Japanese in the United States during the last years of World War II. After the war Benedict had a chance to visit Japan and talk to Japanese in Japan, but elected not to do so. Therefore, this book is jaded and misrepresents the Japanese. Other books are better and give a truer picture of the Japanese."
4,Nice Trumpet Stand,"This is a very nice, stable trumpet stand. It's compact and can fit in a trumpet case. Another nice thing about it is that it's made in Germany."
5,Great trumpet stand!,"I wanted a trumpet stand to hold my trumpet when attending practice sessions with my organizations. It is handy to keep by my chair and hold my horn while selecting music.I would recommend it to any trumpet player to help prevent the instrument from slipping from your lap while attending to music, etc."
4,Pool book,Good book for those pool players who are looking to improve the game on the tactical and mental side.
1,no audio!,"none. Noticed with panasonic viera have to return, load again for some movies, only had trouble with a couple of old movies so far. Two so far no audio at all. New TV. Newer mac desk top, ethernet to TV."
2,Not sure about 2nd copy,"My first DVD froze and skipped during the Liquidation of the Ghetto. I just received a replacement copy from Amazon (thanks for the speedy delivery). Watched it and it all seems okay. But I'm not sure. During the exact same spot where the first DVD froze and skipped, it doesn't do it now. However, it freezes for 2-3 seconds before continuing. Is this right? Could it be because the DVD was shifting to the 2nd layer? And there's another question. Is this a double-layer, double-sided disc? Great movie, but disappointing production. Another case of trying to get the most profit from the least input?"
4,Schindler's List,I think this movie is well made and gives the viewer a good understanding as to what the death camps were like. Even though a movie can never fully make the viewers feel the pain fear and loss these people suffered it comes close. In all I feel the movie is well done.
1,Bad CD,"The cd i received is either damaged or boot legged in the middle of the movie it freezes up , i will not be buying from Amazon again."
3,"Great Movie, Substandard Presentation Case","The movie is, obviously, moving and powerful. Nobody should doubt that the movie itself is other than exceptional. However, the ""special edition"" features are laughable and are hardly worth the extra money. First of all, Spielberg makes no commentary. How can the director of a movie of such epic proportions remain silent? Secondly, the ""plexiglass"" display case is cheap and shoddy. I have seen three of them so far and all of them have multiple cracks in various places that were not, obviously, the result of mishandling in shipment.Save the money and buy the normal version."
1,Flipper...? Shame on you $pielberg,"I can't believe he'd do this. If I even thought there was still a chance that some directer's would allow a flipper, I would not have opened the package to this one, so I could have returned it.One of the best movies ever though.Now I have to go write him a letter insisting on a Special Edition with a $19 rebate offer for people who were suckered into this version. :(Rent this one, unless you want to own a type of DVD that was phased out years ago."
2,Not at all funny,"This movie is not even the slightest bit funny. When I saw that Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes were teaming up under the comic tutelage of Steven Spielberg, I must say that my hopes were high. It falls flat. The comedy is forced and tired and just not funny. Sure, I might have smirked once or twice, but mostly this is just not funny stuff. It's just not funny. If you want funny, I would suggest Richard Pryor movies or maybe ""Bachelor Party"" starring Tom Hanks before he started making unfunny movies too. I did like the black and white part about it though. That was kind of funny, but not ha ha funny."
5,Schindlers List and Saving Private Ryan are Spielbergs best!,This was a great movie. Schindlers List And Saving Private Ryan are director Steven Spielbergs best. These movies have the best acting that I have ever seen. Both storys take place in World War 2. I own Saving Private Ryan On DVD. Now I need Schindlers List out on DVD to set beside The Private Ryan DVD in my collection.
5,Lest we forget...,"Thought provoking and heart rending and much deserving of the Best Picture Academy award.Its also a film I could only watch through once, so real was its depiction of death and the cheapness of life in those horrible conditions and during that terrible time. The grainy b/w film with splashes of red also made a visual impact that was unexpected.Let us not forget and... ...No sequels ...please."
4,GREAT MOVIE BUT PURE FICTION,"AS MOST I WATCHED THIS MOVIE AND SHED A TEAR.......... BUT AS I READ UP ON WW2 AND SCHINDLER , I FOUND OUT THE MOVIE WAS PURE FICTION.IT IS AN AMAZING MOVIE, BUT IT IS NOT CLOSE TO FACT IN ANYWAY, AND HOPE PEOPLE WHO WATCH IT OR WATCHED IT RESEARCH IT AND FIND OUT THE TRUTH ABOUT THE STORY.I AM NO RACIST , NO LOON JUST A WW2 BUFF . AND AFTER WATCHING THIS MOVIE MAYBE 10 TIMES I RESEARCHED SCHINDLER AND THE MOVIE AND FOUND OUT IT WAS FICTION. SURE THE NAZIS DID SOME OF THAT STUFF, BUT THE MOVIE GOES OVER THE TOP AND IS PROPOGANDA AGAINST GERMAN PEOPLE.MY 4 NEPHEWS ARE JEWISH AND I WILL BE SURE TO LET THEM WATCH IT AND MAKE SURE THEY KNOW ITS FICTION AND LET THEM RESEARCH IT THEMSELVES.BUT AS A MOVIE IT IS A GREAT PEICE OF FICTION, JUST FELT LET DOWN AFTER 5 OR SO YEARS OF BELEIVING THE STORY THAT IS WAS MADE UP.RESEARCH THE SUBJECT BEFORE U CALL ME NAMES OR MAKE UNEDUCATED STATEMENTS.TY"
5,"Five, Ten, Fifty Stars Can't Do This Movie Justice!!!!","Truly one of the true cinematic achievements of the decade, if not the century. To those who gave it one star, and especially to the person who said ""go watch your dog sleep instead,"" I must ask if you actually watched this movie. A brilliant testament to the horror that was the Holocaust. May we never forget."
5,History Take Back,"I have seen this movie a few times, however I purchased and watched this movie with my teenage children to have them see the atrosities of mankind history, it had the effect on them that I had hoped for, a true understanding of why this was wrong and why we as humans must ensure that this doesn't ever happen again."
2,Bad excuse for a DVD edition,"Everyone already knows how great and critically acclaimed this film is so this is a review of the DVD. This will probably go down as one of the biggest let-downs (for me) in DVD anticipations. Sure you have the widescreen version with great sound on DVD, but thats it. For People who already have the VHS versions, you pay more money for a little better picture and sound and you get cheated on features. Instead of a great commentary or documentary you get more preachy propaganda Spielburg dumped onto the second side of the disc. I have a feeling that Spielburg wanted the film to be the highlight of the DVD and not the extras, but in my opinion, extras never hurt...especially if your going to price it like it has tons of extras on it. If you want to be emotionally, or spiritually moved watch the movie, you don't really need to see the lousy extras. My advice is to only buy the widescreen DVD verion if you don't already have it in VHS."
1,confussed,"ok the film gets 5 stars, its spielburgs best film but wot the f*k is with the dvd. im sorry but i believe lord of the ring the return of the king was on one dvd, but this is just as long as it and its black and white!!! so why cant this be put on one dvd. shamfull!"
2,Terrible Black and white film,"The film itself is good. But I really do not understand why it is filmed in black and white. The 1939 to 1945's world is not a black and white world, it is a colored world instead. This black and white film looks like a documentary (WORLD AT WAR) which greatly reduced my interest in seeing it no matter how good its content is. If the film is colored, the German solders's uniform and other people's dressing or coat will be very attractive and beautiful look, and the film will be rated 5 stars."
2,Frustrating Interruption,"The critics are right. The case is cardboard, most shocking because it won't hold up over time. The critics are also right about the break in the film.The break is at a critical point in the film and the interruption is extremely frustrating. So what, its a flipper, I can live with this, but the breaking point that was chosen really is terrible.More whining, maybe, but everyone have a valid point - this DVD definitely could have been done better.5 star film. Presentation 2."
1,It is insane!!,How can this film NOT be on blu ray? What is the studio waiting for? Let's hope they get the message soon.
3,"Sorry, but here comes the critical review!","Overall the movie was filmed wonderfully, the cast was well picked, and scenes were shot with care. The problem is that this could have easily been a 2 hour film. The premise at the beginning of the film was interesting, but seeing so many people shot in so many different ways was very tiresome. I got the point after the first few shootings and then it seemed like I was watching an overly done mafia movie. Once I slipped in the second tape, the film became much more emotionally stirring. This is where the tears started flowing. I cried about three or four times and let my sensitive side go. This film is worth seeing. Next time I see it, the ol' fast forward button will be in high gear on the first tape.Joe Dorsey"
2,Manufacturer Error,"This is a wonderful movie, one of the best made, but the DVD has some problems. This first copy I bought froze up towards the end of chapter 16. I returned this copy and received another one which happens to freeze in the exact same spot. Neither copy had any surface scratches. Has anyone else noticed this problem?"
3,why do we have to turn over,"what a great movie A1 sound and picture but why ruin it by having to turn it over, for goodness sake this is a DVD not a Laser disc. I can't believe it!"
5,Great Movie that teaches a powerful lesson to mankind.,"""Schindlers List"" was one of the most emotional movie i have ever seen. The way that the inhumane Nazis terrified the Jews and murdered them without a reson. And Oscar Schindler is a good example of a hero, to have sacraficed so much to sve so little compared to the 6 million who perished under the Nazi rule."
5,A Most Powerful Movie,"How can I describe this movie? Intense, horrifing, heartbreaking, incredible. This movie is all of these and more. The movie portrays Oskar Schindler, a German capitalist who takes advantage of the Nazi's use of Jews as slave labor. As the movie progresses we see Schindler (portrayed wonderfully by Liam Neeson) begin to see the evil all around him and his determination to do anything he can to save his workers. This movie does not cut anything-we are forced to watch the horrors the Nazi's performed on the Jews. Ralph Finnes as the horrible Nazi Amon Geth should have won the Oscar he was nominated for. If you have not seen this picture rent it, buy it, or borrow it. But definitely see it!"
3,OK,"My son likes the PR products however he likes the ones that change into dragons or something rather than these set figures. The racer is cool, but he gravitates to the morphing ones more."
2,it smells like crap,i rather use durex.. durex seems overall thinner than trojans... and they don't smell as bad
5,All that I can say about Beloved is AMEN,"I also highly recommend ""No Restrictions"" if this is your first time listening to David."
5,Very classy!,"I love, love, love these glasses. They are simple and classic and the heavy bottom makes them hard to tip over. I would highly recommend these and everything else from the Luigi Bormioli Michelangelo line."
1,DOES'NT WORK!!!!!,IT DIDNT MAKE A NOISEi THOUGHT IT WOULD WORK BUT IT DIDNT I DO NOT GET HOW THE OTHER PEOPLE GOT IT TO WORK I CAN GET IT TO WORK WITH AN AIR COMMPRESSOR AND A CENTERAL VAC
5,Witness to others!!,That is what this book made me want to do. I wanted to drive to the mall and just start talking to people about Christ. The story premise for this book was a great idea. I was challenged and excited. MUST READ for all Christians!
3,Not at all what I was expecting,"When I picked up this book, I didn't actually realize that it was a fictional narrative. I expected more like a practical, self-help book. The storyline is quite simple and takes place mostly over the course of one day. Sam hears a sermon about 'listening to others' and that night, he has a dream which turns out to be a prophetic vision. God has opened his heart and now he can hear the deepest desires, feelings and yearnings of those around him though they are not expressed verbally. The first scene occurs when he goes to a coffee shop and finds himself responding to what he assumes people are ""saying"" although in actuality they're not talking. Unfortunately, I had a hard time getting past the way it reminded me of that Mel Gibson movie, ""What women want."" Nonetheless, it's a moving story of the ways in which we fail to hear and respond to our neighbors and how everyone HAS these deep desires in their hearts which are unspoken."
3,This is Rave vol. 3,"Rave is awesome, but This is Rave, Vol. 1 is definitely better than vol 3, so if you are looking for good rave and do not have any of the volumes, start with vol 1."
3,"Good for the Beginner, okay for everybody else","I read Brew Chem 101 in one day. It's an easy read and not too technical. Chapter 3, ""Yeast and Fermentation"" is a good explanation of how different strains of yeast work and the general environment needed for good yeast growth. Chapter 5, ""Understanding and Avoiding Off Flavors"" is the goldmine of the book. Not only does Lee W. Jason, Ph.D. explain the taste or smell, he explains the technical cause and methods for avoiding each flavor. The beginner should check this book out before brewing his next batch. The brewer that's been around the block for a while might find parts of the book interesting too."
5,Childrens Picture Spanish Dictionary,This is a GREAT picture dicionary for ALL ages. I am a college student living in Spain and it has really helped me perfect my spanish. The pictures really help. You must buy this.
2,"lots of facts and details, but dull reading","These books are usually dull and this one is no exception. Now i understand: if writers of private eye novels stuck to the truth and the way it really is no one would buy their books--so they ""improvise."" This thing was written close to 30 years ago. If you're interested in the way it really is, buy it, otherwise forget it. O'Grady name-drops a lot. Dated, etc. I don't regret buying it, though, as I got it used at a discount."
2,Not so great,"I watched this movie because it was filmed mostly in my town, and I know some of the extras. It's always fun to see your friends on the big screen and see familiar sites. But, this movie is too odd. By the main character's name, ""Ida"", I thought this must be taking place in an earlier decade. But it's current by the automobiles. With all the perverts in the world today, what mother would let her daughter go with an old man and a group of strangers out on the road? Besides that, the side stories are many and not completed. It's just not a well written movie. But I thought the actiing was good! I think my adult kids would be totally bored, as would my grandchildren."
4,"Good, not great.","Not as good as book one of the series, still this is a very worthwhile addition to the DS9 storyline and the Star Trek genre in general. Good characterizations, good pacing, fair to middling plot. Unspectacular, but definitely worth reading."
2,Not so poised...,"In comparison to other Poise protection pads I have needed and used for the past three years, Ultra Plus Pads leave much to be desired. While the pads are relatively thick, they offer very poor protection."
2,Warning...,"The box says that the 2nd and 3rd films are extended version. But this is only the case for the 2nd, 3rd is only theatrical cut.But despite this, the films are not expensive, and should delight fans of horror movies."
3,A bit too concise,"This book is concise and tends to speed its way through the topics. The author states that a serious attempt to reduce the size of the book was made and it shows. Topics are covered in theory but not thoroughly explored. If you methodically work your way through the topics, doing every exercise and exploring the topics on your own then the book may be of use to you. If you are looking for a one stop textbook with lots of examples and an exploration of the topic then you probably will find this book deficient. On a positive note however, the Author manages to blend maths and computing quite well and lays a solid foundation for computing."
3,Nothing exceptional,It doesn't look like live plant for sure so if you plan to put it next to a real one it may not look good. Quality and finish is average.
5,My fish love these!,Our two Betta love these plants! they are constantly hanging out inside of them half asleep and looking really peaceful!
5,Received as pictured,"My daughter came home from college few weeks ago with three adopted goldfish. I don't know why. She had kept them in a garbage pail (thoroughly cleaned, she assured me!) I got a proper fish tank at our local pet store but couldn't find any tank accessory that was right. I ordered this 2-pack plant from Amazon.com. I received them exactly as pictured, but they were taller than I expected. (They both reached to the top of the small fish tank.) They sway in the water and don't fall down. The plants are visually appealing to us humans, but more importantly, the little ones seem to enjoy swimming around them. Thanks, Amazon.com! I can always buy what I need from your website!"
5,"Exciting Group, True to the 20's and 30's Genre","The Piccadilly Dance Orchestra has played for British royalty and keeps a full schedule. When you listen to this CD, you will understand why.Putting on the Ritz, Soft Lights and Sweet Music, and I Won't Dance are among my favorites. Not quite as good a selection as some of their other CD's, especially ""Shall We Dance?"" and ""Let's Face the Music and Dance"" (based on my taste), but still great.They play in the musical genre of the 1920's through 40's, but seem to specialize in early 1930's songs -- the types made popular in Fred Astaire movies. Their band is good sized, together, and top notch. All instruments work together and the songs are accompanied by exceptional vocalists. This group does not cut any corners or make any compromises. Top notch, done right."
3,No way the best golf book ever!,"I play a lot of golf and love reading about the glory days of the game. I must say I was disappointed with this book. It's not bad, but given the other reviews I was expecting much more. I guess I am spoiled by the Mark Frost golf books (Greatest Game Ever Played, The Match and Grand Slam)."
2,"Buyer Beware - ""Unplugged"" maybe, but certainly not [LIVE]","Despite...addition of the word [LIVE] to Sun Records' original title, don't be fooled, as I was. With the exception of ""Waiting for a Train"" and ""Hello Stranger"", the tracks on this album were made from the same analog masters used to make _More a Legend Than a Band_. Again, this is an alternate release of old studio material, not a live performance as understood in the ""MTV Unplugged"" sense.So, if you already own _More a Legend Than a Band_, know that you will simply be paying $[money]each for ""Waiting for a Train"" and ""Hello Stranger"".That being said, either _""Unplugged""_ or _More a Legend Than a Band_ is wonderful album, meriting four stars. If you own either, though, the other is worth less than one star."
4,Rabies On Cd,"First i Picked up this item in a 50 cent 7inch section, it was cheap so i got it. I went home and listened to it i wasn't amazed, but i kept listening to it. It is a great EP, its cheap on cd too so go get it!"
5,"My father-in-law, who had a stroke last year, ...","My father-in-law, who had a stroke last year, prefers these to all others. He has the use of only one hand. These are like underwear and he can put them on himself. They're just the right amount of protection for small accidents. They aren't filled with a lot of stuffing and don't give the appearance of a diaper and can make the person wearing them feel a lot better about their appearance."
3,"Value Bay is great, product not up to par.","I purchased some Depends from Value Bay that turned out to have some defects, and even after 3 months, they were more than willing to let me return it and credit my account. You just can't find that kind of service often. Thanks! They are great!"
2,A let down,"The recording is superb, with a warm acoustic, far better than EMI's rivals could manage; the orchestral playing is superb, magnificently balanced so that a great deal of orchestral detail shines through. But the performance is ruined by just one thing: the absurdly slow tempo for the first movement. This movement is the very heart of the symphony and Beethoven wrote it allegro con brio. Klemperer turns it into a plodding andante, destroying the lofty heroism and revolutionary verve that is inherent in the music. It is not only my favourite Beethoven movement but my favourite music of all and I cannot stand what Klemperer does to it. The funeral march is excellent, the scherzo just gets by and the finale is back to the plodding pace of the first movement. I cannot believe the kudos this recording gets when it flies in the face of Beethoven's express wishes. Klemperer's earlier mono recording from 1955 is far better as an interpretation, far more faithful to the composer."
2,dissapointed,I was pretty dissapointed with this season. The fights were pretty boring in my opinion. I was hoping Ken and Tito's hate for each other would make it interesting. Nothing major happened between them. Shamrock showed that he had no clue in what he was doing as a coach. Season 3 did produce some alright fighters though.
4,TUF 3,"pretty darn good series. shamrock was an idiot and it really seemed like all his fighters resented him, while tito really surprised me at how he conducted himself.im glad a few of the fighters left or got pounded out (grove's team dagger partner..fogot his name) both during the show and during fight nite...that was great!cant wait for the other season to come out as well!"
4,It Took a Strange Twist of Fate to make them Two of a Kind,"I was really glad that this cd was finally released on cd....the four Olivia songs on this shine as well as the contributions from Patti Austin, Boz Scaggs and Chicago. I love ""Twist of Fate"" and ""Shaking You"" by Ms. Newton-John and the duet with John Travolta ""Take a Chance"" sounds great....BUT what's with the lousy editing on ""Livin In Desperate Times""...the song was shortened and is remixed from the original....(this isn't even the remixed single version from 1984)....that's my only gripe...."
3,Two Of A Kind soundtrack,"I purchased this solely due to the drumming of Jeff Porcaro. The songs are unfortunately wimpy MOR and pop, but Porcaro gives does his best to make them breathe."
5,Great music,"Jeannie C. Riley was very well known and loved in the sixties and seventies for her storytelling music. This is a wonderful cd. Who doesn't love the song ""Harper Valley PTA""!"
1,Terry Brightbill owns the Trademark,"The original Vogues are not allowed to perform under their name because Terry Brightbill trademarked the name. The real Vogues, the ones who did all the work and created the hits in the 60's, are only allowed to perform in 14 counties of western PA. These guys are not the originals. Form your own opinion about people who pretend to be the ones who did the real work to make the name recognizable.I had to give them one star because of the way this site works but I wouln't have even given them one half considering how they got here. The least they could do is call themselves ""The Vogues - not the real people but a imitation"" kind of like Beatlemania."
1,"The Oil City, PA Vogues - Not the Vogues from Turtle Creek, PA",Imposter group. I am a distant relative of Bill Burkette's family and this is not the real Vogues. Buyer beware.
3,Not exactly beginner friendly,"I am a beginner in crocheting and thought this book would be beneficial. Now, I've only just started reading the book and have yet to put what I've read to the test but I'm already a little frustrated with what I'm reading and the explanations. I feel as though the reading is slightly confusing and the illustrations aren't as effective as I had hoped they would be as I do learn visually with things like this."
2,Hard for beginners,I purchased this book for my granddaughter who wanted to learn to crochet. She lives out of town so I could not teach her. I have crocheted for over 5o yrs and I found it difficult to follow let alone some one who can not crochet.
2,Dummy down,"I thought this was going to be a good choice to learn crocheting, but I was disappointed. The sketches - not photos - are very hard to read and the directions are unclear. Also, the writer keeps trying to be funny - and failing miserably - which is very annoying when all you want to do is learn.Skip this one if you want to become skilled at this craft. I have had more success with another book I purchased after only eight days of purchasing it."
1,It should've been the Original band with Danny Joe,This DVD should've been a classic music video collection of the original Molly Hatchet during the life of Danny Joe Brown. Danny Joe Brown was Molly Hatchet & he still is in every fan's memory & as long as there is Molly Hatchet! Danny Joe Brown will not be forgotten.
3,"Fascinating, if flawed","My title applies to the protagonists of the book as well as the book itself. The three Jerome sisters were certainly fascinating women, though incredibly self-absorbed at the expense of their children. The husbands all come off as cads, which I suppose can excuse some of their excesses. You almost get exhausted reading all the examples of shallowness throughout the generations. There were some eggregious errors by the author (one passage referred to a Tsar of Russia as Nicholas II before Nicholas was even born! The author must have meant his father, Alexander III). It's errors like this that detract from getting into the story. It's entertaining, but not as good as other bios of the time period."
2,Three Interesting Women Over-Killed,"Clara, Jennie and Leonie Jerome are 3 sisters born of privilege in America between 1851 and 1859. They all marry British men and all suffer the ups and downs of uncertain fortunes. Jennie marries into the Churchill family and is mother to Winston. Her husband dies of syphilis and she will marry twice more and have countless affairs. Leslie marries into the wealth Irish Leslie family and bears 4 sons. Clara marries (for love) Moreton Frewen who never succeeds in any of his business ideas.I get that these were important people, but I could have done without the laundry-list name-dropping in every chapter. The book was over 400 pages, but could have been half the size, just as informative and twice as entertaining. I struggled with the last third of the book because there was no development of the women there. Plus, how many more money conversions (of that time to present day value) can one person take?"
3,Great looking truck.,"Great looking body. Came out great but, it didn't fit my 1/18 scale losi properly. the body was too small. I made it work and it looks great so I'm happy."
4,connection of horse and woman,i bought this for young ladies who love horses. some of the book may be deep thinking for teens. but it has a good message of the connection of horse and friend.
3,"Good, but not what I really expected.","This book was just ok. The author is very descriptive. While she knows what she's talking about and you can tell she has done a lot of research and critical thinking, this book just made me go, ""Eh."" when it was done."
5,Cute story for little ones,A friend told me about this book. Is is such a cute story. I was so very happy to find a copy. Well worth the purchase.
4,The best of the biographies,"One (among many) of the unfair knocks against Belloc is that in his later years he lapsed into writing potted biographies in order to fund his living expenses. The riposte: so what? Eminent Victorians is a collection of potted biographies but no one is beating Strachey over the head with that stick because of the literary ingenuity that went into the construction of that forever-fresh classic. The same is true of Richelieu.This is arguably the best of Belloc's biographies--so start here to discern whether you have a taste for this sort of thing. Richelieu is, as with anything written by Belloc, full of wit and wisdom (plus composed in that sparkling, fluid style). The construction, however, is what makes this book stand out from a number of other Belloc biographies (with the exception of, perhaps, Danton). Simply put, the book is well made. If anything, it reminds me of the kind of scaffolding one finds with an Ackroyd biography (another wonderful author)."
2,Null'altro che una curiositÃ ,"Il grande Renzo nazionale, cavalcando l'onda del successo del primo live di ""Quelli della notte"", realizza un altro disco di brani estratti dalla famosissima trasmissione RAI omonima, ma il risultato non va aldilÃ  della (oggigiorno) storica curiositÃ .Che sia un disco senza pretese lo anticipa ad onor del vero Arbore stesso nelle sfiziosissime note del CD. Ma se siete dei veri arboreani questo disco non puÃ² mancare nella vostra collezione."
2,disappointed buy,"i dont often do reviews but i thought this product needed one..i was very excited to get this paintbox palette to store my makeupHowever it came cracked in two places because of: 1) lame packaging {it came in a bubbled envelope} and 2) i thought the plastic was not very sturdy and easily breakable..A better buy?? Search ""BOBBIN CASES""...alot of them are cheaper, trasnparent, sturdier and youd get better value for your money!"
3,dvd format not blue ray booo,is a sham for a thirth isntallmentof the series that the quality of the picture and sound is equal regular dvd and not blue ray format quality . waste money since allready have it for regular dvd. hope this help other
4,Series is getting better with each movie,"The RE series is getting better with each installment. This movie is predominantly about how Alice comes across a roving caravan of some of the last remaining uninfected humans. They are trying to find a way to a rumored safe city in Alaska.The action and special effects both take a step up in this movie from the previous ones and the Blu-Ray DVD transfer is done well. The images really pop in Blu-Ray. The disc has several special features that are worth watching as well.By this point in time, if you are a fan of the RE series, you will really like this movie as it is everything that you would want and expect and is done better from a production standpoint than was done previously."
1,disappointing film,"movie is disappointing, the movie doesnt measure up to the video gamesi watched the movie with disgust and slight resentment of a butchered video game,the movie sucks for the following reasons:forgettable plottired rip off of other filmsplayed out clichedont waste your time with resident evil apocalypse, it is a waste of timestick to the video games like resident evil 4 and 5, they are fun and an entertainment"
1,"Unbox is a joke, Movie is ok-good",So far the Unbox project is a total loss. I've purchased (not rented) videos that I can't even access anymore. My library rarely is correct on what items I have purchased. I have yet to get ANY help from Amazon regarding these problems.This is just icing on the cake of the crud service Unbox represents. I highly recommend not using Unbox service until they turn it around or at least admit to the countless bugs it has.The actual movie is fun for people that enjoy this genre.
3,Good,"As with Live Free or Die Hard, this movie will come to dvd in an unrated format. The movie has probably the worst editing of scenes in a horror film since Friday the 13th Part 7: the New Blood. Just when you think your going see some cool gore, it cuts away. Its a given this movie will come out unrated. I thought the movie went by fast and the story didnt seem to gel. I still enjoyed some scenes but it does seem a bit rushed. Enjoyable if you dont follow storys and want violence."
2,Not As Bad As I Heard,I am a big fan of Milla Jovovich. But I must say I also don't cut her much if any slack if her movies stink. I liked the first Resident Evil movie and thought the second one was just plain horrible. I had heard from several people and from several reviews that this movie basically was a dog. I must say that after watching it that I thought it wasn't that bad and was superior to #2. I liked Milla's action scenes and though the movie wasn't as good as the first it was entertaining.
4,THIS IS REALLY A GOOD MOVIE . IF YOU ARE A FAN OF RESIDENT EVIL ITS A MUST HAVE,IF YOU ARE A FAN OF RESIDENT EVIL ITS A MUST HAVE FOR YOUR DVD COLLECTION. IT HAS SOME GREAT ACTION IN IT. ITS VERY FUN TO WATCH . I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE.
5,fast paced,the RE series has come back for a third film. based on the previous films RE Extinction is a fast paced well-done film of action and horror but focusing more on action than the previous films.
3,A gamers struggle,I am torn between liking this series of movies and rejecting them for many a few reasons. Mainly its the fact that niether movie follow the game. Resident Evil Apocolypse was close only because it was in Raccoon City and it featured Jill Valentine. But overall there isnt much there. Only a few key elements of these movies tie in with the game..Umbrella Corp and the un-dead. Thats it.
1,Alice in Zombieland,"As a guy who plays the games I can say as a fan of Resident Evil that watching this movie is equivalent to being violated by a rusty chainsaw. Alice isn't so much a character as an eldritch abomination feeding on the competence of everyone from the games. What's worse Alice's powers don't make sense even in the often absurd rules of the games: for instance, the t-virus gives psychic powers-it bears repeating, psychic powers from a mind destroying virus, think about it.All in all, this wasn't a Resident Evil film so much as rambling love letter to one Mary Sue."
4,A Great Return to Form!,"After the disappointing second movie outing for this console game, I was expecting the third instalment to be a disaster of epic proportions and signal the franchise's demise. Wow, was I surprised! This is a really great action movie. The set pieces are all cool. The way they further develop the character of the lead is interesting. The special effects and story both bring something new to the franchise.There were a few minor niggles: the Vegas location could have been exploited for more; the super zombies were a little easy to kill with a knife to the throat(?); the climax battle was a little short. But all in all, I'll enjoy watching this again - always the sign of a good movie experience."
3,Resident Evil: Extinction,"Since the last ""Resident Evil"" movie, the zombie-making virus has spread across the entire planet. The world is a wasteland, but the Umbrella Corporation still exists underground. Alice (Jovovich) teams up with a group of survivors, led by Claire (Larter), who are heading to Alaska. Rumor has it that the infection hasn't reached there yet. Soon, the Umbrella Corporation is targeting Alice and messing up the group's plans.""Resident Evil 3"" is better than ""2"", but not as good as the original. This time around, things seem more tame, with less blood and gore. That will upset some die hard fans. There is plenty of action though. Milla Jovovich seems to be enjoying herself as alice, and although she has said that this is the last film in the series, the ending opens up infinite possible sequels. This film is for fans of the series only."
5,LIL PUPPET,"LIL PUPPET IS A PRETTY MUCH UNKNOWN RAPPER FROM 818 SAN FERNANDO, BUT HES IS REALLY ONE OF THE BETTER SPANISH RAPPERS OUT THERE RIGHT NOW, IN MY OPINION. lOTS OF LAID BACK OLDIE BEATS, BUT THERE ARE SOME HARDER SONGS TOO. ALL THE TRACKS ARE GOOD, BUT THE STANDOUT CUTS ARE HIDE AND SEEK, IT'S ALRIGHT, THE BOULEVARD, WHOS THAT VATO. GOOD PRODUCTION AND GOOD BEATS. I RECOMMEND THIS ONE."
3,Cute Shirt,"The shirt is cute, although a bit tent like and the stitching has the big backing on it so that it itches, but I suppose all embroidered items are like that. I thought it was a fun shirt to have to keep all those people that you aren't that close to from rubbing your belly like it's a buddha! At least ask first!"
1,cordless phone batteries,I purchased three of these batteries to replace the original batteries that lasted 3 or 4 years. These batteries only lasted about a year and we got rid of the phones and purchased new cheap phones that are working great.
5,Fits & Works Fine,"Whether this Battery is an official VTech battery or not, to me, doesn't matter. I just want to know if it's going to fit into my phones and work or not. It does both, it fits and works and I'm happy! Thank You for a cheaper alternative to these batteries.....or having to buy new phones!"
2,"Works, but battery life is not great.","For the price, it is certainly worth considering. But don't expect a full charge to last as long as some of the more expensive brand name batteries. If you charge your phone daily, this should work and is much less expensive than some other options."
4,All That I Needed,"I just wanted to share the incredible feeling that just a little patience managed to get me after reading this book. Mr. Gallwey has managed to put into words how one feels and thinks when involved in sport (any sport not just tennis). I first read this book 18 years ago, and my snooker game (billiards) improved immensely. For anyone wanting to master their sport, and find out what ""being in the zone"" is all about, this is a MUST read!"
1,"I wasn't very impressed with this product, as ...","I wasn't very impressed with this product, as it was difficult to get off and on. The absorbency was great though, so I guess this product might be great for some people. I didn't like it for myself or for my elderly father who was in a nursing home."
2,Placed on Auto-Ship but Never got Second Order!,"Depends are a good product I have used for elderly relatives many times. I was delighted when I found I could purchase them on Amazon and have them auto-shipped with a discount. The original order arrived on time but the second order never came. I checked my account and found no mention of repeat orders. The item is no longer carried by Amazon, but they never notified me. Now I have to go to the store and buy them or pay $12 for 3rd party shipping."
5,Dress Boots,I like these boots and they are really comfortable. I enjoy wearing them and I have gotten lots of compliments.
3,good battery,"i like this battery for long time, long life for my remotes. please pick some good seller when you buying it. don't buy from ""Efunctional"" at amazon, the web and pictures shows 5 pieces batteries, but only ship out one piece."
1,JUNK!,I ordered two of these for my long bed Ford. The first one would not stay tight. It's like the teeth would slip if you cranked it hard enough for it to hold in place. The second one didn't want to ratchet at all once I got it snug against both sides. Finally I managed to get it to go and lock it down. Then I decided I wanted to move it a bit higher. Now when I went to put it in free slide mode to loosen it it wouldn't budge. I had to kick it until it bent enough to pull it loose.Great concept but the ratcheting mechanism on this particular one sucks. Find a different one. I am once I return this scrap metal to Amazon.
5,Great product,"I have a Ford Ranger and this works great, in fact, my son took it for his Jeep and I just ordered another"
1,Never ever buy this.,i have two different brands of blu ray players. one is an LG 2D and the other a Panasonic 3D. didn't work on either. tried the whole flash drive thing that people suggested and it didn't do jack. do yourself a favour and save your money.
3,King George the Tinkerer,"Lucas, you are a horrible judge of aestetics of cinema!Can't you just leave well enough alone.I mean you have already ruined the Star Wars saga with your incessant need to CG-enhance every scene and you have now ruined the one film of yours that I believed you couldn't. It is so obvious what you added to THX-1138 that it sticks out like a sore thumb. Buyer BEWARE. Also, the original version of THX-1138 is NOT available on DVD as a previous reviewer has claimed.You might find a crummy VHS copy of it,but that's it unless this guy knows something the general movie going public does not.Just like the original Star Wars trilogy due out next week,the only versions on dvd available in this country are the CG-tweeked versions.Shame on you Lucas,you MORON!"
4,A great movie but a bit too drawn out,"This movie speaks of a future world, where people are kept from following their feelings by taking a daily dose of medication.The main character stops taking this numbing medication and starts to feel, and do things that gets him thrown into exile.This is where the movie gets a bit too drawn out, but then it may just be the intent of the director/writers to make us feel like the main character in his situation."
3,Technical problems with the DVD,"The movie itsself is terriffic, but there are a plethora of technical problems plaguing this DVD. The subtitles are cut off and red in parts, certain scenes freeze your ability to skip forward, These are extremely annoying problems that mar an otherwise enjoyable experiance."
4,Star Wars?,"I dont' understand how the director of this movie made the last 3 star wars movies. What happened to the creativity? What happened to his obvious Kubrik influence?Lucas, is really, really good at making movies with little dialogue, and in THX 1138 he is at his very best. Part David Lynch, part Kubrik, part Lucas, somehow it all comes together at the end.This movivie OOZES creativity and slaps you upside the head with a non-conformist attitude. What happened Lucas?It's not a great movie, but its a ground-breaking movie, the soundtrack of the overlord chatter is great. The use of white as something to strike fear is genius(now I see why storm troopers were white instead of tired old black.I want the Lucas of the past to remake the last 3 Star Wars movies!"
4,"THX 1138, George Lucas first movie","This is the first movie George Lucas ever did. It is about a man in the future where emotions are illegal and supressed by drugs. As he works at an android building plant he soon develops and interest in his female roomate LUH 3417. As there emotions secretly grow they soon start having a deeper relationship(intercourse). Both are soon arrested and put in jail. THX with the help of a friend soon escapes jail and is then pursued by the android cops of his time.After watching this movie and seeing that is is a rerelease it appears to me that there might have been some changes from the original. While the there was a story unfolding it almost seemed pieced together. This is George's first movie after all.That being said it is a good movie. The part where it really gets interesting is in the chase. The feel of the movie is kind of like a mix between the inside of the Death Star and Cloud City. All white, really clean but with lots of pedestrians."
4,It was Great!,"I am a huge fan of Star Wars, thus I was curious about George Lucas's old films. I read the reviews on this one and I bought it. At first, I was nervous. I was afraid that I was not going to like it or I would not understand it. I was very wrong. It is now one of my favorite movies. It is just as good, if not better, than Star Wars."
4,COOL!,"For as long as I've been a fan of Star Wars and anything George Lucas, I never had seen THX1138. The 2 disc edition was really good and I'm glad that I finally was able to see this movie. I noticed some things in the movie that were present in Star Wars, such as great use of sound and imagery. George Lucas was truly ahead of the pack at an early age."
3,Interesting,"Pretty good and interesting movie. A different take for its time and a very intelligent look into the future. It isn't for everybody and people who immediatley see 'George Lucas' and think ""well I liked Star Wars so I will probably like this are probably going to be disappointed.I liked it."
5,"Lucas' student film wonderful, with huge stars before they were widely known!","THX 1138 - directors' cut is a very good movie. It is along the lines of Logan's Run or Zardoz, but those comparisons are made so often that they are kind of trite. Lucas' picture is really GOOD sci-fi fare! I could not watch it very frequently, due to that nature of the dystopian future that he presents us, however. Magnificent film, promptly delivered in good condition by amazon.com! TY, amazon. :)"
4,Bizarre but thought provoking.,"I watched this flick many a moons ago. I absolutely hated it then. Now, however, it is just weird but I get the point. After having seasoned by movies like ""Soylent Green"" and ""Omega Man"" (and others), I get the point. It's like having domineering parents on steroids, just a lot more efficient."
4,Where it all started,"Movie was a bit out there, but I'm certainly glad that I saw it. Given that THX 1138 references abound in Lucas movies, I had to see what he kept referring to. Although it certainly isn't his finest work, you can still see the genius at work in that the movie actually made you think. Great movie for the die-hard Lucas fan!"
5,very good,"It is hard to believe this was Lucas' first attempt. This is a classic, very well done. It is a reflection of modern society, which is useful. Well worth watching."
2,Not worth it,I found the material to be poorly written. There is no glossary to clarify the poorly explained vocabulary in the text.
3,It's okay,"This book is outrageously priced, with the nasty textbook manufacturer trick of putting out a new edition so you can't dump it at the bookstore. Other than that it is okay. It's laid out in a neat paragraph format and the text is actually not a strain on my eyes."
3,"Overall alright, but I think Niles could do better","I must say that this book was a little disapointing, but it was an o.k. book. I enjoyed the conspiracies and the hike into the mountains to find the griffons, but I don't understand how the mountain ""giant"" could sense that Sithas and Kith-Kannan needed help."
2,More Dragonlance Drivel,"I like fantasy. I even like that much maligned fantasy setting, Dragonlance/Krynn. That is why I can't stand to see it butchered. Super-powered elven superheroes - I've seen it in WAY too many fantasy stories and don't need it again. Dragonlance books work well when they're light page-turners...this doesn't work because it's too complex, but because it's so flimsy it's not even a pageturner. Niles commits the cardinal sin for a writer - he's not interesting, at least here."
1,1 star,"I DON'T LIKE IT, BECAUSE THE SONGS ARE BAD. AND I DON'T LIKE IT, BECAUSE THEY ARE RE-PLAYED. I DON'T RECOMMEND IT."
2,vastly overrated,"a very immature voice and the arrangements of some tracks do not suit the songs. Expecting the standard of Michael Buble or Jamie Cullum, it was a great disappointment. Only one or two tracks are bearable."
1,I didn't like this either.,"It sounds like the lead singer (Kim), the backup singers, and the band are all in different keys. If you have an ear for music, this effect will definitely make you cringe as if you want to reach into the radio and get them all on the same key. CD for sale!!"
2,Not the same as the filling from the No Bake Cheesecake box,"I followed the directions for ""pie filling"" and got pudding anyway. Lame. It's nothing like the creamy deliciousness that you get from the mix in the Jello No Bake Cheesecake. I don't care for the crust that comes with the No Bake Cheesecake and I had hoped this would be just the filling component. It's not. :("
4,"Solo, maybe not - but as an ingredient...","No, this pudding mix doesn't have the thicker texture of the no-bake cheesecake mix. It's cheesecake /flavor/ pudding. And in a brownie-based trifle with raspberries, the cheesecake flavor is a winner over the more traditional vanilla or french vanilla puddings that are more readily found in my local stores."
3,"Good, but a far cry form the novel...","While I enjoyed this movie and the message behind it alot, I was very disapointed by how much it deveated from the book. Many events were left out changed, or put out of order. Peekay still is an admirable character who fights for what he knows is right despite the obstacles he faces. It was just such a disapointment to see the other characters who had such an impact on his life, his determination to succeed, and his beleifs downplayed or all out ignored in the movie. I would recommend you see this movie, but read the novel also, you'll get a lot more from it."
2,Huge disappointment after the book,"I recently read The Power of One and was blown away by the moving and triumphant story. One of the best books I've read in the last 5 years, hands down. So I was eager to see the movie rendition.Shocking let-down. Huge, important sections of the story omitted; central relationships between characters not explained; and worst of all, the movie has warped the ""message"" of the book towards apartheid, vs. the book's message of individual achievement and triumph.The movie story is hollow, confusing, and unbelievable. If you read the book and are excited to see the movie, rent it - do NOT own. You will be sorry.(One major plus, however, is that the soundtrack of Power of One is amazing.)"
1,not worthy of the great book,"I can't imagine anyone being able to adapt ""The Power of One"" into a film. The book has too many important characters and events for a single film to cover the material without feeling rushed.That said, this movie misses the mark so badly that if I had seen it prior to reading the book I would never have read the book."
3,"Read the book, if you can't: watch the movie","The movie is quite good, and I loved it when I first saw it. But after readng the book, I realized how inadequate the movie was at capturing the full spirit of the novel. Without the burden of a love interest, and with many fascinating and important plot differences, the book expresses the power of the human spirit. It is my favorite book, and I feel that all people who've missed reading it, have really missed out on something. READ THE BOOK TODAY"
2,"Good movie, just can't beat the book","I would recommend this movie to someone who hasn't read the book because it is very touching and it offers a good insight into the real life drama that happened and is still happening today. However, if you have read the book...I think that this movie is absolutely terrible as a follow-up. There is so much more in the book and so much more action and so many more twists and turns. If I were to recommend something, please read this book...the movie has nothing on it."
5,A Deep Cultural Enrichment,"Her music will give you a profound sense of respect for Latin American cultures, it can transport you there as well as it can touch your soul"
1,Poor Quality,"Buster Crabbe has always been one of my favorite actors. Unfortunately, his Westerns have suffered neglect over the years. I have several on VHS and when this DVD version appeared, I snapped it up...only to discover that the quality really sucks. The picture is dark and murky. And in several cases there were so many splices and missing frames I finally gave up. I'd give this half a star if I could. Maybe someday someone will dig out pristine copies or the negative (not likely!) and we'll get to see these gems as they were meant to be seen. Meanwhile, stay away from this turkey!"
4,Pentel Graph Gear 1000 Automatic Drafting Pencil,"This mechanical pencil is a perfect 10 except for the retract, whic is not so bad once you get use to the fact that the side clip is how the tip is retracted. All in all though I would highly recommend this mechanical pencil as the best I have ever owned. I would give this a rating of 4.5 stars. I would give it a full fifth star if it had simply added a simple diagram to show the operation of the pencil."
3,"Nice-looking, well-built, but not grippy enough","When I first got my hands on the Graphgear 1000, I was immediately impressed with the high-quality aluminum construction and the retracting tip feature that prevents those irritating holes-in-pockets and bent tips. But, as I first started to write with it, I realized that the fancy knurled-aluminum-and-rubber grip was, well, not grippy enough for my writing style. I hold the pencil in an unconventional manner, and this may have to do with the problem, but I found my old $1 plastic-built pencils easier to hold. I feel that the knurling is too fine; they should make it coarser. As a drawing instrument, though, it's pretty comfortable.Overall, I gave it 3/5 because it's a high-quality piece of kit, but since it is hard to grip (for me) and is really rather pricey ($15 ~$20), there are other choices out there that may be suit you better for a lower price."
4,"Great pencle, but","This my third one of these. I'm left handed and press very hard on the paper and write at an inclined angle. I break the lead from every pencil I use except this one. It's handy. It's comfortable. I used the plastic, inexpensive version for some time but they would last about 3 months and the barrel would break at the top of the threaded section above the tip. I bought the Graph Gear 1000 because it had an aluminum barrel. My first one lasted about 2 year. This was good. Then it broke in exactly the same place as the cheep models. It turns out that the idiot designer used the exact same plastic threads as used in the cheaper model and put an aluminum tube over them.I lost my second one. Now on my third. I'm not really thrilled about the internal quality of this item but it is still better than anything else on the market. For a [...] item you would think they could put metal threads in the barrel."
5,Great Mechanical Pencil (shop Amazon sellers for a great deal)....,"This is a great mechanical pencil - in fact I now use it more for writing than anything other than my keyboard. The tip easily retracts, it is very comfortable to hold, and if you check the price from various sellers through Amazon you can find it for little more than half an Andrew Jackson, which is about 50% of what other online sellers and some big-chain art stores are selling them for.I liked this model so much I also bought the .5, .9, and .3 sizes and use them all at various times, but if I were going to get just one however, I'd go for the .7mm, since its large enough not to break and small enough to not look like I'm writing with a big black graphite stick..."
3,For the Movie,"I saw the movie. Enjoyed it, but there were several dull moments and several bad CGI effects. Still it is amazing to me that movies like Alien, Aliens, Jurassic Park, Terminator 2 still blow most of these new movies out the box. Not one of said movies do I ever not believe what I am looking at. However, I can't say that for King Kong. The scenes where they are running form the dinosaurs simply looks bad as in the old movies with movie screen behind them. there are other bad CGI, but I don't want to dwell on it. Overall the movie was good, but not as good as the original 1933 movie despite the outdated effects."
1,'Insert Material Here' on 'Insert Material Here',"Philip Athans constantly used this phrase, turning me off to the book in the first two chapters. It never gets better, and is a complete waste of money and time."
1,Baldur's Gate,I have played the computer game so I was very troubled about the author messing around with the main characters. He killed Jaheira and she is in the next computer game- Shadows of Amn. Over all it waas very poorly written. I have never given a bad review but this needed to be said.
4,Works well,"I am very happy with this purchase, the only thing that keeps it from receiving 5 stars is that it is fairly difficult to change the heads on the shaper. The razors are very easy to insert and remove but swapping the heads is a challenge."
4,Fun & Functional,This is a great item. It makes cleaning up toys after bath time very easy. I only wish it stuck to tile as directed. We screwed it to the side of a cabinet instead... problem solved. I recommend this product.
3,ok,the frog is very cute and is made of durable plastic but it is massive! I am not sure i will put up in the bathroom as its way too big.
2,Didn't stick!,"I followed the directions exactly and the Pod fell off after two days. I hope I can get something at the hardware store to help it stick, short of permanently attaching it to the wall."
5,love it!,"I purchased this frog after buying almost every other bath toy holder made and returning them the next day because the suction cups never held. I read all the reviews on this product and decided to give it a try. I mounted it exactly as the directions stated and haven't had one problem. It stayed up perfectly and it holds all my sons bath toys, soaps and wash clothes. Love it!"
5,LOVE IT!!,"This is a great item. I have had it for over a month and it has not fallen off, like some of the reviewers. It is very sturdy. I will buy in the future as gifts!!"
2,It does not stick!,"I wanted to add my ten cents. Our first frog pod did not stick (we had it over grout lines). I called Boon who were very professional and accommodating and then sent out new stickers, and gave me a warning about the grout lines, as well as sending me anchors and screws to secure it to the wall! We were very careful about how we cut the stickers this time but again after three days this poor frog was on it's back, in the tub with toys strewn everywhere. We made sure not to overload it, only light foam letters and numbers. I am at a loss as I love this product but we hadn't planned to make the long-term commitment to the Frog Pod of drilling it into the wall! As other reviewers have said, it's sturdy, useful, well made and very cute. However, if it doesn't do the one thing it's supposed to, maybe Boon need to go back to the drawing board, or buyers need to steer clear until this annoying problem is fixed."
5,Fantastic Item,This is a fantastic product. I called the company's customer service because I was concerned about the sticking to the wall problem. They were very helpful and gave some great tips. It has worked flawlessly for me and has finally fixed the tub mess problem.
2,Ok,"Could never get this to stick on the wall, very disapointing. Spent a good amount of money on it and was never able to use it."
3,Better suction?,"It's a great concept - but getting it to stick to the bathroom wall can be a challenge unless you're willing to drill holes! Overall, good product..I just need better solution"
2,It's too big for a small tub!,"We registered for this before my daughter was born without actually seeing it in real life. It is huge! I don't know anything else about it because we never used it and gave it to my sister-in-law. We have a small tub and it was way too big to try to put in there. So if you have a large tub I'm sure it is wonderful, but don't buy it if you have a small one!"
2,"cute, but huge and doesnt work on uneven surfaces",I bought this item looking for something to hang in the tub. I didn't like the net versions. I had wanted to install it in the tub so the toys could drain and they would be easily accessible. Unfortunately it doesn't mount to a curved tub at all so I had to mount it to the wall and put a towel under it to catch the draining water......bummer because it is very cute and better looking than the other options out there.....at this point it should just get a wire basket and put a towel under it. Ohhhh well!!
2,Cute but does not stick,"I give this two stars for cuteness and for the practicality of it...IF it would actually stay on the wall. After a week or two, our frog took the plunge. We were using the self-adhesive strips. The suction cup option did not work at all. I followed the instructions to a T, but maybe this does not work with the slightly rough textured tile in our bath (the kind that is supposed to look like tumbled marble) since from the reviews it seems to work for others? I didn't want to drill into the wall, so I gave it away."
5,"so, so cute","i love it. my son loves. and i can't believe how easy it was to mount with the suction cups. we admittedly don't load it with very much- just a few boon toys and some scrubbies- but it works like a charm and isn't going anywhere.if you do choose to use the suction cup option, make sure you clean the surface area the same as you would to prepare for adhesive strip mounting.couldn't say enough good things about boon, their products, and their costumer service. we are definitely a boon family."
3,Not my favorite classic,"Classics are my favorite books. Their wordy, sometimes roundabout, but nevertheless substance-filled sentences make for satisfying, but not necessarily quick reading. This book, however, was as close to a ""quick read"" as any classic I have ever read. But the story could have been told in an even shorter novel. The narrator recounted his love again and again and made several actions numerous times. The novel felt empty and impersonal, the actions of the main characters and the ""love"" they felt for each other, based on superficial whims. If written in modern-day prose, this novel would not have been nearly as notable. Nevertheless, because I have a soft spot for classic literature, I enjoyed this book."
2,Disappointing,"Reading fiction is supposed to be for enjoyment. This book had me feeling like pulling my hair out. Too many times I had to ask myself how old is this author, because it reads like it was written by a teenager. I had to skip to the end, I couldn't take it anymore. Also, too many grammatical errors.The author says it is book one in a trilogy. I really hope she develops her characters and a story line."
1,"Trail Blazer TBL-24JRA 3"" Jumbp Anvil Ratchet Lopper with Telescopic Handle",I am highly disappointed in this product. I would have not bought it if I had known the weight but the weight was not mentioned. I am a 75 year old woman and my husband is 77 years old - neither of us can handle this lopper. I had used a friend's lopper of another brand and just assumed this would be the same weight. It cost $16 to ship it to me and I didn't want to spend another $16 to send it back so I just decided I would give it to charity.Bonnie
1,poor quality,"This lopper worked great for a couple of days then the handle bent and it wouldn't ratchet all the way through, so then it was useless. I returned it. Hey, I'm no mocho man, I'm an old lady. Stick with the Fiskar brand."
5,Soothing Sonics Scenes,"I love ambient, minimalist music and the ""songs"" here are just that. Simple, soothing, sonic scenes are somewhere along the lines of early Brain Eno and/or just about any modern, pensive film score. These pieces could be used well in film, but are equally as enjoyable for background listening and/or serious relaxation music. This is definitely not modern dance ""electronica"". There are no annoying drum machines or obvious synthesizers. The music is ethereal, beautiful and unique."
3,In Your Face And Nasty,"That pretty much sums up this live set from Tejas' metallers Pissing Razors, who rival fellow Texans, Pantera, with their inexorable drive to slam as many riffs into a single song as possible. That they can do this well in an old school metal context is a testament to their talent. New vocalist Andre Acosta does his best Phil Anselmo grunt impersonation on such visceral cuts as ""World Of Deceit"" and ""Fork Tongue,"" sounding very convincing behind the band's double bass drum grooves and jackhammer riffs. The rest of the band rides the edges of coming apart on ""Vengeance Is Mine"" and the plain brutal ""Justice Denied,"" but manages to keep it together. The only problem with their downright militaristic approach is that the songs begin to bleed into one another about halfway through the disc. Acosta even has the same spiel at the beginning of almost every song, inciting audience participation. All told though, these guys are far better live than in the studio and this proves it."
5,Alaskan Thriller!,"Learned a lot about Alaska, the Aleuts and some of the laws on the tribal lands. Strict alcohol laws are in effect on these protected areas.The story is impressive by itself. Mystery abounds; then add in the scenery of Alaska, the demeanor of its people and the story is outstanding.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
4,A Cold Day for Murder (Kate Shugak #1),I enjoy learning about Alaska's history and scenery while at the same time I am interested and intrigued with the plot.
3,unbelieveable,Living alone in an area with a lot of people around is already difficult for a single woman .But in this book d woman's life is soo in order
2,Too much description - not enough action,"I was excited when I saw this book for free and couldn't wait to read it. Well, I guess it's true, you get what you pay for. I read about the first 20 pages, but....nothing happened. It was full of endless description. Mysteries should start fast, grab the reader and never let go. I was never drawn into the story, so quit reading. Not sure I'll ever pick up this author again. The writing was good but the story was just too slow."
4,"Tough-tender Aeut woman, Alaska The Great Land, Justice","Kate Shugan, Alaskan Native Bush-dweller ex-DA investigator, with a college degree, and a scar from ear-to-ear, comes out of retirement or is pulled into problems. Her companion half-Husky/half-Wolf, her lover Jack, activist grandmother, family and friends, all part of The Great Land that is a character in itself. Wonderful characterizations, Native lore, life of subsistance living. Read in chronological order as characters are introduced and developed."
3,this book was an alright read,"I just felt then book drug out the story, it seemed to jump from topic to topic. Just hard to keep up with"
4,Excellent read,I thought Ms. Stabenow did an excellent job describing the area as well as the people of Alaska. The plot was good (although I was sad about the ending). Can't wait to read more in the series.
4,a cold day for murder,this is her first shugak book. no wonder everyone wanted more. it is thrilling and human. simply super. glad i read it.
2,Disappointing,"I like mysteries and I used to live in Alaska, so I was excited to find this series and had high hopes for it. However, instead of the setting serving as another interesting character, the author's use and references to Alaska I found forced and contrived. The main character seemed like yet another cold-hearted-I-can-do-everything-myself woman afraid of showing her feelings for fear that it would get in the way of her professional life. I found her typical and uninteresting."
1,very upset,Actually I did not mean to order this product. I tried over and over again to find a way to cancel my order but every time I tried it would say that I had no orders placed. I could not find a phone number or even an email address for customer service. I was extremely frustrated. I even contacted the business/seller to tell them I did not want to place the order but of course received no response. I am going to return the product and not order through this website again.Jennifer Miller
4,Great for the dreamer!,"Should give you that extra umph youll need to make poker a more serious venture considering how this amateur came from nowhere to win the 2003 wsop main event.There are some areas where it seems like the editor of the book told chris to embellish or make his story seem more exciting although it makes it seem less believable in my opinion-you be the judge. A must add for your library, probably the first book to get."
5,A literary gem!,"Years ago at a writers' conference in South Georgia, I met Ms. Shivers. She read an excerpt from her tiny novel and I was hooked. Now I read it often, especially when I've had to be around people who butcher the english language. Shiver's beautiful prose is like a soothing salve. Ex: ""There were trees along the main street, real tall elms as old and lofty as the Confederate monument on top of the mound in Elmwood Cemetery. In the summers any little stir from the branches fanned the cured tobacco smell from the warehouses and sealed it over the center of town like a jar lid."" Now, who in their right mind, after reading those words, wouldn't want to catch the next bus to North Carolina just to find such a place? Shivers writes like she's sitting in a porch swing, talking. Don't have time for a long book? Pick up a copy of this little jewel. Its rich, southern voice will lure you in and you won't want it to end!"
5,Good Read!!,"This book is great for all ages and a very good read. The characters are well developed and the moral message is strong. With the questionable material geared toward children through TV, movies and books, this book is a breath of fresh air. There are no questionable themes or language in this book, so you can pass it on to children of any age. The quick wit of the characters provide a humor making this book a fun read."
5,A reminder about what life's about,"It is so easy to forget how important and precious raising a child is; in our daily lives we race to get ahead and forget to work on our most important projects: our children.In this book, the author brilliantly tells story after story about how her children were raised; and opens the door to a new way to look at the little people around us. I have a new respect for children after reading this book, and I think you will too.A must-read for any parent!"
4,Wonderfully written,"I entered the lives of 2 others when I read this book and was able to see heartbreak, disappointment, parenthood, a marriage, and the state of SC from their views. Written any other way, I don't believe this book would be near as good. Being from SC, I can say the setting is so accurate I could imagine myself in the different places at that time period. This is a book that should definitely be read by those from any walk of life."
5,A must buy!!!!,"This is a killer album, sounds great, reminds me of actually being at a Kinky show, the energy is amazing. The songs are hooky and upbeat, highly recommend this one, especially Sister Twisted, Linea de Luz and Nothing Really....Excelente trabajo!"
5,UNLIKE ANYTHINGN YOU'VE HEARD - refreshing,"Love it, I walk around NYC with it in my ears.. makes me want dance and I do ... like a nut in the subways :) j/k but it's really good really good"
1,BOYCOTT AARON CARTER'S HATE-RHYMES!,"What you will hear on this CD is pure, unbridled, ignorant racism. In the song ""How I Beat Shaq,"" Aaron talks about beating Shaq, who happens to be an African-American. Aaron Carter talks about all the different ways he would abuse Shaq, and some of it is extremely unbearable. I don't see how this can be put out on a major label and sold to little kids everywhere. All it does is preach hate. Oh, and not to mention the b-sides included on this CD, such as ""The Clapping Song"" in which Aaron speaks of his klan meetings where he and his fellow klansmen dance around a burning cross chanting and clapping. This music really scares me. Why should Aaron Carter be allowed to abuse people of other races? This isn't the 1800's people. Slavery was abolished for a reason. Please boycott this music."
5,Very Cool Book,Knee-deep in the dead is the firt in four doom book I think it was very good i have read all four and I think that this one is the best becouse. One you never know what will happen next it can also make you interested in how and why something may happen. If you liked the game read the book.
5,Doom:Knee Deep in the Dead worth hunting down...,"First of all, let me say that if you're a big Doom fan or just getting into it, do yourself a favor and get this book. Knee Deep in the Dead is extrememly well written and one of those types of books you can put down as you wonder what is going to happen next. Especially with Doom 3 on the horizon for the PC, you owe it to yourself to familiarize yourself with series. It's awesome."
1,Awful,"I really, really hoped for something better. I am not one of those who think game-fiction is a doomed genre, but in many cases I doubt myself. When reading this book, I felt such. Not that I was expecting something well-written with a story of much complexity of substance, but I can find better fanfictions on the internet than this one. Doom the game could definitely have made an interesting book if they threw in a number of interesting characters, some kind of plot and at least a shred of writing skill. Sadly, this book has none. It is the same thing over and over again; main character goes into a room, kills monsters, finds a lever and then goes to the next room, while making snide comments.Even the Baldur's Gate books by Philip A. were better than these, and they were horrible. Do the pubishing companies have to dig out the worst possible authors for writing books based on games, just because most of the audience happens to be young?Avoid."
2,Mindless book,"This book could have been good. Most of the book is full of lousy action fillers. For instance, the main character basically spends most of the book going around blowing away monsters. There's no suspense or thrills to the killing. It's really a horrible mockery of action.Unless you LIKE to read mindless, monotonous, predictable filler, you won't like this book. I just can't believe the average rating of this book is 4 stars!Pitiful."
4,Just what I wanted.,"Bertrand Russell was way ahead of his era. He's a thoroughly modern thinker and worth reading or rereading. Good delivery, good shape."
3,Overall Review,"The movie was based on witchcraft trials, in Salem. Abigail and the other bewitched girls made the devil himself enter town. They went around accusing others of witchcraft knowing Judge Thomas Danforth and the other judges would believe them. When they denied themselves as witches, the girls would pretend something was wrong with them. After Abigail was accused of witchcraft, she tried to put the whole situation on Tituba by saying she put the devil in her, and the devil was telling her to do bad things. John Proctor's affair with Abigail caused her to take the actions that were taken at the time. Her love for him, from their relationship doesn't explain her fierce rage and involvement with the other girls. overall, the movie was amazing and interesting."
2,The Injustice of Salem,"I didn't like this movie because I disagreed with how unjust the witch trials were in Salem. One thing that I admire about the play and the movie was the way Artur Miller used historical facts in the story. My favorite character I think is John Proctor played by Daniel Day-Lewis because he might have cheated on his wife,but at end he admitted his faults,and also at the end he died as a true man, because he stood for what was right.Even though this movie ended very sad, I like the way they show how easily anyone that was innocent could be accused of witchery. Another thing that I didn't like was the way the judges tried to make innocent people lie just to save their own lives."
4,read it,"The movie ""The Crucible"" is an accurate account of the Salem Witch Trials. Arthur Miller wrote the original play in 1953. What makes the movie so great is the fact that Miller also wrote the screenplay. In many sicuations you read the book and you can't wait for the movie. The movie is usually not as good though. This situation is different. In the movie you don't get differnet opinons then in the book.The characters in the movie were wisely picked. For example Daniel Day Lewis did an amazing job as John Proctor. He was able to meet all expectations of a man of his time. His physical and mental apperance were the same as any man of that time. Yes i recomend this movie."
4,A strong re-imagining of a classic,"Not prettied up and Hollywood-ified, this version does right by the play. Though there are notable differences, the contrasts to the original make good talking points. Great performances by Joan Allen and Daniel Day-Lewis."
4,"""Crucible""","Excellent adaptation of the famous Miller play that was a scathing satire of the Senate ""McCarthey Communist Witch Hunt"" hearings of the early 1950's, at which Miller and many of his colleagues were subpoenaed to testify about their awareness of past and present members or sympathizers of the American Communist Party. Many, like Miller, refused to testify, but many others did name names which created a spiritual schism in the ranks of playwrights and screenwriters of that era which lingered for many years and ruined many careers. Daniel Day Lewis is perfectly cast as a man of independent principles who deeply mistrusts the strong hand that the clergy held over the puritan citizens of 1680's Salem, Mass. He freely admits his brief affair with Abigail, 17-year-old niece of the town pastor both to his wife and to the town council charged with investigating accusations by serveral of the local girls that Satan is at work in the village. The ensemble acting by the girls is chilling."
4,The Crucible by Arthur Miller,The Crucible by Arthur Miller was a very interesting movie. It shows how one little rumor can get out of control. A lot of people are hurt or even killed because of one person's revenge. This movie is good for someone who wants to see how the Salem Whitch trials went.
3,Crucible Review,The movie showed a good example of what went on in that day in age. People do not hang each in public.
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Day-Lewis sometimes goes too far over the top (""Because it is my name!!!"") and the actor playing Reverand Hale seems like he was ported in to Salem directly from the 1970s, but the successes of this film adaptation outweigh the failures and make this a movie worth seeing, if not a great one."
1,Very very disappointing,"I bought these rotors in Nov 08, full set front and rear for my 02 F150 4WD truck, I had these on for a few months then began hearing an annoying sound every time I drove slowly and had to apply the brakes (also installed the recommended green-stuff EBC ceramic pads). I decided to take my truck to the brake mechanic after becoming overly- annoyed, only to find out that the front left side rotor had a nice full circular grove about 1/8"" deep on the inside of it and the pad showed the raised area where the groove was made. I became very disappointed not to mention amazed as was the mechanic at my mis-fortunes for these rotors appeared to be virtually indestructible according to the product specs and the fact that these cannot be machined and r not available individually, I am now left with a wasted, useless set of rotors....well at least I didn't throw the box away......very very disappointing."
2,"a fun, quick read","This was an intersting book, I bought it because I enjoyed Mr. Gunnell's Illustrated Firebird Buyers Guide. I did however get tired of Old Cars Weekly's stupid comments below some of the pictures. Following the accident information there was often a suggestion on how the reader might avoid an accident such as the one pictured, Dumb. Just give me the facts."
4,"Good, but a little outdated.","I read this book translated to the portuguese, here in Brazil.This book is fun and have a lot of good informations.The problems in this book really exists.At first it's a little outdated.It has nothing about the fail of portuguese empire in Africa, in 1970 decade, and nothing about the fall of portuguese empire in East Timor or Macau(China).Also Mr. Charles Boxer wants to show us exemples of racism from the portugueses.Well, ifthe portugueses were racists, the englishman were very deeply racists compared to they.In XVIII century, to example, a portuguese in goverment claims that for Portugal, the man's value had nothing with skin's color, but had all with the man's value."
4,Moving beyond Alzheimer's,"In this film actress Sarah Polley, 28, moves competently into screenwriting and directing, giving an unsentimental and yet not depressing look at Alzheimer's disease. Although the still beautiful Julie Christie plays the victim of the disease, the film belongs to Gordon Pinsent, who plays her husband, the one who must cope with being gradually left behind by his wife, whose memory is fragmenting. He learns to deal with his guilt and loss, to adapt to the situation, and to move on into his life."
4,No fool he!,"Leonard Tourney returns to 17th century England with a wonderfully well-written novel sure to delight anyone who enjoys the English language and is willing to take the time to savor the work.The story is fine and well-told. Shakespeare must get at the bottom of who means him harm, and why. It's a good enough yarn in its own right, but that isn't the real reason to buy the book any more than supplying basic nutrients is the reason for fine dining.There are books designed to be ""page turners,"" which the reader is to inhale quickly. This is not. Time's Fool is best sipped rather than gulped. Tourney's phrases, idioms, and word choices are a true delight to the discerning reader. I read it with a dictionary close by, not so much because I was in doubt about some of the archaic terms which sprinkle the book, but rather because I wanted to admire the author's skill and ""wordsmanship.""When you have the time to savor a good book, you will relish Time's Fool: A Mystery of Shakespeare."
1,ShakespeareTurns Dullard,"The title was intriguing, as are Shakespeare and his plays. However, the writing is dull, the plot is dull, and the story never gets off the ground. It is likely a mistake to assume fiction based on a possible even fictional chapter in the life of the Bard would be as interesting as the works of Shakespeare himself. Always provided, of course, that he wrote them. A question for scholars--they are great works whoever wrote them. The Shakespeare in this book is one boring dithering man, who gazes principally at his navel. I couldn't care about this character, or the mystery of who wanted to kill him."
5,Unbelievably Insightful and Challenging,"For all of us who are parents and share that journey with a partner this book is an amazing resource. It challenges you to improve your situation and truly create the kind of partnership you want with your spouse. The book is funny, effective and at times can seriously push your buttons. I found myself occasionally feeling stressed as I read it because it really made me assess what I like and don't like about my situation. It has REAL life exercises and suggestions to help you make improvements and changes rather than just discussing the difficulties (and of course joys) of parenting and living with your spouse. A great, enjoyable and (for me somewhat life changing) read!"
5,Great Help for Couples,"There are so many books focusing on the ""problems"" of parenting and relationships--and this book is very much about solutions for couples, which I found refreshing and helpful. The underlying premise of the book is to be intentional in our parenting roles and make your kids a priority without sacrificing women's identities or trapping men in breadwinner roles. This author does this without being overly political or preachy and uses humor, interviews with lots of other women, and her own personal story in an effective way. But best are the plethora of tools--discussion questions, exercises, and lists of housework and childcare duties--so that you can pick and choose what you and your partner need to work on. It's a powerful idea and book, no matter what your parenting choices are."
3,mosgt boring book ever.,"This is the most repetative book I have ever read. Just reading the intro to any chapter is all you really need, within the chaper, the author will state the exact same thing 3-5 times. I give it three starts because there is a lot of good information, it is just not well presented."
2,:(,terrible I bought one of these straps and every time while i was stading the back would slip out and my guitar would hit the floor. its happened with my friends guitar once and mine 3 time so i threw it away terrible absolutely terrible
3,OK story. Type a bit too dense.,I've read better by Chesterton (Fr Brown stories). Did not like the ending on this one. Type looked like ebook in print.
5,I felt like Alice at the tea party,"This was a delightful book, if you like odd humor, such as funny contradictions. I felt like Alice at the mad tea party, with all the crazy twists and unexpected turns from where I thought the story might be going. It was a fun ride. Chesterton's works are treasures."
3,Medicen walk,"I liked the book because the dad in the story died when they where flying the dad had a son. The sons name was Burr. Just before the dad died he sayed ""I will be ok when we get down. So the dad made it to the ground.When they made it to the ground the dad died. The boy that was in the blain with the dad the boy had to get out and walk in the desort. He started to hallucinat he thought that he keep seeing a village acept their was no village."
3,Fatal Kiss,"This story was one I had not heard about which surprised me since I read mainly true crime stories and watch all the ID shows. As a reader of true crime stories I am never impressed when the book quotes trial testimony. There are other authors that do the same and I refuse to buy their books. I want a story with background info on the characters including victims and prepatrator as well as any other main players. If the trial relates to the story it would be nice if it was condensed, with emphasis on ""condensed"", into the authors own words. I would recommend the book if you like to read trial testimony otherwise it's not worth it."
2,Bad bad bad,Not well written. Just a sad book. Not worth anyone's time. I was sorry I spent anytime on it at all.
1,Broke after 2 months,I purchased several of these units and some of them broke after just 2 months of use - no wonder why they are so cheap. I would gladly pay more for a quality unit - but these are made in China and most likely mass produced with little to no quality control - so good luck!
4,latin music from the old days,excellent product with history book included on all songs and artist........ ....................\............... .................. ..................... .............. ............. ............ ................ ...........
3,A complement to the movie which does not stand alone so well,"I thought the sound track to the movie was a great complement to it but after I bought it I felt that it did not stand up by itself very well. Its themes seemed too short and disjointed. But, I plan to play it on my CD player in random mode along with other CD's. Then I think it can complement the music it is interspersed with - depending on the music."
5,Nice fit,"Clear voice, easy instuctions, small design doesn't get in the way.The phone cradle design is awkward. I haven't used the fax/ copy features, yet..Seems like a good deal at this time."
1,Threw out after one use!,This product did not work at all. I did not have time to pack and send it so I threw it out!! Can't believe manufacturers put out this kind of junk into the market.
1,Incredibly bad book from two established authors.,"It's hard to imagine how someone as talented as Anthony had anything to do with this unbelievable mess. The humans are unrealistic, the monster completely impossible, and the details ridiculous. Doesn't ONE of those two guys know penguins live in the Southern Hemisphere only? This must have been published only because of Anthony's name: any editor not on drugs would have laughed as he threw it in the reject bin."
4,"Enjoyable, complex, scientific - well worth the time","Spider Legs is a science fiction treatment of the potential results of mankind's use of the ocean as a garbage dump. However, it is also a warning of the potential dangers of a twisted intellect using and modifying those scientific results to force change on mankind.Spider Legs is not easy light fiction. It makes the reader stretch to learn and remember new ideas, new terms, new information. But with the excellent pace of the novel, it keeps the reader enthralled.If you're looking to be put to sleep, or to ""zone out"" with a book (instead of tv) this is not the novel you want to read. This book will make you think, and will then reward you for thinking.I recommed Spider Legs, and hope to see more fiction from Cliff Pickover in the future."
3,Mixes Stephen King type horror with eco-sci-fi,"This is a science fiction collaboration with a lot of science input by Dr Pickover, and fictional input by Piers Anthony. It has more in common with Stephen King than Arthur C Clarke, but the ""baddies"" are motivated by modern fears and play on modern fears by the way they wreck their havoc. It looks as though it also had a lot of research in common with Pickover's book The Science of Aliens, and the plot has a lot in common with Halperin's The Chimeras of Loppet Creek which I personally preferred of the two. But that is a personal preference, and I think the public at large may well like the King-like Spider Legs with its graphic descriptions of people of all sized and genders being eaten alive by monsters. I must say that recovery from some of the injuries described by Pickover and Anthony seems a bit fanciful, I should think."
2,Half baked clay with gold paint slapped on..,"On page 60 Elmo helps convince the police that a spider killed a woman. On page 66 after a TV news report of a giant spider ""He would have laughed it off.. had he not seen that woman's head"" On page 250 an electrican manages to restore some battery power to the ferry. Nathan sees instrument lights come on, then dim. He then walks to the coffee shop, and on page 252 the 'air conditioner' stops running. It's not due to weak batteries: a woman is electrocuted with 'thousands of volts on page 258. These are not 'nits,' the whole book is full of logic errors. Piers has written books I happily re-read to experience golden moments again. Lately, he seems convinced that it will cost him a dollar to hire a proofreader.. If a friend asks for a recomendation, refer him to an older novel, when Anthony still put some craftmanship into his work."
1,No Gray Solution For Me,"I have been coloring my hair for a very long time, and now at the grand age of 37 years oldthe grays are making an appearance. I bought this as it seemed as if it had that extra stepin coating the grays and prepping them for the color to take. Well, I went through the processand right away after stepping out of the shower and drying my hair I could see that the grayswere still showing! It hardly put a dent into my hair color and where some color might look likeroot highlights, there are still very obvious gray showing. Not happy with this product at all!Now I will have to wait a period of time to do try another product because any additional colorsmight be too harsh on my hair."
3,Great hair color!,"I got a great hair color from this! And it was really easy! My main problem was the chemicals in it. As I mixed the formula, the strong chemicals actually made my eyes runny. I will not be using this type of coloring again for that reason. I recommend the brand that used avocados (sorry I can't remember the exact name)- it brought a nice color without the mass chemicals.I forgot to include that I have fairly long hair (3-4 inches below the shoulder) and one bottle was enough for all of it! (I actually had some leftover!)"
2,"""eLearning with Dreamweaver MX""","Most books by Macromedia Press are well written and aimed towards the beginner. This book is neither well written and is aimless.I bought the book to learn more about coursebuilder and although i know quite a bit about dreamweaver, I found this book of little help. There are no files to accompany the book, even though the author (once in a while) refers to them.The biggest problem I found with this book is that it fails to explain with examples, often refering to files you were supposed to create without telling you what file or providing a file for those of us that don't want to start from page 1.The other major drawback is that the book appears unfinished. With a bit more effort and polishing it could be a great book, but as it is, it is difficult to read and very hard to learn with."
4,good solid horror movie,i gave it 4 stars cuz it was much better than expected.........i felt it was a good solid horror movie.........i liked the special fx's with the wolf creature.... overall once the action started it kept a good pace........and the irish or scottish (not sure which one ) background & accents made for a nice touch :):) if ur a horror fan give this movie a chance.....i thought it was a decent horror flick !!!
4,A Good Reference BookI,It pretty much covers whole range of College Algebra. I just wanted it as a reference to use when I needed a bit of a refresher .
3,"Great, but Packaging needs improvement!",I am very pleased with the process. The book that I ordered was correct and sent promptly. The only problem I had was with the packaging. It came wrapped in plastic ONLY! That caused the book to get damaged corners and dents.
3,Abridged edition (edited from Bunyan's original),"The publishers should include on the title page that this is not the actual text that John Bunyan wrote, but an abridged/edited edition. I assign this work for a class and every year students inadvertently buy this book in advance before I can warn them that they need to purchase the book that Bunyan actually wrote. It's a bit of a bait and switch to be publishing it with incomplete/inaccurate information on the cover. Having said that, this edition excels in readability and is worth owning for a junior high or high school student who wants to read the story but would get bogged down in some of the long dialogues and speeches in the original."
3,Not what it seems,"This is actually a reissue of an old 60s LP from the LittleSingers of Tokyo (something to that effect). I know this becauseI recognized the cuts. Basically you have 19 songs performed bya children's choir who are singing to a westernized aesthetic.In other words, the harmories are often very western sounding,not eastern. It does have a recording of the very famous children'ssong Shojoji and others like it. Accompanying the choir is asingle piano player. Sound is pretty good, but not hi-fi, andthe piano sounds like it's far away. However, this isa rare Japanese LP that has made it's way to CD format withoutthe usual outrageous Japanese import price, and should appeal tosome, but not all listeners."
3,OK,This book was very hard to understand.Good information but lacked pictures and diagrams.I will keep it on the shelf but not in my fanny pack----still looking for a good field guide.
1,Not recommended,"the package comes sealed in plastic, but the wipes are not moist enough. I have to use 3-4 sheets at a time and you have to use them too quickly, like in 3 seconds or less, or it is completely dry and useless. They barely removes gook from my laptop screen and keyboard. i miss the 3m wipes that were discontinued"
5,Easy and Affordable,"These are certainly a money saver if you are required to upgrade to inconnectable smoke alarms in an existing house that has not been wired for it. They are easy to install, come with the batteries, and tested out OK after I installed 5 of them. Saved me hundreds of dollars over paying an electrican to pull wires and install hard wired detectors."
2,Disappointing,"I loved the Thieves' World books as a teenager. Unfortunately, the same can not be said now. Shadowspawn was always my favorite character, but Andrew Offutt's new story featuring his character was overwritten to the point of being unreadable and soured the rest of the book for me. There may be better stories by other authors later in the book, but I couldn't force myself to stay interested enough in the goings on of Sanctuary to read them all."
4,A few pieces here for a special collection,"If you're making a CD-R collection or iPod playlist of the 1970-2010 Beatles (alternating the best of their solo tracks), take `Skiing' featuring Eric Clapton, and fade out as it begins to sound like a flock of seagulls landing to fight over a few morsels of bread, and then fade in `Party Seacombe', played by the Remo Four, both pieces presumably with some composing input from George. This meld might go on a bonus CD-R devoted to `Beatles Releasing Collective' tracks that are too borderline or quirky for inclusion on the main sets. In this case the problem is: neat, but is the George content rather minimal? Apart from these two pieces, `Wonderwall' is still an interesting album to listen through a few times, doubtless more interesting than the experimental 1960s film it was the soundtrack for."
1,Not very useful,"These cards are very basic and the definitions, formulas, etc... are over simplified. I could see how these would be useful to a beginner but they are of very limited use to anyone with enough experience to actually take the PMI exam"
5,Jaded -- Not Dated,"This album represents one of the most unique blendings of electronic and metal, with production that is not so much formulaic as it is appropriate. Very polished, yet edgy, but most importantly the music, production, and especially the lyrics and vocals, are all very genuine.If you're so angry, sad, and bitter that you could punch a brick wall, then do it while you listen to this album. It is the PERFECT solution to relationship angst and hatred of the world (and it doesn't sound like a sermon the way Marilyn Manson's stuff can).The music still holds its own without sounding dated, and the bitterness is beautiful. While the Sisters of Mercy's ""Floodland"" was a great album, this one is much richer sounding and has a good amount of musical variety."
5,The Sisters experiment with a little rock'n roll,"This album is different from most of the ones the Sisters put out before, but it is extremely beautiful. It is just as dark and scary as everything else they have done, but much, much meaner. Just to satisfy the curious, the symbol on the cover is Egyptian--it is the Eye of Horus. Why would anyone think it is Celtic?"
3,Not as good as the previous albums...,"This album really is nothing compared to 'Floodland', In my opinion only about 4 songs on this album (if even that) are good. Musically this album is much further in the rock direction...'When you dont see me' is all out rock, and a few songs almost sound like crappy heavy metal. If you want a good Goth album , I wouldnt recommend this, only die hard Sisters fans should get this. Get 'Floodland' or 'First and Last and Always ' Instead. My favourite song on this is 'More' but asside from that nothing else is very impressive, the only song thats worth it is 'more'...But i wouldnt recommend buying an album for just one song..."
1,I am going to make this album into dogmeat,"Never before has my cd player been punished with such repetitious over-produced self-indulgent nonsense. When I listen to this, I can hear Eldridge laughing at those who had previously considered him 'goth'...but I laugh to myself, because 'music' such as this puts him in the 'shoddy Motley Crue cover band' category. Which would he prefer? I loved First and Last and Always and Floodland, I even didn't mind Some Girls Wonder By Mistake...But this? This just sounds like sleezy, late 1980's LA strip-club music. And on his website, Mr Eldridge considers this a 'fine album'? Please. If this is 'fine' music, then why is it that session musicians had to be PAID to play it. Where did the band go?"
2,Field Guide?,"OK....so this book's title is a misnomer.......its more of a history lesson on the very basic entities out there, NOT a true ""guide"" in any sense, it covers the ""best"" known, but does not venture into the beings that are older and possibly, more ""subversive""......It doesnt even mention much of what has been attributed to Ireland, although there are countless books on the subject, i think those in Ireland warrant at least a small entry!"
3,"It was an ok book..but,","I didnt think it was that great. It was good in some parts and very interesting in some parts. However, it does not go deeper in all of demons and other spirits. Most folks that study the occult will say there are better books than this one, which in that case there are. However, i can tell you that you should shop around first, cause this book only does the ""basics"" for the beginner. Anyways, its a good book, but not great."
3,A FIELD GUIDE TO DEMONS,"A FIELD GUIDE TO DEMONSThis book serves well as a reference guide; as well it should, being that it is just that. The book is separated into 6 main sections: Water, Mountain, Forest, Desert, Domicile, and Psyche. The sections are arranged by location such as, North America, Japan and so on. Each reference tells a bit about the lore and also the dispelling and disarming techniques used to eradicate the demon.This book is a good tool for horror writers and or fantasy writers. Any demon within these pages could become a writer's antagonist. The problem with this book is it is very vague in its approach to the history of the demons. Perhaps a more comprehensive layout would serve writers and enthusiasts better.* * * 3 stars"
1,Not worth the money at all,"Both my wife and my electrician managed to break a pair of these. Unless you are really careful when setting the light in place, they give away. It's the cheapest of plastics and does not take a beating."
5,Very handy,"Very well-built little brackets. I will be buying a couple more sets so my mag lites are never too far away. In the car, in the house, perfect!"
4,Try this one on for size.,"Teenage loser Zach on his way to school one day runs across a crashed alien spaceship piloted by a dying Gerldarian. He passes on to him what is called a Tech Jacket, which is a special biomechanical harness that gives its wearer enhnanced strength and other capabilities, as well as becoming a full covering body armor. Zach then gets abducted by some of the Geldarian authorities who think of him as a criminal, but he gains their trust after helping to fight the warring race known as the Kresh. The Geldarians allow Zack to go back to Earth with the Tech Jacket, since it can't be removed once activated. Once there, Zack leans that six months have gone by on Earth and has to fight the mafia and more Kresh invaders to find his missing parents. This graphic novel collects the first six issues of the hit Image Comics manga-styled series in black and white."
5,A History of Instruments and Performing Sociogroupings,"Musical Instruments of the World presents a visual, historical review of musical instruments and sociogroupings of instruments. It demonstrates man's need to communicate and share sound creatively through the ages."
2,"Don't make this your first ""Rusty"" picture","This is the last of Columbia's eight boy-and-his-dog stories of the 1940s. By this time the boy, Ted Donaldson, is now a tall high-school junior and has just about outgrown the series. Good cast (Ann Doran, John Litel, and several Columbia contract players), good direction, good camerawork, but... the misguided screenplay is by the person who generally wrote for The Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys, and you can tell. Donaldson is awkwardly cast against type, getting into a fistfight and becoming angry, introspective, and suspicious of the new kids in town. Not very much footage of Rusty, the handsome German shepherd, either. Diehard fans of ""B"" pictures may be curious to see Donaldson grown up, but others should try one of Rusty's earlier adventures. Print quality is superb but the tape is recorded at the extended-play speed, which may not track properly on all machines."
2,Very disappointing,"The Parrot CK3100 looked like just the thing I was looking for. I drive a tractor trailer so have been looking for a handsfree system with high volume and this is to be incorporated in your sound system. I can hear calls just fine but the microphone BITES!!!! It works great when I am not driving, but at freeway speed people always complain that I cannot be heard, I paid Cicuit City $150 to install it, so I am just stuck with it now, I will just have to keep looking for a decent Bluetooth set."
2,Works ok so far. Non existent installation instructions,Took me 8 hrs to install. Absolutely no instructions whatsoever. I understand that instructions can vary by car - but this is plain simple ridiculous. Had to do a lot of searching online to get the job done.. After installation - seems to work good so far. Full radio volume is not muted on call arrival. Rear sub-woofer still plays the song - but is low enough not to interrupt conversation.....
4,You'll Like it if You Like John le Carre,"If you are a le Carre fan, read it. It is a good book, and much better than some spy novels, but not the best of le Carre."
4,Maxine is a Must,"If you don't know Maxine Sullivan, this album is a great introduction. If you love Ella and Dinah, you will appreciate this spot-on singer, and these great tunes."
5,Don't leave home without it,"This book & spec sheets contain all the electronics information I have ever needed as a hobbyist. It is great for teaching rules of thumb, and an important aid in developing an intuitive feel for how a circuit is going to behave. My only suggestion for improving the book would be to include an appendix detailing why the bad circuits are bad -- it would be good to be able to check one's gut feelings about this against actual information.<script> happyFace(); </script>"
2,An ok Reference Book,"The book does an ok job explaining various parts of electrical engineering. Some parts break things down such that any person could understand what they are talking about. Others, you need to have a thurough understanding of circuit analysis.Does show many good and useful circuits, but does little to help with the analysis of these circuits. There are better books out there that does a much better job overall. At best, this book makes an ok reference book"
3,Used book buy,"This was a used book I bought to replace one that got damaged. The condition of the book was a little rougher than description indicated. A picture of used books would be helpful.This is an iconic book in electronics even though it could use an update, it is very thorough and helps the understanding of basic electronics. It has a lot of examples of DO's and more important sometimes DO NOT's."
2,Useless,"I used this book in college, and I found it fairly worthless. If you already know everything there is to know about electronics, you might look through this book and think it's swell, but I found it impossible to learn from. It was packed full of nerd jargon, as though intended for working EEs with doctoral degrees."
5,One of two books that all electrical engineers should own.,"The Art of Electronis is THE definitive single reference book for electronis. It suggests the best transistors for given applications has most of the important equations in electronics, describes different filtering circuits etc. I use it like a dictionary and it is the single most used reference book I own.BTW the other book all electrical engineers should own is ""Trouble Shooting Analog Circuits"" by Robert Pease"
5,Great for youg children,My 2 year old grandson thinks these books are the cat's meow. He loves the cut outs that pop at him.
2,Factually suspect,"An interesting overview, but so plagued with obvious errors of scholarship that one wonders how much of it must be taken with a grain of salt. As only one example, I was interested to read that the British captured Baltimore during the War of 1812. So much for Fort McHenry, Francis Scott Key, and the ""Star Spangled Banner."""
3,"sounds good, but nothing new","This band sounds good, but what more can be done with this style of punk? They sound very much like other bands that I've heard... Punk is starting to blend together...and the ones that stick out are the ones that impress me. This one doesnt stick out to me. It might be great if you dont have much like it, but I suggest you listen to it before buying."
5,Jimmy C. Newman: Zydeco Begins,"Before ""zydeco"" there was Jimmy C. Newman. Those who enjoy Cajun sounds, real Cajun accordians and the rich mix of Cajun language and culture should know it began with Jimmy C. Newman. This album is a classic mix of Newman's mix: English, Cajun, country and western, and the toe-tapping beginnings of what became Zydeco. Newman's enchantingly slow ""Basile Waltz"" and the peppy sounds of ""Diggy Liggy Li"" make this album worth the price. Toss in the chance to hear the roots of Zydeco, and you have a double bargain."
4,definitely a good start!,"Good place to start on ArcObjects. It primarily deals with the designing of interfaces, rather than using the commands for automation. Good intro to the concepts of the ArcMap Object model, properties, methods, and events...there's even a little blurb or cursors. Covers a little of ArcCatalog, too. Note: ArcTools DOES NOT follow the ArcObject Model...so if you are looking for properties, methods and events pertaining to this, I guess wait 'til ArcGIS 9. Also, there are no scripting cabilities similar to AML...you'll have to wait 'til ArcGIS 9, where python is used as the scripting language to replace AML. Also, does not address OOP concepts on the GeoDatabase model very much...but this book is definately better than Getting to Know ArcGIS"
5,INCREDIBLE EMOTION!,"I have never enjoyed crying so much in my life!!What a poignant, completely engrossing story of two emotionally (and physically) scarred souls, both of whom believe they are unworthy of love. Their relationship builds slowly as they struggle to overcome their inner demons and learn to love and trust each other.This is an extremely moving, emotional story and one of the best books I have ever read, romance or otherwise."
3,"What is a ""woman child""?","I was so fascinated with the story at first that I ordered the author's another book even before I finished reading this book. However, I cannot but wonder how could this never growing ""woman child"" be enough for the man who had lived a life full of bitter agonies and sufferings. I understand the part that he felt himself valuable again because she was weaker than him. But, should she be that way forever? She keeps saying ""I am ugly"" and even tried to hide her ugliness by covering her face with hair. It's just too much! Having a heart as pure as a child is different from have a childish heart. I would love the story far more if she nurtured self-confidence and self-respect to love her husband with confidence, rather than loving him becuase he could not see her ugly face. She sounded like she hoped to have him that way and it's not a heroine I would admire. I am so sorry about the heroine's incurable childishness because other than that, the story was truly wonderful."
3,Not What I expected,"After reading all the positive reviews I decided to purchase this book and give it a shot. I have read a lot of historical fiction and romance, but this really didn't seem to fit. Yes it was a good story to watch Gillian evolve into a prettier, braver soul, but come on. This book wasn't a historical romance, it was a fictionalized account of a self help book. The only thing historical was the setting--a castle. Hmm. Big deal. The plot is basically about the self esteem of both the main characters. They spend the entire book tiptoeing around each other trying not to further damage their own image/ego. The best part of the entire book remains the secondary characters. They have potential. This is not a book to spend money on. If you insist on reading it, get it from the library."
2,A good book but...,"I don't think they should classify this book as a romance novel...There is no love scenes in this book. It's a good book. Great story. I reccommend reading it, but if you are looking for romance this isn't the book for you."
3,What is all the Excitement about?,"I bought the book because it was reviewed so highly. The story was better than average, but basically forgettable."
5,You HAVE to read this book!!!,This was the first book I've read from this author and absolutely fell in love with it. The story stays with you long after you put it down. The strength revealed by both the hero and heroine exemplifies what it means to love. I will be sure to pick up her others.
5,Great Quadrilogy!!,"Was waiting for the right set of X-MEN and this was the one at the right price too. Im not a savy on the picture quality or whatever, but this movies are definitly HD and are a great adition to my BR collection."
4,"Quadrilogy? Oh, you mean a tetralogy.","A good box set. Naming convention is off, but that's of little import. 1 was good, 2 was very good, 3 was good, Origins was decent."
2,Very Disappointed,"DVD listed as having the 71 minute version of Gene Autry's ""The Big Show"". This is the 54 minute version."
5,"Great table, great price","Was looking for a cheaper table to put in a spare sitting area between two chairs and this fit the look I was going for. Table arrived in great shape, easy to assemble and looks great in the room."
3,Winsome Wood Round Table with Drawer,"Cute table, poor workmanship. My husband had to remove the drawer guides and reattach so that the drawer closed properly. But, it's exactly what I wanted and I'm happy with it."
1,Sent The WRONG color! Don't bother,I ordered two of these black round tables to use as bed side tables and even ordered ONE DAY shipping since I needed them by a certain day as we had guests coming over. Instead I got some cherry colored ones that don't match my decor. Extremely pissed about this considering it costed me 100 + for these things that aren't even in the right color. I'm not going to bother sending these back since it would be a major hassle to repack them. What a waste of money. Instead I'll leave negative feedback and encourage customers to look elsewhere as these clowns apparently can't handle sending the right product to the customer.
2,Not as pictured,"The table itself is a good size, but the pictures are deceiving. The top has a visible grain/texture and IS NOT Smooth black. Almost looks like a fake wood grain. I returned for that reason. If that doesn't bother you, the size was large and seemed sturdy. Drawer is tiny. Good for pencils, maybe a remote."
5,I was very pleased with this table!,"I was very pleased with this table. It was easy to assemble and is very nice for the price. I thought the quality may not be anywhere near the expensive table I also have in my livingroom, but it looks great. I would definitely order another if I needed one."
3,assembly difficult,You have to be very careful putting this table together since the wood is not strong enough to tighten the bolts very much. The wood breaks very easily.The table looks nice once it's all put together. Count on a trip to the hardware store.
5,Exactly as stated,"This end table looks classy and has a solid wood top. Its height is a real advantage for those with large sofa arms, making it easy to reach items on the table. Handy little drawer, too. My 14-yr. old son put this together quickly and easily."
5,insidious,"the movie was real spookly,definatly get your attention and keeps it,definatly a good scarely movie would suggest this to someone that like scary movies"
5,awsom,Wow this movey is awsom the best!!!;) yeat lol it's been a long time since i have seen a horr movet that put me on the end of my set yea i love it. awsome hope thay make a 2nd on that stars wher this 1 ende i want 2 see what the josh guy dos lol ;)
1,Very dissapointing,The first half of this show would be a good build up for a really scary movie. That being said the second half of the show is a JOKE! It is like 2 different movies. I don't know how people could have been scared by this movie. Oh how I love to sharpen my claws listening to Tiny Tim!
1,what?!,I just don't get how this movie has such great reviews. I didn't think it was scary or even good for that matter at all. When it first started I thought it would be decent but then it just took a horrible turn and was so cheesy.
1,Lame movie with no special effects,"This didn't scare me and it was cheesy. The chucky movies are scarier than this. Long story short, no impressionable visuals or story line. Save your money."
2,Insidious=Inidiotious,"This film totally builds you up for suspense then pulls the plug on it. In short this film is totally idiotic, and sadly pretty funny. The Exorcist, which I thought pretty much sucked, is alot better than this film. Don't waste your money like I did. Rent it before you decide whether to buy it. Or better yet pass it by completely. There are much better horror films out there. The Shining comes to mind."
2,OK at best ....,"I'm an avid fan of scary movies. I like a good thriller as well. The scene where the family permits the woman to try and make contact with their son whose spirit is trapped in what she called 'The Further"" well I just about lost it when I saw her put that confound contraption on her face...it looked like a gas mask...attached to the mask was a 4 ft hose.. I about laughed out loud when I saw her male associate pick up the hose and attach it to his headphones... this is a 21st century movie.. and this is what they come up with to contact the boy trapped in another dimension? ridiculous... don't buy the movie rent it and see for yourself that it's a crappy movie."
2,Scares are overdone and predictable,"I give this movie 2 stars instead of 1 because I did think the beginning scenes were pretty ok. For instance, I thought the home invasion scene had some suspense to it. I also liked the scene where the ghost is pacing back and forth outside the window and then suddenly appears in the house.However, for the most part the scares were overdone and predictable. I also thought the plot twist was predictable, too. The ending could've been good, but ended up looking cheesy instead. Overall, I didn't find this to be too scary."
1,This is a complaint abt the free preview...,"The free preview of the video is a waste of time... it is 2.xx minutes of the opening credits! Only about 48 seconds are actually the movie, itself! WASTE OF RESOURCES AND TIME!"
1,got wrong one,not in english i got wrong one so sad o well it is what is is not sure if can send back o well
3,Modernistic but thought provoking,"Before embarking on this year long program, get the video discs and preview the videos. Many segments are from people who do not believe the bible is the Word of God, liberal theologans.The Discipline is Good, reading is good. The study book is based on the Translators Bible which is Ok.Isaiah tells us the nations are so much dust in the eyes of the Lord, how much less so their seminaries?"
3,"A decent comeback, but certainly no classic","Songs like My Sugaree and City's Still Growin' show the band was capable of rocking on this comeback (from '84). But in total, the effort is uneven. Too many forgettable tunes with unremarkable melodies. It didn't help having a mediocre talent like Tim Bachman back in the fold. He was no great guitar player."
4,Wrong cover,"...this is not the original BTO I but the 1984 comeback. Great guitar work by Randy on ""City's Still Growin'."" At this price, you'd be crazy not to pick this one up!"
2,Piffle,"There is zero chemistry between the aging Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore, so the romance here is ice-cold. Grant does have a few comic moments as a washed up 80s pop singer, thanks to the script. But Barrymore is given nothing funny to say whatsoever. The twirpy pop star who wants them to write a song for her is the best thing in the movie. If you need to turn your mind off completely, this is a good candidate to watch."
4,Just plain fun,"Not usually a great fan of romantic comedies, but I actually watched this one twice on the same rental -- mostly because I wanted to figure out why I enjoyed it so much more than others of its genre. The verdict: 1)both lead characters are so vulnerable and endearing, and 2)everyone's just having so much FUN -- the songwriters, the concert-goers, the sister (what a kick!!) and most of all me. Sure it's formula, but so what -- it made me chuckle a little, smile a lot, and remember that even when it seems like the best part of life is behind you, there still may be a surprise or two in store. This one'll never change the world, but it sure helped brighten my evening."
2,"Definitely, I did not like it","I was not my kind of romantic comedy. I did not feel a connection between the main characters and that made it hard to like the script. Although Drew Barrimore was great, the rest of the cast were not."
4,Music and Lyrics,"Enjoyable romantic comedy. The chemistry was good between the 2 actors and they did a good job. I thought the movie was well paced, very likable and easy to watch. I recommend it."
2,Thus have the mighty fallen...,"Hugh Grant is arguably one of the most endearing romantic leads who has ever graced the silver screen--sweet, tender, vulnerable, and, unfortunately, aging. Pairing him up with the witless Drew Barrymore didn't help this fallen angel one bit. He is still getting on in years, and it shows. Drew Barrymore's lack of talent also shows. But, when you consider how vapid the plot of this movie was, and how awful the writing, you really can't hold Music and Lyrics against either one of them. The saddest part is that the man who played Chopin so admirably in Impromptu had to come to this ignoble end."
3,Music and Lyrics,"I had high hopes for this movie but found it slow at times and disappointing. Although it was not a total flop, I must say I expected must more. Our friend is a big Hugh Grant fan and was disaapointed as well."
3,You better like Hugh Grant...,"This is a very cute movie about a mythical 80's performer (think WHAM! or Men without hats, etc.) who is still out there plugging along and trying to get back into the spotlight without his lyricist.There are some very interesting scenes, like the Bernie-Taupin-meets-stud-flesh lyricist, the buddhist-sex-goddess-rap-blondie and her entourage, and then the scene where he records his song in a couple of hours on his home system. Wow! to have that kind of talent to play all of those instruments 'just like that' and pop out a demo in no time! yuh!The love interest is properly offhanded and consumed in 'unimportant' pursuits to repeatedly ignore the monster opportunity lying in front of her, so we all respect her the morning after.I am not so sure about the finale, but there are a lot of lights and things!...and Love...*** should do it-Chris"
1,broke after couple of uses,"I was so exited when I bought this car for my son1. it stunk so bad2. was very hard to pedal3. broke after couple of uses4. keep the box, I am trying to send it back and can not find the right boxjust pain in the behind over all"
2,Poor quality,"This product unfortunately looks very cheaply made once it arrives. It is only battery powered and does not last long. I order 2 and 1 of them arrived broken into several pieces. The company was easy to work with and helpful in refunding my money including shipping, but I was not happy with the product overall."
1,"If you want to learn how to make meetings work & save money/time, don't read this","With more than 5 years of successful leadership experience when it comes to running meetings, my fellow board-members and I were advised to read this in order to improve our meeting efficiency and team work skills. This was a complete waste of time. The only helpful tips in this book were to have a set a agenda before each meeting send out to all group members and to have the group create 1 list of public notes for the entire group without any names listed. Everything else suggested brought down meeting efficiency."
5,the best book of meeting,"Not only introduced a win/win mode meeting, It also give many details to tell us how to manage the skill and where the traps lied.In a word, it's the best of this type I ever read."
2,Cheap copy of original Cheap Trick Album.,"Not as clean as you would expect from a remix, which was disappointing. The song, ""I want you to want me"" totally blows on this copy. The popular version is not on this CD. Instead, they inserted an ""early version"" of this tune. You would not even recognize it if you didn't know you had the CD in your player."
3,"Complete, but poor quality","I have been learning some ragtime and wanted to hear more to find other selections to learn. Listened to Maple Leaf Rag, my favorite, first and was disappointed. Listened to others and was more disappointed. Maple flies - much faster than anyone would play it, you can't make out some of the phrases. And talk about ad libs - Tempo, dynamics, embelishments, nuances - I really think he plays some wrong notes too because he's going so fast. It's really a poor recording - and that's just on Maple Leaf. Others with ""intros"" start quick and then there's a grand pause, not a rest, but nearly a five second break. It's hard to argue how Joplin would have played it, but this is hardly anything I want to try to imitate. The only qualitating factor is the number of songs for the price. A lot of variety of a poor interpretation is only worth 3 stars. if that. Look for Rifkin or a copy that is as written to listen to first, then go for the ad libs and ""artistic interpretations"""
5,God is Good,My children adore these videos. The music sends them the most important message inlife! I love listening to it in the background even when I can't see the TV screen... Thesesongs/videos are among few today that have a healthy message.
3,"Ok, but I would buy in store","This handles are fine. I bought these and the Avent spouts so I can use my bottles as sippy cups. They are a little stiffer than I expected, and colors definitely vary. I have a boy, and received pink. Next time I'll simply go to the store to buy."
3,Colors should not vary...,I hate the fact that we can't choose the color of the handles. If only all colors were neutral... but they are not! I got a pink one for my son! Other than that it's ok and works well with the avent bottles.
1,DON'T GET IT,"This collection may seem enticing to someone who would like to become familiar with classical music without spending a lot of money. I bought this many years ago before I knew a whole lot about classical music, for the price. The Beethoven symphonies will provide you with a lifetime of musical enjoyment and appreciation. Get one of the best collections available: Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra."
4,Helpful to new Shakespeare teachers,"If you are reasonably new to teaching Shakespeare this book has some good ideas to liven up your class.It breaks down the activities into different acts, and it uses approaches that will appeal to different learning styles. There are a number of useful activities, worksheets, and practices quizzes that will get you up and rolling. When a new teacher is stuck, this is one of the books that I loan them.For the experienced teacher, or someone who considers themself well-versed in Shakespeare, this book is a little elementary. It functions great in support, but lacks a little all on its own. I do however find it useful in conjunction with books like Shakespeare Set Free."
4,WTF,"I wanted an album with Maurice Ravel, and they slap on the second CD with Claude Debussy? I have an entire other CD for meant for that, Its called a Debussy album."
3,hot tools,"The flat iron doesn't get hot enough in my opinion, and the surface area is too small. It should be recommended for people with thin or short hair only. They dryer is okay, but I expected a lot more from the online description. The bag is cheap and I could have definitely done without it. All in all I was a bit disappointed with the product because I expected more from the brand's reputation."
2,fans dont deserve this...,Well i have never seen this show.so i bought it more for fred (herman).so i bought it.and first i had read the reviews and couldnt believe it.how everyone was writtn bad reviews.anyways when i got this yesterday i open it and to take the disc out was a mission you would have to becareful not to break the disc.thats how bad it is to take it out.and on top of that all episodes are mixed and not in order.youd be better off buying it on ioffer with all episodes in order and great case.which is what i shouldve done.so buyers beware
4,Car 54 review,I received my DVD last week and watched it all. The show itself is great however I noticed they could not be in the right order as well. You have Charlote Raye plaing a bank teller after being Leo's wife and Leo (Al Lewis) playing a construction foreman after being seen as Leo. The packaging is something I have never seen in the 300+ dvd's I own.The show itself is so good though I can't wait for season 2 to come out. Look at the bright side. They screwed this up so much maybe it will be worth something someday.
3,Good show but episodes are in random order,"I remember this show from when I was a child, and to this day still love it. Imagine my pleasure when this series was released on DVD. I got the series in today (fast delivery by the way) and was sorely disappointed to discover the episodes are in random order, not production order nor broadcast order. Although the quality of the reproduction is very good, there are still a few flaws, but that's to be expected. If I'd known about the random episode order ahead of time, it'd probably have been a deal breaker. Wish I could have rated 2-1/2 stars. Most likely this set will be going back."
2,Not my style,"I bought this album based on the appearence of several bands that I have on other albums and compilations of modern surf bands, including the ""SURFIN' SENORITA"" compilation album that was also put out by Wildebeest Records. That cd was EXCELLENT, BUT THIS ONE IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT. There are great songs by Tiki Tones, Los Banditos, Sandblasters, and Cocktail Preachers. The rest, however, range from mediocre to downright annoying--one of them being nearly never-ending (8+ minute song). If instrumental ""soul"" music is really your thing then you may like it. I can't recommend it."
3,"Enjoyable, and oh so true","While the title was slightly misleading, it took nothing away from the story and the characters. I loved the fact that the book didn't give you an obvious ending. The characters were belivable. It was great to see black-on-black snobbery addressed in this way providing amusing anecdotes."
1,No wonder,"I haven't bought this book, just skimmed a few pages at the local book store. I did so because I was curious about what Pat Jones would write about. I knew her personally and was not surprised she was writing about passing. She's always had a problem with those of us who were not darked skinned and did everything she could do to ""pass"" as she grew up. She was phony and had the strangest family of misfits. This sounds like a biography. I am glad to hear that she has a life because her cancer caused her a lot of grief when she was 16. I hope she decides to write something different the next time although I don't know if it will be possible since I hear she is still color struck with her near white husband. Let's pray she finds peace and uses her limited talent for some other kind of therapy."
5,Excellent read,"Patricia has a jones for writing. This was an excellent, well-formed story about class. You always know about these certain types, but I know that I've never been subjected to it, and Ms. Jones made it very clear. Whether it was a tad-bit exaggerated or right on the mark, I loved it. A lot of people say the title is misleading, but I don't think it was. The word passing can have many different meanings, we just decided to go with the most obvious. After reading the book, you found that Eulelie wasn't passing for white, yet she was passing off as something she was not and bread her children in the way she transformed, so in actuality, the title fit perfectly. This made me think in a bigger realm of our world and how racism and things of the sort are ""passed"" down to children who don't know otherwise, except from what they over-hear or were taught. This book was great because it makes you wonder who's who, and if who you think they are really is who they are. (Did that make sense :)"
4,Great Monitor,"I just purchased this at a Home Depot for, get this $169. It was on close out. I just got the last of 3 remaining. I thought I would have to get a new video card but didn't. It loaded easy and works perfect. This is a wide screen but for now the picture does not fill in completly. I have a black margin left & right about 1"" or so. I have not hooked it up to a TV, I'm just enjoying it off the 10 yr. old Gateway CP. Keep your eye out if this goes on close out. It was not advertised just sitting up in front of the store. So you never know!!"
3,"First of all, I have to say that ...","First of all, I have to say that I love Kiss My Face products, and this was no exception. I love the fact that they use natural ingredients in their products. Both my husband and I tried out this foam bath. He used it as a body wash, and I used it as a foam bath. He works out a lot and always has sore muscles. He noticed that it helped out a little, but he still needed to use a sports cream rub after his shower. I was amazed at how much foam and lather came from such a small amount. I didn't, however, like the smell very much. It does smell mediciney. The good thing is that the smell doesn't linger on my body after the bath."
5,Sick! Bent! Painful to watch!,"Yet curiously lovable. ""Three Stooges"" for the new millenium...except that there are only two."
4,Great little bag,"This is a great little travel bag for compact video or digital cameras. Just enough room for the camera and a battery charger. Several pockets hold memory cards and batteries as well as a slim tabletop tripod. Very convenient size and weight that makes it perfect for walking tours, etc. An SLR and lens would be a very tight fit if possible at all."
3,new old material,"eh...pretty much in the same vein as the Warriors release..featuring already familar songs in demo , live , alternate recordings. Decent only because it's Blitz and they truly have addictive and catchy Oi! songs..buy it if you want it"
4,"At first, I thought the product was too ...","At first, I thought the product was too thin. After using it for a few days though, I got used to the consistency and I think it works as well as the gel I had been using. The mint smell is a little too strong for my taste, but other than that, I liked it pretty well. I would buy it again."
2,Save your money for live singing lessons,"After trying this book, I am convinced that nothing compares to live singing lessons. Although chapters are written fluidly and are an easy read, real singing improvement after finishing seems minimal compared with the effort."
2,M1 booklet,The booklet was just OK The price delivered was horrendous. The book was 6.99 and over $40 delivered. The postage stamp read $1.20 Someones getting ripped and I think its me . R.Kendall
2,Good for bubble gummers,"Honestly, Shania is a beautiful woman, but that's as far as it goes. She lacks vocal range and you can hear it when the back up singers carry her inability to hit certain notes. This song has a fun beat, but the target market is musically narrow minded. A producer genius for a husband, good marketing and a savvy to bridge the Pop/Country gap add to her popularity. But when the cookie crumbles, musical ability is mediocre at best. She's just another pretty face, and that don't impress me much."
1,Country,"Yeah, this is country... and that's where it needs to stay. It's a shame that foreign listeners have to endure this."
2,What Happened?,"I love masamune shirow!I loved intron depot 1-3!This one is just not up to par, mostly character sketches and tiny headshots of characters. Get this only if you're a die hard shirow fan. Everybody else save your cash and wait for ""Exon Depot""."
4,Bought it for cleaning my Sig Bottles,I heard from other reviews and friends that using these tabs to refresh Sig bottles is a cheap alternative to the Sig tablets.They were right.
5,Superior item at a super price!,The items in this all-in-one set for the nursery appear to be well made! A huge plus are easy to grip handles for mom or dad to manipulate during bath time with a wiggly little person!
5,Great for Traveling!,"This is a fantastic kit to give any new parent. A friend of mine just had a kid and received this as a gift. They've been keeping this in the car for when they're visiting or just out and about. It's got all the essentials, including the ones you might not think to pack."
3,It was okay...,"Like I said, it was okay...nothing to get too excited over. The only thing that really got me about this kit is the thing for the nose is WAY too hard so we threw it away and used the one the hospital gave us. I don't have a clue why they made it that hard. Feels like they mixed cement in with plastic!! Almost impossible to even SQUEEZE without some muscle!"
2,Ehh.,I probably would have gotten better quality if i would have bought a kit for the same price at Walmart.
1,never recieve,"I ordered this like over a month ago, and still hasn't been sented out.. I wonder why? Im still waiting to hear back when they would send it out"
1,Received in pieces!,"Received the product quickly but was unusable. Package contained two. One was cracked in many pieces and crumbled in my hand. The other was badly chipped. I decided not to return as the cost to repackage, take to post office and pay to ship would probably be more than item cost. So, they are in trash. I wasted my money....don't waste yours!"
3,"Love the writing, the recipes need work","I love Nigella's writing in this book, and the pictures are mouthwatering. I love reading cookbooks in general, and hers in particular. It makes me want to try every recipe. However when I did try her recipes, they were less than successful. I've tried 7 dessert recipes (and I'm not a novice baker) and only one was successful (almond danish), although it took forever to make. I also made: almond cake (ok), Boston cream pie (cream was runny, cake had ""no flavor"" according to husband), chocolate loaf cake (completely unbaked in center), chocolate cherry cupcakes (just not sweet enough for me), Granny Boyd's cookies (awful, not chocolatey at all, and a strange dry consistency), PB squares (I think the chocolate overpowered the peanut butter, and they were hard to get out of the pan).I am so disappointed by this book."
3,Inspiring... but the recipes could have used more testing!,"I've tried quite a few of recipes and have made some more than once. They are not terribly clear and if one hasn't any baking experience, disaster could ensue. The lime pound cake is simply terrible. The cranberry cake is excellent. The recipes remind me a lot of Martha Stewart recipes; they sound good but are not at all reliable."
5,domestic goddess isn't what you think,"At first I thought Lawson was referring to some 50s TV housewife with her title, and I was happily proven wrong on the very first page. This book is a delight from word go, and the recipes I've tried so far--a rhubarb cordial and a batch of cupcakes--have been excellent. Lawson's writing shows plenty of wit and intelligence, but there's a warm sense of causualness in the pre-recipe notes that makes me feel I'm jotting down kitchen tips from a hip friend. While simplifying the art of baking tremendously, she also manages to infest a baker (or wannabe) with a terrific sense of accomplishment and pleasure. Not only do I plan on eventually trying every recipe in the book (they all sound so good!), but I have every intention of buying a copy for every baker I know."
3,I love Nigella....,And have used several of the recipes in the book without any problems. I am culinary school trained and find her recipes both creative and tasty. I think it is def worth a second try if you have had issues....
5,happy dog lady,i purchased one of these at the dicks five and dime in branson several years ago. still like new and really comes in handy when you have burned on gunk. i just purchased 11 of these for stocking stuffers for the ladies at Christmas. Would highly recommend for nice tuck in gift for shower or christmas.
2,exactly as advertised but.......,it tarnished after only 6 months of owning it which made it look awful even if it was exactly as advertised when I first got it.
2,Cover/ Demo CD for two unknown bands.,"Kinda disappointed after buying this cd, listening to some hoky cover band play these tunes. I was expecting the original artist. This should be pointed out on the listing."
1,Stinky,"Not only does it not work, but it smells terrible. Like a dark, wet cave. I guess that's the ""liquid rock""...but where's the patchouli? I'd rather smell like B.O. than this stuff. Yuck."
2,Mine are not lasting anywhere near 8000 hours,"Purchased three of these bulbs, rated at 8000 hours life. In my application, they are on no more than 4 hours per day. One lasted less than one year and was replaced under warranty. Now a second has failed at about a year and a half and no more than 2000 hours. Seller says I must have bad luck. In my world 2 out of 3 is not bad luck, but more likely bad product."
4,Classic Lubitsch title,"It took me a couple of viewing before I really enjoyed this musical. Very offbeat for Grable and the film flopped at the box office. The film has some beautiful songs. Was surprised at FOX's MOD release. The colors looked quite good and no complaints about the audio. Now if only FOX would release THE SHOCKING MISS PILGRIM, which also stars Grable."
5,Betty Grable Showcase for Her Talents,"Actually, I really liked this movie, and it displayed so many of Betty Grable's talents in a variety of manners and scenes. I bought it and loved it!"
3,My Fair Grable,"Always a Grable fan, so I check everything out. This was a flop in 1948, but there are some good songs. I was hoping that Fox would restore some music. If they have lost the footage, they could have added the audio to Betty`s ""There`s Something About Midnight"". I don`t think they even look for anything. From the looks of some of the releases, I pretty sure that not only do they not know what they have in the vault, but they don`t even care. I think they pretty much hate movies, but love money."
3,Not too shabby,"This ain't bad, but it ain't nothin special, he has a lot of phat piano backrounds, but there are too many slow songs, there are a few good songs, like Ghetto Godzilla and money don't make me. But other than that, this isn't very impressive. This doesn't even sound like rap most of the time, it sounds like R&B. Thats how slow it is."
5,Anti Aging Treatment,"My doctor is giving me and to my family this product to mak emy body produce all the hormones we need, is really good this product"
3,Any Dispatches from Central Asia Welcome,"Tamelane's Children is an interesting collection of snapshots of life in this fascinating part of the world. As a former Peace Corps volunteer who spent three years in Uzbekistan, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It brought back many memories.If I have any caveats, they have to do with the apparent willingness of the author to take the pronouncements of the repressive Uzbek regime as truth. The real truth of life in Uzbekistan requires more investigation than this book provides."
3,Silvana Pfeffer from Uruguay,"This book has changed my life in a positive way: It has given me more enjoyment, better communication with my relatives and friends alike and I would strongly recommend it to whoever wishes to gain self esteem."
5,Seven Spiritual Laws of Success: A Practical Guide to the Fullfillment of Your Dreams,Spiritual Laws - not necessarily based on religion. Things we should all follow through on every day of our lives. What a nice world it would be.
1,who is this guy?,"What a lot of mass-marketed, spiritual-sounding, sugar-coated platitudes. You're better off writing your own laws of success. Don't miss his bestseller SELLING YOUR SOUL FOR FUN AND PROFIT."
5,ONCE YOU READ IT.... WORDS ARE NEEDEDLESS,"TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:THIS BOOK IS LIKE A HOLY BOOK FOR ME AND MY LIFE...WITH THIS ON MY LIFE, ANY CRITCICISM (BAD) OR GOOD IS WELL TAKEN AND WITH THE APPROPIATE MEASURES TO USE THE BEST AND DISCARD THE BAD.THE COMPANIES AMAZON USES TO DEAL WITH THEM ARE THE BEST AND ABOVE ALL PROFESSIONAL AND RESPONSIBLE.I WOULD RECCOMEND ANYONE TO USE THIS SITE, KNOWING YOUR CREDIT INFORMATION IS SECURED AND WELL HANDLED.THANKS!X ANGEL BLANCO"
5,wonderful,"This book was a wonderful read. i enjoyed it very much, it was small and i read it quickly... but the words were extremely powerful and i always remember them and remember to live by them. I highly recommend everyone to read it."
5,Great CD's...,"The information on these CD's...can be life changing. If, you apply what Dr. Chopra shares with you. I have the book of the same title...but I like the CD's better."
1,Probably.............................,Yes what deepak says is probably good.....but how about making it less complicated then it really is? I find the text hypocritical in parts especially when knowing how much Deepak's treatment centres and seminars cost.
1,Horrible,Utterly senseless. I wish I could give it 0 star. I was so disgusted that I dumped this book in trash as soon as I finished reading it. People like Chopra disgust me.
1,The worst Mary R. Rinehart ?,"I'm usually a great fan of Mary R. Rinehart, but this book is bad, and disappointing. It's hard to read from the first chapter, there seems to be non link between following phrases. Is it because, for once, the narrator is a man instead of a girl ? I gave up after twenty pages! Very far below her bests, ""The swimming pool"" and ""The great mistake"" or the ""yellow room""."
4,Very Thin,"I got a good deal, and I am not complaining....yet. It works fine, but looks like it will fall apart in a few months..........the cable is painfully skinny...anorexic almost. Don't skip rope with this one!Well, I've had it for over a year now......no problems of any kind. It sure is skinny, tho!"
1,The Leaking Fountain,This product worked well for about one full month before he started to not work anymore and the thing would leak onto the floor. I made sure to clean it very well but still it only worked for one month.
2,Falsely advertised capacity,"I bought this fountain because it is advertised to hold 6L / 216 oz. It does not. This fountain, when filled per the manufacturer's recommendations to 1/2 inch below the rim, only holds ~160 oz. In this state, it is still possible to move it from the sink to the floor with minimal spilling. If you fill it on the floor, and fill it to the very rim (including the clear reservoir and the top fountain reservoir), the fountain maxes out at ~190 oz, anymore and it promptly spills over the edge. That's only ~5 L. I called this to Petmate's attention, who did nothing... I even offered to send them a video demonstrating this and they ignored it. If you buy this thinking it holds what they say, be forewarned that it does not."
5,primosounds,i like this cd very much the sounds are mellow and its the best to listen to when you feel like chilling out.My favourite song would have to be glory box its spacey sound always put me in crazy mood wihch is my favourite kind.they sound o.k recorded but i like them live better so yeah i think they rule and every one should should have a copy of NYClive.
3,You won't find an album like this often.,"Portishead grows on you the minute ""Cowboys"" runs its course. A very different sound keeps the listener intrigued throughout, and the lead vocals are almost spook-ily good. Buy it!"
4,Astounding,"I wasn't a huge Portishead fan, but I could recognize Beth's voice. When I heard this version of Strangers it nearly blew my mind. It may sound crazy, but if you ever have given any ELO with the London Orchestra a chance, you'll appreciate the contribution such instruments make."
4,I really liked this product. It soaked in ...,"I really liked this product. It soaked in well and didn't have a smell like perfume to it. Being a guy, I liked it a lot for this particular reason. The one thing that I didn't like about it is that it burned my face. Other lotions do this as well, especially just after I shave, but this particular one really seemed to sting -- that's why I'm giving it four stars. For other parts of your body, however, it works wonderfully."
4,Blue is bored,"Steve is on the phone (and never appears in the book). Everyone is busy. Blue is bored. She sees what everyone else is doing and tries doing the activities herself, and ultimately discovers what it is she really wants to do. Typical, colorful, all the animated characters are here. Nicely done."
3,Good story,My two year old loved this book! We wore out the pages reading it over and over again. Now my son is coloring and trying to draw a story too.
5,great for those with sensitive skin,I'd recomend this shaving cream to anyone with sensitive skin. I have skin allergies to scented products and this shaving cream was true to the fragrance free claim. A little goes a long way and the bottle has lasted much longer than I originally expected. The Kiss my Face brand is Eco Friendly and does not test on animals. Overall a great product and company.
5,Good book for newcomers to party plan selling,"I liked this book because it helped me get started in a new business. It covered the basics and helped me choose my company. I liked the ideas for setting up parties and working with the hostess, too. Maybe somebody already doing party plan selling may find this too basic, but I found it just right for me.Roberta Ellison"
5,Review after vIsit to Uganda -book from amazon,I visited a friend living in Uganda who recommended this book. The author combines a comprehensive analysis of the underlying situation and survivors' personal anecdotes to convey how this genocide could occur and how the world could let it happen.
3,"A gripping polemic, but misses the hearts of the people.","Although the title of the book indicates the author will describe the stories of the people of Rwanda, we learn little about the lives of the victims or perpetrators in this historical and political account of the Rwandan genocide. The author supports his view that the world stood by, passively and sometimes actively supporting the Hutu Power murderers. However, his interviews and accounts are almost exclusively with well-to-do and politically powerful individuals. As such, I'm not sure that our understanding of the culture and other forces which lead to the blind obedience to murder and, at times, be murdered, is increased."
5,Received extremely fast!,"Very pleased with the fast service, would certainly order from again! Thanks very much!"
2,Unrelieved Hopelessness,"I'm a big fan of The Brothers but I was sorry I watched No Country for Old Men. Blood Simple had incredible atmosphere and a perfect, clever story; O Brother, Where Art Thou had humor and heart, as did Fargo. This film, as well-made as it was, simply became another candidate on my ongoing list of Most Depressing Movie Ever. Add the animal body count to the human, and I was really ready for a ""Seinfeld"" rerun by the end of the DVD. I find it ironic that the brilliant Coen team should get an Oscar for this one, and that every major critic's review I read was so worshipful. It was, as another Amazon reviewer put it, nihilistic; that's considered hip, I guess. I've been reduced to tears by many a cinematic experience but this was different, a movie so dominated by hopelessness and ugliness that (for me personally), the humanity of some of the characters didn't have much chance to make an impact."
1,This Movie Won The Best Oscar??? The Academy Is Nuts!!!,"This has got to be the worst best movie Oscar ever!!! If all you care to see is a psychopathic killer (how in God's name did this guy when the best actor???) on the rampage, then this movie is for you. On top of that, the movie has one of the worst endings ever where everything in the movie is left up in the air. It doesn't even deserve one star."
1,Total Lameness,This film has Academy Award written all over it. And by that I mean that it pretty much sucked. Reading even the positive reviews of this movie and they all admit that the story is lacking and the ending is weak/non-existent/stupid take your pick.Unfortunately telling a story is the whole point of a movie. So if the story is not there the rest of the fluff does not really matter.
4,Not for everyone,"I enjoyed this movie, although I fully understand that this movie is not for everyone. It can be dark and intense at times (thanks to some great acting by Bardem) but that's one of the reasons I like this movie. The direction the story goes during this movie is unpredictable at times and makes you pay attention. Tommy Lee Jones does a fine job, as does Brolin. If you want a dark, gritty, unpredictable, finely acted movie then I highly recommend this."
4,Wow,"I'm honestly stumped on this one. This movie has many parallels to ""Fargo"" in its representation of stereotypical characters ""the small town Sheriff"", ""the emotionless hitman"", ""the uneducated blue collar worker"", they are all represented here and as for violence, well there is plenty. There wasn't much in the film I could relate to obviously, but I will say I couldn't turn away. I watched every moment of it to the end and was indeed engrossed and I'm not sure if it was because the lead character was so bizarre he was interesting or because the movie is so unpredictable. You are sure of one thing while watching it: anything can happen in this film and does. If you're looking for a thoughtful film that leaves you feeling enlightened, this isn't it, but if you like films that sit just left of center you will enjoy it."
2,What masterpiece?,"I saw this film with high expectations due to the all the praises I've heard lavished on it. What a let down. Sorry, but it is totally predictable and tries to make up for the well used story line with unique weapons for the graphic violence. What sort of hitman/killer is going to drag around a compressed air tank? The ending was an absolute let down. No one wants to see the bad guy get away, what after so many killings including the lead fellow's innocent wife. This movie actually pissed me off, which I won't normally write in a review. The bad guy deserved to get it in the end and did not."
5,Great Movie... Blu-ray is alright,"I love this movie. Great story and great performances. I am not sure how much the blu-ray adds to the experience, but Amazon's price for the blu-ray is not bad. Still, an up-scaled DVD copy would probably look 9/10ths as good. This movie is one to buy (either format)."
1,"Long, boring, and pointless",I don't understand the attraction to this movie. Perhaps I didn't watch it deep enough... It just didn't seem to ever go anywhere or have any purpose. I know some people love it and others hate it. I'm in the hate it camp. Sorry to those who love it.
2,I dont git it,"Waste of time and money to see a movie that you have to be Frued to make your own ending. Not the best movie of the year in my mind. should be called ""No ending for all men""Soory i just didnt like it."
4,Some Fresh Air,In a world where every movie seems to be a re-make of some sort this movie provides a fresh story of its own. Many will probably be annoyed with the lack of closure at the end of the film but in my opinion it adds to the mystic of the story.
3,A coin toss either way...,"I could go in to a long review of this film, however I believe short and to the point would be better. The acting as advertised is first rate. Bardem is the prototypical stone killer. No emotion, no sentiment. Tommy Lee Jones is the sherrif who knows he is in over his head and frustrated knowing he can't prevent what's coming. Brolin is fine in his role and Harrelson plays his part well. All the pieces are well crafted, but not all of the pieces are present for a complete puzzle. The movie has a very unsatisfying ending in my opinion. Way too many unanswered questions. The logic within the movie is flawed at several points - not the actors fault. The film did drag at a couple of points and as mentioned there were too many coincidental situations for my liking. I'd like to have seen this remade with a tighter script and better ending."
4,Takes its time,"I once tried to get through one of Cormac McCarthy's books, but found it so bleak and slow-moving I couldn't do it. So I have no problem believeing that this Coen brothers treatment punches up the book which spawned the movie more than a little. Still, it takes a while to unfold, which the movie ultimatley pulls off (barely) with subtle humor and good performances. The character of the local law enforcement official played by Tommy Lee Jones has more than a few similarities to Frances McDomrmand's character in ""Fargo."" Well done all around."
1,The Worst Coen Brothers Movie Ever,"The Coen Brothers make 2 types of films: deeply symbolic humorous parables, and local-color humor-tinged melodramas. ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" fall into the former category, while ""Fargo"" and ""No Country For Old Men"" fall into the latter. Unlike ""Fargo"", however, the plot of ""No Country..."" lacks any cohesion other than authentic-sounding local-color dialogue and it's excellent delivery by the film's performers -- all of which is ultimately meaningless, in the absence of a larger narrative context. Yes, the Bros.' fine production values are also well-displayed here, but overall this film feels like an empty exercise in attempting to recapture their previous brilliance."
3,Mixed emotions,"A difficult movie to review. Through 80-90 percent of it I thought it was one of the most powerful and moving films I'd seen. Also had a lot of subtle humor. Beautiful acting and cinematography, and never clichÃ©d.But then it ended in not one of the many possible endings you could have imagined for the story, and it felt very unsatisfactory. To me at least. Pissed me off. I thought that was unnecessary, I don't know what the point was. It was like somebody putting out a delicious desert after an excellent meal, and then taking the desert away after you'd had one bite."
1,waste of money,the only positive thing about this movie was javier bardem...the rest of the movie was a waste of $5..the ending was the worst ending for a academy award movie i ever saw...there's so many questions you'll be asking yourself about this movie after watching it..it only shows the quality of movies has diminished greatly the last few years if this movie was voted in..don't waste your money wait for it to come out on cable..whats the point of watching a movie if your going to leave scratching your head after its over
1,"Terrible, Terrible","This was the most horrible, depressing movie. The only reason I finished this movie was to try and figure out why the movie has the name that it does. I don't believe that it was so ""deep"" that I couldn't figure it out. I just think it was a movie about a lot of senseless, brutal killing. I just could not believe it got the academy award for best picture of the year. It in no way deserved it in my opinion. It did have some good acting, but for what? It was senseless. If you compare this movie to others throughout the years that have won the best picture awards, this was a pitiful, pitiful choice. It definitely is not for young people, and not for people who have a problem with depression."
1,Worst movie ever,"If I could give this movie less than one star I would. There is no plot, no motive, no theme, no climax, no resolution, no nothing. I have never seen a worse movie in my entire life.This is simply about gratuitous murder. That is all. Hollywood and the media's love of this movie is pure hype. This is proven by the fact that it was out on DVD immediately, even while it was still in the theaters. Obviously there is a mismatch between the hype and reality.Buying this movie would go down as your worst purchase ever!"
1,Senseless killing made into a movie,"From all the reviews about how great this movie was I made the popcorn and sat down to watch the one movie I would not recommend to anyone!Senseless killing made into a movie!The main character in this movie kills people on his own agenda. Doesn't need a reason, doesn't care. Kills people that stop to help him, kills people on a principal, his own that is. If you enjoy killing without purpose than you will love this movie. Even the big shoot em up and blow em up movies have killing with a purpose.This is the only movie in years I lost sleep over. Has it come to the point where filmmakers can't do any better than this? It is just this kind of movie that contributes to the attitude our kids are getting about life in general.This movie would get less than one star if I could do that."
2,Misfire,"I saw this film because it had won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and I wanted to see what it was that the Academy found so admirable.Well, it's two hours and countless bodies later, and I still don't know what the Academy found so admirable. I think the Academy mis-fired severely, here (no pun)."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"I thought it would be pretty good after I heard that it won an academy award, but I was wrong. Reminds me of Fargo which I didn't like either. Save your money on this one."
2,What is wrong with this world!,Is this what America is coming to?! The violence is over the top in this movie and a cattle gun should never be owned by an individual much less glammerized in a movie. With this movie applauded as a sensational piece of art; no wonder our children and other young people are out there killing each other. Can't we see anything that puts a smile on our face just once in awhile.
2,Good Acting...nothing else.,"If you buy this wanting only to study the acting of the exceptional cast, then you will be very pleased. If you have any concept that this will be a good movie...forget it. It has half a story, literally the story just sort of stops at the half way point. Despite what some reviews have said, not showing what happens to the main characters is not revolutionary story-telling. I know a lot of people don't want to say that this film sucked because the makers are well respected, but it sucked. If it had been made by an indy director it would be getting blasted hard by the same people now singing it's praises. Real life may end with people saying, ""Heck with it...I'll just retire"", but that's not an ending for any dramatic work."
2,Cliche violence,"In its attempt to shock, this movie, in typical Hollywood style, pushes beyond its own credibility and overshoots itself. Psychopaths invariably are neither a) intelligent - the protagonist almost outdoes Hannibal Lecter in his diabolically acute temporal/spatial judgement and absurdly enhanced tracking skills - nor are they courageous - I'm not sure that there are many people capable of performing major operations on themselves without anesthetics, but a common narcoterrorist - get away! Where's the motivation for this extreme behavior. Not money, not revenge, not anything. This character, looked at closely, is a giant vacuum, a chimera."
1,No Country for Old Men DVD,It was a well used disc that used to be an old Blockbuster rental. It also didn't have the 2nd disc with bonus features. Don't buy from this vendor.
2,Letdown,Perhaps I went into the movie expecting too much. Perhaps its just not that good. I am not sure. It has its moments but ultimately the unfounded violence gets boring.
3,Sick sick sick,"I'm at the point where I prefer reading about lives of the saints so this kind of creepiness is not my regular fare. However, the Coen brothers are so talented I have to check out what they produce and just close my eyes when I have to. Yup, they're even more compelling than ever and I did some serious squirming from the tension. I have always loved Tommy Lee and now love Josh Brolin - Javier . . . a great actor. I don't think it would have killed the Coens to smile when they accepted their awards -- might be time for them to start thinking about happy endings."
1,no country for intelligent life,"Sorry, but this movie is a bad joke. But, then, it is sooooo American. Kill em all.........."
3,Uneven,"In spite of great acting and taut filming, the movie disappoints in a number of ways. For those who had not first read the book, a great deal of the story line is puzzling, and for those who had read the book there is simply too many of the good things left out."
1,Worst. Movie. Ever.,"I wish I had some of what the Academy of Motion Pictures was smoking the day they voted this as Best Picture. I see in other reviews a lot of words being tossed around, crowing praises about this film: ""minimalist,"" ""thriller,"" ""classic,"" ""bone-chilling,"" and ""masterpiece."" I heartily disagree. As much as I love movies, as many as I have seen, this is hands down the most pointless, heartless, meandering, and senselessly violent movie ever turned out of Hollywood.People who say they understand this film, were excited by it, loved it or whatever strike me as the same folks who praised the Emperor's new clothes as he paraded around naked.Save your money. This is not even worth a one-time rental. It will leave you depressed and disturbed. If there is a message in the movie, it is that life is a random crapshoot in which you cannot escape your fate, that no one will be spared, and that evil will win in the end."
5,No Country for Old Men,Great movie. Looks like it is set up for a sequel. Ended a little prematurely I thought. Have watched several times and I will probably watch again before too long. DVD quality was good as well.

5,I not a fan of gore but I loved this movie,"I'm not saying this movie didn't have some rough scenes in it but they just didn't bother me and I'm the biggest wuss ever! I absolutely loved this movie. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and couldn't wait to see what happened next. There hasn't been a movie of this caliber in a long time for me. I plan on buying this movie to have in my collection. Fantastic, clever, superb story. Love it!!"
5,For the Oscar,"I can't believe Javier Bardem wasn't the first on the credits, 'cause his character is the most important in the story.-- SPOILERS --Also is the only character on screen with real presence. There are moments that you feel the stress just to be waiting for Bardem to appear and kill.This is a stunning Bardem performance. Forget Tommy Lee Jones, his character is useless in this movies, I didn't understand the nature of his character.Let's not talk about Brolin, OMG, talking about a bad actor."
1,stupid,"This is the dumbest idea ever. I am one of the biggest muppet fans out there, and at first I thought well I have to get it but no I'm done either I get season 4 or I'll never have it. Not this way, and beleive me it will hurt. there are very few things in this world that make me laugh and smile, and Jim Hensons stuff is one of them. And I would love to share this with my kids. I loved this growing up and my kids love it now and to think I would have to pay 125.00 to finish it well that is just too much. I mean its bad enough that we wait over a year for the next season and now this. I bet if Jim was still alive this would never happen I hope they don't sell even one."
1,a horrible way to treat loyal fans,"if a separate season 4 dvd is not released, i will be outraged. this is ridiculous and blatant profiteering. loyal fans of fraggle rock and other jim henson fans such as my self who may have bought the other three seasons will have no way of completing the set without having to re-buy the first three!!! i am really upset that they would take advantage of their customers this way."
4,Fraggle Rock complete series,The extras are great. I love this show. It is wonderful to catch up on the episodes I missed as a kid.
1,What a letdown.,"I haven't thought of Fraggle Rock in twenty years until my Mother in law bought a copy of one of the dvds for my six year old son. It was quite a treat to watch my son instantly connect with a show I loved as a kid. Needless to say, I immediately jumped online to buy all of them. Then, I find these reviews and discover another corporate scam. Booooo!!!!In the interest of justice, albeit a small swipe at corporate greed, I'll be making a trip to the public library to share these wonderful programs with my son. I suppose I better hurry before that institution sells out so some greedy jerk can squeeze every penny possible out of a public already stretched to the limit. These bozos should watch an episode or two of Fraggle Rock and acquire some of the values espoused by their creator."
1,"Season 4, no buy.","I 've been waiting a year for season 4. I just can't believe they are only releasing only as a box set. I will not buy it. I also have season 1 -3, got them for my son who loves Fraggle Rock. Oh well to bad."
5,Jim Henson - we miss you!,"HBO aired this almost 30 years ago and it still rocks. My 2 yro watch this in my office at night while I work and whined down. First time she watched it she clapped to the intro and giggled. Enough said, its a hit!"
1,What the...!!!!!,"Okay i've been watching Fraggle Rock since i was little and started to buy the box set like everyone else. And Like everyone i'm ticked off, HIT just cancelled the release of the last TWO SEASONS of Fraggle Rock, so now they're force us to buy this box set to get the complete series this is a new low for them people. Don't Buy, Wait till seasons Four and Five are released on DVD! Let our Voices be heard!"
1,Finish the job.....,"Finish the job.....Release all seasons before you sell the complete, or atleast offer those of us with the seasons sets an option to buy the remainder a decent price.What a rip off."
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible",HIT! Entertainment should have to face some sort of legal action for this. It makes absolutley no sense unless they just hate money as well as their loyal fans for the past few years. We cared enough to keep a petition going for years to get Fraggle Rock on DVD and the fact that we are being punished because we bought the first three seasons individually is outrageous. Do they seriously expect to make more selling them only as box sets than as individuals?Please.....if you are at all a fan of the series or the legacy of Jim Henson DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
1,Wicked Greed,"Fraggle Rock is a charming fantasy underworld of puppets and music that has remained with me for over two decades. Each episode is a story that revels in wacky excitement, while also providing straightforward life lessons. Which is why I feel so upset that Hit Entertainment would blacken such a daydream of a series. The unavailable fourth installment standalone DVD is a mockery of the creator Jim Henson, and I for one will not insult his memory by buying such an effigy of outright greed.My review will remain at less than 1 star until a suitable standalone version of Season 4 is released on DVD to match the previously released three standalone Season DVD's."
1,I'll buy it when I get a $100 discount for turning in the first 3 seasons that I previously purchased.,"Fraggle Rock is an amazing series. There is nothing bad to say about it. This review would get 5 stars if it were for season 4 of the set. This release is disturbing. Fans petitions to get Fraggle Rock on DVD for YEARS (see the Fraggle Rock DVD Petition website) were finally heard with the first 3 seasons released, and now we don't get season 4 because HIT entertainment wants another $125 of our money in order to get the final season along with the 3 other seasons we ALREADY bought! HIT is a messed up studio. I wish they could be more like Bci / Eclipse with the release of the He-man and She-ra DVD boxed sets. I'll just go without Season 4. Apparently HIT has gotten enough use out of my money to screw around with its loyal customers..."
1,Absurd!,"I grew up with this show, it helped to make my childhood a happier place in a less than happy world. Leave it to greedy corporations to deny me my second childhood without paying a large price. I want season four now! I'm not going to pay for seasons I already own. Got it?!"
5,All Purpose,Just a great looking knife? Have already used it for multiple task including trimming braided and fire line fishing line. As sharp as can be
3,Not good lighting,"Hood as stated, however the type of bulb the hood takes is either pink, blue, or clear. The problem is the ""clear"" bulb is more like a weird orange instead of a white which distorts the fish colors and is very hot so it heats the tank up too much!"
1,Broke out in HORRIBLE RASH!,"It saddens me to write this review as I strongly support natural products. I purchased this bar soap from whole foods, as I do most of my beauty supplies. I use Kiss My Face body lotion and have had no problems. Unfortunately, Kiss My Face bar soap caused me to break out in the worst rash I have ever had. I developed bruises on my body from the uncontrollable itch, I could not get any relief! It took me a while to figure out it was my bar soap. I went to my dermatologist multiple times and they misdiagnosed me with scabies!! When that medicine did not work, they had me change my laundry detergent to unscented and switch to dove unscented bar soap. It was not until I was rash free for over a month, I reintroduced the kiss my face bar soap, and with in a few hours broke out in the same horrible rash. If you have sensitive skin, I would not purchase this soap! I'm writing this post because I don't want anyone else to have to suffer like I did :("
4,First Time User,"I just got done using this soap. So far I like it. The main thing i noticed is how SOFT my skin feels. It's like SILK. I've seen a lot of complaints about the smell, but it doesn't bother me. It's not too overpowering. It is slightly slimy though. I would recommended, especially for dry skinned people, luckily I dont have that problem. I love organic products so i'm hoping I will br writing nice things in the near future!"
3,Ok for beginners,"I found this book interesting, but no more than that.If have lack of experience and don't know basic procedures, you will find it able to solve your problems."
4,Kensington 33199 FM Transmitter/Charger,"Very happy with the transmitter, I've tried others in the past (more expensive too) and this, in my opinion, is better. The one feature I particularly like is how you can use any station, not just 3-8 presets."
5,"Extremely easy setup, Works great so far!","It took me about 2 seconds to get this up and running, and so far, I'm very, very happy with it. I have an '06 Toyota Corolla with a standard radio setup, and I would say that the sound quality is similar to the radio. It is a bit muted, but only slightly. A true audiophile might be disappointed with it at very high volumes (which my car radio isn't great for to begin with) but for someone like me who just wants to be able to take their music with them and charge their ipod batteries at the same time, it's great. Also, it's smaller than I expected. I would recommend it."
1,Kensington Digital FM TRansmitter,"The unit works fine, but is only useful if your DC power source is a straight shot down, allowing you to read the numbers on the transmitter. On my Explorer, the power source is on the left side of the passenger footwell, meaning that I have to get out of the car, open the passenger door, and crouch down low in order to see the numbers on the transmitter. Without a flexible head on the unit, it is not at all practical for a large number of situations."
4,digital transmitter 33199,this kensington 33199 digital transmitter works fine so far in the southern ca area .
4,Great Value,"After researching several other products that would allow me to connect my iPod to the radio I was immediately drawn in by the price. It's cheap but is it CHEAP? Not at all, this is a very good product.When I travel very far from home I have to find a different radio station to tune into because it gets a little staticky. However, there are three presets that allows for easy and smooth driving.I don't give it a five star rating because of the occasional static. However, compared to products that cost $30 more this is a great value!"
3,That's about as good as an FM Xmitter can do.,"Like millions of other people, I want to get the most out of my iPod. I bought this one because it is stands out as a positively reviewed item. However, driving around with my iPod hooked to it and using 88.3 or 88.5 megahertz as the carrier, I get strong blasts of local stations at various places around town. There are no FM stations locally here at those frequencies. I sat in the car one day and just went up the dial and retuned the Xmitter until I hit 97.7 and found there to be the least amount of noise coming through the speakers. I turned the iPod back on and drove around with this new frequency and lo and behold, I did not hear the periodic blasts of other stations coming through. Why 97.7? I dunno, it's a couple clicks away in each direction of stations, but for some reason, I get very minimal interference there."
3,Works OK,I wouldnt say this is the best or the worst transmitter. You will have static no matter what you do. If you dont want static your better off with a tape deck adaptor if you have a tape deck. I find this adaptor works ok but you get static here and there. Overall its an ok product.
2,Not so great,"This FM transmitter is not the ideal solution for playing your iPod through your car's stereo system. I live in an urban area with many FM radio stations. There's a lot of interference from those stations, no matter what FM setting you choose."
4,Good product but doesn't recharge IPOD nano,"The preset channels didn't work for my Nissan Xterra 2001. However, once I changed the frequency to 89.1 - there was no problem. No static and didn't have any receptions problems when I was driving around town.However, the Kensington doesn't recharge my IPOD which is an inconvienence. My IPOD is 4nd generation nano (don't know if that's the reason) And don't know if would recharge different IPOD or the Iphone.With that being said - I still would recommend this product. Good sound quality and no disruption. Ease of use.Also the price has been lowered for this product."
3,Ipod fm transmitter,"Product arrived loose, and the pieces apart. The seller was very conscientious, and even offered to refund the cost, but I was able to figure out how to put it back together, and it works just fine."
3,Track Listing,Track Listing1. Everybody (Radio Mix) 3:512. Everybody (4 On The Floor Mix) 6:123. Let Yourself Be Free 4:204. Everybody (First Edition) 3:53
5,Very Best Of Big Daddy Kane,"I have always been a huge fan of Kane since 1988 when he dropped his first album. He has always been my favorite rapper. His lyrical content, flow, style is top notch, and I am thrilled to own this CD! Its so great having all his hits on one Cd.I listened to it as soon as I got it, and it was GREAT! Thank you seller.If anyone is a Big Daddy Kane fan get this asap, you wont be sorry! I love it!LONG LIVE THE KANE!"
5,"If you want to walk on water, You've got to get out of the boat.","It was well put together, and it was very helpful in guiding us through the bible study itself. It was easy to understand. I would highly recommend this book and this study. It helped us to open up in discussion at great length."
2,Huh?,"I'm a huge MINI fan, otherwise I'd give this disk zero stars. This is the very essence of shabby production, with no menu and no chapters... NO CHAPTERS! The two races shown are on one large chapter, making any sort of navigation impossible. As for the race footage, it is acceptable, but certainly nothing that makes up for the other flaws of this release."
5,The Greatest Choir Ever!!!!,I remember the Tommies as a kid and now that I'm grown up they still sound incredible. I love the power of their voices blended together. I also loved how Rev. Milton Brunson chose the best lead vocalist in the world to deliver powerful gospel music. Gospel music is much like blues it is born out of experience. Even if you like rock and roll you will also love this choir. The TOMMIES FOREVER!!!!!
4,Where's the CD?,"This is a great book, full of inspiration and feel-good eye candy. It seems rather antiquated, though, to include lots of clip art that needs to be photocopied at a specified enlargement. To accomplish this copying, the book needs to be taken apart. Also, most home printers do not print on paper larger than 8.5 by 11 inches, so some images are cut off while others are being enlarged. Why not just include all the images on a CD (that costs, what, about 25 cents to produce?) Most of the other books in this genre seem to be including CDs now. That's my only problem with this book."
2,Craft-by-numbers,"Incredibly disappointing. Nothing more than craft-by-numbers. Unlike many other books which offer more depth this is a forgettable book. I give it two stars because the book itself is nice to look at, but it's like an empty calorie meal. You'll come away wishing you'd eaten something more nutritious."
4,Cute and useful too,At first the photography attracted me. Then I appreciated the detailed instruction that explained how to make little boxes that will stand up on their creepy little legs. Fun reference I can see myself going back to for years.
1,Only One Thing Can Explain This,"I love Jim Rome and I think that his show is brilliant. However, fitting all of that onto one CD is impossible. I gave this CD a 1 star because you can listen to his show for free and it is infinitely better. There is only one reason that I can give for Jim doing this...... THE MONEY!"
2,"Gone through 2 controllers, both worked poorly","Even after calibrating both sticks, the left stick never returns to center all the way. On my first stick it would randomly pull to the left when centered, on my second it randomly pulls to the right.What stinks is that I'm stuck with it as many games (such as Just Cause 2) will not work with any controller but this one."
5,Love it for black ops and crysis wars.,"Haha keyboard and mouse is for losers, get one of these. I guarantee you will go down less in black ops zombies."
2,What a disappointment.,"The editors for this book series really missed the mark by having these two guys write this book. You'd think they'd have been overjoyed with the opportunity to expand from the Comic Book genre into a full length novel that propels so eloquently the DS9 story line. Instead, the authors continue the story in a pedantic manner. The characters don't develop in the same arc established by the previous books in the series. And I've guessed the next event in the book before reading it. Absolutely no surprises. These authors never strayed from the comfort of the game room where they have stagnated in the short story format of comics. Would that I could blurt out all of the major story points and spare other potential buyers from the torture."
3,"It's ok, but too little memory","It works as advertised, but in this day and age when gigabytes can be stored on paper-thin half-inch disks, there is no reason this device should have so little storage capacity. Gave it as a gift to a golfer who was noticably disappointed by the fact that it only holds one round of golf. Most similar golf gadgets along this line are similarly overpriced. Bought this one as it had a carabiner, making it easy to attach to the golf bag."
1,WRONG PRODUCT,THIS WAS THE WRONG PRODUCT DELIVERED TO ME!!!! I RECEIVED EARTH SCENT VANILLA!!!!!PLEASE SEND ME THE ONE I ORDERED!!!!!
3,Cute,"I bought this for my daughter because she picked it out at the store while we were shopping! She loved the way the baby giggled. The baby doll giggles so sweetly..but it's much cheaper in the stores than online. I don't recommend this doll for younger toddler because it's pretty hard to get the doll to giggle. But I must say, this is one of the dolls she will carry around with her...and hand it to me to make her giggle :)"
3,Cute but not practical,"This toy is very adorable - I had picked out a much fancier doll for my daughter but when she saw this one, she just lit up and I knew it was the one for her. I was glad to see that it claimed to be machine washable. When we got it home, and took it out of the packaging, I was reading the directions, and it said that before laundering, you just have to remove the giggle box. I looked the doll over, and it appears that you have to actually open the seam to remove the box. There is no velcro opening. That doesn't really seem practical. Other than that, it is cute for the money."
3,okay produt,Although this product was good for a basic yoga workout it is not as child friendly as I thought it would be. I did enjoy that the family took time to turns instructing.
2,not for beginners,"This yoga program might be good for families where all members are already very familiar with yoga poses. It is not good for my family: an intermediately experienced mom and two inexperienced kids ages 6 and 8. My 8 year old daughter, who is athletic and limber, woke up this morning with back and neck pain after her first time following the fast-paced dvd."
2,Disappointing...,"After waiting so long for a new Mack 10 album, I figured it'd be somethin' incredible seeing as how long it took. Things just do not always get better with age. There are only a few stand-out tracks here. Most of it is a dime a dozen. The production isn't too bad, really laid-back type stuff. The lyrics are pretty dull however. Save your money for tha next WSC album.Notable Tracks:Like ThisDa BiznessI'm A StarMy Chucks"
2,Wrong Item.,The seller indicated that this was a set of 4 cds. When I got my package it turned out to be only one cd and it only had like 10 tracks. Will I buy from them again? NO.
1,WARNING TO AUDIOPHILES!,This was the worst recorded music ever put on a cd.Audio quality is a 1 of 10.. If you love music loud and clear ... DONT BUY THIS SET!
4,Classical Music,"The selections on these disks are mostly well-known versions of popular classical pieces. They are abbreviated, however, and sometimes I longed for more. With the dynamic ranges, and my hearing loss, I found the music often lacking in quality for my listening pleasure."
1,"Well, they got one thing right...","Judging by the title, I figured I'd somewhat like this cd. I was dead wrong. This cd is straight-up a waste of time, space on a disk, and your life if you decide to buy it! It's the most pathetic attempt at pulling a new crowd into classical music, when the truth is, it sucks anyway! GIVE IT UP!! As for the cd, I don't think it would ever live up to its title. I mean, I hate the cd, therefore I like classical music?!?! WHO DO THEY THINK THEY ARE?! I should sue them!"
5,The title says it all.,"I bought this CD set for my fiance who requested a ""greatest hits"" of classical music. He was able to recognize 90% of the pieces, and has listened to the CDs several times in the past month. I am a great fan of classical music, so I was able to recognize that many of the pieces were not performed by top-rate musicians or orchestras, but my fiance didn't notice. He simply wanted an introduction to classical music in a way that was not too intimidating for a beginning listener. This set fulfilled its intentions perfectly."
2,Surrender!... and that's about it.,The first song is a true classic (possibly the best pop song ever written/recorded) and worth every penny charged for the entire album. I dislike the rest of the tracks which sound NOTHING like the first.
5,Cheap Trick essential classic,"A must have classic rock CD. Not a bad second of music from start to end. If you like classic rock, 70s rock, pop music, guitars, or if you have any sense for any music at all you must get this CD. The title track is haunting, the album-opener is pop rock iconic, the rest of the tracks are the epitome of 1970s rock and roll. Standout tracks: On Top Of The World, Auf Wiedersehen, Stiff Competition, Heaven Tonight."
3,The beats are great....the rapping is not,"This album is probably DJ Paul and Juicy J's best project along the lines of production, every beat is bumpin and just like always are very creative. As far as the rapping, this is, in my opinion, the worst Three 6 Mafia/Triple 6 Mafia release. With Lord Infamous being in jail, this album (alot like the Choices II soundtrack) has way too much Crunchy Blac on it, who may well be the worst rapper ever. If you are a Triple 6 fan you should get it just because of the production, but don't listen to it too much because this album gets very old, very fast."
1,Is this some kind of sick joke???,"That's it. It's official. I'm done with the Academy Awards. For quite some time now, I've been wondering what kind of morons pick the winners for these things.And the winners of this year's ""Best Song"" category cements it. These guys. That's right. THESE guys won an Oscar.Seriously.Ya know what would've been a better choice for ""Best Song""? ANYTHING!!!!And I thought 2006 was gonna be the year when this nonsensical garbage was blown out of the water for a new, talented, fresh mainstream. Silly me.Now I leave you with this chilling thought from Jon Stewart: ""For those of you keeping score at home, I just want to make something very clear. Martin Scorsese, zero Oscars. Three 6 Mafia, one."""
5,THE MOST KNOWN !!!,"I CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM. I'VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR IT AND IT'S WORTH IT. MY FAVORITE JOINT IS ""POPPIN MY COLLAR"" ""DON'T VIOLATE"" & ""PU**Y GOT YA HOOKED"" REMY DID HER THING ON THAT ONE. IF YOU'RE A 3-6 FAN THAN I'M MORE THAN SURE YOU'LL BE FEELIN THIS CD. MOSTLY EVERY CAR THAT PASSES BY IS USUALLY BLASTIN THIS JOINT INCLUDING ME. IT'S WORTH IT MOST DEF."
4,love this!!!,Three 6 mafia is amazing and this album is definetly one of their best in my opinion. theres not a single song that i have to skip and i can listen to the cd over and over and not get tired. if you like this cd you should def check out some of their older cds as well!!
4,One of the better cd's this year,"I've been listening to Three 6 for a while now. And I have to say, the album is better then I expected. Better then Tha Unbreakables, which is also pretty good. The production is very well, as are the guest appearances on the cd. As we see some of today's hottest artists, such as Young Buck, Paul Wall, Mike Jones and Lil Wyte featured on this cd. Best songs on the cd are the lead single ""I gotta stay fly"" ft. Young Buck and hip hop legends Eightball & MJG. And of course the remix featuring Slim Thug, Trick Daddy and Project Pat, who was just released out of jail. ""Swervin"" ft. Mike Jones & Paul Wall with it's relaxed and slow beat, ""Hard hittaz"", ""Half on a sack"" and ""Body Parts 3"" ft. the HCP. Check out newcomer Chrome. The kid's hot! Less better tracks include ""Poppin ya collar"" and ""Side 2 side"". Overall a very strong cd with not much wrong with it. A must for any Three 6 fan."
2,What Happened Here,"Come on 3 6 ive been a fan 4 awhile, they didnt even try to make a good album. Some of the songs r good, but to tell u the truth. They let me down big time. Dont waste your hard earned money on this. I aint no 3 6 hater im a fan, they aint like they used to be like when the song, ""Late Night Tip"" came out."
2,sucks on dicc and does it real good,three six's worst albumdamn da only junts i like are stay fly and stay fly remixif you want a good three 6 album get mystic styles or 3-6 feet underground or the endoh yeah and i aint a crip juss so yall knowits 1st ward blood niggaz 4life biiiiiiiittttttcccchhhhh
3,Quality writing but too much war reporting.,"This book has an incredible cast of writers: Hemingway, Dickens, Orwell, Churchill etc. However, if you are not a big fan of war reportage, you may want to look elsewhere. The majority of these articles are war related and although they are very well written, war is not a topic I find very interesting. Still, there a number of fascinating pieces of journalism, like the one about the San Francisco earthquake in 1906, and Dickens piece on a guillotine execution in a town square. It's worth a read but I would have liked to see more of a variety in topics."
5,Excellent reference for Performance Practicioners,"This is a great reference tool for anyone who is developing training assessments, performance assessments or tests. Worth in the investment to keep on hand as a reference tool for yourself and as a primer for anyone supporting your work."
1,The same song over and over again,"Very disappointing. I purchased the prior album by La Quinta Estacion, and loved it. Every song on this album sounds the same. Too bad."
4,Classic!,"Buy this album!Point! This is pure L.A. Guns. It's a mix of the first three album and their best since the marvellous ""Hollywood Vampires"". If you expect something different or new that don't sound like L.A. Guns forget it. Stacey Blades did a great job on guitar filling for Tracii Guns. A must have for the fans and a good start for the new ones! Highlights: ""Electric Neon Sunset"", ""Crazy Motorcycle"", ""Original Sin"" and the new best L.A. Guns song ""Vampire"". Play it loud!"
3,Ballers Phenom PS2,"The game, NBA Ballers Phenom, was just right when it got here and my grandson said it was ""sweet"". Guess I got the right thing. I do not feel that the game should be rated E. There is alot of violence and blood and bad language in it, but you have no control of that. I was completely satisfied"
3,No Suds!,I really like this shower gel. It smells really good and leaves my skin clean and smooth. The only thing I don't like about this product is that there are not a lot of bubbles and it doesn't foam up enough.
4,This shower gel and foam bath is aptly ...,"This shower gel and foam bath is aptly named. I couldn't really work up a lather, it was more like a rich cream. But oh, how nice that cream was! It left my skin so soft, softer than any other soap product I've used. The foam bath was a little disappointing. I really couldn't get much of anything to bubble or foam, but it left my skin soft."
2,Several members of my family tried this product ...,"Several members of my family tried this product and we all independently came to the same verdict on the shower gel -- we didn't like the smell at all. The gel worked just as well as any other we've tried, the only reason we wouldn't ever buy this gel is the horrible medicine-like smell that stays with you for several hours. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
3,"Not a bad product -- it foams well, ...","Not a bad product -- it foams well, and leaves you feeling nice and clean. It's not exactly my favorite scent, but I am sure it is for someone. A little too """"woodsy"""" for me. Overall, an okay product."
3,Russian Models,"Others have commented on the size of the book; but what surprised me is that about 95% of the models are from Russia and the Ukraine (country, model first name, and photographer are listed with each picture)"
3,Heavy Duty Construction But Not Performance,"Before I continue with my review, I must preface it by saying that I didn't actually use this potato masher for mashing potatoes but beans (for burgers, dips, etc.). SO, my review is based on how well this item performed doing that.That being said, this item is nicely made, looks nice, and would most likely last a lifetime. But, as just mentioned, I was looking for something that would adequately mash BEANS for me. I tried this for a couple of dishes, and both times it was a struggle to break up the beans, no matter how well (i.e. soft) they were. Because of it's dismal performance, I actually ended up sending this item back to Amazon.If you're looking for something strictly for potatoes, then this will probably serve you nicely. But, if you're searching for a masher to do more than just mash some spuds, look elsewhere."
5,Best Rap Band in the Planet,"Arsenik is off the hook. They throw in classical music along with hip-hop which you rarely find. Top song on this cd is ""Je Boxe Avec Les Mots"". Even if you don't understand french, you should still get this cd. These guys totally outperform American Rap artists.Peace"
4,Best french rap album,"It's simply one of the best french rap album of this century. Arsenik got intelligent lyrics, a great music(classical music) and the most original voices of the world of rap. If you like french rap, you must buy this album..."
4,Great Pop/Rock Songs...but...,"An album that should have rated 10 stars based on the quality of guitarist Rick Nielsen's songs, which range in quality from excellent ('Big Eyes', 'Clock Strikes Ten') to brilliant ('Downed', 'So Good To See You'). The problem is this recording plays as if the band was told by producer Tom Werman 'don't play or sing too loud or make too much noise or you will disturb the neighbors'. The low point is the lame, honky-tonk version of 'I Want You to Want Me'. It is an undeniable pleasure to listen to these great songs, but there is no definite high-point because the album never reaches a high sonic level of intensity. Also, none of the bonus tracks are really exceptional.Between the CDs 'Music for Hangovers', 'At Budokan The Complete Concert' and the bonus track 'You're All Talk' from the remastered 'Cheap Trick (1977)' CD, better, harder rocking versions of all the original 10 cuts are available."
2,Nicer in the photo,"These are a cute design, but the actual earrings are not the quality they seem in the photo. The materials seem of low quality."
2,Extremely Confusing,"The book, Devil in a Blue Dress, was very confusing. I thought this book required too much thinking. I like reading books that are easily read and interesting. I found this book very long and never ending. I found the books wording very simplistic. It did not catch my attention. At times I had to read a sentence 3 or 4 times. There was no really clear plot. I believe the only reason it made some top lists was because it was very suspensful. Though I did not like the book, at times I would be at the edge of my chair wanting to find out what will happen. The book is basically about a man named Easy Rawlins, that is hired to find a woman named Daphne Monet. She got a hold of pictures that could destroy a mayoral election for a canidate named Mr. Teran. From that point on I can't explain what happened because I really didn't follow the story. I would only recommend this book for people who love all kinds of twists and turns in the plot."
3,A little lame,"If you're bored and need something real simple to read, this might be your book. I have the feeling any Easy Rawlings Mystery will fit the bill. I don't need to read more than one."
1,I hate to rate a book on cost but,Amazon has a lot of nerve charging $11.99 for the Kindle edition a 22 year old book. The hardcover book is only $10. Amazon is not publishing the book! There's no paper or ink or distribution costs. What happened to providing ebooks at a decent price? Amazon won the court case that disallows bogus publishing fees. We expected prices to come down after that. It seems that Amazon is making hay now while the sun's shining and we're paying for it!!
3,substantially overrated,"'Devil in a Blue Dress' has a oodles of atmosphere and quirky characters but the plot is so convoluted that this reader was bored with it all half way through. Kudos to the author for capturing the feel of 1940s Los Angeles. But I think he went a bit haywire in trying to stitch together a story with too many odd characters and mini plot twists,Bottom line: rather disappointing after a promising start. 'Devil in a Blue Dress' does not inspire me to read anything else by this author."
2,Bestial - could have been better,"Couldn't finish the book, read like old news stories that you could have found going back through real old newspapers yourself that the author cobbled together. Style was also odd, oddly worded in places.I don't recommend it."
4,Gruelling murderfest,"Great easy read, the gorilla mans work chronologically laid out before you and brilliant retelling of the manhunt surrounding his capture, escape, recapture, trial and death"
5,If you like a mix of Rap and Rock you will like it,This is an awsome cd. It is a mix of 2 kinds of music. The whole cd is awsome it is all different kind of music on each track. They are kinda like ICP but better. I saw then the first time in florida at the buzz bake sale and they were awsome and nuts.Also if you are a stoner this is your music.
3,Lond handle problematic,This is a good solic frying pan - price is reasonable considering it is copper. I have only two complaints. 1. The copper is a little thin. 2. The extra long handle tends to pull the pan down when the contents are light.
4,Distant Cousin,"Since it was written by him, it seemed he may have strecthed the truth in places. Overall, a very interesting and showed his travels around South and Central Texas. I would have liked to know more about the business he had with Capt. King. I think they might have been some ""Hot"" cattle envolved. Amazon is very competitive inpricing and Great Service.Murray DentonGrandson of A.B. Hardin, Hunt, Texas"
1,"Granted, it's impressive for a 14 year old to write a book,","but what can a 14 year old boy do other than regurgitate what he's heard from rush limbaugh, his parents, and the other conservative sources that his mom and dad expose him to every day.Can you take seriously the opinions of someone who's never owned a home, worried about paying his rent/mortgage, dated, been married, raised children, lived on his own and established his independence?I will not cut Kyle Williams any slack because he's young. This book is simply a collection of ""other people's opinions.""And more importantly, can a 14 year old really be happy spending is youth dwelling on politics, abortion, homosexuality, and myriad other meaningless subjects that americans distract themselves with? ..."
1,From the lovely publisher who brought you that savage...,"Michael Savage that is, who's real last name is Weiner, or is it Wiener? Whatever, this future Hannity is a hot dog, just like Savage. No respectable, intelligent American is going to pay much attention to a 15 year old boy giving political and cultural advice. If they do, may God help us. Maybe if he wrote a great first novel, was a star football player, a viruoso pianist, or posessed some other talent, we could be genuinely interested in what he has to say. Parroting the agenda of the right wing, probably his parents, is something any chimpanzee could do. Takes no talent at all, just chutzpah. If he was a mini, lefty Howard Dean, I'd say the same thing. Hey Kyle, get some education, a job, meet some people who aren't just like you, then write your book."
1,Recycled conservative garbage,"I'll give it to Kyle, he has the education level and maturity to be a Worldnetdaily columnist. That isn't saying much since he is in the ranks of McCarthyist Ann Coulter, racist junkie Rush Limbaugh and professional liar Sean Hannity. Kyle takes the conservative party line about evil liberals, a left-wing media conspiracy, degraded education system and a plot by homosexuals and rehashes it with unimaginative, unoriginal predictability. The author's claim of in-depth research is paramount to turning on the 700 Club, listening to hours of right wing radio, and drowning himself into the paranoid delusions of Fox News. Being a young author and columnist isn't much of an accomplishment when all you to is paraphrase your conservative peers."
1,"Seen and Heard, Unfortunately","A painful book, written from a teenage Rush Limbaugh point-of-view. It's nice that the kid could get it published(no surprise religious publisher Thomas Nelson put this out, check out his titles), but past that it's dogma."
2,"save your money,,,anyone want one at a discount?","I was disappointed with this one, droll comes to mind, this is one I wish I had seen before purchasing. There are a great many movies I love to watch many times over and this just isn't going to be one of them,,,,taking bids on my copy!"
1,Sick of this security BS,"Bought this movie last week off of amazon. The movie is great, saw it in theaters. The problem is the random pauses since I've placed the blue ray disc into my PS3. Seriously?! I payed good money for this movie and I can barely watch it correctly. These moronic security fixes don't stop hackers and just punish honest people that pay for movies. Next time I'm just going to rent a movie from amazon instant play and avoid the film companies completely.Here's a tip if your having this issue. Just disconnect your ps3 from your internet connection. Film is great nonetheless. If you don't want to deal this this nonsense I suggest you just get it through amazons on demand."
1,Rating is for Bluray not for the movie,Be aware that this blu-ray might not work in your blu-ray player! I have a Samsung BD6500 player that was just purchased last year and it won't play this. I get a message that I need to update my firmware. I have the latest firmware and I contacted Samsung about this. They said they were working on it. But still nothing several months later. From what I have read this is the issue with all Samsung and some Sony players!
2,Poor and lacking,"Now granted the X-Men movies have not been written for the fans of the comic books. That much is obvious. But this movie just does a huge disservice to both strip and to movie fans. Besides having terrible dialog and no story line it just blows to bits the entire X-men story. The relationship between Charles and Magneto is completely distorted which is unfortunate for so many reasons. The acting in this is superficial and Michael Fassbender's portrayal of him as a man on a mission to kill is just wrong.There is nothing memorable about the cast with January Jones being particularly ineffective. She has the winy, put upon queen role down pat. The only remotely interesting bit was the cameo by Wolverine which was perfectly played. Other than that the weak story, bad acting and terrible directing is just not worth it."
5,owllady,Grandson love this. He was so happy when I handed it to him. Recommend to buy any age. Recieved fast.
3,meh,i bought this on pre-order and it came 7 days after it was released... might as well gone to best buy and got it sooner. The movie itself is ok.. not as good as the original xmen movie.. but better than 2 & 3. havent messed with the digital copy yet.. but i plan on putting that on my ipad. overall.. its just a dvd that u will watch a few times and then it will collect dust.
2,DOESN'T WORK ON ALL PLAYERS!,I have a samsung 3D player (fully updated) and it won't play. And Best Buy won't refund. Buyer beware. Plays on SONY after a memory warning but not on some models of samsung.
4,"Enjoyable for adults, definitely not for kids & younger teens","As a fan of the first three X-Men movies & Wolverine, I really enjoyed ""First Class."" My only caveat is that this movie, unlike the other X-Men movies, includes strong cruelty (by Nazis) that would not be appropriate for younger teens."
1,X - Men Last Class,"Not worth buying. Despite appreciating the original X men, this modern take is twisted with subtle liberal themes.This films script speaks for itself.""Mutant and proud""You be the judge. It is time to stop accepting this false comparison.Strictly a review of the film not the product.Although it does has so nice music."
5,Excellent movie Prequel,"Really gives fans good background on the developement of the Mutant phenomenon, related to the beginning of the ""X"" types ."
2,The digital download was used.,Buyers: In the future becarful when buying movies that say they have a digital copy.Sellers: If you use the digital copy code specify this in the discription.
5,Great Movie with tricky tie-ins to the already made sequels,I actually started liking the characters and getting the feeling that the actors studied their post dated previous films. Great movie!
2,FREEZES AND SKIPS!,"I have a sony stand alone blu ray player as well as a playstation 3, and throughout the film it skips around. The sound/picture are great, but if I can only enjoy the film without it crapping out every couple of minutes. Fix the issue and send us customers replacements."
2,not the legit first class,"granted i did not see this movie i was one of the many who boycotted it because they call this movie First Class yet the only member from the first class that is in it is Beast. The Original First Class was Angel, Beast, Cyclops, Iceman, and Jean Grey. but in this movie they put havok in instead of cyclops which is weird because havok is cyclops brother but he was a member of Forge's X factor not the Xmen. We get a different angel some misquito chick. i hate when comic Movies stray from the comic materials. How could they not get the original first class it was in the first ever issue of X-men. this movie and the Wolverine movie stray from the material. I pray someday we get a decent X-men movie until then im sticking with the 90s cartoon series at least they get it right."
4,a good start!,This movie is a good explanation of the mutant conflict in general. It was well done. I liked it very much.
1,serious issues with this Blu Ray,"There are some serious issues with this blu-ray, I returned it thinking it was defective and the new disc doesn't work either. Won't work on our new PS3 and LG top of the line blu-ray player. Yes, both have the latest updates. I would not purchase until they can get this defective blu-ray fixed. The digital copy is a joke - you get 1 chance to download and it can only be used on the computer you download to."
3,it's ok,"This movie is not as good as the first x-men movie, maybe slightly better than the 2nd x-men movie, better than the 3rd in that trilogy (not saying much really considering the 3rd). The pacing of this movie was its biggest problem, it felt more like a music video or a clift-notes version of an actual movie than an actual movie. best part of the movie would be magneto and professor x's relationship, not in the least because they are the only two characters developed enough to be legit characters. there are worse ways to waste part of an afternoon *shrug*"
4,Better than the Other X-Man Movies,"In my view, this movie was the best of all the live action X-Man movies. The main characters are well developed and interesting."
1,NEXT TIME I'LL BUY THE DVD,"Very dissapointed with this product, tried to watch it last night and first the movie would not load and then at the middle of the movie just stopped and nothing would work, luckily I had already downloaded the digital copy, but still I'm very mad at amazon, for not warning me before i gave them my money, since i got the movie a month ago, now I can't exchange it for a refund. Makes me think that the high quality of a Bluray disc comes at a very high price, guess I'll stick buying DVDs instead of Bluray, at least I know my DVD player doesn't need any crappy upgrades that just make it hard for me to enjoy a good movie."
4,begininngs for X Men,"This story explains many of the questions from previous X-Men movies. If you want to better understand the relationship of characters, this is for you."
4,Not as compressing as I hoped from reading other reviews,"From reading other reviews, I was hoping that these would have material of reasonable thickness and would be fairly tight and compressive. ""Ordered a size up so they'd be less tight"" etc. So I ordered my size, and they're slightly compressive, but not very. The material is substantial enough to compress, but they're only skin-tight; not compressing in any significant way.Of the types of compression shorts I've tried, these are the only ones that feel like it would be okay to try going a size down. Most feel like, at a size down, the hem at the thigh would be too tight. This has a different kind of hem and feels like, if all the measurements reduce more or less evenly, the next size down *ought* to fit well at the thigh."
3,it is correct,"well the item is ok but there is one problem when you wash it in the dish washer the upper neck or were you attach it to the mixer shaft oxidizies and turns black,so you have to wash it by hand"
3,It fits my mixer,This was the lowest price for this attachment for my mixer. The item arrived as expected and fits my mixer perfectly. The shipping was also super amazing fast.
5,A Necessary Tool for your Kitchen Aid Mixer,"This is a necessary tool for your KitchenAid mixer, for any kind of whipping (egg whites, whip cream, batters etc).I am happy with my purchace and please to get it for a great price (2/3's the price of departments stores like Sears, Macy's or the Bay)"
2,Not stainless steel,While the original was stainless steel the replacement is aluminum and therefore made of a far less quality material. It can't be put in the dishwasher. The description didn't state that it was aluminum so I feel I was mislead.
2,Not according the origianl specs,My daughters love cooking. they use this mixer regularly. this replacement wire whip seems to be slightly smaller than the original so it doesn't get to the stuff on the bottom of the bowl. My kids have to lift the bowl up while the mixer is running. I'm in the market to purchase another one.
4,Wire whip,Was not impressed with the whip. Seemed to be made of a lighter weight material compared to the older whip that it replaced. Cannot compare the quality of the two metals. Guess I am used to the older quality of material.
5,It just keeps on truckin',This is a replacement whip for my 30+year old Kitchen aid mixer. It still works great...just needed a new whisk. Excellent product!
5,It is a crime NOT to release this in DVD,"In 1955, I raduate from high school and was headed for the military. I saw this movie and the rest became history. I have never found a more patriotic movie andwould love to have a DVD version. I have tried those that sell you a bootleg copyand there are some found on Amazon and I am sure they are not aware. But let usvery old retired flyboys have something to watch in the cold winter months ahead."
4,Strategic Air Command on DVD,"Does anyone know if Paramount has any plans to release this classic on DVD? I've got the movie on VHS, but it would be great to see this movie on DVD and in widescreen format."
4,Nostalgia,"Former Air Force personnel and others, will enjoy outstanding footage of B-36s and B-47s taxiing and flying, in an otherwise ""campy"" movie. 'Too bad this film hasn't been remastered to DVD."
2,They werent ready,"This was one of the most anticipated georgia albums to drop that year and when it did EVERYBODY was pissed. The cd is wack, you cant get jiggy with this ****. Get the second album. That album gets 5 stars easy"
2,The end of am era,"The two-year feud between former best friends Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie appears to be over. Ironically, the producer of The Simple Life says it was FOX's ill-fated plans for the show's new season that got Hilton and Richie back together.Jon Murray wanted to put the pair on a ""deserted island with a bunch of survivalists"" next season, he tells the Associated Press. But Hilton and Richie ""reached out to each other in universal disdain for the island concept,"" he says, ""and rekindled their friendship."""
5,wonderful,I read this book to all my grandchildren and they just loved it. I also have several older friends that read the book and they also enjoyed it. It is nice to have a clean fun book to read for a change.
4,Get Your Small Group Out of the Boat,"Ortberg's small group series are among the best, if used with his teaching DVD's (Zondervan, but you'll have to find that elsewhere, it appears).This particular study appeals to a broad range of backgrounds, and experience levels. We all wrestle with ""staying comfortable"" vs. ""stepping out in faith"" when the situation calls for it. Through excellent groups discussion and Scripture investigation questions it is easy to guide a group to go beyond their current ""comfort zone"" and take steps of faith ""outside the boat.""But purchasethe DVD for best results (use an Internet search engine and you should find it quickly). Ortberg is a master teacher, and his 25-30 minute teaching is a must."
4,know your versions,"Just to clarify for those who (like me) are confused - Diane Warren wrote the song and Rod Stewart sang the original whilst Russell Watson sang a cover version specifically for the TV show ""Star Trek Enterprise"". If you heard the TV version first, as I did, then I would strongly suggest you get Russell Watson's version (there is a full length version depsite what you may read here) - the TV version has a more orchestral backing and I find it a more powerful song as a result, though fans of Rod will not be disappointed by his version either. Whichever you buy hats off to Diane Warren for writing such a great song."
3,Lacking important references,"Although the title says Amazonia, a lot of the content pertains to Orinoquia. Prospective buyers should be aware that a recent volume of Ethnohistory (also edited by Whitehead) contains much of the same material (by some of the same authors). The biggest problem that I had with the book is that very important recent work done among some of the native groups mentioned in the text is totally ommitted in the references. It seems like a collection of friends got together to write this book and dismiss the work of other good and emerging scholars. One of the important lessons taught to all graduate students is to cite the work of others, particularly when it is relevant. This work is careless in its review of the current literature and contains some factual errors that specialists will have no problem detecting. I found that it offered nothing new."
1,Occasionally They Get it Wrong,"I have been a fan of BBC's ""What Not to Wear"" and I thoroughly enjoyed the first book, but What Not to Wear for Every Occasion was a grave disappointment. Not only did I not agree with most of the looks created, I felt that often the ""don't"" examples would work far better than the ""do's"".I did not heed some of the negative reviews I read before purchasing this book and that has proven to be a mistake. Don't be fooled-this is not the customary Susannah and Trinny fare and that is disappointing."
2,Already too dated!,"Sorry, but this book is quite a disappointment for fans. The looks they put together might have been cutting edge back in 2002-03 when the book was published, but now they look ridiculous!"
1,What Not to CONSIDER!,"I checked this book out from the library to see if it warranted a purchase--it didn't. Every ""before"" looks better than the ""after."" The authors have an almost unearthly obsession with pants that drag on the ground, hair that hangs in your face (lest it look ""too done"") and knee-length knit coats that look like some ratty bathrobe from the '70s. (Maybe they assume their readers/viewers all have large tushies that need covering.) Don't bother with this lemon. A subscription to VOGUE would be more helpful for the fashion-challenged or those just looking for ideas & tips to update their image."
3,i like the pictures to show contrast in styles,"just as nice as the first, yet some things suggested are too ""fashion fad"" and will not seem as edgy and great looking down the road... i recommend "" color me beautiful"" for the real ""how to's"""
4,Know what to wear in any situation,This book is great because it tells you pratical advice about what to wear and not wear in different events. It also shows how you can go from work to play or other events without having to go home and change compleatly. This book provides real advice that you can actually use.
3,Fun and helpful,"There are some good tips in this book and the fact that there are do and don't photos is helpful. Some of the don'ts look like do's to me though, so I guess I need the bookI found the accessories to be particularly fun and inspiring"
1,A complete disappointment,"I bought this watch in 2007 and I've had to send it 3 times for repair in the past 2 years.First time, the watch started running really fast.Second time, the compass' crown broke off.Third time, the watch simply stopped working.Every time I send it back I have to pay shipping.The service and responsiveness of CoServ (the Seiko repair service in the US) has been dismal: they never returned the original box I send on the first repair (despite multiple communications); and each repair takes a good one to two months.I love the look of this watch; but it's been too much hassle."
3,A different view,"First of all, in general it is a well-written book. However, the coverage of the Analytical Section is VERY weak, in my opinion. Repeating ad nauseum that some schools don't bother about Analytical scores does not help when, in your case, they in fact care about it.The math review is very good, but if you *have* background in mathematics or a related field (bear in mind that if it is not your case, just ignore this review), it is near useless. Seeing dozens of pages dedicated to this section and *near none* to the Analytical test is frustrating.If you have to buy only one book and need training in the Analytical section of the GRE, I cannot recommend this book. But if you do not have this need and would like to get a good math review, just read the other opinions."
3,"Published in 2002, so a little old now","I just received this book and was disappointed to find it's seven years old. Amazon should be more clear on publishing or copyright dates. There is at least one newer version--Vlk is one of 3 authors of it. Look for that one, perhaps on other sites if the Amazon site doesn't specifically tell you the date."
4,GREs suck as much as the SATs,"I thought this book was a great way to ease me into taking the GREs. Everything is very easy to understand and well illustrated by the author (as well as funny).Instead of giving lists of vocab you have to read through the book to compile a list - which at first I thought was annoying but in the end I thought it was better. I did as they suggested, making flashcards for every word. However, if I could go back and write the 400 cards again, I would have divided the seperate colors into positive words, negative words and neutral. That way if you didn't remember the definition you could hopefully remember the color.Finally, I would say that although this book was very user-friendly I am glad I purchased a second (Kaplan with an attached CD of tests) book. I found the second book to be a bit harder and between the two gave me a better range of questions.Good luck!"
1,Do Not Waste Your Time!,"This was an awful book. Nothing that was discussed in this book was covered during the GRE. The verbal section was the worst. It tells you that the GRE will have a lot of Antonyms and Synonyms for you to answer. Let me tell you, on the new version of the GRE I found neither of these questions. I mean they were not even close. It was a waste of money and a waste of time. Get a better book."
4,Easy to use book but needs supplement.,"I recently took the GRE and to prep for the test I used this Dummies book. The book was easy to read, entertaining and very informative. I felt a lot less nervous about the test because the book told me what to expect. The math review was good and I think I would have done better on the verbal part if I had memorized the vocabulary words they provided in the book. The only reason the book does not get 5 stars is because there was math on the GRE not covered in the book. I think that another book in combination with this book would have helped to better prepare me. All in all though I would recommend the book."
2,"GRE for dummies, fifth edition","Beware...althought this text is easy (and relatively painless) to read, the math section does NOT provide adequate preparation. Several types of questions found on the actual GRE are nowhere to be found in this supposedly comprehensive study guide. I was very disappointed when, after studying the math section religiously, I encountered problems on the GRE that I could have easily solved, had they been reviewed in the math section of the study guide. I would recommend using this guide in conjunction with another (possibly the ETS) study guide to prepare for the GRE."
4,GRE for Dummies Review,I really do like the book and it helped me to study for GRE better than most other books can.
1,Disappointing!,"About a week after placing the order, Amazon sent a notice informing me that the vendor had not shipped my order yet, advising me to contact the seller. In response to my inquiry, I receveived a cancellation without comment.This is the second time this has happened to me, from another seller and now from this one, just this month. It appears to be a growing trend to advertise and accept orders for books which are not actually part of the seller's inventory.I resent this type of disregard for the buyer's good faith willingness to do business with sellers advertising their wares through Amazon. I will have to re-evaluate my own willingness to do so in the future, but certainly I will not do business with theis seller at any time in the near future, and I strongly recommend the same to those reading this."
3,One twist,"Tasteless dreck from writer William Goldman, wildly overacted by Steiger, but with one single saving grace -- a neat little twist in the story, not at the end, but about halfway through -- it begins in a bar. I've never forgotten it."
1,"I am so, so disappointed.","This is my third attempt at trying to love a Food Saver, and this one too, will end up in a garage sale. I paid over $200 for this machine, it doesn't seal tightly, the seals don't hold...just yuk. I will now save my money for a chamber type machine...was so hopeful.."
5,What would I do without it,"We recently purchased a chest freezer and immediately bought the foodsaver 2840 to seal our freezer foods. We have been extremely happy with it. The instructional DVD was cheesy, yet useful. It is easy to use and doesn't take up too much counter space.We purchased the jar sealers, universal lids, rounded cannisters, and additional sealing material/bags. I strongly recommend each of those items because they are useful in some cases where bags are a pain or not so useful."
2,So-So Performance,It doesn't create very much vacuum and leaves a lot of air in the bag. You can't run the vacuum longer to make it better because it seals automatically when it thinks it's done. My old Kenmore was much better.
5,Great!,I am very pleased with this FoodSaver. It is everything that I had expected. Utube is the best tutorial as the manual is somewhat confusing.
1,expensive lesson,Gaskets went bad after about 1 year. New ones not available. All customer service can do is sell you a new one. I DON'T THINK SO!!!!
1,"Brand New, Out of the Box, Did Not Work","I bought this unit to store some dehydrated food for a backpacking trip, and received it brand new in the box. After several dozen attempts, it never was able to seal anything. When I tried to use the vacuum sealer, it made a strange noise and then quit trying, giving me a flashing error light every time. I researched around online to see if there was some simple fix or something I was doing wrong, but I couldn't find anything. I thought the design of this V2840 was cool, but in my opinion I should never have to wrestle this hard to get a brand new product to do the only thing it was designed to do. What a joke! I'm probably going to try a simpler model ... don't waste your money on this one."
1,Low quality junk,This is my third and last Food Saver. Three different models and each one lasts about two years before switches or gasket die. The manufacturer clearly sacrifices quality for profit. This product line sucks. Literally and figuratively.
2,Intermittantly works,"We bought the V3825 Foodsaver in December of 2008 and should have taken it back.It is difficult to activate the sealing function - put in the bag and keep trying until it FINALLY decides to activate. Then after more than 4 or 4 uses it signals overheating and then we have to suspend operation waiting to start again. Meanwhile the meat products we bought from a wholesale club have to be kept in the fridge waiting. This has happened repeatedly and not just on occasion. Tried all the ""removing the gasket and turning it over, etc"" suggested by an email reply from Foodsaver - no help. I, personally, would NOT purchase this model at all. Plus, the model definitely leaves too much of an edge when sealing when it does want to work.Our old one - purchased years ago - worked perfectly."
5,Best investment I ever made,"I used to throw meat out constantly because of freezer burn. It was such a waste. I purchased this on a recommendation from a friend. I am so glad I did! It works great! The sealer seals the bag perfectly, the cutter slides smoothly through the bag, and it seems to suck every bit of air out of the bag. There is a little compartment to catch anything that is liquid, and the container lifts out of the unit for easy washing. The hose to suck the air out of containers tucks neatly behind the unit for storage.I have had this unit for 2 years and it has worked perfectly! I use it frequently, as I have gone through several boxes of bag material rolls. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to purchase one."
3,Size Matters,"FoodSaver V2840 Advanced DesignI had a slim model, the Food Saver Quick Start V325, for the past few years. It required you to insert the bag or plastic roll and hold the lid until it stopped humming. I was very satisfied with it.This one has some pluses-it is automatic, has good power and it has bag storage. It works well. The downside to all this is that it is larger and takes up more counter space. The old one was so slim and light that I put it away in an upper cabinet easily. This one has to either stay on the counter -sideways takes up less space- or get put below with the pots until I need it. I like it. I use it. The size of it still bothers me."
1,isn't there already enough of this?,"With the American people subjected to an absolute FLOOD of open-borders propaganda from the Establishment Media, is there really any reason for this book?"
5,first time trying,"This moisturizer shipped very quickly and I am very pleased with it as well. Its light and is very mild. I've had issues with somethings overdrying and this is a great fix for it. I love even more its aloe and olive oil. I'd like to try other blends, but would recommend!"
2,Disappointing given the ratings and reviews,"I bought this book for four reasons: 1. Rave reviews here, 2. Intro by Patrick Lencioni, 3. Review by Dalai Lama, and 4. that the work is based on lots of research.While I agree that the book is easy to read, I did not experience much substance in the book, and I think it only provided a very basic introduction to Emotional Intelligence. Given all the research the authors clamim to have done, there is not much analysis or explanation of what the research means. The 2nd star in this rating comes from the self-assessment.There are many other books on EQ out there (Goleman for example) that provide much more substance and depth."
3,This was a simple book.,I liked this book but it was way to simple. i would suggest this to a 2 year old because it might be to easy.
3,"I LOVE THE SMELL, but more of a COLOGNE than a TOILETTE","This must be one of the best smells I had- young, fresh, elegant and ""secretly sexy"". Aside from that, the bottle was very nice and so masculine.HOWEVER, The smell progressively deteriorates in just few hours. Although I can guarantee that it would really last for about 24 hours that is if you smell it yourself with your nose close to the cloth. The essence of a fragrance to be smelled by anyone in a distant may seemed to wear down unexpectedly for an eau de toilet. This is not a parfum and neither a cologne. But frankly in my honest opinion, it works like a cologne."
5,Hastened to the gave:the Gypsy murders,"I can't believe someone had the courage to write this book. I am sad to say that it is more serious than this book could ever expose. It is hard to fathom that people could be so vicious and sick and to do such crimes. My grandmother was a victim of some of these sick, twisted people. I am so glad that Jack Olsen had the guts to write this book. I could not put it down. I wish there were more books on Gypsy scams, crime and murder."
1,What was the point?,"Do not be misled by the hype on the cover! ""Jack Olsen's particular gift is his ability to illuminate the souls of his characters.""?? I feel bad for author Mr. Olsen. I couldn't find any illumination. There is no real emotion. Eight pages of chilling photos?? The most chilling photo is of private investigator Fay Faron in a cheesy Sam Spade get-up. This book is amateurishly written. Maybe the point was to bring to our attention the problem of scams targeting the elderly. In this it has barely succeeded."
1,The article in Vanity Fair was as informative as this book.,"Yuck, just flat out yuck! Without all the refernces to what Fay Faron has for breakfast, her need for money, her ability to take vacations when she needs money and owes her vet money, this book would not have been much longer than the article in Vanity Fair magazine on this case. I was just really disappointed in this one. I haven't read an Olsen book before, and this one just didn't do enough for me that I would even bother to pick up another one."
2,Not durable,"I purchased 2 shoe stretchers to stretch a pair of shoes simultaneously. After the initial stretch, I wanted to move the ortho plugs to another space and noticed that the holes did not match on both stretchers. Then, when I tried to use them on second pair of shoes, the handle fell off, and the wood cracked into two pieces."
1,wish i hadn't purchased,"The inside part kept getting stuck, and I had to shove something into the toe to get it back out of the shoe. The only think I like is the cedar smell. Either I'll send it back or just keep in my closet for the wood smell. Otherwise, it's useless."
3,So - So,Not especially well made. Doesn't necessarily stretch were needed. It didn't stretch well towards the toes as needed. Poor quality screw.
1,Disappointed,This book and francisco Goldman are highly regarded. He uses magic realism to trace history intertwined with two girls lives. It does not work for me as it seems only an aaccumulation of details and pontification.
5,I thought it was great.,Captures all the qualities of small town Texas. Did a terrific job of creating true to life characters. If you spent any time Texas you would swear you already knew every person in the movie. Its also a must see if you grew up hunting.
5,leaves an impact,"The characters stay with you after the credits fade. This is a turbulent tale of human emotions and small-town life. Might be compared as a superior example of the genre that includes ""Peyton Place"". I thought the acting and direction were worthy of 4 or 5 stars."
2,Not too close to home from the hill,"After reading the book 3 times, I was disapointed in the movie script. The Captain played by Robert Mitchum was assumed to have many children in the town (due to the many town kids who had his trademark coal black wavy hair) His wife was homely and was of high moral fiber. His own son Theron was strong, smart and very athletic. His mother doted on him and his father taught him how to hunt. Theron got Libby pregnant and Libby's father thought it was the Captain and shot him to death. Theron disapeared in the woods and was never found and the Captains wife died a broken woman who never knew her husband's love. If the movie would have followed the book, it would have been a far better movie!"
2,Great idea but not so fast....,"Yeah, this should have been a great product. And it mostly works... 85% maybe. But you'd expect more from Alpine wouldn't you. Specifics - no matter what you do, no matter how many times you change it, the system will set to ""repeat all"". You can change the settings on your ipod and on your deck and the next time you use it, it'll default back to ""repeat all"". Why??? Second, the text is too big - you can't read titles. And you can't change the text size, no matter what they tell you. This just should have been tested more and should have been a better product."
2,Not such a great book,Don't bother with this book as there is nothing much to be found new here.Anyone who likes to read this type of book will be disappointed.
3,gator bait,i have always wanted a copy of this movies i first saw it on cable's and i never saw it completely.. we went to the same bar and everyday it was playing always saw bits and pieces so when it came up i wanted it a whole lot like a b=movie but very poorly made and cheap acting plenty of action's with a limited subjects'
1,Worst design ever...,"After installing this heater to the wall outlet with the enclosed ""adapter"" the heater repeatedly fell out and no matter how I tried it would not hold the heater to the wall. Sent it back and have yet to hear about refund."
2,No Thanks,"After reading the problems with mounting this heater, I will pass up buying it. I have a wall socket in my bathroom but it's too close the the door frame for the complicated mounting this requires. I will buy a heater with a long cord and mount the heater (removable) on the back of the door."
3,bad quality,"For the price of it, it's expensive as quality of the plastic case is very weak and the cable is way too short (exactly 7 inches). Bear in mind the power is only 500W at it max, which is just ok for a small room."
5,Last Brickmaker...,"Sidney Poitier demonstrates that he still ""has it."" The movie is great for family viewing with heartwarming themes of work ethics, integrity, and perseverance. DVD was delivered on or before the promised date in excellent condition."
5,Love Them,I am very happy with my purchase. These shoes are really comfortable. They look great with jeans or any other pant you could wear. Love them!
1,very big and heavy,I did not expect that they are very big and heavyI can not walk with itthey are like stone ):
4,Am I reading the same book?,"I have to differ with the earlier reviewers. I found LSAT for Dummies to be very, very helpful. It gives solid common-sense advice, and explanations for the sample questions are very clear and easy to follow. The sample questions turned out to be very similar to the ones on the actual test, so there were no surprises there. Yes, there are a couple of misprints, which I hope the Dummies will fix before printing more books (one star off for those)."
4,"Helpful, but a more indepth prep is needed","This was the first test prep book I used. I just finished it over the weekend. I will certainly have to buy a more indepth book to continue my preparation. The logic games section has good tips, but the book and this section in particular, is just too short."
4,Good introductory prep,"I thought this was a nice intro prep book, but you will definitely want to buy the LSAT prep book with the actual tests to practice. I really like the simple tips, and the simple breakdown of how to approach the questions without saturating you with too much info. I think the best application is to start with this to get comfortable with how to approach the questions, and then practice using the real LSAT tests. I also appreciated the calming tone the author had. Instead of getting you all jacked up about how hard the test is and how much you have to study, she seemed a lot more practical."
3,Answer Keys are Wrong,"I loved the way this book was structured and how it explained the solutions to problems, but several times the letters and numbers in the answer keys were misprinted and didn't match up with the problems. It was very confusing and disappointing."
1,Do Not Buy,"This was the first book I bought to prepare for the LSAT prior to taking a proper prep course. I plowed through and did really well on all the tests. I was pretty confident, until I noticed that the book was published in 2004. I decided to pick up the latest Princeton Review book (2011) and started from the beginning. When I got to the testing section, I was in for a huge shock. The questions on the Princeton Review were SIGNIFICANTLY harder than this book and actually inline with every actual LSAT I have downloaded from the net. This book was a poor prep tool, unless you just want to boost your confidence.Do NOT waste your money on this book. Buy a proper, up to DATE prep book. You'll be grateful."
5,The classic of deer mouse biology.,"Can you believe it - 30 years old, and still going strong? A must-have book for those of us who want to learn basic deer mouse biology. The chapters are:Paleontology, Classification, Speciation, Habitats and Distribution, Anatomy (a definitive monograph), Ontogeny (illuminating), Parasites, Endocrinology, Genetics, Home Range and Travels (excellent), Population Dynamics, Behavior Patterns, Psychology, and Activity.Don't study deer mice without one!"
3,makes you appreciate the fact that you don't live in russia,"i heard the taped version of the book...the narration by barbara caruso was excellent and the book was somewhat interesting . . . i just feel it could have been a bit shorter . . . i.e., the same point seemed to be made over and over . . . regardless, the new russia (in the early 1990s) still is not a place i would like to live in--or even visit."
5,Gershwin stands the test of time,"Absolutely the best, still after all these years. I'm very happy with the album."
5,How can you go wrong?,"I loved watching Planet of The Apes when I was a kid and I still like watching it. The story like is great the costumes are wonderful, and the set is outstanding. I don't usually watch repeats but I enjoy watching this a few times per year."
2,"What, again!","Folks, you'll have ample opportunity to get popcorn, drinks, bathroom breaks, read the newspaper, and maybe even take a nap or two. Not as well done as the original, or for that matter, even the sequel. The graphics were pretty good, but even the acting/text/lines were stilted. Not something I'd see again."
2,Nice try but the movie was full of holes,"I like science fiction and the Planet of the Apes series. This movie I thought had potential, but the logical flow of the movie had a lot of logical holes. I mean, how did the ape know the virus had gone airborne later in the movie? How did he find his way back to the house?"
4,Let the Apes Rise...,"Let the Apes Rise... You, sit back and enjoy this one. While it's not exactly a classic, ""Rise Of The Planet of the Apes"" is a solid choice for movie night."
3,Rise of the Planet of the Apes-Blu-ray combo,Ever since I started buying Blu-rays I always have purchased the 2 disc combo(Blu-ray and DVD) It's Hard to go wrong with Blu-rays. Planet ot Apes was just anok movie though.
5,enjoyable,"I watched this with reserverations, I am not much on squeals, but this was a very nicesurprise. I enjoyed it."
2,Watch for the special effects and nothing more,"I decided to watch this movie because I saw the Mark Wahlberg ""Planet of the Apes"" and liked the concept. The only reason I didn't give this movie 1 star was because the special effects were so damn good.James Franco is a horrible actor, it's like he's made of wood. He displays no emotion, he's completely unbelievable as a scientist.There's nothing new here story wise. Main character makes mistake, gets the girl, tries to save the world. It's been done before.It might be worth it to see the special effects and computer imaging but other than that it was disappointing."
1,another installment offering the same lesson,"It's a pretty lousy movie, serving only to offer the same ""lesson"" as so many others -- it's the capitalist's fault. If the problem is political in nature, it's the capitalist's fault. If economic, also, the capitalist's fault. If the problem is scientific, it's also, still, the capitalist's fault. It's ALWAYS the capitalist's fault.As applied to fiction, the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" used to range far and wide over vast subjects ... but now, there's only one thing you need to set aside - the fact that most of the world's horrors were visited upon humanity by well-intentioned do-gooders, social utopians, or a combination thereof. Instead, you must always remember - it's ALWAYS the capitalist's fault."
3,I pulled so hard for the primates to win!!!!,"I didn't think the digital effort was great at all. The movement a lot of times was very unreal, and looked phony. The animals faces were okay at times, and some bad and un-natural at times, so in that regard, it was only passing to me. The one thing I found interesting was that I wanted the primates to WIN soooo badly. I found myself wanting them to kill off almost all human beings, and start over again to be truthful. I guess that tells me a lot about where our society has gone and how far down we've gone. The acting was just terrible also. We have the main Doctor science character not able to make you feel ""anything"" but how poor his effort is in acting. I don't know, but the movie never pulls it off, and never gets me to remotely believe this ever could happen, so the emotions are just not generated to make it a good flick...it was simply okay is all."
1,can not watch with ps3,"Bought the blu-ray but not able to watch it because it saying it needs encrypted new key update with ps3, I'm disabled and not able to hook my ps3 to internet for update, I wish Sony would put this updated on an availble dvd to update, not everyone can hook up there ps3 to the interenet or able to put it on a usb"
1,No sound = ripped off!,"I rented this movie in HD along with Cowboys and Aliens using my Roku and neither had any audio. I was able to view (and hear) the trailer before I rented. Ripped off, what a disappointment."
4,A very good movie!,Bought this DVD set to see the behind the scenes but there was very little of it. Probably would not have bought the DVD set if I had known that.
5,Awesome!,"I was first hesitant about watching this movie after the last couple of Planet of the Apes were butchered. I waited and listened to the reviews from everyone else and finally decided to give it a watch. The movie was incredible. Great story, great effects, and great cinematography. This is one of the best movies that I have seen in the last year or more."
5,This Movie Rocks,I can't say enough good things about this film. I went to see it in the theater this week and it delivers on all accounts. See the film if you're a planet of the apes fan.
1,Movie quality was horrible,This movie had issues. It the picture was very jerky and the words didnt match the picture. We deleted it and downloaded it again and got the same result. Requesting refund for both.
2,freakin awful,"if you like lots of animated apes, spend your money here on this one. my god can't hollywood think of anything new?"
2,Omg! Not the same ten years later!,Loved it when i had watched it when i was 13. But now that i am 26........It was bad. Soooo bad! There really wasn't a story line. It was just awful.
4,A great Movie,I was very pleased to find this movie on DVD. It was one of my favorites in High School! Thanks for the speedy and cost effective service!
2,Marginal rehash of existing javascript examples,"To begin with... I don't think this book is terrible. If you expect a book that takes a collection of beginner-intermediate Javascript examples from numerous sources without code enhancement that simply explains how each line works, this book is for you (good for beginners). If you want advanced Script examples... find something else to read. I've used one example from the book since I purchased it, and that had to be rewritten to the point where it was basically new code. I'd give this book 2 1/2 stars. My advice is to find a copy at a local book store and see if the code you need is there... if so, come back to Amazon and buy it. (Be aware that there are several good javascript sites with lots of code examples (www.javascript.com))"
3,Chupacabra Gurlz Gone Wild,"Bodacious babes behind bars, a full moon werewolf that would make Roger Corman feel all warm and mushy inside and some occasionally good cine work make this B-Schlock gore fest worth a look. It's Chupacabra Gurlz Gone Wild!"
4,Fun and Irony from Retro Group,"I bought this CD because I have alway loved the song 'Elenore' by the Turtles. Still, I found most of the songs entertaining though unfamiliar. The accompanying insert is quite entertaining as well, providing history and insights into the group and their motive for various lyrics. 'Elenore' was intended by the Turtles to be a flop to vent the group's anger at the artistic constraints imposed by the record label. Irony won out as the song became an popular hit. Now I appreciate it even more."
3,"Good selection of works, but poor quality recording","As I've found with most recordings in this series, the selection of works on this disc set is good - while there are certainly many more choices not included here, I can't really say any of those that were included are bad choices.The quality of the performances varies. Those works which I am more familiar with seemed to be of lower quality to me. The quality of the recording, however, is of poor quality - either a high level of static or a low level of recording volume contribute to a consistant background hiss when listening to this album. Headphones are not recommended with this set.If you're looking for an intro to choral works and might use this as a sampler or springboard, I'd recommend this set. However, there are better discs out there for that purpose or for just havings a variety of choral works."
2,worst album yet,"I am extremely disapointed by this album. I have been a BK fan since Sha Sha and have been looking forward to this album for a while, but it really doesn't live up to my expectations.I agree with previous reviews that said that this is mostly ballads and DOESN'T ROCK! What happened to songs like ""The Rules,"" ""Ann Disaster,"" ""No Reason,"" and ""Harriet's Got a Song""??The songwriting is also a lot less creative. Creative songs like ""Hospital Bed"" and ""Different But The Same"" are nowhere to be found on this album (with the semi-exception of ""Red Eye""--which is a highlight on the album). Instead, I have to listen to poppy ballads with conventional songwriting.Also, if you have ever searched LimeWire for Ben Kweller, you probably know the songs ""I Gotta Move,"" ""I Don't Know Why,"" and probably a few more from previous releases and live recordings of his. In my opinion, these songs are a weak cop-out he used to fill a full 11 tracks.Come on Ben, I know you can do better than this."
2,Dud...his worst outing so far,"Having heard all 3 Kweller releases now, I was hopeful that he'd take the crunchy power pop on ON MY WAY and further refine his songwriting style by toning down some of the willful goofiness while still linking it to solid melodies. In other words, somewhat of a power-pop Barenaked Ladies. His debut SHA SHA was a little too askew lyrically and too flailing musically but it appeared with ON MY WAY he was starting to move toward his own sound musically.On this one, there's not a lot of high energy material. It's weighted down with bland ballads that don't really inspire me. Outside of ""Run"" and ""I Gotta Move"", there's nothing that grabs my interest here. And as others have commented it's obvious they were going for a ""hit"" sound here as everything is ""slicked up"". If this direction continues, the next Kweller release won't be something I'll bother to seek out."
3,Shades of Black,"This book is about a celebration of children. The part I liked best was the girl was midnite blue. I chose this book because it helps me with reading. I learned these new words when I read this book: onyx and unique.By: D.B.Age 5, Los Angeles"
4,Brings out a lot,"My only problem with this book is some children look like they got the 1 drop rule in them, they don't even look biracial. It needs more dark skin Black children in the book. Otherwise I LOVE the book.I read this to my students (in a class of 24, 22 of them are Black) and came to realise many are uncomfortable about being Black, and they read this book on their own."
4,Songwriter at his best...,"Barry is first and foremost a songwriter,and this album epitomizes the very gift that is so much an integral part of him.Someone else usually does the lyrics.But can you listen if the MUSIC doesn't first capture the attention?That is precisely my point. It's the SOUND that pulls you in,that you actually HEAR,and then you listen to the lyrics.This album is another of Barry's in which he tells us a story and we are yet again captured...."
3,Kinda So-So,"The one thing I remember about this album was me trying to locate it. It took about three and a half years and when I did find it, it was in the most unlikely spot, under a bunch of discontinued albums. The very bottom one. I was so excited to have finally gotten it, then to get it home and I was like 'oh, bother', but anyway its still a Manilow album and I still have it."
3,muy buen disco!,"Bueno antes que nada aclaro que no es el mismo disco que conocia, al parecer el que me enviaron es una version diferente, de cualquier modo me gusto, aunque le faltan un par de canciones a este que me han enviado. gracias por tomar en cuenta los comentarios."
2,Disappointment,"The photographer should be praised for trying, but this effort falls short. The models are pretty great, but there should be more variety. The photography is uneven, with some good shots along with many that should have been edited out. The reproduction is AWFUL, with many pages being the quality of a Xerox. These guys dedicate the book to Bruce Weber, and they should take a page from how Bruce pays meticulous attention to the edit, design, and reproduction of his books."
2,Common sense material,"I mistakenly purchased this book hoping to get a better insight on entering contests and ""tips"" on playing the lottery. Steve might have won several contests, and that's great, but he's sure making a lot more money selling his common sense book."
4,"Good Info, even if not a perfect resource","Although this book is not perfect, you'd have a hard time finding one that is. When the topic of wining sweepstakes, contests and lotteries comes up, it's hard to create a perfect system for winning all the time since they're based on randomizing the winning entry.That said, the book does offer some useful tips on how to focus on the types of sweepstakes and contests that offer the best odds. The most important thing you will learn from this book is how to focus on sweeps with the best odds and how to give yourself a potential further advantage. Other than that, don't expect this book to give you a secret way of picking numbers for a lottery, or astrological/magical ways of finding the key. The advantages he talks about are strictly based on odds. Better odds = higher chances of winning."
4,PEBL FlexiSkin,"Nice product for a good price. The case developed a small tear along the seam line after just a few days but so far has remained small and doesn't affect the usage. The case has a cool feel and protects my phone well. Several people thought that it was a new phone not realizing it was a cover. The cover I bought was ""Future Blue"" and was very pretty. Motorola Q (1st Generation) FlexiSkin - The Soft Low-Profile Case (Jet Black (cut-out keyboard))"
1,"In cold weather, it's pealing off","I was originally very impressed with this product, and it ""looked"" like it would work well & hold up, and was hoping it'll do the trick. I was very careful to put it according to instructions, cleaned the area Very well first, walked over it many time to insure it's stuck real well, even stayed off driveway & parked on the street for several days. I applied the product when it was mild & does not go below 60 overnight, and it held up nicely UNTIL the cold weather rolled in. Once it went below freezing, half of what I put on my driveway pealed right off. Very disappointed & will see if there's a way to get my money back."
4,Cofair Asphalt Repair Fabric,I used this at the edge of the garage where the concrete meets the asphalt. It worked perfectly and looks very nice and tidy and was easy to apply. Thank you.
4,Hilarious!,"I can't vouch for the historical accuracy of this book, but it did make me laugh out loud at least twice per chapter.The author has a fine sense of the absurd, and he calls the reader's attention to many bizarre details of both the period and the players that serious historians might miss (or that I might miss, because I would never read them in the first place). I am tempted here to give examples, but I don't want to spoil his superb comic timing. Let's just say that the book includes a plot to kidnap a giant, an army of 6-year-olds, a couple of orgies, and many, many, many Johanns...I could care less whether any of it is true."
3,Enlightenment?,"This is a book on a wonderful topic, and it is enlightening in its detailed account of the two protagonists, Mr. Bach and Frederick the Great. The simple contrast of these two diametrically opposite lives is wonderfully fascinating.The account of the central event, Bach's encounter with Frederick and his writing of one of the greatest works of art ever produced by human hands, Bach's ""Musical Offering,"" is full of implications for life persistent questions. However, the grand themes presented here never quite come to full fruition -- the promise of enlightenment, never quite fulfilled.Still, this book gives more than ample fodder to continue the search."
3,A contrivance that left me disappointed,"I felt disappointed as I came to the end of this book, realizing the ""evening the in palace of reason"" was just a contrivance to write a book. I was expecting something more substantial to have happened that ""evening."" The alternating chapters of biographical material and discussion of Bach's works and times I thought were preparation to understand an encounter that evening that would add illumination to the two ages. Instead, the king just behaved meanly and Bach composed in response. Humpf.The book is good as far as I can tell delivering material on Bach and Frederick, but the premise fell flat.In the end, I was disappointed to have dragged myself through it. If I want a biography on Bach, I will read a biography on Bach. If I want a biography on Frederick, I will read a biography on Frederick. Putting the two together added nothing."
5,This album never gets old for me,"Almost eight years later, KOOP's ""Waltz for Koop"" album is still playing on my stereo. In my opinion, I think that this is still KOOP's best album. Whenever I listen to the arrangements and singing on this album, I'm transported back in time. The duo - Magnus Zingmark and Oscar Simonsson -- combines the classic elements of acid and lounge jazz with elements of electronica.Their retro sound is on point. The stunning soloists accentuate each song perfectly. Featured on this album, are the lovely voices Cecilia Stalin (Baby and Waltz for Koop) and Yukimi Nagano (on Summer Sun), the cool, beat poetry of Earl Zinger(Modal Mile) and soulful singing of Terry Callier (In a Heartbeat).No filler on this album. It is a wonderful album to chill and relax to, whether hosting a party for friends, winding down for the evening, or just to feel good. The Waltz for Koop remix album is just as fierce. Highly recommended."
3,Lounge Music from Germany of All Places,"This German group's music is quite entertaining and relaxing. Not as strong as Zero 7's Simple Things, but comparable to any 4Hero release.The various female singers interspersed throughout the CD add an ethereal quality that takes you back to a time when you were sunning yourself on a beach listening to the waves come crashing in.The melodies and orchestration is quite good, but I've heard better and more engaging."
4,smooth groove,"this disc is a solid compilation of some loungey jazz that deviates a little from the norm. not the most exciting and uplifting disc, but i enjoyed winding down from a hard day out with its mellow grooves. i recommend de phazz's death by chocolate if you're looking for something more upbeat, but still jazzy and fun. one thing...only 39 minutes long, which was rather disappointing."
4,An Acoustic Twist On Some Older Material,"Although I was hoping for new material to be included on this release, it was nice to hear familiar Winger and Kip Winger songs presented in a whole new way, acoustically. Kip is a very talanted musician and this is a wonderful showcase of that talent."
3,good but bad,well it was a good find.the only problem is if your a skinny guy you will need suspension straps. well this doesn't come with those.but the two i got still work wonders
3,Be serious about this read...,"If you're looking for a casual read on spirituality, save your money. This text is dated and quite sexist. Although it does explain in very good detail about consolations, etc. it seemed to me to be a serious read for catechism. The casual and protestant reader can easily get lost."
1,Dead Plot Fails to Reanimate,Too bad Mr. Kihn didn't have any original ideas. This is in part a bad novelization of 'Ed Wood' and in part just horrid horror writing. There's no mystery. There's no thrill.
2,One of my 4000 Books,"Schweizer attempts to show how the theology of the Jewish believers shifted when it encountered Greek thinking. There were a few gems in the book, but overall, I found his train of thought difficult to follow. (And he is usually an excellent writer. His entries in the Theological Dictionary of the New Testament are superb!)"
4,War is hell,"Ron Kovic suffered horrific damage in battle. Then he came home to even worse treatment from the Veterans Administration. And then he realized it was all for ... no reason worth fighting and dying for.I'll be blunt: Kovic is a mediocre writer. He rambles and re-hashes. However, he has something to say, and it is damn well worth your attention and consideration -- doubly so if you are thinking about joining the armed services of your country."
2,A Mediocre Story about Shallow People.,"I read this book with a group of both men and women, and we were all rather disappointed - some by the uniformity of the writing style even when the narrator changed, others with the underdeveloped characterization and utter disregard of the protagonists for their children, still others for the lack of cultural insight revealed within the story. Personally, I liked it; but it was frustrating because, while the book was easy to read, the author's point was never quite clear. I think I was supposed to sympathize for women living in an ultra-conservative, male-dominated society, but the thread I mainly noticed was that selfish people are never happy. Perhaps the arid, Middle-Eastern setting supplied an accidental allegory, reminding the reader that without love, any country can be a desert."
3,Benchmade 940 .. not so sharp,"Ordered a Benchmade 940, NIB. First Benchmade I've bought, probably also the last. Out of the box, the blade was dull. I could run my finger down the edge. For a knife that retails at $200, this was as much as a disappointment as it was unacceptable, in my opinion. The packaging was nice, presentation even better .. fit and finish seemed well done. The axis lock was a bit stiff to operate and I found it jammed or rather, maybe a better way to describe it .. when pulling the lock backwards to release the blade, the lock got stuck and the blade was not able to lock up properly. The look and design definitely catch your eye, after having the knife in hand, well .. thats a different story, for me anyways."
5,had to have another one,"In one of the worst events of my life, I lost my first osborne. After years of searching high and low in my house. I broke down and bought another. In between the event, i purchased several knives of supposed high quality but ultimately lower quality. I thought I was just smitten with the benchmade name, but after I got my second, I was assured that this was the knife I thought it was. Incredibly sharp out of the box, no lateral or vertical play, incredible action and the best lock there is.Get this knife, you will not be disappointed. Then buy yourself a nice set of stones or the best sharpening system you can get and take care of this and all of your knives."
1,Total bust and totally forgettable,"If you are after an exciting sub novel, grab an earlier Robinson. After his first three, he should have stopped writing."
3,"Tedious, but worth the wait","I liked this book, but for the first 3/4 of the book, the author gave us too much information. When the action that was planned in the first part of the book finally started, I could not put the book down."
2,A hard to believe plot,"Just completed listening to the abridged audiobook of Hunter Killer (by Patrick Robinson). Set in the current world, the plot is, unfortunately, not very believeable. It is a bit hard to get into a story where a Saudi prince secretly cuts a deal with the government of France to overthrow the king in return for exclusive rights to sell their oil on the world market. In the book, the French just say, Sure, let's do it. Add a couple of French subs and poof, you have an overthrow.Sorry, this ain't no Clancy novel in quality or story. It was short (5 CDs) and interesting when you ignore the main plotline. Not up to Robinson's usual standard for story quality. I'd pass on this one."
1,It`s a very terrible seller because the seller is NOT HONEST !!!,"The book had been used more than 80%, but the seller still said the book`s condition is very good. However, I have to say that the seller is a NASTY SELLER because the seller used pen to write on the book.So, DO NOT BUY ANY THINGS FROM THIS TERRIBLE SELLER.THIS SELLER MUST BE THE WOREST SELLER I EVER MET."
5,Already been said...,"You know, I was anticipating logging on a leaving a stellar review that would introduce others to Mr. Hunt. It appears that everything I was gonna write, has already been said by others. So I will co-sign all of the other highly-positive reviews by saying, GO GET THIS ALBUM!!!"
3,Good -- but not as amazing as his first!,"This was a good cd. His first cd blew me away though -- so it was hard to judge this one. His voice is so unique and calming. If this cd was done alone, I would have said 'o yes, this is hot'. But comparing to the first one? Its ok. My favorite songs are1:Being A Girl2:Hot Stage Lights3:Ride,Ride,Ride - thought i put the wrong song on my ipod lol, TOTALLY different, wow4:Priest of Police.Mean Sleep was definitely done better by Lenny Kravitz and Cree Summer :-|. Van was good - Nikka (I LOVE her) but she just wasn't right for that song."
3,Could be Much More.....,"I was disappointed when I listened to this CD for the 1st time. I guess I was expecting alot more like the first CD (tracks like Her Decemeber, Hold My Hand, Out of the Sky.....)It is certainly different! It will take some use to getting use to. His 1st CD had a great mixture of songs...where this CD throughout sounds more like Lenny K and Prince. I was looking for much more......a variety!"
2,Full Cry //Audio (I almost did),"I have always enjoyed Rita Mae Brown's work. That being said, and yes, this story line does wear abit thin, but the worst, unforgivable sin is that she read the story herself. It was awful. Several times she will start a sentence, only to stop and restart after a few words. There was no feeling of character in her voice. Yoy can hear her swallow and clear her throat, so I guess it's the production values that are the biggest offender."
5,A Great Summary,"It is a rare book that can effectively summarize a long war and a longer historical process in a short space, yet this book does so with gem-like clarity. It is also extraordinarily evenhanded--a great accomplishment given the depth of feeling surrounding the war. The text weaves various perspectives into the narrative so well that I always felt unimpeded by bias and appreciative of its broad objectivity. The author keeps the larger focus on the main political and military issues which shaped the war yet always includes enough detail to give a strong sense of what was taking place both in policy circles and on the ground. The author has cleary mastered a great deal of material and keeps to the facts, yet through it I was deeply moved. I think there is a subtle tone to the book of compassion for human tragedy that makes it not just highly readable but important to all of us who struggle to understand human events, and particularly this war."
3,Uneven,"It is ironic that despite the rejoining of Martin Carthy, Steeleye's 10th album is, perhaps, their weakest overall. The problem is that several of the songs (""Awake, Awake"" is a good example) just aren't very interesting. While the vocal harmonies on ""Sweep, Chimney Sweep"" are as solid as ever, the song isn't melodically exciting.While ""Some Rival,"" and ""The Black Freighter"" manage to help rescue the album from tedium, it is ""The Victory"" that single-handedly results in the album getting a third star. With Maddy Prior's vocals firmly in control, it alone is worth the price of admission, although clearly this is not an album to recommend for a first Steeleye purchase."
5,good fast service,"good fast service, the company sent my order express free of charge. really nice of them to do that. thanks alot"
4,How r u feeling today,The poster serves as a great reminder of the many different moods we experience on a daily basis.I also use it as a tool to address these moods whenever they appear and try to keep them in check.
3,Power plug placement hampers a good device,"This is a great fridge for use in a truck or SUV. Large size for a long road trip with a lot of people. However, I find I always use my smaller cooler and not this one because of the plug design. The power plug is in the back of the device in the center. It interfears with being able to put the back of the fridge against a seat, door or wall."
3,SOMEWHAT HELPFUL,"My personal opinion of the book is that I was a little disappointed. I was looking for a revelation or a solution. I did get a few ideas and tactics for coping with those who continue to impose themselves on you. However, if those don't work you wind up compromising yourself."
5,MIDLIFE A MANUAL,"I enjoyed reading Midlife, A Manual. It covered many of the topics I am facing in my life as a 47 year old mother of four, with adult children leaving the nest, aging parents, retirement in the near future and investment planning. I enjoyed the humor and wit that softens the blows of life's harsh edges. The accounts of personal experience's were wonderful to read, it made me feel less isolated, knowing there are many of us facing these issues. The authors gave terrific useful information and step by step guidlines to take regarding the facing issues. It was a good read and gave helpful ideas."
5,Excellent read!,Great book! I thought it was well written. Author gives lots of great examples from real life! Excellent textbook!
2,too red-hot!,"This book is chock full of cutesy icons and useless advice. The author spends far too much time touting her previous book (resumes for dummies) and dispensing annoying catch phrases as opposed to giving solid writing tips. We've recieved letters like those featured in the book and dumped them directly in the trash. Unless you are applying for a sales job at a used car lot, don't bother using the letters in this book."
2,We do not need an entire book on cover letters,"While the companion volume, ""Resumes for dummies"" is excellent and well worth your time and money, this book does not justify itself. It could easily have been condensed into a few chapters and added to the resumes volume. ""Resumes AND cover letters for dummies"" would have made sense. I bought the resumes volume and am glad I did. I spent an entire weekend reading it and picking up excellent hints that dramtically improved my resume. I was able to peruse this book in 30 minutes at the bookstore, however. If you know how to write a simple business letter, you do not need this book. Definitely get the resumes volume, though."
1,Seller is a novice,You always put the tracks in an album. This seller assumes that the potential buyers have psychic powers & can guess the tracks.
4,Good Amp,"This amp is cool to look at, it is much better than the previous one where the volume was motorized. That was hard to get the volume to stop where you wanted it, also it was made in Korea and the quality is better in this China amp. It doesn't drive long RCA output loads real well. It's output impedance must be 1200 ohms or more, so it's not as high quality as the older Apt/Holman stuff. Has a nice power output and not much in the way of gimmicks. I would buy it again."
1,sucks,bad good movie better than expected i do not understand why it gets all of the un needed hated so great movie five stars.
1,"So bad, it's bad","I wish I had listened to the rotten tomatoes reviews; this movie was terrible. Save your money, or better yet; rent ""Adventures in Babysitting""."
2,Not worth the time or money,"Really, if I had not paid to see this movie I would of turned it off about 15mins in to it... If you have seen the preview than you have seen the best of the movie. I am giving it 2 stars because there was a funny part here and there BUT again, 90% of that I seen in the previews."
2,was ok till i shut it off mid way thru,"i like some of hills movies and the previews lookd really funny,but when me and my gf sat down to watch it i started to think boy this movie is terrible, it did have its funny parts and how he tells off the kids was funny but the laughs soon stopped and felt like it was dragging about 40 mins in so i shut it off. wish i rented it first b4 i bought it"
1,Who was this movie for?,"This movie left a lot to be desired. It wasn't funny. There wasn't one original twist. It wasn't for children while being about children. Right from the first scene I kind of hated it and the feeling never left. It's one of those movies that is just a huge waste of time and talent. I watch a movie like this and can't help but thinking how many people gave it the OK and wonder why no one stopped and said, ""Hey, this kind of sucks...let's rewrite this and make it something enjoyable."" What a waste of money."
1,Grossly Disappointing,"I watched this film on a recommendation from my bro-in-law, and didn't expect to be impressed because his sense of humor is odd. This film tries to be funny and it fails. It tries to be meaningful and sentimental and it fails. It tries to be sensitive to homosexuals and comes across as pedantic. Please do yourself a favor and do not watch this film"
1,"Should be called ""The Stinker""","Amateurish thrown-together stinker with no plot, no sense, nothing funny, and the nerve to wax philosophical at the end. Must have taken all of a week and $700 to throw together. It's like ""well what shall we shoot today? I know ... let's meet black thugs in an alley!"" Even teenagers who love fart jokes will hate this stinker."
2,Why couldn't this have been better?,"Movies like this have been done repeatedly and done better starting with ""Adventures in Babysitting."" The movie is mediocre at best due to Jonah Hill's performance, but even he can't save this mess of a script. This isn't a film for kids even though it's called ""The Sitter"". It's one ridiculous scenario after another and is lacking in humor. It's so outlandish and beyond believable that you'll find yourself rolling your eyes with annoyance at the absurdity. There's so much going on from one scene to the next that you're curiosity rides with it until you realize its just not going to get any better than this."
2,Dissapointed,"I was pretty highly disappointed in this movie. Jonah Hill is one of my favorite comedic actors, and the script just really wasn't that funny. I had high hopes that were not met."
2,Blah,"Big Jonah Hill fan but this movie is not good at all. It reminds me of the ""Adventures of Babysitting"" but far worse."
3,Weak,"First this is an excellent kindle edition as it is true to the original and contains no scanning errors also it contains copies of the original artwork which can be zoomed to view in addition there is a glossary which contains words or phrases not in common use now but were widely used America in the 1930/40s. Also included in the book complete with photographs is a comprehensive biography of L Ron Hubbard. There is also a preview of another L. Ron Hubbard story ""Hostage to Death""The actual story is typical of the type written at the time when authors had to bash out stories in minimal time to meet editor's time scales and often paid by the word. I have now read 3 of these books and this is by far the weakest the whole plot revolves around the hero of the book Blacky Lee, a confidence trickster, being identical to the arch Duke and impersonating him, not much else .Worth reading if only to get a flavour of this type of book."
5,Great Gift Idea,Gave as a gift for Christmas (by request). It was a hit. The recipient couldn't put it down and I could hear her laughing as she read. Best price by far on Amazon - especially compared to retail.
3,Not for me,"I was disappointed with this CD...not because it is flawed, just that it doesn't suit my need. I previously owned The Most Holy Rosary, by Dr. Scott Hahn and I loved it. When I wore it out, I needed a new one and purchased this CD, The Rosary Is a Place. It is filled with way too much singing/dialogue for my taste and doesn't get to the actual reciting of the rosary. Not that the Lord isn't worthy of hours of my undivided attention. But I like to listen to it in the car on my way to work, and having a short commute, I prefer a CD that gets right to the point...and that is saying the rosary. By the time the singing/talking is done and they start a decade of the rosary, I'm at work.I am in no way bashing this CD...I'm sure it is perfect for some people. It's just not suited for what I am looking for."
4,Port Authority Competitor Jacket,This jacket just suited our purpose. Looks good. Feels good. Light weight but warm. The description given by the vendor I found to be accurate.
3,Port Authority Jacket JP54,"Just received this purchase today and I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The jacket reflects the image that was displayed, fits and looks well. But there is no way this jacket can stand up to the harsh New England winters, I thought this was a warm winter work jacket and it is three season at best. Will keep for the fall and early spring and see how it holds up. But for less than $40.00 I guess you get what you pay for."
2,what a boring bitter old man!,"patrick white is one of the 20th century's finest novelists - his thick tome of letters compiled by david marr was given to me by someone who knew of patrick white only as a writer from my country- I was living in TX at the time feeling acute homesickness of which, upon reading the book, was immediately cured by page 2 when the reasons why I left australia in the first place came vividly galloping towards me with a loud yawn. The scratchy nib of discontentment mark 400 pages of this old sod's rather boring snippy life with his companion manoly. His mandarin mouthed mug scowling at u courtesy of the brush strokes of Brett on the cover really tell u the whole sad story .. dinner parties, gossip, gardening, writing, gossip, travelling, bitching, writing etc go on and on -- most telling aspect is that patrick wanted all his correspondence destroyed after being read - obviously not enough of his friends took him seriously - so why should we ..."
2,Broke very quickly.,The part you connect to the Bow String fell off on the 2nd use on the first bow. Then it fell off the 2nd arrow on about the 7th use. Very disappointed and will not be ordering again. Not worth the cost to return them.
2,"Tough, but too heavy","I bought these for my granddaughter to learn on. They seem to be designed to be bulletproof, not to be shot from a child's bow. Way, way too heavy."
5,Most Popular Freestyle Song!!,I never get tired of hearing this song. Four different versions and they are all great. In my opinion this song is representative of the Freestyle Music Genre. Judy is the best and has the most sexy voice too.I feel very fortunate to have seen her perform just once many years ago.She was full of energy and has the best personality. Only good things to say about her career. I love her very very much.My most favorite female vocalist.
3,Irish (Not So) Gold,"I hate to be the only negative voice in a chorus of enthusiastic reviews but, if the story of Michael Collins hadn't been involved, this book would have made me gag before I got through the first fifty pages. I found the cutsey ""Irish"" dialogue to be cloying and the perfection of the heroine, gushingly described at every opportunity, to be not only unbelievable but irritating. Both of these flaws interfered with the smooth flow of the story, which, without them, would have been pretty engrossing."
2,I didn't like it !!!,"Somehow I just didn't like ""Irish Gold"". It was a gift, and I can see why people like it, with all the great reviews, but I just didn't. Something with Greeley's writing style did not go well with me. It was an easy read--but all the history stuff confused me at times--so many people and events, it was like, are you in the past or present? I thought the plot & events were good, but I just really did not like this book. A lot of people might, though."
2,Very odd shoes,These shoes are extremely tight and small and I have very petite feet. They are shaped funny and just are silly. No issues with shipping. I plan to return.
4,Cute Sneakers!,"These are cute, kind of vintage looking sneakers, and pretty comfortable.I got them for work, I'm walking and on my feet all day, and they have been great.Also get lots of compliments on them."
5,Amazing Shoe,"The shoe is revolutionary in my eyes, the focus on being animal-product free shows a lot of care and how they still managed to make the show so comfortable and supportive is mind blowing. Definitely a game changer."
5,THAT'S COUNTRY!,"In these times real good Country-music comes not from Nashville!!The best stuff I found today,was in the Austin-scene and Gary P.Nunn was an Icon in it!It's a shame,that singers like him are so rare on CD!When you hear his songs you can smell Texas,believe it!When you like Kristofferson or Nelson,dig a CD from Gary P.Nunn and you can't be wrong."
2,My review,"I got it on yellow and i think is to wide, the front wheel doesn't swivel. I didn't realize that when I bought it. If you jog in an area where you are turning corners, it's kind of a pain because you have to pivot it around on the back wheels, the fabric to hard and the belts are odd. the color is yellow but it has a slit orage yo it.How can I return this, i open the box would this affect my refund?"
4,Not just for kids!,"Fire in the fireplace, warm cider in your mug, snow falling gently outside...well, ok, even if you don't have all of these at Christmas, this warm, comforting, sometimes contemplative Christmas album will bring that same feeling. Though her voice does sound strained on a couple of tracks, the rest of the album is great. The first track, In the Bleak Mid-Winter, is the most hauntingly beautiful Christmas song I have ever heard. If you don't have kids, don't let the lullaby part put you off -- this is a great disc."
4,Relax,"Soft, beautiful songs sung by the great Shawn Colvin. Listening to these songs gives you a very cozy feeling. ""In The Bleak Mid-Winter"" is a classic."
4,An Instant Christmas Favorite,"After all the hustle and bustle is finished for the day, gather your family around and put this CD on. Shawn's voice combined with the hauntingly beautiful lyrics and music instantly places you in a warm and tranquil state of mind. The whole CD is enjoyable from beginning to end but 'In The Bleak Mid-Winter', 'Rocking' and 'Love Came Down At Christmas' are standouts. I played the CD five times straight after it came in the mail. A beautiful Christmas CD but I plan on listening to it all year."
1,Rowenta Power Duo problems,"Dont waste your money, this iron worked great in the beginning but with less than 6 months of using it and trust me we do not iron that often, this started dripping water. First noticed as I sat it upright to cool down and returned to find it sitting in a puddle of water. Hasnt worked right since and the steam is not up to par. No reason for the problem as it has never been dropped or knocked around."
1,LEAKS EVERYWHERE!!!,"This iron is terrible!!! It leaks all over the clothes while ironing, and when you're finished, you'd better put it in the sink or it will leave a huge puddle wherever you leave it!"
3,Good introduction....,"This was my first Stereolab purchase, so I kind of have a soft spot for it. I must admit I am fan of Stereolab's earlier work, preferring the drone/guitar phase better than the later loungey phase that really started after this record. This one is a mixed bag, but it does contain one of my favourite Stereolab tracks (Nihilist Assault Group, the other being Stomach Worm from Peng! & the first 8 or so minutes of Jenny Ondioline from Transient...) as well as other great droney tracks like Transona Five. Overall it is a fine listen & I feel a good introduction for first time listeners.Note that Amazon are now listing this as a CDR on demand purchase, so I would recommend sourcing a real copy either used or real from elsewhere."
3,Pure pop propulsive prowess,3 1/2Stereolab's early-career peak of accessibility is overlong (particularly a relatively downbeat second side) but still nearly as enticing as anything the still-undervalued group has served up.
1,Ridiculous.,"A friend of mine told me that this CD was a ""work"" primarily based on repeating the same interval of notes, only with different notes themselves, for the entire CD! Now, I don't know exactly what that means, but I don't have to know to recognize the sort of ""artistic"" doublespeak that exists nowadays for ""artists"" to try to justify their garbage they think is ""art."" How can one recording be the same thing over and over? I'm sure that any residents of the local art school would be interested in trying to answer that one. Finally, I decided to listen to the ""Stereo Lab"" CD itself. Well, the band's name sounds like the records we used to use to test our Hi-Fi record players, and this band isn't any more interesting than that at all."
2,"Not a ""Definitive"" Collection!!","Where is one of my favorite Dawn singles, ""Cupid""?This is NOT a definitve collection."
4,Top of The Top 15,A wonderful name book Creative and great Lamsky is King and I still love all the crazy spellings.
5,Excellent for Behavior based questioning,"I currently work for a Fortune 500 company in training. We are using this book as a reference in preparing our entry level personnel to interview internally for next level positions. Behavior based questioning is very popular right now and this book is excellent. Also has some good tips on salary negotiation,headhunters,follow-up, etc."
3,Meyy Axemas Vol 2,"Has some great tracks and others not so great. The good tracks emmulate Christmas, while others use it for another jam fest. Not nearly as good as Merry Axemas Vol 1."
4,Good holiday music - instrumental guitar,As a guitarist I appreciate good instrumental work. This is perfect for running in background. Running it in the car.
5,awesome cd,This is a great addition to any CD collection. I would highly recommend this CD for anyone who likes this artist.
5,BEST. CD. EVER!!!,I LOVE THIS CD!!!!! This CD is just awesome! MercyMe's lyrics are so touching and really express our desire to worship God. My favorite songs on here are: How Great Is Your Love and I Worship You. Buy this CD!!!
5,Almost There,Mercy Me is much more than a Christian Band. They deliver messages from God that are powerful and exciting for all ages.Seeing them in worship/concert will make you cry with joy.
2,Overrated and overplayed,"I think Mercy Me is just okay. They're not bad, but they'renot that great either. I Can Only Imagine is one of themost overrated and overplayed songs of the past few years.There have been a lot of really good songs about heaven,and I Can Only Imagine is a mediocre one at best.For some good rockin worship, get 1000 Generations by VineyardMusic."
4,Vietnam War as Seen Through the Prism of John P. Vann,"Vietnam was a complex and divisive war, one which has had longlasting effects on American culture. Our longest conflict, it was an epic struggle in which the US tried to prevent the southern half of the country from being unified with the Communist north after the departure of the French in 1954. In doing so we ended up propping up a corrupt south that was badly fractured by ethnic, political and religious rivalries. Through the character of John Paul Vann, who came to Vietnam as an Army advisor in 1962 and was finally shipped home in a coffin after he repulsed a large North Vietnamese force in 1972, Sheehan reveals the tainted struggle over Vietnam that he witnessed as a journalist and as a close friend of the brilliant, brave and fatally compulsive Vann."
5,A Look Back,"I wish I had known then what I read now. It seems that history is repeating itself, just as we have been told. Politicians and those who would lead us should read and heed this book.Vietnam Vet"
1,"really, really bad","This cd is soooo disapointing. If want some tight beats go buy Destiny's Childs new cd. The only two good tracks on it are Trippin and Sittin Home, so buy the singles."
2,totaly missing,"I had to break out my old total cuts to keep the faith. I'm still a fan and i'm keeping the faith but on this album I had to keep it realTotal I got much love,but I gots to go"
4,This is TOTALlly amazing!!!,"beats , kool lyrics , top class production & excellent special guests total deliver a nice slice of strong female r'n'b. this album is 2 steps up from their self-titled debut way back in 1996The beats on this record are totally tyte for example - if you want to , what about us remix , trippin , rock track are just a few that i will mention.my fave track has to be rock track it features edgy singing with a real mature urban rock beatthe only tracks that take the album down a star are number 4 &10 there is no need for that stupidness on the album. although the tracks are kinda funny. for anyone with doubts about buying this album think again and cop it ya heard!!!"
1,What ever happened...,to groups that can really sing?Do not waste your money on these no singing young ladies!
1,testosterone and boredome,"The only interesting part is that regarding the skills of Kirk against Picard: two of the most different starfleet captain engaged in a battle against one another, where the only goal is that of inflicting the lowest damage.The story is virtually inexistent, it seems there's nothing more to say... but Shatner says it anyway"
3,What glory?,"William Shatner is my favorite audio book author. That stated, even he couldn't bring me to like this audio book like he did the first 4 starting with The Return. The storyline just seemed to be missing something and I was bored. Don't bother getting this if you want to be enthralled and captivated by his words-get the earlier audio books-not this or Captain's Blood either."
2,Very generic.,"Though I don't like to give books bad reviews, I must with this one. It is the same old story (Kirk saving the day, etc.). I HATE the way that Janeway acts in this book (very annoying and pompous) and am very glad that the Totality storyline is over. It is also ridiculous that McCoy is still alive (though a nebulous explanation is given for the reason why). Naturally, Spock is not dead either. I tend to place WS's books in an alternate TREK universe, myself. Buy this book only in a bargain bin sale, etc."
4,Great live disc,"This was the last show of this tour and with Tommy Caldwell on bass. Sadly, he died shortly after this. The band is strong and sounds good. I still think Stompin' Room Only is a better CD, but diehards should have no problem adding this to the collection."
5,Favorite Children's Christmas Book,"This is my favorite children's Christmas book. In a very simple, sweet way brings across the idea that it is just as rewarding to give as to receive and at the same time is just a fun, cute book. Funny illustrations. My boys and I have had many discussions triggered by this book. I have recommend it to everyone I know who has little kids."
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I didn't know what to expect from this film. I haven't shot black & white film in over 20 years, and then it was with Kodak. HP5 has a pleasant grain, and a slight sepia to the prints. I like it a lot and will order more for my next vacation. I use film for special shots, but mainly shoot digital.[...]"
3,10 month boots,"Did airborne school with this boots got to Bragg, deployed about 1 month later. Had to buy a new pair about 9 months into deployment in Afghanistan .. still currently here. They are comfortable boots, they really don't breath all that well. Tear apart pretty quickly. As an 11b and rolling out every day i would recommend trying to buy a different pair that hold together a little longer."
3,Garrison boots at best,"I'm a US Army Infantryman+++These boots are extremely comfortable, I bought them after being extremely impressed by the comfortThey're relatively lightweightNever had a major blister from these bootsEasy wear inThey look cool (depends who you are on this one)---THEY ARE HORRIBLE WHEN WETI realize these are a desert boot but it would be nice to step in a puddle and not get wet feetToo hot, these things make my feet sweat bad and my feet normally run coldTAKE FOREVER TO DRYI personally get shin splints from these on longer ruck marchesOverall:I'd never buy these boots again. Right now I use them solely in garrison. I use a pair of the issue desert Altamas for times when I need to run/ruck since they are feather light. For field ops I have pair of gore-tex uninsulated Bellville 790s."
4,Buena colecciÃ³n de cuentos,Es una colecciÃ³n de seis cuentos cortos. La narrativa de Vargas Llosa es como siempre muy descriptiva y gusta de mantener en suspenso al lector. Ampliamente recomendado.
3,Don't even recognize Delius in this piece,"I am so used to the wonderful symphonic miniatures of Delius that I was shocked by this concerto. It does not even seem like him. I had hoped for something lyrical and light and sweet like his miniatures like In a summer Garden. This is not a very good concerto, worth it if you are curious. The Ireland piece you will like if you like Prokofiev concertos. It's modern and romps up and down the keyboard but neither concerto is memorable."
4,takes you back,"this compilation of sniff,n,the tears will take you back to the late 1970s,when studio 54 was hot and new wave started to hit the scene in the us,this british group broke ground with its smokin hits such as drivers seat, this song was number 14 in 1979 while hot then it made a comeback in the boogie nights movie.sniff,n,the,tears music almost went unavailable for a few years,but could hardly be forgotten, with all of the 70s trends(of course those days couldnt possibly be relived)listening to this groovy group of sniff,n,the tears best will certainly bring back memories,this kind of music is timeless,i highly recommend this cd."
5,It's Just Perfect,"What I enjoy about Peter White's music is that so often his CDs combine his familiar rhythmic style with well-loved R&B; tunes from the 70's as well as a melodic surprise or two. While this CD doesn't contain any retrospectives from the 70's, it is full of pieces with well developed structure and harmonious melodies. The surprise for me on Perfect Moment was finding three tracks that seemed to present themselves as being more than just ""smooth."" Another Rainy Day, The View From Your Window & Windy City are truly standouts! Each has layers and texture that make them more than just everyday radio fare.I recommend it highly."
3,Jewelers Screwdriver Set,This set of jewelers screwdrivers is of good quality; for me its only shortcoming is not including a #00 phillips screwdriver.
2,Not for jewerly,"I bought this set for my husband to remove links from his new watch band. The description says ""Jewelers"" set, but the packaging says ""Electronics"". They are too big for jewerly use. It is probably a good quality set, but I wish the title for the item matched what it really is."
5,Hardcore Prison Tales,"The book is very well written and not at all dated. Best Prison book I've read. Extremely honest. Deals with race wars, sexual predators, murder...This guy doesn't make excuses, he just tells it how it is. He admits that he was a guy who didn't want to work so he did liquor store robberies. Every time he got out of prison, the first thing he did was get caught for something & sent back. He was in prision during the time that the Mexican Mafia was starting and has some interesting insight on that. Very involved in race wars and riots. It's interesting how he moves from institution to institution (San Quentin, Tracy, LA County, among others) and always runs into cons that he knows. This guy was so bad that he got moved from a juvenile facility to San Quentin at the age of 16. An all around bad guy. Great read."
5,I simply love this simplified method of speaking a different language!,I simply love this simplified method of speaking a different language! I plan to keep going higher in the lessons. Pimsluer has my vote! And I was happy the cost was reduced as well! New or used the quality has always been acceptable.
3,Buy this item with a grammer book!,"I bought this Spanish fully audio set including 5 cds. There is no problem with packacing. Everthing is nice but I played the cds with Windows Media Player and you are just listening the cds, you can`t see what you are listening and damn just lestening.You have to study this language before or taking some courses related to this language or you must have at least a basic knowledge about this language. So, you will have the opportunity to use the cds effectively. I bought both Spanish and Italian and I have a basic Italian knowledge and I listened cds easily and understand them. But again you won`t be able to see what you are listening to. It`s bad.At least the cds must have been opened in a program and you select the lessons and it must have provided the chance what you are listening to.You need a grammer book with this set. That`s all I can say."
2,Not a quality film,"This movie seemed like it would have a good plot, but it was weak. Had a good cast so I was expecting more, but weak film..."
4,A good twisted tale,From the buzz of this movie it made me want to check it out- and I'm glad I did. Julianne Moore is fantastic in this movie- along with Liam Neeson and Amanda Seyfried. A twisted tale but predictible the same- still great to at least see once.
3,Don't take it too seriously,"An enjoyable movie. I can understand all the praise but really couldn't take it too seriously. In skiing parlance, I keep thinking of Moore paying to get her husband seduced but ending up (by mistake perhaps) with a ""Family Pass"" - albeit the season closed early. At least one closure that they can't blame on Global Warming."
2,"Predictable, predictable, predictable","Oh, brother. I thought we'd seen the last of the ""Fatal Attraction"" movies about psychotic lovers, crazed babysitters, whacked-out Lesbian writers, etc. that terrorize those oh-so-perfect suburban marriages.Then, along comes ""Chloe"". This movie telegraphs its predictable plot twists from the first scene. Without giving away ""spoilers"", I can say that I had the progression of events figured out within the first half-hour. I have to say I felt some disappointment seeing Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore in the kind of ""adultery melodrama"" that the Lifetime channel regularly delivers.Prurient in ways mostly involving money and class distinction, these movies are very cynical and unimaginative. It didn't do much at the box office, though, which means that maybe people have finally had enough of these predictable potboilers."
3,"Great Cast, Ok Movie, Probably Not For Guys","Catherine has been suspicious of her husband for quite a while. She pays an escort, named Chloe, to go find whether or not her husband has been cheating on her. The plan goes horribly wrong. David, Chloe, and Catherine find themselves caught up in a vicious love triangle. It's like Fatal Attraction plus one.This movie has an interesting premise and some great actors, but failed to really get me excited about it. I guess it's not really a guy movie. If your a woman and enjoy serious soap opera type drama then this movie will probably make you happy. If your'e looking for something more than that, then you'll probably find it kinda boring. This movie is definitely geared toward females. It's kinda hard to be objective since this film is geared toward an audience that probably doesn't include me, but I think I can see most women really getting a kick out of this one."
2,Not Liam's best work,"It was painfully obvious that this movie needed so much work done to it. It was icky, boring and downright disgusting at times. Had potential but didn't follow through."
3,Not Carnegie Hall!!,"I am a big Gilberto Santa Rosa fan and i do believe he has a great singing voice. This CD even though I feel its a good CD i wouldnt call it great. En Vivo Desde El Carnegie Hall is a Great Live CD. This one feels like he needed to put out a CD for whatever reason. If you like Gilbertito you will like this cd but you wont love this cd, I would be so bold to say that this is one you could live with out. But if you are like me and you must own every CD by him then go for it."
2,NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT,"Gilberto is an adequate singer, not a musician nor an arranger or composer. The symphonic Salsa idea is just an ego trip. In contrast, symphonic Salsa works by Ruben Blades and/or Willie Colon are worth taking the time. Ruben did Maestra Vida I & IIwith Colon producing. Colon did Baquine and Solo with symponic orchestrations that are musically interesting yet show a grasp and knowledge of the genre because they just swing! Get the real deal."
5,Frank should be honored,"Although there is probably no one who can sing these songs quite like Frank, Barry does an excellent job of it and could possibly be , the only singer today who could do justice to them. Worth giving a listen to again and again."
5,AWESOME!!,"Manilow has done it again! Manilow does a terrific job of paying tribute to Sinatra without imitating him. As an added bonus, we're treated to two new Manilow songs - One Man In the Spotlight and Here's To The Man. A must for all Manilow and/or Sinatra fans. You're gonna love this CD--All The Way!!"
2,Very Average!,"I Dig Barry Manilow&Frank Sinatra alot as Artists but this doesn't work.I don't know if it's the vibe or the way I'm use to them doing there own thing but this never gets off the ground for me fully.but I give Barry Props for making the effort.""Strangers in the Night"" has a interesting arrangement though here.but overall it's a very ordinary record to me."
5,A Must-Have For Barry Manilow Fans,"This CD is really great. Barry Manilow recreates the songs of Sinatra without trying to be Sinatra. He brings the beautiful songs of Frank Sinatra to life with his ""classic Barry"" voice."
3,"Not a bad album, but not his best either.","I have been a Manilow fan since ""Looks Like We Made It"" hit the charts in 1976. I have just about all the albums, videos, and memorabilia a Manilow ""maniac"" could want. But I was somewhat let down with this latest project. His voice and arrangement of the Sinatra songs were no doubt great and I especially loved his arrangement of ""Strangers In the Night"", but Barry needs to record a new pop album with new material and not do another album of ""other songwriter's material""...such as ""Summer of '78"", ""Big Band Album"", and ""Showstoppers."" Yes, I even own these albums and Barry did a splendid job on these as well, but it's been 10 years since he's had a CD with all new material. Maybe the upcoming ""Mayflower"" will put him back on the Billboard Charts."
1,"Hi there I', not sure if thsi is inslult or tribute...","I don't think barry Manilow recorded this to spite frank Siantra's memory on purpose, he may have meant well, but in any case this is more of an insult to Sinatra, than a tribute. Siantra was all about swing, and Barry hasn't a swingin' bone in his body.I hope all of you find this info. helpful on making a decision, i can't stress enough that you SHOULDN'T buy this cd."
3,"New Manilow CD, But No New Pop Songs","As a long-time Manilow fan, this is not my favorite Manilow CD. But, it is exactly what the title says - ""Manilow Sings Sinatra"", not ""Manilow Tries To Imitate Sinatra"". It is Manilow singing ""straight renditions"" of these songs, as Manilow would do them. And, while his voice is not what it used to be in his ""Mandy"" days, it is still OK. Acceptance of ""tribute-type"" efforts can difficult, especially by the most devoted fans of the honoree, but I don't think Sinatra or Manilow fans will be offended by this effort."
4,"The Original is Better, but He's Gone","At first hearing, one has to resist the obvious temptation to compare Barry to Frank. Although Sinatra will live on his many recordings, I hope other talented singers carry on the unique Sinatra style of music, adding in their own brand of originality. In the CD notes, Barry says he tried to stay true to his style without seeming to copy or imitate. For the most part, it seems he did just that, but I liked it nonetheless."
1,Guidecraft San Diego Padres Clothes Tree,This item was purchased for my seven year-old grandson with the purpose of encouraging him to hang up his clothes daily. Unfortunately the clothes rack fell over almost immediately after assembly and was broken rendering it unusable. I don't know what the problem was but suspect that the top team emblem is too heavy for the slender rack to support. A cute idea that did not work!MargaretFan of the San Diego Padres
4,No subtitle control,"On this edition of the DVD, there is no subtitle control; you cannot turn off the English subtitles.To my view, the film begins a little slowly. The viewer gradually finds the film more involving, as our accountant, William, becoms more and more interested in his new client, Anna. As a point of reference, I do not find the film quite as good as L'homme du train (The Man on the Train) and La fille sur le pont (The Girl on the Bridge), but it is almost as appealing."
3,Too much fragrance for my kids,"I wish these had worked for us. They are very convenient and they are labeled as sensitive but they still have fragrance in them. Unfortunately, my kids must be very sensitive as they get all itchy in their sensitive places when they use them. I wish I could find something that they could use. They are still too little for regular toilet paper."
4,"Great wipes, packaging not convenient","These wipes are great. My two-year-old just learned to use the potty and he does a pretty good job with these wipes. The only complaint I have is that the number of wipes per package is very limited, so I end up having to refill it all the time."
5,Enjoyable Historical Novel,"A friend recommended this novel when I commented that I would like to know more about why the Scots moved to Ireland. This is a book about division and adversity, and how some people dealt with it.The description of the Irish wake is something that I will long remember with emotions of sadness as well as joy.If you are interested in Irish history, I believe that you will enjoy this great book."
1,very disappointing,"This is the first Mamas & Papas album I have purchased. At first listening, I thought the sound was just a little bit off...and then I read the booklet and found out that this was the reformed group not the original 60's. Very disappointing."
2,I went to Cascade,"So I went to Cascade, the boarding school in northern California, in Whitmore. I have to say that he comes from the perspective of a bitter beginning schooler. I hated it to, don't get me wrong, I found it too restrictive, hated the fact that the rules were called ""agreements"", hated the ""contracts"", hated the forums (what he called raps...they changed the name to forums). I have gotten ripped to shreds in forums, had indictments turned on me, been on upperschool down bans once when I was in leadership so I could ""step out of my square"", had dishes and work projects, etc. etc. but I did get a lot out of that place and made friends that I still keep in touch with, so although everything he said in there was true, there is more to it than that, there was a lot to learn from that school."
1,Not as witty as Wurtzel; couldn't keep my attention,"I read the first twenty pages, which were interesting, then the focus of this book and its tone began to get repetitive and I could not keep my interest in it. I skimmed the rest.I find the pace of this memoir to be quite similar to Prozac Nation by Elizabeth Wurtzel; Wilsey employs the same shifting of short narrative scenes and deadpan humor applied to less-than-ideal situations. But where her memoir has a sense of the individual trying for some overarching philosophy or schemata, and wanting to reach toward herself, as well as some funny and generally sympathetic character portrayals, his memoir is nothing but a relentless chaotic jumble of unpleasant events, it seems."
4,Bluesmen can outblues the Stones anyday,"I have to admit that if it had not been for the Dartford renegades, I might not have started listening to the blues. These days it's pretty hard to listen to Mick mimic bluesmen. This cd has some great Stones numbers done well: Luther Allison, Taj Mahal, Gatemouth Brown, Junior Wells, and Johnny Copeland all outblues the Stones. Yea the Stones can still play some of their material, but just as the Ramones learned to give Street Fighting Man the energy that you never realized it lacked, these master bluesman hand you cover versions that sound fresh and natural."
5,love this writer. more more please.,a strong heroine. wonderful writing. plot just sizzles. up all night. more please. typing this out on original kindle one. no caps.
4,Great read!,"This was my first book by Christine Kling and I was not disappointed. Seychelle is no sissy, well able to take care of herself. The author keeps you guessing and eager to read more. Will definitely look for more of her books to read."
4,Riveting,Intriguing plot. Enjoyed the setting. Interesting protagonist as a salvage boat captain. Would read more of this author's books. Will recommend.
2,Lack of Customer Support,"Manual does not work in some cases. Customer Support is email only, they respond with a same ""not working"" part of the manual. Due to a poor customer support I have returned the product.Cadpro Platinum Bundle"
1,Do not buy,I downloaded Cadpro based on the promise of an easy to use program. They have no tutorial the manual is basically a dictionary. There is no support and nothing showing you how to use it. They have no telephone number listed and they do not respond to emails......Worst on line experience to date. They do not issue refunds if product is downloaded!!!!!Liz
4,Many Points of Deception,"Unlike many other novels that require initial warm up chapters, Deception Point grabs readers' heart from page one and immediately sets the tone for fast pace and intense reading. 133 chapters that take you every different direction makes the plot and the ending impossible to predict until chapter 132. This novel contains several deception points, as far as I'm concerned, that I'm curious to find out which point of deception the author meant when he gave this title. It is fascinating the way the author deceives the characters and the readers."
4,"A very good book, worth reading","After reading Angels & Deamons and the Da Vinci Code, I was very wary about how good Deception Point would be. I must admit I was pleasantly surprised. A good, fast-paced book, I wouldn't say ""unputdownable"" but definitely enjoyable. My only negative comment (last but not least) reffers to the publication. The book is printed on very thin paper, and the ink rubs off on your fingers. After reading a few pages my hands were black, as if I had been reading a cheap newspaper. A publication of such low quality should never be sold by amazon.com..."
5,EXCELLENT! OUTSTANDING! FANTASTIC!,"One of the best thrillers ever. The vocal performance was absolutely perfect. The story is addictive, don't be surprised if you find yourself arriving at a destination and not wanting to exit your vehicle until a chapter ends..."
1,Could not finish,I am an avid reader and generally not too picky. This was the first book in years that I gave away without having finished it. I started and put it down several times. After about 6 months I had only read about half of it and was dreading the need to finish. I came to realize that I just did not like the book. The plot was too unbelievable and I did not care much for the characters. I have read other books by the author and could not put them down. This one just missed the mark in my opinion.
3,NASA and the Arctic...what more can we ask of a action/suspense novel?,"Clearly written and fast-paced but more like a flavored icechip than an iceberg. Everyone likes flavored icechips, so I think most people will enjoy the book."
2,Its to twisted!,"Like others already wrote, i enjoyed the beginning of the book. I have read ""the Swarm"" and this reminded me a little of that great book. I got excited cause I thought this will be great. Unfortunately it cannot compete with ""the Swarm"" in any way because things just get too crazy, there are too many twists.Everything is just confusing. I didnt enjoy this book as much as i have enjoyed Angels and Demon.If you really want a phantastic read with lots of knowledge and a great plot then read ""The Swarm"" by Frank Schaetzing. Its an amazing book."
1,Unforseen problem,Though I had written a good review regarding delivery of the mentioned book upon reading same I found about 6 or 8 pages that had printing defects that made it impossible to read a praragraph or two on each of these pages. I consider that a book in those conditions should not even be offered for sale as it is defective. If I remember correctly it was offered as used as new.I thank you for the opportunity to record my opinion.SincerelyRicardo Cleaver
1,Terrible - riddled with technical flaws,"Dan seems to have forgetton that Ellesmere Island is part of the Country called Canada. So his highly improbable characters romp over Canada's sovereignty with the clear implication that the US owns the world. And I'm not a Canadian! Boy those Mounties up there must be dumb to not notice a huge American operation taking place in their backyard.He stretches too far in his attempt to characterize weapons, computer and communications technology about which it is obvious he knows very little.His scenarios of corruption and deceipt in high levels of government are so unrealistic they appear cartoon-like."
1,Deception Point by Dan Brown,"I have a serious complaint about this item. It was sold used in very good condition. The second to the last CD was over written with information from an entirely different book about the civil war. Therefore, a lot of critical information that comes at the end of a book was MISSING.Very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Dan Brown: Military Moron,"Dan Brown's research into military matters is laughable. In this book he describes a situation where an elite Special Ops squad is assigned the task to eliminate some Americans who have learned too much about a government cover-up.First, the Delta team would in fact never comply with such an order. Such an order would be unlawful and under the Uniform Code of Military Justice any soldier would be justified in refusing such an order.Second, assuming the team does attempt to kill these people, Mr. Brown gives them an unrealistic set of arms and equipment. They carry ""machine guns"", which are probably Heckler & Koch MP5s and should be refered to as ""machine pistols"" but they only have one clip of ammo and no side arms! In addition, they carry radios that are not ""hands free"" which would be ridiculous in a tactical situation."
1,Absolutely Awful,"This is one of the worst thrillers I've read in several years. Dan Brown does no research whatsoever in writing his books. It may sound like nitpicking, but he gets every scientific and technical aspect wrong. F-14s that fly at supersonic speeds from Washington to the North Pole and land on the ice. Powered skis that can go up hill and then recharge on the downhill (perpetual motion?). I won't give away the ending, but it's so implausible as to be laughable. Don't waste your time with this one. There are plenty of better authors out there that at least bother to do some fact-checking."
3,Good but not great.,"As with all of Brown's work this book contains a lot of information, it is very high paced, conspiracy theories, etc. As well as with other books from Brown this one's ending is kind of Hollywood movie style.This is a good book which will keep you interested to the very end."
3,"Good writing, ridiculous plot","I'm a fan of Dan Brown's, and the bottom line is that he is a very good thriller writer (except for some of the dialog, which can be *really* strained at times). However, while the plotting of some of his other books such as The Davinci Code is just on the right side of the line between believable and fantasy, Deception Point is simply ridiculous. It's one thing for conspiracy writer like Ludlum to posit dark shadowy meta-conspiracies with a very few people doing simple but far-reaching things. Deception Point, though, goes the other direction and has scads of people putatively involved in something that could never in a zillion years have been kept secret for more than three minutes. Frankly, I found the whole premise so unbelievable that I had trouble enjoying Brown's as-usual good pacing and decent characterization. So, my advice on this one is borrow a friend's copy to take to the beach, but don't shell out for the hardcover. Dan, you can do better!"
4,"A good read, but predictable.","After reading The Da Vinci Code I found Dan Brown to be an intelligent and note-worthy author. I enjoyed his fast pace and on-edge style of writing. After The Da Vinci Code, I read Angels & Demons which I thought was just as good if not better. Deception Point, being the third I've read of Dan Brown's novels has by far been my favorite of the three. This book was hard to put down, I wanted to keep reading more to see what unfolded next. Although, I pretty much already had a good idea how the story would end about three quarters into the book. Dan Brown writes wonderful books, but I have found it quite simple to predict the endings of Deception Point, Angels & Demons, and The Da Vinci Code nearly half-way through the novels. I still rate this book 4 stars because it was a very exciting read, but I wish the author would make it a little more difficult for the reader to unfold the conspiracy before the main characters."
2,Typical Dan Brown book,"I first read Angels and Demons. I could not have loved a book more! Then I read Digital Fortress and I wanted to start working for the NSA. After that I read Da Vinci Code. It was quite a good book. But lots of things were kind of predictable. I would still give it 4 stars. Then I bought Deception point. I read through it. I found it to be too predictable and too Dan ""Browny"". All the typical stuff. Last minute saves, things fall into place for the hero and the heroine. Same old stuff. I still give it 2 stars out of respect to Dan Brown for doing an excellent job on the other three. If you are a Dan Brown fan, i recommend you start reading the book without any expectations.I tend to believe that if this is your first Dan Brown book, you will enjoy the ride."
5,Very enjoyable,excellent read hard to put down. Very different from his more well know books of angels and demons and his other works
4,A Good One!,"After reading the DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons, which I found very good, I had to read Dan Brown's two other offerings. Deception Point was well written with a great deal of action and suspense. I am still wondering, though, how Dan was going to land the plane at Bolling Air Force Base. Bolling has no runway. A minor error in what was a fun book to read."
2,Let's just say I'm glad I got it for 50 cents,"I would write a detailed review on why I didn't like this book, but it's not worth it to waste more time on a book that took so much of it from me already.Suffice to say, the plot is boring and the overriding theme of NASA possibly being shut down due to the action or inaction of certain characters is duller than a roll of toilet paper. I highly doubt the possible privatization of NASA (or keeping it a government agency) is enough to keep most readers interested, and that is the focal point of the novel.The characters are dull. Not so much characters as caricatures.The only reason I made it though this book is because, like other Brown novels, it is so easy to read. Even though it's boring and contrived, you can easily make it through 50 pages a night and be done with it in a week. Of course, you could just skip it altogether and save yourself the anguish and frustration."
2,"great plot, disappointing end","I've read the other blockbusters by Dan Brown (DaVinci Code, Angels and Demons, Digital Fortress) and as with the others, I thought that DP started out great with a fascinating, page-turning plot. Unfortunately, once again the drama turns to juvenile schlock by the end. Having said that I do believe he'll write something one day that this reader will enjoy all the way through."
1,Blank Pages!,"I just shelled out 10 bucks for this piece of publishing garbage! Now I like Dan Brown's books and wouldn't normally knock them, but the brand new copy of Deception Point I bought is full of dozens of blank pages and at least a dozen half printed pages (the other half is grey!) Kind of hard to read a story when huge chunks of it are missing. If you intend to buy this book, I suggest you check every page for missing parts. I've read thousands of paper backs in my life time but I've never encountered such a publishing mess as this Simon and Shuster book!"
2,Reads like a first or second draft,"The concept of the book would work fine, if a few more editorial passes had been done. There are many instances of stilted writing structure and other basic writing mistakes. The book was something of an ordeal to read, it didn't have the smooth reading flow that Dan Brown's other books have. Perhaps it was rushed to the printer's to capitalize on the author's fame?"
5,Excellent book,This book caught me off guard just like Da Vinci code. I was very happy with the ending and it never got boring.
4,A Scientific Mystery laced with Lies and Murder,"Dan Brown's talent lies in his ability to craft plots so true to the worlds of science and politics. The adventure in Deception Point is so realistic that it leaves the reader's heart pounding. Although there are seemingly few suspects, the result is a jaw-dropping one."
3,Okay but Expected More from Dan Brown,"I loved both The Da Vinci Code and Digital Fortress. This book was a little too predictable for me. The advanced science jargon used to describe the meteorite and sea, etc made it to where I was looking up every other word on my Kindle. I think this book would be perfect for someone that has a science background though."
2,I don't understand how anyone could give this 5 stars...,"I'm not going to say this was the worst book I ever read... but how anyone could give it 5 stars is beyond me. There was some suspense and some action scenes but the lack of believability is so distracting that its hard to be impacted by this book in any way. To get 5 stars a book should have to impact you somehow, or change your perspective on something or give you the chills once in a while. This book is far to shallow to do anything like that. Its not fair to compare it to Da Vinci Code, but just be aware, just becuase you liked Da Vinci Code doesn't mean you'll like this one."
5,A Real page turner,"Reading first several pages will tell you what the deception is in reality, but until last several pages you'll be in continued animated status about who the controller is. The truth is so shocking that building of deception on deception will give you stronger shock. Due to Dan Brown's rich scientific tricks, you'll be totally taken in his deception dome!"
4,Deception Point,Good Book but will never exceed the popularity of Angels & Demons or The Da Vinci code... a bit predictable... but well written...
2,Just Kidding Right?,"What nonsense! Could not possibly be more far fetched. This book had a great premise and is very easy to read but falls apart very quickly. Under water volcanos? They exist I guess, but come on with this ending! There is also a large mistake at the end that is rather easy to pick up on. I will not give the ending away (which, unfortunatly, seems to be a growing trend in these reviews) but some of you will figure it out.Move on to more worthy books."
3,An Entertaining Story,"Deception Point centers around a NASA discovery of a meteorite, buried deep in the ice, inside the Arctic Circle. The discovery seems to indicate, life may exist outside our planet.I thought this book was an exciting read, for the most part. The story starts off slowly as the scene is set,and we are introduced to the main characters, but after about the 150 pages the action really starts, both in Wasington and the frozen north. Why only 3 stars? Well, two things, really. Firstly, I felt the character development was not great, and secondly, the 'good guys' seemed to have an awful lot of luck on their side, when in tricky situations."
2,"Formulaic, and contrived...","...embarrasingly predictable, with dialogue on par with the average UPN sitcom. Alternately pandering and pedantic, it reads like a extravagantly overwrought screenplay treatment, complete with product placements and obligatory Big Explosion at the end."
5,Exciting thriller,"Very exciting book, mostly read it because it was dan brown and I was interested to see what kind of book this was considering it wasn't related to religion like his other more famous books. Like his other books if you take it very seriously you'll probably have some problems with it, but if your simply looking for a science related thriller then this book is it."
3,Good story amongst the filler,"This was an excellent book marred by chapters full of what I would call ""filler"". The plot of the book is moving right along, when everything comes to a sudden halt with an entire chapter full of background info on one of the character or interrupted with seemingly useless interaction among other characters in the book. As an example, the main character can be at death's door on an iceberg when the story line suddenly switches to what politician had sex with which assistant on who's desk in Washington D.C. I found myself skimming page after page to get back to the ""action"". Again, this was a very good book with a great plot, but it should have been about one-third shorter."
2,Appalling Science,"When I started this book I had high hopes, but it didn't take long to be disillusioned. Although it was a good read, it makes a mockery of how science is practiced. The plot hinges on whether an object is genuine. However, none of the outside ""experts"" called in to examine it had the knowledge required determine its authenticity. The implication that these experts could somehow validate an ""astonishingly rare object"" found in an Arctic ice sheet in a short time is just unthinkable, especially given that they include a TV science popularizer and lack scientists with the necessary expertise. Routine geochemical analyses and additional tests would have revealed problems from the start. I won't go into how dreadful the explanations of how the object was formed were, suffice it to say that they were gross misrepresentations of what is physically possible. Usually, I can forgive a bit of stretching of the science in a book, but here things were stretched until they broke."
4,Best Dan Brown book yet...,"Deception Point is fast-paced, and hard to put down. Plot twists are surprising. Characters are well defined, as far as they go. This story would have gotten a five star rating but for its contradiciton of keeping NASA under government control. 'Government science' is a contradiction in terms. Force and Mind are opposites. Still, this was a great read. Worth your time."
4,A plausible Dan Brown novel,"My only argument with many of Brown's novels is that they sometimes strain credibility. I can deal with conspiracy theory if it is even remotely plausible, but jumping out of helicopters and surviving, evil killers with almost superhuman abilities, etc. detract from my enjoyment. This novel, on the other hand, is entirely plausible and equally entertaining."
1,Predictable like a bad made for TV movie.,"You are smarter than this, you really are. You'll figure out plot points many pages before they happen, sometimes even chapters before they happen. Oh, you'll hope the author of The DaVinci Code might have an ingenious twist or two up his sleeve in this earlier effort, but he does not. At least not one that isn't painfully obvious. And the ending... so... bad... ughhhh... it hurts... oh, dear God... it hurts... so much... please, make it... stop...If you are discerning in the least, take your memories of The DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons and your money and walk away, just walk away, and no one will get hurt.Then again, if you are looking for a literary lobotomy Deception Point may just be the ticket."
2,The boring of Dan Brown,"This book was the most boring of Brown's legacy. Forgettable characters, ill-written plot. Could skip this one if you may."
3,A good summer read.,"Although I have not read Dan's more accepted books, I did enjoy reading Deception point. The story kept my interest and I found the last hundred pages full of action and unexpected turns."
3,A page turner... but off on technical details,"On one hand I enjoyed this book and read through it in a very short time. On the other hand...The author and the book want to present themselves as technologically advanced and accurate. I know quite a bit about flying / aviation and therefore I was surprised at the gross errors I read whenever helicopters / aircraft / weapon systems were mentioned (I could cite a whole bunch of examples but that's not the point). Kind of makes you wonder if the guy has ever seen the inside of a jet fighter or knows the *basics* of helicopter flight. And if these references are full of mistakes, it makes you think that the rest of the story is just as poorly researched / founded.Kinda disappointing really."
4,A good college break read,"After spending the fall semester reading textbook after textbook, I was ready to read something for fun. This book kept me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't put it down and finished it in 4 days.Brown's book is meant to be realistic but not ENTIRELY realistic. Thats why its called fiction. If a book can take you to another place and help you forget the real world for just one moment in time....its a good read. And thats exactly what this book did. From the moment I picked it up I was enthralled by its plot, characters, and the danger.I would recommend this book to anyone."
2,Disapointing Read,"I loved Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code, so I thought I'd try one of Brown's earlier works. I was sorely disapoointed, as you can tell from my title. It lacked the flash and panache of his works already mentioned. Too much invention, rifles that fire ice and sand bullets, ships capable of near impossible speeds, and of course ""black"" helicopters firing missles at the FDR Memorial? Uh uh, I didn't buy it, but I did finish it, mostly because it was a fast read, and I didn't feel like I was devoting too much time to a mediocre book. Not that they can all be great, maybe I should have started at the beginning and worked my up, might have been pleasently surprised."
2,How could they all have been duped?,"Dan Brown's books are fast paced stories, but like Digital Fortress, Deception Point involves brilliant described who don't act brilliant. How can so many preeminent scientists be duped so easily. Also the Kiowa Warrior which destroyed the car and attacked the boat simply does not have the capabilities described. And even Delta Force couldn't fire a helfire missile in Washington DC without being tracked and shot down. As a helicopter pilot it annoys me when authors get the details so wrong."
1,Not up to Dan Brown's standards,This book was just like his first book Digital Fortress. As I was reading the characters were almost the same. He also did not do his research on the military men the things he had them doing had me laughing throughout. I guess if your audience is not military this book is ok. I thought it was demoralizing to say that these elite fighters would kill americans like they were robots or something. I would not waste my money on this book get it from the library for a good laugh.
1,Disappointing!,Absolutely not typical of Dan Brown's work! This was a total waste of Dan Brown's great talents as a writer!!!
4,Great Book,"I have read all of Dan Brown's book, and this is up there. It's very ""Dan Brown"" as his stories go with great research (though people will claim differently) and description and he always seems to touch on very important subjects. In this case it's about Nasa and Space research.It also is very good with the supsense and thrills, and it seemed to be to a lot more action oriented which was really entertaining.The only thing i have to say about this, is that there really is no SUPER great twist at the end like i've come to see from hsi other books. You kind of already know what's going to happen by the middle of the book, and there is one tiwst that's not all that big, and a pertty funny one at the end, but that's about it.Still enjoyed it alot though."
3,"Solid read, but not great","A entertaining, well written, solid read. Its fun while it lasts, then its forgettable. A good book worth the time and money."
3,Good thriller but stereotypical,"I will start this out by saying that I am a liberal, but I was still taken aback by how strongly negative this book was toward conservatives. Even Darth Vader is a more likeable and compassionate character than Brown's Senator Sedgewick. By making Sedgewick so evil, Brown managed by comparison to make murderous [...] into good guys.I also found it disappointing to see Brown rely on typical gender stereotypes. The heroine of the story is frail and needs her male sidekick to save the day. Sedgewick's assistant is likewise easily manipulated and frankly too weak to be believable in her role.All that aside... I still thought the book was a fun read. Dan Brown does a phenomenal job at grabbing the reader's interest and holding onto it tightly. His books are thought-provoking, exciting and more intellectual than most other fictions on the market."
2,A bad album,Guys this is not classic Motorhead. Well they play in their usual style but the result is not only not good -> is bad. the re is no comparison to their older albums.
3,a little disappointed,"The other reviewers talk about the power of this recording; to be honest, I was a bit disappointed on that front. This is probably reflective of the age of the original production (and use of 40s/50s recording equipment), but it really didn't blow me away. I was expecting thunder and lightning, and it's more like thick fog--highs are muted, lows are too heavy. It definitely has its moments, but I think I'll look for newer recordings when I want to get blown out of my chair."
4,this figure was awesome,"I didn't buy this toy to play with it, I'm just a collector, and I bought it because it is the best venom that I've seen, all the other vemons are either inaccurate or they look to bulky, this one is just perfect, it is actually the second one I bought, the first one was for my nephew, and he broke his leg, but that's because he doesn't take care of his things, I wouln't say its not durable,if you are a collector, or if you just love spider-man, and the characters associated with him, this action figure is perfect for you."
5,VERY INFORMATIVE!!!!,"I am a first degree black belt in MODERN Taekwondo. I read some of the above comments, please don't forget that Modern Taekwondo is constantly being updated to provide students with the newest techniques offered by the World Taekwondo Federation. Modern Taekwondo should not be confused with Traditional Taekwondo. Modern Taekwondo is constantly being updated. Traditional Taekwondo uses the same technique as they did before the Korean war. There is nothing wrong with Traditional Taekwondo, but it is years behind Modern Taekwondo. I feel this is an excellent book. It shows the proper forms from the beginner level to the master level. The forms are correct and precise. I highly recommend this book for anyone interest in Taekwondo (Modern Taekwondo or Traditional Taekwondo)."
2,"Good Story and Plot, BUT,......","Wish it had been better. The book seemed to lack detail and had a certain, I dont know, ""fakeness"" to it. Of course it is Science Fiction, but I just couldn't find the characters believable. I think the author should have devoted a few more pages on character development and back story. I thought the beginning went too fast and could have provided more depth to the fanaticism of the Skyborn and their mysterious past. An okay read, but I found myself struggling to finish instead of anticipating the next read. Hopefully, the sequel will be better."
2,Not worth the money,"I am new to the running world and read the other reviews on this product. I decided to purchase it from REI. I am so glad that I did so that I could return it and get something better. The top is really difficult to unsrew which makes re-filling on a long run awkward. Also, the rubber pop-top leaks and is very hard to close. This is awkward to drink from while running."
2,very small and questionable quality,"i discovered there are different sizes of hammocks. i have a large stand and this is a tiny hammock.the colors were pretty. the material was fine. felt like cotton, but it was a mix.the wooden stretcher was left unstained and unprotected so i imagine it would get a little rough with time.the stitching was unacceptable. looked like the sewing machine malfunctioned, but the factory worker (hopefully, an adult), just kept on sewing. the seams were jagged and ugly. i think mine was a fluke since no one else has complained about this issue.i returned mine for a larger hammock in a different brand."
3,Aruba Hybrid Hammock,"It's a small hammock, but very pretty. The wood rots and turns ugly fast. It may be a good idea to protect the wood with some sort of wood finish after purchase."
5,Wow! This band is great!,"The everything boys put on the best live act I've ever seen, and this CD captures all of their energy, style, and great music. This is a must buy for the rock and fan..."
4,Wow!,My psychiatrist recommended that I get the light and use it every morning. I did not have much hope that it would help but I notice a difference on the days that I do not use it.
4,Happy Light plus Vitamin D for best results for SAD,"The light is great, but if you really suffer from sad the absence of sunlight also means less Vitamin D. Vitamin and Full Spectrum Light together get best results for SAD."
5,Excellent Product,"I received my Happy Light about two weeks ago. The first two days I couldn't tell for sure if it was helping my mood and energy levels. Now, there is absolutely no doubt that the Happy Light is working very well to lift my mood and my energy levels. It feels a lot like drinking a cup of coffee in the morning - I use it for one hour each morning and it leaves me energized and less moody. Plus, this feeling seems to carry right through the entire day. What a wonderful product! I'm so glad I tried it after years of wondering if such lights really work."
2,sunshine,During dark and dreary days provides relacement sushineNo miracle cure for depression however its perfect forreading if you have vision loss as I haveAmazon had the best price that I could find
4,Product ok,"Does the job, but the way it stands is unstable, seems too small for the size of the product. Would have liked something a little more stable."
3,Happy Lite,Was recommended by a doctor friend...I use it every day...not sure if it works but I'm not sad...I guess time will tell
5,Well Made Good Protection,This is very well made leather case built to protect slipper slim point and shoot camera. I still have it and use it with my point and shoot inside.
4,Fatty,"It adds an extra width to the camera that makes it loose its slim design, but it nice and really protects the camera, plus it has two SD pockets.-+"
3,Exilim Case Overpriced,"This case is nice. It is leather and black. However it is very simple, and should not cost 25 bucks. But whatever, I guess it is better to protect your 2-300 dollar camera than be cheap about buying an overpriced case. At least the case is not as bulky as most camera cases."
1,Dangerous Case,"I incorrectly thought this was a case that fit on the camera, not a case to put the camera in, on my belt. The camera is only carried in this case and is removed to take pictures. That would have been at least acceptable for use, but after the camera too easily fell out of it on the blacktop parking lot, I don't use it on my belt any more. The sides of the case are too shallow and elastic, and the cover is held by a clever magnetic catch that doesn't work too well. The camera endured only a very small nick, but I was lucky. Apparently there are no cases to fit on the camera; not even Casio makes one."
1,First time - Horrible Experience- Negative Star,"They billed my credit card, Nov 27 and according to their email estimate arrival of merchandise will be between Dec 1-5. It's already Dec 10 and my camera case is NOWHERE to be found. Poor service, will NEVER purchase again from this site!!!"
4,Good case.,"When I first got my EX-S500, it spent every minute of every day in my pocket, the screen got a little bit scratched up so I decided to search for a protective case. Throughout my search I saw numerous third-party cases and stuff, but I want something made for my camera. While the case makes it more difficult to carry the camera comfortably in your pocket, it looks good, and the magnet that keeps the case closed is pretty strong. It hasn't fallen out yet. I definitely reccomend this case for this camera and any other Exilim series.Additional Tip: For extra security, look for a small 6-8 inch lanyard that comes with CD players and attach it to the camera and then loop the lanyard around the beltloop of the case."
1,Casio EX-CASE1 Leather Case,"Ugly, bulky. It is completely different from the photo shown on the web."
1,Don't waist your money on this compilation.,"Don't get me wrong, I grew up on Motley Crue. And if you want some good Crue albums, pick up Too Fast For Love, Shout at the Devil, and Dr. Feelgood. Those are the three best Crue albums. This Greatest Hits album includes a few songs from their Generation Swine album which was the first album I ever through out in the trash. That is my reason for the one star rating."
5,Familiar format for seniors,"I purchased this book for my senior parents who have in the past year bought not one, but two new computers. Brave as they are, computer jargon is new to them, and sometimes I am hard pressed to help them out long distance. It was great to find this book that looks SO MUCH like the red Reader's Digest Do-It-Yourself book that has occupied my father's bookshelves for as long as I can remember. That familiarity is bound to feel something like climbing a new mountain in a pair of comfortable old jeans."
5,Worked fine.,"Have little to say, but this RAM worked fine with my Fujitsu-Siemens Amilo D 7820(fh2u)."
5,"Awesome, Crisp, Clear & low grain",Love the tones of this film. The low grain makes for large clear pictures with almost zero grain. The negatives are solid and easy to work with too.
4,Communications Policy and the Public Interest,I found this book to be an easy way to understand the policy and legislation passed by congress on the Telecommunications Act of 1996.This book helped to explain exactly what came out of this Act and where the act came from. It also gave a great understanding of where communications stands in America and what our main goals for the communications industry are.It was an excellent way to view what the gov't wants out of the communications industry and what the future holds for the consumer.Great Buy!
3,"Dated, but not without some good advice.",Written some years ago....when the concept of falling real estate prices was unknown. Some good thoughts on cash flow and costs.
4,Just what I hoped for.,"We purchased this set for our 3 year old's birthday. They go perfectly in her dollhouse, which is not a modern design. The set is colorful and bright and she thoroughly enjoys playing with it."
2,Getting Very Politically Left,I've been a long time subscriber. AJN is currently a left leaning nursing magazine. I find it insulting. Articles about current medical trends and what nurses need to know about these trends have improved. Nursing 2007 was always a better publication for that. And everyone should be receiving the free publications Nursing Spectrum and Advance for Nursing that will give you lots of current nursing news.AJN has gone 'round the bend on it's politics push. I will not be re-subscribing. There is a reason it is no longer the publication of the American Nurses Society. I'm not sure what that reason is as they are very left wing as well.Go to the library if you have to read AJN articles.
5,Great CD to showcase Neko's voice,This CD is of a live performance in Texas. The small band accompanyment makes it feel like you're listening to Neko and Kelly Hogan in a coffee shop. Trust me - this is a good thing! There is also 1 song that you will not find on any other album:Behind the House - this song is incredible!The repeats are unique in sound and have an intimacy to them which begs for repeated listening. You will be glad you bought this CD. I'd also recommend the live DVD performace as well!
5,Extremely Satisfied,"I ordered this for my 6 year old grandson and he loved it! He played with it all week after Christmas, along with all the other Lego City toys he received."
2,I need therapy after reading this book,"This is the first book that I have read by author, Elizabeth George. I don't know if it would have been more enjoyable to me if I had read some of her other books, but I doubt it. It was just one bad thing after another happening to the three children in the book. I would cringe every time Joel would leave the house, afraid he would be beaten. Anytime there was a ray of hope that any of the children would rise above their circumstances, something horrible would happen and they would be even worse off than before. When I finally finished the book, I felt sickened.I suppose the book did offer a look at how kids enter a gang lifestyle and get stuck in it. I need to read a happy book now."
1,Drab and dull,"Overly didactic and utterly pedantic, I didn't even finish Ms. George's latest book, ""What came before he shot her"". I am not interested in her viewpoints on social ills, I am interested in a good story. Alas, this does not a good story make! It is boring. It is dry. Besides, handwringing and making excuses for the evils that people commit based on a perception that social ills bring about behaviors that would not occur otherwise, is ignorant in the extreme and just another version of utopian thinking. Unfortunately, this is the malarkey that Ms. George feeds us with this novel. Again, I don't read a book to be lectured and that is really all this book is, a lecture disguised as a novel.As a fan of her Lynley/Havers characters, I will read the next book because her past work with those characters has been superb, and for that reason, I give her a pass on this dull endeavor."
2,background would have helped,"The book was a slightly difficult read due to the frequent use of lower class British vernacular in dialogue. If you can get past that, you will find a long and occasionally interesting story with several digressions and slow exposition. It finishes with several loose ends, though after looking at other reviews here I know that if you've read one of her other books things do make some more sense. I picked this up at random to read on a long flight. I am not inclined to read anything else by the same author."
1,Horrid book from my favorite author,"First let me say that I read five books a week and Ellizabeth George is my favorite author. I have been anxiously awaiting her new novel. Instead of taking the time to write a detailed review on this very forgettable book, let me just echo the rest of the reviewers...DO NOT BUY IT.I rarely put a book down without finishing.. I could not get through the first 100 pages. I did not like the characters, did not care what happened to them and did not want to read about them."
1,Disapointed,After 505 pages before Lyndley was even mentioned out of 548. What a terrible waste of paper. I read mysteries for the joy of it.
1,Bypass this one,"In three words: ""Don't BUY IT"" or ""DON'T READ IT.""The topic could have been a slice of insight included in a regular novel about Lynley and Havers. We wait for these books and read them for ENTERTAINMENT and to follow our favorite characters. This is the world of a NOVEL This is what we read to escape after we are done with the work-a-day items that some of us have to deal with from 8-4 Monday through Friday. I feel that what was just put before us in the shape of ""What Came Before He Shot Her"" were her working notes--background that the author needed to set up a real Lynley/Havers yarn. In her defense, I do appreciate the effort to enlighten the readers about the plight of the minorities in England. (Not every character in an English mystery needs to look or sound like they fell from the pages of ""Jane Eyre"") I hope that Elizabeth George redeems herself when she publishes again."
4,New Reader of Elizabeth George,"I got this book based on a review, not having been a previous reader of Ms. George's work. I actually listened to a recording in my car. It got so I couldn't wait to be driving just to listen to what would come next with these extremely well written characters. I so wanted each of them to achieve happiness. Yes, it is bleak. And, yes, I can't stop thinking about it and about those who end up caught in a life that they never deserved. It did make me want to go out immediately and get more books by Ms. George. Based on some of the other reviews, however, I hesitate. If this is not representative of her other work, and her other work is all happy endings and fluff - well - that is not what I enjoy reading. I do read to escape, but not to completely tune out of real life."
1,So Dissappointing,Could Elizabeth George possibly address any issues more depressing and with no possible solutions. It seems like she had to cram every horrible social problem known to man in this book and inflict it on one family. This book was so depressing and dull and I am very wary of what George will produce next.
1,"The Clue, folks, is in the title","The title of this ""mystery"" bothered me from the get-go. Is Ms. George going to present a sociological treatise? Yes, after 100 pages I decided to skim the rest of the book and could see it heading where I assumed it would be heading from the beginning - revving up all the situations everyone has read about the plight of poverty and racisim in Britain [as well as elsewhere]. A mystery? - well, here's the problem and deception. It really should not be placed in this category. As a mystery I give it 1 star; as a sociological tract I give it 3 - not much insight is offered in the pages; we are given ""What Happened Before..."" but that could have been done in a 10 page summary. I agree with those who were overwhelmed with the unrelenting tedium of bleakness presented in the book. Books exposing the horrors of poverty and racisim abound in the libraries of the world, we don't need another that just ""dramatizes"" the same."
1,Unfortunate 722 pages,"I am an Elizabeth George fan but this was something else. I did persevere thinking that it might redeem itself at some point but was totally disappointed. The characters were flat and underdeveloped. The plot was a sad statement of aspects of life that however true or untrue were presented in a fashion that lacked interest. What was claimed to be a mystery was no mystery at all and even though pronounced as ""profoundly moving"" was neither profound nor moving. Sorry Ms. George, I will look forward to your next book."
4,It's not that bad!,"I'm also a big fan of Elizabeth George. This book is not that bad! Yes, it's depressing, but Ms. George's novels aren't exactly light hearted. It takes you to the darker side of life, which isn't that different from the majority of authors out there now. Jodi Picoult doesn't exactly lighten up my day, for example. This book is well written, pulled together nicely, and is very realistic. You are pulled into these characters, you root for them, you want to help them. I knew what was going to happen but I still kept hoping for a way out. If you are a fan of Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers, you will want to read this book."
1,Lynley/Havers Fans - Don't waste your money on this one,"I should have read the customer reviews before buying this book!!! This is NOT the Lynly/Havers/etal detective, crime solving novel I was led to believe I was buying by the publisher's review. Now I do admit that I did not read all the way through that lengthly tome. I was so bored after the first chapter that I had to really force myself to continue. I was finally reduced to skimming through the book to see when my favorite Scotland Yard detective would finally show up - well that didn't happen until the last page. Will not further waste my time with this book. Elizabeth George should be ashamed. This is probably the last of her books I will buy."
1,No credibility,"I would not read another book by Elizabeth George. This one is about 200 pages too long, with a lot of gratuitous sex, ending with a finale that lacks credibility. The job would have been entrusted to someone more capable and trustworthy. While the leadup 500 pages had some insight into how difficult it is for such a family to cope with the gangster element, it was not worth the time to read it. (I had to because of a book club, but will pan it there too.)"
1,Skip this Elizabeth George Novel,"I'm a big Elizabeth George fan and would give five stars to her previous effort, With No one as Witness. However this one is nothing more than a fictionalized sociological study of the London underclass. George is usually great with charactar and dialog but the voices often ring false here, especially when the main character, a 12 year-old boy, is on stage. There is not much of a plot, really. Fans who've read With No One as Witness will understand how this book is going to end from the title. It takes a long,loooong time to get there."
3,I expected her to sound like Whitney.,"Maybe it was unfair to expect so much, but Cissy fell short of my high expectations. She's an OK gospel singer but no Mahalia, that's for sure. I wanted to like her more than I did."
3,Monster Power,"Not exactly what I thought it was, but will put to use somehow. This one needs to be hard wired to your car. It does NOT use the cigarette lighter to pull DC power..."
3,eh... it's ok,"It is nice looking and very quiet, unfortunately not as powerful as I had hoped. In a room 20'x20', it hardly makes a dent unless you are standing right in front of it."
1,"Large, noisy",The item is large and does not look good. Its first speed is way too powerful and too noisy.
4,Very fun,"The base for the launcher pad is a little flimsy, but it is easy enough to put back together when it comes apart. Other than that, the toy is great. I debated whether or not to buy this set or the junior set for my three year old son, and am happy with my purchase. My son is able to get the rockets pretty high, and loves to watch me send them flying over the roof of our house."
5,Super fun,My daughter has had this now for a couple years. We have purchased replacement rockets over time. Otherwise a fun toy for outdoors!
4,Cool Toy,Boys and their mom are having good times with this thing. Action/reaction just fascinates the hell out of them.
