1,Confuddled!,"This juice is just eat-up with stank! Where are the flowers?! It smells like a huge pile of baby powder that has been doused with hair spray! I just can't figure out why my nose will not detect any flowers. What's more, why is this perfume so dang popular?! Color me confused and befuddled. Kenzo makes some of my favorite perfumes by the way. His other florals like Kenzo de Kenzo (Ca sent Beau), Perfume D'ete, and Le Monde Est Beau are just gorgeous. Based on those scents I was expecting the scent of actual flowers, not synthetic ones floating in a talcum stew. I'm just surprised that no one else finds this chemical and aldehydic."
1,DON'T DO IT,"Unfortunately I didn't read the fine print and didn't realize that I would be unable to return this product. I have been wearing Flowers By Kenzo for the last six years and this doesn't smell like it at all...this smells like alcohol...and some other funky mess. I figured that since I love Amazon and had total trust in them, that I would get the authentic purfume...WRONG!!! And I am stuck with it!Well lesson learned...read the fine print and don't order perfume from Amazon."
2,Be cautious,I bought this phone in late july and 2 weeks later the batery died while I was using it I put in the charger and the phone would not charge or stop beeping I finally threw it away because it was surely broken.
3,A great phone but...,"This BLUE version is more costly than the red or green version - WHY I CANNOT TELL YOU! Still this is a great quality item, the image of what a cordless phone ""should be""... Highly recommended if you can handle the extra $10..."
3,Difficult to read,"This book is one of about 30 written by rape survivors that tell their own stories. I have tried to read this book twice now, and both times I've gotten so depressed halfway through that I've had to put it away. The 30 entries include poetry and personal essays, and though they are written with the idea of helping other victims, I find them too short to provide resolution. The result for me is a collection of 30 horror stories without much comfort. One contributor was raped eight times and other was raped five times -- I feel like I'd need to be tougher to finish this book. Yes, there were many things that I related to as a rape survivor; yes, the appendix has a lot of useful information that I haven't found elsewhere; and yes, it's one of the only times I've heard from male victims (two entries). However, overall, I recommend caution when approaching this collection."
5,"Great story, great book","Imagine you're a young Inuit teenager on a special mission from your tribe...find the witch who put a hex on your cousin and have her remove it. This is the reason Kiviok and Iksik set out across the Canadian tundra with two sled dogs as their only companions. Add to the story a sea monster, unscrupulous gold miners and a large forest denizen, and you've got the ingredients for an enchanting adventure story for young readers. There's enough tribal lore and excellent writing to satisfy older readers also."
5,Cute & handy!,Got this for walking my dog of course mainly because I didn't want to be carrying around the grocery bags. This little holder is cute and holds many bags tightly so it isn't very bulky. I recommend this to anyone that owns a dog!
2,"Not an effective dispenser, but bags are good","Having this clipped to the leash gets annoying quick, but the biggest downside is that there's not mechanism to help you tear the perforated bag from the roll. We do like the bags themselves"
5,Outstanding!,"I am so very glad this radio was available for me to order! I have several Sangean radios, and every one of them--let's see, I believe it is 5 different models BEFORE this one, 2 of one model and 3 of another, plus one each of 3--every one is aces!I'm sure there are some Sangeans that would not be a good fit for me, but so far I haven't bought one that wasn't. I read the specifications and the reviews very closely, and a lot of times! before deciding to order one.This radio, like the 5 different models I got before it, came well packed. The instructions are great. The features are excellent. It is well made, sounds just like I need for it to sound, has the functions I need, is a great size and shape--it's just great.I only got this today, got it working in just a few minutes, and I'm looking forward to having it for a long time. I walk, don't run, and will be very careful not to drop it. I have it in the case it comes in, and that fits fine in my pocket.A home run, Sangean!"
4,Digital AM/FM Tuner with Mono/Stereo Switch,"The crucial advantage of this unit is the ability to receive FM stereo signals in mono mode, which boosts the signal-to-noise ratio. In simple terms, this makes weak stations sound stronger. (Sony Walkmans no longer offer a mono switch). Otherwise, this digital radio tuner has functioned very well for me during my many long walks over the past couple of years. A minor downside of this unit is the fact that it is a little bulky, requiring 2 AAA batteries. Also, the ""ear-buds"" were worthless (and painful), but easily replaced by $9 Panasonic headphones. The station preset selection controls are complicated and non-intuitive, and the instruction manual is hard to understand. But this is a good tuner, and I do recommend it."
2,"Bad cuing, Not balanced.","The voice-over narration could be vastly improved. Several times during the workout, Janis switches sides, but doesn't cue to do so, and since you are not looking at the screen at the time, you don't know what's going on. At other times, she cues ""arms back"" when ""arms up"" is what she means, and ""bottom leg"" when she means ""top leg"".Moves opening the chest and back and leaning to each side to stretch the obliques are repeated three times during the workout. It seems like an aweful lot of oblique stretching, whereas the lower body (which needs more stretching in most people) is given short shrift."
2,too wobbly for my taste,I was excited to receive this piece so I could put my Crosley turntable on it. While putting it together I noticed there are no holes drilled in the back for the screws to secure the back panel. Two of the pieces look like they were dropped but it's hidden well so I can handle that. I don't like to send things back unless it's very noticeable. But after getting it all together it's very wobbly maybe bc the back panel cannot be secured.
4,"Nice, but cheaply made",I'll give it 4 stars. But I thought it was a little overpriced. Easy to put together. The finish doesnt quite match the crosley turntable I bought. Somewhat sturdy.
4,59 minute baseball practice,The video is pretty informative especially for a new coach as myself. but it is geared towards beginner players. If you are coaching older players with a few years of experience it can help you a little but not much. The drills are great for younger kids they are fun and difinate will help them develop. I wish he would come out with a video for older kids.
5,Coaching Ideas That Work!,"This item is terrific for youth baseball coaches who want to learn drills that they can incorporate in their practices. This has got it all. Fielding, hitting, base running, bunting and other stuff that will make a youth coaches experience positive. Had bought Coach Schupak's other video ""48 Championship Basketball Drills"" and the same concept is used. Keep all the players active doing numerous drills so players won't get bored.The concept seems to work well!"
5,Wai Lana Review,"I found Wai Lana's relaxation workout to be wonderful- I really enjoyed her gentle approach, and found her instruction very easy to follow. It certainly lives up to it's name."
3,IF YOU GIVE A MOOSE A MUFFIN,"I thought that this was a well written kids book, although it wasn't very creative. I gave this book a three star rating because it wasn't creative. I say that this book wasn't very creative because the author that wrote this book also wrote a book called IF YOU GIVE A MOUSE A COOKIE, coincidence, I think not."
3,"Mouse/Cookie one is better, but still cute","The ""If you Give a Mouse A Cookie..."" is better.. This book (Moose/Muffin) doesn't seem to flow as well. The pictures are cute, but my 3 yr old does not seem to care for this one as much (my husband and I agree!)."
5,Great book for kids,"My niece who is 3 can't get enough of this! She loves that moose. Very cute and also fun for adults, doesn't get tiresome like some do."
2,Not too good,"I just got three boxes on line. I like the pattern and the shape, but each box had different shades of the same color. Two of the boxes had broken pieces. I was sent replacements boxes after much irritation, and most of the replacements had patterns which where blurry! What a mess. I don't understand how Corelle can put out such an inconsistent pattern. Don't purchase these dishes unless you can see them all first."
4,Pleased with Corelle gift.,Purchased 2 sets a present. Recipient was very pleased. Product was in great shape when it arrived and seemed quite sturdy. Design was as pictured.
4,Corelle is fantastic!,"My favorite thing about Corelle dinnerware is that it is incredibly lightweight but extremely durable. Glossy, microwave-safe, and very well-made."
1,DON'T BUY THIS ITEM - LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS!,"Beleive me, I'm being generous giving them a whole star - if I could figuire out how to give them less than that I would! I should have listened to the other disatisfied customers. The video quality is terrible (no- it's not my Sony Wega 27"" TV). It just looked liked someone went to the local Marine Aquarium, paid their [$$$] entrance fee and set a tripod in front of the tank. The lighting is terrible, the music is [poor]. Do I sound upset? You bet I am! I wish I had been smart enough to rent a camcoder and call myself a movie maker! I am willing to venture all the other Aquaria volumes in this series are equally as [poor]. Why else would the price fall from close to [$$$] to under [$$$] in only about a year?My advice, save your money and just buy a real fishtank!"
4,"Excellent quality, beautiful clarity and colors, just two things ...","I love this 2-set DVD - it's really like having an aquarium. I'd recommend it to anyone. Just a couple of things: I can only select the bubble sound, the other options don't work. Nor was I able to access any additional features via computer DVD drive - and I tried it on two different of my computers (a VPR Matrix and a HP Pavillion.) But if you're not interested in the additional features and just want very lifelike, gorgeous colored, ample selection of aquariums to enjoy, you can't go wrong with this DVD collection."
1,Read This Before You Buy,"I have a plazma television which produces an excellent picture. Even from mediocre signals like regular t.v.. I was very excited to pop this DVD into my player and watch some dazzeling scenes but was very disappointed. The picture clarity leaves ALOT to be desired especially on the long shot of the full aquarium. With no less then 42"" of screen I could barely make out the fish in the tank! I know, your thinking at ($$$) how can you go wrong? I'd rather spend the money on a juicy burger and fries."
1,#1 WORST PURCHASE,"I cannot remember ever being more dissappointed after purchasing a product. The music stinks, the sound effects stink, and the aquarium looks like it was filled an hour before the taping. It is so cloudy it would make any aquarium enthusiast cringe. Save your money and take your camcorder to your local aquarium for better quality footage."
3,So so,"If you we're expecting world changing differences due to the price of this thing don't get your hopes up. I still get sore and if its cold out forget it, it turns into a board!"
2,It's boring,"The interface is confusing. The scenes are presented without any explanation, then since you don't know what is it that your are looking at, the whole sequence becomes boring. The sound is not very good, additionally, the close caption is practically inexistent."
5,naughty but really nice!!!!,"i don't like many musicals but this is a nice way to spend a saturday night when you don't expect to have a date.mcdonald and eddy are pleasing to listen to even if the plot is tried,somewhat tired BUT a joy to listen to,and how DOES she keep all her make-up on while going through a possible rape and death by pirates?ask louie b. mayer OR the MGM lion.the musical numbers are memorable and i kept singing along after the tenth viewing...but her dresses have far too many bowes but who cares?and how does she look so fresh after wearing the same dress on a sea voyage from france to the new world and two days on the run?don't fret just listen to the music!the last five minutes will have you in tears...""ahhh sweet mystery of love at last!"""
5,naughty marietta,Im a man aged 47 and I dont know any other person besides myself who loves this movie I wish I did. I also love maytime. I wish they had these movies on dvd
4,Don't buy with the remote control included,"This unit should come with a corded remote control attached. However many resellers don't have the remote and sell it without.You'll have a tough time controlling the unit without it. The buttons, especially the fast forward and reverse, are tough to handle and even worse the editing buttons are on the underside of the unit!I have one of these, without the remote, and learned the hard way that you really need it. NOw I'm scouring the net looking for a remplacement."
4,"With a back-lite LCD on the remote, It would be perfect!","This unit sounds great, is easy to operate and with an optional stereo microphone, makes fantastic recordings from live performances. The price ain't bad either."
5,awsome must buy item,if u travel alot and ur always listening to music then this is the way to go its compact and its cheap to purchase blank mds sony is the creator of minidisc so it is probably the best system u will find!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,So far Excellent,"I got this 3 days ago, so I can't say much. But when I got it, great condition, crisp clean stereo sound, I love to listen to video game music. This device seems perfect for stuff like that. The little remote is cool, easy to use, I've been too rough, maybe a light touch goes far. I dont know all of the features yet so I can't say more."
4,IMAGINE if ELASTICA was AMerican,"i have liked the rondelles ever since i have seen them open up for the tuscadero ladies in '98. i bought their first cd, fiction romance and fast machines. i was pleasantly surprised by how fun and great they are. however, i would feel dissapointed if the next cd was to sound just like their first one. and the good news is that it isnt. its songwriting is more mature, their playing is more solid and in-your-face, and juliet's voice sounds better. it is a great cd with lots of funny lyrics and rocking songs! go get it."
4,What a pleasant mistake!,"I bought this record thinking I had been lucky enough to aquire a rare pressing of Elton John's long OOP (Out-Of-Print) album ""The Fox"", which my wife and I recieved for a wedding present in 1981. Boy was I ever surprised! I'll bet these girls are so young they weren't even around to hear such classics as ""Just like Belgium"" and ""Heels of the wind"". At any rate, after having found the real EJ classic here at amazon I thought I'd give this one another spin and - guess what - I liked it. A solid beat the whole way through! Maybe one day they will release something on par with Elton's ""Rock of the Westies"". We can only hope..."
4,More chilling in HD,"The main thrust of this documentary - with an excellent, understated narration by William Shatner - is a chronological history of the US nuclear weapons tests from 1945. The impression one gets on viewing is one of reflection of the emotive, not just physical effects that weapons like these have.With a mixture of interviews, filmed recordings and occaisonal CGI, the impact of the decision to approve the tests and destructive force of the weapons is brought home.The HD transfer is superb, particularly the better preserved film footage. The colour pallete and contrast really shows the explosions in a truly terrifying light, making one thankful they were used only once in anger - a fact not ignored in the film.Unfortunately the audio has not been upgraded, being a straight 5.1 DD soundtrack with is adequate without being overly impressive.Recommended."
3,Great Movie....Unfortunate DVD Audio Glitch,"To be sure, this is a great movie....I give the movie five stars. Unfortunately, there is a glitch in the DVD audio that is rather amazing. I sure hope the quality control on nuclear weapons is better than the quality control on this DVD.Since I did not see a single comment posted on this glitch, I have to admit that it may not matter to most of you reading this, and I'm willing to bet that all of you who commented on the film were listening to the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack.For those of you who do not have a surround sound system and resort to listening to the Dolby Stereo 2.0 soundtrack, you will soon discover something amazing....the sound is ten seconds out-of-sync with the picture! How this error went unnoticed by the DVD production team is beyond me. Fortunately, the sound/picture synchronization on the 5.1 soundtrack is fine."
5,This is the best movie ever!!!!!!!!,This awesome video contains 5 HOT guys that happen to have the best voices in the world!! This video is a must have. You will wacth it over and over and over.
5,This video is a must see for any fan!,"Justin and JC are so hot in this video. It is like the lays potato chip, you can't just watch it once. Once you start watching the hour and a half just fly by."
5,This video is da BOMB!!,"'N SYNC fan or not this still is the video to buy, see their european videos and american. It also has some funny part where the guys do silly things. I love 'N SYNC, especially Justin. I have posters all over my wall. This video is a must get.love ya Justin!"
5,A Perfect Video for the New 'NSync Fan,"I am a fairly new 'NSync fan, so I needed to find more information on the guys. (Besides the fact that JC is way hot! ) This video not only lets you see what happens in their daily business lives, but also reveals a bit of each of their own personalities. It also proves that they are not the shallow boy band everyone makes them out to be. It shows that they were in fact not put together by a producer, but worked on their own to start a band. Another good part of the tape, is the music videos. (But that however is a personal preference.)"
5,BRAVO!!!!!,"This vidio was so cool. The Guys look so good in this vidio. A very good buy, you will love the interveiw stuff. If you do not have this vidio GET IT NOW!!!!! I mean, if you are an *NSYNC fan you must get it!!!!!!"
5,n sync in the mix best video ever,"N SYNC in the mix is the best video I have ever seen. This video is full of energy and full of 5 very fine guys. Getting to see my guy, JC, is a real treat. Thanks NSYNC for making this video. I love JC!!"
1,This was the most boring piece of film I have ever seen,"This video had no point and was not entertaining at all. My friend was watching this video and I got stuck watching it and I literally fell asleep. This did,although, give me a better idea of their music and shallow as it may seem, their looks. I listened to their music once or twice before and Thought it was good dance music but now that I really listened to it, I really think that their voices sound awful and none of the guys really are that great looking, especially the one with the blond curly hair, I don't know what he was thinking."
5,THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO--JUSTIN ROCKS!!,"Hey, I love *N SYNC and their video, it really brings out them and i thought that it was really funny@! I liked the part when they were singing ""500 miles"", where Chris rides the dog,&Chris sticks head out of window.This is great for a big fan! I think that everyone should have this video!If they already do-Good Job-if they don't -GET IT!! Thanx a lot! Emily:)"
2,"buy the regular versions, not the combo",The game is no where near as good as the 90's and 80's games by themselves. I own all three now and am just going to use the questions from the combo game to add questions to the other two games. There are a lot fewer questions and it seems like it is a travel type edition because they shortened the game tremendously.
5,Worked fabulously.,"I traveled to New Zealand just a couple of weeks ago, and I took two of these Samsonite adaptor plugs along with me. They worked very well with all of the electronic devices I carried with me, including my cell phone, laptop, and camera chargers. I'm very pleased with this product."
4,goes smaller size,"I ordered size 8M like all my other shoes, but these were too small, need to order 1size bigger, other than that good quality shoes, comfy heel"
2,poor quality photography & editing,"CSD is a constant series of 3 sec film clips with generally too much camera shake. The marine subjects are beautiful, but the filming and production are definitely 2nd rate. I'm glad I have an old VHS copy because I forgot how poor quality this is, and was considering buying the DVD. I only made it thru 12 mins of the video and hit the stop button. There are other much better coral reef titles out there."
4,Wonderful look under the sea,"This is a wonderful video showing life on a coral reef. The images are stunning yet not overwhelming. Some of the scenes tend to be short while others can be a bit long, but well edited. The soundtrack is nice but can be distracting at times. My true issue with this video is the incorrect naming of animals. Granted, this could be due to colloquial naming but calling a nudibranch a flatworm is incorrect--it's a mollusk. Overall I would recommend this video because it shows the wonderful biodiversity of coral reefs. A great addition to a video library."
4,Winter Shenanigans in Crozet,"It's a brutal January in Crozet and the citizens keep warm by cheeing on their favourite University basketball team until someone drops dead outside of the gym one cold night. Of course Harry and her animal pals never for once think it is natural causes, and sure enough another body turns up in one of the storage closets where the basketball games are played. This sets Harry and all her friends on the search of a murderer. And this murderer seems particularly cold-blooded. There's lots of fun and hijinks before they unmask the ""perp"". As usual, lots of good times between the pages of a Rita Mae Brown Mrs. Murphy mystery."
4,Very pleasant,"This was my first Rita Mae & Sneaky Pie mystery. I don't recommend starting with this one, because there are so many characters (both human and animal) and they take a while to keep sorted. Nevertheless once I really got into it, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Somehow a cozy mystery is very comfortable, and this book satisfied me thoroughly in that respect.Still, it does ask you to suspend belief in so many ways! Not just the talking animals, but the whole set-up of Crozet (this is my first to read, but it's obviously a murder capital). And there is the idiocy of the main character at the end of the book as she confronts the murderer - done in such a way that the animals can play a role. A cozy of this nature can never reach great literature, hence only four stars. But a very enjoyable four stars, and I will be reading more by these authors."
4,I like the variety,"While I usually subscribe to and drink the columbian coffee. It is nice to have some variety at times. My least favorite in this package is the Kenyan, it just doesn't seem very full-bodied. The rest are really nice. My preference is the Columbian. I order a six pack of Columbian every other month and a four pack of this variety every other month. This seems to work well for my husband and me. We find we can use two coffee pods for two cups. After we hit the double cup we wait for the machine to warm up a bit and add a push of the single cup. This makes the two pods last just a bit longer.When my mom comes over, she likes a really strong cup of coffee. I just make the coffee as per the factory specifications. She is a real coffee snob and yet she loves to come to my home for a cup of coffee : )"
3,Better Deals Elsewhere ...,Better Deals Elsewhere ...After ordering I found the same deal at Wal-Mart - and with .97 shipping far better. Amazon Shipping is terrible; unless you pay extra for the expedited shipping it sits in the warehouse for almost a week!Hay Amazon what about customer service!!!
3,Senseo Coffee Pod Assortment,"Great assortment with three of the four being excellent and one being just ok. don't remember which one the wife and I were not as impressed with but, they were all decent."
3,"Am I Missing Something??? Yes, the Taste of Coffee","We recently switched from a Keurig brewer to the MyCafe by BUNN and bought this variety pack of coffee as our start up stash. All three coffee drinkers in our house agree, these are very weak, pretty non-descript coffees. You would have to brew with about 4 ounces of water to get any real coffee flavor. I won't be re-ordering these, there is no comparison to the K-cup Sumatran or Columbian brews we used to get with our Keurig. I will continue to look for some pods that actually taste like coffee. The Keurig is no longer an option for us since we moved to an area with very hard water and couldn't keep the thing descaled enough to get a reliable cup of joe out of it. Love the MyCafe brewer,just wish there was a larger selection of good coffee. These pods didn't get the job done for us, but if you like weak coffee it might be just the brew for you."
5,Excelent coffee,These coffees are so good and can't be bought in any store. I bought it for my son and he just loves all the flavors.The price is right and with super saver delivery even better.
3,Senseo Coffee Pods,The Senseo brand of coffee pods produce a consistently mediocre tasting coffee. It would be great if Amazon could find a more robust flavor coffee pod brand; something more akin to the Starbucks taste and flavor.
2,cheap-looking,"I am accustomed to Seiko offering high-quality products. Not so here. The entire case is made of plastic and the back doesn't even match the front; it's black rather than the silver-colored plastic that covers the rest of the clock. It works well (so far--I bought it four or five months ago) and I like the ascending alarm sound since I hate to be jolted awake by what sounds like a fire department alarm in my ear. It's quite ok, but I hate the cheap plastic casing."
2,Potential unrealized,"As a native of the Adirondacks who spends his summer fun time in the Long Lake area which is the setting of the book, I looked forward to reading Lapointe's effort. However, I find that his effort was lacking. What we have here are 44 short vingnettes about what could be very interesting characters. And there lies the problem: Short. We only get bits and pieces on each subject, not enough to make us really care to any great extent. I do believe the subject matter is here for a truly great novel of Americana which would tie all these Adirondackers together through their love of survivinging in this harsh land. Instead, what we have are stories you might hear in any bar, donut shop, or back stoop. Interesting, maybe, but just the tip of the mountain."
5,No Other Grinder Compares,"If you are looking to have your own espresso set up at home, go all out the first time and you will never look back (or need another).Kitchen Aid has proven themselves once again with simply the best grinder there is! It is worth the extra money and you will be tickled pink.Thank You,Patricia S."
1,VERY Disappointed,"When I pulled it from the box I thought it was all scratched up. Looking closer it appears that the gray coating cracked in a million places but they clear-coated it anyway. The clear coat is smooth but it looks forever like its scratched all over. But I didn't buy it for its looks, so I gave it a try. It ran for maybe a total of 5 minutes over a couple of days then just STOPPED!!! Its as if it were unplugged. Completely dead. I paid a bunch to try and get a strong, quality item. I waited two months. The cheapest grinder I've ever had lasted longer."
3,Not Consistent Enough,"I bought this for making espresso. I was trying to get the perfect 20 to 30 second shot on my Gaggia Classic espresso machine. I adjusted for espresso as described in the manual, then I found that the 7.5 setting was just right (7 was way too coarse and 8 was way to fine). You can only adjust by half steps, so 7.5 it was. Everything was peachy keen for a while, and then the grounds became too coarse, so I changed my setting to 8 which was about right but a little too fine. I found that over time, the settings change quite a bit, so you have to use 7.5 one week, 8 the next, and then back to 7.5. This is even within the same batch of coffee. I wish I could just set it and forget it. The change in grind between settings is also way too much. I would like to have much finer resolution."
5,Favorite Movie,This is the most heart warming movie I've ever watched. I have watched this movie numerous times and still get very emotional with the end of movie. James Caan and Billie Dee Williams both do fantastic jobs in portraying these two caracters.
5,A Long Way Home,A boy's vivid account of his struggles and ingenuity during the holocaust years. A gripping tale of growing up & survival under the hardest of circumstances. A must read.
4,Excellent Writing & Story Telling,"I had never heard of this author before another author I admired recommened her. I liked the book very much. Character development is excellent. The reasons I gave the book a 4 rather than a five is for the following reasons:One, I know this is not a romance novel. So I did not expect that many love scenes. However, I felt that the loves scenes that did come up wasn't well thought out and surely deserved more than 5 or 6 sentences.There are few other things I want to mention that did not sit well with me regarding the cars vs. wagons, etc. I don't have the book close now to include excerpts.However, Black Gold was an excellent read, and highly recommend it if you love good writing and story telling. This isn't a romance novel. I thought I would warn the romance fans. Serious readers please dare to read this book."
2,Mummmmmmm,"This was not what I thought it would be.This is outline with plans for a year of school.Alot of things for you to gather-materials,reading books,etc.....Just was way too much work for me.So I opted another route,If you like to plan and gather-this is for you.I was glad I bought it used and not new."
4,"Great, if you like lime green...","I'm surprised no one else has mentioned this, but I think the color in the picture is off. The actual color of the flowers on the plates is more of a muted lime green. Not quite the color I wanted, but not ugly enough to return the set.On the plus side, every single piece arrived intact, no cracks or breaks anywhere. The plates are lightweight but don't feel fragile. I'm not wild about the square bowls (they're white with a lime green ring around the top) because I think they look kind of cheap. Four stars because I think I will love the plates once I get used to the color, and they are a huge improvement over the heavy stoneware I have now."
5,A keeper!,"A fabulous, ageless mix of Latin jazz, descarga, salsa, Latin pop... you name it, with guest appearances by the likes of Cachao, Chocolate, Anth. Carillo, Linda Tillery and many more. It is a mystery why producer John Santos didn't have a couple more family reunions. I played the CD until the cows came home..."
5,Fagon Elite double boiler steamer,"Item is excellent but the first one sent had cracks in the pan. The replacement was dented in the main pan due to inadequate packaging. We kept it anyway as the odds of getting a ""good"" replacement seemed poor."
2,Screw connecting handle to lid rusts,"The screw connecting the handle to the lid apparently is made of steel, and it rusts. After washing, this leads to rust flaking off of the screw and accumulating on the underside of the lid. Also the seal between the lid and the handle is not water tight. This leads to water accumulation in the handle, which ends up being rusty water. The lid is really not usable unless you do not mind having rust in your food. Otherwise, the pots are of reasonable quality. However, are not much use without a lid."
4,"Darn good,","darn good series, got to catch up on season 3. Getting all in to this blu-ray disc and the extra features."
1,$153!?!?!?!?! WOAH!!,"First let me say I love heroes so don't take my 1 star review as a review on the show itself for Heroes I would give a 6 out of 5. I just don't quite get the pricing on this, its $153 for this with only seasons 1 and 2, if you just buy seasons 1 and 2 seperatly on blu-ray, it only comes to only $89, so you'd be paying $64 extra just to buy them together in this ""Franchise Collection"". I mean really, you could even add in season 3 and STILL be cheaper than this. It makes even less sense to me that the prices I used to figure this out were all shipped and sold by amazon. Anyway, if you're thinking of buying Heroes on blu-ray, I would highly recommend it, Heroes is awesome and blu-ray is awesome quality. Just don't get it with this deal, buy them seperate and save a bundle!Heroes: Season 1 [Blu-ray]Heroes: Season 2 [Blu-ray]"
3,Sometimes insightful...often elusive,"Cuba Diaries, a new book by Isadora Tattlan, is a good read and deserves attention. Several of the anecdotes regarding the ""periodo especial"" in Cuba are insightful and reflect the daily realties faced by the victims of this 40 year-old totalitarian state. However, the author unnecessarily creates an ubiquitous veil, shrouding the identity of her husband, his business role and country of origin, i.e. Nick is from X----- or his X----ian language, and nullifying their interactions with government personnel and business associates. The book does not offer a true description of their personal situation or a root cause analysis of the surrounding economic crisis. Despite these failings, I recommend the book as a good source of anecdotal reference material for those people interested in studying this ""periodo especial"" and its effects on an American housewife in Cuba. Who knew?"
2,Experiences of a spoiled American housewife,"Cuba is changing very fast, therefore many books on Cuba are out of date short after they are pulished. The same applies to this book. The situation Isadora describes isn't realistic anymore. Futhermore are her experiences not representative, because she does not empathize with the Cuban society. And that is the biggest shortcoming of this book. In my opinion she creates an unjust and negative image of the Cuban people.I advise to read Enduring Cuba by Zoe Bran or Mi Moto Fidel bij Christopher Baker."
4,Great moves and works your heart,"I'm not an avid kickboxing person but I use it for variety. I have Janis's Quick Fix CD and neither of these are the same as far as moves so you can own both and be challenged. I enjoy the segmenting aspect of the CD starting with cardio, then drills, and then strength so the user can select from 1-2 or 3 sets and then cool down.The set is too small for the amount of people or vice versa and they were jammed in which doesnt allow you to see a low - med- or high impact version of the moves which would be nice. Some of the participants were not coordinated to Janis, the beat or themselves and looked awkward and often left in the dust- very obvious so.Overall, this is a great DVD and buy her Quick Fix (40min) and you'll have a nice inventory."
2,Not challenging,"I think this is a good workout if you are new to exercise or cardio kickboxing. I saw all the great reviews and bought it, but I think that it's going on to ebay. The paddle section bothers me, because even if I did want to buy these paddles to practice kicks on, I don't have anyone here that would want to hold them for me. I think maybe that section should be part of an instructional or bonus selection on the dvd."
4,Jab and kick,Good instruction on a wide variety of kicks. The paddle work can be done without the paddles to complete satisfaction. Lots of kick work.
3,Cheaply Made,"Unfortunately, this bird feeder is poorly made with cheap materials and fell apart after only a few weeks of normal use. I would not recommend purchasing it."
1,The Most frustrating Software I Have Ever Tried to Use.,"One would think that designing and printing an envelope should be straight forward. One would think that what you see on screen is what you would get when printing and that, since the software supports full bleed, you would not get a white border on two or three sides of an envelope. When printing a #10 envelope, the design prints on only 3/4 of the length. I have printed out the full manual which isn't much better than the software, in my opinion. My request for help from Support was ignored."
4,The Hardest Crosswords You'll Ever See,"I bought this book because I'm a huge fan of Mr. Lederer's work.Little did I know it would destroy me!The rules are a bit unclear in parts, however. While most of the puzzles are made of rhymes and puns, not every word in the puzzle falls into these categories. Sometimes you may be searching for the rhyme of your solution for an hour, then realize no rhyme is required.It may not be for me, as I don't spend too much time with crosswords. However, if you consider yourself rather agile with your vocabulary, or a master of puns, this book will be a true test of your skill."
2,a little disapointing,"Written content is very informative, but a bit disjointed. The reproduction of the plates is very poor, however considering the price ,maybe to be expected."
2,not so great overall,There is a lot of good info in the book if you could see the illustrations well enough to know what's going on. The book needs updating badly as far as I am concerned. Much of the photography was so dark you could tell very little about what was being shown in the picture. And did I miss the part about subhilt fighters Loveless is famous for. I was disappointed in the book overall. I wish I'd gotten a copy like the ones described with great photos and easy to read. Somebody owes me a new copy !
2,Not what I expected,This wig was not what I expected - it didn't even seem like the same wig that was pictured on the site (and even the package it came in). I sent it back for a refund.
3,"Stylish, Funny and Mediocre",The first 30 minutes of this movie rocks pretty good.The rest of it gets boring and turns into a sappy movie.The best Clooney movie? From Dusk Till Dawn!The best Mark Walberg movie? Haven't seen it yet ;)The Best Ice Cube movie? Friday!
1,I only watched the first few minutes...But that was enough.,"Actually, this isn't a review as I switched the TV off after the first few minutes - in which time I was deeply disturbed and offended...Maybe, maybe, the film later on might have explored the appalling inhumanity and racism shown by American soldiers in Iraq but who knows...I really was too disturbed at the time to want to continue watching.Moments from the first few minutes of the film - Iraqi being referred to as ""towelhead"" by an American soldier...Iraqi POW being shot like a hunted animal at point blank range by an American soldier who clearly does not feel much at all..."
3,"Meet the ""Three Godfathers,"" the Duke and John Ford","Looks like the ""Three Kings,"" which was advertised as the best original screenplay of 1999, resembles the ""Three Godfathers.""Wayne (Clooney) and his outlaw friends (Kings' soliders) get greedy, steal gold, and flee into the desert. Along the way they become the ""godfathers"" of a dying woman's baby (abandoned Iraqi rebels). They then get a conscience and realize they need to throw away their plans in order to save the baby (back to ""Kings"" abandoned Iraqi rebels). So some of the outlaws (soldiers) unfortunately die along they way.""Three Kings"" is a nice movie but give credit where credit is due. You just can't beat the Duke and John Ford! Ford and the Duke did give credit to the past film versions (5). They even dedicated ""Godfathers"" to the original star, Harry Carey, of the silent film version.Get the ""Three Godfathers."" You'll love it!"
2,What kind of movie is it? I don't know.,It's not a war movie . Neither it's an action nor a comedy. There are a few funny scenes.
2,3 UNCROWD KIGS,a odds flicks dads makles u woddle pucke. i dosan't understamnd why peps think if a flick is oidd it mujs be brillant. this flick is two much four me. it's a war movie a comedy and an action movie intwo 1[ De actins iz okey anz so isz the directing bute da rest fp thidz movieb is two far fetch. i didn'yt like the charctetrts and i didn't want to watc h thme foir two hoursn go watch a better mmvie like something bny spike lee...try gets on mhy bus insteda........word!
2,Three Kings,"Beware: All of you hoping to see a great movie look somewhere else. The movie was drawn out and lacked a certain explosiveness. George, Mark, and I-Cube all played good roles but like everyone else I enjoy seeing a change in backgrounds. The desert can get old quickly. So don't watch this with the hope that it will get better as it goes on because it doesn't."
1,Propoganda,"The fact that war has many different points of view is a moot point. Why, then, make ANOTHER movie about it? Full of innocuous pontification and one-dimensional characterization, this movie is as annoying as the original coverage of the war was back in 1991. The only puprose of this movie is for a very liberal Hollywood to take shots at a very conservative era that hasn't been dragged through the mud yet. Right or left, there's nothing worse than a propoganda movie and this one stinks of it."
3,BACK HAND SWIPE AT BUSH 41,"""Three Kings"" starred the ultra-liberal George Clooney in a convoluted story of U.S. soldiers trying to get rich in war torn 1991 Iraq, possibly re-creating the theme of Clint Eastwood's 1970 film ""Kelly's Heroes"". ""Kings"" is not a highly political story, but leaves little doubt that it views the first President Bush's war in Iraq, particularly the Kurdish uprising that he encouraged and did not back, as a cynical American lie.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF ""BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN""STWRITES@AOL.COM"
2,Dramatically Overrated....,"This movie has all the ingredients to be a Great movie (good actors, great plot, interesting story line)... but it FAILS TO DELIVER. The inaccurate portrayal of the American GI's makes them look very inept and childish (unfairly so), the editing is very poor (slow motion scenes are over done and the COLORS? ), and the plot quickly bogs down in the over done political over tones regarding the reason for the Gulf War. The actors do a very good job, but it's not enough. I very much wanted to like this movie, but it left me very disappointed. Do yourself a favor, RENT the movie before you buy."
2,Didn't know what to expect. but just don't get it.,"I didn't know much about the movie, seen some previews of it and I was anxious to see it. After seeing it I was very disappointed and I was tempted to even stop the movie and trash it. Acting is pretty good, storyboard is a new version of kelly's heroes, the way they shot the movie and cut it is really terrible. It's very annoying."
2,Glad I Rented It First,"I had this movie in my wish list for purchase at a later date. I decided to rent it. I saved myself the cost of purchase. This movie was terrible. Halfway through I almost turned it off. I'm a fan of military movies but this was completely uninteresting. The milk truck scene? Totally stupid. Like other reviewers have said, rent before you buy."
3,Cute little film but leaves a little at the end..,"Nice war time flick, but the overall premise misses in the end. It's a bit of a farce, if you think about it.It does however do a nice job of mixing stunts, a bit of drama, human plight, guns and blood, humor and irony. The explosions are gratuitous at best and the cow scene is borderline funny.It is worth a rental as opposed to a purchase, but for late night, nothing on cable and lets see how cranked up our DVD can get, then okay add it to your shopping cart."
4,Not Your Typical War Epic,"For an odd cinematic experience, watch Saving Private Ryan and then Three Kings. What a difference 40 years makes! Three Kings is the story of four soldiers during the Gulf War who decide to ""liberate"" Saddam's gold after the end of the war. Things go wrong and suddenly they are trying to help a band of Irqai citizens defect. The acting is wonderful (George Clooney is absolutely fabulous-one of the best actors working today)and the story is both funny and incredibly sad at the same time.One ""moral"" of the story that I enjoyed...what is right or wrong depends upon what side you are on."
5,This IS the best war movie.,A great war movies doesn't just have action. It has to have moral questions and right and wrong or it won't be realistic. This is a great film with many different elements involved. This is the kind of movie you buy because it really is special.
3,Worth watching.,"This is a good movie. I don't know if I would reccomend buying it, but it is definitely worth renting. People in the military could relate well with it. I watched it with my son who is in the Army and he explained a lot of things to me."
2,A travesty of the Middle East,"To describe Three Kings as absurdly comic is to describe a war as such. This film is filled with an excess of gratuitous violence and unnatural foul language. While greed & cruelty may be rampant in the region, Three Kings is simply absurd. At best, it is nerve wracking entertainment and does (handsome) George Clooney's reputation no favors whatsoever. Any Indiana Jones episode would run circles around this thin and preposterous plot. I would rate this ""B"" movie a miss on all fronts."
3,3-4 yr old loves it,My grandson really likes this series. Poor graphics and not well written but my grandson doesn't care about that.
3,Unsharpened,"The image shows two sharpened edges, however, the product comes unsharpened. Other than that, the product is as advertised and seems to be of decent quality."
5,A Must Read!!!,"Erna Cooper's The Venice Apartment & Other Stories takes you on a journey through life. Ms. Cooper's book has mystery, travel, and love. This collection of short stories brings a new genre of short story writing to the reader. Ms. Cooper's eloquent writing style is like a painter painting his or her brush strokes in a fine painting. The Venice Apartment & Other Stories opens your mind to intrigue and your heart for caring, which will bring many enjoyable hours of reading. I recommend this book in everyone's library collection.Claude J. Prince, Television Producer (Formerly with Fox Television)"
2,There are better mixers,"I lost my Braun mixer because I was in a flood.Trying to save a few bucks, I bought this mixer instead of a Braun.It takes much longer to beat egg whites, so I'm disappointed.I won't return it. It will have to do. But I'll always wish I had spent the extra dollars and purchased a good mixer"
2,Fancy screen saver,"To begin with, I'm a huge fan of photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand. I've seen his work in Chicago, and his messages (imagery & captions) are extraordinary. I have many of his books.This DVD is simply a screen saver. Not a documentary unlike I originally thought. I would highly recommendHome [Blu-ray] by the same director / photographer.Also, part of the low rating is that I watchedHome [Blu-ray] in blu-ray. Looking at the images of ""Earth From The Air"" in standard definition doesn't do the pictures justice. If this DVD is published in blu-ray, I would consider it."
4,WOrks great if no user error,"This little thing does just what it says works wonderful motor is wonderful even though I see many reviews of it being a bad machine I disagree mine is on its 4th year in the first year it did give me an issue but that was my bad for not adding pump conditioner over the winter since they do hold some water I am guessing it frozen and made the re-circulator go bad for 25 bucks it was fixed and there actually was a video on how do it online. ever since 1-2 pulls and I am off and running I do my house, patio,riding and push mower and I also have done concrete cleaning with it . Maintance has to be my #1 down fall but I cant blame the machine for it."
1,Karcher Pressure Washer,"Bought and used four times before the 1st swivel adapter broke. Have to purchase from Karcher at a cost of $4.99 each. I bought multiple, but also complained to Karcher they should develop an alternative to brass. Also, complained about Karcher accessories I purchased via Amazon, that do not fit. Buyer beware, unless, manufacturer or Amazon addresses."
1,Changed product - flimsy bags that rip very easily,"These bags used to be great; however, they have changed the design. Instead of a straight line perforation, now it's curved so that it's extremely hard to tear off a new bag without ripping a hole in the next one. Even when I try to tear a bag at the perforation carefully, the bag rips, causing me to go through several bags before I get to one without a hole in it. It's obvious they are trying to cut corners and use less material, but as a result, we will not be buying these bags again. What a terrible design."
4,Perfect and a lot cheaper than the ones at the pet store,"If you dont use these bags in a holder--get them, its a major convenience. These bags are way cheaper than the ones you get at the pet store and for a disposable--a bag is a bag and they all fit on the same holders."
5,Bargin!!,"This is such a great bargin for the amount of bags, I love that they are easy to use and slip right into the holder on my dogs leash so I am never without them."
5,Same as the pet store but cheaper,Same as the pet stores but much cheaper the quality is just as good and pet stores with out the hassle.
3,Dog poop bags,"These were the first dog poop bags I tried, mainly because they were cheap. I did notice that a few bags had cut along the crease but other than that, the rolls were OK. I never had any break but they are thin so I handled them carefully. I now use a different, thicker poop bag -- just don't want to worry about a poop bag breaking or leaking while I'm carrying it or after I put it in my garbage can."
5,Very convenient.,"These bags are really convenient. They are also very cheap in price. At the 4 for 3 price that Amazon has, each bag used comes out to 5 cents. I was purchasing these at a pet store at roughly $12 until I noticed them on amazon. For about $6 I was extremely happy purchasing them. Then the 4 for 3 deal comes along and makes this an even better deal. The little roll is pretty small and can fit in your pocket pretty comfortably."
2,Did these shrink?,I've ordered the smaller packages of the Bags on Board and these seem smaller. Disappointing since the per-unit price was essentially the same and I did not get a 'bulk' discount for buying the larger package.
2,Disappointed - substitution,"I have been using these Bags on Board for 4 years. They have become shorter - but I didn't really complaint about that. Now, however, I felt the need to write. The last order I received is made differently - with little ties at the top. These are more flimsy than they once were, and now you have to try to tie the little tabs at the top in order to close the bag.If you are going to sell something - and are planning to change the design, you should show it so that everyone can clearly see (no it was not listed in the item description) that it has been changed.I will not buy these bags again."
1,Worst redesign ever,"Who ever decided that the bag shape needed to be redesign, who ever redesigned it and who ever approved of the design should be fired. I use to like this bags, the were convenient, environmentally friendly and easy to use (not that there is a science behind the use of poop bags). Now someone went and decided to change the rectangular shape of the bags to what I guess is the shape of a hand. First this makes them very difficult to detach an individual bag out of the dispenser, they do not cut out as easily as before. And, if you are going to redesign them into the shape of a hand, or what ever you call the new shape, what happened to the thumb! At least before you could use one of the corners now it is very difficult to ""perform the task"" they are intended for. O.K., there is a saying it holds true more often than not: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.Bags On Board Refill Bags Pack 21 Rolls 315 Bags Clean-Up"
5,Great!!,"These bags are great for doggie clean up. Yes I have newspaper bags but they periodically have holes and tears. Also, they are quite flimsy. The Bags on Board are sturdy and have a wide opening making clean up much easier. Also, they are very easy to carry if you get a Bags on Board dispenser which I attach to my dog's leash."
5,Heavy Duty Bags,"Bags on Board are the best! There are some other brands out there, but they are thin and flimsy. I don't worry about Bags on Board bags breaking."
5,They're plenty big enough for larger breeds,"I've used these for years; they're plenty big enough for our needs. My 70 pound Aussie averages two gifts per walk, my 10 pound rescue Heinz just one. I can use one bag for all three operations with plenty of room to tie a knot when done. The hard part is keeping that stinky thing at arm's length while waiting for the full complement to be deposited."
5,great for the environment,"i like the bags on board for my dog b/c they are environmentally friendly, and better than other alternatives. i can't live without them."
1,Awful - used to be good - not now,"We have 4 dogs and I foster dogs all the time. This was the only bag I would ever use - no holes, did not rip easily. They changed them to be less plastic (which is a great concept). But they are now thinner and have curves which don't separate easily. I now waste 1-2 bags per roll and I bought the box - ick! I will not buy these again - they are a waste of time and money and now worse than other comparable bags."
1,Too Short!,"Earlier versions were good. Now they are trying to save money and making them much too short. I think they may lose in the end, as I for one will not be buying these again. Save your money."
2,Perforation design does not work,"The perforation for separating bags is ""S"" shaped to make ""ties"". It is very difficult to follow and the bag rips easily making the next bag unusable. Don't try to use at night unless you have a light and three hands."
1,Bags have Shrunk,"I have been very happy with these bags for years, but they just changed the size of the bags. They are much much smaller bags, which is tough if you have a normal sized dog. Now there isn't room to tie a knot because they are so much shorter....dirty trick by the Bags on Board people."
1,Short Bags,"These bags are 12 inches long.I wanted the 14 inch bags.Why doesn't the description tell what size the bags are ?The description tells what size the package of 120 bags are, but what good is that ?I am sending these bags back."
1,NOT Biodegradable at all!!!!,"Like others on amazon, I've recently learned that the fine print under 100% Biodegradable ""*except in California,"" means that they are NOT following California state guidelines, which means a product must be biodegradable at the rate of an apple. They are stating ""100% Biodegradable,"" which merely means, ""in about one million years or so, this will start to fall apart and degrade."""
5,Everything you'll need to fish-except the rod and reel!,"Whether you've been fly-fishing five minutes or fifty years, you can learn something from Lefty Kreh. And thank God, he's willing to teach. Primarily that's what this book is all about, teaching. Kreh sets out in clear, straight forward prose, the lessons he has learned from a lifetime on the water. Literally everything is in here. Questions as diverse as how to cast and what clothing to wear are covered. As is proper wading technique, knots and leaders, tackle selection, and more, all to introduce the concept of presnting the fly to the fish, because that's really what it's all about. What it boils down to is this, you buy this book and apply the lessons it contains and you will be a better fisherman. Period."
2,resolution lacking,"Most pictures are too out of focus to use, but every once in a while you get something really clear.Had lots of trouble getting it to work with out computer since it didn't come with instructions, we downloaded a driver from the company website that unnecessarily blocked the auto config. process. Very tough to press buttons when using waterproof casing."
4,a good product,it was a good item and everyone should have one. they are the right size. the item is what I was looking for
3,No Charge,"Everyone has a story to tell. Many,many, many, many women have gone through what this author has gone through and much, much more. However, she was fortunate enough to have her life story in print and for sale. I find it obnoxious to sell testimonies. It's spiritually abusive. God-help books (not self-help books) from Christians should be FREE. There are ways to help defray the costs of printing and distribution. The publishing houses are just too greedy, selling their own souls. What will it PROFIT to gain the world and lose your soul? Now this is TRUE FOOD FOR THOUGHT."
5,Great Way to Teach Our Kids,"I can now read the stories of the bible in ways she can understand. :)) I love this little bible with it's great illustrations and short but sweet lengths. It's great for my 4 year old. I even ask her to state back to me what happened after each story, and she gets it!! Thank you"
4,very pleased with quality,"I bought these Plan Toy dollhouse furniture sets as a natural, but cheaper alternative to some of the really pricey ones on another site. I was extremely pleased with the quality of these - they are smooth, pleasant to hold, attractive and sturdy. I bought the children's bedroom, the adult bedroom, the living room, and the bathroom, all classic style, and have been pleased with all of them.PLEASE NOTE: with the Classic Style bathroom set specifically, the lid of the toilet is not attached in any way to it, it simply rests on it, either up or down. I wish I had know this before, as I probably would have ordered the blue neo set instead; dollhouses have enough tiny parts without one extra that should really be attached with a hinge or what have you! At any rate, it is something to note."
4,nice pictures but we need more,"I recently purchased this book and like how Bruce explains what was going on in his head in every album from Greetings from Asbury Park to The Ghost of Tom Joad. The book has some great in-studio photos of Bruce and other E Streeters as well. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is there is so much more to the man other than the albums. He's basically mute about his personal life, touring,comments about his work by critics etc. Hopefully he has one more book down the road that will address these subjects."
2,Not much to read,"There is very little a Springsteen fan can enjoy, learn or read by buying this book. Basically, it consists of all the lyrics of every album packed in a rather expensive and heavy book. But the lyrics are in the albums themselves, and even those from the second album (which didnt contain them originally) can be easily found on the net. The pictures are few and the written pages are not many. I read the whole book in a couple of hours. I was disappointed because I like to read and I was expecting many days in company of the Boss and his comments about his songs.I dont see much sense in printing the lyrics of Bobby Jean (to put an example) first with Bruce's own handwriting in a full page, and then the same lyrics type written on the next page... and so on, album after album. Only some brief notes by The Boss at the beginning of each album. So you better go and buy a book about the Boss that can actually be READ."
5,Excellent book and resource,"I enjoyed this book very much. Being a Springsteen fan for 30 years, it was interesting to get Bruce's input on his inspiration for writing specific songs, and learning the background to them. I actually used the information in book for a research paper that I wrote for my college English class.Very good and entertaining, any Springsteen fan will enjoy this. The only thing negative I would say is, I do wish Bruce had written more on each song, going into more detail. Some songs you get a lot of insight from him on why/how he wrote the song, but some are just a couple of lines."
5,wonderful!,Springsteen's comments on each of his albums are deeply thoughtful and its profoundly inspiring to see how deeply he thinks about what he does. The book is also beautifully laid out.
1,Deceptive Seller,"Seller is making copies of books and sending photo copies instead of the advertised book. Seller won't respond to purchaser request for refund. Seller stated in product details ""Collectable, very good with no dust jacker, paperback"", which implies a book of collectable value. I received a very poor, mostly unreadable photocopy."
3,Very mixed bag,"It's a pity - some photos in this book are incredible. They're evocative, and they tell a story... a different story with each viewer, perhaps. They capture a moment or a mood perfectly. However, there are also run-of-the-mill pictures in it, and some are just boring. All in all, it might be worth buying the book just for the good pictures, especially if you've seen them in a review for example - but don't be too disappointed by the others."
2,A waste of my time,"This is the first book I have read by D. Clegg and it will probably be my last. The book started off well enough and held my attention but the last third of the book was deplorable. I was eager for the end so I could start reading something more interesting. Yes, I did finish it, it's rare for me not to finish a book that I've started."
2,Repetitious Babble Leads to Lousy Ending,"I was eager to get into this book, my first Clegg. The story started fast and then slowly fizzled out to nothing but repetitive psycho babble, an unbelievably weak protagonist, PG sex scenes and a lost storyline. I ignored the typos and amateurish formatting, thinking the story would get better. It didn't. The ending was nothing short of ridiculous. Did Mr. Clegg grow weary of this novel and say to himself, ""Oh, I've got a great idea for this one; let's overuse deus ex machina and leave the readers scratching their heads muttering, ""What the ...?"" My own fault, really. I usually read a sampling of reviews - the good, the bad and the indifferent before deciding to buy. I didn't on this one, sold as I was on the description and sample read. I won't make that mistake again."
1,This is the Item that Killed STAR WARS for me.,"Once again...the fact that you CAN do something...doesn't mean you HAVE to.This is a marketing gimmick that has no reason to even exist.Other than to get money out of your pocket.There is no point to it. I'd love to see the expression on your face when you show ""Episode IV:A New Hope"" on DVD or Blu-Ray or whatever format they re-edit them to your 6 Year old kid an he asks ""When will Han Solo's ship transform into 2 Robots?"". What will you say?Well, Maybe George Lucas will add that scene for the HD-DVD and make them better an longer for the Blu-Ray Collection.Disappointing."
3,very little taste,"I was happy to find this gluten free cereal available, but am disappointed in the taste - I'm not tasting ""honey nut"". In fact, these have very little taste."
2,NO FLAVOR!! Don't waste your money.,"I normally like glutino but their honey nut flavor is so boring and the texture is wierd. Apple cinnamon flavor is significantly better so if you are buying one of the two definately go with the apple cinnamon. However, the best gluten free cheerio is PerkyO's Frosted Cheerio. Amazon......WHY is it not for sale on your site??? PerkyO's is excellent in size of the ""O"" as well as taste. In my opinion the frosted PerkyO is better, more flavorful than the original brand but amazon needs to sell both. Especially for the young toddler that needs just the right size for their little fingers, the original is a good choice for them as well as for those of you who don't like sugar much."
5,Worked as Promised,Worked as promised. Make sure to dry then apply. Do not rinse immediately. Let solution dry and then rinse. Worked no more fog.
4,anti empañante,"excelente producto de olor un poco fuerte, pero tolerable. muy bueno para evitar el ahumado de los lentes..."
4,A Feeling for the Organism: The Life and Work of Barbara McClintock,"A very short review of this incontournable book, for all those that want to better know the scientific world or that have interest in the female conditions throughout the 20 century. Those thinking that scientists are a bit ""crazy"" or mystical will probably find unvaluable arguments in McClintok's personality!The book is well writen and easy to read; even for people that do not have a background in genetics. From my point of view, those people will nevertheless have more interest in the aspects of ""McClintock's as a female revolutionary scientist"" rather than in ""the genesis and communication of new ideas in life-science"".Most of the information provided about McClintok's life and thoughts seem acurate, even if some authors have pointed out several speculations made by Evelyn Fox Keller."
1,Follow-up Review (Terrible quality production),"Now that I have viewed the entire program, I felt compelled to follow up my original review by stating that the technical standards of this disc are ABSOLUTELY AWFUL! Terrible tracking lines, shimmering, grainy video - everything about it is terrible. Film clips look as if they were taken from a second generation bootleg dub. Content aside, the quality is terrible. Fox Lorber has always been a poor quality company, releasing classic films with bad transfers and no extras, and this is just like them."
4,Unobtrusive but it doesn't float,"Stays put, but unlike a pair of nose clips I used to have, they don't float. I lost one of these already."
3,Preferred Previous Version Of These Goggles,"These work fine but the previous, flesh colored ones before were a bit thicker and studier. The plastic on one of these charcoal clips actually wore through to the wire in a few months. So I keep a stash of them as I do not trust them to last."
2,Very uncomfortable,Very uncomfortable to wear and it hurts my nose and leaves my nose red after my swim. But I don't know what else to use. I wish they would find something that will be comfy and not hurt.
1,"Nice idea, poor construction","I've tried three different nose clips from Speedo, and they're all horrible, just as this one is. I think I have an average-sized nose, but the clip slips right off. Do not buy."
3,nose plug,This is better than the plastic kind because you get a better fit. The trouble is that it is easy to lose it. Come up with a string to secure it better and it will get 5 stars.
3,Slips off,"I bought this to use in a swim class, but was prohibited from using them. Even so, I used it occasionally in the pool in my apartment complex. It's not UNcomfortable, but it doesn't stay on as securely as I would have hoped."
5,Exceptionally good product,"I've been using 2 of these cloths for the last 5 years..This is one product that actually does everything promised...just dry cloth to dust, wash when dirty, use over & over again...The window cleaner cloth is unbelievable..I really didn't believe just water & a cloth would clean windows without streaking,but it does..I'm ordering this set just in case my 2 eventually wear out...I wanted to let everyone know that these cloths save time, money, and leave no lingering chemical fumes like commercial cleaners. I want this product to remain in production..That's the reason for the 5 star ratings & my first review for amazon.com & I've been a member for 10 years."
1,Tedious repetition,"There is really nothing new here. If you've seen one of his books, you have seen them all. Many ideas are quite dated."
3,Hum... lot of ads in it!,"The book looks nice and it gives some ideas, but not as much as I expected. They are not so original. What I found worse is that there is a LOT of ads hidden in the hints, like this one, taken randomly, number 213:Timid about shopping in a lingerie shop? That's what catalogs are for!Victoria Secret Catalog -- 800-888-8200, [...]Frederic's of Hollywood Catalog--800-323-9525, [...]Playboy--........Dream Dresser--........Three Whishes Lingerie--........Moonliting Lingerie & Costume Company--........Coquette International--........and so on!On top of that, I'm not living in the US, so it's completely useless for me.Think twice before buying it."
2,Not very useful,"Most of the suggestions in this book are corny and feed into antiquated gender stereotypes. I can see where it might be useful if you have been married for twenty years and desparately need some new ideas. However, if you are under fifty, you will likely be annoyed by the lack of originality and the repeated product placement."
1,John Wayne 20 Movie Pack,"Not a good choice. Way too many ""B"" type movies on this DVD. I would not recommend this purchase."
4,I'm a big John Wayne fan.,"Unfortunately, I haven't watched any of these movies yet. Many of these movies were made prior to John Wayne becoming a star. Most of these werelow budget westerns. I expect to enjoy them soon. We went to his birthplace in Winterset,Iowa which was very interesting."
2,Couldn't get into this one...,"I have 2 CD's by this artist. I bought one for relaxation, massage, mediatation, and one to impart a bright and lively mood for the beginning of the day. This recording is OK, but not special in my opinion. The music is bright and lively, but for me, not engaging or inspired and doesn't seem to have a flow. I was looking for music I could put on in the morning as background as I started my day and find myself smiling over. I just found this mildly irritating. My other Deuter CD, ""Wind & Mountain"" is wonderful and perfect for all of the relaxing applications that I had in mind when I bought it. I have listened to Sun Spirit serveral times and at different times of the day, just to give it a fair listen, but I don't like it and won't be keeping it in my collection."
3,Good work-out if you have the right equipment,"I love Janis Saffell's work-outs. I bought most of her DVDs and I am a happy customer ;o) However, this DVD was a disappointment for me. You need some extra equipment for this DVD: You need a 'step' to step up and down. I did not know this when I bought the DVD and I cannot do half of the exercises on this DVD because I do not have the right equipment. (And I also do not want to buy any big equipments). I am writing this comment as a warning to other Janis fans. Regards..."
1,kick it,kick it out of your cart this is a insult to kick boxing and your hard earned money do not buy this i wouldn't give this to someone i didn't like
3,Gotta have it!,"Favorite tracks are 9, 16, and 14. It's a fun musical experience. Great stuff! Gotta have the cool packaging too."
5,YUMMY and easy to bake,"This was my first attempt at baking my own bread. Determined to get off of gluten, I'll try anything.It was a breeze, and the first loaf was perfect!Just followed the directions.Has an interesting whole-gran, almost nutty taste which I also like.Ordering some more tonight."
5,Best GF bread!,"This is by far my favorite gluten-free bread, and I have tried many! It holds together so well (many GF breads are crumbly and fall apart easily) and makes great toast or sandwiches. It has a savory flavor that is unique, and it is now the only GF bread I will buy."
2,Strong Caraway seed flavor,"I love Bob's Red Mill products and was happy to see a whole grain gluten-free bread mix, but if you don't like caraway seeds, this is not the mix for you. Even combining this mix with another didn't take away the caraway seed flavor for me."
1,"Good ""Rye"" bread not what I wanted","I was excited about this gluten free ""hearty whole grain bread mix"" but when I made it I found it to be just too much going on. With the cocoa powder and sugars in there and all those grains (I did like the sunflower seeds though) it felt more like a mix between a brownie and bread... it had a strong, dark rye smell and feel to it. Not bad if that's what you're looking for but I was wanting something more middle of the road, more of a good, medium brown bread with a bit of grains in there but not with all that dark cocoa, sesame seeds and the sweet-ish, brownie quality. Bob's should re-name this mix to ""Hearty whole-grain ""Rye-Style"" bread mix."
2,"Good for you, Tastes Horrible!","It may be whole grain and thus heart healthy but I did not like the taste at all. I eat almost everything whole grain/organic, so ""natural"" taste does suit me well but in this case the carraway seeds are overpowering. I feel like I am eating a suet cake for birds."
2,Too much caraway seed,We did not enjoy this bread which I made in the bread machine. The texture was wet and spongily unappetizing . The caraway seed was overpowering. My husband could not finish one slice. I ate mine reluctantly. The next morning the loaf had taken on a dankness that I can only describe as...swampy. I threw it away. The dog didn't even want it.
2,Tastes bad,I like Bob's Red Mill cereals and I generally prefer the taste of whole-grain products. But this bread tastes bad. I put a lot of jam on it but still couldn't mask the bad taste. I give it two stars for the list of ingredients -- this might be the first time I ate bread made out of beans.
5,honees drops,"I love this product. I discovered these when I lived in NYC; now I live in LA and cannot find them anywhere...so, I am incredibly grateful that they are available through Amazon.They are decently priced and I appreciate the speedy delivery.Thank you!Jennifer"
4,Sci-fi for people who don't believe in little green men,"After reading this book twice in the space of two years I can honestly say that this is both a fine novel, a philosophical primer and a fabulous movie waiting to happen. By casting a woman as the books anti-hero (and she's certainly not perfect) whilst avoiding gratuitous sex and fragility Kerr gives us someone we can trust and believe in. The bond that builds between the books primary characters echoes reality more than convention and he's unafraid of making relationships and concepts so complex that easy answers are impossible. Anyone who enjoys being entertained and stimulated simultaneously, or who thought that ""Seven"" was a great movie should read this book. If all you've read from Kerr has thus been disapointing, trust me his talent is far more reliable than his consistancy."
3,Not exactly symphonic...,"I needed some instrumental Prince music for a program I was scoring, and this appeared to be what I needed, and the Amazon reviews were good. Well, it certainly is not like a symphony playing orchestral arrangements of Prince songs (like say the London Symphony Orchestra doing Rolling Stones songs). It is obviously a small ensemble, the arrangements sound very basic - actually, being on the same label, these bear a resemblence to the ""String Quartet Tribute to..."" series, but not as good. The lead vocal is often replaced by saxaphone, which doesn't jive well with the string instruments. I think the ""symphonic tribute"" title is stretching things a bit, as these mostly sound small-scale and a bit cheesy. Some of the ""String Quartet Tribute to"" discs are actually pretty good (like the Janet Jackson one), but this collection doesn't do the originals justice, and is not arranged or performed on a scale to reinvent the songs symphonically."
3,Collectible cards are fun for all ages.,Cards in great condition and arrived quickly. Pictures bring back memories of watching the original Star Trek on television.
4,This is the Jazz Casual Show Released Elsewhere,This is nothing new. This is the Jazz Casual show. It's great music but if you love 'Trane you already have it. The same can be said of Trane Tracks which includes all of what is in Jazz Legacy but it is edited with excerpts that make it easier to listen to. So you have the two to choose from; full performances on Jazz Legacy and the same excerpted in Trane Tracks. I love both equally.
5,never ending story of a warrior!!,"God, Mastamind is crazy good. and it is about time he came out solo. He was long overdue to make a solo album. I am satisfied that I bought this cd, all the songs are good. And let me tell you something, I saw Mastamind at the Twiztid concert and he blew away Twiztid, he was the best of the show no doubt. Mastamind, keep doing your thing. I'm enjoying it.Peace"
4,Impressive...,"I didn't expect this album to be so good, Mastamind really steps it up a notch. Coming from a being a member of Natas and being over looked because Esham has such a strong presents in the group, but Mastamind drops a great solo none the less."
2,RISK.. FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT ??!!,"MEGADETH risked ruining their careers with this album. The result: Friedman left the band. It's a boring album, I'm not complaining because it sounds commercial ( in my opinion, it doesn't). It's just that the tunes are annoying and weak, a real mess, just noise. Nothing here is comparable to ""RUST IN PEACE"" or ""COUNTDOWN TO EXTINCTION"" or ""CRYPTIC WRITINGS"". ANyway,b eing MEGADETH, there are few moments of musical mastery here."
2,First Metallica and now Megadeth :-(,"I don't understand, I thought the metal era was over until I was at Iron Maiden concert in Stockholm, Sweden. 13,000 fans had gathered to listen to HEAVY METAL and I was overjoyed that Megadeth also was there as the opening band. Mostly they played the old goodies like Symphony of destruction, Holly wars and etc. This shows that Metal is not dead and there are still fans all over the world so Megadeth dudes WAKE UP!About this CD: This is definitely not the Megadeth I grew up with and used to head-bang to. It is a shame that another king of metal and one of my most favorite bands is going down the hill. If you like good hard rock go and buy this CD but if you are looking for METAL........ Sorry!"
2,"SUDDEN CHANGE ! CHANGE IS GOOD, BUT ""RISK"" IS?","Hey, let's suppose you're a Megadeth fan (not a """"metal"", ""death"" or anything else, simply a Megadeth fan). Without taking consideration for their reasons or the musical style involved, I'd like you to hear this question and answer honestly: which MEgadeth CD is better: ""COuntdown to Extinction"" or ""Risk""? ""Cryptic Writings"" or ""Risk""? ""Rust in Peace"" or ""Risk""?. I don't care if they change and play folk, rap or techno as long as it is good,as long as it is Megadeth. And that is not the case in ""Risk"". MAybe I'll learn to like it with time."
4,You takes your chances...,"Okay, this album isn't that risky. It's definitely got pretensions for mass acceptance though. Bad move, Dave. You've always been an edgy guy and you should embrace that. Hmm, what's to like? The album cover is kinda neat. I even like the new logo. BREADLINE is a pretty cool song, so is ECSTASY. CRUSH 'EM is terrible though and doesn't even belong in a WWF arena. Okay, most of the songs are blah. I give Dave credit for taking a chance, even if it was for all the wrong reasons. Four stars for the album cover."
1,"RISK this from your discography, Megadeth !","Horrible. I don't care if it is worst than their alst albuns or different. I'm not comparing it. I'm just analyzing as a supposely heavy album. It is horrible, the songs are simply not good enough. It becomes clear why Marty Friedman left the boat."
2,This is not Megadeth,"Why have you changed your style? Please, not another Metallica and their Load. Machine Head did it, Metallica did it, and now Megadeth did it. You want to sell cds, well, stay loyal to your roots. You played real music: fast, with real lyrics, and almost symphonic. But now, listening to what Jimmy De Grasso can do in the A.N.I.M.A.L. ""Poder Latino"" cd, and then listening what he is forced to do in Risk... I won't waste my time. Megadeth, you died for me."
1,megadeth risk,"This album was hard to swallow. I don't know where Dave Mustaine was going with this. The title alone makes no sense unless the RISK was to see how many fans you could annoy. First of all this band used to have a drummer named Nick Menza. This guy was amazing. The drum parts were so much fun to listen to. This new guy Degrasso may be a good drummer but on this album the drumming is so lame. Seriously my 10 year old nephew had the bulk of this albums drum parts down in about 3 hours no exaggeration. If you want to hear amazing music from these guys then check out Cryptic Writings,Youthanasia,Countdown to Extinction and Rust in Peace. All of these albums were done with their best line up which included Menza on drums. A note to Mustaine. Please take a look at the fact that your album was on billboard for less than 10 weeks as a sign that the bulk of your fans disliked this. We don't mind you taking risks just rememeber to make it rock like your other great albums."
4,Very Good Release,"Ok...so it's not speed metal. The best bands alway evolved over time and Megadeth is no exception.What makes this CD so good is the consistancy of the songs and the sequencing. The CD flows very nicely throughout and keeps your interest. After ""Prince of Darkness"" and ""Crush Em"" comes along ""Breadline"". Heavy to melodic. The secret here is balance. It's great to hear the heavy stuff along with the more melodic stuff. This is a CD to listen all the way through. No real filler(thank goodness they didn't load it up with 15 or 16 tracks...less is more when you don't have to keep the remote around to skip tracks). Dann Huff helps so much with the sequencing as he did on ""Cryptic Writings"". It's still Megadeth, but with a more rounded approach at the songwriting and the (whole) listening experience.Highly recommended if your not a die hard speed metal guy/girl."
1,Risk in the disc,"I'm a metal fan, and like every metal fan it makes me happy to put my hands on new material from great bands like Megadeth. When I purchased Risk, I knew I should have expected something different, my friends had told me that much. But I've tried to set aside everything I've heard before and listened to Risk just like a Megadeth fan who had just put a new Megadeth album in his home stereo without any forethoughts. Unfortunately, I failed to get into the album, the feeling of nativity when I was listening to Megadeth simply wasn't there. There were too many synthetic sounds which were tiring to listen and they prevented me from properly listening to riffs, vocals and drums, too. The main instruments which built up Megadeth's sound during all those years were simply hidden behind a thick wall of annoying synthetic sounds. After a while, I was really tired of all that and I had to eject the CD and put Rust in Peace into the CD tray."
5,Well worth buying! great album!,"Well, I thought it was going to be a pretty poor album... but how wrong I was. It's ace, the 'risk' they took to go into a new direction has certainly paid off. Dave has mastered his voice & it sounds ace (not as agressive as his past outings). With great songs such as 'Crush em' and 'WanderLust' & 'Seven' &... I know, why don't you just buy the album yourself & find out how amazing this album really is."
2,"Well, well, well......","What happened here? I was so pumped to get this cd. This cd is a disaster. Prince of Darkness is the best song on here. That is the only reason I gave it 2 stars. I would have given it 3 stars, but Prince of Darkness is nothing but recycled MetallicA music. Has anybody ever heard of ""one."" That is a great riff, but MetallicA plays it better. The verse for Prince of Darkness is a slight variation on ""Bad Seed."" Again, MetallicA played it better. And don't forget, this is the best song!! Crush 'em is ok, but it is so cheesy. I mean, did they really need the lame intro? The last two songs should be one track, not 2. I kept looking for Bon Jovi printed somewhere on the cd, but I couldn't find it. If only they could have taken a real risk...."
1,THIS IS NOT MEGADETH!,"Well what happend to megadeth. The same thing that happened to metallica. They went down the toilet! .This is not metal!. If you want metal, listen to any other megadeth album.This is trash!. The name does imply the right thought though, you would be taking a RISK buying this album, so don't!"
3,Have Faith in a Legendary Band,"Although this album is nothing like the Megadeth we fell in love with, everyone needs to ease up on the band! This album is loaded with good ideas if you just give it a chance. Anyone who claims to be a Megadeth fan and is so willing to ""jump off"" the fan train, was no Megadeth fan to begin with. ""Crush 'Em"", ""Breadline"", and ""Insomnia"" are great songs no matter who the artist is! All of Megadeth's albums should be standard equipment in any fan's collection. Give this album a chance, it will grow on you!"
1,Megadeth's worst album,"Megadeth's Eighth albumRisk will leave a bitter taste in your mouth after hearing it. You might think as I did that you have to hear it a few more times to let it sink in. It does not matter how many times you listen to it, your still gonna feel an empty void afterwards. If your a hardcore Megadeth fan your sooner or later gonna get it no matter what anybody says so take my advice and don't expect anything from it. That might ease the pain. If you take the album for what its worth you might at least find a few tracks you like. Prince of Darkness is actually a good song. However with Prince of Darkness being the albums only redeeming quality, I think this album more than earns it one star rating."
2,"C'mon Dave, stop copying Metallica","I am seriously disappointed with Dave Mustaine and Co. Why is it that they must copy whatever Metallica does? Metallica decided to play radio-friendly ""metal"", so what does Megadeth do? They put out an album of radio friendly ""metal"". Now, don't get me wrong, it is a decent album. ""Crush 'Em"" is catchy, ""Prince of Darkness"" shows signs of life, and ""Wanderlust"" is a cool tune. The songs are well written, hard rock anthems. That is the whole problem, though. They don't rock. Listen to ""I'll Be There."" That song reminds me of the Friends theme song. This band is just a shadow of the band that wrote heavy music like ""Train of Consequences"", ""Holy Wars...The Punishment Due"", and ""In My Darkest Hour."" Heck, they are a shadow of the band that wrote Cryptic Writings."
1,forget about it,The only decent song is Breadline. Get cryptic writings or peace sells or even Md.45 which rips.
2,have to agree...,"I did not like, or could finish, this book. I just could not like these characters. Especially Rosalinda's sister-annoying as hel*! I would have loved to throttle her:(My advice-skip it.2 stars for the books only redeeming feature-lovely cover art by Pino."
2,It's not a large clock-dimensions are incorrect!,"This clock was supposed to be 5 x 4 x 1 inch-it's about 2 1/2"" by 1"" by 3/4"". I bought it for my car but it's not large enough!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Had to return the clock. Would not keep time. Within an hour, it was off by over 20 minutes."
1,Can't review what I can't see,"It's hard to review a product when it doesn't even turn on. I put the battery in and yes, I put it in positive side facing out. And wait for it........ NOTHING! What a bummer."
4,"Fabulous, but very sweet and thick -- like it's supposed to be!","I think this product does just fabulously for what it is. In a base of coconut oil, they steeped some very very sweet smelling flowers. Some people find them delightful, others overwhelming. I find it varies with my mood.The pure coconut oil base is excellent for coarse hair, rough elbows/knees/feet and any other part of the body that could benefit from a thick, unctuous moisturizer/protective barrier. As the scent (tipanie/frangipani/plumeria -- all names for the same thing) is infused in a saturated fat, it takes a long time for it to fade. I like this -- and as a result, tend to use it in small quantities as an accent scent. I'll only douse myself with it in high summer when the high heat will evaporate most of the scent off my sweaty body rather rapidly.The scent is genuine, not perfumey, but I can't say this enough -- very very sweet. Probably why one reviewer didn't like the product."
5,This is an AMAZING album...Buy It!,"This is Superdrag's back to basics album. After experimenting with different sounds on their second album ""Headtrip In Every Key"", they went back to just using guitars, bass, drums and vocals on this album. The album opens with what is quite possibly, the best ""f**k you"" to the music industry which they belonged to. The song is ""Keep It Close To Me"". There isn't a bad song on this album. Not a single song. Every song on this album is Classic Superdrag. This is the album I tell friends to pick up if they want to be introduced to the band. Then you should pick up ""Headtrip In Every Key"", ""Last Call For Vitriol"", ""The Fabulous 8-Track Sounds Of Superdrag"", ""Greetings From Tennessee E.P."", and lastly ""Regretfully Yours"". I think their first album is quite possibly their weakest effort. Once you're done wearing out these albums, pick up John Davis' self-titled first solo album!!! thanks"
2,A milk-toast book on horses and horse care,As a first time horse owner and long-time animal lover I found that this book touched so lightly on subjects related to horses and horse care that I found it frustrating. It skimmed over subjects that warranted more information. I didn't feel after reading it that I had the information I needed. There certainly is some good information in the book but left me searching for better books on horses and horse care.
3,"Poor introduction, Outstanding reference","I was terrified by this text my freshman year in college. Unfortunately, this book was the only required book for the class. The main difficulty is that the book resembles a magnificent outline of the material more than a text. The shortest, most elegant proof of anything is invariably choosen and there is little motivation given for the material. Thus, I found this book to be difficult to use to learn how to do mathematics. On the other side, if you know the basic ideas of analysis, then this book is a remarkable, clear, and elegant place to review and extend your knowledge. I therefore would HIGHLY recommend it as a companian text for an analysis course or as a reference. My rating therefore is an average: as an introduction to analysis by itself, it rates one star; as a supplement to another text, as a review text, or as a reference, it clearly rates five stars."
3,a good reference book,"This text is horrifying to learn from yet once you know the material (by way of another text), this is an excellent reference book. Also, it serves other purposes, mainly that of a door stop, paperweight, toilet paper, etc. If you're a masochist, go for it . . ."
3,"Great pens, but disappointed with packaging!","I was so excited to see that I could buy a box of just purple pens because I love Pentel RSVP pens. But I was extremely disappointed when it came in an Amazon box that was not even taped or glued together, which resulted in me not getting all 12 pens. One was lost in the shipping process which is unfortunate because I paid for 12 pens, not 11."
2,comfortable but unreliable,"I bought a pack of of Pentel R.S.V.P. pens a few months ago, and have since thrown them all away. The pens are comfortable, and they hold well in a shirt pocket. However, the ink does not come out smoothly, and it tends to be very light colored."
4,Great pens but..,For some reason the blue ones aren't as smooth as the purple ones. They leave little dark blotches in certain spots in words as though too much ink came out in one moment. I love the pens but the blue ones definitely weren't as good!
3,A lefty doesn't like this pen,"I was expecting something extraordinary from this pen because of its really good reviews, but it's just an ordinary pen. Nothing too amazingly smooth or comfortable, in my opinion. It might be even a bit uncomfortable if you are left-handed, depending on how you hold your pen. The ink wouldn't flow that smoothly for me with all of the pens in the box, and required some pressure."
3,10 out of 12 pens,"There were only 10 pens in this ""12 pack"". I guess that's one way to raise your profit margin. My wife uses the pens and likes them. Just feel a little cheated."
3,"Love the pen, hate the end","Pen itself works great, the ends (not the caps) crack and then fall out. I have just started gluing the ends to the pen. But I still like them."
1,Oh my,"I should have known better when I saw the demented oompa loompa staring up from the piano on the cover, but I do loves me some love songs.I'm not sure if I can ever listen to these classics again without a twinge of pain. Remember the episode of the Brady Bunch where Peter's voice was starting to change? This sounded sort of like that, somehow the Brady's figured out a way to make it work, but this singer has not, and since I would assume he's already gone through puberty, this could be a problem for him in his music career.And when Meade Skelton is thinking of his Nicole Kidman song in the shower, I doubt that he's singing, more like planning how he will kidnap her and go all Silence Of The Lambs on her, ""Nicole Rubs the lotion on it's skin and puts it back in the basket."""
5,Funny book and funny dvd.,"Both the book and the subsequent dvd appealed to my sense of humor. The writer tells exactly how it was for 18 year old kids, who were conscripted to serve 2 years in the British Armed Forces."
2,Poor picture quality,My girlfriend and I have used this camera for over a year now and no matter how many setting adjustments we've made the picture never comes out right. Our problem is not with the shutter speed or the flash speed its the overall color quality of the photos. The people in our pictures are always way too dark or way too white. Only decent pictures are ones taken on sunny days. Don't bother using the camera inside or on overcast days because you'll just end up dissapointed. We're not proffessional photographers by any means but after messing around with this thing for over a year we've decided its the camera that stinks not the users. Don't waste your money.
2,cheap!,"The shudder speed is terrible with this camera. Don't expect to take pictures of any events or activities. The only pictures that come out are ""static"" shots where nothing moves.You get what you pay for! Keep shopping! Don't buy!"
2,Not Dolph's fault,"I read some where that Dolph had said something along the lines that they had run out of money and had only half a day or so to film the martial art scenes for the movie. Its hard to criticise Dolph for this one. The script is not very good to start with and Dolph is given very little to try and work with. The second half of this movie which suffers from badly staged action pieces, does not live up to the well staged and enjoyable first half. The plot is an obvious Under Siege rip-off. This one is watchable but Dolph has done better before and in later movies after this one. A better script and more attention to the action set pieces and this could of been a winner."
2,A BIG disappointment,I have read other of McCrumb's book that I have loved-but this I meerly wanted to finish so I could find out the not exciting ending and get it over with! This just didn't strike me the same way as her others.
1,Uninteresting trivia,"As a descendant of Francis Stewart-Silver (Frankie Silver) I thought this book would be of some interest to me. What the story of Frankie Silver had to do with the fictional account of ""Fate Harkryder"", I have no idea. Such convolution in writing! After many tries, I finally reached the end of the book only to be left with confusion as to what it was all about."
1,I can't believe people liked this book,"Maybe I was deceived by the blurb on the audio edition, but I thought this would be an exciting police procedural. I didn't realize that it would be a long-winded repetitive telling of an old story with scant attention given to the modern-day crimes and no police work at all. Ms. McCrumb seems to believe that 19th-century writers are able to fill a lot of space because they said the same thing again and again and again. How many times did we have to hear about how Frankie probably killed her husband? Maybe four. Then switch to the present, and the sheriff goes all over it again! How much of this can one listener take?"
2,"In all her research, she lost the heart of the story.","Sharyn McCrumb spent four years of her life researching this novel and, By Jimney, she's gonna let you know it! I understand her reasoning for droning on and on about the family networks; the legal system then was the Old Boy Network to the extreme. Got it. The first time. Why did she have to keep hammering the same old nail? And what was with the Fleming/Waightstill sypnosis? Oh, oh, I get it...the rich don't hang. Okay, got it. Can we move on now? I was supremely disappointed with this novel. I feel if she had stayed on one story or the other, Silver's or Harkryder's (And don't even get me started on that redherring Trail Murders thing. I hate being teased.), it would've made a more entertaining and meaningful story. And that is what was missing from this whole, long charade: the heart of the story. She broke a cardinal rule of storytelling: she told us a story but did not show."
1,Dead out of the box - 5 years old,"Amazon is selling very old stock as new. I installed the mounting bracket on the wall, broke off the required tab and then discovered the alarm was dead out of the box, you can't replace the battery if you wanted to. I then noticed that it was dated July 11, 2005. I threw it away since I had already discarded the boxes and packing, and sending it back was going to be more trouble than it was worth. I will be very careful about ordering anything from Amazon again. I read the reviews and see that someone else had the same problem and they keep selling their old dead stock anyway.First Alert SA10YRCL 10-Year Lithium Power Smoke Detector"
5,Great Shoes,"Love these shoes/sandals. Comfortable from the moment you put them on. They can be worn on almost all terrains,are very durable and provide a lot of support. I own 3 pairs so far."
5,Amazing Sandals!,"These sandals are very comfortable and are great for walking. I usually wear size 7-1/2 or 8, and the 8 fits fine. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a waterproof sandal."
5,"Love, love, love these shoes!","Bought these Keens on sale for an excellent price, just before going on a cruise to the Southern Caribbean. They fit so comfortably, and dried quickly when they got wet. I didn't experience any of the problems other described regarding discoloring of feet, etc. May have been the particular color I purchased. No blisters caused by these shoes at all, and they worked well for ziplining, which required closed toe shoes. Have never had Keens before, and saw them recommended on CruiseCritic by several regarding shoes that do well when climbing rocks around waterfalls, etc. They have lots of grip and are not bad looking for athletic shoes! Couldn't be happier."
2,Love shoe hate black toes,Thank you for replacing my first pair of Vensie H2. Unfortunately thesecond pair also turns my toes black. The fabric lining to toe cup isNOT colorfast. Everytime I wear them they turn my toes black and the black does NOT wash off in the shower. This is a major problem. Carol Wissolik
4,Very helpful,"This book was very helpful, I have enjoyed going through it and being able to find out all of the changes that the baby is going through every week, it's also explains what you should be thinking about in a timely fashion and what to expect at doctors appointments. Very helpful for this first time parent."
4,Covers The Basics,"A decent general pregnancy book (much better than What To Expect When You're Expecting.) I liked the photos and the open way different aspects are discussed. I do wish that instead of several weeks at a time being discussed, that the individual weeks would have been discussed seperately. If you are expecting, check out a beautiful motherhood pendant at www.lifemedals.com/mothernecklace - I love mine!"
1,pay extra for the same thing,"If you bought or planning to buy your immortal brain, don't get this one, basically the same thing word for word and on top of it a very poor audio quality, better to just get the DVD ""your immortal brain"", to bad Amazon offers them as a dual buy, waste of your good money."
3,"Vol.20: Mythological Creatures, the Great Outdoors, etc.","Gerald Donelan has 15 cartoons this Volume, including both color covers! Other highlights: ""Coley: Bayou Boy"" by John Blackburn, in which the blonde voodoo boy has fun with a guy he meets in a riverfront bar (at least, until they're interrupted); ""Mythology Revisited"" by The Hun, wherein he experiments with fully-rendered graytone art; ""Big Lay Down The Highway"" by Farraday, a fun tale about truckers shot from pencilled art (I just wish this guy would take some DRAWING classes!); ""A Wedding In The Family"" by Kurt Erichsen, a comedy involving a guy trying to deal with a possessive mother; and ""Dune Buggers"" by Sean, in which a guy celebrates his birthday outdoors in the wild-- with a wild pack of friends!"
4,Good stuff,Tastes good. Good for you. None of the bad stuff. Good hydration. I always keep some on hand. My 7 year old drinks it often.
2,Shameless cash in attempt from Spitfire,"With guitarist extraordinaire Zakk Wylde's Black Label Society departing with Spitfire Records, let the cash in begin. ""Kings of Damnation"" is nothing more than a shameless cash in attempt, with two new songs (""Doomsday Inc."" and ""SDMF"", both of which are killer) thrown on to attract longtime fans. The BLS songs you would expect to be here are here: ""Bored to Tears"", ""Bleed For Me"", ""Counterfeit God"", ""We Live No More"", ""Stillborn"", and ""House of Doom"", but there are other amazing songs that are not here, such as ""Hey You (Batch of Lies)"", ""Just Killing Time"", ""Damage is Done"", ""Layne"", and even Zakk's take on ""No More Tears"". This compilation is completely worthless for BLS fans who already own every album, and while it may be a nice intoduction for new fans to the band, this is still better left on the shelf for everyone else."
2,A mirical working dj!,"Dont get me wrong, Dj Tiesto is the leading dj out there. With the most relaxing yet mind racing productions. But this is my least favorite cd he's put out. Possibly one or two tracks here that could exite you but if you want to catch a drift of what he's about I have some other suggestions for you. The entire trilogy of ISOS. It will take you through emotions you were un-aware of, and back."
5,Space opera with a sharp cynic flavor,"A rare gem of a book. The hooded Swan series has it all-interesting aliens, weird beliefs, ruthless space corporations, and a sharp, wry humour, A masterpiece in Space Opera!"
4,The best chart format in all HOT 100 history,"Another bound volume of Billboard HOT 100 reproductions. It covers the period of weekly charts from January 6, 1990 to the christmas of 1999. As for the reproduction quality, this 90s book stands out among the other decades in its series (50s,60s,70s and 80s).For me personally, the design for HOT 100 charts has found its best format yet. Better than their preceeding designs.I just wonder why this chart book series all come in different sizes / dimensions. I just wish the series could stack up neatly in my book shelf."
2,Not satisfied with purchase,I got these for a custom les paul 5 string bass I had built and one of the locks broke off after a month and a couple of uses. Also the locks were quite uncomfortable to use. I had never used strap locks before and don't think I will again.
4,Put on G&L ASAT,"Great product. Well built. Screws do not fit right on G&L ASAT. You have to use original screws, which do not fit through the brass hole on the mount. I used my dremel to bore out the hole slightly and the screw now fits and secures the mount to the guitar. Hope this helps anyone else who wants this product on their G&L."
2,Schaller vs. Dunlop strap locks,"I just wrote a similar review for the Dunlop Straploks. The Schallers are prone to loosening and coming apart, the Dunlops are not. If you keep on top of the Schallers and make sure that the nut on the strap is always tight, they're fine. But I've had them come apart on me several times, and I don't trust them anymore. I check them regularly, and I could put thread locker on the nuts, which will help, but I'm eventually going to replace all of my Schallers with Dunlops. In my view the Dunlop is a superior design."
4,nice thermos,does exactly what I want it to do. keeps my coffee warm in the morning while I ride to work.
5,Great insulation,This isn't the first Thermos Nissan product I've enjoyed. The double walled vacuum is flawless. I keep this one in the freezer and fill it with a few cubes and water when I'm going to need a cool drink available at meetings and drives - and I stays icy cold all day.
2,It Leaked!,"The first time I used it, it worked great. My son's chocolate milk stayed very cold. The next day, the chocolate milk was all over my bag. It had leaked out of the the lid where it screws on. My husband said the gasket must be faulty. Very disappointing after only one use! This had potential."
3,okay....okay,"seems to work fine, and I'm happy with the purchase... Dave the buyer and it says I need 7 more words. okay"
3,"Pretty good thermos, but not hot enough. Miss my old Nissan!","I thought I could replace my old Nissan with this new Thermos, but no. It holds my coffee, but only in a lukewarm-plus state. (Yes, I preheat the container with boiling water). My old Nissan: that thing was a champ. Truly kept the coffee hot for quite a while. I also dislike the spot on this. You can drink it on the go, yes, but only by wrapping your mouth around the spout: a bit like sucking coffee out of a huge straw. Looks ridiculous too. The Nissan flip lid had a fairly nice sipper for use during in the car, on public transit, or otherwise in public. For all who like their liquids very hot, I'd pass on this one and go straight for the REAL Nissan (Thermos Nissan JMW500P6 16-Ounce Stainless-Steel Backpack Bottle, Silver)."
5,Excellent product,"Excellent product was tested on a very cold water for 12 hours, and the same degree of cold has not changed"
2,sprung a leak,"I bought this for my wife about six months ago. Three months ago, the gasket in the screw top came out. The first few times it went back in with no problem, but now it won't stay seated properly, so the thermos leaks."
3,Nice but does not hold heat well,"This is an attractive juicer. Bought it for a friend, especially for usewhen her older mother visits. However, despite the looks, it doesnot keep the liquid hot for any period of time. This is my caution."
3,seal falls out of cap,"This is a great Thermos .. for a few weeks... then the ring seal will fall out of the cap, and might get lost (I haven't found mine yet) The seal between the cap and the stainless bottle is set in the cap without any retaining mechanism .. except, perhaps glue? .. It will come loose in time, and fall out of the cap. If you don't see that happen, the next time you use the bottle, it will dribble all over you. I have only used it with water & some ice ... never washed it, just rinsed it out. It was made in China, unlike other Thermos bottles, so that might be a factor. I've emailed Thermos to see if I can get another ring seal .. in the meantime, I'm ordering another bottle from Amazon... and will keep an eye on the seal status .. now that I know what to watch for .. so, if you buy one, always check to see if the seal is still in the cap ... and you will be happy with this product."
5,Best thermos ever!,"This is the best thermos you could ever buy. It fits into any auto cup holder, it keeps things cold or hot for about 10 to 12 hours, there is never any drips or spills due to it's amazing drink spout, and it is excellent quality something you do not find easily today! I can't say enough about this thermos, we ordered these from amazon.com after having purchased 2 at a sporting goods store previously for a much higher price. Thank you Amazon!"
5,Great Bottle,Use it every day. It has help me to save a ton by not buying bottled water to take to water. Keeps my beverages cool all day.
3,It has major design flaws.,"After about a year of using, it finally started to leak even when I twisted the cap to the tightest point, so I should have listened to some of the reviewers who had the same problem.It is good bottle until it leaks. It generally does what it supposed to in term of thermo. It keeps the drink hot or cold for hours. it is sturdy too. I dropped it few times, but apparetly the bottle is with only one small dent at the bottom. It is easy to clean, but the rubber pieces attached on the cap might come off without you even noticing it, especially after you clean the cap with some sort of brush many times.Get other type of thermos if you want use it for long time. Something will go wrong at the cap sooner or later because of its design flaw."
2,Stainless thermos,"I loved this product, it keeps my coffee hot for several hours, but now about four months of daily use the plastic on the top is allowing spillage. Now I end up burning and spilling my hot coffee on myself daily. Back looking for another thermos."
1,Doesn't keep it hot!!!,"Boiled water after few hours is not even warm! I never used it for cold beverages, but it certainly is not for keeping hot beverages!"
4,Good Product...Not Great,"I bought this product in mid June 2012. I use this water bottle all day each day, refilling at lest 3-4 times. I have been using for over 6 months. The lid works great. I has withstood several drops, so don't let the plastic top worry you. It keeps water cool for several hours out of the tap. If there is ice in the bottle, it will keep something cold for over 12 hours easily.I do have two complaints. The first is the o-ring inside the screw on portion of the top. It has split and if it pops loose when refilling, water will leak. I did not have this problem until after 6 months of use. I have searched for a replacement o-ring but have been unable to find one. The second complaint is minor. The outer grip can slid up or down at times and needs to be re-positioned. This is just a minor annoyance.All in all, I would recommend this product. If a replacement o-ring was available at a low price, I would consider this a 5 star item."
4,not for hot liquids,I was disappointed that this Thermos product is not for hot liquids. This was not mentioned in the descrption. The reason is because it is hard to drink out of the spout without scalding yourself. I still drink coffee out of it. Just make sure it is not too hot. This bottle will keep liquid at the same temperature for hours.
1,False advertising?,"I purchased this product with the hope of sipping my hot tea from it while being able to hold the metal casing without burning my hands.. This product only could accomplish one of the two goals... kept my hands cool with hot liquid inside. There was no way that I could drink from it.. and the note inside of the thermos said, do not drink directly from it.. all that equals no use for me."
5,Great Thermos,"I bought this thermos to use in our motorhome while traveling. It fits the cup hold prefectly and doesn't tip over on bumps or curves! I fill it with 4 ice cubes and a can of soda, it keeps the soda cold for over 10 hours as I drink it down. Great Thermos"
4,Great Water Bottle,"I am a huge fan of both this and the straw version of this water bottle. It keeps thing cold for a long time and holds a decent amount of water while still feeling very portable. My one and only complaint is that sometimes I like to just chug the water. That is the reason I got this over the straw version. However, the opening doesn't allow the water to flow as freely as I would like."
5,Excelent thermos!,The best thermos I ever used! It keeps everything cold for many hours! And very comfortable in using. The best product in this category . Highly recommend to everyone.
4,Bill Tapply remembered,A good read and fond remembrance of Bill Tapply. Specific instructions for success at this type of fly fishing and fly tying.
3,Be Aware of What's Not on the CD,"I purchased Free to Be You and Me for my grandchildren for Christmas. The new edition of the book looks very good. In the write-up it indicated that there was a CD included. I, of course, thought that it was the CD with all the songs that are in the book. It was one of the reasons that I was buying it. That was a wrong assumption.The CD that comes with the book has only four songs and I was very disappointed when it arrived. I had to find and buy the CD with all of the songs. I wrote to Amazon and told them that I thought that this was deceptive in the description and asked that they let buyers know that the CD that is included is not the original soundtrack. Just be aware that you will need to buy another CD if you want all of the songs that go with the book."
1,Website Animal Site Maker Pro is useless,I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this product.It is not what I assumed it would be. Linking only to the website of Site Maker Pro is useless.I could have joined my Chamber of Commerce and linked to their site with a much larger viewing audience.I am new to web site building and have learned my lessonat a cost.
5,My Review,"I greatly appreciate products like this that don't waste space on my bookshelf. Wish they were priced more reasonably, I would buy many more if they were."
3,a short review,"The authors of this book, Daniel Ali and Robert Spencer, are both members of the Christian-Islamic Forum, a group dedicated to spreading Christianity among Muslims. What you will find in the book is a Catholic critique of Islam, Mohammad and the Koran.Those reading it should understand before they start, that the authors are true to their own faith. The implication is that while they endlessly attack and question Islam, they treat their own Catholic Christian religious beliefs as being revealed truth. The book sets out to show that Islam is a false, dishonest religion and provides an extensive list of misquoted sources to back up its case.Its a good book if you are a Catholic who wants to know from a Catholic perspective why Islam is false as a religion and Catholicism is the only true Christianity. For others, its not going to be very useful.I gave it three stars because its the most honest of the books on Islam Mr. Spencer has been associated with in terms of his agenda."
1,"Ummmm, no","Sorry, this is just plain bad. Yeah they make some interesting music at times with some different time signature changes and melodies such as on ""****ing's Greatest Hits"" , but this album is so just redundant to the point where one or two songs are enough for you to say ""yeah, I get it,"" and then just move along. And the vocals are just too intolerable after a few minutes of unintelligle whining/screaming."
2,Esoteric failure,"The Bottom Line:A spoof film about such a limited subset of a genre (early 80s summer camp movies) that there are probably about three people in the world who get all the jokes, Wet Hot American Summer has acquired a bit of a cult following but it unfortunately won't appeal to most people; unless you've seen Meatballs a hundred times you're likely to spend the majority of this film waiting for the laughs that never come.2/4"
4,"Starts out normal, then really gets weird",This is one of the strangest and funniest movies I've seen in a long long time. It is a parody of 70s and 80s summer camp movies but it doesn't feel like a parody in the beginning. The first 20 minutes or so feel exactly like the movies it's parodying with a few odd subtleties. Then suddenly the movie switches into spoof mode with some of the funniest and most bizarre scenes I've ever seen.The town scene alone is worth the price of admission.
2,What a waste of talent.,"After seeing ""Role Models"" I opted to check out David Wain's(director) earlier work. Great cast but what is this supposed to be? A parody? I mean really, WTF? It's just not funny! Maybe a couple laughs but there's no continuity, no story, it goes nowhere. They did accomplish making it look like a 1981 movie (the year it is supposed to be set in) but whoever edited this thing should find another line of work. What a waste of great talent too. The deleted scenes on the DVD were more entertaining than the whole movie."
3,A good corny movie,"I just watched 'Wet Hot American Summer' and liked it. It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but it was funny. I had a good laugh. If you don't like corny humor though, you probably will not enjoy this movie. Filled with silly jokes and weird scenes that don't make sense, but that pay homage to 70s-80s summer camp movies, 'Wet Hot American Summer' is a pretty good movie. It features a lot of great actors."
1,Are these reviewers on the payroll?,"I bought this movie based on the reviews it recieved on Amazon - one reviewer even went so far as to say that it was the best comedy ever made! This was, bar none, the worst movie I've seen in 5 years. I don't think I laughed even once. These reviewers are either insane, high on crack, or (most likely) involved with the production/distribution of this movie."
1,A failed attempt at humor,"I bought this DVD based on the reviews; unfortunately, it was a big mistake. While two of my favorite actors were in this movie, the humor failed to make me laugh. It was worse than childish and I got only a couple of chuckles from the movie. I would not watch it again and I would not recommend it to anyone. Be afraid, be very afraid---you have been warned."
1,"One Wet, Un-Hot, Non-American, Summer Bummer","Wet Hot American Summer which was dilmed in Honesdale, Pa which is right next to where I live, hawley, Pa, was horrible. I had been waiting all summer to see it because my cousin was the water skier that drowns. But this movie just stunk. The actors performances were weak and completely corny. The extras that were from Honesdale did a horrible job talking and acting. The one kid couldn't even run through the woods. They also have a very violent drug scene which was so dumb its beyond imagination. The movie had some funny parts but nothing to have a belly laugh over. I also dont understand way critics form Entertainment Weekley gave it a A. It doesn't even deserve an F!!! So don't go and waste your hard earned cash on this summer bummer. Go out and rent a movie that at least has one good actor in it."
1,"Infomercial Quality, Brainless Copy And Paste Job!","This text does not deserve a long review. Here are my main reasons:(1) The content is a result of badly organized copy and paste process from the first author's research group with major errors.(2) Even the author diversity visible in various chapters does not add value, I believe the second and third authors are Paulraj drones. There is not one good chapter that I can recommend someone to read.(3) Branka Vucetic et.al.'s book is a much better organized one although it suffers from the cut and paste process.Recommendation: AVOID! Do not buy this self referencing piece of crap, and give the trees a chance to grow.There are many good tutorial and seminal articles on space-time wireless communications and coding. This book does not even do a good job on these references. [...]"
1,STAY AWAY FROM ALL IOMEGA,"This NAS 150d arrived dead out of the box. Iomega made me pay the shipping for a replacement. The replacement was scratched up, had no key, and was shipped loose in a box. Iomega did not want to replace that either! What a terrible, terrible company!!"
5,ok hunting gun,i got this gun 2 months ago in that yime i went hunting ang its a good gun but u have to hit it in the right spot so the most hunting u will do with it is if u hunt birds or rabits or maybe something bigger but all for all its good if u have alot os money like me (ps. im 14)
1,False Advertising,"I don't hate the product. I love the product. However, I ordered what was pictured, which was the regular size, along with the travel size. It did not come this way. I only received the regular size. This is definitely false advertising and misleading. do not order from this company. I know I never will again. Shame!"
4,another great reference,A good companion book for volume #1. I especially liked the appliqué and color section.
2,Nora,"After waiting eagerly for this book all I can say is... disappointing. VERY disappointing! The 2 stars are for the 'appliques' section. Everything else in Epstein's book goes from ridiculous to LUDICROUS! The 'nouveau' section, 'cozy coat with fur ball trim' and the 'circus circle scarf' are beyond words... apart from 'WHY???' Without wishing to sound harsh, the only place for this book is in the bin!PS Epstein's first book, the beautiful 'Knitting on the egde"" was the motivation behind this purchase."
4,creative,Great ideas if you like to create your own borders and edges on sweaters. Something a intermediate or beyond knitter can use. I also have her first book on edges and will plan to buy or new book.
3,i do like the series,Although I have not read the book yet but I did flip through it and i was diappionted.There were parts with Lisa besides a phone call and a letter.I thought that they would encluded Lisa in it but they didnt.
4,It was good but differant!,I really enjoyed Pine Hollow but what about Veronica! And The Saddle club didn't seem as horse crazy as they were. I liked the book but gave it 4 stars because of it being so differant than the saddle club........
5,Super fizzy and tasty,"This candy is exactly how I remember it. The flavors are not overpowering, and the fizz in each one is fantastic."
2,Not what I'd hoped,"The subtitle ""The Complusion to Build"" was what attracted me to the book after first learning about it in another Chelsea Green publication. I hoped for insightful wisdom about one's motivation to build things out of wood using traditional methods like timberframe. And there are some nice parts about the use of old tools, especially one section where he describes visiting a used tool shop in Maine. But I was dissatisfied with the book because of the constant digressions about the ""local yokels."" I wasn't interested in reading character studies of a misfit Vet, two junkyard owners, the local Amish families, and assorted others who populate this corner of upstate NY. I was hoping for deeper ruminations about craftsmanship, along the lines of ""Grain of Truth: The Ancient Lessons of Craft"" by Ross Laird. [That book was better than this one but at the time I didn't like it much either -- see my review about it.] Oh well. At least it was a quick read due to the extremely short chapters."
5,A Forgotten Gem!,"This recording made several years ago will wear out your CD player! Jazz legend Stan Getz accompanies Cybill's great voice! She is strong and powerful on all the tracks!My favorite is ""Mad About The Boy"" In fact I am mad about this gal! A must for all Cybill fans!"
3,Man of Steel sinks in this games,"I am an avid Superman fan. So when I finally came around to playing the game, I am excited to see how years of Technological growth translate my favorite superhero. As some have mentioned, the game starts off incredibly strong. While the effects and background weren't Da Vinci, it actually felt and looked like a city. And the flying around like Superman was amazing. I give the producers credit, every detail about Supe's flight (sound, ground shattering, breaking the sound barrier) added to the overall experience. And then the game continues, and it becomes incredibly repetitive and tedious. The city's damage becomes the Man of Steel's health bar. Great! But there are so many fires breaking out everywhere you wonder if this Metropolis was made of cardboard. The improvements on past Superman games are welcomed, but the stories still need help taking off."
3,Not great...but ok,"Sure this isn't the best Superman game ever made,but it isn't the worst either.If you wanna talk about a bad Superman game,then talk about that god awful game ""Superman 64"".""Superman Returns"" is a 100 x better than that crap was.The missions in here can be kinda tough,but the best part of the game is flying around the city.Thats what I enjoyed most about it.The graphics are pretty good.Not outstanding or anything..but still good.Overall,if you are a fan od DC and/or Superman,I would recommend that you at least try this game before judging it."
2,No way!!,"If you're not a Firehouse fan and buy this album, you'll be angry.If you're a Firehouse fan, you'll be disappointed.That's it."
5,Domo Arigato From A Japanese Fan,Firehouse is one of the greatest rock bands of the world. What I like about them is they keep true to their style no matter what rock style dominates the charts. Japanese rock fans really loved them and supported them while the band they love was neglected in the U.S.Opening track Jumpin' litarally get you jumpin' it is great fun pop rock. Boys want to rock it really hard don't they? Don't Fade On Me is a great ballad with solid guitar riff. Unbelievable and Loving You Is Paradise show their pop rock appeal. Japanese fans look farward to their return to mainstream. And I'm sure they will.
4,Great Album,"The album is one of my favorites. I compare it to like a loose mogwai and kinda in the vein of godspeed you black emperor, only I think it survived the death of that slow swelling post-rock genre. It's great on so many levels, for one it's more of a grouping of several songs which are largely experiments with loose song structure and uncommon instrument arrangements/sampling, save a few of the more concrete songs. How Animals Move (and the solo violin version) being one of the more concrete songs, is an amazing and well composed swelling/emotional/moving song. The low fi recording style/sound is very interesting and amazing in itself (over-reverbed violin solo song and sampling on several songs). This is a very unconventional album and definitely worth a listen!"
1,Tony Takitani,"Based on the trailers and reviews I thought this would be a great vidio. Wrong this movie is so boring I regret every minute I watched it. I got it for my mother, who's Japanese, and she is even more diapointed in the movie than I am."
2,slingshot ball,"I saw an advertisement where it looked like the ball was being flung real far across a lake, which is why I bought it. I wanted to be able to throw the ball further, but the way the you have to hold the sling shot and the way the rubber rope is so stiff, the ball never went far at all. You need to have very strong arms to be able to get the ball to even go even a decent distance. Even my husband tried it and he got it to go a little bit further, but we could both get the ball to go much further with the Chuck it ball flinger. I am not the best ball thrower, but I can throw the ball further than this slingshot thing can. My dogs do like to run around with the ball in their mouth and flap the rubber rope around. The ball is not very durable either as it had chunks missing off of it right away. It is not worth the price I paid for this product. I would not recommend it!"
4,A sad but good book,"I thought this book was so sad. Mary Anne loses everything- only a few things survied. Mary Anne is woke up in the middle of the night by her cat Tigger. She didn't even cry about it. Finally at the very end, she decides to cry. I would have to say, if you are like Mary Anne, and you cry allot. Don't read this book."
4,"Sad, but not that sad","Well, it was realistic and unrealistic in a few ways - the emotions of the characters, I mean. It's sad (but still funny in a few parts), and yet not everyone is as heartbroken as MaryAnne is... maybe it's common.I'm sure that the title explains what's going on in this story, in a way, so I'll just say that my favourite part is when MaryAnne cries for the first time since the fire. I hope this was a useful review..."
3,Reminds me of a textbook,"It has some interesting points in relation to time, some, I found very interesting. Overall it is well explained. What did surprise me is for a book written in the 1950s how current the information was, have to really learnt so little about this subject in 50 years?Warning if you are not into mathematics, do not take this book as it is full of it."
4,Disney does it again!,"I haven't purchased this item yet but I have experienced the songs on it, and if you know disney then you know a great soundtrack. I especially like the tracks ""digga digga dog"" and ""whatcha gonna do (with your second chance)"". It's a great album for your family, kids will enjoy it! A very cute album to have and I think you might enjoy it too!"
5,Absolutely spellbinding by an excellent writer,A hard to put down classic book by a great writer who certainly did his homework.... Kennedy's so called bright bunch along with a narrow focused McNamara and the military morons in the Pentagon. For those interested in accurate history of how we screwed up in Vietnam (and doing it all over again) a must read.
4,he teaches a bit more....,"I went to his seminars about Zhan Zhuang. in the book the moves are given in very good detail. there is only one missing point, as other Chinese teachers, he did not put some moves in to the book. still one of the best book about..."
5,Super Crazy Umbrella Oh Yeah,"This thing is the most amazing product, because it was raining like mad, then i got this because hey, a dude needs an umbrella if it's raining, right? So i got this, and it made all the rain disappear for half a year! I think we might have gone into a minor drought! The ECOSYSTEM IS AFRAID OF THIS THING, THAT'S HOW AWESOME IT IS."
1,Lousy Workmanship,"10,000 B.C.The DVD was of the poorest quality I have run across. As the movie would play, the screen would freeze and not run at all. Fast forwarding only took you to the next motion freeze. The freezes were consistant on both the wide screen and whole screen sides. I would not recommend this particular DVD to anyone intending to actually watch the movie."
4,"Hey, it's a fun movie, really.","I just love to tag the idiots who think they're so smooth panning a movie because they're above it all. Get a life! If you wrote a review you must have seen, or heard others comment. It was good, clean fun, not action packed idiocy throughout - some just don't get that. The film is reminiscent of Gibsons 'Apocalypto', not much acting, but a story line that wasn't lost in the telling, and an ending worthy of good fantasy - three and a half stars."
2,It may be Ok to watch once.,Slow-paced and unsophisticated. There is no much of a story or character interaction.It will probably hold your attention long enough to see it all once.
1,Childish? Unprofessional? Lazy? This movie is bad.,"I can't even get past the terrible speech. These ""cave men"" spoke English with an accent? That killed it right from the beginning. Throw in weird ostrich dinosaurs, terrible cgi graphics, horrible acting, an awful story, and you have one terrible movie."
4,Its worth 15 bucks,"Obviously its not the greatest movie even written, but c'mon! Did you really expect it to be!?! In Blu-ray this film looks amazing, the plot is a fun little fantasy that i really enjoy watching from time to time. I'm not expecting Oscar-worthy performances, but its by no means ""Gigli"" caliber acting either. Its just a fun movie with great cinematography. Again, its worth 15 bucks, or look at it this way. For the same price of this movie you can get your family dinner at a fast food restaurant. I'd rather buy this movie."
3,Reminded Me Of Stargate,"Not what I expected. Looked more like ""Stargate"" (Kurt Russell)than a prehistoric caveman movie.Unfortunately, not as entertaining as ""Stargate"". And not asentertaining as prehistoric movies like ""Qwest For Fire"" or""Clan Of The Cavebear"".3 stars may be a little generous for this dud, but you haveto give some credit for the scenery and special effects.--"
3,Adventure fantasy that's not bad,"Wow, some of the reviews label this a real stinker. Give it a break. It's not prehistoric history; it's not a geography lesson; it's an adventure, pure and simple. It reminds me of an E.R. Burrough's tale: good vs. evil, a noble quest to save one's princess, lots of fighting and surreal surroundings, monstrous animals, and a little romance.The main actors deliver for the genre: Steven Strait- muscular, ruggedly handsome, angst; Camilla Belle- beautiful, wistful, longing, angst. The evil guys evil.The downers: the story's a bit hokey and, of course, it's predictable. And the romance could be richer. But there's no foul language, no sex, and the violence, stylized; moreover, the scenery's incredible, and there's plenty of computerized images to stir the imagination, most of it's well done. So, it's not 'Lord of the Rings', but I'd love to make friends with a mammoth or sabertooth anytime."
1,Really really bad. Dont waste your time or money,I was so excited to see this film and I had to watch it all the way through only because I was so shocked at how bad it was that I was certain it would turn a corner. It didnt.
2,it was a weird but interesting movie,it was a very strange movie . it was too long and kinda got annoying but at the same time i couldnt stop watching it. it was terribly long but my eyes were glued 2 the screen. my advice is dont watch this movie unless your xtremely bored
5,great movie,"I NEVER REALLY LIKED THESE KINDS OF MOVIES, BUT THIS ONE IS NOW IN MY COLLECTION OF DVD'S. I FIRST SAW PATS OF IT AT A FRIENDS HOUSE AND I LIKE WHAT I SAW, AFTER BUYING IT HERE AND WATCHING IT THROUGH I LOVED IT, FULL OF EVERYTHING MOVIE LOVERS LOOK FOR IN A MOVIE, GIVE IT A TRY I DON'T THINK YOU'LL BE LET DOWN."
3,A Modern Tarzan Movie,"This movie was pure nonthinking entertainment. No PC-ness. Just a movie.I would watch this movie before I'd watch one that won an Academy Award.If you liked the cheesey, old, black and white Tazan movies and are willing to check your brain at the door, this movie is for you.If you expect nothing you will be pleasantly surprized.The CG are very good and don't overwelm the plot.The best CG scenes are in the trailer.The trailer doesn't represent the actual (simple) plot.All and all, is was good for a night of entertainment. Don't invite your snooty, wine-drinking friends over to watch this movie.Watch this movie with your 10 - 14 year old boys. They will love it.There were monsters and violence but no gore.No sex, No nudity.The plot was extremely simple. But it's just entertainment."
4,Origin of the myth of young love,"Fundamentally, this is a story about a myth's being made. It is easy to forget that it is a story within a story. If that memory is lost during the movie, the ending may seem contrived. If that memory is retained, the viewer will realize that the story develops the process of myth construction common to virtually all cultures and suggests the reason that myths are a necessary part of a culture. The characters are well acted, and the set was very realistic. The pace of the story might seem slow to people oriented to movies with a new car wreck or gun fight every five seconds. Nevertheless, the pacing fits the story, and this script simply doesn't lend itself to a shoot-em-up. In many respects, this film has classic properties."
2,NO,"This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was unrealistic, but not in like an enslaved co-operative mammoths kond of way kind of way, like a a tiger would never live nearly drowning in a pit full of giant man-eating birds for god knows how long kind of way. And the story line was horrible and in some parts you were left wondering if there was a storyline because you had lost track. Then when it ended you had so many questions and were left hungry for more. the one thing i will say about this is that the action scenes were good a fairly well directed. But other than that this movie sucked it is a waste of time."
3,Interesting Adventure,"This was definately interesting as far as a ""caveman"" movie is concerned. It doesn't focus at all on the life of a cave person like Quest for Fire or Clan of the Cave Bear, but instead focuses on a man from a mountain, mammoth hunting tribe going off on an adventure to rescue his love from a people who stole her, and others, to do with them who knows what.The cover is misleading because the interaction between him and the tiger was surprisingly little.The ending to the movie is what makes this into a fantasy over having any historical value. I never expected pyramids to be anywhere near. I was sort of wondering why the writer wanted to end it that way.The movie does have a good message. It's about finding out who you are, learing to face fears and determination can win out against adversity. Of course we've seen movies that have dealt with these themes before, and better, but this movie is a nice escape for an hour or two."
3,Worth watching for the special effects,"Anyone whose enjoyment depends on historical or scientific accuracy, or a convincing plot, will find this a maddening film. I enjoyed it purely for the wonderful recreations of prehistoric beasts (real or imagined) -- in that one category it does accomplish movie magic, making one feel the scale and presence of these extinct and magnificent giants. The scenery is spectacular as well."
4,An excellent thriller. Good material. Page turner.,"This novel is a rare find. Worth the money. A suspense-and-thrill ride throughout. Not in the same league as Clancy and company. Better. The characters are as authentic as they get in real life in today's war on terrorism, Washington bureaucracy, and cyber world; the events as close as seeing 9/11 happen over again."
3,Book cover,"The book is to be a Christmas gift for my wife. When I received it my first thought was it was used because the book cover sleeve had a bunch of indented lines running over it, as if someone was drawing on a pioece of paper with the book as a hard surface. I emailed the company that sent it asking for a freash cover but nothing."
1,Glad I got it on sale...,"I had considered buying this from the Southwest Indian Foundation for a while, but saw it at an incredibly large discount here. I see why.If you live in the southwest and your diet includes a fair amount of roadkill and cactus, you might like this book. If you are looking for good recipes, get another book.Most ingredients are not easily found in a grocery store, and the cultural tidbits are scant at best."
4,"Definitive, complete. Would like a pocket version though!","The only thing I can find wrong with this guide is that I wish it were in a smaller form factor -- the large pages are colorful and bright, but the magazine format is a drag because it gets dog-eared quickly. A thicker, pocket-sized guide would be just the thing for this PORTABLE game, especially since most of the maps and charts don't take up a full 8.5 x 11 in page.Even better than that, of course, would be to have the reference material somehow hidden in the software. The built-in maps in the game are helpful, but not nearly as complete as these in the book."
2,missing bearing,"got the bearing on the tip but the other is not there? whats the deal?sent it back, but got the same thing again. what the....?"
3,It's a bass box,"That's about all I can say. I bought this to replace the very inefficient 10"" cheap-o 'Boss Sound' sub I had in a 1.0 cu ft enclosure, which sounded very loose and wooly - even when driven with a 300WRMS Rockford Fosgate amp on 8AWG cable.The Visonik makes bass and plenty of it. It's louder than the other sub I have. As one might expect, the sound is more wooly than a sealed enclosure, and it's not the sound I'm looking for. Too boomy for my little Ford Focus ZX3. Sounds OK on hip hop or dance type music but not good on rock, which is what I mostly listen to. What I think I need is a little 8"" bass tube.I tried both boxes together for a couple of weeks and kept switching between the two. Found that I preferred the sound of the box I already had, so will be selling the Visonik when I get round to it.One thing I noticed on this box - the speaker is connected to the rear terminals by what looks like a piece of bell wire!"
1,Poor customer service,"I ordered this set at a much higher price. When it arrived, I was moving to a new home and this would be our only breakfast table. When I openned the package, the pedestal was cracked in several places. One chair arm was also cracked. I had to put them together and hope they would hold until the company sent a replacement. The company (Visiondecor) was very slow to respond and required photos of the damage. I had to send the photos twice which caused more delay. They then wanted me to return the pedestal before they would send a replacement. No telling how long this would have taken. I tried to pay for a replacement and they would not consider this approach. Since time was dragging on, I gave up and paid a handyman to have the pedestal repaired (rebuilt). Don't count on customer service from this company!"
2,Did any Chinese learners actually read this before they published it?,"The dialogue in the book is reasonably interesting and challenging, but it really speaks poorly of the authors when they can't even bother to list all of the new vocabulary that gets used in the book. Granted, it's not part of a series, but by the 14th chapter, I had to look up no less than 30 words to understand 2 pages of dialog. I meticulously keep track of all vocabulary that I have ever learned and so it's impossible that I just forgot it. This really just gives students a lot of unnecessary frustration. I can understand you might miss a word here and there, but 30+???. Come on guys. Have a student read the thing before you publish it and mark all the words he had to look up, add those to the new word list. I seriously hope the problems are fixed in the 2nd edition of this book, but I doubt I'll bother ever reading it to find out."
2,This book needs lots of improvement!,"I've tried this book/cassettes and it's not a bad book, but it's just needs some improvement. First, it needs to be in PINYIN! All the texts are in chinese characters and not pinyin. Secondly, translation paralleling the text would be extremely helpful. It has none! Thirdly, the people who speak on the tapes are not trained in ""play-acting"". They just read but do not have a realistic dialogue between 2 Chinese. Better and clearer voices are needed to speak in the recording. I understand that the purpose of ""intermediate/advance"" book is for the student to look up words/vocabularies by themselves but since it is for self-study purpose it is so extremely time-consuming to do it by one-self."
1,Didn't like it,I used this product for about 2 weeks and was breaking out horribly during this time. I stopped using it and my face cleared up totally so I ended up throwing it in the trash so I wasted my money on this one :-(
4,Good product,"I like Ambi Skincare products, however they do take A LONG time to become effective. I had to use this for almost two months before i saw any results, in which is why i rated it 4 stars. I dont have acne, however it did clear up most the dark areas on my face"
2,weather station,Attractive and gives accurate temperature but worthless on other features. It shows sunny and bright in the worst storms and cloudy and raining on sunny days.
4,Gift purchase,"The LaCrosse technology WS-7014CH Wireless Weather Station was purchased as a Christmas gift. While this is a great addition, the outside temperature registers about 15 degrees higher than the actual temperature. We are in progress of returning/exchanging the station. Other features work beautifully and the expectation is with the outside temperature registering accurately, this will be a great present."
2,**** Beware La Crosse Technology does not back their Products,"I got a La Crosse Technology wireless thermometer as a present. I installed it as directed, put in new batteries as directed, and followed all of the installation and location suggestions. After a couple of years the temperature sensor stopped working.I contacted La Crosse Technology and eventually contacted Allan McCormick, President and Founder, and Scott Shies, Customer Service Manager and a direct report of Allan's.Scott, with the full knowledge of Allan basically told me tough, buy a new one. He stated that the manufacturer told them to only warranty the product for 12 months. When I pointed out that if it was taken care off, installed properly, it should work for more than two years, his response was "" buy a new one"".As an aside the retailer was more than willing to send me a new sensor, but La Crosse could care less.Understand this company before you buy their products. They do not support them."
1,The outdoor sensor just does not work.,"I bought it as present to my parents. However the ourdoor sensor does not work. I called the support and she told me in honesty that it is made in china! She shipped me another sensor to try but that does not work either. If you are interested in ourdoor temps, this is not for you :-)"
4,DIGITALwx STATION,THE PRODUCT IS JUST FINE--WORKS WELL AND NO PROBLEMS WITH THE UNIT SO FAR--PROGRAMMING FOR THEDIGITAL DUMMY WAS NOT EASY AS THE INSTRUCTION ARE MOST LIKELY AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION DONE BY ACHINESE TECH WRITER--ALWAYS A PROBLEM--THE TECH SUPPORT FROM THE COMPANY WAS A LITTLE SLOW IN COMING AFTER MY REQUEST BUT WAS VERY GOOD ONCE WE MADE CONTACT. THE PRODUCT IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE AND AMAZON SERVICE WAS GREAT AS USUAL
2,good product-bad information,"The weather station and remote sensor work very well, however, when you order the basic weather station, Amazon suggests ordering the wireless remote with the basic unit. When the product arrives you find the wireless remote is included with the base unit. If you're a dope like me, you'll assume that one remote is for indoors, and the other's for outdoors. This is not the case. The base unit reads indoor data and the wireless remote that comes with it goes outside. Guess I'll put the extra sensor on the other side of the house as the unit will gather info from two outside sources."
2,"IT'S ONLY 5-1/2"" TALL!!","While La Crosse Technology usually makes a good product, I sure felt ripped off when I opened the package to find this itty bitty thing that's not even six-inches tall. I admit it's my bad for not reading the product description more closely. I did give it one extra star for its appearance and accuracy. But I want everyone else to know: IT'S ONLY 5-1/2"" TALL and cost almost $40. And I returned it for that reason."
3,Very small,"Be sure to read the dimensions (I didn't). The pictures are deceiving because it is a lot smaller in person than what I imagined. It is about the size of a clock you would put on your bedside table. The display is 3"" tall and 1.75"" in width. The unit itself is 6"" tall and 4"" wide."
3,wireless thermometer,It worked well for about a year. Now the inside still works but outside sensor is gone.
5,Happy with service,"Purchased as a Christmas gift. It arrived promptly and without damage.I am very happy with the service. It hasn't been installed yet, so I can't rate the performance of the product yet."
4,Pretty sold and overall accurate,"Placement and nearby interference may hinder the temp accuracy outdoors, but in general this tends to be a better predictor than the local weather forecast or even the weather channel. It tends to give you about a 24-48 hour look-ahead on its weather section. Temps are good, indoor temp and humidity is soundly accurate. Overall, a great piece."
2,After 2 years it died,"While this weather station was working, it was great. Then it just stopped working. Perhaps I should not expect that such a product will work after just 2 years. But I will try some other brand to see it I can get one that lasts longer."
3,LaCrosse Weather Station,"I like the atomic clock feature the most. The fonts are a bit small for my old eyes. The weather prediction is quite nice as is the high and low temperatures. However the temperature feature is for highest and lowest EVER so I cannot tell for sure if it (for example) froze overnight last night. I get the temperature from last February. So, it is ok for the price - I like the one it replaced much more."
1,Worked well for a while.,"I purchased this device one year ago. The humidity sensor just up and died, ie it is no longer registering humidity. The indoor thermometer just became wildly inaccurate (I know my room isn't 120 degrees). It also is failing to connect to the remote sensor. On a positive note, the clock is still working. I'm looking to replace this device with something from Oregon Scientific."
1,doesn't work,"As long as the temperature is between 50 and 80 it works fine. But, anything lower or higher and it is not accurate. Don't buy it."
5,Great product,I bought this weather station for my mate over a year ago. The whole family loves it and uses it frequently. Very accurate.
1,Pick a different product,"Arrived and in mid-October and I'm back shopping for another weather station - which you can be sure will not be manufactured by La Crosse Technology. I never could get the remote sensor placed to give a reading where it was accurate, which defeats the main purpose for which I bought the thing in the first place. Now the remote sensor has quit working and this is going in the trash."
5,Much Better than Expected,"I have had several ""weather stations"" from varying brands over the past decade. This model from LaCrosse Technology works better than them all. It is simple to program (don't throw away the instructions...settings are not entirely intuitive), the readout is vividly clear, the temperature readings for hot, hot Phoenix appear to be relatively accurate, the ""forecast"" provides for multiple sensitivity settings (important for the dry desert), and the whole thing is surprisingly attractive."
3,Desk top only,"I had another weather station from LaCrosse which was much easier to read with larger print. This is very nice looking and works great but should only be used on a desk top. To small to be read past 3 feet. I purchased this one because it had all the features of my larger one. Unfortunately, all the features are to much for the small space allowed."
4,"Works well, looks good. Too bad it is not back lit.",Temp and humidity reading is accurate. Remote sensor works well. Not back lit so you are out of luck when the lights are off.
4,Know if you need a sweater or a rain coat!,"I was looking for a quick way to know how to dress the kids for school, without waiting for the TV to tell me... Anyway, I've got too much to do in the mornings to wait around for the TV. There are loads of these kinds of devices on the market, but very few with a sensor for indoor humidity, which I wanted. This along with the ""forecast"" feature, makes this one VERY useful device. The only thing I'd change is having the display backlit, because it can sometimes be a little difficult to see in certain light conditions...Conclusion: Works as advertized, delivers the necessary information with no fuss, and amazingly, it's REALLY accurate with the forecasts. I've learned to trust the device... Even with it doesn't look like it's going to rain. It's worth the money."
4,Husband Loved It!,"This was really cool - my husband is a weather addict so, I thought this would be a neat gift for him. The only drawback it has (for us anyway) is that the display is hard to read - it would be really neat if it had a backlight on it."
3,full features-small in size,"This product has all the features I was looking for; however, it's small size makes viewing readouts from any distance difficult."
5,satisfied,"This was my first product from LaCrosse Technology, and am completely satisfied.I'm a weather bug and have been for 50 years, and I watch what type of products I purchase and from whom."
4,Weather station,"It was a gift to me many years ago and still going strong. Decided to gift it to a friend. The only problem I have is setting to time zone with Daylight savings. Other than that, I would buy the same weather station again and again. The BEST PRICE was at AMAZON."
2,Didn't last long,"Very disappointed. Bought it last year as a Christmas gift for my husband. The weather station didn't last the year. Batteries died quickly and whenever we had to change them, we had to reset the station which was more difficult than necessary. I do not recommend this weather station."
3,AFTER 5-6 YEARS OF OWNING ONE,"I bought this model (or very similar) 5 or 6 years ago. Here is how it is holding up.A couple of years ago the buttons on the bottom started sticking, they hardly work now. When the temp outside gets below 30, the outside temp display may not show anything (putting new batteries in the outside sending unit may help, I have not bothered to try).The outside sending unit had to be replaced after about 4 years.The good news is that the clock works just as it is supposed to, both the indoor and outdoor thermometer are accurate (except as stated above) and are reliable."
2,Second failed La Crosse Weather Station,"When my first La Crosse Ws-7014CH-IT Weather Station arrived it did not work. I sent it back and got another one. This one failed after 1 month. I'm generally happy with the station when it works, but it seems as though La Crosse has a quality problem. If you are lucky enough to get a good one you will probably be happy."
3,Nice. Smaller than I expected. No true forecast.,"First off, the battery life is great. I've had this for 8 months and haven't changed the batteries in either part. Also, it's nice to be able to see the outside temperature without having to run a wire somewhere. The humidity and air pressure are somewhat less significant, because they are sensed by the indoor portion, rather than the outdoor sensor. The ""forecast"" on the display is just driven by the air pressure and nothing else. If the pressure is increasing, it displays nice weather (sun). If the pressure is decreasing, it displays bad weather (rain). I wish the display was a little bigger. You have to get pretty close to it to read it."
5,phenamenol!!!!!!,This book is amazing. You will be amazed by the main characters and their discoveries. It makes you think about your options in life and that the information you are given is not always the most accurate. It is a definite must read if you are one of those that believes there is more to life than what we are told and taught.
2,And they lived happily forever after! (or did they?),"This is an entertaining bit of fiction and there are plenty of disclaimers to let everyone know not to believe a word of it. And yet, you get thinking that Max might make a mistake and cause someone to grow a third leg , to go crazy or to develop cancer. As you read the book, you wonder whether he could make zombis out of all of his subjects. Unfortunately the incidence of such side effects is not reported in the book. Where do all the side effect people go? Can they come to him and get changed back or is it permanent? (If it is permanent, there may be no legal recourse because of all of the disclaimers!)"
3,"""If it's too good to be true......""","First off I must confess that despite the repititious nature of the book, the subject matter IS engrossing, that's why I gave it three stars. It was easy to get carried away by the promise of real healing. By the end of the novel I was actually interested enough to go on-line and visit the author's website and do research on his company. Being of a spiritual bent I'm always ready to try new things, albeit with a modicum of reason. Folks, although someday we may actually see technology as described in the book be available, Stephen Lewis hasn't discovered or invented anything useful. Sorry to kill your buzz. I was a bit crushed as well upon discovering that, yes, it's just another brilliant scam. Save your hard-earned dollars and do something for yourself that actually has a proven pedigree like qi gong, right diet, serving others, engaging in learning. Peace."
4,Good concert,"This is not that bad of a concert. The only thing is the video is not the best of quality, but it is enjoyable to watch if you like Huey Lewis."
5,Great Romantic Comedy!!!,"This is a great romantic comedy about 2 ladies who share their passion and love for food,family and friendship.It's a must see!!!"
3,This DVD played like a very worn-out VHS tape.,This DVD played like a very worn-out VHS tape. Maybe it was made from one. Terrible picture and sound quality.
1,These books are an insult to the Chronicles of Narnia,"I cannot understand why people feel the need to water down wonderful things. How arrogant are adults to assume that children must be given something ""easier to swallow?!"" I was by no means an extraordianry child, but my father read the chronicles, the complete chronicles, to me when I was three. Of course I dodn't understnad some of it the first time, but if father had read less challenging things to me, I am sure I would not developed as completely in the areas of imagination, intellectual, and emotion development. Please don't spend your money on this lushly illustrated insult to literature."
5,love em,"These shoes are great. They are a bit crazier looking in person than pictured; the two-tone finish is distinct and the lines of the wingtip are exaggerated, the sort of shoe you'd half-expect to be worn by one of the Joker's henchmen. They take some attitude to pull off, and I usually wear then going out. But I've also worn them with a suit and though they get attention they aren't so out there that I feel ridiculous.As for the other reviewers comments, I disagree in part. These are leather, but the look is achieved by a two-tone finish that is sort of painted on, black over white or brown over tan. I have the brown/tan pair and they've held up fine. I can see how scratching might be more of a problem on the black/white combo, but I'd imagine some polish or scratch cover would fix all but the biggest accidents."
2,Bahhhhhhhhh,"I'll keep this short. ICP sucks, they always have. the staind cover is overhyped. Nonpoints ""the tribute"" is one of the best covers done, with dynmite hacks ""boyz n tha hood"" another neo-classic. the rest of the album is ok but let's be honest there are few covers that do well to good songs. they should have improved upon some old fat boys songs if any artists TRULY wanted to do something noteworthy"
2,"Good general overview, NOT a tuning guide","This was a nice and easy read with plenty of great information on all Holley carbs in general. It even included a little bit of repair and selection information, but it was far from comprehensive, and it had no tuning information whatsoever. If the title was ""Holley 4160/4150 Introduction and Overview"" then I would give this 5 stars. But since I thought I was getting a book that would help me tune it gets only 2."
4,just got,just came today but husband perused it and likes what he sees so far was impressed with price and how quickly it arrived also
5,Great Milling!,"This is an excellent pepper mill. With the salt shaker on top, it is very convenient. The pepper grinds out very fast! It's a blizzard of pepper, more than the ""Unicorn"" brand I also have. I prefer this because I use tons of pepper on my food and want it done quickly and easily. It grinds as finely as any mill I have ever used. Refilling requires the usual carefulness but it's simple. The square body makes it easy to grip, even with BBQ sauce between your grip. The build quality is ordinary as it is acrylic, but it works darn well and looks better on the table than in this picture."
3,"Overwhelming Music, Underwhelming Performances","This CD was a good idea, poorly executed. The problem is the performances themselves. We have the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic, and the Seattle Symphony, all with varying results. Particularly rough in this recording is the Scottish orchestra, whose principal trombone player sounds like he's out to draw blood, though the Seattle and Royal performances are also lackluster. There is a much better compilation by the City of Prague Philharmonic with Nic Raine conducting. Spare yourself this mess and go for the best."
5,The best Godzilla film ever to grace the silver screen!,This is by far the most action-packed Godzilla movie yet! I especially like the fact that Rodan returns to the series. Ifukuble's score is masterful. Includes some excellent human drama. GvsMG 2 contains some of the best acting and special effects in the whole series! The climatic battle is breathtaking! I 've seen all 23 Godzilla films (including the American) and this is the best! Its a must have!
5,Mechagodzilla for the 90's................,"Not bad for 90's Godzilla movie. Updated effects! Unlike like the other 90's release, this one got both language english, and japanese. Hopefully Sony will do the same for the other 90's release."
3,3 1/2 stars,"This movie isn't the most action packed 'zilla. That's ""Godzilla vs the destoyer"" The coolest is 'space 'zilla'. The 'zilla with the best fight is Bollant or whatever. The one with the 'zilla plant. The most fun is 'monster zero'the dumbest by far is the first 'mecagodzilla' even-though 'zilla's revengeis close. The 'zilla with the best firebreath action is 'zilla 2000 ."
5,Mechagodzilla II,"Godzilla Vs Mechagodzilla was made in 1993, where (if can't ya already tell) Godzilla fight Mechagodzilla but it is not the same mechagodzilla as the 50's series, nope this one is made by the Japanese government to fight Godzilla, and strangely enough Rodan as well, though Mechagodilla can't really stand its ground with the real godzilla but it does some serious damage to Rodan."
4,"Doña Blanca is good, but not the best.","""Hispanic Games & Rhymes"" is better than ""Doña Blanca"" for my purposes. I teach high school Spanish 1 in a Houston suburb. I wanted a dual-language book with simple vocabulary for my beginning students to practice reading."
5,Golden times,"frank sinatra, dean martin, sammy davis junior where magnificent and when you hear this unplugged by Tony Benett you'll see what real music is a must own...."
2,Tony Bennett - Voice Not what it use to be,"You can easily see that this man is struggling to hit the notes. With respect to this great singer , the DVD does not do him justice.The picture quality is poor and the bass at times just jumps up to an annoying sound. The once smooth Bennett is struggling and this is even more evident when singing with KD Lang and Elvis Costello.I'm a Tony Bennett fan , but I was disappointed with many aspects of this DVD. Even after several adjustments of Sub Woofer, Bass, speaker decibels, the sound reproduction of some of the intruments dominant the sound.Sorry Tony, my money would have been spent better else where."
3,Lesser tracks from the giants of jazz,"Yes, the big names of jazz are represented here, and the music is fine, but after several listenings of all 4 cd's I have yet to find a stand-out track. For a dinner party background playlist it's fine, but an anthology of great jazz it is not."
5,Soul Healing in Action,"Master Sha influenced my life much more than words can express. I want to share with you one extraordinary thing I have found, with you. My illness has as a symptom Acid Reflux Disease. I don't treat it with Tums or GasX but with the co-operation of the soul of my energy. When I feel indigestion I in an authoritative tone of voice I ask it to take the excess energy in my throat and digestive system and send it to my Lower Dan Tian. It has worked repeatedly for me. I Am sure the book Soul Wisdom will put a heavenly spin on you life. Thank you, thank you, thank you."
5,Priceless Treasure,"Dr. Zhi Gang Sha's phenomenal new book reveals spiritual wisdom and secrets to healing the total human condition. More than mind over matter, Dr. Sha teaches us that the most profound healing occurs on the ""soul"" level. When the soul is healed, healing of the mind and body will follow. The information and techniques in this book are priceless. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in attaining optimum health and vitality!"
5,Sweet,"I've used a wrist strap for many years and always wanted to try a T-Handle, but a little expensive. I saw this one was a good deal here so bought it. I think it's the best addition to my bow shooting to date. Great on draw, and adjusts to whatever trigger pressure you want. I'm left handed and it is great."
1,5 stars for the DVD - 1 star for the rip-off dealer!,I am stunned to see that someone would resell Sharilynn Miller's EXCELLANT instructional video for 4 times the retail price!! Buy the DVD but get it directly from Sharilyn for the real price of $29.95. This kind of gouging is absolutely unconscionable.
4,Great book on organizational devleopment,Ordered this book as part of the text required for my human resource development calls. For comprehensive.
2,Nothing Much,"Was disappointed to find out that only two small sections in the front of the hair actually change color. In addition, the color changes from a blueish violet color to blue. Which means the change is hardly visibile. To make the color change back you have to use a small cloth type thing that you put a piece of ice in. So I don't know why the description says it changes with a magic brush. My four year old was excited to play with it but after less than one minute of rubbing the washcloth and barely seeing a color change she walked away.Also, her doll came with really cute orange boots but they do NOT stay on which is really frustrating to a four year old. Overall I am NOT impressed with this doll!!!!"
2,Nope,"This chain is ment for a puppy or a small breed dog. I have a pitbull and it only lasted for about a week, the chain broke, I would suggest buying a old school chain from homedepot with the links."
3,Nothing like the show on Fuel TV,I bought this thinking it would be exactly the same as the show on Fuel TV. Man was I disappointed.... It didn't have any of the normal commentary/interviews like the normal show. Other than that it was good.
4,Thought-Provoking Overview of Evangelical Theology,"Witherington's book analyzes the exegetical shortcomings of Reformed Theology, Dispensationalism and Wesleyanism. The main point of the book is to say that every system of evangelical theology has its blind spots. These exegetical weaknesses can be overcome by a return to commitment to knowing the first century context of the New Testament. In addition, Witherington says there must be a commitment to reject modern thinking which has influenced our theology. Witherington says that the parts of each theological system that make it distinctive are the places of greatest exegetical weakness. I am sure that proponents of the various views would strongly disagree, but this is Witherington's contention. This book caused me to think about my own theological presuppositions and the need to seek the truth in a deeper way."
5,Duofold International Black and Platinum Trim Nib Medium,"The Parker Duofold International is a cartridge or convertor fill pen. The convertor stills well enough, but something that gave a positive lock, like a click or some other 'good' sound would be nice. The pen writes well straight from the box and works even better after frunning a cartridge of ink through the nib and then cleaning it. The medium nib writes a smooth fairly wet line that is about 2 mm wide line which is what I have come to expect from moden Parker pens, especially the International Duofolds. It is a nice line and if you have a large expressive signature and writing style, then I think this would be an excellent choice. If on the otherhand you tend to write smallish letters the wide and wet line are fine if you wite at a rapid pace. I write with faily large capitals and medium sized script, so this works quite well for me. Best wishes in your shopping."
5,One of my favorite cds of all time!,"Why is this cd great? I'm a harsh critic and i'll tell you my oppinion.1.mixed perfectly. the vocals aren't too loud or soft. this is important as a lot of the best ""underground cd's"" have this. Yet you can still hear what the singer is saying.2. passion. passion is also in every formula to a great cd (in my oppinion). you won't find cd's as passionant as this.3.sing along lyrics. just about every great punk cd you can sing the message with your friends.4. a fast, hard, dark soundthis cd though produced through trials, like many other great bands (Underoath) became their best! as ChadWiggins and crew knew an important part of music fromula in general: harder, faster, stronger, darker.that's what this cd was compared to their old stuff, and it was a perfect outlet for their new challenges!Buy one of the best Christian punk Cd's ever! after a couple listens you'll get it (like all great cd's)."
2,Is it over yet?,"This book was way too long. The tale of the missing money and the subsequent tracking of a faceless hacker could have been told in 200 pages. What I found really tedious were all the phone calls - calls to try to track the hacker and to various government agencies to try to get help to catch the intruder. Phone calls can only be so interesting. Yes, it is real life and real life is never (I hope) as interesting as fiction - but by the time the hacker was caught, I was just happy to see the book end."
2,Good tech book,"Berkeley astronomer tracks a German spy through a maze of computer espionage. Interesting information about computer technology and security, but the suspense of the chase was not all that good."
2,Boring and highly repetitious,Reading the book was a drag. It is repetitious and technically dated. The author tries to add a human dimension by inserting episodes of his personal life but it seems out of place. I started on it 6 weeks ago and still haven't finished it and it wasn't from lack of trying.
4,Fiction for geeks,"Cliff Stoll is a astrologer at the University of Berkeley but discovered accidentally (by a stupid financial irregularity of 75 cents) an unauthorized user on their computer. From then goes on a cat and mouse game, between Cliff and the hacker.The commands (telnet, whois ...) in this book were something magical i wanted to know everything about.At that time I was already crazy and keenly interested in computers and networks but the Internet still was something far away (at least for me). With a little luck I could connect to some BBS (Bulletin Board System) using Gopher and we were suddenly in distant America. WaauwCliff Stoll was my childhood idol and I knew then that I really wanted to do something similar!"
1,SHAME ON YOU!,This is so unfair.Is there a web site we can log on and vote for a protest? Can somebody arrange something like that?WE WANT REST OF THE SEASONS TO BE RELEASED!
1,This is silly.,"Mad About You is a fine tv programme... I'm English and happened to catch an episode on freeview by accident and was completely hooked by the sharp script, witty set-ups and general easy raport between the two fantastic leads, Helen Hunt and the fantastic Paul Reiser.It shows how great the show is that I am willing to wade through this unfamiliar American website to see if I can buy all the series... and I am appalled by this so-called ""Best Of"". There seems to be very little in the way of extras on the first two releases, and I refuse to be conned by the studio into shelling out the extra cash for this.It's almost as though the studio is using the love dedicated fans of Mad About You feel for the programme. Shame on you!"
1,Not Okay!,I love this show and of course I bought this DVD set. I can't believe the rest of the series won't be released. Dissappointed!
3,The Mad About You Collection,"I have been a Mad About You fan since the beginning. And like so many others, I was thrilled to see the seasons become available on DVD. I can't believe that it's not worth releasing the remaining seasons compared to some of the horrible shows that are for sale right now!What I find upsetting about this compilation is that it contains episodes from seasons one and two. Hello! I've already bought those seasons! They could have atleast compiled episodes that I don't have access to, especially if Sony is never going to let me have the rest of the seasons!I think it's truly a shame that the upcoming generations will be denied this classic program about two wonderful characters."
4,Mad About Mad About You,"I purchased the season 1 and 2 on dvd and LOVE them...I work late into the night, and when I am sick to DEATH of reruns on Nick at Night of all those stupid shows, I pop in one of my Mad About You disks and watch them....I want the other seasons IN FULL to come out really soon!!! Yeah, sure maybe the last couple of seasons were kinda strange, they did kinda ""Jump the shark"", but nevertheless, I love the show, as I know ALOT of people do. It would be a rotten shame if they dont put the other seasons out on DVD soon!!"
3,Waiting for Season 3!,"Thank you for this collection, Sony. I'm sure it is great... but we want it all! Raise the prices if you have too! We'll pay any price! Just give us every episode! That's what we want!"
1,Ah come on!,"Die hard Mad about you fans are still waiting for the next season release, not a ""best of"" release. What a waste of planning to come up with this. Listen to the consumers! If you are not going to release the next season, then give the rights to another distribution company who will hear us!"
4,GREAT ENTERTAINMENT,"Well, I bought this DVD cos I remember catching glimpses of the show in the nineties - and then thinking...""Hmm this is good"" - and then I read an online interview with the great Jack Klugman who said ""I like Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt. I think they're real and funny""....And they are....this is so watchable. The only reason I won't give this five stars is cos of the intro's to several episodes...Paul Reiser is Paul Reisers biggest fan. ...That alone bceomes tiresome on this DVD"
5,Outstanding older book,"Outstanding book about Los Angeles, a must-read for anyone interested in history, architecture, and culture.It reads like poetry."
1,Willam Shatner Look out...You have some competition....,"As a huge dance, trance, and techno fan, several friends of mine gathered to review this album in my home. Needless to say, we were quite disappointed. To listen to any composition on this album with ""remix"" in the title is quite disturbing. In my opinion, remixes are made from original hits that have already been sucessful in the music industry. This, however, does not live up to our expectations. It does have a good beat yet it isn't the groove driven dance beats of artists like ""Cher"", ""Madonna"" and ""Janet Jackson"". The music in general is depressing as well as a story about Kathy Lee's heartache and pain she has felt in her many years with Mr. Gifford. We did try to give this album a chance. Again, we appreciate the effort, yet it doesn't live up to today's musical standards. Thanks but no thanks Kathy Lee. :)"
4,Kathie Lee,"I have never listened to a Kathie Lee album before until this album came out..what drawn me to the this album was the first single ""Love Never Fails,"" I found it to be a very moving song..Kathie Lee, has in my own mind made a good convert to a danceable pop genre."
5,Love The CD!,"Kathie Lee Gifford has proven to America that she is not going to let the press get the best of her and this CD proves that she can make it anywhere. I bought her CD and think the songs are relaxing, upbeat, and fun! This CD is truly her best work and anyone will be able to find something to take away from one of her songs. I can hardly wait until she comes out with another!!"
5,it was terrific,"I thought The Heart of a Woman was a terrific CD! Kathie Lee is a beautiful singer and person. I""ve always loved her christmas recordings and look forward to many more!"
3,Good guide to Guerrero,"Actually, it's a great guide to Guerrero. The title, however, reads ""Acapulco,"" which is the guide I was looking for when I purchased this book. Only 20-25% is dedicated to Acapulco, the rest to the coastal and upcountry areas of Guerrero."
5,A great product,The rocket pops set works great and it's sturdy. It also saves space in the freezer since they can be removed from the base and stacked in the freezer once they're frozen. My boys really enjoy eating popsicles in the shape of rockets.
2,Too hard to get out,"We make a version of popsicles with a bit of Jello and kool-aid. These are really hard to get out. Run under hot water, wiggle for 2-3 minutes - hope the stick doesn't pull off. Stand is nice and sturdy and good to remove 1 at a time but shape is too complex and hard to get out of mold."
2,Just OK,"I've refilled these 3 times in the past few weeks and one broke on the second time of use. The stick part that goes into popsicle and one of the outer casings has cracked.Next time, I'll be looking for something that will hold up better.They also are a bit tricky to get out of the casing!"
5,Just what I wanted,They work well and they are fun for kids. Fruit Rocket pops have been a great addition to our summer.
2,Many have broken already!,I bought this product after reviewing many- I really love that the molds are separate BUT already 2 of the handles have broken and one of the clear molds has cracked. I've only had these a couple of months! Also it says they are top rack dishwasher safe but one of the clear molds melted a little at the bottom in the dishwasher so after that we hand washed them---its tricky to get the sponge into the top of the lid to clean it well. I am pretty disappointed as this product costs more then most and to be down to only 4 working molds already I fear they will all be unusable in the near future!
2,Too Much Rap,"This CD is one of the worst compilations of new pop music on the market today. I received it as a gift from a friend who has no taste in music.Sonique's ""It feels so good"" will send you sailing with her warm, sexy voice, but that's about it. Other songs, like ""Bling Bling"" were not real radio sensations and seem out of place with this collection. Overall, this album is a manufactured piece of garbage.If you want to make rich idiots even richer, then buy this sorry album."
3,Not a favorite,"I enjoy most of Heather Graham's books (that I have read) however, this is not one of my favorite. I found it to be too repetitous in descriptions of situations, locations, people, etc. The story itself was pretty good, just too long an wordy."
3,nice read,"This book was a good read, but I have to say it was not one of my favorites by Heather Graham. I did love all the details surrounding the area the character's happen to be in. You can actually see yourself there as well. Sometimes I could imagine being able to smell the land and the sea! Ms. Graham is a wonderful author and I would buy her books any day."
3,"More fiction than history,","More fiction than history...It was an ok book, but a bit much- I don't believe women in the 14th century had that much freedom or used some of the language she Danielle used. If you are reading fpr enjoyment only, it's a o.k. book."
3,"Easy, fun read",I prefer a little most historical facts with the story. Easy read for time at the beach or looking to escape.
1,"I would give this no stars, actually","I hated the writing style, the story, the characters . . . . need I say more? I did not make it more than 50 pages or so into the book and I had to stop to preserve my sanity."
5,Charcuterie,"Exactly the information we were looking for. Explicit instructions how to make hams, prosciutto, salami, and other meats. Written clear and succinctly, it gives you everything you need. Anyone that really smokes meats should read this!!"
4,Can now make my own Salami,"Full of usefull info. Covers various meat types - beef, game, fish, pork, fowl. Good variety of preserving styles. Good info regarding equipment needed. At last i can now make my own salami and tastes like salami should."
2,I had to modify this feeder in order for food not to run all over the place.,"The feeder has 2 tabs in the female screw in area that accepts the bottle that prevents it from going al lthe way in. THey are too long and the neck of the bottle is above the rim of the feeding tray. I had to san down the top of the female screw in section as well as cut about 3/16 off the tabs inside the screw in section to prevent the sugar water from ibbediatly running out on the ground. Once I made the necessary modification the feeder works perfectly. It;s a beautiful feeder, the mold maker of the tray and bottle should be ""written-up""."
3,"Excellent Film, Terrible DVD","LA DOLCE VITA is top notch Fellini... unfortunately, this DVD suffers from a lot of compression, and ridiculous artifacts (""stair stepping"" of vertical lines)"
2,Possibly one of the most boring of all classic films,"A staple of ""Best of"" guides, beloved by critics, a huge success on its release and...one of the most boring films you will ever see.Self-indulgent and gargantuan in length, you will be left wondering what all the fuss is about - and why Fellini is so over-rated."
1,Wasn't what I expected!,I was not thrilled with this movie. I thought it was going to be better than it was unfortunately. It was very long and boring. I actually fell asleep while watching it. I wanted to return it to the seller but I felt bad because the seller mailed it out to me right away and it was delivered so fast.I am not sure that I would recommend this movie to anyone? Maybe I will have to watch it again and hope that it is better the second time around?La Dolce Vita (2-Disc Collector's Edition)
3,Seriously disappointed no Support for WM5 PPC,"After getting my clients and myself over to Microsoft Money with them on the way to upgrade to SBA since ""Microsoft products play well"" microsoft pulls stupid yes stupid things like this. This was a record year increase in sales of PPC. Who at Microsoft don't get it? If you release WM5 you would expect any product 2005 on would work on it! When I saw 2007 was out I was happy to be able to go to my clients and say here the wait is over we can go ahead and move up.... But no. Sad. Sorry MS not getting your money and your not getting ours this time. Someone screwed up."
3,I agree - the Invoice designer is LAME!,"I've used Money since the early days. Whereas Money is probably every bit as good as Quicken (plenty of discontent in that camp too) and it works fine for most tasks, as business software the invoice component is critical. Trying to edit or design an invoice is just plain frustrating and extremely limited, rendering it almost useless. Trying to add a discount is rediculous as well with half the discount information refusing to show. Most adverts can be disabled but I do still get ""reminders"" from MS about new products which I would prefer to turn off."
2,"Title deceiving, Still has merit.","This book is deceiving. It should include on the cover somewhere that you have to send away for the design plans. I did that very thing when building my current home. That worked out well for my husband and I. So there is merit in ""buying design plans"" but the book should be more up front about what's inside. With that said, there are a variety of unexpected, fun designs."
1,Assembly instructions are terrible,"I'm in the middle trying to build the Three Bin Composter in this book. It says the ""complete instructions"" are in the book for free-- one of the few plans in here that you don't have to order. There is a LOT of missing information, and I think that some of the dimensions listed in the materials section are incorrect. This is pretty simple, so I'll just guess my way through it, but I would NOT use this company if you are looking for plans for something more complictated."
1,Cheap!,Broke same day that we got it! And he wasn't overly rough with it either. I was expecting it to last a little longer.
1,Very very poorly made,"Don't buy, this is litterally 2 pieces of insulation tube tied with a rope (see my picture):- very very very cheap- not safe for kids (isolation tube really !!!???)- horrible smell of PVCI'm sure the 2 others reviews are fake"
4,Perfect for ninja costume!,Bought it to go with my sons ninja costume and it was just what he wanted. He has played with it a lot and it has been very durable. Good product!
4,"Fun toy, perfect weight.","I purchased these nunchaku for my 14 year old son as more of a joke. They are a good weight because they are heavy enough to swing around well, but not so heavy that they could hurt someone badly."
4,A lovely score,"I caught the production last year at the New York Musical Theatre Festival, and I think this show is a fanciful stage adaptation of a very smart little sci-fi film. The music and lyrics presented here by the original cast are smart, moving, and full of good tunes. I like it very much and I recommend it heartily."
4,Lots of info,"Lots of good info, a little too much 'fluff' I'm the beginning of the book, but overall it's a good read."
2,I found this book to be disappointing,"This book might be helpful to parents of newborns who have no idea how to play with their children. For everyone else, it has a pretty obvious and unimaginative take on how to use toys to stimulate language development. A typical suggested dialog for playing with legos is: ""Yes, Bobby, that is a blue block! Here is another blue block! Now there are two blue blocks and they are exactly the same!"" and so on. There are lots of lists of things your child should be doing at various ages; but if you are interested in this book, your child has special needs and you probably already know he/she isn't going to develop in a typical way. To me, this book wasn't worth the money."
4,quick and mostly painless,I would recommend this item. It came quickly enough and I was happy that I could save $200 from having one professionaly installed. The only draw back wathat you really needed two people to install it. That wasn't even really necessary until you had to really pull down on the exhaust pipe to sneak it by. It installed in about an hour total after we figured that out.
5,Quality,Exactly as described. Boted on with no problems. Intsalled it myseld in the driveway. Difficulty on a 1-10 scale= 5
5,Not easy to install.,"It took a while to install it, not the 30 minutes they claim. But at the end works fine needs two persons to install it."
4,Good quality,"This is a good quality hitch. It was a bit of a pain to install myself, took a 3' long torque wrench to remove the factory bolts, and was a very snug fit that took the help of a rubber mallet to knock it into place 1/32"" at a time.Overall, I am very happy with it. Directions were easy to follow and packaging was good. While it was a bit of a pain to do it myself, it was well worth the $100 it saved me."
4,"Air pockets make for LOTS of stopping, poking, and restarting","We make smoothies a couple of times a day using frozen fruit - pineapple, raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries - along with various juices. With all the rave reviews and the 1 horse power motor of this Pro Line Kitchen Aid blender, I was disappointed that air pockets form so readily around the blade. Just seconds after I turn it on, the blender stops blending until I stop the motor, poke the fruit down with a spatula, and restart. I usually have to do this about 4 or 5 times to make a simple smoothie. If I add plenty of juice, it is less prone to this problem; however, we like our smoothies thick. Once the fruit is blended enough to keep air pockets from forming, it makes a GREAT smoothie - far superior to the Kitchen Aid 1/2 horse power food processor I used to use. It's also attractive and the handle is light weight. The motor also regularly smells of smoke; hopefully this is because it is so new?"
1,This Version Is Abridged - Not The Complete Version,"The version for around $14 that Amazon is selling is not the full version - it has been abridged and this has not been made clear in the description of the item. I would rate it ZERO stars if I could.I own the full set of this series on LD but wanted a set which could be taken on travel.If you are on a budget then this version is OK, but for those of us who have watched it for years it is unsatisfactory UNLESS Amazon lists it as being abridged from the original. CAVAET EMPTOR."
2,Victory At Sea..,"Bearing in mind that we're reviewing early 1950s technology, Victory at Sea isn't bad. The music tended to be too 'busy' and too loud much of the time. The narration had a patriotic flair, which at times got in the way of the story. Such documentaries seem to unable to reach into our emotions. An interview with someone affected by the war would have been in order. Victory at Sea would have been great were it condensed and included in ""War and Remembrance,"" my favorite mini-series."
3,"Very nice, very heavy, not very strong","I received this as a wedding gift and it is beautiful. It is HEAVY (shipping weight of 8.4lbs... for a picture frame!)!After 3 years of having it on display (landscape orientation) I picked it up to clean the table it was on and when I put it back down the pivoting hinge that holds the leg to the backing snapped off. I contacted Waterford and they pointed me to their website where they sell just the backing for $15.I will be buying a new backing because we love the frame. It's unfortunate that the new backing is black and the original is white, but I'll deal. But, I was sad to see a gift that (I now see) costs a lot of money break after only 3 years."
1,same 'ol same 'ol,"I am not excited about this purchase because it is just ""another hints book"" like all the other authors. I wish someone could come up with a better book pertaining to this subject!"
5,There is Brilliance in the Basics,"Often in life we get so caught up wanting the ""newest, latest, greatest"" idea that we fail to realize the brilliance in the basics. Mastering the basics is truely a prerequisite for success and fulfillment. Greg Reid's book the Millionaire Mentor is an easy to read and fun guide that reminds us of the amazing power we have within when focus on the little things that truly make the biggest difference. I love this book. I couldn't put it down. I read it in one sitting and it made a significant impact. Thank You."
2,Ripped pages,The exam at the end of the book was ripped out. This was not indicated in the description of the book. Although the book was only 3 dollars this should have been mentioned.
4,Grand Strategy with Plenty of Micro-Management,"Fun strategy game, even if the interface is a bit low-tech. Captures the tough choices commanders had to make when it came to how and when to commit valuable assets such as carrier groups. The strength of the game is in the detail and range of options with your sea and air assets. Land-based units are less sophisticated with fewer options. Still, an engrossing game overall. But be prepared to manage supply and support resources as well as to fight battles on land, sea, and in the air."
5,FINALLY!,"It's disgraceful to make us wait so many years for the rest of the series..hurry up already!! Just release seasons 3-6 at the same time, or keep them coming every couple of months, not years!"
5,Country Blues String Band Style,"It's not often that you get to hear old blues artists within a band setting. Usually it's just one guy and his acoustic guitar. What sets Mr. Estes' blues apart is the inclusion of mandolin, harmonica, fiddle, and occasional piano. His own guitar picking and his, dare I say, cute voice, make this CD irresistable. The music is catchy and the thoughtful lyrics are easily decipherable. As far as I'm concerned, no blues collection is complete without this CD."
5,Must read for all,"An awesome tale of a Canada goose who fights through major injury in not very easy circumstances. A great bond is formed between animal and human, with trust as the cornerstone of the relationship. A perfect title, as this goose possesses courage that mamy humans can only dream about. Long live Bandy!"
5,Absolutely beautiful!,I bought two of these books to give as christmas presents. I barely made it in the door with them and my husband had to open one. Here I am ordering another to replace the one my husband couldn't wait to read. Words can not decribe the beauty of this book.
5,Worthy of permanent display on a coffee table,"This book is excellent in look, feel, and quality. It is intriguing to see how much landscape has changed in 130 years. Many times for the better and many times for the worse. In every case it is very interesting to see two pictures side by side and compare 1870 with 2000. The photographer was very meticulous to capture every shot as closely as possible to the original perspective and frame, which really enhances the ""then and now"" feel of the book."
5,Splendid,Fielder painstakingly retraced the steps of WH Jackson to vividly depict the 100 plus years between Jackson's eye and Fielder's eye. He gloriously proves that 100 years elapsing is a wink of an eye when it comes to history. Perhaps one has to live in Colorado to really appreciate the magnificence of the work. It was great fun to look at the comparable photographs and try to find the differences that have occurred in that time. And then you want to go and see the site for yourself. It will serve more than take up room on your coffee table.
4,Well-occupied time.,"I enjoyed this book. The story was quite interesting, but I was most intrigued by the writing style of Ms. Williams. She writes with such clarity and magnificent description that I could clearly view every moment of the story as if it were on screen. The reading was pleasurable, to say the least, without an inkling of vulgarity even when she described the couples' intimate moments. This story covered every emotion possible and I felt them all while reading. I'm happy I took a chance on Robyn Williams and look forward to reading from her in the future.Also, this is a WORK OF FICTION, meaning its UNTRUE, IMAGINARY, a FANTASY! I'm baffled as to why readers are complaining that the characters or the events throughout the story seem unrealistic. Correct me if I'm wrong, but...isn't that the point?? If you want realistic, read the newspaper!"
5,Works perfectly,"I am certainly not technical, but this was very easy to install (just be delicate with it!) and it has definitely improved my old computer"
2,Beware!!!Some Manufacturing Issues!!!,"I purchased this tractor for my 2yr. old son and found that not only was it much too short for a child of this age to ride but that the front piece of this product, which requires simply assembly, does not bond together correctly. The pictures and descriptions of this product show the consumer a stoutly built childs toy when in fact ours required gorilla glue to hold together the only three pieces that aren't part of the origional molding. This product is totted for usage by 3 to 5 year olds but I hope that upon reading this other parents will skip past all of the 5 star ratings and reconsider purchasing this product. I found this product dissapointing at the least."
3,cute tractor,"I am not sure about any durability or how long the stickers will last, i ordered this for my neice in the states no doubt until winter is over it will be aninside toy. my sister said she opened the package it looks like, its going ot be easy enough to put together, thank you for getting it there so quickly"
1,A waste of time. Save your money.,"No suspense. Characters you can't care about. Predictable twists and turns. You can see everything coming, why can't the protaganist? yawn....whadda a bore."
3,so-so product,"After years of tossing out miss-matched Tupperware and Rubbermaid containers, I decided to try this product. The idea that the lids worked on each size container appealed to me. The quality is fair -- about what you would expect from an infomerical product (more hype than quality), but it's no where near Tupperware standards. My biggest complaint is that the small containers (there are 3 sizes) are TINY. I cannot even imagine what you would put in them. It looks like they hold the equivalent of a jar of baby food. For me, they are a waste. The other 2 sizes are decent and the idea of saving space is a plus."
1,Save your money,"I bought this thinking it would end my problems with finding the right bowl and the right lid, you know the drill. Its easy to find the right lid on these, everyone is the same size but for the love of god the bowls arent big at all. Im not sure what you could put in them food wise anyway. And the construction of this is soooo cheap. I felt ripped off, very ripped off. I recommend the ""find the bowl and the right lid"" technique over this anyday. It would have gotten a zero star rating but amazons rating system doesnt go that low."
1,Great idea but ...,"Have had my product for 3 weeks. Great idea, great design, but quality sucks. In three weeks of somewhat use, two of the 24 oz containers are kaput, the bottoms having cracked open.Attempts to contact the company for replacement have been ignored."
2,Does Not Do Well On High-Def Signals,"I purchased this device to hook up a Cablevision box plus a standard DVD player to an Olevia LT30HV HDTV. This earlier model HDTV has only one set of component inputs, no HDMI but DVI. I noticed no degradation in the signal from the DVD player (480p) but there was definitely an inferior signal with high-definition TV channels (1080i). Will be exchanging this unit for an Impact Acoustics 3-Play."
1,Hope dashed!,"The box was really easy to set up - I had Dish, DVD and Apple TV all on RGB.The picture and sound quality was great.Then after a week or so it kept dropping any session and reverting to channel 1 after a few minutes. Also the remote would refuse to work on occasions til you cycled the power. Its cheap - so I guess you expect this - maybe I was unlucky as it worked great for a while. Hopefully Amazon will replace and the next will work as designed.Update: Amazon replaced it and the next box did just the same. The Apple TV when connected to the TV works perfectly but when via the switch it drops the session all the time making it unuseable."
2,You get what you pay for.,"A nice unit for the price, however, the video goes black quite often when the TV program switches between scenes. I am using this to funnel multiple HD signals to one old Sony Hi Def Rear projection TV at 1080i. I am hoping the >$200 units won't do this."
2,Very unprofessional,"I picked up this book on tape because I thought it would help me deal with some intense situations at work. I was wrong. The whole discussion was centered on Mrs. Arapakis' former boyfriends whom she described as losers and alternative lifestyle friends. She is obviously an unhappy woman and tries to push her victim perspective on other people. The idea of this book is basically ""Think what's good for you and act accordingly"". You do not have to listen through 4 hours of low level dating stories and pseudo scientific ramblings on relativity theory (I have PhD in physics and Mrs Arapakis' discussion of something she clearly does not understand really annoyed me). To summarize: do not waste your time listening to these tapes."
2,no better this time around,I somewhat enjoyed the first book but this sequel was hard to get through. It jumped all over the place and wasn't very entertaining. I think if the author would finish off the scenes alittle better it might of helped. I hope for the next book she put more effort into the flow of the story.
5,Superb,"' Ride the Wind ' is a superb book, whose author displays a warmth of sensitivy towards Quanah Parker's people, their rich culture, their way of life, which posterity has tended to nullify, indeed villify. Through Lucia St.Clair Robson's remarkable prose, it was not difficult for me to feel a part of their lives. I exulted with them over their joys; I felt saddened in their times of sorrow. An excellent experience, ' Ride the Wind ' was like a breath of fresh air sweeping over the plains, bringing together the earth, man and animals into a common heritage, each drawing on the other's strengths, capitalising on each other's weaknesses."
5,Very interesting read,Enjoyed reading this book. Took it on vacation with me and could not put it down. Learned a lot about the ways of the Indians.
3,Tried to lose a little weight.,As with all these products there is a shot that it would work.I didn't lose any weight but didn't gain any either.
1,Don't know what I'm doing wrong,"Despite following directions, I never could get this to bond properly. Heating the part, not the rod, it took forever to get the rod to melt, and then it didn't stick even if i cleaned it. Back to JB Weld!"
2,Not That Good,"There is nothing special about this album.Because five of the songs are on Victims Of Deception,then the rest of the songs are cover songs besides In Memory Of.You have Hellbound on this album which is off Victims Of Deceptin and that song sucks.I gave this album a two star because Hypnotized,Opiate Of The Masses,Timeless Cell and Mercy Is No Virtue are good songs and all of those songs are on Victims Of Deception.If you like thrash buy Breaking The Silence and Victims Of Deception by Heathen.Breaking The Silence is their best album.Don't buy Recovered."
1,1 CENT and still too expensive,"I bought this after reading some positive reviews and looking at the 1 CENT price tag. Sorry to say that even that price is too high. I can see why there are many cheap copies for sale. After one listen this has been tossed. I can still use the case and the cd will make a coaster, but I will certainly not listen to this again. A most horrid attempt at BLUES / ROCK, that is soooooo cliche as to be painful. Not one redeeming feature. Bad songs, bad playing - save your money."
3,poor serviced,The product is fine. The fact that I ordered it in mid December as a Christmas present and didn't receive it until mid January was very frustrating to me. I have heard of similar instances of this regarding items ordered over Amazon and do not intend to use Amazon for my ordering again.
4,Great to avoid common mistakes in starting you business,Great foundation for new business owners. The advice provides really good insight. Beneficial to save you from common mistakes in business.
1,ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!,"I can't remember the last time I was so disapointed in a book. Weak-willed, wimpy Emily Ravenscroft is the most pitiful, spineless excuse for a heroine that has ever graced the pages of any Janyne Ann Krentz novel I've read. Jacob Stone the hero (I use the term very loosely) must have used the phrase ""It's for your own good"" 50 times. I've rarely found a character with so few redeeming qualities. He was at once condecending, over-bearing, and so self-riteous I had trouble even finishing the book. The only thing that kept this reader turning pages was that I just KNEW Emily was going to show some backbone sooner or later. I was wrong. Time after time Emily almost spoke up for herself only to back down. I won't even get started on Emily's annoying relatives. All in all I will definately think twice before wasting my money on another of Ms. Krentz's novels. It's only too bad a zero star rating wasn't an option."
1,Doesn't hold up!,"I saw these on a program that was show-casing wedding gifts. I usually cook baked potatoes in the microwave and this product promised to cook a potato in 5 minutes. After about 1.5 minutes, the potato did start getting soft..however the prongs aren't long enough to continue to hold it up. I then put the feet on the potato, so that it was resting on it's side. It still would not hold. Potatoes were rolling all over my microwave. It still took 15-20 minutes to cook the potatoes!"
2,More weak sauce,"Like the Now ""Energy"" Capsules I just reviewed as being pretty weak, same with these. I got better results with GNC's Guarana capsules for about the same cost - will go back to them - thought I'd try something new, but..."
5,A real true action hero thats terribly overlooked,"Unlike today where someone achieves fame because they sing or act in front of a camera, Simon Kenton became famous due to his ferocious courage and almost nonhuman ability to withstand savage physical torture and abuse. He truly was an action hero. If Hollywood would creat a film ""in truth"" about this mans incredible life, it would be a monumental achievement whose only counterpart could only be the life of Tecumseh."
5,The Frontiersmen is the most remarkable book I ever read!,"A former friend loaned me his cherished, well-worn copy of this book over 20 years ago. Then he disappeared after I loaned him $500. I never saw him again, but the book has been worth more than the money to me. I have read it and re-read it - loaned it to family and friends. Everyone who picks it up can't put it down, and they all end up (mercifully) returning the book with comments like, ""Thats one of the best books I ever read!"" Thank you Mr. Enger, for the gift of the book. Keep the $500."
3,Good reading for a history buff.,Good.... but how to follow sometimes. Just not a smooth read. But I would still recommend it to anyone who enjoys history.
3,The author deserves a better editor,Did anyone even proof read this? The author has turned out an excellent book. It deserves better treatment by his publishers.
4,Not everything I expected,"I must admit, I'm not as crazy about this book like everyone else seems to be. I gave it four stars for the beautiful photos, and descriptions.But I think some things could be improved. The index lists everything by page number, which is fine if you're just leisurely looking through the book. But if you're looking for one particular outfit, it would be much more convenient to have an alphebetical listing. I wouldn't mind seeing the price guide broken down to include each individual accessory, since many people put together a complete set, piece by piece. But the thing that REALLY bugs me is that she almost always adds the word 'doll' after their names. For example, 'On weekends, Ken doll liked to take Barbie doll for a drive...', or 'Francie doll was excited about...'. Very annoying, to me, anyway. But, overall, it's a very good book to have."
4,Well...it was direct to video/DVD,"While not up to the high standard of the original Slap Shot, SS2 is a good addition to any Hockey (or Hanson Bros.) fan&#65533;s collection. Seeing the Hanson&#65533;s back on the ice is worth the price of the DVD on it&#65533;s own. At times the movie seems almost formulaic, copying some of the better scenes from the original, but accepting this as paying tribute to one of the greatest hockey movies of all time, we can let that go.The four out of five stars rating is based on those of us who love the original Slap Shot, so if it was not your cup of tea, you will want to give this movie a pass."
1,Shocking,"It gets one star because you can't give it any less. Truly, woefully poor. What were they thinking of? Leave this alone and watch the original at least 20 times."
1,Completely [bad],If you are a true hockey fan and someone who can recite the original Slap Shot word for word here's some advice... hide all sharp objects while you watch Slap Shot 2 because you may kill yourself.Slap Shot 2 painfully goes out of it's way to recycle all the brilliant lines of Slap Shot 1 into a ridiculous script. I almost put my foot through the TV on several occasions.It is arguably the worst sports movie ever made and anyone associated with it should be ashamed of themselves. Only rent it if you're curious how bad it could possibly be... but rent a second movie that you can watch after you throw Slap Shot 2 out the window after ten minutes.Actually what may be fun is get a group of people together... that way you can at least take pleasure in yelling at the TV every time something stupid happens (and trust me... you have no idea what you're in for... you can't even imagine how [bad] this movie gets by the end). Slap Shot 2 is [very bad].
1,Unholy travesty,"This movie accomplishes the impossible: it makes Caddyshack 2 look like The Godfather Part 2. A complete waste of celluloid. Stephen Baldwin is at his absolute worst (which is saying something) as a washed-up ex NHL star who is now playing for and coaching our beloved Charlestown Chiefs. The Hanson Brothers are still on the roster, apparently so the team can meet the league quota for 50 year olds. I don't want to ""ruin"" the ""plot twists"", so you'll have to sit through it to find out. Must be seen to appreciate how god-awful it is. Gary Busey zombie-walks through his role as a right-wing media mogul who purchases the team and moves them to Nebraska. In a movie full of imposibilites, the most riduculous event is the hot female coach falling for Baldwin, who looks and acts like a complete dork throughout the entire movie. Don't purchase this piece of garbage, rent it instead. If you're a fan of the original movie, avoid this at all costs, unless you also enjoyed Blues Brothers 2."
4,Slightly harder on batteries than other sets.,"Although performance is good, the need to renew batteries more often hampers the reliability and dependability of the product. its controls are easy to use and reception is very good."
3,Good but not perfect,"What other reviewers have said is true:- It's a battery hog- Often confusing controls- Disappointing AM receptionBut for someone who needs a portable AM/FM unitwith an external speaker, this is probably amongthe best that you can buy at this price."
2,Hard to finish.,"Of all the books on Bigfoot that I have read, this one was probably the most boring. He went from one account to the other without any thoughts of his own on the accounts. I like reading other peoples accounts but in this book it was almost like reading the same stuff over and over again. I think anybody can write a book by taking the words of others and putting them on paper without much input of your own and this is what I believe this is."
4,"Not an encyclopedia, but it is handy!","I'm not sure what the 1-star reviewer's problem is. Who wants to wade through MAN pages for hours? The whole reason I buy books is to compile the information in one handy place. This is a useful source to fill in general holes in your knowledge. If you already know this stuff cold, I'm not sure why you'd be interested in the book at all (either to praise or pan.) Bottom line: good, general book for those who want to bootstrap themselves."
2,Green Line,"I purchased this 42"" plasma HDTV in January 2008. Not long after I started to use it, a thick, vertical, green line, slightly left of center of the screen, would appear infrequently, and for very short periods of time. I would tighten the connections thinking that maybe when I was cleaning they were loosened. However, for the last couple of days, the line appears as soon as the tv is turned on, and does not go away. I searched the internet, and sure enough, this is a rampant, well-known defect of the Panasonic plasma panel. I tried to contact the plasma conceirge that Panasonic provides its high end plasma customers. For well over an hour all I got was a busy signal. I finally sent a tech support request online at their website. We shall see if I get a response. I paid $1500 for this tv, and I now know it was defective right out of the box. I hope Panasonic does the right thing. I will keep you posted."
1,Panasonic TH-42PZ700U is the worst plasma ever!!,"I purchased two Panasonic TH-42PZ700U in September 2007 through Amazon. Within a month one of the two Panasonic TH-42PZ700U started to display green lines in the tv. I have tried all kinds of fixes including download solutions which you can run from your PC to the tv, but nothing has worked. The other Panasonic TH-42PZ700U no longer turns on. As I don't live in the United States, I had to take it to a local delaer and found the the SC board was broken. The board costs about a $1,000 so it is not worth replacing and Panasonic won't help as I am not in the United Stated. Lets see I brought 2 Panasonic TH-42PZ700U plasmas and both do not work in less than a year. With all my research before buying 3 Plasma's only one is still working and it is NOT the Panasonic TH-42PZ700U. Stay away from this tv at all costs!!"
5,Love it! Great picture and all reviews said it would be!,"Still learning its features but out of the box it was easy to setup. Consumer Reports says this set has a great picture indeed it does. Looked at Vizio, Sony and more as well this one gives the best picture and sound for your dollar. We've had it a few weeks now and I am getting anxious for a Panasonic BluRay player to accompany it. The HD channels are delightfully sharp and even the old channels look better. Have a standard DVD player but it is so clear you'd swear it was HD... why I haven't rushed to get a BluRay just yet."
2,a little too thin,"Look for good stuff not problems. Ask people what they think is going well and let the group decide what to do with that information. There you have the book. Not sure where other reviewers are finding so much practical content. This is probably an excellent business practice but not a very good book about it. Anything i decide to do with this will have to come from my imagination or a more detailed resource. To be fair the author's stated purpose is to help you decide whether to dig deeper elsewhere but you can get that from these reviews. If you will need some other book anyway, why waste money on this one?"
2,I was disappointed,"There are some useful nuggets, perhaps, but on the whole I was happier with material I found on the web."
5,Helps Create Possibilities,I use this book in my coaching business. The book is a great source of usable information that can be easily understood. Hammond includes tips that can help shift one's thinking in a positive way. If we could all operate in the manner she describes we would be better leaders (at any level).
1,Sorry Movie,"One of the worst black movies I have ever seen. A so-called tough hair stylist. This movie was not even worth the time invested to order it. let alone to watch it. Poor plot, aimless direction. Not in par with the great movies during the blaxploitation era I grew up in. Don't waste the money or the time watching this poor excuse of a movie."
3,good,well my opinion is that the shoe it was not what I expected and again as well the product revisare thanks ..
5,Great DVD Set...,"This DVD set covers Dream Theater through the recording of I&W; thru the Falling into Infinity tour. Obviously, if you are a die-hard DT fan, you already have this.But if you are like me, you probably discovered this brilliant band only a few years ago. I got into this band when they released 6DOIT. Awesome album, by the way. But If you are just getting into this band, this DVD set is an excellent place to start. You'll learn a lot of things about this band's history throughout the 90's, like lineup changes, the rigors of touring, and such. Both discs have commentary by the band, which gives further insight into the footage.A MUST HAVE FOR ANY DT FANATIC!!!"
5,Tovolo Star Ice Pop Molds,"I received the pop molds, however, there wer only 5 included in the package. There is no phone number for me to call, nor does it make sense to pay for the return of this item because of its low cost.I would like to k ow who takes care of incomplete packages such as this.Thank you"
4,Kids love them,These are a great alternative to store bought popsicles. You can freeze any kind of juice to mix it up for the kids. They just love them.
2,Would Have Been Okay,"I bought this for my daughter and it's sweet and works well, but one of the sticks is missing. Otherwise, would have given it a higher mark."
3,Health Help or health threat?,"I was very disappointed to find out that this product is made in China. Given all the headlines about poisonous items originating in China, the lack of honest oversight there, and no knowledge of the seller Tovolo's practices if any to test the quality and safety, I remain nervous about the molds. In terms of design, I like them. I like that they are individual, come with a stand for the freezing period, and can be washed in the dishwasher. I wsh I could feel confident about my family's safety as I use them."
3,Does not fit every fridge,"These ice pop molds were too high did not fit into one of my fridges, and barely fit in the other. Both are bottom freezers with drawers. If you have a side-by-side or other freezer it could work fine, but best to measure ahead if not."
2,Too high and sticks pull out!,"I have the same problem as another reviewer: these are too high for bottom freezer drawers, I made yogurt lime pops and the sticks pulled out, leaving the pop in the mold every time. I will use my Dremel to cut ridges into the sticks in hopes that they will grab better. These popsicle molds need redesigning, I like the idea of BPA free plastic.u"
3,I am disappoint.,"Fun game, but loses its appeal very soon. I could play the first three from start to finish, but this game, I never got pass disc 1. Let a friend borrow it, and he lost the second disc. So, oh well. CBF to buy this again, unless i see it at a local gamestore or something."
2,Falls short on directions and completeness,"We have used the LP guide for a cycling trip in Provence and were very happy with it. The Ireland guide, though, falls short.Generally, small-scale maps were detailed enough, regional maps are ok, but there is an intermediate level of detail that you'll need for driving or cycling that just isn't there. And the written instructions don't fill in the gaps, the worst case being ""about 5 km south of city center"". I recommend you do map searches of all the places you must hit (attractions and lodgings) ahead of time, and print your own Google-type maps. Given that roads and streets are poorly marked in Ireland, the guide should spend a lot more space on directions - preferably as maps.There darned well ought to be a Dublin transit map in the guide, and there isn't.The restaurant listings tend to hit the highlights; they are far short of complete.In all, it was ok but this guide isn't as good as the other that we've used."
2,Kindle edition useless for actual travel,"I was pretty proud of myself for planning to go ""all Kindle"" for my upcoming trip to Europe. What I mean is, instead of buying the dead tree edition of this book, I just clicked the ""download to iPad"" button and thought I was good to go. The night before the trip I took a second, closer, look at the contents of this ebook. OK, the text is not as nicely laid out as in the paperback editions that I'm used to. But the real deal killer was the maps. They are all crappy: Low resolution, pixelated and hard on the eyes. Some maps are readable anyway, but some (for example ""Greater Dublin,"" location 2135) are blurry and completely illegible. And the whole-country color map, always found on the inside cover, doesn't seem to be present at all.I have no opinion on the contents of this book yet. I'll let you know after I buy the paperback edition and take it on the road. I guess the future hasn't arrived yet ..."
3,Boring.,I do not recommend buying this book if you intend to visit Earth's most beautiful country. I would consider the DK series instead - it offers far more comprehensive information on traditional and cultural issues.
5,Just Be/g Honest!.........,This tea is delicious but honestly the price is too high because I brought 1/2 pound for $2.50 @ a store on Broadway in NY which I was very surprised. I ask the retailer if it was the correct price and was told yes. He said that I could probably find it cheaper being that their store was located in the city. My fiancee luvs it because she says that its good to lose weight............
5,My favorite tea.,"I am just an out and out fan of this tea. Incredibly well balanced, and a nice complement to most any light meal."
5,Nickel-Silver Brazing rod,"Teamed with a MAP gas torch, a handy way for an occasional repair of small fab job by a handyman or home owner. Great for infrequent small jobs, but an expensive way to buy brazing rod. Much cheaper when purchased from a welding shop in 1 lb (or greater) quantities, but great for an infrequent need or small job."
1,Unbelievably bad,"One need only listen to Dolly's absolute abomination of Blowin' In the Wind to realize this is possibly the worst record of covers in existence. I love Dolly and I love the songs, but the combination is just awful. This CD should never have been made."
1,disappointing,"Oh, I was so disappointed. I'm a big Dolly fan, but honestly this cd is the worst I've ever heard from her. With only two exceptions, the songs didn't ""fit"" her. Perhaps it is that my ears are accustomed to the original artists, but the songs were just done terribly. I would never buy this cd again, but it won't stop me from buying other Dolly music!"
5,Deserves 10 stars!!,"This is Dolly at her finest. I did not realize until it arrived today that she was singing with some of the original artists. What a great surprise and delight! I have to say my favorite (all time favorite song) on the disc is ""Those Were the Days"" because of the great memories it brings back. Dolly has never sounded better and her Bluegrass twist on some great classics will make this a classic."
3,Dolly Parton - 'Those Were The Days' (Sugarhill) 3 1/2 stars,"Keep in mind that this is the very first ever country music release I've EVER reviewed.A friend of mine dared me to do so,need I say more?As for a CD full of '60's rock and folk covers,I personally thought that Dolly did pretty good.Tunes I dug the most were Dylan's ""Blowin' In The Wind""(didn't think she could tackle it,but I was wrong),Cat Steven's ""Where Do The Children Play?"",Tommy James&The Shondell's ""Crimson And Clover"",The Byrd's ""Turn Turn Turn"" and John Lennon's ""Imagine"".After hearing the disc a second time,I'm convinced 'Those Were...' is to be a special treat for her long time fans."
3,Helpful but Not the Answer,"It has been several months since we started using Dr. Whitley's program. After a month or so, our son became increasingly impatient with our calm questioning and was making no progress. While we still use the calm, methodical approach to communications with our son, we dropped the more structured questioning. Our son has been dianosed twice with ADD by psychiatrists. He refuses to accept the diagnosis or medication, and we discuss these issues with him in the calm manner suggested by Dr. Whitley. However, Dr. Whitley's program is not going to result in better grades for our son if the problem is physiological. Dr. Whitley does a disservice to parents by not at least mentioning the possibility that underachievement can have a biological cause."
5,Passing the Flame,"I purchased the book in June of 2003. I learned more in the first week about making lampwork beads than I had in four years previously. I do not have access to classes and have to depend on what I can find in books and the internet. The book is worth every penny I paid for it and consider it my best resource for both inspiration and instruction.Since I make a completely different kind of bead than those illustrated in the book, I feel that makes the book even more important as a teaching source. The instructions give you everything you need to make beads and be creative. I also have all the suplements and look forward to each new issue."
3,"Pricey, but our little girl loves them.","The magnets could be stronger, but I prefer these to the smaller plastic ones you can get anywhere."
2,"An incredible tale, poorly written.","The fact that the Chunnel is in operation today has to be one of man's greatest achievements. The story of the construction of the tunnel itself is amazing, but the entire history and the efforts of the companies, governments, and individuals is even more incredible. However, the book itself is did not do this story justice. I found it very difficult to follow both chronologically and factually. The book jumped around in time which made it hard to distinguish how things took place. There were so many characters not germaine to the project that it was hard to keep the names of the people involved straight. I found that without diagrams or illustrations, the explanations of the construction and engineering was difficult to comprehend, and I am an engineer. I understand there may be a video, I suggest renting it instead!"
3,pretty but...Sent it back!,"I thought the lights were solar powered but they are not. I guess this is my fault for not reading the description close enough. I did not want a cord all the way across my patio. This unbrella comes with no instuctions. It is easy to figure out to operate it, however it would have been easier with instuctions. On the bright side, this is a very atractive umbrella for a great price if you don't mind having a cord across your patio."
3,"power brick is marked ""INDOOR""","I was very disappointed to see that the power brick on the power cord is marked for indoor use only. This makes no sense on an outdoor umbrella.The umbrella tie is not sewn on, so you have to store it somewhere when the umbrella is open.The umbrella itself seems nice, but I am disappointed in the power strip and the tie. TropiLight needs to improve its quality."
5,Lighted Umbrella,"I love my umbrella!! The lights put out a beautiful amber glow. I received it on time, as promised and would recommend to eveyone."
3,"Good Umbrella, thin fabric","The umbrella is sturdy, lights look cool and the crank works great. The fabric is too thin and ripped after 2 years. No info on how to replace the fabric."
5,Good deal under an umbrella,Arrived quickly and seems like it will do the job. Have not tried the lights yet - probably in the spring.
4,Good but...,"This book needs an index with thumbnail pix. The book also could have included charts. Also I found it a bit boring with all swatches in the same color.Overall, I am satisfied with vol 1 & 2, although a little disappointed with #3."
4,"Good, with some flaws","Bought this product to go along with my son's Thomas wooden railway set.PROS: Realistic and durable. Versatile - top piece can be removed and mountain still looks good.CONS: Although the top tunnel has enough clearance, the bottom tunnel has low clearance. If the mountain is placed over wooden track, some Thomas trains (Thomas, Annie, Clarabel) will pass through, but some others will get stuck. The generic wooden tracks the come with the set do not have the exact same measurements as Thomas track. The staight and curved pieces are slightly longer. The ascending piece is about 1/2 inch longer and 3/8 inch shorter than the Thomas equivalent. This may not affect the overall layout but the connections aren't as smooth. The ascending Thomas track actually works perfectly here.Overall, it looks good but ended up not using the bottom tunnel. It's reasonably priced compared to other Thomas accessories."
2,Cheap and Awkward,"This piece may be fine if you have very little track already or have the world's biggest train table. Otherwise, it is so cumbersome with very little going on. Not worth the space on our table as we have plenty of cooler things to build with. I was hoping it would be more versatile, but it is not. There is a back slope that takes up tons of space and has no track/opening that can be used. I returned it."
2,Depends on your definition of compatibility,"The hand cleaner dispenser is claimed to be compatible with many hand cleaner containers. But, almost all products from Permatex (including DL) come in containers that have no special attachment for the dispenser. So, you take off the top, flip the plastic tub of cleaner upside down, and poke a vent hole in the bottom (which is now on top). The tub just rests on the dispenser, which means that it's easily knocked off. Permatex claims that it doesn't leak, even though the vented, open-on-the-bottom tub is just sitting on the dispenser. Permatex does say that their 1-gallon tubs of cleaner have threads that actually screw on to the dispener. But, the only such thing I've found is Devcon Fast Orange in the Flat-Top Gallon container (23104). List price seems to be $40 - $50, and almost nobody carries it."
3,A good beginning,"This book is informative, but tends to state the obvious a little too much. It is a good beginning for people who know little to nothing about Distance Education. Some portions are interesting, while others are more boring than they need to be. It isn't the best resource for administrators. But for a beginner's text, it is adequate."
1,Poorly written and badly out of date,"I wish this text hadn't been chosen for my Foundations of Distance Education course (MS.Ed. program). It may have a 2012 copyright, but it's quickly apparent that while the copyright has been updated, the content has not been. I know technology is ever changing, but the technology covered in the book is out of date to the point of irrelevancy. I also didn't care for the conversational style used by the authors. It sometimes is a little condescending to the reader.If you're looking for an academic consideration of distance education, buy the far superiorThe Perfect Online Course: Best Practices for Designing and Teaching (PB) (Perspectives in Instructional Technology & Distance Education S.)."
1,Very leaky,Could not get the hose to stop leaking. Had to return the item and purchase another brand. Either a really bad design or faulty item.
1,Dexter's folly,I started this book two years ago but finally got discouraged with the manner in which Dexter created too many diverse elements and never really got them drawn together into a plot with any direction. Before I got to the end I decided it wasn't worth the trouble. I started it again recently and finally reached the point at the end where Morse sits down and begins explaining the entire mess to Lewis; admitting all along that even he is guessing most of the time!! To me the truth came when I realized it takes Morse 28 pages to try and reconstruct the mess.I was right two years ago; it's just not good enough to hold your interest.
3,Good Morse Book,This is one of the better Inspector Morse books. There is a seemingly impossible murder case (involving a truncated body) to solve and the crime investigator solves it with his typical sharp analytical mind.
4,american splendor,Nice comic book. Maybe sometimes the arts are a little bit overwhelming cause of lack of colors. But still ok.
5,OUTSTANDING AS ALL OF HIS BOOKS ARE,I just finished Last Heros and cant wait for the Secret Warriors. I have all of Griffins books excep for The Witness; The Investigators; The secret Warriors; and In Dangers Path. He is the Best Writer of all time as far as I am concerned.I did not know that he had written under so many names.I look forward to each new book.
2,Weak and disappointing,"As a fan of W.E.B. Griffin, I found THE LAST HEROS to be disappointing. It is supposed to be about the Manhattan Project. In fact it isn't a novel, it is just the introductory chapter of a novel-a very long introduction, with an intriguing premise, but it really doesn't get beyond that. I found the ""romance"" to be a shallow distraction. Apparently, Mr. Griffin had an idea for a novel, which he planned to milk into a series. Replace ""milk"" with ""water down"". Sorry, no more from me. Instead I'll re-read the Brotherhood Series."
3,Re-Cycled Pulp is Still Pulp,"I was very disappointed in this book. After having waited a couple of months for it, I found out that: a) it was a re-released book being sold at new hard-cover prices and b) the plot is so similar to his Argentina books. Finally, in so many of his books, I find myself rooting for the characters - i.e. McCoy, Pickering, Payne - but none of the characters herein are appealing. To sum up, a barely readable Griffin book."
4,Making Mantels,We were looking for information on coving a fifty year old painted brick fireplace with tile & wood. It had enough info to get us started with good ideas on how to lay the tiles around the opening and what to use on the old bricks. We are in the process of picking out tiles now. What we need is some free time to move on to complete the project.
2,Beware ineradicable gaps between tracks that should play seamlessly on mp3 download,"This is a review of the mp3 download. This is a beautiful recording marred by two second gaps between tracks that are meant to have continuous play between them. Bad show Amazon.Your downloads are usually fine, but with this and other symphonic/ tone poem recordings split into multiple tracks you have screwed up more than once. I stress again. The recording is highly recommended in and of itself, the mp3 download is marred by carelessness on Amazon's part."
3,Lacking current examples and photos,"This book has a very deep history of heating with wood and even delves into the history of fire. I too was very disappointed to realize that there were very few photographs. And, equally disappointing was a lack of discussion of modern day masonry stoves. There wasn't even any description or anything about the big beautiful masonry stove that is pictured on the cover.Its been helpful and informative in that I have now learned just how these stoves work and a bit of how they do not work."
2,Good taining tool,"I bougth a pair of swim paddles, before, and the new ones I got they didn't have the confortable wrist to finger strap, they have 2 very unconfortable straps that really hurt the wrist and the finger when you do the trainig, I wish I can find the really good straps for my new paddles.Thanks"
5,great buy,"steel is better than aluminum,it lasts longer,thats why i got it.great turn around,it came before the predicted time,great price,cheaper than other places..."
3,"Good for collectors, but not for samplers","For an introduction to Hofamann, this volume is not the best. They contain mostly his earliest recordings (1910 to 1920) and they make for difficult listening. VAI and Marston Records' volumes of remasterings of Hofmann's later playing has better audio and better linear notes."
5,King of the Big Band Era,As one who grew up during the Second World War I still have vivid memories of the Glen Miller big band sound; I will always associate his sound with the war and the feelings that went with living through that amazing time. My only contact with Glen Miller's band was through the radio broadcasts but radio was really big at that time and hearing him on the radio was a special moment for many Americans.If you enjoy the big band sound or if you simply enjoy Glen Miller's sound this movie features most of his best known hits and will provide pleasant music well presented. It also provides interesting insights into the life of a driven musician who was destined for greatness.This movie does a great job of capturing the excitement of the time and particularly the big band sound of Glen Miller. The movie is perfect for the entire family and promotes strong family values and love of country. I recommend it highly.
1,Not happy,Bought this for my husband . Love the movie but nowhere is there any indication that there would be Korean subtitles in the product info. Very distracting to have subtitles on the bottom of the screen and to me it was not worth buying. If I wanted a different language I would have looked for one. I wanted an American movie without subtitles.
1,Shameless piracy of classic film,I was looking forward to a faithful copy of an old favorite film. Insead I received an apparently pirated copy with asian language subtitles and misspelled names of the stars. Additionally I filed a complaint and never received a response from the vendor. Very unhappy with this purchase!!
2,Very disappointed and I paid $24.00 for it.,This movie has Foreign writing all over the bottom while you are trying to watch the movie. It is in very big writing and it ruins the movie.
2,Banging,"I like Ms. Uchida's work, especially her Mozart piano concerti, and I like Schubert and I thought this a safe bet but I couldn't get through it. In the first movement of D850, it seemed as though Schubert had written repeated accented chords and then filled in the interstices with scrimshaw, and with scrimshaw a bit unsure of itself at that. I was alway brought up short, thinking that we ought to get somewhere with this, but we didn't. It went on, more banging, more noodling, and more banging, until I ejected the disk and gave it away. Schubert doesn't normally require patience. If you want to live to be 150 in subjective time, try Philip Glass or that patience-trying ""Bolero.""Out of respect for Schubert, whom I don't know as well as some of the oher great Teutonic composers, I'll look around for another version. Perhaps it takes just the right pianist, like Liszt's ""Mephisto Waltz."""
2,poor reception,"I like the features and design. but what does that really matter if the reception is poor? I have a 1700 sqft home, and experience reception problems from one side of it to the other.I'm suprised and disappointed.First day of use and regreting the purchase already."
3,averge,"the price was good, but many missing features... things that i thought should be standard... guess have to buy a higher end model. oh well..."
1,Piece of Junk,"Owned the base unit & one handset for 8 months. About once a month the unit would stop working. Proceeded to unplug the unit and let sit for awhile then reconnect. Unit would be fine for another month then would have to repeat the process. This last time the phone would not function at all. Tech support could not figure out the problem. Was told someone would call me which of course never happened. Could never get in touch with tech support again, constantly on hold. Removed the battery & trashed the unit."
2,Not as good as expected...,I bought this game for my girlfriend when she was in the hospital and was not very impressed. I guess it just doesn't compare to playing the board game.Also it was a bit complicated to teach her how to play in the hospital.
3,Doesn't play regulation Scrabble.,"Doesn't accept a lot of words that are acceptable in regulation Scrabble. For instance ""za"" ""qi"" to name a couple. I've reported this the to manufacturer and they say they're sorry, but they don't have a fix for it. Their suggestion was that I return it to where I bought it. Nice! It's entertaining, but doesn't take the place of the real game."
5,Great Game,Great game - hours of fun. Even used in a pool on an air mattress on vacation. Very durable - Must get!
2,Oversexed and characters that are unsympathetic ruin the story...,"Warren Adler's ""Casanova Embrace"" is an overdone and oversexed book about 3 women and their lover, a Chilean in exile. At the beginning of the book, Eduardo the Chilean, is killed in an explosion, and a CIA man tries to piece together the who and whys of the murder. On the way, we meet three women that bore us to tears, and by the time we get to the part where they know they've been had, we don't care."
3,Rachel Field made this way too long,My mother had always told me how much she loved this story. I was prepared to read a wonderful book. I really enjoyed the first half of the story. It was entertaining and I was waiting for something to happen. I thought surely something grand would happen to the main character. The climax of the story was confusing and disappointing. The second part of the book was so boring. It was great that Rachel Field had such an interesting account of American history in her family but it just wasn't that interesting.
4,Interesting read,"I, too, remember the Bette Davis/Charles Boyer film fondly and was glad to find this novel so many years later. I have to agree with others that the second half of the book lacks the compelling interest of the first; Rachel Field was writing about her own family in the latter, and she would naturally be just as interested in it as she was Henriette's life in Paris. I enjoyed the look at New York in the mid-nineteenth century, but the second half of the book just wasn't as compelling. If it had been, I would have given this one five stars. Still, anyone who enjoys historical fiction laced with a bit of romance (not much romance, and somewhat old-fashioned, but sweet) will find much to appreciate in this book."
5,Northern Exposure...always a warm pleasure!,I like it..I like it a lot! The show is just a smooth and cozy pleasure!
3,Misleading Packaging,"Having just bought season 1 of Northern Exposure and it being presented in quirky zippered parka, I wrongly assumed that the 2 season set which looked as it were also packaged in this way. Instead we receice a cardboard sleeve with a photo of a red parka on it, that was quite misleading and dissappointing. If this was made clear I would have then just purchased the second season on its own to get the special parka. I only wanted these 2 seasons as they were the only ones to have original music. Not Very Happy!!!"
3,Not Very Family Friendly,"My husband and I watched this show when we were first married and ""thought"" we enjoyed it then. Now, about 15 years later,we found after watching it with two, teenaged sons, that the sexual content makes is unsuitable for us to continue viewing. Although thequirky, offbeat humor has given us a few laughs, we will not be purchasing any additional seasons."
3,Cute but not for Kids......,"This is a cute game but not at all appropriate for children. The &quot;Truth and Dare&quot; parts of this game are absolutely directed at adults, even if terribly cheesy. (&quot;Whats your favorite battery powered toy?&quot; &quot;Remove an item of clothing&quot; &quot;Sit on the lap of the person to the left of you until your next turn&quot;)My kids play it and we modify the dares but they are pre-readers so we can, fortunately, get away with it. Its wooden blocks, you stack them. Simple."
1,Not a novel idea,"My friends and I have been playing this style of Jenga for years with the original Jenga game. We would just take the blank pieces and write things on them, truths or dares. This version, I have played too, its too PG. Adults need to come up w/ more innovated questions that the ones provided for the game to be truly fun and interesting."
3,Not sure. I still get blue death screen which is related to memory,Company is good but may be i got bad stick. I need to do memtest to confirm the stick is bad.
5,This shampoo is awesome and smells so good!,"I have extremely curly hair and always have difficulty finding good shampoos. DevaCurl No-Poo has been a great find. My hair is much less frizzy, and the curls are much better defined. My scalp tends to be dry, but it is much better with this shampoo. The peppermint fragrance is really nice too."
5,Miracle in a Bottle,"If you have curly hair, this shampoo line by DevaCurl is a MUST HAVE. I have not tried the ""no poo"" yet, but I absolutely LOVE the low-poo! The scent is great, my hair and scalp are healthier than ever, and it's affordable! Tell your friends, too...they'll thank you!"
1,Wishing No-Poo had No-Smell,"I bought this product with high hopes, but the smell of this shampoo is so strong, it was really overpowering! It has a strong perfume-like smell that lingers on your head for hours. I only used it once. I am sorry I bought it."
4,No-Poo by DevaCurl,I enjoy the no lather effect from this product. This non-poo smooths my hair instead of tangling it all up.
2,Leaves feeling hair soft but greasy,It was sort of odd washing my hair with shampoo that doesnt lather. It doesnt feel like your hair is getting clean and it takes much longer to wash the product than regular shampoo. I found that this made my hair feel very greasy. It may have been because I didnt remove all of the product...it did make my hair feel really soft. But the bad out weighed the good here for me. I have very long curly/wavy hair.
4,Good reference work in need of revision,"This is a handy reference work, replete with essential details and fascinating historical information. It is, however, in need of revision, as, since publication, some nations have changed flags (e.g. South Africa), and others have gained independence (e.g. Eritrea, Belau)."
5,In the trenches for civil rights,An excellent account of life growing up and practicing law as the first black lawyer at Ground Zero of the voting rights movement. The book provides interesting insights into life in the South both before and after the cataclysmic events of the 1960's in Alabama. It also provides a unique perspective on the development of a law practice in a hostile environment.
4,Very useful,I love this resource. This book is extremely engaging. The children love reading this book which gives them some helpful reminders.
3,Book Review,"This book was ok but was wanting a little more detail. For the average reader it would be fine, but needed more depth and information for my taste."
3,Top notch popular history,"This won't be considered required reading for any students of Washington, but it was a great read nonetheless. It gives a great view into the infighting in the Continental Congress and the suffering of the soldiers at Valley Forge. As a resident of Wayne, PA (named for Gen. ""Mad Anthony"" Wayne) and living a stone's throw from Valley Forge National Park it was great fun to read about the history of the region."
5,Check your size first!,"Love the product, but I should have ordered one size larger! Of course, it could be that I'm so used to my older pair of zorries, thongs, sandles, flip-flops, whatever you wanna call 'em, I just need to wear these new ones in a bit! Nice and snug, so maybe it's just me! Nicely made and they look like they'll last for a long time! I LOVE the thick sole!"
4,Here's a tip I found at a site for problems with this phone,"I love this phone system but had a problem with one of the phones losing all functions. It would light up and show 12 noon for the time. Nothing else worked. I tried to de-register the phone but couldn't.The tip is from someone who called Uniden about this problem. She was told to hold the ""end"" and ""#"" buttons for about six seconds. This will de-register the phone and then you can re-register it. It worked for me! It works fine now.If I have any more problems I guess it would be a good idea to call Uniden. They just might have simple fixes for some of the other problems I've seen here."
4,Very sleek and modern phone,"My kids were delighted with all the great features this phone has. It rings in different tones according to caller, it has speakers attached to the handset which makes it very handy and there are two phones which is a lifesaver in a large household. I have had one slight problem with it twice where it won't let a call go through after it rings so I have unplugged it twice and then reset it and the problem corrects itself. I don't know if it is something with our line, jack or the phone itself but it has happened twice in the one month I have owned this phone. Otherwise no problem and very loaded with good features."
3,Uniden malfunctioned after 35 days,"I purchased the Uniden 8885-2 just over month ago. This morning, the base unit started to malfunction. ""Welcome - please wait"" flashes on the screen and I am unable to make calls with either handset even though they appear to be working fine.Both women I spoke to at Uniden tech support were helpful and polite. However, when they reached the conclusion that the base unit would need to be replaced, they asked where I purchased the phone. Amazingly, they said they will not honor warrantees for phones purchased through Amazon.com. They said they could not determine if the phone was a refurbished unit. Luckily, a supervisor corrected the situation and they will repair or replace the unit. Whew, rage subsiding.I have been mostly happy with the phone. The range is acceptable. The sound quality is usually good, although sometimes a can hear a very distracting echo. However, I hope that the replacement unit works longer than a month. We'll see..."
1,Great Features. Terrible Sound,"I had hoped this phone would be a winner, and I did find the features, and the sound quality of incoming calls to be superior. But when three of the first five people I phoned said the line sounded terrible, I knew it was a loser. I switched to another phone and everyone said I sounded much better. This search for a decent cordless/answering phone is more difficult than it should be and so many phones are hit or miss. I cannot recommend this phone and wish I could. I have returned mine for a refund."
3,Interference with Wireless,"I bought this phone and while I love the features this phone system offers, I am very disappointed that I find my wireless DSL router will disconnect when a handset is in use. I have never had any problems with my wireless router interfering with my cordless phone system until I upgraded to this model.Other than the interference, the features are wonderful! You can set distinctive rings for certain caller and the system allows you to transfer phonebooks to all the expansion handset. This really is a nice phone system with great clarity, yet still frustrating about the interference."
4,Great Gritty Children's Show,Marvellous to be able to get these DVDs some 45 years after seeing this original series. To watch them and actually recall some of the stories after so long is testament to their quality and how they burned into a child's memory.It comes from that great tradition of rather gritty entertainment showing ordinary lives with fairly believable story lines.Too late now to show my own children but hopefully these episodes will be enjoyed by grandchildren some day!
5,Excellent example of innocent times,"If you're a fan of The Andy Griffith Show, Father Knows Best, Rin Tin Tin, Lassie, & similar, you should buy Vols 1 & 2 of The Littlest Hobo. I remember seeing the series as a kid in California when it first aired back in the early 60s & still enjoy it. The sound & picture quality, on my tv/dvdplayer, was excellent & the only gripe I have is that the word ""scenes"" is used in the menu instead of ""episodes"". A ""Canadian thing"" perhaps? (LOL) Otherwise, money well spent &, depending on the age/maturity of your children, may well be as entertaining to them now as it was when you saw it originally."
3,ok case by gator,"I was worried about this purchase since it was 40$ cheaper than other hard cases. i think these cymbol cases are over priced for what they are. there banking on the fact that youre cymbols are worth 1000$ or more. the construction of this case is simple abs plastic just thick enough not to be thin. im not shure if it will hold all my cymbols by looks id say id be lucky to get 6 in there. theres no pads for inbetween the cymbols, ill have to make some. other than these negative comments id say, or hope it will do the job. i was tempted to return it, but then id have to spend more money for another case. ill keep it. also the add doesnt describe its made by gator and its called the light series."
4,compact and clean looking,This is a nice and compact clothes drying rack for lightweight items. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it can't totally replace a large floor rack for items like sweaters and such. It was very simple to install and seems to work well so far.
2,Not great quality,Received this item and the bar was bent. Just didn't seem very sturdy or great quality for the price. Thought it would be perfect for my mom's small laundry room but was disappointed and sent it back.
3,Widescreen Version Is Not Anamorphic,"Quality is OK but other Elvis DVD's are all ""Enhanced For Widescreen TV's"" e.g Jailhouse Rock. So why is'nt this one? This refers to 65096"
3,Viva Las Vegas - Blu-ray Info,"Version: U.S.A / Region A, B, CAspect ratio: 2.40:1VC-1 BD-25 / AACS / Advanced Profile 3Running time: 1:24:54Feature size: 16,74 GBDisc size: 17,95 GBAverage video bit rate: 20.42 MbpsDolby TrueHD Audio English 1455 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1455 kbps / 16-bit (AC3 Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps)Dolby Digital Audio English 640 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbpsDolby Digital Audio English 192 kbps 1.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbpsDolby Digital Audio English 192 kbps 1.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbpsDolby Digital Audio French 192 kbps 1.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbpsSubtitles: English / English SDH / French / SpanishNumber of chapters: 24#Audio commentary#Kingdom: Elvis in Vegas - Featurette (20 min)#Theatrical trailer"
3,Overhyped? You Decide.,"As much of an Elvis fan as I am, I can't help but think this is overhyped.It's an average type of musical, looks okay, songs average but take a deeper look and you will see cost cutting on a massive scale. Wobbly sets, a very sparse supporting cast, Elvis looks like Ken from Ken and Barbie with hair to match and Ann-Margret, who is not as popular or talented as she thinks she is, does a very average job - other actresses could have done a better job. After all, didn't he romance all of his leading women.This is viewed by many Elvisites as one of his best - just shows how bad the others are then!If you want to see what Elvis could really do on screen check out King Creole, Wild in the Country or even GI Blues if you want something more lighthearted."
5,Viva Las Vegas Deluxe Edition,I did not incur any problems and I received the product in a timely manner.
5,Viva Las Vegas,"Great movie and cast, disc in in very good condition.If you like Elvis and Ann-Margret, theis is the movie to see."
5,Ann-Margret practically steals the show!,"This is essentially a movie about two of the screen's most famous duos who never made another film due to Col. Parker's dislike of Ann-Margret and of the director having a very badly concealed crush on the actress. That said, this is one of Elvis' best films with production values more deserving of his talents. The songs are great and Ann-Margret practically steals the film. Whatta body! She just sizzles and burns her way into your memory!"
5,Elvis at his best,This is a great video . I enjoyed the interaction between Ann and Elvis.They displayed a lot of talent in this video.
4,about time,"its about time that they made a movie! Since this show went off the air in 97 the fans of Reboot have been waiting for an ending to this fabolous show, since none ever came out we've had to satisfie ourselves with writing fanfiction but, even through there will be a movie I do hope the fanficton will stay along with the wonderful Reboot related friendships that have been made."
2,READ THIS BEFORE YOU PURCHASE!!!,"As a fan of Reboot I was thrilled that I might see the entire collection. Although DVD's are sold as Volumes they only contain a few episodes. Not near enough to enjoy the true richness of the series. When I purchased ALL 4 volumes some even purported to be ""seasons"" I expected to get just that. Not 4 selected epsiodes from each year. I would have GLADLY paid more to actually get what I wanted. ..."
5,We couldn't hike without this book!,"I have lived in the Coachella Valley for 35 years and have never hiked until Mr. Ferranti's book came out. Even though I've lived here, my husband and I rely completely upon the hiking trails Mr. Ferranti expertly maps out! My son, who actually lives in the mountains above Palm Springs, is familiar with many of the Coachella Valley trails already, but ""100 Great Hikes in and Near Palm Springs"" never leaves his side! No one who wants to hike in the Coachella Valley should be without it! Thank you, Mr. Ferranti!!"
2,Vogue Crocheted Hats Book,"The reason why I don't like the book and it's not worth the money, especially the extra money it cost to order the book such as shipping and handling is because the instructions are not clear, twisted, and made overly complicated. I want to have fun making the projects from the book instead it's a book of head aches. Not worth the buy, in my opinion, you might get two patterns from the whole book that's not convoluted. Besides, because this book is so poorly written ""instructions"" I have found lots of wonderful hat patterns for crocheting and knitting on Youtube.com."
2,Book is a flop,"OK, I normally like books that review and give opinions on movies and books. Being a fan of quite a few works that she wrote on, I was disappointed. On the Labyrinth topic, she totally bashed on fanfiction. I agree that the original ending to the movie is fine the way it is, but she needs to realize that these people are just playing make believe, sorta like Sarah. I didn't agree with quite a few things that this writer proposed, but buy if you want to. My advice is don't."
5,Don't highlight while reading . . .,"or the pages in this enlightening little book will be wet with color. Instead of searching for insights in the thousands of books on marketing, branding and innovation, simply read - and reread this one. And then use those insights to grow your brand and to make a difference in other people's lives."
3,Judy moody predicts the future,It was a terrific book and i recommend it for everyone its a pleasure to read and good all around!
5,Judy Moody Predicts the Future,"Great series of books! Got this to go with my daughter's starter series, and she loves them all. Definitely recommend this series for young ladies!!!"
5,Freud 10 inch melamine blade,"Ordered this to complete a craft table project for a friend out of melamine coated particle board. With my normal blade on my table saw, I always got some chipping on the back side when cutting. With this blade, there was practically no chipping - very clean cut."
2,Edited Version of an Oversensationalized Account,"This version of the Jim Jones/People's Temple story was clearly produced to shock rather than document the story of what was already a terrible tragedy of human failing. And unfortunately as sensational and graphic as it already is, this DVD has had some of the more disturbing scenes edited out that I recall from watching it at the time. This is not noted on the case or description."
2,Out grown my hewlett packard,This camera was find for outdoor shots and works well for group shots. But after I tried a friends camera I could tell it is not nearly as good for zoom as her camera is. I beleive I need more zoom power and more mega pixels
4,Love it,"I have had this camera for a couple months. Have taken at least 400 pictures with it. The quality is great even on the least quality setting. I lost the battery door and had a replacement in 2 days with no charge. I am very happy with the response from HP. The batteries dont last very long if you use the monitor, but I find it easier to just use it like a standard camera. Then the batteries last a long time. Like anything else you have to give yourself time to get to know the camera. I used a 35mm SLR totaly manual camera for 30 years. I loved it but I realy like this c200 and would recommend it to anyone who like me couldnt afford a really expensive camera. Thumbs up on this one."
4,Great general use camera for the price,"I have used this camera for literally thousands of pictures. The batterly life is outstanding. I can usually get around 200 high resolution pictures or usually more on a set of new batteries. Downloading from the camera is the biggest energy drain. This is a great camera if you want pictures for websites or want to print standard size photos. There are only 2 drawbacks I have found. If you are indoors in a large building (say a church or cathedral) and the building is not very brightly lit, the photos will not come out very well. The flash is only good for small areas or close-ups. The second is that the high-res pics do out blow up well to print on an 8.5x11 paper or to use as wallpaper on your computer screen. Other than that, minor drawbacks in most situations, this is a great camera."
3,Beware of the extra expenses!,"A nice camera. since the other reviews list all positives, letme list the downsides of picking this otherwise-cool cameraup.1. Does not include an AC adapter. The HP adapter costs a fortune ($55). Buy a cheaper Sony 6v 700mA adapter as another reviewer notes...it'll do the same thing for about $20.2. Get NiMH batteries and a charger (Target carries these) otherwise you'll soon begin to hate this machine, especially if you download pics to your PC a lot.3. This one includes no carrying case. Consider the PDC 700 instead.4. This camera is a good quality HP one, but has a cheap plastic look to it. Alternatives in the same $ range include the Kodak DC215 for about $260"
2,Wasted Money,I bought this toy for my 4yr old and my 1yr old kept up with the balls and my 4yr old was bored to death the balls never came out fast enough and you can not play it on the carpet because it needs a hard floor. But the spinning of the balls would never push them out the holes fast enough if a 1yr old can catch them.
4,My Nephew Loves It,I purchased this gift for my 2 1/2 year old nephew. From my understanding he just loves the toy. While he isn't old enough to actually play the game - he is old enough to put the pieces into the bug and watch them pop out. His mom says it has provided much entertainment!
1,Save Your Money,"I ordered this book from Amazon because it appears on the recommended lists of many photographers. It is nicely written but is a photographer's meditations. The only one for whom it is meaningful is for the author. The reader is left wondering, What am I supposed to take from one pointless and brief observation after another? There is no depth, little insight, just words that sound good together. After reading a book like this, I wish Amazon would offer me a refund for time I spent looking for any substance here, not only the $."
3,Les Jeux Sont Fait,People who write about photography write about photography for people who write about photography. That was an old saying my Pappy used to tell me.
1,Defective Col Pac,"Upon receipt of the Col Pac Black Neck pack, the gel silica filling inside has hard and dried out.The pack was not soft and pliable like it is supposed to be. I am a long time user of Chattanoga ColPac so it was immediately apparent that this was defective. Wasted my time ordering, then having to box up to return!"
1,Horrible,Very old covers were shipped to me . Will never buy again from this seller. I had to take them as a giftbut I could not becoz of the quality . Very disappointed
1,V.H.S.,"When one go on the list stating , selling V.H.S. TAPE and you get a D.V.D.. Well I gest you NOT KNOW THE DIFFRINTS. Let me explain. D.V.D have one hole and thay are flat. Follow Me sofare. What I payed for is square and has 2 ( TWO) hole. I can only hope any one buy a tape from you , DON'T OPEN THE BOX, YOU'ELL BE SORRY. ARTHUR."
2,horrible,horrible. horrible distortion. No tone. Too much gain.I play with a bass amp so I expect a lot of tone from a pedal. Must have tone.For the ones that didn't find the review helpful. IT SUCKS-too much tone out of the guitar.Pay the extra buck and get a Metal Muff or a MXR FullBore.
4,"good book, helps to diagnose","If you has learned all neuroanatomy, this a good book to help understand the neuro diagnosis"
3,"Have only used it a few times, but I think it may work.",I sweat heavy and thus the issues with needing stronger deodorant. I'm finding the solution has to be two or three fold. This helps with the sweating.
3,Not a fan of Acropolis edition edited by Sinkler,"It would be much better to find a copy of the original Metaphysical Notes. If the new edition of this title by Martino Publishing is a copy of Metaphysical Notes (not edited by Sinkler), then it would be my choice over this edition. As I have suggested this title to many of my students over the years, it is a wonderful addition to your Goldsmith library after the initial books Joel suggested to students. You can find his list on the internet. You are in good hands with Goldsmith. Stick to the older books and you will feel the consciousness of this master mystic."
2,Bleak at best - Bleak at worst,"I wish I could have liked this book more, but I'm weary of bleak tales of growing up poor and Southern. It's not that I am unaware of the travails of families who lived off the land -- I come from people who lived in the backwoods and made it through the worst times of the Great Depression.I just don't want to read about their struggles over and over and over again.As to comparisons between William Gay and William Faulkner -- GET REAL! This guy can't even stand on Faulkner's porch. Faulkner may have created sentences that ran on for 3 pages, but he was smart enough to use punctuation, for heaven's sake.I guess the literary world is so desperate for quality these days that they'll latch on to anything different. In this case, however, different isn't necessarily better."
2,Cormac McCarthy rip off....,"The title is lifted from Cormac Mcarthy's 1973 novel, Child Of God. That book is far better than this one.William Gay, a talented writer, does not speak with his own voice. Anyone who has read McCarthy's novels will find that Gay is speaking through McCarthy and has not found his own style.A good book if you have never read anything by McCarthy. If you have, you will find the writing here inferior."
4,Buy it!,I love this author! There is nothing out there like him. The best thing I can say is buy it!
3,starts out slow,"It took me awhile to get through the first half of the book. The second half was much better. I'm not sure how much I care for this series. I just can't figure out why some of the characters do the things they do. I hope everything is answered in the final installment, but I have my doubts."
3,Product is great - seller is not.,"I had this product for my older kids when they were younger and they loved listening to the tape while flipping through the books. Books are cute, solid and easy to follow along with. However, I bought this set for my 1 year old for her birthday and it arrived with no tape. For $44 - I expect exactly what I paid for and am very dissappointed that the tape set was advertised but not provided. Won't use this seller again."
4,Very fun trio of music and imagery!,"A friend recommended this to us. The tape's music is very fast, so it's not ideal for children to listen to the tape and look at the book at the same time. They would miss too much of the book. After I learned the tune, it's better to sing slowly, so the kids can take in all the pictures. There's a lot of fun illustrations and details, so my son loves ""reading"" the books over and over again. We bought this when my son was 1, and he's nearly 2 now, and still is enjoying the trio of books."
1,I just can't finish it...,"I rarely give up on books. When I was reading the Mists of Avalon, I got so angry at one point in the book I quit reading it. A couple months later I picked it back up and finished it, and now it is one of my favorites books. I learned my lesson, always finish the book, you just never know how it will end up. I have tried reading this book, but I just can't finish it. It doesn't keep my attention. While you're reading it you realize that the storyline and plot should make for a very interesting book, but it just doesn't seem to work. I don't feel a connection to any character, they feel very superficial to me. If I ever get around to finishing it, I may come back and update this review, but that day seems to be far away."
3,"Nice item, but way too big!","We received this car seat from our registry, and were really excited about it. However, we found that if you cannot place this seat in the middle of the backseat, it does not fit! We have tried this seat in four different vehicles, everything from a full-size quad cab truck to a small car, and it did not fit well in any of them!If this is for a first child, or you own a vehicle with third row seating, I would recommend it. For us, needing two car seats, it just didn't work."
3,Faucets Included????,"We're very interested in purchasing this item. Do the faucets come with it? There's no mention of faucets, so we assume they do not. There's no way to ask. The ""Contact Us"" link on Baths From the Past sight doesn't work."
1,Doesn't Work,This doesn't do any good to boost your cell phone signal. I tried one of these and wasted my money. I am not sure if it worked for others but it did not work for me and my friend.
1,Waste of money..,"I get bad reception in my apartment and bought this hoping it would help, but unfortunately it doesn't not give me better recepetion AT ALL."
1,Not recommended,I bought this product because I was getting a 10% signal on my HTC Touch Pro in my office. The signal didn't improve at all after installing this stick on antenna. I will not recommend buying this product.
3,Not Battery operated,This is advertised as battery operated. It has a cord and is an electric strobe light. Can not return because I needed it too soon!
2,"OK, so I'm 30+ years late...","As a second-wave feminist (that's what they tell me, anyway) who was about 10 when FE was published, I've always been curious about it, particularly the title. I finally found a copy and eagerly dove in. Big disappointment, for two reasons.First, I couldn't wrap my head around that title. It drove me crazy: It should have been called Woman as Eunuch.Second, as a cultural icon and journalist, I expected much more from Greer's writing. It would never fly today: heavily anecdotal, sweeping generalizations with no backup data, no citations to anyone or anything. To illustrate that girls are overprotected, she cites the ""case"" of a girl using her last dime to call her mom for a ride home, and then being left with no bus money. Huh? This is supposed to prove that girls are overprotected?I gave it 150 pages, then quit. Not only did she not have anything new to say, what she said was said poorly. Sorry, Greer. I'll just have to be a feminist without you."
1,A truly troubling book,I bought this for a Women's Studies class and the only good thing I can say about it is that it's base text (once you get past the bits and pieces of transmisogyny in the front matter) is that it's not very trigger-laden. The only good thing about dropping the Women's Studies class that required this book is that I get to return it for full cash value. ^_^
4,"Not the YLT album to start with, but....","The critics have not been so kind to this one, but, as other reviews note, it is an important album for YLT, and has at least two classics (""Detouring America with Horns"" and ""Satellite""). ""Inside-Out"" is one of their best pop efforts, too. The rest is more problematic. ""Sleeping Pill"" is not a good extended YLT instrumental, and while ""Mushroom Cloud of Hiss"" starts off as a great punky rant, it's ruined partway through by an extended all-feedback squeal. Mind you, this is an all-time favorite for me, but if you're looking for your first YLT album, you are hereby directed to ""Painful"" and ""Electr-o-pura."" If you're looking to fill out your collection, however, there is good stuff here."
2,"love the band, hate this album.","Its an earlier album that instead of hinting at the genius to come, rather shows weaknesses in the genius that did."
3,Not as great as expected :(,"I bought the Fiesta Sanuk on amazon after being extremely happy with another pair of sanuks I own. Though I desperately wanted to love this pair too, I wasn't nearly as happy with what I received in the mail. The colors of my Sanuk fiesta are not the same as depicted in the picture; I was expecting bright colors, but the pretty blue is actually an ugly shade of brown :( Also an unattractive crease has already formed in the cloth on the surface of the shoe, right under toe level. Plus my feet get sweaty in these very fast unlike my other sanuks, so I'm not very happy. Other than all that, they are still a relatively cute pair of shoes and they're comfy so I don't think I'll return them. I still say the pictures are misleading though, so just watch out!"
4,very comfy shoe but one little problem,"all around great shoe! they are very comfy and i have gotten alot of compliments on them. the only downside is that they slip off my foot a little bit when i walk thus giving me many ""flat tires"". (yes i bought them in a right size, they just naturally slip off a little) great shoe! pricey perhaps but a rad, laidback shoe nonetheless"
5,Most comfortable shoes my daughter has ever worn!,According to my daughter these shoes are awesome! They are the most comfortable shoes she has ever worn. She's already requested another pair for Christmas.
5,G-Mo Is The Truth,"Finally!is all I can say about this CD,I have been looking for this CD forever partically for 1 song It's An Everyday Thing To Roll.I first heard this song when I was 11 at a skating rink,at first I did not know who the rapper was until a friend told me and I had been searching for that song ever since I first heard it and now that I finally have it I'm so happy and it brings back good memories for me so Thanks Amazon.com!"
3,Great Book (not the best condition),"This book was great and had all of its pages, but it had very noticeable wear and tear on the front and back cover."
5,inquisitive mind!,Very well written. Brings up questions everyone has asked at some time or another. Answers keep the reader wanting to find out the response to the next question.
1,UNBELIEVABLE,"UNBELIEVABLE!! I expected paying $8 for a ""jumbo"" coloring book, I was going to receive a really thick coloring activity book.. WRONG!! I could have purchased a bigger coloring book at The Dollar Tree.. WHAT A MAJOR RIPOFF!!!!!"
1,Size is Way Off,"I have a 20"" rim on the front of my TourEasy and have used numerous tires from various manufacturers over the past 6 years (about 2 per year). Some have fit better than others, but this KWest arrived and is at least 2-3 inches too big (diameter). It is imprinted as a 20"" tire, but it isn't. I'm out $10 for shipping since BikeSomeWhere doesn't honor prime shipping. I read positive reviews, so perhaps they do OK on the more common sizes, but to smaller tires, AVOID KENDA!"
2,Deceptive,"Spoiler alert: I thought my wife and I were, at the recommendation of a friend, in for a good romance movie. Then, way into the story, we find out that the boss guy who has been trying to get the star's attention, is married. Turned it off right there. That tells you how weak the story was up to that point."
1,Description Deceptive,"I would never order anything else from Firefly Buys, as they have quoted to me over the phone that they do not care how innacurately Amazon posts descriptions of their items, it is not their responsibility. Whatever. I received this doll expecting it to be much smaller because the description says the doll measures 12 inches tall. Well it does not. For that matter, the doll doesn't even stand, but you won't find that little detail in the description either, at least not for the Sasha doll. Of coure this means that in order to return it I have to pay for shipping AGAIN, thus paying more for shipping than I paid for the doll. Since this is their idea of customer service, they can keep their merchandise because I would never buy from them again and I would not recommend them to anyone."
5,The Best Gets Better.......,"After using my old 14.4V Makita for years (and it's still going strong with the new Lithium Ion batteries), I purchased this combo for my son recently. Love the lights on the Hammer drill and the driver seems to be strong. All in one case a big plus also. The only downer is that it is his set and not mine."
3,Wine making in a readable form,Easy to read and understand but what's missing (which I had to create) was a process flow diagram showing the steps and how much of what to input at various steps (much had to be inferred from various sections of the book).
1,Crazy fan saddened by this compilation,"The Cocteau Twins are one of my all-time favorite bands. I regret to inform interested listeners that this compilation is really meant for the hard core fan. Even then, it's mainly a collection of live performances. If you've seen the Cocteau Twins live, you know that their sound is difficult to reproduce live. I have been a fan from the beginning and I understand the fundamental movement indigenous to innovative labels like 4AD. If you are seeking something to sink your teeth into, try Blue Bell Knoll or Heaven or Las Vegas. These two CDs offer two distinct, yet equally compelling periods within the Cocteau Twins experience."
3,Live jibe erroneous,"I have to take issue with ""A music fan from San Diego"" regarding the Cocteau Twins live. I saw them in Manchester (U.K.) in 1994, and it was the best concert I had ever seen in my life up to that point (bested the year after by the Stones).As for the music contained herein, it is early Cocteaus, and, therefore, a little more coarse than later works. But Garlands, Sugar Hiccup, Dear Heart speak of the wonders to come, and Musette and Drums must be considered classic semi-instrumental by anyone who can respond to beauty in powerful, rhythm-driven, music (equivalent to the blissful Me In Honey, on R.E.M.'s Out Of Time).I totally agree with ""San Diego""'s in respect of Heaven Or Las Vegas - one of the most emotive albums I've ever experienced, and along with Victorialand the best of the Cocteaus (thus far!)"
2,not very helpfull,"I purchased this CD (and book) to listen to while I was rehabing a house to rent out. I was expecting a turn key guide - I just didn't get that from this CD or the book. This book and CD had some good info but not detailed enough for me - a lot of very high level, very basic, common sense information. I'm shocked to read so many positive reviews on both the CD and book. I have been a landlord for 10 years and own many properties. I wanted to use this CD and book to tap into the lease-options market - I will need to keep researching. I am actually a little upset I purchased the book and CD - it was too expensive for what I got - there just wasn't any substance to take the first steps."
2,Think twice,I purchased this item so I wouldn't have to keep spending money for filter bags. Unfortunately It didn't work out that way. This bag just filters too fine and slows down the suction on my machine. Took it off and haven't used it since. Think twice and make sure before buying it.
4,WYSIWIYG,"Simple, well-made, inexpensive. I use it outside a foam sleeve, for a combination of wet and dry applications. It extends the life of the foam several times over."
1,BEWARE,"This DVD that surfaces frequently on Ebay (and now on Amazon) is a BOOTLEG! Rhapsody has not been officially released on DVD by Warner Home Video as yet. Avoid this bootlegged DVD--look ONLY for the ORIGINAL VHS tape from MGM/UA Home Video (unfortunately out of print and rare, but worth it).BTW--The film itself is super--Can't wait until WARNER BROS. puts it on DVD for real!"
4,The music is worth the price of the DVD or VHS,I found the plot a little slow and the acting by Alda a little too slow for the true George G. All in all the movie was interesting and very sad in places. Lots of stars like Al Jolson and Joan Leslie. If you are a music lover you will enjoy this one.
4,Solid book for Beginning Woodworking,"Covers large range of topics from milling wood to cutting joinery. Contains information on both machine work as well as hand tool wood working techniques, with some projects to tryout your newly learned techniques. Would have liked to see the author go into greater depth in some areas, but overall a solid starting point for anyone interested in woodworking."
4,Some Of The Best,A collection of whimsical lyrics and taboos meant for the open-minded folk. This CD contains some of their best works of art (and I do consider this art) and is well worth the full 2.25 hours...it doesnt get much better than this people!
3,Interesting insight to the pro peloton,"The book is a very quick read. I liked the behind the scenes life of a pro-bike mechanic. What I did not see was the real grit behind the public image. I think the author tried to convey what comprised his work while withholding what we all really want to hear about. ""Who's jerk and why, who's a great guy and why?"" If you want a more raw look at pro cycling consider Paul Kimmage's - Rough Ride."
3,"Great, for the price","... this book is definitely worth it to read about babies from a real guy's perspective. Heck, you can only read about placentas and diaper rash so much before you go woozy and start playing ""Once In a Lifetime"" (""How did I get here?"") by the Talking Heads non-stop. My wife is due in one month and I got some good advice from this book about things best known in advance (work to keep the romance alive). I'll read it again in a few months and I'm sure I'll get some more tips from it."
4,Good tribute.,"The new adult generation pays homage to our parents and grandparents who weathered the Battle of Britain in 1940 in a fresh and exhilarating way without losing the sober, serious spirit of what they went through in beating back the murderous bullies of the Third Reich. Ewan's relationship with his brother is interesting, too."
1,Very poor quality,"Bought the product, plugged it in like instructed, it took 2 days to find the right time, then a week later the projection time on the ceiling lost half the bars and now its hard to tell what time it really is. Dont buy it!"
1,not working after one year,"I bought this clock for my guestroom, as we have a different model in our bedroom and love it. It's difficult to set, even when exactly following the manual, then stopped working altogether after just one year. There are much better products for just a few dollars more."
1,Disappointed,"We gave this clock as a gift and are very disappointed in the way it performs. We thought this clock would continuously project the time on the ceiling as ours does. It turns out you have to push a button to get the projection - defeating the purpose. If you have to find the clock on the nightstand and press a button, why not just go ahead and look at the clock to get the time?"
1,Not Happy,The clock is hard to read from six feet away and the numbers it projects on the celing or wall are too small and not bright enough.
5,Good product,We have enjoyed being able to just open our eyes & look at the ceiling above us & know what time of night it is.
1,Buy something else,"Tiny. Both the clock and the project are tiny, which would be great if I wanted to use it as a travel alarm clock.The instruction manual doesn't offer instructions on how to operate all of the functions of the clock. It does, however, include instructions for setting the time, which seems silly considering its supposed to sync automagically with the Denver atomic clock. The clock has yet to sync, which could be because you aren't supposed to touch any buttons once it has power otherwise it interrupts the sync process. Not touching a button while inserting batteries or the power cable is difficult because of the clock's design.The buttons do not depress well. Rocking the button while pressing sometimes helps it make the connection, but be careful as you might activate one of the settings menus rather than displaying the indoor temperature.Also, it's too light to make a good paper weight."
3,Who wrote the instructions for this clock?,Looks nice but programing/setting the time zone and time was a real pain. They tried to limit the number of buttons on the front and made setting the time zone and time difficult. The projected time should be brighter.
2,Have had better clocks,"Clock worked well for about 5 months and gave up the ghost. The display is very dim and only visible at night in complete darkness. The controls are difficult to maneuver, maybe is easier for a smarter person. If you do not have the book that comes with the clock, you may as well stop while you still have some sanity left.I purchased this to replace a Oregon Scientific which was giving some projection problems...but I threw it away and am now back to using the old Oregon Scientific till my new one arrives in a week or so."
5,Many uses.,"I am not a hobbiest, but have found many uses for the balsa sheets. To divide drawers, boxes, etc. They shipped very quickly, with no broken pieces."
2,Don't like his style,"Ok well I listen to alot of rap and heard different styles, but Mc Frontalot just doesn't work for me. It seems like he pauses a little after every word he says which doesn't make the rap flow. And the music from most of the tracks is ok, would be better if he actually rapped to the beat of the music. I give this album 2 stars for the humor and decent music."
4,Excellent Reference Book,If you are an experienced engineer in the area of pressure containment equipment this boob is full of information that you may not find easily in other sources.
1,1984,"I read this and am reminded of 1984. The tortured arrival at a non offensive language, suggestions for such to writers, is repulsive.This is intellectual vandalism. Works of literature are not vehicles for consciousness raising unless that is the subject.Something about this makes me wonder if the writer has gotten on a narrow path, obsessive in nature, and cannot simply do her job."
1,"Distasteful, self-aggrandizing tripe",Martin's work clearly demonstrates the caliber of his scholarship--slipshod and biased. This book is only of interest to bigots or those pursuing the study of paranoid anti-Semitism in academia. Alas that 'zero stars' is not a rating option.
2,Great Performance Ruined by Bad Production,"It is indeed a very rare occasion when several world renowned violinists get together to perform with the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra at the Huberman Festival. The artistic performance itself is perfect. The recorded audio is horrible. High or low frequencies of the instruments can hardly be heard. The video is below the expected professional standards. Low image quality with focusing too many shots on the orchestra's director rather then the performers themselves. Of and on, for no reason, the video moves to scenes of landscapes and people of Israel, again, with low quality images. I must admit, I have not viewed the whole two DVDs. I gave up after the first one.Buy this DVD only if you respect Vivaldi. This is my humble opinion."
4,Calculator,"It worked great while I had it, my daughter destroyed it within a week of having the calculator."
4,Good scientific calculator with nice features,"This calculator is a good scientific based one with lots of great features for use in just about any engineering discipline. Overall I like the way the keys are laid out and the dual functionality of having both a solar cell and a battery for use when the light is not quite enough. The only complaint that I have is that the entry method is not as intuitive as my old Sharp calculator for things like hex conversion. Other than that, it is a great calculator."
5,This is it! Look no further !!!,"I just got mine 506wbbk and with in minutes I loved it.I decided to get this to replace my 22 years old trusy & great EL-5103 which cost me $50 in 1983 (how much is it in 2005 money? , $100 ?). This new thing is 4 times beter and for the price you can't match. A better manual would be nicer but you'll manage."
3,Not by the comic book author,"The author is Warren C. Ellis, not he Warren Ellis of comic book fame. Amazon should have known better keyed the name as ""Warren C. Ellis"" instead of ""Warren Ellis"" Shame on Amazon. I want all my money back."
2,worse graphics than the NES,"This game is fun to play, but the graphics are terrible. The terrain is green, with some very sparsely placed trees and signs. It is fun to beat down other racers with pipe, chain, hammer, etc... but the bikes are nearly impossible to control at full speed. The expansion pack for the N64 is the biggest waste of money i've ever spent. It does NOTHING to help the graphics or sound quality. multi-player saves it from the graveyard."
2,It's hard to quibble at this price BUT...,"It's hard to quibble with this DVD at this low price but I will anyway. Overall it was disappointing. About half of the performances were lackluster at best and the sound quality on some (remember this is a showpiece for the medium) were underwhelming. I was particularly surprised at the distracting camera work on Billy Joel's number. I love everything Billy Joel but seeing him 'attacked' by multiple cameras was too much. The performances and audio from Stevie Ray Vaughn, Shawn Colvin, Mary Chapin Carpenter, and Tony Bennett were the better numbers. The overall best was Yo-Yo Ma's ""1B"". I have none of his music in my large CD collection but this piece was a visual and sonic standout.If Sony wants to impress with DVD technology, I think they could do a lot better than this. Quibble, quibble."
4,Backstage pass Concert Collection Volume 1,"This DVD is excellent value for the price you pay. The pop and easy listening songs, and the majority of the DVD is this type, are all excellent. The rock songs aren't as good but they are watchable. This DVD is a good lead up to a movie or a family evening. If you like Irish music, Charlotte Church's, ""Danny Boy"" is superior and it alone would make this DVD one that you will play for years to come."
4,"Hey, it's a sampler, okay?","There a wide, make that VERY wide variety of musical styles represented here. It's a great way to sample over a dozen music DVDs to see if they fit what you like to watch. I was surprised how much I liked the touching ""Annie's Song,"" and how subdued Tony Bennett seemed on ""Moonglow."" Anyway, it's a fun starter DVD, and the price is right."
3,"Did not ""Clear the Room"" as Good as it Should Have","I have tried many different brands of fart spray and was very excited when Funantics came out with their SUPER FART SPRAY. I thought to myself, ""Since this fart spray is SUPER, its got to be the best."" Well, let me tell you, just because a product claims to be ""super"" doesn't mean it really is. Super Fart Spray did not clear the room as good as the regular stuff. In fact, people were saying, ""malfouka, why did you switch brands when the other stuff worked better?"" Very disappointing."
3,Planet Drum Goes Visual,"I was so excited when I heard that one of my favorite albums had gotten a visual angle added to it. Mickey Hart (former drummer for the Grateful Dead) brings us Planet Drum. The album itself is incredible, meddling Hart's sound with various tribal rhythms from around the world. The DVD delivers, but I have one major complaint. It only has two songs from the album on it. Come on now, this could have been longer."
3,This Item isn't too bad.,"This is a very good buy if the person playing the game hasn't beaten the main story. If you just buy it to beat the Frontier or fill the pokedex you better not buy it at all. Id just buy it used if at all. Never buy it new if you beat the main story.The main cons are:Frequent miss-spellings/example -(they spelled potions, pations)Pages come off because ofteh poor book bindingsIt only has the Hoenn POkedex info no Fire Red and Leaf Green Monsters."
2,not sharp,The one I got was not sharpened. so IDK if I could recommend this one. I don't know how to sharpen it myself. I am disappointed
2,Does not fit!,"Hole is too small to fit on edger. I finally succeeded in drilling out the hole to fit using a 3/8"" drill but even then had to ream out the hole a little bit more to make it fit. I can tell you this thing is made of some serious metal type as it took quiet a bit of effort to drill out the hole. Had to go at it from both sides and it still took a long time to get the bit through and the bit was new. Seems like the edger maker wants to force you to use their blade. If the hole were the proper size it would be a great blade that lasts much longer and cuts cleaner."
3,a good album but,"not enough good songs. john tries to mix really rootsy songs with love ones on this album. but the mixture does not work well. the roots songs blatantly outweighs the ""pop"" songs. let me give an example. i like the title track and ""I got caught."" the latter is about taking responsibility for one's action,in this case stealing. but songs like beach party and fat she fat spoil the album. this is definitely not an all roots album, although most of the songs are from the roots tradition."
5,Works as claimed,"I used these metric sockets for my weekend car (Lexus, Honda) repair projects:Pros:(1) Very nice blue color & sturdy case;(2) Well built sockets;(3) Low cost, good enough for weekend mechanics;Do you really need sockets that last (claim to last) a lifetime in today's Internet age?"
3,An OK book,"This was not what I was expecting. First, it is written for United Kingdom and I didn't understand some of the terms they used. All of the ""Useful Address"" and websites at the back of the book were in England. I think some of the tests the book talked about are not done in the US. (I could be wrong, that is why I wanted a book on pregnancy!!) Page 18 told you ""The later you have your first child, the greater the reduction in ovary-cancer risk."" Page 22 said ""And the later you have a baby, the greater is your risk of ovary cancer."" I flipped back and forth between these pages for 15 minutes trying to figure this out.It did have some really good points and it did make me feel better about my decision to wait to have childern. It is a good start if you are just beginning to look into pregnancy if your over 30. But, get it at the library........"
3,not her strongest work,"Sheri S. Tepper is a magnificent writter, though I do not feel this was one of her best works. Through reading Beauty, I found some wonderful quotes, but I felt the storyline was weak. I liked how she intertwined fairytales with one another, but I feel that the book could have been stronger if Beauty had not traveled to the future. I understand the feeling Sheri Tepper was trying to create and the message she was trying to send about our society, but it was the way she made everything go into action that made me dislike this particular part of the book."
3,"Good, Not Great","I just finished listening to this CD. And, as with all Dino CDs it put a smile on my face. I did enjoy it but the sound is definitely not as good as ""The Rat Pack: Live at The Sands"" or the live medley segment from the double disc ""The Capitol Years"". The sound quality is somewhat muddled, not like the clear, crystalline sound of the Rat Pack disc. Had I heard this disc initially, I probably would have given it 4 stars, but hearing the Rat Pack CD first, this was almost a let down. The material is virtually the same, so for the extra money, you get much better sound, a more energetic Dean and a livelier show, not to mention Frank and Sammy. This CD is mainly for the real fan (which I am one) and for completists."
3,Big,Its kinda big for my mouth. Im not sure what im suppose to do with it now that i bought it when it won't fit in my mouth. Wish it was smaller. It would have been awesome if you put the ring up to something like a quarter to let people see how big it was before we actually buy it. IM JUST SAYING!
1,ouch,vibrates on your teeth not even comfortable to have in your mouth not worth buying it for the price that it is sold for
1,Study Guide Mistake,"Thought I was ordering the book, not the study guide.The way it was listed it looked like the real book and not a small booklet.Dead subject anyway."
2,Yawn....,"Is is just me or is Deneen one boring individual. I've only read the first 43 pages but I am just so turned off by how this woman went on a trip with a man who didn't want her and always ends up ""pleasing"" herself all the time. She strikes me as a woman who is mad at the world just because she is overweight and can't get a man. I can't get into this book at all. Maybe I'll try to read it again if it's the last thing I have laying around the house."
4,celebrate PAINT,"i thought this book to be somewhat hard for the ""non-painter"" to grasp yet the exercises were lovely. i did this with a friend, a non-painter and she is a very creative soul, however this did not suit her needs and for that i am very sorry.having all of my art being self-taught, i was more able to grasp what Ms. Beam's exercises were alluding to, however, i really wanted to share this with a girlfriend and not a painterly one.great read though, and Ms. Beam's time was definietly well spent on this one."
2,Excellent product; horrible price,The full price of this product is $5 at my local CVS or Walgreens. How can amazon sell any of this product when they are blatantly overcharging SO MUCH? It is a great product. I will continue to schlep to the store to buy it.
5,I Can't Wait For The Movie,"I read one or two books every week and this is the best novel I've read in years. It's not preachy but it does a fantastic job contrasting our time with our parents era and letting us see how things have changed, for the most part for the worse. I totally agree with the reviewer who said that the transformation in Lucky and Jolene's grown children offers hope for our time. In a time that emphasizes shallow celebrity, when we see real heroism like we see in My Father's Eyes, it transforms us if we let it. And in post-9-1-1 America, we need all the transformation we can get. Kudos Mr. Loose!"
5,veteran,"Found My Fathers Eyes, very readable, one that you do not want to put down. Thought it was very unique the way that Loose was able to intergrate the war experience with the family tribulations. Could feel the emotion of Riva Ridge, especially since I lived it in a later war. Good luck to the author and am looking forward to his next work"
1,The Author is [substandard],The author of this book has no understanding of the free market and the constition for which his family suppossedly defends. He attempts to intimidate the legitimate owners of property with specious legal claims.
4,Warriors of the spider,"W Michael Gear is a good writer. I prefer his historical fiction to his interplanetary fiction. Having said that, the Spider trilogy is well crafted, and if this genre is to your taste, read on!"
4,Just fun!,"This compilation contains songs the band recorded before starting their career as one of Germany's best-known rock bands. The songs may sound quite amateurish at first, but give the boys a chance, and you won't regret it. The songs are extraordinarily funny, sometimes more intelligent, mostly pure nonsense, though. Listen and be amused. Most of the tracks sound quite impromptu, but the band's punky past is clearly evident throughout the cd. There are snotty punk-pop rampage songs (""Anneliese Schmidt""), country fakes (""Kopfhaut"") or even surf pop (""Sommer, Palmen, Sonnenschein"") - you'll surely love them. But - of course - you should be able to understand some of the language..."
1,Goofy even for a novelty helmet..,"I wasn't looking for a full on DOT serious helmet (I have 3 of those) but I wanted a spare for the girlfriend to do the bar hop around town and I thought the price was right. What a pile of junk. Super bubble head, uncomfortable interior material, and not even shaped for a normal head! I've had a ton of helmets over the years and they all seem to fit my head pretty well - guess I can assume I have a pretty standard skull - and this one appears to be made for odd shaped craniums or neanderthal man. Just not right. Don't waste your time and money on this piece of junk. I returned it immediately."
3,Barry50,"The CD has NOT arrived yet!!! If it does I will review it then!!I am hoping that this will be very soon as I have waited for quite a few weeks now,"
1,Blah,"Blase', bland, and boring, not much to get excited about. The 50's must not have been as fabulous based on this recording. Mr. Manilow lower your range, you can't those higher notes like you used to."
1,save your mind from this junk and listen to some real rock and some truely great music from the 50's,"1st i would like to say that IM NOT A KID i just dont have an acount now, if you want to know what real rock truely sounds like in all of its raw, hardcore form then listen to the sex pistols album -Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols- or any sex pistols ablum for that matter. and if you want to know what truely great music from the 50's sounded like listen to jerry lee lewis or chuck berry not this watered down junk that makes elavator music sound like hard rock"
1,DREADFUL,"Barry can be enjoyable at times, and some of his old hitssound positively radiant compared to the dreck you hear onthe radio now. That being said, he's never been much of asinger. This CD finds his voice showing signs of strain andlacking that ""certain something"" needed to pull off most ofthese songs. I don't get why so many people will run outto buy this dreck rather than simply listening to the originals.I never thought I'd hear a version of ""Venus"" that made FrankieAvalon sound like a genius by comparison! For the most Die-Hard Barry fans only!"
1,NOT for lovers of Music... it's rather for desperate housewives !,"This is probably a good album for those who've never listened to the music of the 50's before, but if you recognise any of the songs on it, you'll be terribly disappointed by the Las Vegas entertainer's versions.Not only does he seems to be too concerned with his enunciantion , but the arrangements of the songs seem to have been done very hastily and he's not doing the songs any favour.All tracks are also over produced, which lessens the enjoyment even further.This is a top-notch playlist, and these songs are always good to hear - even if doing so makes us long for the real thing."
1,"No No, Barry!","I grew up listening to the songs of the fifties, and loved them. They had wonderful vocalists for those songs, and the operative word here is ""had"". Barry Manilow just doesn't add the spark or emotions these songs need, and he really should get used to the fact he cannot hit those high notes, no matter how hard he tries. That said, there is probably a redeeming factor in this album. If you are an insomniac and need something to bore you to sleep, by all means, get this. It will probably work faster than any sleeping pill. Barry drones on and on here. I gave mine to Goodwill. Shame on me!!!"
1,"Manilow, Fifties and Sixties","Folks - I am a long-standing Manilow fan in an environment where it is not always considered PC to be in that Category. I think his ""Paradise Café"" album is one of the all-time greats. But these two are rubbish.The voice has gone - it even SOUNDS 60+. The selection is great, and so lulls one into the notion that BM plus whatever just has to be good.That used to be the case. I think BM's rendition of ""Come Fly/Dance With Me"" (on the Sinatra abum) is at least as good as the originals as well as being more innovative. But I hafta say that every one of the tracks on these two albums is inferior to the originals. I am not alone in this opinion - everyone to whom I have spoken has expressed disappointment in the discs and is looking to sell them off as rapidly as possible before the news gets around that Manilow has bombed."
4,Pretty good overall :-l,"I'm not normally a fan of this kind of music (as you can tell by my other reviews), but Barry Manilow still has a fantastic voice no matter what you think about his choice of songs. Apparently he whittled down 70 choices of music to get to the final count on this cd. There are some good songs on here; not all are great choices for him, but a lot are beautiful. All I Have To Do Is Dream would be one of the best here, but as I said, I'd get this for his voice alone. He still has it. Now if only he'd quit the plastic surgury to keep the gorgeous looks he used to have when he was younger. He still looked like a guy back then. I imagine this won't be appealing to young kids or anything, but for people who can appreciate great talents and beautiful voices - go get this. It is kind of fun."
1,BARRY NEEDS TO TRY AND GET THE FEELIN' AGAIN,"Those who know me know that I also worship at the Shrine of Manilow. Those who wonder why I won't this time need to listen, even once, even briefly, to this dud. These iconic sounds cannot be duplicated. Manilow's take on them, while heroic, falls far short of the mark.; the originals sounds are simply too ingrained in our ears, the original artists' sounds simply to too strong and vivid to be surpassed, even by someone as talented as Barry. What's scary is how unsteady and unsure Phyllis McGuire seems to be dueting on the medley of ""Sincerely"" and ""Teach Me Tonight."" Moments to remember? We think not."
2,"love ya barry, but....","...not since Julie Andrews starred in the Broadway version of Victor/Victoria has a singer I admire been served so badly. I could only bear to listen to this once after purchase -- his voice is harsh and hoarse and he strains constantly to hit the upper register notes. Glad it's done well for him moneywise, but this is the nadir of Manilow recordings. And is it just me, or are the songs of the 50s -- if this is the representation -- hopelessly gooey? This makes every Manilow penned song look like the hardest alternative rock. Let's hope that the next outing (so to speak) is vastly different."
5,A Very Realistic Show,"I actually already reviewed 16 and Pregnant Season 2 so much of what I said in that review is relevant here. Maci, who gets an apartment with her fiance Ryan, struggles to make a relationship work (dysfunctional) when there's the added stress of a baby; Farrah, a cheerleader, who realizes that her old life is basically dead now that she has a child; and Catelynn, a girl whom I greatly admire. She's the only one, IMO, who realizes that it's about the baby as far as putting the baby first - can she provide for the child, give her anything she needs. Catelynn and Tyler (her boyfriend), make a TOUGH decision to adopt the baby out and while it's so heartbreaking to watch (painful too), you know that the adoptive parents are going to be able to be the parents to this child that Catelynn and her boyfriend eventually want to be. BTW, they're the only somewhat normal couple in the entire series. There are more stories but I'll let the viewer see for herself/himself."
4,Good,The 16 and pregnant DVD was exactly what I ordered and couldn't wait for it to get here now I can't wait to order the rest of them.
1,Show sends the wrong message,"By creating this show, MTV is sending a message to all teens out there that if you get pregnant there is a possibility that you will get to be on MTV. This show does nothing to educate young people on the dangers of unprotected sex nor does it provide them with the tools to stand up to peer pressure. MTV does a disservce to teens everywhere by giving (some) teenagers the idea that if they get pregnant there is a chance that they will get a show on MTV. Unfortunate to say the least."
2,"Lots of words, no creativity","Yes, this program is cheap and you can learn thousands of words, but you might die of boredom first. The pace is extremely fast, meaning that you will have to repeat the same material over and over again in order to remember it. The CD is nothing more than a list of words. I'm going to try to return it to Borders- I hope they take it back so I can get a program that will hold my interest!"
1,A Big Book for Small Minds,"In review of this book I believe it is an adult coloring book for those with a limited vocabulary and who feel the need to look at a lot of pictures to keep them focused.Makes a great bathroom companion for those who want a quick, but often inaccurate read of history written in a sophomoric format on a daily review basis."
1,To the April Review,"It was CO and not cyanide they used. Cyanide was used at first but became too cost prohibitive and they switched to carbon monoxide. Just thought I'd mention it, cuz it's bugging me.."
4,Good material for the EFL classroom,No regrets for buying all the set of these books and their Audio CDs. They have been extremely useful.
2,disappointing!,"I enjoy the pottery barn style and since we are doing minor renovations that give me an excuse to redecorate my bedroom I couldn't wait for this book to arrive. I checked the online reviews of all the PB books and saw some complaints, but I thought overall I'd be glad I made this purchase. Wrong! I flipped through it once right after getting it and I doubt I'll pick it up again. I recall a reviewer of one of the other PB books saying there's nothing in here that you can't get from one of the PB magazines and that reviewer was right. I actually think the bed and bath magazines are better than this book. I'm very glad I purchased just this book and didn't waste money on the entire set. I guess I'll wait for the next PB magazine to come in the mail for any redecorating inspiration."
3,Buy it used,"I am glad I bought this used as I did not feel it was worth full price. The rooms are all the same. Not much inspiration. If you like color (at least more than off white, tan, light blue and cream) than this book is definitely not for you."
2,"Look elsewhere for that ""Pottery Barn"" inspiration.","I love Pottery Barn and have managed over the years to purchase their furniture and a handful of their accessories. They have wonderful ideas (that can be pulled off with a fraction of the price if you look around) that are fun to try and unique. But if you are looking to find that inspiration, don't count on this book. I find that I can get better ideas straight from their catalog instead.....and that is free! Their ideas bordered on boring and not real conducive to everyday use. I plan to stick with the catalog after being disappointed with all of their books in the set."
1,Not worth your money,"Let me start out by saying that I absolutely love Pottery Barn. If I could afford to furnish my house with only products from Pottery Barn, I would. Of course, like most people, I can't afford to do that. I thought this book might provide some ideas on how to make a ""Pottery Barn bedroom"" without the cost of Pottery Barn. Instead, however, it's basically just a lengthy advertisement unworthy of your money.Bottom line: take the 17 bucks you would spend on this book and start a savings account. Add a little to it every month and maybe, someday, you can buy some Pottery Barn furniture!"
3,A good starter look at bioidentical hormones,"Dr. Lee was one of the first to reveal the difference between natural progesterone and progestins. Progestins are one of the synthetic ingredients in Prempro, the HRT drug used in the WHI studies that many women mistakenly think is the only way to replace hormones. Surprise! Hormones that are identical to the ones your body has less and less of as you age have been around for years, like the progesterone cream Dr. Lee recommends. They can't be patented, so drug companies don't push them like they do Premarin and Prempro. I personally also needed natural estrogen, like that in the Vivelle DOT patch and Estrace tablets, so you might want to do some reading beyond Dr. Lee. It's not ""all in your head"" and it affects your mind, body, and sex life, so get your hormones straight!"
4,Good but one sided.,"Good story from the rarely seen Native American perspective. It tells an interesting history of the Garrison Dam and the loss of good Tribal land and the physical splitting in two of a reservation and the effects that had on the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nations. It doesn't however look at any effects that had on the white farmers and ranchers in the area."
2,Carhartt didn't last a month,The knees tore out quickly--the buckles are hard to undo. I would go with another brand for more sturdy material. These were very thin and soft!
4,good product and priced fairly,"Will do business with them again ! Would have liked to know a little more about how the bags where packaged inside the box, because my rak-n-sak rack has a place from dipensing bags in the cover !"
5,Prepare to wait!,I waited 3+ weeks for this item to arrive. Plan ahead if you need these trash bags.
3,Rack Sack bags,"The product was delivered faster than I expected. On inspection it was evedent that it was not an exact replacement in that each bag was seperate , whereas the origional bags came in a roll that stower at the bottom of the Rack Sack frame. They are, however, serviceable but take longer to install a replacement."
1,Very disappointed,Order never arrived. I called after 2 weeks and was told it would be another 2 weeks. very poor service.
2,Frequent Signal Problems,The results have been very disappointing with this unit: it loses the sensor signal on a regular basis (as frequently as once a week). Careful installation (signal check and leveling) did not prevent the problem. Not recommended.
1,weak,"this item constantly needs resetting. signal loss is rampant even if there is clear line of sight between base unit and the two remote sensors. the outdoor temp sensor rarely goes for 5 days before the readout goes to dashes even though the signal indicator reads a connection. the ""fix"" i got from the manufacturer involves bringing all the units to within 10' of each other, removing the battery box covers, and sequentially pressing all the reset buttons. well, that works for awhile but it erases all the data so the history function showing the accumulated rainfall over time is useless. dissapointed and aggrieviated."
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased Oregon Scientific ""long range"" rain gauge in October. The product description states a 300-ft transmitting range. I placed my rain gauge in the backyard with the receiver in the house no more than 30-feet away (and by a window, too!). In less than an hour the receiver no longer was getting the signal. This was after using brand new Energizer Max batteries, instead of the cheap ones provided. I tried re-booting the transmitter and receiver with them sitting next to each other (a minor annoyance having to remove the EIGHT screws to get to the batteries). The connection was quickly restored, so I returned the rain gauge back to its place outside. The receiver continued to maintain contact for about 35 minutes, but then lost it again. I am extremely unhappy with my purchase."
3,Disappointed,"The Rain Guage - accuracy and range are ok. The indoor out/door temperature readings are real accurate. Accuracy is ok at 65 degrees, but at 90 the error is +2.5 degrees.The numeric displaly should be a bit larger so the information would not look cluttered, detail is very hard to see from across the room.Update: 4/2009As others have reported, after about 1 year the rain guage stopped communicating with the base unit.I would not purchase this unit again."
1,Very Unhappy,"First, installing the batteries is a joke, as others have mentioned. Why is this not a snap-door installation? 12 screws to put batteries in the rain bucket? Come on...After I got past that, the indoor and outdoor thermometers were 8-10F different after sitting on my kitchen table all day. I put the outdoor probe outside and it was consistently 8-10F different from my other unit, and the local NWS readings. I called the manufacturer, and they could have cared less.Amazon was great though. They refunded my money including shipping with no complaints. Recommend Amazon, do not recommend Oregon Scientific..."
2,Will Not Display 7 to 9 Day Cumulative Rainfall,Bought this item to set display so that it would always show the last 7 to 9 days of rainfall. Sorry about that! The only way to get the last 7 days is to either remember to re-set the cumulative display every 7 days OR to select each previous of the last 7 days and then manually ADD UP the rainfall for 7 days...UNACCEPTABLE!Also there are TOO MANY little screws that have to be removed in order to change batteries....about 9-10 if I remember correctly.Sent this unit back and bought Honeywell TC-152. It is cheaper and can be set to always display last seven days of rainfall. Down side...it has a lot of screws to remove also.
4,Oregon Scientific RGR126 Cable Free Long Range Rain Gauge,"A really fascinating and useful device. It permits you to receive up-to-date rainfall, indoor and outdoor temperatures over a distance of 100-300 ft. It seems to be a really excellent product.If I could suggest one improvement in design and presentation, I would ask that Oregon Scientific revisit their instruction manual regarding the depiction and instructions on installation of the batteries--significantly deficient. I would also suggest that they redesign the battery location and protection against moisture since it currently requires the removal and replacement of a myriad of small screws."
1,failed after 7 months use.,"This unit is attractive and attractively priced, however my 2nd one just expired at the 7 month point. The 1st one only managed 6 months. The unit worked fine up until, although I'm a little suspicious of the rainfall amount accuracy, and certainly wasn't abused in the least. First the rainfall part stopped working and dis-assembly, cleaning, and battery replacement were to no avail. two weeks later the outdoor temp unit stopped working. I guess in this price range my expectations were a little high. This is the second Oregon Scientific product I've bought and will be my last."
5,Handy Tester,"With so many products using so many diffferent types of batteries today, this handy little tool is so convenient for checking all my battery needs. It is small, compact and easy to use."
2,Not what I thought,"This book is not ""just like volume #1"" Volume #1 has classical skits such as ""Who's on first?"". Volume #1 also has some stuff that we will not be preforming--ever.Volume #2 is a compilation of Christian based skits that teach a lesson. If you are looking for skits for a church youth group, this is a fine book. However, I found the skits contrived and very good at stating the obvious. I read a few of them to my kids and at the end we all looked at each other like, ""Duhhh!"" (I must admit I did not read all the skits, and therefore there may be a few that are truly clever.)The Greatest Skits on Earth (Volume 2)It might be better to just come out and talk to the youth instead of trying to feed them chocolate coated brocholli. Call the brocholli brocholi and tell them it is good for them.This book was not what I expected. Before you buy it, make sure it is what you want, maybe check it out from a library."
2,For VB Developers ONLY!,"Do not get this book if you program in anything other than VB (not even vbscript). The name of the book should have been ADO for Visual Basic...except that title was already taken. What really gets on my nerves is that the sample chapter released on O'Reilly's web site is the chapter where they give code examples for all of the different languages. The rest of the book is nothing like that chapter!If you are a VB programmer though, I'm sure you will love this book."
5,Great Book,A good book for all golfers. Tom's relationship with Harvey Penick is obvious and he learned a lot from Harvey and it shows in his golf game. It's a great book.
4,It is a useful source of info for tort lovers.,"Easy to read and lots of practical information based on author's vast experiences. As a beginner, I truly found it resourceful and useful. If you love to read a how-to book, it is the one you're looking for. But if you love fancy photos, 4-color pictures for reference purpose, etc. it's not what you need. Liz, it'd be very much better and will be perfect if you could possibly include more 4-color pictures of famous tortoises and turtles."
3,It's like instant steel-cut oatmeal,"Scottish oats are fine, I just like rolled and steel cut oats better. These taste the same as steel cut, but have a gummier, less crunchy texture. They're like the instant oats of the steel cut world.Quality is tip top, I'd buy from Bob's Red Mill again."
3,*** WARNING: May Contain Tree Nuts ***,"I love Bob's Red Mill products, but we have a boy who is seriously allergic to cashews. This product is manufactured on equipment that also processes tree nuts (including cashews--I called the company.) That's not readily apparent on the package, however, and it is too darned bad that this great company has yet to wake up to the continuing rise in the numbers of kids with food allergies. I hope that they someday take the organic and natural wagon one step further. Great product, but not for those with nut allergies."
5,So glad I tried them,"I first heard of scottish oats a couple of years ago and thought ""how different could they be? Oats are oats."" Well, one night after reading all the reviews, I decided to give them a try. Only under great duress will I eat ""regular"" oats again-cracked, steel cut, rolled-any of them. Scottish oats are like oat groats that have been cut into smaller, fluffy pieces.I have gotten into the habit of soaking my grains overnight before cooking. No they don't get mushy. They are supposed to be healthier after soaking. All I know for sure is that I don't get hungry as quickly and they cook up quick. Same with the oats. I soak them over night, add a little more water if needed in the morning, turn on the heat and start adding spices (my current favorites are cardamom, cinnamon and a touch of cloves). I have to remember to stir the pan as the oats cook up quick this way. Sometimes I add protein powder (whey) to make it a complete meal."
1,"Wretched, confusing, overwritten and under-designed hash","Instructors: Don't let your students have this book! It is very different from the usual Course Technology books. - Immensely complicated continuing example presented without understanding - Dense prose - Topics presented far in advance of their use - No explanation of the big picture--what is important, and why - Mythical supervisors continually telling us what to do, but giving little orientation."
3,Blind Boys,I love the Blind Boys but I didn't think this was one of their best works.Buy it only if you know and like these songs.
2,Stick with JM 1&2,"Go back NOW! JM3 is a marketing ploy. The first two Motos are great; the physics of the bikes are realistic. The third one, however, goes off of the deep end. Control of the bikes is jerky and the graphics aren't fluid. I bought JM3 because I had so much fun with the other two...... big mistake! This one should have been the first... a lot of kinks still needing to be worked out. The worst game in my collection."
5,"Mysteries with a capital ""M""","If you prefer your mysteries to take place on the foggy streets of London, teeming with clueless Bobbies, international spies, Cockney street thugs, master criminals, and the occasional suffragette riot, look no further and focus your magnifying glass on this collection of excellent crime stories."
5,The Rocket Review Rocks!,"Not only does the Rocket Review make SAT preparation fun and easy, it also helped me get my score up by 230 points!"
3,A Book of Quotes,"This is not a book of Strips. It is really a book of quotes sorted by subject matter... this could almost be made into Hallmark cardsFor example the subject is Effort and the quote is Some of my best school papers have been written before breakfast.......Sally Brownand on the opposing page is her examining her written workThe book is 128 pagesProbably one thing I was able to enjoy a little more in this book is Charles Schulz's artwork Like a close-up of Charlie Brown looking into an empty mailboxAnd Charlie Brown laying flat on his back with circles around his headJust little things like that.....I did enjoy this book I gave it three stars cause I was disappointed it wasn't a book of strips, I like the new way they have of sorting the strips for us Baseball, other sports, School and of course Love and I thought this was another one.....Maybe it didn't get four stars cause it was done too soon One quote a page You feel like a speed reader."
4,very informative and readable,"Large chunks of the book seem to have been lifted verbatim from the author's ""A History of God"" (or the other way around). Left me feeling a bit cheated, but I guess it's legal. Otherwise a very readable book, the prophet comes across as a very sympathetic and inspiring man. ( One gets the distinct impression that Ms. Armstrong wishes she had been one of his wives. :>) However the author's denunciation of Western attitudes does not seem objective. I think she may be guilty of the same kind of stereotyping that she accuses (other) Western writers of."
2,VIVA! LATIN RHYTHM WORKOUT DVD,"This is not what I expected. Elise is high energy buy nothing is put together and it gets confused. You will be better off buying the Crunch Cardio w/Gizelle and or Cal Pozo's Salsa Sizzle. These really get you sweating and you burn calories, lose weight and get that slim waistline. I am 56 and I feel great doing these videos and my body looks like that of a much younger person. Elise's video is just so so and it is more expensive than the other ones I purchased. Not a good one to start the day with. I am sorry I wasted my money.Viva! Latin Rhythm Workout DVD"
5,For all who want to Buy it,I'm a big fan of Buffy. When I saw this gift when I unwrapped itI felt like WOW. If you are a big fan of Buffy buy and it well be the best game you have played. I think the person should be older then 12 to play it. If you buy it for that buffy fan make sure you buy it from ....
5,what else could we ask for?,"this is the best game anyone could ever play its fun and it teaches strategy if you watch buffy the vampire slayer like i do you will love this it has most of buffys foes the master, adam e.t.c and even if you dont watch the show it will help you learn more about and have alot of fun at the same time."
4,Dense And Masterful,"I'd intended to kick in my two cents on PATH OF DREAMS some time ago, but, after many months & many plays, I STILL find new things in it. This is one of those recordings you need to live with for a few years before you're ever fully conversant with it. Suffice it to say that there's a whole lot going on here, and perhaps the only fly in the ointment are the sorta-operatic vox of frontman Seravalle....which aren't horrendous but do take some time to grow on you. Musically, however, the album's unimpeachable. I understand that the record company (WMMS) has since gone under, rendering Garden Wall's back catalogue difficult to obtain, at best. (I've been seeking ""Seduction of Madness"", the followup, for a while now - without success.) Still worth the sweat to track down."
1,WASA Crisp'n Light inside packaging cannot be recycled.,"WASA Crisp'n Light inside packaging cannot be recycled. The crackerbread is excellent, but its inside packaging is a cellophane or type of plastic that cannot be recycled anywhere in the six states I have contacted. Todate WASA has not revealed what the inside packaging is made of, nor where I can recycle it."
5,Wonderful low-carb light and crispy cracker,"The title just about says it all. These crackers (crispbread, if you will) are light and airy and come in around 4 grams of carb each. I cut them into 8 pieces with a sharp knife and use them for dips, as well as ""conveyers"" for cheese and other goodies. They have become my favourite snack. Yes, they are bland, but I like the fact they pick up the flavour of what they are served with and don't overpower."
2,NOT AS GOOD,"i got it and had it for 4 weeks. i thougth the smell of kerosene would go awaay after burning it a few times, but i still have the smell ok the kerosene in the house bad and it burns your eyes from the smell of the kerosene."
2,Need help,"I purchased this heater and recieved it a few days ago. It was just the size I wanted and needed. We put it together and let it sit filled as instructed, There was a horrible kerosene burning ordor. I contacted the company, they told me to compleatly burn it out and fill it this will take care of the ordor. It didn't. I contacted them again and told me to buy a kerosene additive . I did this and the ordor was worse. Can anyone help me with this product?"
3,returned it,Probably a nice unit but....Had to return when I found out they are illegal in my state. would have been nice if they could tell you that before you buy it.cant buy kerosine for it that easily either.. cost over 24 dollars to return item.. merry christmas
4,Gamo Magnum .177 Spire Points,"Gamo Magnums seem to be the ammo with the largest .177 exit hole of all, according to online reviews! I bought 'em a couple weeks ago and began re-adjusting my rifle scope for the new pellets.My rifle is a Crosman G1 Xtreme rated @ 1000 fps.I'm happy with the target shooting results at 25 feet but the hits are still erratic at 25 yards. This may mean further scope adjusting is needed, or that the Magnums are best suited for close range firing."
2,Wobbly,"I ordered two pairs of these stools. They are pretty looking, but feel very wobbly. Since I'm buying them to be used by drunks at my house and not for looks I'm sending them back. PLUS the seat cushions are completely wrapped in plastic, so I'd have to unscrew the cushions to get the plastic wrapping off! Crazy cheap construction."
2,cheap stools,"Stools are sub-par in quality. One had a chip out of the foot, and the one we use most(2-3 times a week) has become rickety after only a few weeks. I guess one can't expect much for $50 each, but had hoped they would last longer than this. Not a good buy for the $$."
5,Fast and Courteous,"These stools arrived on time but one was broken. I contacted The Storage Store and immediately recieved a reply with a promise to send out a replacement. They were very courteous and fast with their solution to my problem. The replacement came today and in perfect condition. The barstools are just beautiful, it is as one reviewer said, it is just the packaging that is causing the chipping and/or breaking. I would buy from them again, anytime."
3,Beautiful look but not so sturdy,"These barstools are beautiful. They are very attractive--however, not so sturdy. After a week the bottom of one of the legs was chipped badly. I am not sure that they are going to hold up to my three teenagers. The price was very reasonable so we will probably order two extras for replacements."
4,Overall great stools,"I bought one set of these stools about 6 months ago, and another set recently. They come fully assembled, which is really fantastic. I HATE assembling furniture, and it's so nice that you just have to take these stools out of the box and you're done. They are packaged really well and come in good condition. They look very nice/not cheap, but they are a reasonable price ($99 for a pair). The one thing that I don't like about these stools is that the wood tends to chip at the very bottom of the stool legs. That's kind of a drag, but a little wood glue fixes that. All in all, very satisfied with this purchase."
5,TOP NOTCH,"Perfect condition, what else to say about a brand new book?About the content, great way to learn more, on your own, about hispanic culture and civilization"
2,Honestly quite boring,"I also had a problem with the author who uses anti western undertones throughout the book. I understand there is a lot of conquest throughout history, especially when Europe meets America, but it seemed like everything was being portrayed in the worst light for Europe while elevating the Americas. I was looking for an unbiased history, not a sob story, and this does not cut it. If it was a little more entertaining I could have looked past the authors obvious bias, but because I was so bored I started critiquing it severely while reading and was not satisfied."
5,Very insightful and readable,"The amazing thing about this book was that it was so in-depth and complete, that it might be considered a clinical analysis, but she manages to make it very readable and engaging anyway. I have read many other books on recovery (Bradshaw, Beattie, Melody, Gorski) but this one really has a way of getting down to brass tacks like none of the others. Reframing is one of the words you will see used quite frequently here, and it is the concept of going back to previous experiences and reliving them to change the way your brain records the associated emotions. While she never mentions it, this is one of the foundations of NLP work, which I strongly believe in.My one complaint is the cover! It is pretty ugly. Why? An ugly cover creates a negative impression and will lower the odds of somone wanting to come back and continue reading the book. I hope they do a second edition and change that."
4,"Interesting Idea, but it really would scare little kids.","I have a Japanese copy of this move, so I can't say much about what's said, but Giovanni is seeking to reclaim Mewtwo for some reason. I don't want to spoil the movie for people, but this movie could really scare kids 7+under due to some scenes where it appears Mewtwo is being tortured by Giovanni, nothing graphic, but it probably would upset some kids. It was an interesting movie that really shows off Team Rockets Gadjets to the fullest. It also introduces a rocket named Domino, who, for those who have seen Sakura Wars, is very much like Sumire, some Professor guy, some green-haired girl with glasses, and a few others. Any Pokemaniac, Giovanni fan, and/or Mewtwo fan will appreciate this movie. there may be an ad for Pokemon 4 on this tape, which was something seemingly missing from Pokemon 3."
5,Espanol! Mewtwo!,"This movie is for all you spanish people. The ultimate pokemon Mewtwo has returned! It's sort of like a sequel of Pokemon the First Movie. Ash, Brock and Misty must protect the world from Mewtwo! Is Ash and Friends up to this challenge?!"
3,Good Disco Music,"I like to dance, so when it comes to music, I am picky! I first heard the song ""I want your soul"" on a satellite radio station. I wrote it down, went home and ordered this CD. It's a good song, but the rest of the CD gets kind of old pretty quick. It's like the same beat and rhythms in each song... I would have bought the single if they had it; but other than that, the CD is not bad. If you happen to like the song that I described, I would search for it's single, instead of the actual CD, unless you like mindless repetition. Lol"
2,Gross,This book came sticky and gross. I tried my best to wash off the sticky but it didn'r really wash off. It was so gross.
4,Memorable tale of obsessive passion,"Very atmospheric and memorable work by a truly talented writer. Don't be misled by the description on the cover - it greatly misrepresents the story, as is typical of these types of books. I'm referring to the 1950s version - the more current reprint probably describes the book more accurately. In any case, Fischer tells a compelling story of a pro basketball player who gets mixed up with a true femme fatale during an off-season ""rest"" in a small town. It's good that the title character is definitely flawed both morally and in his judgment. The only false note is the offer of a possible conventional happy ending on the last page - but that seems so inconsistent with the dark tone of the rest of the book, that I'm just choosing to ignore it. The leading character isn't a bad guy, but he hasn't earned his happiness quite yet."
1,Why Did Grizzly Bother Manufacturing this Tool?,"I have NEVER had more difficulty with any power tool in my 50 plus years of buying and using tools. I have had more problems getting this power tool up and running than anything I have ever bought. The manual of instructions for assembly is woefully incomplete. I suspect that a novice would never have been able to get the machine running. While I now have it running, it still requires more adjustment and modification. All I can say is the person who designed it either is not a woodworker or this is the first time they ever designed a power tool. Clearly that person never tried to use it after it was on the market. In conclusion I can only say I would not recommend this sander to anyone and plan to send more detailed comments with pictures to Grizzly. Allan Furman, Deerfield Beach, FL"

3,"Cool Masks, Not a Craft for Kids","I bought this for our daughter, thinking she would have fun making these masks as a ""free time"" activity. The masks are really cool looking. Unfortunately, they are WAY too hard for children to cut out and assemble. Frankly, they are almost too hard for me to put together. I wouldn't recommend this as a craft for homeschoolers. It's more like a classroom decoration."
1,This book sucks!,"Basically cheesy written porn, sleazy, bad story lines. Purchased this book because another short story by the same publisher was a nice read. Do not recommend this book."
5,thrilled with the quality,Excellent piece of cookware. My family were big fan of Corningware and this set was indeed comparable though little heavier but for price qualty is extremely good. Gave as a Christmas gifts to people and they loved it.
1,Corelle is not supposed to break....,"I bought two sets over a year ago. I had a slice of pizza on a plate and put saran wrap on it. When I whent to put it in the refrigerator, the plate fell and broke into hundreds of pieces. I thought it was not supposed to chip let alone break like that..."
3,"Good dishes, a bit delicate","This dish set is good, but the plates are a bit thin. I worry a bit about breaking them as a result. However, it's been two months and none have broken in the dishwasher yet. We'll see...Update: It's now about 3 months in. On the bright side, the dishes haven't broken. On the dark side, near the top of one bowl has developed a small row of weird indentations. If I had to guess, this is the result of heat damage from microwaving some pasta. While our microwave has decent power, we don't exactly nuke things to death so I'd say that's a product flaw. The bowls shouldn't be deforming under normal use."
2,Scratch within 5 mos,"I love this set, but its life is just too short.After 4 mos of carefully use and hand wash, the bowls and plates scratched. I could see the silver beneath the enamel coating. Very disappointed.Also, amazon is nice enough to issue the warrantee, which is a refund.Very skeptical about corelle quality from now on."
5,Best Price Out There...,"I purchased two sets (to make up a service for eight) as a gift. Corelle is always a nice buy, especially when you have children because of it's durability. It arrived promptly, with no breakage whatsoever."
2,30th Anniversary Edition? Really??,"How can you call this a 30th Anniversary Edition? Even the re-mastered version of Exodus has 2 bonus tracks for crying out loud. The Deluxe Edition released in 2001 is the way to go. It contains 'Roots', one of Marley's non-album classics, 2 versions of 'Punky Reggae Party', alternative takes, tracks recorded with Lee Perry and a bunch of live tracks from the Exodus tour. Five Star rating. Why would you go any other way?If you're looking for a 30th Anniversary Edition, pick Culture's Two Seven's Clash. Beautifully remastered with great bonus tracks. This is nothing more than marketing nonsense."
1,Shameful,"Do not waste your money. These sheets are rough, scratchy and see through. My son had a Nemo themed room so we purchased these sheets. what a waste of money. It is very sad that something so loveable and pricey is made so poorly. I would recommend getting the Nemo comforter which is well made and buying a set of comfy sheets."
4,Delving into the depths of 1 John,"This book stands alone among commentaries of 1 John - non that I've read matches its combination of depth, warmth, clarity, conviction, and worship. Only problem with this version is that it is a photocopy in a new cover, so the words can be hard to read at times from the rasterization effect."
4,"Beautiful picture, Good clues","I bought this floor puzzle for my 3 1/2 year old grand daughter whose few simple puzzles had gotten too easy. After a little bit of teaching as to what ""corner"" and ""straight edge"" mean, she has been able to do it herself. The puzzle provides good clues by the pictures. I could ask, ""Where's some more zebra?"" the first few times, and now she knows some strategies. Plus, the picture is high quality and shows quite a number of African animals. It would be nice if the puzzle were made of a little bit heavier stock, but this is certainly adequate for a family use puzzle."
1,This is Asperger Syndrome,"My husband and I were both REALLY disappointed in this book. As it states in the book, kids with AS are often very smart. That is one of the reasons that we bought this book so our 9 year old with AS could read it and maybe understand why he is how he is. He wanted to know why we would give him a book that even a preschooler could understand. There was really not much help in this book. He thought that it was a VERY expensive coloring book. I really would NOT waste my money on this book if you want to find out what AS is all about. It shows NOTHING but NEGATIVE simple examples"
5,wwf wrestle mania 2000,I love the game!It's hard so it keeps you trying to beat it.There's always something to do.The create a wrestler is great!I gave it 5 stars.It's my favorite game!(and i like a lot of games)

WRESTLEMANIA 2000 HAS QUICK FAST GAMEPLAY AND THE ENTRANCES SET THE STANDARD FOR FUTURE WRESTLING GAMES.I SUGGEST THIS GAME TO ANY TRUE FAN OF WRESTLING OR JUST A ACTION GAME LOVER!"
4,Excellent WWII Spy Thriller,"What may seem a common theme the WWII spy protecting the secret of the D-day invasion gets a good treatment by Larry Collins in ""Fall From Grace"". The book has all the elements to make this a page turner, plus the author delves into some of the background information that gives a good perspective on the why in military terms. Highly recommend!!!"
4,An Interesting and (Largely) Undiscovered Gem,"Captain Tractor's ""Bought the Farm"" mixes elements of Celtic (the large part) and ska (a very small part) and fashions music that mainly features the bar as the setting.The songs are inventive and fun, retrospective and wistful and, even at times, bitter. Much like the variations in alcohol (if you will).The highlights of this album include ""1,000 Goodbyes,"" ""Someday,"" ""Dublin Lullabye,"" (featuring the lyric, ""We drink and fight/drink and fight/ and drink fight some more""), ""Frozen Puck to the Head,"" (with the protagonist being a hockey goalie who is in love), the bitter ""40 Miles of Pain"" and the ever playful cover of ""If I Were a Rich Man"" (from the musical ""Fiddler on the Roof"")."
2,"Yeah, but ...","I got a Nicer Dicer a couple of months ago and for a little while I was having a great time with it. Carrots, tomatoes (if I was willing to clean up the mess afterwards), apples, turnips, onions ... nice and neat little chunks in a very short time, happy joy. But then I found the Nicer Dicer's kryptonite--rutabagas. One piece KILLED the large grid, bending several of the blades irreparably. A couple of other people I know (freaks who also like rutabagas) confirmed that they couldn't cut them with the Nicer Dicer either. If you stay away from rutabagas you should be okay, but as I mentioned tomatoes (even the hard ones) will make a mess and items like potatoes and carrots will pose some difficulty if you don't set them just so. Williams-Sonoma sells a very similar product for about five dollars less than the Nicer Dicer that's a lot sturdier and offers more options, including a measuring cup. This was a birthday gift; if you want one try to get someone else to spend the money."
5,She asked for it and She deserved it!,"I first captured her heart 15 years ago when I gave her the first gift of Joy.I think I am probably good for another 15 years.Not only is Joy a fantastic one of a kind perfume, I also find it to be non-allergenic in that because of the natural ingredients, it does not aggravate my asthma.Great double benefit! She loves me and I like Joy.The delivery was right on time too and the price was RIGHT!Thanks"
2,Scant resource guide,"I bought this book because it has the exact look I want for my bathrooms--traditional bridge faucets, vintage type toilets, white tiles. I got few ideas for my dressing room layouts. But where s the resource guide for all those wonderful faucets? I don't think Pottery Barn sells those? I agree you'd get the same info and design inspiration from their catalogs. Not very practical."
2,You get what you pay for,"The item itself is made from man-made materials, very cheaply made in Pakistan. Quality of workmanship is poor, of materials is OK. It does not close easily. I have mounted it on my windshield and it's slight curve distorts the rectagular bag so that lowering the flap is difficult with one hand, it takes the second to lift the body of the bag to make the flap to easily go over the ""close button"". The ""close button"" does come undone during brief rides (under 30 minutes) on LA freeways. I recommend it if you are looking for something cheap. The bolt that comes with the bag is about 3 inches in length, I had to saw off 1.5 inches to make it look OK."
5,Studded windshield bag,"Love this windshield bag! Fits great on my Yamaha, looks good too. Holds items I need to keep close at hand while riding. Able to get a 16 ounce bottle if water in bag as well."
3,Going Down!!!,I was Not very pleased with The Album when Compared to the Band's Performance in Australia.The Lighting was not Pleasing.
2,Worst. Transformer. Ever. Optimus doesn't deserve this!,"Do NOT and I mean DO NOT, pay the high markup price from the sellers on Amazon. I bought this toy at my local Walmart for $20 and it isn't even worth that much let along, $70+. I'll give it some credit, it looks pretty good in robot mode and he is pretty posable, but it's when or if you can get back into truck mode, I don't know maybe I got a defective one, but when you have to transform him into truck mode, it's like pulling teeth. I simply could not get his hood and the second half of his body to line up correctly, leading me to throw it against the wall. I'm normally very patient with my transformers but this one just blew my mind. What really gets me is how simple his transformation really is, but yet I couldn't get mine to work. So do yourself a favor and seek out a different version of the Autobot leader!"
3,No me ames,It's not that good but it has one absolut fantastic song on it. That's NO ME AMES. When I first heard this song I was amazed. OK I was amazed about Marc Anthony because he gives the song that fantastic flair but Jennifers voice sounds good to his.The rest of the songs are not the best and not the worst. She is a good actress but she isn't a great singer.
3,BRUSHING UP.,"'ON THE 6' IS CONSIDERED ONE GREAT SONY PRODUCTION.HOWEVER JENNIFER NEED TO BRUSH UP HER VOCAL.IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.THE FAST SONGS ARE STILL NOT BAD,BUT FOR THE BALLARDS,FOR GOODNESS SAKE,PLEASE DO SOMETHING BOUT'IT! NUMERICALLY,'ON THE 6' WAS QUITE WELL RECEIVED.IT HAD SOLD A REMARKABLE 2.5 MILLION COPIES IN THE STATES.THE DEBUT SINGLE 'IF YOU HAD MY LOVE' HIT THE TOP SPOT OF BILLBOARD HOT 100 SINGLES CHART,SELLING AN ASTOUDING 1.5 MILLION COPIES,REMAINING AT THE TOP FOR 5 WEEKS.SECOND SINGLE 'WAITING FOR TONIGHT' WAS ALSO A US TOP 8 SINGLE. OTHER SONGS IN THIS ALBUM THAT MADE A GREAT HIT ARE 'NO ME AMES',A DUET WITH MARC ANTHONY.THE SONG IS IN LATIN/SPANISH.IT SOUNDS REALLY GREAT.YOU CAN ALSO TRY 'PROMISE ME YOU TRY'.APART FROM THE 4 RECOMMENDATION,I GUESS THAT ALL."
5,tha CD is the bomb,"j-lo her first CD, she did pertty good 4 a new artist, and her first CD i love and is really kool and i have no bad reviews on it!"
5,Back when Jennifer was good and only known as Jennifer!,"So I can't hide that I like pop music, it's fun and it's easy to listen to. This album didn't disappoint me, granted it's mostly filler and the singles are the best songs, but it's such a fun album, back in the time when Jennifer was only known as Jennifer and was acually pop! This album had her best song Waiting For Tonight and Jennifer actually seemed to be having fun, now it just seems to be all about collecting husbands and increasing her riches, it's sad really. But this album is a must!"
1,Not so good,"I love the song ""Waiting for Tonight"" but that's as far as it goes.My advice is stick with the acting jennifer."
2,On the 6? What the crap does that mean??!,"In her she movies, Lopez likes to play maids and waitresses but refrains from singing. If only she could act that way in real life then we'd finally solve world hunger."
5,FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!THE BEST ALBUM OF THE YEAR!!!!,"I LOVED IT.It is a fantastic album with various styles from pop to R&B and from latin to dance.Well done Jennifer.You are FANTASTIC.Don't miss it for nothing.It's an excellent choise and is far far better than Ricky's Martin album whose only nice song is his duet with Madonna which is a wonderful song.Anyway On the 6 is an excellent album, maybe the best of this year and especially ""If You Had My Love"" and ""Let's Get Loud"" are superior songs.WELL DONE JENNIFER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
1,terrible attempt to make an album,"I advise anyone who likes music not to buy the album, the only good song is ""If you had my love"" than they just kept getting worse, ""waiting for tonight"" was so bad the words were ridiculous and its mostly sung by back up singers, and than her duet with marc anthony is really bad if i could i would return the album. don't buy it, trust me."
2,She aint better than Selena,After reading everyones review I have to agree with most of them she can act and dance but singing she is just ok in. Yeah shes pretty but she aint nuthin like the real selena. Selena can actually sing and dance.Her life was just short but her legend still lives on. I dont mean to disrespct anyone here but this is only my opinion
2,"She's Got a Great Butt, But a Sub-Par Voice","I love Jennifer Lopez. She is one of the most beatiful women in the world. She is a talented actress (great in Selena and Out of Sight). But singing is not her thing. I agree with other folks that she just does not have a strong singing voice and that she has gotten a lot of help from the mixing process that keeps her from sounding totally terrible. Jennifer is smart, she's popular and wants to explore all her possibilities while she has that fame. Eddie Murphy did it (he sucked), David Soul did it (he sucked) and I think Jennifer is doing it (and she pretty much sucks). Jennifer should stick to acting!I'll probably toss the CD and keep the pictures of her from the CD booklet, she's gorgeous!"
1,A library assistant's review,"If the point here is music, I am afraid Jenny , you missed it. Incongruity between vocals and background beats ; and the attempt to mix R&B, lateino and dance pop makes the Jennifer Lopez CD a big fiasco.In fact according to my esimation, this is the worst CD I've ever recommended for the university's library."
3,Only a few good songs,"I like ""If you had my love"" and listened to a little of this disc at Borders -- it seemed pretty good. But when I got it home and listened to the songs all the way through, a lot of them were really repetitious and boring. I think she's a good singer but I only liked about 2 other songs besides ""If"". Too bad! I can't stand the hokey ""talk-singing"" routine (pseudo-sexy murmuring in Spanish) that she does near the end of one otherwise good song."
5,I've heard some of the songs....,..on radio 1's Rythm nation and it sounds pretty cool. Definte R n' B talent!. Too Late is a mellow R n' B track. Feelin' so good is very cool and more upbeat R n' B. I love waiting for tonight as well. I'm going to go out and get this C.D coz it seems fantastic!
4,Great first album,"I think that this is a great effort as a debut album coming from Jennifer. The songs are really cool and catchy, and it's really easy to get into them. I really love Let's Get Loud because it's so energetic and is a great track for a party. No Me Ames is another great track. The tropical remix version is better than the ballad version. The collaboration with Marc Anthony is amazing, and the two sound really good together. Feelin' So Good with Big Pun and Fat Joe is also another great party track and the collaboration is also cool. The first single, If You Had My Love is always a cool song, as well as Waiting For Tonight because when you hear them, it's really hard not to get into them. I would definitely recommend buying this because it has really cool music. It's a great addition to any CD collection, whether or not you like Jennifer."
3,It's nothing spectacular; Jennifer can get away with it.,"Jennifer Lopez is a better actress than vocalist. She can carry a tune, however her voice reflects limited talent. If she's given a second chance, maybe she can improve by the second album."
1,It is horrible,"This may be 1999's worst album the only reason it sold so well was because people were curious to hear what she sounded like. After listening to Waiting for tonight I realize she will be shelved away as a one hit wonder, Her voice is so irritating and studio created that I can't really imagine anyone buying the album and saying it was good."
1,Worst album this year,"Its not even her lack of class that offends me i think its more her lack of vocal talents and sincerity. She is attractive but i would kill myself if had her look not into it. But anyhow, this album is sooooo over-rated and the worst song is waiting for tonight, its so repetetive and its clearly a studio creation. go back to the bronx"
1,Terriblemente terrible!!!!,"There is nothing good to say about this CD. Jennifer Lopez doesn't have any voice to sing. Jennifer, stick to dancing!!!"
2,not bad if you don't unwrap it,"If you feel compelled to purchase this album, you may want to heed this little tidbit of information: It isn't good. I admire Jennifer for having an interest in music. I also admire her for being really hot. But Jennifer, please save music for the musicians. You already have a job. It's called being a hot chick. The only excuse I can see for buying this CD is the cover picture. It's really nice. You can then use the disc as a coaster or a frisbee or something. Just keep the album away from any CD playing device and you'll be fine."
1,This album is not worth your money...,"Look, it seems as if most of the people that have given her five stars are just big fans of the person.. Rate her for her musical talents and not her as a person. Disregard the fact that she is so popular and nice or whatever else you all think about her, and think about her music. It sucks (with the exception of that duet with Mark Anthony), and I think she should stick to acting and dancing. She has no creative drive in terms of lyrics (I'm not sure she even wrote them), and her voice is just kind of annoying (it seems like she's trying too hard). I am hispanic and from the Bronx and take the 6 train every once in a while (Really!), I'm not lying about this, so if anyone should be proud of her it should be me, and I am extremely happy for her success. But if you want good quality music, try listening to Julio Iglesias, the smiths, the cure, depeche mode, and U2."
3,"It's not that bad, her voice is very interesting","I recently purchased this item, and I agree with everyone else; Jennifer Lopez can't sing. But to me, her voice is very interesting. Some of my favorite songs are ""If You Had My Love,"" ""Too Late,"" ""Feelin' So Good,"" and ""Waiting for Tonight."" Some of the songs are in Spanish, and it's not that easy to follow along with, but still they are very interesting. I don't know where anybody got that this is a dance album, that's just because most of the songs have a marimba beat in the background. I have to say, that if you buy this album, it's not one of those albums that you can pop in and listen to. You gotta skip around a little bit!"
2,can't sing can dance,"She can't sing. All the artist these days don't have tallent all they do is show their bodies, and looks to get people to buy their junk."
4,on the 6,"As we all know Jennifer Lopez is not the greatest singer in the world but she does put out some great pop music. ON THE 6 is a good example of that. With smash hits like ""if you had my love"" and ""waiting for tonight"", ON THE 6 is a great debut. Besides the smash singles, songs like ""should've never"", ""no me ames"", ""promise me you'll try"" and ""talk about us"" are great ballads. Even though Jennifer's range was limited it turned out well. Overall I enjoyed ON THE 6. It's a great mix of ballads, hot dance numbers, and R&B/latin influences. At first I thought that Jennifer wouldn't go far with her singing career but ON THE 6 proves that she's got what it takes."
1,"Enough of the Jennifer Lopez craze, already!","Sheesh! This girl, great as an actress, has insured her whole body for a billion dollars, and she wanna show off her behind to men. Also, she wants to draw pre-teens and teenage girls alike onto HER side instead onto God's side. And the great Puerto Rican crooner Marc Anthony's not helping anything. I will exclude ""If You Had My Love"" from all this, though, but its video is too fresh. The song should have gone, ""If I had a voice and I turned away from sin, would God comfort me?""Bottom line: buy this album at your own risk."
2,ILLLLLLLLLLLLLLK,"""I went out and recorded my own demo.."" This is what she said on television. I wonder if her voice on that demo was as studio-enhanced as on this, her first album. I guess good looks will get you to high places. What saves this album, are its special guest artists. If not for that, this was an over-hyped debut. I didn't buy this CD, it was a gift. But man, would I have been pretty upset. I think someone nailed it right on the head earlier-Where is her voice? still On the 6?"
3,"A good actress,a medium dancer and a medium singer","Well people,it's only my personal opinion,I'm not professional or something.In my view Jennifer definately has charisma and acting talent but I don't really think she has a musical gift.I think her best performance on the cd is her duet with Marc Antony 'No me ames'it's just classic but I can't say the other songs seem memorable.'If you had my love'is a good song ,highly beloved by the radio but anyway it doesn't require much vocal skill.So don't get me wrong ,I'm not envious or something but definately Jennifer has a lot of more to work on."
3,The beauty has an ok first attempt,"Jennifer is great at combining pure hip-hop with a bit of Latin soul. That shines through in many of the catchy songs included on her first album. Her first single ""If you had my love"" is a great example of this. However many of her songs are just too slow and don't have enough power to be hits. Her voice is sweet, but a bit uncapable. Jennifer has potential which shows in about half of this album, but she's not all the way yet."
2,2 stars for the 2 stars.,"""If You Had My Love"" is a groovy, top notch, dance track. Very impressive lead single. The composition grabs you and won't let go. The production isn't tired and the vocal is just right and crisp. The ONLY drawback to this track is that I would have preferred the coda / intermission instrumentation on the LP (only heard in the video).""Waiting For Tonight"" isn't as strong as IFHML, but this song does drive you to the dancefloor and is great ear candy.2 stars. The other tracks are horrid."
2,This Debut is Lacking,"Jennifer Lopez burst onto the music scene in 1999, right in time for the summer. Her debut single ""If You Had My Love"" was just burnin up the chart. I thought why not check out her album. Sadly I was disapointed, this album has strong moments but overall falls flat in the end. The highlight is definately ""Waiting For Tonight"", the album's second single, however Hex's Momentous Radio Mix of this song is much better than the original version. Other winners include the upbeat ""Lets Get Loud"" and the R&B tinged ""Feelin So Good"". The rest of the album is weighed down by boring ballads which don't suit her voice very well, the only good ballads are ""Talk About Us"" and ""Should've Never"". Overall a very bland album."
3,Jennifer is certainly beautiful pero....,"Jennifer is alot of things- a great actres, an adequate dancer, beautiful, a successful latina....but lets get real. And she had the nerve to sing with my Marc Anthony (I love you Marc but you knew you were wrong for lowering your standards like that)!!! Yes, the Cd is decent because of the beats and latin hip-hopflavors. But imagine someone like Lissete Melendez or Selena singing to them. That would be awesome!!!! Know why? 'Cause she can sing!!! Basically Jennifer ...keep your acting contrat in tac!!"
5,Who Knew that Jennifer could sing?,"The two Cds I bought during the ""Latin Explosion"" in 1999 were Ricky Martin's and Jennifer Lopez's CDs. Jennifer Lopez's CD was better because it has more upbeat songs, for example, ""Let's Get Loud"". I always dance to that song whenever it comes up. I also like ""No Me Ames""(the salsa version). Can you imagine me listening to this CD on #12 bus in Brooklyn?I admit it. I did not even know that Jennifer Lopez could sing!!! She sang a little bit in ""Selena"", but she did not sing throughout the movie."
3,"OK DEBUT ALBUM FROM LOPEZ, BUT VOICE NEEDS WORK","Jennifer Lopez album On the 6 is pretty good. But Lopez should cater more to dance songs than ballads, because her voice does not hold up well.Unfortunately Lopez needs the gifts of Music Technician Wizards to wash her voice out.There are some great dance cuts however like #1 smash IF YOU HAD MY LOVE, the hot latin cut of LETS GET LOUD, perfect for aerobics, and my favorite WAITING FOR TONIGHT. The other favorite of mine is the next single FEELIN' SO GOOD.However the album gets washed down with a poor duet with Marc Anthony, and the other slow drown outs, where Lopez' voice actually gets embarrassing.Jennifer word to the wise, put out a full dance, latin album, and you will have a SMASH on your hands."
3,Actress-turned-singer does have potential and time will tell,"Several songs off ON THE 6 are pretty good and very danceable esp the current release WAITNG FOR TONIGHT and the #1 smash IF YOU HAD MY LOVE. Remixes of the #1 smash were even more excellent than the original. The rest of the album are a mixture of dance, latin-influenced and R&B hip-hop music. Generally, Miss Lopez shows good promise but the album lacks a clear direction. With time she will do much better. Her voice is not that bad,after all, with a sexy twang! Banging on her sensuality and actress status plus another surefire TOP TEN smash with Tonight, she will turn out fine!"
1,Poor song choice emphasizes limited vocal range,"Jennifer Lopez is a very talented actress, but a talented singer she is not - at least, not on this album. You can hear inklings of talent hidden in her music, but the songs chosen for this album only emphasis her lack of range instead of helping it. The synthesized instruments are too high and all in the same range as her voice. It ends up making it quite clear how small her range is. More bass and contrasting arrangements would have gone a long way towards making her a more interesting singer.Most of the songs are uninspired and sound like watered down versions of other artists' songs. ""It's Too Late"" sounds eerily similar in stylings to Brandy's ""Learn the Hard Way."" Lopez has several great songwriters on her album who sold her mediocre songs.Although she has a limited vocal range, it's easy to see that with better music and arrangements, Jennifer Lopez could create a really good album. Unfortunately, this album doesn't come anywhere close."
5,This cd kicks azz,"Before I bought the cd I didn't think it was going to be all that good, but I loved it. There are some songs that are not as good as others, but I think they are all good. The ones that I liked the best are, ""Too Late"", Feelin So Good"", ""Let's Get Loud"", ""It's Not That Serious"", and ""Open Off My Love."" If you don't have this cd yet, I recommend it. She is very talented!"
2,You'll be needing the patience of Job!,"I don't know what I expected when I purchased this game. I am new to computer games, The Sims being the first one I ever purchased. This line of games is for true jigsaw puzzle lovers only!It took me forever to get through the ""easy"" level and when I entered the mansion at last, I was privy to very few of the areas in trying to solve the mystery. In order to have more access inside you must put the mansion puzzle together four or five times with each level having exceedingly smaller pieces. I've not been back to start that yet and it my be the dead of winter before I do. If you love puzzles this is your game -- if like me, you're not very patient, skip it!"
5,"Still wiping the tears from my cheeks, an hour later....","Based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel, Namesake is a charming and touching movie about the power of love and the importance of family, culture, and traditions.This is a beautiful story, well told, perfectly edited, and masterfully shot.In the extra features, we learn that the director filmed several of the scenes based on famous photographs. This makes perfect sense as the film is artistically shot."
5,A Fun Book,"This book is a lot of fun and does capture the sanuk (joy) spirit of the way Thailand is, especially the bar scene. There is the other side to the bar scene in which some of the girls fall into gambling or drugs and the writer mentions this but doesn't dwell on it. Which is OK because most bargirls don't end up as drug addicts.A lot of guys fall in love too quickly with Thai bargirls and then there might be problems later but that could be said for bargirls and men who love them anywhere. Barrett stresses the positive but seems to have researched well, and I have read his novel, Kingdom of Make-Believe, so I know that he knows Thailand well.Again half the book is on bars but this is probably OK because Thailand nightlife is what is world famous. Some are really cute but the construction workers in the first section have my vote.All in all a well done fun book and full of info for anybody who is about to go there..."
2,I thought the book was very confusing.,I thought the book was very confusing but I liked the way it protrayed the father-son relationship. I thought that Wideman used many stereotypes of whites in the south that he really didn't need to write about. overall the book was decent but it seemed to jump around a little too much for me.
3,I enjoyed the book but I he dwelled too much on race.,"I enjoyed the book and the story it told but I think he dwelled too much on the issue of race. Wideman has very strong views on race, which he is entilled to. But I feel he ties it in with everything he does in his life and that is unnecissary. I think he needs to stop looking at race for an answer to everything. The story of Wideman's trip is an intersting one. Even though it tends to get very monotomous. Overall it was an okay book, but I wouldn't really recommend it to a close friend."
5,very nice product,This product is well worth every penny of it. And the service of the store is magnificant
4,Good Saw,"I purchased this saw last year. After working with it since then I have a few observations that I would like to share.First, I am glad that I bought this before the price went up.Second, it is more heavy than I anticipated.Third, This saw is a dream to own. It works as well as I could have hoped.Now for the Cons:It is not made in the USA.Table could be larger.I want everyone to understand that if you truly are looking for a Bandsaw, this one is the right one for the price. I also purchased the riser kit for this saw and I could not be happier. I also purchased the updated fence and there is a few issues with the fence but again I cannot complain."
1,Welcome to a Customer Service Nightmare,"If you value customer service and the ability to easily return defective or mistakenly shipped items you do not want to deal with Grizzly. I have been a Grizzly customer for almost ten years and most of the time things go okay. The equipment is decent quality for a good price.When things don't go okay you are up a creek. You are now in the world where the customer takes all responsibility and returns can take months to complete correctly. For me this is a huge deal. I have a policy not to deal with companies that infuriate me. I am a pretty mellow, fair minded person. When dealing with a company makes me want to pound my fist against the table I stop dealing with them. Grizzly is one of these."
5,The Comedy of the Century,"Personally, I'd say that seasons 3 and 4 are the funniest of the ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" series. Packed with laughs till the point it bursts, Ray and his family will have your bellybutton hurtin like it never did before. A must-have for comedy lovers!!! Frank Barone's one-liners are one of the key factors in making this series funny. Kudos to Frank~!"
5,Great,Came quickly and love seeing the old shows. Now my husband doesnt have to stay up late to see Raymond reruns on TV
4,8th grade Reading SOL,This is a wonderful resource for the 8th grade Reading SOL. It's difficult to find; I'm not sure it's even in print any longer. I've used it with great success for years and haven't found anything that's as complete with a good readability level.
2,Motel room coffee,"This product is probably good enough I suppose for it's intended use, but not strong or flavorful enough to satisfy someone looking for a good cup of coffee."
1,Just not that good.,"I don't know why anyone would pay 3 times the price for this coffee.don't be fooled, there are other brands that will work with your coffeemaker just as well without the price gouging......."
5,Best Bang For Your Buck,"This Dewalt kit is not only priced right, but it is of top-notch quality. What else would you expect from a brand such as Dewalt? Both the reciprocating saw and the hammerdrill/driver are very powerful and stand up to even the toughest abuse. The batteries seem to last forever before they go dead. The box could have been a little better, as far as a secure bit storage compartment, but this was already pointed out by another reviewer. All in all, a steal of a deal from Dewalt. Get em' while they last!"
5,Great Book love looking through other peoples work!,I had this book recommended to me by a Engineer at the machine shop I work in. It turned out he was right it was a great buy. If you're reading the reviews contemplating getting this book you should do it. Its what it is a bed side reader but there's still plenty of projects and tips and plenty of great little stories that go with each plan or tip on how he came upon it.Any home hobbyist or machinist like myself should have this in their bookshelf.
4,4 star item for the price of 3 star stuff.,"This Round mechanical thermostat works with any single option eg. heat or cool only models.You can use it with any 24V gas, oil, steam, or hot water heating or central electric cooling where you don't need to control both hot and cool systems at once.Very easy to install and works fine within defined parameter, Works on 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-wire applications. Temperature range: 42 F. to 88 F."
5,"Quality, medium weight line!","Needed a replacement cable for my dogs. I have two dogs, 20 and 25lbs. This works well for them. Not too heavy, they are able to pull it around the yard with no problem. The cable has little 'memory' and uncoils with no trouble at all! Wonderful! It also has a spring/shock absorber on one end, in case the dogs run and hit the end of the cable. We've had this for about a month, and are very happy with it."
3,quick and dirty,"Cheap and Easy is packed with quick and dirty tips and pointers. It provides a good starting point for those of us who have written a book, but are clueless how to begin self-publishing. It's a small book, but worth the money. I wish Wayne Perkins would write a more in-depth sequel. Those who buy this book might want to make their next purchase: ""How to Publish and Promote Online"" by M J Rose and Angela Adair-Hoy, which goes into more depth and contains articles by many successful self-publishers."
2,Bought the cheapest phone got what I paid for,I bought the cheapest phone and that is what I got. It does not show when I have messages (from the phone company). It feels and sounds like you are talking into the wall. I can hear the other person fine. If you are not constantly going to be talking on the phone then it is fine.You get what you pay for. Next time I will spend more.
1,GE Cordless 2.4 Ghz phone,"We received the phones on time but uppon receiveing them only one of the phones worked. It charges up but is unable to make a connection, it is the extension phone, not the main base phone. I am not sure how to handle this because it has been nearly 6 months, however it has never worked. I just didn't know how to handle the problem.I'm not satisfied at all with the GE Phones, they have never worked and still don't work.Thanks,"
4,Financial Advice 101,"Like a 101 course in college, this book does live up to its title. For someone who is just beginning to take the steps toward financial planning, these simple things will help. Most seem like common sense, but often the obvious is overlooked. Glink gives the reader good examples and down to earth advice. She actually talks to the reader, not down to or over his head. Glink explains how simple habits can cost you money, and how paying a little extra will cost you a lot less. Depending on your personal level of financial understanding, this book can either be a tool to help with the basics or can serve as a refresher course."
5,One of the best Polish Films Ever!,"Polish films in general are dark, depressing (even the so-called comedies),and intellectual. Even though ""Edi"", retains much of the standard formula, it is also an incredibly artistic film; beautifully shot with an inspiring script.The character of Edi will stay with you long after the film has finished, and I guarantee that you will never look at a homeless person the same again!If you're interested in Polish culture or are simply looking for a break from the old-mass-produced-special effects-overloaded films out there, then look no further, this is definitely a film for you!"
3,Keep your eyes on Jesus,"A part of their Capitol 8-CDs integrale (Bear Family Records), for fans and family who prays."
4,Good service,I recently reported that the book I received from Great Time Books was not in the condition I expected.I am happy to report that Great Time Books has refunded my money. That means a lot.Nancy White
1,Indiscreation by Elizabeth Adler,"I was unable to review ""Indiscretion"" because it did not down load unto my kindle. Please advise what I have to do to receive this book!Edith Taylor"
4,Good book for beginners!,If you know NOTHING about Fireworks this is the book to have as it guides you through the most basic of tools that Fireworks has. Nothing in depth but given the small size of the book I would expect that! Easy to follow along!
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!,I tried this to save some $ and not buy the more expensive ones but after a month or so I realized how much of a piece of junk this is and bought a Sky Caddie.
2,galileo range finder,the range finder appears to be good but I don't know how to use it because there were no instructions and the batteries were missing. when I questioned amazon they sent me the wrong e-mail of the sender.
5,I Felt I Was There,"Again I'm embarassed to think that I didn't know about these guys until now. What a story! The courage and daring they had is unbelievable, especially after losing some of their own. I can only say ""thank you"" to the guys who flew these missions, and thanks to Mr. Shepard and Newman for telling us their story."
4,Learning From Legends,"I found the book very interesting. I would disagree with the reading level, however. It could be read by children in grades 2-4, but understood by somewhat younger children. The references to the various gods could be confusing to children who do not have any previous knowledge of them. The pictures are wonderful and the children I read the book to really enjoyed them. It is a great read-aloud book, and one I am going to use with students in grades 2-6 who are in resource reading classes."
5,Great business,I recieved the book in perfect condition and on time. Good book but it's require a lot of Calculus and Thermodynamic physic to understand the book.
5,"Conception, Pregnancy and Birth","I don't have childern and to be honest, i am a little worried and don't know what to expect during pregnancy this book covers everything that i need and want to know. My husband and I are currently trying to conceive and this book is very informative. The book shows you monthly exercises and it also explains what is happening to you and the baby month by month. If you are looking a book that tells you what is happening to you and the baby month by month then this is the book."
3,Serves it's purpose.,Bought this as required reading for my bachelor's program. it serves its purpose but its not a book that I will use in the future.
4,A great EP from 35007,"At the point when I am writing this review, Amazon has this item listed incorrectly. The album title is correct, but the group is 35007, and not a group called Sea of Tranquility. This EP was released on February 12th, 2001 on the Stickman label. This is the first all-instrumental release from 35007. As a warm up for their masterpiece ""Liquid"" it is a very strong indicator of what was to come. As it seems with all the CDs from this band, there isn't a bad track. This one is difficult to find, but definitely worth the effort."
2,"Well-written, okay read.",I've never read Julia James before but the back cover sounded interesting - basically an update of Cinderella. Julia James is a capable writer and the basic premise has promise. But I cannot abide weak and powerless heroines. Not having an education or piles of money does not automatically make a woman a door-mat. I would have liked to see the heroine go nose to nose with the hero rather than just have everything happen to her. But I will keep an eye out for Julia James' future books.
2,Good Bathroom Read,"An account of modern (post-Industrial Revolution) medicine's attempts to squish women under the juggernaut of progress by declaring them weak and/or unfit to achieve. While we here at History House are always suspicious of any work with an obvious political agenda (printed by The Feminist Press), the accounts of doctors and their loopy practices in the nineteenth century are a hoot. If push came to shove, we would suspect some of the wilder accounts given are probably minority views, but the prevailing notion of women as fragile bits of fluff subject to the whims of their productive systems was probably held by a majority of the docs during the period in question. Besides, it's only about ninety pages. A good bathroom read. [HistoryHouse.com]"
4,hidden gems for web site design,"I recently got hold of a copy of this book, and I was suprised about its actuality. It came out 6 years ago, but the main lessons are as valid today as they were when the book came out.Its content is quite original. For example, I have not seen the seven design concepts for navigation in cyberspace elsewhere:linking, searching, sequentialization, hierarchy, similarity, mapping, agents. I found those useful as guiding principles for the design of my own Web sites.I also liked the chapter about algorithm animation, which has been around as a concept for quite some time, but has never really picked up.The writing is somewhat academic in style, but well worth digging in."
1,?????????,"I ordered the second season number 1, and its been a month and i havent gotten it! please contact me when you see this."
1,Rich blondes and there love life WHO CARES!,"Who the hell wants to watch a show about spoiled teens and there life? This show is about only a few things, dumb blondes talking about guys, shopping, and maybe there hair. And all the guys talk about is the girls, surfing, and maybe snowboarding. Im tired of seeing the dramatic lifestyles of the rich spoiled teens. Blondes do nothing but shop, talk about guys, and do there hair. There ugly and have no ass! If you want to see this just make sure you have an advil by your side, cause you'll see a lot of crying over guys, and there dumb enough to still want to be with them."
3,I feel really bad for Jessica,"I feel really bad for Jessica, and before everyone that hates her wants to comment just wait... Okay when Jessica was dating Jason Alex was finding conniving ways to spend time with him (like when they all went out to dinner and she set it up with Casey to be alone with him) and when something did happen between Jason and Jessica, Alex attacked Jessica in Cabo and wanted to get back together with Jason, come on you know that saying it takes two to tango.I can tell every since the O.C. got big on FOX that made MTV wanted to do something different which is getting into sitcoms."
2,"Better watching it on tv, one episode at a time...","I rented this season through netflix and I fell asleep after trying to watch it for about an hour. In all seriousness, it is a pretty boring show if you watch too much of it at once. I think the second season is way better as well. The cast in this season is pretty boring, shallow, and self-centered."
4,Better than the O.C.!,"If you want to take a break from the waaayyy to dramatic show, The O.C. , then just watch this. You'll get hooked immediatley! What I like about the show is it's acctual people and their acctual lives! Please don't kill me for this, but I think Kristin should be with Stephen, not LC. Scratch that. He should be with me! jk... I think every girl wants to be with him!Anyways, it's less dramatic than the O.C.! No young gold diggers trying to poison their old husbands, or guys sailing off to Tahati (really Oregan). It's cool, interesting and just fun to watch these people gossip about each other and see what they waste their money on. However, I only reccomend this show for girls 12-30. Definatley not guys. It would be torture for them!"
2,Evaluation of Apocrypha by Kyoko Tokuno,I thought that this was going to be a book lengh publication instead of just a few paragraph. I am receiving the article on my computer. Am I supposed to use the Kindle to retrieve this article?
5,WOW!,"I was impressed, enlightened and inspired while reading this book. If you are in any way connected to developing training of any type I would highly recommend this book. Training Managers and HR/Manager types can learn much from this book as well. The CD that comes with is a huge help, all in all well worth the price.As a career trainer/educator, I speak from experience to you managers out there...if you are thinking of cutting resources or entirely removing your education department...DON'T!!! Get some folks that are smart, passionate and have read this book!"
2,"Samsung TXN2668WHF 26"" Widescreen DynaFlat HDTV TV/Monitor","Great HDTV for small rooms and the excellent price. No HDMI or DVI inputs, although the quality with Monster brand component video cables is stunning. Non-HD video is mediocre. DVD playback is excellent. There is no onboard HD tuner so you will have to have a HD tuner from you cable company or purchase one.Summary: great HD for a small room and the price."
4,"Not great writing, but worth reading","If you are an Eminem fan, I would highly recommend this book.It's not great writing, basically Eminem's bodyguard had a falling out with him and lashed out by writing a tell all book and self publishing it. But that's what makes it so fun, is that it's just another part of the Eminem drama during 1999. The guy comes across as pretty authentic, and you get some behind the scenes peeks at the drugs and the women and the beefs during those years."
1,I can't believe WB licensed this!,"The kids are obviously 10 years old in this picture, why try and pass it off as a ""Goblet of Fire"" watch?"
5,Deadheads and Froglegs,"Boy, this documentary made me want to become a member of the band. I have considered becoming a Chili Pepper for the last couple of months, and this documentary made me think harder about it. I know my skills on the harpsichord would only help the band soar higher on the charts. This is a highly recommended DVD is you want a glimpse into the everyday life of a band that is recording a new album in a house in California and are filming that process and are releasing it for fun and profit and play various instruments. If not, STAY AWAY!"
4,Great flick; disc had authorization conflict on regular DVD player,"The coverage and behind the scenes view in to the Chili Peppers world is always radical and intriguing. I really enjoyed this film and wish that it was longer. My one conflict was that the disc's origin was foreign and I was unable to play it on a DVD player. I had to alter my computer's settings to view it, which I wasn't too happy about."
5,"An excellent guide to the holidays,one I refer back to often","I bought this book several years ago in the beginning of my ""craft"" days.After being in two covens and using the holiday suggestions for ritual ideas I moved and am now solitare. I still refer back to this book,now even more so.The ideas are back to basics and not all fluffy like some neo-pagan books I've read. This book also got me to start planting my own vegtable garden!! This book is well worth the money if you're NOT looking for fluff."
4,You Can Judge It By Its Cover,"Most books are not illustrated by their authors; in fact most publishers discourage this practice. Being that the Campenellis not only authored, but also illustrated, the book, gives potential readers considerable insight to the contents just by looking at the cover. If you are drawn to the artwork, you will most likely appreciate the book, as both are warm, friendly, non-intimidating reflections on a homespun life. The Campenellis' authenticity and sincerity shine through. These are grounded, intelligent, learned people - not at all New-Agey. Reading this is somewhat like finding out the nice lady down the street is really a witch. If you like the originial Old Farmer's Almanac, you will love this. The chapters are laid out by months of the year."
1,Waste of time and money.!,"Sorry, this DVD was pretty ordinary. The choreography of dances were uninteresting overall. It would seem that some of the dances were meant to be like slow moving artwork rather than fusion forms of bellydance. I didn't enjoy it at all."
1,Metallica Is Dead,"Yes, Metallica is dead. At least the Metallica I grew up with, the Metallica that could actually play good music. The band broke up in 1997 to settle certain issues, like the Napster issue in 2001, and James Hetfield went to rehab. The band got back together, minus a decent bassist (Jason Newstead), and they decided to go all nu-metal and release a CD that completely sunk their ship. Yet in 2004, the documentary ""Some Kind Of Monster"" was released, and this CD single was released with it. Metallica is dead. They were dying in 1996 with the decent ""Load"" already. What is even worse is that I am a complete idiot and bought ""St. Anger"". I promise, I will buy ""Master Of Puppets"" really soon!"
1,How did this happen?,"How could Metallica take great songs like ""Damage Inc."" and ""Ride the Lightning"", from the early days, and massacre them like this? They brought those sonic masterpieces all the way down to the level of the train wreck that was ""St. Anger"". James' weak and incoherent voice would have been acceptable if I hadn't listened to some of Metallica's other Live releases and KNOWN that he could have done better. And why the hell is Lars still banging on tin cans instead of a real percussion set? It was that kind of drumming that utterly destroyed ""St. Anger"", yet somehow Ulrich hasn't gotten the hint yet.It's amazing. It's as if these guys were TRYING to obliterate their own songs.--Caboose"
5,Great knifes,"These knifes are amazing, we have 6 now, slowly building our set, worth the money! I would recommend Shun Knifes to anyone"
3,too rustic for my taste,"This book has pretty pictures, but focuses on a more rustic colonial home. Think charming, yet squeeky, New England Inn. I was hoping for some pictures and ideas for a more ""updated"" Colonial with larger rooms. A little less ""shabby chic"" and more ""classic decorating"".I only write this review to guide others. The book is nice and is perfect for that person who likes the older, historic-feeling home."
2,Only For Hardcore Beach Boys Fanatics,"""Carl and the Passions"" is, for the most part, a piece of (junk) album. ""You Need A Mess Of Help To Stand Alone"" is a great track to lead off the album, ""He Come Down"" is a bold chunk of pseudo gospel music and ""Marcella"" is not bad all things considered, but the rest of the album is garbage. If that weren't bad enough, ""Holland"" is an even bigger dud with the exception of ""Sail On Sailor"". The bonus E.P, ""Mt. Vernon and Fairway"" is a boring fairy tale narrated by their artist manager Jack Reiley. Stay away!!"
5,This is what I've been waiting for!,"I bought the best of. I bought the Surfs Up combo. I haven't yet heard Carl & The Passions. But I'm 0n the last song of HOLLAND and believe me, buy this set just for this one album. It starts out with the absoulte best Beach Boys song since Good Vibrations (Sail On Sailor) and ends with the second or third best Beach Boys song ever, Funky Pretty."
1,Self-hype,I don't know why anyone would buy this book when you can get the catalog for free. All it does is tell you to buy the stuff at Pottery Barn and how to use it - like we don't already know how to use a bookcase?? Don't waste your money.
1,Hated It!!!!!,"This book was a big let down. When I started reading it, I thought it was going to be pretty okay. Being a woman, I didn't really appreciate the disrespectful way in which they referenced women, but I thought.....some men ARE like that. However, when I got to the end of the book (3 1/2 hours later) I was like......COME ON NOW!!!This book must have been pushed to production. The characters were very underdeveloped. The ending seemed thrown in from out of nowhere. When I was reading the ending, I thought that Justin was going to wake up from a dream or something! It was so unrealistic. The only positive thing I can say about this book is that it was definitely a page turner. Other than that, Mr. Gainer, better luck next time!"
1,Dumb Me For Buying This,"The story line here was basic; married man who just couldn't be satisfied with just his wife.Poor, poor writing. Where was the point? Where was the excitement? I mean come one, if you are going to use an age old topic you have to make it good!!!This was not!!!"
1,Not as good as I thought it would be...,"This book is definitely not as good as I thought it would be. Especially the way the characters ""reacted"" to each other. And the end was a bunch of MESS! I wouldn't reccomend this one..."
1,Dumb as the author who wrote this book!,OK check it. I'm a true reader of African American FICTION. What the hell was this book? Friction? 'Cause it sho wasn't fiction. The story line was DUMB. The characters were DUMB <what little we knew of them> The ending was DUMB too. Now I see why this author titled his book DUMB as me. Damn! If this author is really as dumb as his book then look out! 'Cause his book was filled with SO MANY DAMN ERRORS IT WASN'T FUNNY! Save your money people. You'll be DUMD for investing in this book!
2,Not that Great,"WEll Like most of the other readers that did not enjoy this book, I too thought that the book was very simple and to the point. A lot of grammatical errors, which i think took some of the book away for me. The ending is one of the reasons that I initially got the book. I read most of the reviews and it seemed really dramatic. However, it is far from dramatic. I have heard about things like that happenning so I don't doubt that the ending is unrealistic. The ending is shocking but also predictable. The book had no depth to it, no character growth or anything. I thought it was a page turner but I looked closely and noticed the font, the spacing and the margins and I believe that if the font and the margins alone were changed, 195 pages would turn into 100. Borrow this book from someone like the LIBRARY."
2,Too soft!!!,This vibrator is small and I feel its too soft. You defenitely have to work with it for your expectations. I was not impressed with it at all. Still looking for a good G spot tickler.
1,Just never got the job done,"I've tried this product several times and it never manages to quite get the job done. Maybe it's because the vibrations are weak, or maybe it's because it's soo soft it's squishy, or maybe it's because more vibration goes to my hands then the region of interest. I don't know but it was a cheap waste of money :-("
1,no,"didn't care for it , wasn't good for me, I actually threw it away. guess I'll stick to the tried and true"
2,It died!!!!!!,"I've had this for about two weeks and it gets the job done, but the low setting gave out and then it stopped working all together! Not worth the price."
3,it ok,"I would definately not purchase this product again, it's not worth the money, it's cheap and just not fun to use, save your money and try something else."
1,Horrible,"My wife cried after she discovered she couldn't thrust and that there was virtually nothing happening in her vagina...I would highly recommend this disappointment to anyone who doesn't like orgasms. Great teaser though. This is a much less scathing review than she gave me, by the way!"
2,Problems with it first use,"Major disapointment. The smell of it is gross. The very first use the motor seemed to be having issues or there is a short in the cord, would switch back and forth to different speeds on its own. I used new energizer batteries so I know it was not the batteries. In addition this is not hooked or long enough to reach a G spot so the only stimulation it gives is clitorial which is useless if it won't keep vibrating steady. Does provide a dampener to the pocket rocket if used in conjunction though so not totally worthless I guess."
5,Ladies and Gentlemen -- YES!,"This is a great little tool that could become a woman's best friend, and a man's secret weapon. The G-Spot is a delicate area, and for the un-initiated, a source of consternation, confusion, or celebration -- if you have the right information, equipment, and desire. I have dedicated much of my professional life to the study and teaching of g-spot techniques and knowledge, and I can tell you from experience that this little baby is a wonder to behold. Any woman who has not discovered the depth of her g-spot capabilities should have one of these asap."
3,Dysfunctional cordless handset,The corded phone part worked great. Regretably the cordless handset that accompanied it didn't work right. Sometimes the buttons worked ... and sometimes they didn't. No rhyme nor reason as to when it worked and when it didn't. No notice either. Too bad as it was a gift.
3,Not as good as some models,"Because I had a great experience with a prior GE phone, I bought this phone. My boyfriend's roommate had dialed the phone with wet fingers--probably after washing dishes, but why not dry off your hands?--eventually causing the keys not to dial at all. I replaced it with the same model. The roommate had moved out, so there were no problems with the base phone, but the handset now doesn't work. You cannot hear with the handset, although the person on the other end can hear you. I'm having bad luck with this particular model. The other reviewers are right. The volume on the answering machine is too low, even when you turn up the volume to the highest setting. No problems hearing on the base phone or handset. The sound is very clear. You just need to adjust the volume."
3,Ok on a Budget,"This game pack is good for gamers who don't have a lot to spend on a major game package. The sound effects are good, and the action is good, but the graphics leave a lot to be desired in the Vegas game portion of the package. The pinball section of the package has good graphics even in high-res mode. The selection of games is good, including some games that even the larger software companies don't include. I would recommend this package to gamers who are starting out in the gaming world and need a primer to work with."
4,Just got my shaper and so far so good!,"Price can't be beat. Only drawback (so far) is the clean up of the grease and oil. Have a lot of rags and some kind of degreaser ready. They cover the bare metal with a grease/wax of some sort and put all kinds of oil in the small parts bags. On the up side, I didn't notice any rust and that's the whole idea. I was expecting much less than I got with this shaper. It has a nice fence, good fit and finish and solid running motor. There is no dust collection port on the fence, however. So, it is necessary to fabricate one to attach to the rear. I am skeptical about how well that will work though. The cutter area has many openings where chips can fly and even with rear dust collection chips will find their way out, I believe. All in all, I feel I got a good machine."
1,Belongs Listed as Fiction,"While this book alleges to be a thorough examination of the circumstances surrounding the assassination of JFK, what it actually is, is a prosecutor's brief. Virtually every one of the ""conclusions"" stated within it's pages are not only in dispute, but some are based on outright falsehoods invented out of whole cloth. The reader should be aware that it is nothing more than a theory and contains things listed as facts that have never been proven. I recommend that if you choose to read this at all, you should also read the critiques of this work of fiction, which should include the ""Whitewash"" series of books by Harold Weisberg as well as ""Rush to Judgement"" and ""PLausible Denial"", both by Mark Lane. Anyone that claims that this is a definitve examination of the assassination needs some serious therapy."
1,greedy pop stars,"Their not rock their pop. This is an album that everyone should stay away from. having an album pink. what the hell were they smoking. And for dick sunrise, I saw all of your reviews, what the hell are you doing reviewing hilary duff and britny spears for. Your review says everyone waits for what limp bizkit is doing next and then write a negative review, but your just doing the same with those pop sh*t's. You must like all that pop sh*t. It's people like you who want more music from these crapy bands like bizkit or simple plan. And if anyone is going to respond you must be that stupid to buy this album and like this band."
1,Congratulations Limp Bizkit Fans,"Now you can look back at memory lane and reminise about a band so original with a great vocalist and great band that makes other forms of nu metal sound like a broken record. If you get this album please go get some help because people practically gave up on this band 6 years ago, its time to grow up and get a life."
4,Good Value,I had a 5.8 GHz phone previous to the purchase of this one and the volume would not go loud enough. I am not divulging national secrets over the phone so the security isn't an issue that is supposed to be gained with the 5.8. (I use my cell phone for those).I am very pleased with this purchase. The caller ID and memory are the features I enjoy the most. The volume is much better. I haven't tested the range of the phone from it's base outside but it works well within the house anywhere I have taken it. It is worth the $20 that I paid for it.
1,Shermag customer support?,"I purchased this chair as a Christmas gift for my wife and baby daughter. The night I put it together I noticed the strap was broken and called to get it replaced here we are still and no replacement from the company. They have told the store where we purchased it that it is not their responsibility to replace faulty chairs. The store is trying to work with us but this company is not working with us at all. I would have loved this chair if the cushion could only stay in place. If you are thinking about buying this chair I would advise you to buy one from a company other then Shermag, because if there is something wrong with the chair it is not their fault."
3,Good book for children,"If you have a 10-15 years old, this is a nice book for him/her. This is not a history of technology book, it's more of an easy reading.Additionally, if you don't live in the US, the book makes little sense, since it is full of American references both historically and in terms of customs. On the other hand, if the lucky child who's going to receive it as a gift is American, this is yet another good reason to read this book."
3,"small ding, easy to put together","I'm going to give this 3 stars for now, just because I haven't actually placed my tv on top yet. lolThe box it shipped in was destroyed, but the packaging held up pretty well. Unfortunately there is a dig about 2 cm long right on the front, but I'm hoping some acrylic paint can touch that up.It was easy to put together and seems pretty sturdy once everything is in place."
3,So-So...lacks goal examples,"This book is a great resource for people new to the IEP world, especially before the first IEP meeting. This manual will give a great introduction into what to expect in the meeting, the jargon, the paperwork, and the placement. This book would also be a good first step if the process gets litigious. It gives the basics on how to file complaints and go through due process.However, the book is a basic overview of the whole process. I gave it only 3 stars because it is far to general in dealing with formulating goals. Even though there are vastly different goals necessary in every individual's IEP, everyone might benefit by reviewing a wide variety of examples. I would like to see many examples of real life goals for various disabilities using the actual wording, style, jargon, and technique used to indicate the goal and its measurability."

3,Very pleased with Amazon,"The Weekender will work well if a lot of care is taken. Do not handle it roughly. Take care to have 2 persons available when setting it up and proceed very cautiously, do not hammer it!! I use tie downs from the top of each leg to stakes in the ground to add extra security in case of gusty winds. I don.t think it will survive strong winds. I also own an easy-up and this item is not near the quality. But it will work for my application, provide occasional shade in reletively calm weather.One final comment on Amazon. I am totaly flabergasted by the service I got from this company. Every step was easy and delivery went quickly with out a hitch. The first Weekender had a broken plastic peice at the top of the leg apon arrival and Amazon immeadiately sent out a replacement upon receipt of my emailing them about the problem. I have not seen service like this in many years"
5,Get it. It's hot!,"Your kids will love this wonderful video. It teaches children about self-defense without any of the hype or violence we see so much of on TV today. And the characters even sing, too... Great music. I give it two thumbs up! Highly recommended."
1,Not any magic here!,"I really couldn't believe I bought this video. Based on the reviews it sounded pretty good. Well, as an experienced martial artist and instructor (40+ years)I have to say that this video is a bad joke. It is the most ridiculous piece of junk I've ever viewed. The best advice for children offered up in this cartoon is to 'run away.' Sound advice yes-- but the rest of the content is pure junk. Don't waste a penny on this one. Take your children to a dojo but realize that any child will be hard pressed to perform the techniques they will learn. Teach them to be aware of their surroundings. The best defense for a child? Run and scream.This video is bad. Period."
2,Buy a Fleetwood Mac video instead,"I had really high expectations for this title. But sadly, Lindsey's best work is the old stuff. Much of what's here is not up to the standards of his work from the Mac and Buckingham-Nicks. Even the duet with Stevie, ""Never Going Back Again"" seemed labored and unrehearsed. Lindsey Buckingham is one of my favorite guitarists and he let it fly a few times on this video. But overall I'm disappointed. It would be better to buy one of the FM videos instead."
2,Not very good,"I am a big fan of LB, but this show is very average at best, the PBS special from '93 in Chicago was a 5 star show, too bad they never released it. Try and get your hands on it but I would pass on this one. I love the song ""Something's Gotta Change Your Mind"" but the other stuff was weak, even ""Big Love"" wasn't that great... the version from the Boston show is tons better."
5,Expensive but pretty,"Expensive but classy looking. If it is going to be hanging around your living room, it might as well look nice, assuming you have this much money to throw around. The cat doesn't care, of course. We have had this for over a year with 2 cats and it still looks nice. Our big cat really likes to reach up and s-t-r-e-t-c-h her back out. You can make the same thing with 1/2 of a fencepost (dont' use pressure treated lumber), a carpet scrap, a square of plywood, and some screws and nails. But this looks really really nice."
2,NOT MUCH SCRATCHING,CATS DID NOT RESPOND TO THIS POST. THEY'D RATHER PLAY WITH THE INTERACTIVE TOY. TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE PURPOSE IT'S USED FOR.
3,cats wouldn't use it,"This post looks nice and has good build quality. It took only a few minutes to put together.Unfortunately, my cats won't use it! This post is made of sisal, but my cats are used to sisal with a more rope-like quality. This sisal is woven, and for whatever reason they just refuse to use it to scratch. Just be aware that your cats may be like mine, especially if they're used to a post with a different texture. As it would have cost $20 to ship it back to Amazon, I donated the post to a local animal aid society."
5,This is Simply the Best,"I have never had a scratching post my cats used as well or as consistently as this one. Even my longest cats are able to stretch the way they want. I put it in front of the corner of my couch, and they haven't touched my couch or chair since. It is so stable that when one of my cats gets wound up and races in and jumps at it, it barely moves. This is a great, great scratcher, and the sisal doesn't encourage the cats to claw at carpets, either."
3,"Please kitty, it's for you.","The product was easy to put together, is sturdy and not disgustingly awkward or ugly. Just don't know how to get kitty to realize it is for her use only. She won't even sit on the top platform and since it is higher than anything else she can get on this is odd. I have rubbed the fabric with catnip, pressed her claws onto it and she acts like I'm torturing her. I've given up at this point and hope she will eventually explore it on her own. What really amazes me is that she hasn't examined it carefully which she does every new bag and parcel that enters the house.Fortunately I got this while it was on a one day sale and got free shipping."
4,Happy cats,"I bought this to replace an old scratching post that was beginning to shred and fall apart, and I was a little concerned that the cats wouldn't be happy with the change. I placed it next to the old one, rubbed catnip all over it and let them adjust for a day or two. Then I started putting toys on the top of it so they would stretch up to knock the toys down. The old post was history in less than a week and I have happy cats."
4,My cats LOVE this post!,My old furniture actually had holes in it from my two large cats sharpening their claws on it. I had decided to buy new furniture but I didn't want them to ruin my investment so I bought this post first.It took a few days for them to start using it but they absolutely love it and have not offered to scratch the new furniture at all. My 18 pound cat is very rough with his scratching but this post can take it without tipping over! It is very sturdy and stands up well to both cats using it daily.
2,Nice -- if your cat likes it...,"This is a nice looking product and seems to be well-made. I've gotten lots of compliments on it from people visiting--it's not as ugly as some alternatives. But it's a gamble if your cat will like it--mine doesn't. She's used it a couple times when I've put catnip on it, but usually even after adding catnip she passes right on by. She prefers a cardboard scratch pad from Target. Wish I would've know before I shelled out the money for this!"
4,One cat uses it every day,One of my two cats uses it a couple times a day so it was worth the price. It is good for the cat to scratch and stretch their muscles.
2,My cat does not use it,"It is stable, which is very nice. However, my cat will not use it as she doesn't like the materials. I didn't return it because it would be too much of a hassle. Had I bought this at a pet store, I could have returned it easily. Disappointed!"
1,My cats pay it no mind,"Two Ocicat kittens, they don't care about this post, they won't scratch on it. It just takes up space,and gives them a place to launch from onto something else more interesting. They scratch the carpet instead. An expensive disappointment, but you just never know what individual kitties will like!"
5,Two cats..love to scratch!,"Could not find a tall post in pet stores and found this on line. I have two long and lanky cats that love to stretch out when they scratch.. this is perfect for them. Woodwork scratching is a thing of the past! As an aside, save the box... it's the best toy ever!"
3,Not so much,"I needed to replace several cat condos with scratcher inserts. After reading all the glowing reviews, I figured my cats would probably love this. NOT SO MUCH. My cats who are all active scratchers on other kitty products completely ignored this post. I did the scratching, put cat nip on it, played with toys and string on it, layed it on it's side.... while they would scratch as long as I was there, the rest of the time it went ignored. It's been a couple of months since the purchase and I almost donated it to the local shelter. BUT I moved this post into another room (just got new carpet) and much to my surprise it's now getting some use! Another reviewer had a smiliar experience."
4,worth the money,I was dubious about buying a scratching post this expensive but I'm really glad I did. The cats were going after our new wood work and they pretty much stopped after buying this. Plus it blends in pretty well and isn't super ugly so I don't mind it in my living room. The cats use it every day.
5,Saved my new couch,"Simba loves this! We got a new living room set and were very concerned because she literally scratched our last love seat to ribbons on one of the corners. Nothing stopped her. We found that it was because we had inadequate scratching posts. They were too short and cats like to stretch out. This was expensive so I was hesitant, but it was well worth the money. She uses this post exclusively to scratch on and has never touched the new furniture. You have to sit it on one of the corners of the furniture where she scratches the most. It took her a couple days, but she loves, loves, loves it. She goes to it and stretches out on it and scratches her claws all over it. There are little kitty claws on the floor all around that you have to sweep up. Bought one for my mother in law who has 4 cats."
3,Cat Scratching Post,"I was really hoping to be one of the hugely happy customers for this product, but just okay is the best I can do. We have five cats who for the most part don't scratch the furniture, but the occasional incident had turned into a bit more freguent. We decided to try a sturdier scratch post to see if that would resolve our issue. Two of our cats use the new post and the others just ignore it. We've tried the play inticements and the physical showing them the new post, to no avail. The scratch post is very sturdy, doesn't look bad in our living room, and will clearly last for a very long time."
2,"Looks Nice, But Doesn't Attract Kitties","I really, really wanted to like this scratching post. It has a more modern look than other scratching posts. But, the kitties aren't really interested in using it. In fact, one of the kitties prefers to scratch on the carpet instead of this post. I also purchased the Molly and Friends sisal-wrapped post, and my carpet-scratching kitty immediately went for it instead. If you know that your kitty already prefers this style of post (sisal-woven), this Ultimate Post is a great item. However, if your kitties prefer the sisal-wrapped posts, I would recommend the Molly and Friends posts instead."
5,The only one my cat will use,This scratching post is wonderful! We've bought several in the past that my cat wouldn't even touch. She started scratching this as soon as I got it out of the box. I did give her extra encouragement once it was set up by giving her treats when she used it and I crushed some catnip into the sisal. I also periodically scratch it too and she sees/hears me and comes running to scratch with me. I am extremely happy with this product.
4,With hardly any Brian in sight they work wonders.....,"Till I die and Surf's up are the best songs, but over all, Sunflower is the best album of the two and actually one of the best BB albums.Of course one has to confirm that Brian was the genius of the group (and I agree) but Sunflower is simply a great early 70's album by any standard. Great musicianship, great singing and (even) great arranging of instruments. Just compare it to any a;lbum of 1970 / 71 and it will stand up. It's just that they had a legacy that pursued them (to this day, I might add...)."
3,Long Promised Road,"A few standouts on an otherwise slightly uneven album set. Songs like ""Feel Flows"", ""Long Promised Road"", ""Forever"", ""Til I Die"" and the revised ""Surf's Up"" allow this to be quite an enjoyable work. However too many filler tunes prevent this from becoming a classic in the same vain as the Friends/20-20 CD."
5,Beach Boys 1970 & 1971,"The Beach Boys/ Sunflower & Surf's Up (Capitol/Brother - two albums on one CD): The first album is Sunflower. This is a nice album, much better than I expected, but not an essential album. The second album on this CD is Surf's Up. The title track was a huge hit, but the whole album is excellent. Both these albums are products of their time and so they are dated as far as context, but having liked Sunflower and loved Surf's Up, I think this CD deserves five stars. This CD is not, on the whole, in the exciting style of their early albums, but this double album CD certainly merits more respect than it is generally given."
5,The perfect book at the perfect time.,This Thesaurus was exactly what I needed in order to awaken the sleeping but educated mind. I really like the way it is set-up and the ease of use. I bought it specifically to help me with my book and it has motivatd this old brain back into the use and grace of words. In the market for a great thesaurus....its this one.
3,Basic telephones,"If all you want is a phone at a good price, this is recommended. They work and they do have caller ID which was about all I wanted. The LCD screen is very hard to read; the letter size is too small and the light is too dim."
1,Please Give These Coaches A Reality Check,"The author had a very difficult task in this book, how to make all these stories not sound similar.He fails.There is not one shred of objective reporting. And his fawning and kissing up to all the coaches is rather pathetic.BTW, the book says Ralph Fridgen says Harrison, NY is working-class. Yeah, like Palm Beach, FL is working class. Doesn't Ballantine Books have editors? Or did Brian Curtis accept EVERYTHING said to him without questioning a word.I also thought the remark that college sports is like the work world is incredibly naive.After reading this book (after waking up a few times) I wondered what would happen if some of these coaches put the same effort and dedication into something useful."
4,You Love Football? Get this book!,"In this work we are taken inside the lives of numerous college football coaches as they basically do their job which is no small thing.We share with them as they analyze their games, recruit high school players, deal with the media and take care of the players in all areas. The author does an outstanding job of putting the reader right in the middle of the muddle, so to speak.If you are a football fan and want to know more of the inside workings this book will be a treasure for you. A hard realistic look at the workings of college football and all it entails."
2,Buttons are flakey,"I had the same experience as some others here. It worked great for a while. After a year or so, the buttons got progressively worse. Programming it got more and more difficult but still doable. However, now the run mode selector does not work, and it only works in manual mode."
2,2 Bad out of 3,"we had AC installed in our house last year. We have 2 zones. The AC company I guess worked with these Thermostats.The one downstairs has worked fine, no problems. It controls both the AC and the Heat.But 2 have already died upstairs. The forst one just blew, it wouldn't turn on the AC at all. The second one starts fine, but when the temperature reaches is goal it will not turn off. The other day we were going up tp bed and the temperature was set to 74, and the AC was still blowing and it was actually 63. Our little baby was freezing in his room. I see that other people hace similar problems with this unit that it won't stop at the temperature needed.So I am now shopping for another one, probably a Honeywell. And I will probably replace both just in case."
1,Compost Filter,"Vendor sent wrong filter since the size is not shown when ordering.Needed filter 7.5"" - 8"" and received 5.5"" Dia.Sent them an email to purchase the correct size, no answer.Probably will not reorder from this vendor"
2,Replacement Filters,The Norpro Compost Keeper Replacement Filters are not what I expected. They grow mold within a few days time. When I purchased the compost keeper the filters lasted approximatley six months.
4,Fine,"They seemed slightly bigger and stiffer than the original filters, but they do the job at keeping the odor down."
3,Not As Advertised!,"Again, this 2"" ball will do the job. however, I was lured into thinking this was the MasterLock ""No Spin"" design which says it is and shows a picture of it having the no spin notch. I even bought and Hitch Mount that was also advertised as having the no spin design. i got ripped off on both accounts as these are not as advertised. Its obvious they will work, however, buy the cheaper ones since these are more expensive and you get the less expensive one anyway. I will be discussing this matter with Amazon after writing this review."
1,Pure crap,"I've had this printer for a few years now and it is nothing but trouble. First, regardless of what version of Windows I use, the Canon software always has tons of troubles to find the printer. At random points Windows will try to reinstall the driver and fail. Then when inside the Canon programs, the printer stops working at random points. The cartriges will go dry inside a month if not printing on a regular basis, it's completely ridiculous. Stay away from multipass printers."
4,My first grownup Thermos,"Bought it used, so I don't know it's true age, but I've been using it for a year now. The metal lid also came apart from the body after I stupidly put the Thermos in the fridge. I put the cover back on and only twist from the plastic part of the lid. No biggie. The Thermos keep my liquids warm for my entire shift at work. The grip is nice and large to balance out the weight of the liquid."
3,Making Gifts in Polymer Clay,"Suprising that it is aimed for children, although the directions are veryclear and advanced."
3,Don't listen to others views...check it out for yourself,"I just want to say that Subhuman is a good film. I read up on this and it's amazing what these guys did for a low-no budget film. I take my hats off to these guys for doing it. As far as riping off Blade..not even close...two totaly different films. Mark Tuit is a smart writer, he accomplishes telling a story that makes sense and keeps you interested through out the film...it's deffinintly not your typical horror film it has more depth to it. Then just slicing off heads. Canadain veteran actor William MacDonald shines as Martin and newcomer Bryce McLaughlin is deffinatly someone to watch out for. Those who don't have expectations when watching a film and just love the enjoyment of what movie are made for....entertainment. Will really enjoy the film...Good going guys and gals."
5,Great Knob!,I did a remodel a couple of years ago and did not install knobs until I found these to match the same ones I had in my house. Great Shipping and arrived as prommised.
3,It was everything that I expected,"It has fulfilled all of my needs and more, the quality is what I had expected. It should last as long as I need."
1,Don't bother,Purchased this warmer/cooler for someone who lives in his pickup truck. It worked great for about a month and then stopped working entirely. A total waste of $50.
2,Calvin Klein Variety,I bought this for my wife and the group of fragrances is excellent but I was really disappointed by how small 4 of the 5 actually were. One of them is about 1/2 ounce which is OK but the rest are all about .2 of an ounce or less. Not a good value from CK.
3,Not for beginners,As the ad states you are expected to be familiar with acupuncture. My opinion is there should be an insruction text for cupping alone as the points are not and can not be as precise as a needle point. To much is wasted on the story of cupping. Let's face it most of us want to know how to do it and doon't really care how it came to be. I couldn't really rate the book since I could not find any other book for comparison.
5,"Great price, condition!",This was the best price I found on this out of print book. It shipped quickly and was in perfect condition. It is an amazing book. Thanks.
2,bad author,"I love the clan books. But they made a mistake letting this author do any of the books. Tremere book was the worst of the Clan books, and now they're letting him write this trilogy? I admit I didn't finish the book, but that's because I just couldn't make it. I moved on to Lasombra, and enjoying it much, much more.This book has plenty of words, but none about the clan Tremere. Which is sad, considering it's such an interesting clan. This book read more like a 3rd rate detective book. Snore."
1,"Petty, mean and shallow","Message to Milo: maybe all those teams that fired you were trying to tell you something. This book reeks with self-pity and self-promotion. Having endured Milo's tenure with the Braves, I'm not surprised at the tone of this book. Milo couldn't get along with Hank Aaron, who never had an unkind word for anyone. But apparently Milo felt Hank's little home run chase was overshadowing....Milo. If he's still working, I'm glad it's with the Astros, where he has limited influence and exposure."
2,sub par,"Little to like on the first CD. A few decent tracks on the 2nd CD. MOP has so much talent, they only need some decent production to really shine. You just don't see that here. I got 2 CD's for the price of one but I still don't feel I got my money's worth. A shame."
4,Great book ... I can hardly wait for the movie!!,"Even though this was a great book, I prefered ""Last Days of Summer"". The photography was very good. The subject matter were GREAT!"
1,Arrived in bad shape-no invoice to return it,This is the first item I received from Amazon that arrived in bad shape (paperback book bent all up) and did not have an invoice to send back. It was in different packaging than normal for Amazon-it was a brown heavy paper folder that was massacred in shipping- usually they come in boxes and have an additional cardboard piece to protect them. I am putting weights on the book to try to flatten it out. I hope I can print an invoice online because the book was not for me.
1,had my hair burned !!!!!!!!!!,"Okay, I do not generally write reviews, but after using this product I just had to write one. I got this curling iron almost 2months back, on December 2012. The curler doesn't curl, it makes circles in your hair. Then, one day, I after curling a little portion of my hair, I discovered dusts on the iron.. and yes... it was my hair, burned !! IT BURNED MY HAIR !! It burned my bed sheet too. And I just noticed that my iron does not have any auto turn off. There is no switch to turn it off or to lower the temperature as it is shown in the picture. DO NOT BUY IT !! IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY AND A SHAME FOR YOUR HAIR."
1,NO NO AND NO,"So, I bought it when I was new at curling my hair, and didn't know what sizes to get... I ended up spending more than 15 $ because I had to buy a WORKING curling Iron...It doesn't work; I wish I hadn't bought then...Lo compre cuando era nueva con los rulos, y no sabía que tamaño comprar... termine gastando más dinero porque tuve que comprar otra que si funcionara.No funciona, ojala nunca lo hubiera comprado."
1,Unhappy reader.,"This book makes many unfounded claims. It also does not accurately define many of the topics discussed such as capitalism. The author defines privilege as this hardwired, set in stone type of quality that is only granted to whites, men, heterosexuals, and nondisabled people. And, if you are from outside these social constructs you are not privileged, simple as that. I am an economist major with a minor in political science and at times the author writes about capitalism as if he were writing to Karl Marx. This book should not be used in classrooms as it is written with an agenda behind it."
3,"Talented didge player, but far too repetitious for my tastes.","I discovered David Hudson through the didgeridoo website: [sorry, Amazon edited out the website address] and since they have several pages of music with samples, I liked what I heard from the sample. Upon listening to this disc, I have to agree with the other reviewers on Amazon, that in spite of this guy's enormous talent, I find this particular cd as a whole to be much too repetitive. I might give a try to one of his other discs, as I feel like he is still worthy of checking into more, but I would recommend insteadOil & Waterby Stephen Kent. I discovered his music on the same aforementioned website and really enjoy that disc."
2,Stupid! I hate how barney looks in the dress! Eww! Cupid! Y!,"The Barney is fine.But,well,Barney,yah.Ok,but just one thing:purple! And the mushy-wushy stuff.Oh,and the ""Play time#""-I mean if he says anything he sounds like ELMER FUDD! ONE REVEIWER SAID SAID HE SOUNDS LIKE ELMER FUDD TOO!! ALSO WHEN HE SAYS PLAY-HE SAYS IT LIKE ""PWAY""-OR-""PLAA"".He sounds like a Elmer Fudd Jr.! His voice...so bad!!"
2,Not A Good Edition,"When I finally opened this book to read Russell's essays (beginning on p. 35), the binding immediately cracked and the next page came loose...not exactly what I was looking for when I bought the book.You can read all of the essays in this book, and other related ones as well, in ""Logic And Knowledge"" -- I would recommend that route ..."
4,Solid work by one of the top minds of the Century,"An excellent short introduction to the philosophy of logical atomism. The lectures should be read along with Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. Russell's logical atomism differs significantly from Wittgenstein's version of the theory but both share certain key features which make the theory distinctive. Those who enjoy ""mathematical Philosophy"" will not be disappointed."
1,Unbelievable (in a bad way),"I love adventure and survival stories but this book was pretty bad. In every paragraph the author, Peter Deleo, portrays himself as making brilliant decisions when if fact I think he made some very poor decisions. His tone is preachy and condescending and it appears that he cribbed a lot of his constant explanations from other sources. Deleo may be strong willed and very lucky, but good luck and lots of bad decisions doesn't make a good book. I would recommend ""Between a Rock and Hard Place"" by Aron Ralston or the classic ""The Long Walk - The True Story of a Trek to Freedom"" by Slavomir Rawicz."
2,Skeptical,"First, let me state that Peter DeLeo's survival for 13 days in the hostile environment of the Sierras without adequate gear or food is phemonemal even for a person in perfect health let alone with any type of injuries. That said, there are two phases of his experience where factual information is available for comparison with his story. These are the periods just before the crash and after he emerged from the mountains. In both cases, Peter's narrative deviates from the facts reported by the NTSB. Because his account deviates from known facts, it calls into question the accuracy of the remainder of his story.Repaetedly in his tale, he kept pushing himself because the lives of Lloyd and Wave depended on him surviving and finding help. He mentioned this so often that you had to wonder if this book wasn't a form of self flagellation for reasons only known to Peter himself."
5,Research,"This is a marvelous book. I bought it to find out more about the people involved there during Viking times. I found all I wanted to know about that, plus I found a very interesting and entertaining read. The information contained in this saga is priceless."
4,A book for details but not for brainstorm,"To write a good essay requires several elements. This book reveal readers a full understanding of details in how to write business correspondences formally (to avoid Grammar or expression confusions). However, you should not expect to improve your writing skills by just following up the instructions as shown on this book. After all, your logical thoughts, knowledge in speicific fields, will finally determine if you are a good writer."
4,Good,"It was the exact book i needed. it came fairly quickly, it was still in the projected time frame and it was packaged good."
4,The start of a great series,"Some of us might remember when we were kids, this alien puppet that made us laugh. He's back again.Alf was a very different comedy that no other sitcom had at that time. There's also a great sense of character from Alf that remains unmatched. The 80's style of comedy has since been abandon, so we need to turn to the DVD's if we want to keep it alive.The only reason this set doesn't recieve a full 5 stars is that in the first season, there's a certain level of intensity that we don't see until the later season, but it is still well worth the money."
2,Good show. Too bad what they've done to it...,"TV fans have been really getting bamboozled this year. With the release of The Cosby Show, Roseanne, Married... With Children: Season 4, and The Muppet Show all cut up here and there, people are slowly accepting to be satisfied with edited TV shows being released. I reckon that's a big shame because the ALF DVDs show everything that's wrong with releasing syndicated episodes. The cuts are VERY recognizable, and not only that, they've been cut even further to remove any references to songs. There's up five minutes missing from each episode, which adds up to nearly two hours of footage removed from this set. I've been pretty forgiving to other shows, but for ALF's sloppy DVD production it's a disappointment."
3,Nice But Disappointing,"It's nice to have ALF on DVD, but I'm surprised and disappointed at the edited versions of the shows. There's even one episode, ""Try to Remember"", in which an alternate scene is substituted--in the original, ALF shocks himself in the bathtub and walks out with his fur standing on end, smoke rising from his fur. On the DVD version, he walks out with his fur only slightly disheveled, and looking dazed, no smoke and no standing-on-end fur.I've always thought that a DVD box set of anything would be the definitive version, totally complete, and this is not the case with ALF. I'm surprised that Paul Fusco did not take enough pride in his most famous & successful work to make sure that it was properly preserved for posterity, for generations yet to discover how wonderful it is."
2,Edited Episodes Completely Un-necessary!!,"I live now in Europe and bought Alf Seasons 1 and 2 in Germany. Both have English as well as German versions. The best thing is they contained complete and unedited episodes. My sister in the U.S. bought these Lions Gate versions and what a difference. So much is missing in many of the episodes. But, it is just not necessary. If they can release them complete in Germany, then the full episodes exist and there is not reason at all for Lions Gate to give anything but the full versions of every one!!"
3,A classic on DVD...Finally,"While I am extremely happy to finally be able to watch ALF whenever I want. I want to point out that these are not the original uncut episodes. These episodes have been taken from the syndicated versions and not the ones that were aired on NBC during the 1986-1987 season. This was very disappointing since some of the funniest parts of each episode were edited out. Still in all, it is great to have ALF on DVD. I only hope when they issue Season 2 that they use the original un-edited episodes."
1,The show is ok. The packaging is horrible.,"The packaging for this release will make me think twice about buying anything from this studio again. The DVDs overlap, two to each side of the case. This makes it extremely difficult to get a DVD out and greatly increases the chance of breaking a disc. Had I known this before buying, I would have skipped this release."
2,Buffering is more annoying than Alf chasing cats!,"I was looking forward to rewatching this old series, but I can't watch anything that keeps ""buffering"" every few minutes."
1,Make it go away!,"WHY? Why was this released on DVD while far more deserving shows such as Golden Girls, Mama's Family and Facts of Life are not?This was one fo the worst of the 80s and the family was so annoying. No wonder Willie ended up a crackhead! Each week I prayed that Mrs. Ockmonock would discover ALF and call the army. Then the show would end with ALF laying on a dissection table and Willie & the kids being sprayed with chemicals."
3,Alf - Season One,"It was fun to watch a show that was one of my husband's favorites with our kids. Although some of the comic references were ""dated"" (i.e., the ""voice"" of President Ronald Reagan was used in one episode, but that was lost on my kids) all of the funny stuff was still funny and we enjoyed lots of laughs together."
1,Garbage!,Having seen the original 24-25 minute UNCUT episodes it is depressing to watch these mutilated episodes (some are missing 7 minutes). Alf-fans should waite for the UK-release instead of this garbage.
3,Good set to rent,"I rented the first two discs from Netflix and enjoyed them. My wife who had never seen them also enjoyed them. However, I will wait for a while and look for a set with full episodes before purchasing them.The family in Alf is much better than the families in modern sitcoms."
1,Bernhardt Crashes And Burns,"I am a fan of the author and I love his other books. That said, this book is not even worthy of an writer-beginner. You can read the so-called plot in other reviews. Instead of rooting for the heroine in this book, I was hoping that she'd have a fatal accident, since she was witten as totally without redeeming qualities. When the psycho-killer's actions are stomach-turning and the heroine is so screwed up, the novel-read turns into mental images that linger in your head like ooze left in the fridge for years. Skip this book. I say that as I would tell you...""Watch Out! You're going to step into something yucky."""
1,FLORAL PLAGARISM,"MMMMM BEFORE ALL YOU VIWERS GET TOO CARRIED AWAY WITH THE BEAUTY OF THE WORK IN THIS BOOK..DO A LITTLE RESEARCH..DE SWERTS IS BEST AS A COPIER..FOLLOWED BY CHEEK AND CHANCE .....GO LOOK AT THE PUBLISHED WORK OF BELGIAN DESIGNERS DANIEL OST, GEERT PATTYN, IVAN POLEMAN AND MONIQUE VANDEN BERGHE..THERE YOU WILL FIND THE ORIGINALS...NAUGHTY NICO TRYING TO PULL THE WOOL OVER AMERICAN VIEWERS EYES."
3,Left me in the gutter.,"The DVD has a few good pointers but not enough to keep you feeling satisfied. Some of the pointers were helpful yet redundant. There was not enough variety. However on a positive note, Walter Ray and Mark were decent with their coaching.I only recommend this to bowlers who are just starting and are looking for some guidance on the basic funadamentals that they may be lacking. If you're hoping to learn about how to position yourself according to the lane conidtions, converting spares, how to release the ball properly, this is not the DVD for you."
4,Interesting but . . .,I found te book interesting but I did have my problems with it. First off though she does a fine job organizing her immense data into a easily readable narrative/descriptive hybrid. She explains how things are and then enters into her interviews which make a great mix. The only bad part I thought was her failure to enter any important conclusions to the end of her work. However I do recommend this book especially for the South Asian in urban areas dealing with identity.
5,"""MIGUELITO CUNI/CHAPPOTTIN Y SUS ESTRELLAS""","This is a great compilation of recorded hits by that popular and internationally famous combination, ""Chappottin featuring Miguelito Cuni"". This great compilation, has a terrific sound and includes ""A Beny More"", a bolero-son recorded by Chappottin and Miguelito, for Cuba's ""EGREM"" label right after Beny More's untimely death in Havana on 2/19/63. Great effort by Spain's ""Virgin/Yerba Buena label. A must buy for all cuban music lovers!"
3,A nightingale sings,"This cd was purchased recently, I have listened twice to this cd, will lots more, I was surprised at how crystal clear and beautiful scott's voice is, I liked his version of reason to believe and loved San Francisco. Just have to say he can sing!"
1,Confused,"...Primarily, the Map is wrong. Azad Kashmir is such a beautiful part of Pakistan, and they cokmpletely miss it. They go on to show that Entire Kashmir is a part of india.The book is also missing insiders scoop. Perhaps just using this book aas a reference, and Using other guide would be better. The authors also give a fake image of Pakistans politics, and its intolerance, as a matter of fact its very tolerant...As long as you aren't calling for trouble, you're all right!"
1,Did not work!,"I was excited by this item, and carefully chose it on merit, and it did well considering its price and strength of competition. However, when it arrived, it didn't work - wouldn't turn on, with either the batteries or the 110V supply.This is a shame as it looked so good, but whoever tested it didn't do a good job, so I will be buying another make instead"
5,A fine product,"This radio has a lot of good features at a very good price: the main attraction is digital tuning on AM, FM, and shortwave bands. Sensitivity on shortwave bands is fine, thank you, mainly due to the fact that the ANT-60 portable antenna is included. Repeat, included. Do not order it separately, no matter what the ""Customers who bought this item also bought these electronics"" list says."
2,very disappointing,"Not a great book for the average person who loves the pottery barn look and wants ideas. This book has few worthwhile ideas. I felt like it was geared to someone who has large amounts of time decorating for every season and every dinner with no budget in mind. If you're interested in typing out menus for a dinner party, making a dockside dining area, or have days on end to kill getting ready for every season than this is the book for you. I got a lot more out of the living rooms book and I now believe if you have one of the books you certainly don't need any others as a lot of the information that is useful is the same."
5,One of my most prized technique books,"When Ms. Johnson called this a book of textures, she wasn't kidding. She doesn't fool around with page after page of the oft-repeated list of materials, etc., but gets right down to textures.Watercolour is the painting medium I spend most of my time in. In general I don't use how-to watercolour books because I can figure it out on my own, and frankly, I don't want to do it someone else's way...but I've found this is a good resource in considering new solutions to make things pop.I think Ms. Johnson's completed paintings are the best parts of the book. Although I appreciate seeing her ""sketchbook"" of textures complete with written instructions how to create them, seeing how they are incorporated in an actual painting brings them to life."
5,Great Book!,Love this book. If you are someone who doesn't do well with structured teaching this book is for you. I love the examples and the images are very inspiring. You feel like your peeking into someone's personal journal. Love it!
